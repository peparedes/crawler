"event","I can't believe its been more than two years since I last posted here, but the calendar doesn't lie.  How many mothers and babies are still around the community?  Any?

It would be hard to put into a nut shell exactly what has happened with her over the last two years, I could have sworn I'd updated more frequently, maybe I did, but to the community and not just in the journal side of things???

Cailee turns three in a three months!  My baby turns three, she is growing way too fast.  Is becoming way too foward.

I need to hear from other mums out there with babies the same age, to see if she is keeping up with the 'Joneses'.

Are your kids talking - lots?  Are they counting? Do they know their ABC's?  Do they jiggle along to the Wiggles, and bounce with Mickey Mouse?  Potty trained?  Out of nappies at night?

Cailee only stops talking when there's a show on that she wants to watch, otherwise she is always asking questions and playing games.  Her latest is going to the moon to rescue Goofy (thanks to a Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode), and taking everyone in the family with her.

She can count to 10 and has been able to since she was two and a couple of months.  She has a jigsaw of the alphabet and knows different letters, and associates them with different people.  J for Jayme, M for mummy, N for nanny, etc, she's just not saying AB CD EF G, etc.

She loves Mickey Mouse Club House, The Wiggles, Miss Spider, Boo, Poko and Pocoyo.  Her favourite movies are Pooh and Heffalump, Over the Hedge, Finding Nemo, Care Bears and Chicken Run.

She is potty trained during the day, so we are saving a heap in the cost of nappies, YAY!  The night training will start very shortly, I have to buy a rubber sheet, and wean her off her drink at night - hopefully before the end of the warmer weather.

Will find a nice pic of her to upload too.  I'll have to start becoming more active in this journal again, I've missed out on journaling so much about her...damn!

So who else is out there?"

"event","It's been ages since I did a proper update about Cailee in here, so I figured while I wait for the washing to dry, I may as well make an entry. (Since Aimee left the PC going when she went to bed.)

<b>Tuesday 28th December 2004</b>
Amazingly - and without any signs of discomfort - Cailee produced a tooth, her first.  Lower jaw, right hand side front. (Incisor?)

<b>Tuesday 13th January 2005</b> 
Once again, no signs of discomfort and she produced her second tooth.  Lower jaw, left hand side front (Incisor?)

I'm so lousy - these are things I should have entered as soon as they happened, but better late than never I guess.

<b>Wednesday 26th January 2005 (Australia Day)</b>
Cailee woke with very swollen gums in the upper jaw this morning, and seemed a little grisly.  She fell and bumped her chin on a friends table two weekends ago, and her upper gums have been a little swollen since then, but today they seemed even worse, so I got the teething gel out and started administering some to her gums, when I felt somethign sharp hidden amongst the sweeling.  Yep, she now has an upper tooth as well as the two lower ones.

<b>Tuesday 1st February 2005</b>
I'm still hobbling around the house today after twisting my knee on Saturday night while putting Cailee to bed.  So I wasn't up to crawling around on the floor with her, though I did try.  Instead I played from my chair, dragging her rolling phone back and forth across the floor for her to attempt to chase.

Got up and disappeared outside for a few minutes and when I came back in, she was once again playing around under the fire (we have a wall mounted gas heater in the lounge) with the cord.  The fires been disconnected for the last two months, since the warmer weather started, so there wasn't any danger, but she is quickly learning what ""No!"" and ""Ah - ahhhh...."" mean. LOL  

She drops the cord then looks over her shoulder at me.  She's becoming a little tester, she will wait a few seconds, then start again to see if the reaction from me is the same.  

Anyway, I picked her up and moved her back onto the balnket on the floor, amongst her games and watched as she commando crawled around the floor after her toys.  Then, instead of rocking back and forth on her knees as she has been wont to do over the past few weeks, she actually started to crawl forward, one hand in front of the other, followed by her knees.  *shakes head*  Now is the time I wish I had a play pen.

After a short nap, she woke, just as I was starting to feel the affects of pain killers.  Feeling drowsy, I took her to bed with me, and fed her - half hoping she'd drop back off to sleep beside me - but no chance.

I rang mum, explaining about my knee and asking if she would like to babysit for me for a few hours.  Wihtin 15 minutes she'd arrived and taken Cailee for me.  I managed a couple of hours sleep before Mark and the kids woke me.  It's so nice to wake with a baby snuggling up to you for a feed.  Cailee loves her boobie-juice.

This all prolly sounds a little disjointed, for that I apologise.  After effects of the pain killers I guess.   That and the fact that these days I can't seem to string more than a few coherent words together for love or money.

Anyway, that's the important stuff updated I guess. Except to say, I love all my kids - but Cailee is a very special little girl and I'm so glad she decided to join our family.  Who would have thought two years ago, I would have welcomed and so thoroughly loved being a new mum again."

Cailee got her first tooth on the 28th December.  She was exactly seven and a half months old.  her second tooth came in last Tuesday (eleventh January) two weeks after the first.  And I think the next one will be along any day now, considering how swollen her gums are.  Then again it could be the way she fell yesterday and mashed her upper and lower gums together.

She's trying her damndest to crawl, but keeps moving her knees forward and forgetting about her hands, then, oops - she falls face forward and bops her chin on the floor.

Will have to take more pix this week, she's now eight months old and growing so fast.  Though my neice who is three months younger is the same size as her now, if not larger.

As I'm so frequently told - I have a living doll.

And one who's starting to shoplift early too! *nod nod*

In BiLo this afternoon, I'm waiting at the checkout and Cailee's in front of me in the pusher. I'm standing staring into space, when I hear a rustling and crackling coming from Cailee's direction.  I glance down to see her leaning out of the pusher, her tiny fist closed determinedly over the top of a bag of chips.

Little thief!  But to be fair, it's the stores fault - they shouldn't have stuff so low and within easy reach of tiny hands.  

I can see I'm going to have to watch her very closely when in the supermarket, from now on."

"event","Well as I mentioned in the replies, Montana was found on Monday morning, in an abandoned house - squatted in by drugusers - by a jogger out for her morning constitutional.

The baby was returned to her parents, non the worse for wear apparently - apart from the fact the poor girl had had all her hair shaved in the hopes of disguising her!!!!!

The kidnappers?  No, it wasn't ransome, nor was it a random snatch by people disconsolate that they couldn't have children of their own.

Montana was kidnapped by a hsband and wife who already have 6 children of their own, in a remote country town in Victoria.  6 f*cking kids already and they stole someone elses!!  They then asked for protective custody!?!?!

When the news teams went to the town where they live, their kids chased the news vans, hurling abuse and throwing objects at the crews, and kicking the cars.  Now I could understand if the kids came out and said - ""Look, we're dealing with this as best we can, can you just leave us alone?""  But they were feral.  

And I'm not talking all young children either.  The two boys were in their late teens/early twenties, as was the girl.  The couple themselves are in their mid to late 40's.  No one missed the similarity to an episode of Law & Order SVU that was aired a few weeks ago, right down to shaving the poor babies head.

Thankfully Montana is back with her family where she belongs.  

But then someone decided to go one better later in the week, and some stupid woman in Queensland decided to kidnap two 5 year old boys.  Apparently there were actually three boys playing together when the woman tried to grab them all, one managed to run screaming to his parents but the other two were missing for a couple of hours - from news reports - before being found a few kilometers away.

Not sure if the woman has been found yet though... :o\

Used to be - in my day *smile* - that kids could play out on the streets until all hours, with little chance of anything happening to them - not so these days.  

*sighs* 

I feel as old as Methuselah right now...."

"event","but it pours in this house... *sighs*

Monday started off quite well considering the shitty weekend.  It wasn't raining outside, so that meant I could walk around to the Health Centre - Cailee slept for most of the way.

<lj-cut text=""... and it goes on and on and on ..."">

She was weighed and I talked to the health sister about Mother's Groups on the area, since I hadn't been offered one, and yet all the mums from my antenatal class had been given one.  (Turns out it's only open to new mothers, not mums with older kids.)  That's another rant though. ;o)

Anyway, I got home and waited for the kids to arrive home and start their chores before I went for a nap.  Aimee arrived home and went straight to the shower, some little shit had pushed her into the ditch on the way home and her clothes and school bag were covered in mud.

Bobbie came home and jumped straight on the PC to play some game that a friend (Russell) had loaded for him on Sunday night.  

Seemed strange that Melanie hadn't arrived with Aimee since they normally walked home together.  I was just about to ask Aimee where Mel was when the phone rang...

Mel was still at school, being taken to the sick bay, the teachers didn't know what was wrong, just that she couldn't stop throwing up - could I come and pick her up by car as she wouldn't be capable of walking home.  

I called mum and organised for her to go and collect Mel for me, and waited at home.  The phone rang 10 mins later, and it was mum ringing to tell me she was taking Mel straight to the doc's as she didn't look <i>right</i>.  She didn't think Cailee should really be around Mel, so would I wait at home.  No choice really, so I said to mum, call me if there was anything she needed to know.

Another 2 mins later and the phone rings again.  Mum again.  This time she tells me she's coming home to get me, and take me back to the school and that they have called an ambulance for Mel.

Panic set in.  I rang Mark to tell him to meet us at the Emergency Room as his work is on the other side of the hospital than from where we are.  Mum arrived and drove  Cailee and I to the school. I rang Chelle (a friend) and asked if she could keep an eye on Aimee and Bobbie for me, explaining where I was going and why.

We got to the school and Mum waited in the car with Cailee while I raced inside to find Mel.  The ambulance was already outside the admin building, but no one was inside just then.  

I got to the sickbay to find Carl, one of Mel's mates outside, and he looked white with worry.  He just pointed to another room and said, ""She's in there.""  

Not conducive to allaying my fears.

My leg's almost went from under me when I walked into the bathroom area of the sickbay.  Mel was sitting hunched over on the toilet, completely grey and unmoving.  I swear to God, she looked dead.  The nurse assured me she was alive, and then Mel confirmed it with a groan.

It took the ambo's more than 20 mins to finally get Mel into the ambulance and that  was after 10 mins of her inhaling some muscle relaxants and pain killers.  She doesn't remember the trip to the hospital at all, thinks she passed out when they loaded her into the ambulance, and that she only woke again when we arrived at the emergency room.  We - the ambo and I - kept her talking the whole trip because the ambo couldn't find a pulse and her lips were cyanotic (sp???), as were her fingernails and fingertips. (Black in fact!)

I haven't been so scared in all my life.  When we arrived at emergancy, Mark was waiting at the doors, and said Mum had gone to park the car, and that she shouldn't go into the ER waiting room as their was some loony tunes guy in there.

Mark ended up going into the ER with Mel, and I went down to find Mum and Cailee.  We got up to the waiting room as the loony tunes (druggy) was removed and cornered by 8 police officers outside.  There we waited for more than an hour, with no news from the nurses on how Mel was doing.  They wouldn't let me through, telling me Mark would eventually come out and see me.  

Gee <i>thanks</i>, but the last time I saw my daughter she looked close to death's door.

Finally Mark came out, and asked why I hadn't come in..... *rolls eyes*

Mel was hooked up to a drip and finally speaking, though it took another 3 - 4 hours before her colour came back.  They tested for everything and all tests came back clear.  I know they even suspected drugs, but knowing Mel we knew she wouldn't have taken them on purpose, but these days you just never know what someone may have slipped her.  Thank God she was clear.  All they could put it down to was gastro - enteritis and a severe case, at that.

They sent her home that night because Frankston hospital is having major dramas right now, and half the beds are closed.  Wonderful considering this hospital is the first Accident and Emergency Hospital on the Peninsula, and if it closes it's doors on you, you would have to travel at least 40 - 50 mins to the next nearest - being Dandenong or Monash.

Anyway, it's four days later, and Mel seems to be on the mend, she's still not got much colour and is slowly adding stuff back into her diet, but everything seems to be giving her tummy grumbles at the moment.

Added to that Cailee now has a head cold, so she's all mucusy.

</lj-cut>

I know, lovely subject matter today, wasn't it?  If I was still writing a healer, wouldn't I have fun with that one! Just consider yourselves lucky - Em got to hear all of this in gruesome detail earlier in the week. LOL"

"event","...yesterday was a day of total extremes for me.  It was one of the best days I've had in over 6 weeks, and also one of the worst.  I spent half the day in tears with a migraine that just wouldn't quit, but was able to survive the day because Cailee was a lot happier than she had been in weeks.

The post that started a flame war was put in my LJ and linked to one of the communities because I wanted to share an experience with other mothers.  Not advocating one way or another that they should deal with their child the same way, but just explaining the relief I was feeling that somewhere there may be a light at the end of the tunnel for me and Cailee.

I woke Saturday on a high, with Cailee smiling and chuckling away during her free play time, and going to sleep with nothing more than a gurgle and sigh after each feed.  For the first time in weeks I didn't dread the night hours, figuring that if she slept well during the day we would have a stress and tears free evening.

But then everything changed when the flame war began mid day on Saturday for me.  Once again I thank heaven for friends, even ones that I haven't spoken to in years/turns/months - you kept me semi sane yesterday. 

Last night my head was still swimming with the vitriol I copped from people about abuse, neglect, cruelty and meanness - and with some doubts, we began the night ritual.  Doubts set in, so much so that by bed time for us all, I was a basketcase.  I had a major row with Mark over the cat, then Cailee wouldn't settle, even after cuddles, kisses and and rocking.  

I took her to bed with me, that didn't work, I sat up and cuddled and sang low to her (though with my voice I'm not surprised she cried worse  :o\ ), tried feeding her - nothing.  By 1.00am we were both sitting in tears in the lounge room.  I can't even remember now who stopped crying first, me or her.  (Aimee said she desperately wanted to come down and see me, but didn't because she didn't want me more upset.)

Finally we both stopped, and with a deep breath I gave her the nipple again hoping she would take a feed, since it had been more than three hours since she had wanted to feed.

She finally did, and afterwards, I lay her on the play mat and for about 30 minutes she kicked and gurgled and cooed, and laughed as well.  Then she began to rub her little pudgy hands over her eyes, and yawned a couple of times.  

I got her swaddling out, and wrapped her up like a little souvlaki (greek meat wrapped parcel), and cuddled her close.  Then filled with trepidation, took her down to the bedroom and laid her in her bassinette.  The bedside lamp was on low, and she watched me closely when I spoke to her, then after tucking her in, I walked back to the lounge room to turn off the lights, still waiting for her to start crying again.  Nothing.  I went to the toilet - still listening - nothing!  Went into the bedroom and peered carefully over at her...her eyes were almost closed.

I lay down on the bed and it <b>squeaked</b> - argh!!  I quickly peeked at her over the rim of the bassinette - her eyes opened slightly but she closed them drowsily again.  Once her eyes were closed I turned off the lamp - waiting.  Nothing.

She woke again at 5.00am, and I fed her, changed her and then wrapped her again.  Took her to bed, and when I turned out the lamp, she wimpered.  I turned it back on again, and waited, not looking at her for a few minutes - just waiting.  Nothing.  When I finally looked, she was asleep.  She slept from 6.00am until almost 11am with not a murmur.

Tonight, when I laid her down, I left the lamp on low; she lay there half heartedly crying for four minutes - yes, I'm timing her - and suddenly she stopped and when I peeked over the bassinette she was asleep.  She went down at 7.00pm and it's now 11pm - she's still asleep, but I plan on waking her in a few minutes for her feed, and hopefully we'll both have a repeat of Friday night.

I know a lot of people got angry <b>with</b> me, and <b>for</b> Cailee - but the two days has been worth it for <b>us</b>.  She is finally sleeping the way a baby should - getting more than 8 hours broken sleep out of every 24.  

She is a happier baby when she is awake, and despite some believing I was abandoning her in her bedroom to cry for hours on end, I wasn't.  She was never totally alone.  She knew I was there for 90% of the time, because I was standing patting her back to calm her or using the method shown on Dr Phil of shushing the baby to sleep."

<a href=""http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,10378154%255E661,00.html"" target=""_blank"">Baby Girl Snatched</a>

Mark told me about the story earlier this afternoon, but to see the distressed mother and father on the television was heartbreaking.

Emotions have been running high in our home for the past few weeks but this brings it all home just how much we love our kids and how we would feel in the place of these parents.  My heart goes out to the parents and I pray that the baby is handed in to a police station or hospital soon.

I can't imagine how desperate the woman who took the child could be, and if she is found I hope she is able to get counselled well, but the man who helped her steal Montana, he should be shot.

You can understand to some extent when a woman either loses a child to SIDS or is told she will never have children, or delivers a stillborn child; the mental stress and anguish she would go through.  I know myself after years of trying to conceive and not being able to without the aid of fertility drugs, how hard it was for me to see other mums walking around with their babies and children and hearing of family friends who were having babies - when my arms were still empty.

This I could understand - to some extent.  But the man?  No, I can't say the same for him.  Despite knowing how much Mark loves the kids and how he would feel if ever anything happened to one of them, I couldn't see him stooping so low as to steal someone elses child as a replacement - even to appease my needs if I was so inclined.  This all prolly doesn't make sense when read, but I know it does to me in my head.

I'm usually so good with words, but lately my head can't seem to get around the easiest things.  I get tangled up in sentences...

God Bless baby Montana and her parents, and bring her home safely.

The last four or five weeks I have been having doubts and they grew with each day.  I began to dread night time because I could see how upset Cailee was getting.  Then yesterday I could see the light at the end of the tunnel and wanted to share how good I was feeling, and also show other mums who were going through the same thing, that there is a solution that will benefit the baby and them, but I guess the majority of people these days prefer to ignore some avenues in the hope of being <b><i>supermom</i></b>.  Sorry but I never said I was one and will take any advice suggested.

Mel and Aimee are vengeful at the moment.  They saw how upset I was when following advice yesterday, but even they can see that Cailee is sleeping better now.

As for leaving her to cry?  She's gone down twice today - wide awake - and slipped off to sleep on her own.

"event","Whether you agree with sleep clinic methods or not, it is a method that appears to work.  I have been very touchy lately on a number of subjects but the main one being care of children and babies.

There's an ad that's showing on the television here at the moment, it's a national ad campaign for a major health insurance company and everytime it comes on the television it makes my blood boil.

There's a couple struggling to sleep because of a babies constant crying in the background.  The woman rolls over to her husband and says ""It's your turn.""  He then gets out of bed, strolls across to the window, pushes it up and proceeds to scream ""Will you shut the ""bleeping"" baby up!  We're trying to get to ""bleeping"" sleep here!"" He then slams the window shut and the ad finishes with: ""If you're not ready for children yet, try our Couples Cover."" Or something like that.

This comes on late at night because of the bleeps, so when Cailee has been up at night, I've had the TV on in the background and see this ad on every channel in virtually every ad break.  All I can think of is the poor parents of the child and the baby itself and wishing this bloke would fall out of his bloody window.

No parent wants their child to scream all night long.  There has to be a reason for the crying, whether its growth spurts, teething or some other underlying problem.  I cringe whenever the ad comes on when I wonder if Cailee's crying has woken the neighbours.  There have been nights when the pair of us just sit and howl together in the lounge room - her because she's overtired and me because I can't settle her.  Hopefully for both of us, that is over now.

I mentioned the ad in sleep clinic yesterday, and was told of some poor woman  who lives in a caravan park with her baby, and that when her child starts screaming she worries that one of these days she's going to have the police or children's services knocking on her door to find out what she is doing to the baby.  Hopefully she doesn't have neighbours like those on the ad - and hopefully sleep clinic has helped her and her baby."

"event","I removed the last entry because it had upset so many people - including me.  Darcy, you are doing a fantastic job with your daughter and son, how you are managing is beyond me - honestly.

I am sitting here holding Cailee and wish I could say I wasn't in tears.  You all think I am a bad mother because I let her cry?  Over the past 6 weeks, she has spent approximately 5 nights out of seven crying and screaming until 4 or later in the morning.  I would rock or nurse her to sleep each time, and within 15 - 20 minutes she would be awake again or if I laid her down she would wake and start again.  

The only time she was quiet after 11pm at night was when she was suckling.  I even took her to bed with me in the hope of giving her sleep, but the moment she was in bed, she started again, and by 1am it was the distressed cry of overtiredness.  You name the solution to this and I tried it.  I spoke to the health nurses, doctors, peadiatrician, gyno and other mums and had tried every solution they suggested.  The only suggestion I hadn't resorted to was sleep clinic.

My daughter hasn't had a drop of formula - despite still having the packet in the kitchen cupboard.  She won't take expressed milk from a bottle, cup or spoon, and she won't take a dummy.  All she will take is me.  I have had two bouts in the past five weeks of mastitis due to cracked nipples because she is almost constantly on them.  The doctors had checked her out and could find no reason for her to be this way except that she had, during her sixth week growth spurt - knocked her sleep pattern out of alignment and was fighting to regain it.

The term boob nazi is one my sister in law uses to describe herself and her mothers group (offline), some of them are extremely hard line and dis any mother who chooses to feed by bottle (which includes another sister in law of mine).  Myself I breastfeed anywhere and everywhere my daughter wants fed.  Movies, theatres, buses, car's, restaurants, play's, the main street of my town - anywhere.  

But I am a firm believer in pro choice - which is why I mentioned the boob nazi's in the last post.  Some of the women in my sister in laws group would have a mother run into the ground with no sleep at all, where she becomes a danger to herself and her child rather than trying any method possible to settle the baby.  I wasn't trying to pick on any one person or group - simply saying that for me this works, and I won't be bashed/flamed for my choice.

I expected to go through entire days and nights without sleep - Cailee is my fourth child - but this has been going on for more than six weeks and is affecting my health as well as how well I can safely care for my daughter.

Whether I was cuddling her or not, she would cry herself to sleep some nights, but as soon as she was laid down she would start again.  This is not conducive to good sleep for her either, and it was not a selfish act as some of you seem to believe.

The pattern I learned at sleep clinic isn't to be followed for good and all, it was only to teach her to self settle - two days at most.  And now after only 1 day she is doing it without crying or screams.  She is laying in her cradle smiling up at me, and gurgling as I talk to her, murmurs a couple of times before she falls asleep.

A screaming baby is not what any mother wants, we all want happy smiling babies and children - sometimes its not possible with out a little intervening help. 

I am sorry for any unintended insult, after this post, I will remove myself from the group.

<lj-cut text=""""Here we go..."">

It all started on Sunday (beginning of the week *shrugs*) when Mark and I woke stunned that we had had seven hours of straight sleep.  Cailee woke at 6.30am so I got up with her, and then Mark appeared a few minutes later - it was a good way to start the week - or so I thought.

Then Monday night - same again, and she even slept through Mark's alarm at 4.30am - we thought it amazing!!! 

Then Monday night/Tuesday morning it all went haywire again.  No sleep until around 3.30/4.00am.  Tuesday night/Wednesday morning was more of the same, then Wednesday night she decided to catch up on the sleep she'd missed out on the previous two nights.  All of this when she was waking at 4.30pm in the afternoon and then cat napping for the remainder of the time, until utter exhaustion sent her to sleep in the early hours.

Thursday night/Friday morning another shitty nights sleep, which was the worst because Cailee and I had Sleep Clinic on Friday and I really needed some sleep to concentrate on what I was being told and shown.

So by Friday morning I didn't know if I was Arthur or Martha.

Then <b>Sleep Clinic</b>!  I <b>love</b> Debbie (the sleep clinic nurse).

First off she started telling me about how I was dealing with putting Cailee to bed during the night and day.  Despite what you are told in hospital it is never a good idea to feed baby until they drop off to sleep, and then lay them down in their crib or cot and hope they don't wake.  (This explains the screaming night terrors she's been having - Cailee not the nurse.)

It made sooo much sense when Debbie asked me how I would feel if I fell asleep wrapped in Mark's arms, nice and cozy and comfortable on the couch, and suddenly woke in a dark bedroom with loud snores sounding in my ears and no comfortable heartbeat and warm embrace.  (Yes, I admit it, I snore!)

This is what Cailee has been facing the past 12 weeks, total disorientation and separation.  See it <b>does</b> make sense when you look at it that way.  She isn't learning to settle herself.  As Debbie once again asked, how often do I lay down and instantly fall asleep?  Never - even after sleep deprivation.  So Cailee began her learning curve yesterday.

10.00am Friday morning, Debbie wrapped Cailee in a sheet, then laid her in a hospital bassinette, and watched <b>me</b> closely.  Cailee proceeded to scream the place down.  Since she won't take a dummy that wasn't an option, though she has begun to suck and gum at her fists. Even having her fists available to suck at/chew on didn't help.  So Debbie rewrapped her pinning her arms inside the sheet close to her body.  The arms had been flailing around for the first 10 minutes of screaming. (and yes this was hard to sit and listen to, and I desperately wanted to go pick her up and comfort her, but having Debbie and my mum sitting watching me was a deterrent - especially when Debbie was telling me how badly I wanted to go and comfort Cailee and I wanted to show I could be strong.)

So proceeded the second bout of crying - this lasted about 8 - 10 minutes before suddenly all we could hear was the sound of our conversation.  And yep, we knew this was prolly because she had exhausted herself, but she sleep for three straight hours without a murmur. She woke, I fed her and then she went down on the rug for a kick and play and spent most of the time flirting with, Dominic (10 weeks old), the little boy who was there for sleep coaching.  Cailee was all smiles and coo's at him, but being a typical boy he was playing aloofness.

It was almost time to go home, so with Deb's roster in my hot little hand, we packed Cailee in the car and came home.  I felt more confident when we left, but there was still the trauma of having to repeat the procedure at home with Aimee (and Melanie) there to watch me being <b>mean and cruel</b> to their little sister.

Aimee was the worst to deal with, she was cursing Debbie and to some degree me as well when I left Cailee in the room screaming for the full 10 minutes before going in to calm her.  Once calm I walked out again, and stood by the door waiting, and sure enough, the screams started again.  Another 10 minutes of crying and I went back in to check her again, gave her a couple of soothing pats on the back, and then walked out again.  This time the crying (not screaming) lasted for about 8 minutes, and then silence.

I went in about a minute or so after the crying stopped, and she was fast asleep.

At 6.30pm she went down again and within 5 minutes of crying she was asleep.  She was woken at 8.30pm and had her feed and a bath (which she loves) then Aimee sat and played with her until we saw the sleepy signs (rubbing nose, yawning and a small whinge) so once again I wrapped her in the sheet and laid her down.  This was more tricky because Mark had already gone to bed - he had to be up at 5.00am - but I'd warned him it had to be done.  She cried for 10 mins, but you could hear that it was more of a halfhearted attempt.

She ended up sleeping from 10.30pm last night until 5.00am this morning.  Six and a half hours isn't bad.  She went back down - awake - at 6.00am and the only sounds I heard from the dark bedroom were her talking to herself before she dozed off.  It's now 8am and I have to go and wake her for her next feed, play and sleep session and hopefully she'll go down again without a murmur after that.

There's something to be said for the way they used to have such a regimented way of dealing with newborns.  I know this may cause those who term themselves ""boob-nazi's"" to get all pissy at me, but I don't care.  It's been 11 and 1/2 years since I had a baby and I have had to relearn to whole ""dealing with baby"" thing all over again, it's like being a first time mother. 

While I like the idea of demand feeding, I think it should be used more for older babies and not newborns.  When you have a newborn, and the baby cries you assume its one of three things: hunger, discomfort (dirty nappy) or just wants a cuddle.  But when you have done all you can to cater for those three things and the baby still cries - what else can you do???  

I suspected during the previous 12 weeks that I may have overfed Cailee at times and she was feeling uncomfortable because of that, and I also suspected in the last couple of weeks that maybe she was overtired in addition.  I was right on both counts.  Because I'd missed the original ""tired signs"" I'd fed her again causing her to feel bloated, when she cried more I'd change her nappy even if it was only damp.

When all I had really need to do was lay her down and allow her to put herself to sleep - even if it meant that for a few minutes she cried.  

I know it's only been less than 24 hours since this new pattern started, but if this last 12 hours or so is any indication, things are brightening up for us all.  

And for those who think it's cruel and I'm damaging Cailee, she has been happier and less sooky in her awake and play time in the past 22 hours than she has been since she was born.  I'll update again as time goes on and I see how she fully adapts.  If any of you girls in the baby groups want more info, just leave a message.

And no, I won't take any negativity on this, it works for me and Cailee if you don't like it - <b>each to their own</b>!"

"event","...since I got a good nights sleep.

And in truth it prolly is - at least since last September when I last slept on my stomach.  But this week *sighs* has been worse than normal.

What started as the 6 week growth spurt, turned into a complete change in sleep pattern for Cailee (and me).  This last week I hadn't rested my head on my pillow until 4am minimum.  That all changed on Wedneday night though.

Cailee was awake from 4pm, after her last afternoon nap, until 8am the following day.  A light 10 minute snooze is all she took, after each feed, to wake again and scream her head off.  It got to the point where at 3am that morning I was on the phone to the sleep clinic asking for advice - and I still haven't heard from them about booking in for either the sleep class or the week long clinic. *sighs*

The phone call I made got me nowhere, and the nurse on the other end wished me well and hung up at 3.30am, telling me with any luck I'd be in bed by 4.30 anyway.

By 8am that morning I was in tears, and thanking god for my elder kids, who rescued me..

Aimee took charge of Cailee, she and Bobbie took her to the lounge room for 4 hours and amused and quietened her, while I finally got some sleep.  I was laying on the bed crying my eyes out, and thinking I was the worst mother... until they woke me at 12 noon to feed Cailee, when I fell asleep again while she fed from me.  

Woke again at 2.30/3pm, had a shower and dressed and felt like a zombie for the remainder of the day.  However, last night, Cailee fell asleep after her night feed at 10.30pm, and slept through to 2.30am.  Fed again and went back to sleep at 4.30am, and woke again at 7am.

I was feeling so good when I finished feeding her at 8.30am, that I bundled her up in the pram and Aimee and I went for a 30 minute walk with her around the nearby streets.  It's amazing what 1 good nights sleep has done for me today.

I'm not counting my chickens as far as reversal of hell week, but.... I now have a small packet of infant formula sitting on the bench and a few sterilized bottles too, so if she starts again, one drink of formula might do the trick.  (Well I can dream can't I?)

I actually went and bought the formula last night, and did all the sterilizing and stuff straight away, so even last night I was prepared.  But she fell asleep after I fed her, so I am happy I didn't have to resort to drastic measures.  

I am enjoying being her sole supplier and didn't want to have to supplementary feed her, but lack of sleep does not a happy and coherent mummy make - especially when the sleep clinic was worse than useless as far as help goes.

Anyway, she's due for her next feed shortly and I'm in need of a coffee break before hand.  Three cups I've made this morning so far, and managed to drink only one - the rest went cold while trying to settle madam.  

*hugs to all*

"event","Well after last weeks great sleeps (5.5 hours) during the night, things took a turn for the worst this week.  Sunday night, Cailee started to go through another growth spurt.  4am I finally crawled into bed, just as Mark was waking up for work.

For the first couple of nights, I had no idea what was happening, then I read an update in LJ and discovered the 6 week's spurt, and figured, yeah yeah another two nights and we'll be back to normal.  Well that didn't happen.  It's Friday night here, and last night the same thing happened.  4.30am I finally managed to crawl into bed, and was only there for about 2 mins before she started crying again.

Yes, I succumbed and pulled her into bed with me.  Not the most comfortable nights sleep I've ever had. *sighs*

We had a paediatrician appt today, and after hearing whats been going on, Anne, suggested a Sleep Class for Cailee and I.  So I'm waiting to hear from the hospital as to when I will go in.  I'll start out with a one day course at the hosp, and then if no change, I'll end up going in for about 3 - 4 days with her, until she is sleeping at night again, instead of during the day.

So far, tonight, she's been asleep for about an hour, it's 1.08am, and I haven't heard a peep, so I'm hoping that before the hospital calls, she'll revert to how she was sleeping last week.  It's either a really long growth spurt, or she really has swapped to UK/US time zones.

Everything else went well with the paed, though.  She said Cailee is a very healthy baby, who has put on muscle tone and fat deposits really well since Anne saw her last.  She was only 5 days old back then, and a really scrawny and tiny baby, now she looks like a healthy newborn.

Mark swears he saw her give a genuine smile tonight, and not a plain wind smile.  I missed out, though I have seen her laugh in her sleep a couple of times this week.  Obviously, her dreams are more amusing than I am.  :o\

Anyway, this was just a quick update.  Wish me luck with her sleep patterns.  I need her to revert right now as I only have two weeks to get Mel's Debutante Gown finished. *sighs*

Apologies to both Vix and AJ for the lack of photo in the announcement email I sent out.  The email I sent to Vix bounced from vexingvixen.com the night I came home from the hospital for an hour, and AJ I lost your email addy in the recent reformat, and didn't think AJ@ would work - sorry it wasn't done on purpose.

Anyway, I'm going to check photos on the pc and upload them - will organise display shortly.

"event","I was going to update this last week, but things went a little awry on Friday 14th.

<lj-cut text=""Birth Details"">

I went to have a scan done in preparation for being induced on Monday or Tuesday (17th/18th May).  The doc wanted to make sure that the placenta was ok, and that the cervix and everything else was favourable.  My gyno was on holidays for three weeks, so I was seeing one of his partners in the practice - and he just wanted to make sure everything was going smoothly.

Well, the scan didn't turn out as favourably as was expected, since instead of measuring 38/39 weeks, I was only measuring 35.  When I got home, I opened the scan pix and the typed results of the scan, so I could see what was going on.  I ended up ringing the gyno's office because there was mention of diastolic pressure being down to almost nil - cause for concern.

The interim gyno wasn't working that day, so I was passed along to the third partner in the practice, and he wanted to see the results himself, so I waited - not so patiently or so stresslessly at home whie he waited for a faxed report.  I ended up calling hubby, and asking him to come home, as I was having a minor (read major here) breakdown with stress.

Hubby arrived home just as the gyno called me back.  He wanted me in straight away as he wanted to induce me. The placental diastolic pressure was right down, which meant the chance of the placenta dying was high.

We arrived at the hospital within 15 minutes and within 30 mins I had had my waters broken and a drip inserted.  There was merconium in the waters, and from what the doc said, it had prolly been there for a couple of days.  He warned me this was going to be a fast labour, as he wanted Cailee out as soon as possible.  He was giving me two hours to move the labour along, or he was going in....

Mum arrived at the hospital and then I called the schools, so that the kids could be released into mum's care, to be brought to the hospital for the delivery.

By the time mum returned from the school the doc was back.  The fetal monitor showed Cailee's heartrate was dropping, and an emergency caesar was ordered.  I hardly had time to reassure the kids before Mark and I were taken down to the theatre.  Thank god Mum was there to keep the kids calm, though even she was worried by this time.

Despite the lack of pain from the spinal block, I coud still feel all the pushing and prodding, and even a trickle/tickle across my abdomen when they made the first incision - yuk.

Mark sat up with my head (that sounds weird but you know what I mean) and hid behind the curtain with me for most of the procedure, but couldn't resist watching as her head was lifted free of my abdomen.  He told me her head was out, and I felt my whole body begin to tremble as I waited to hear even a whimper from her - it seemed to take an age.  The first tremulous cry sounded, and I burst into tears.  Up until that time I had tried not to think that things could go badly, but the relief I felt, brought all the worry to the fore, and I couldn't deny how scared I had been.

Words can't describe the relief I felt, or the love that flooded through me, even before I laid eyes on her.  I had a full theatre of staff there too, there were more people in that room for the caesar than I had planned on having for a natural childbirth. And believe me, with hubby, three kids, two mothers in law as well as medical staff, I had planned on having quite a few in there. LOL

She finally emerged fully at 5.19pm, Friday 14th May.  11 days early.  She was tiny too, weighing in at only 4lb 15oz.  Though she scored well on the Apgar despite everything she'd been through.  Her first Apgar score was 7, followed by a perfect 10 five minutes later.

I've only been home since yesterday, and still feel sore and sorry for myself, but she appears to be thriving.  She feeds well, and is very alert and we are all so grateful that she is healthy.

</lj-cut>

I'll upload some photo's to Cailee's new website tomorrow, to show her off. :o)

But for now, she's awake and Aimee keeps assuring me that she is about to start crying.  That's the only downside to having three kids a lot older than the baby - they all act like they are the mother and I'm just the cow who provides the milk. *sighs*

Anyway, better head off and feed munchkin.
*hugs*
Kaysea :o)


PS Thanks to Bree and Em for the announcement last weekend! *big hugs*"

"event","Well the night before last was an eye opener.

Hadn't had a nap during the day at all, and then once hubby and the kids were in bed, I sat watching tv for a couple of hours before hitting the sack myself.

Read for an hour or so, but started getting pains in the lower pelvis, and tossed and turned from one side to the other, to try and alleviate the pressure.  Then realised I was actually getting something similar to braxton-hicks contractions - similar but different.

The tightening was occuring on the womb, but alos gravitated to my pelvis and upper thighs, and into my back.  Was not pleasant, and they were coming about 5 mins apart, regularly.  Got up and moved around a little to see if they abated as the braxton-hicks normally do, with no luck.  Went to the loo, and then back to the bedroom, where hubby woke up and as he got out of bed, said, ""I'll race you to the loo!""  

He didn't even realise I wasn't laughing.  But I took the wind out of his sails when I told him to make sure his mobile was fully charged for the day.  He then lay awake with me for a while timing the contractions.  I told him since they were still 5 mins apart, he should try and get some sleep.

At three in the morning, I got up and decided I should check my bag for the hospital - just as well I did.  I thought I had the majority of it packed, but was surprised to see all I had in there were the maternity pads, breast pads and a couple of other  miscellaneous items.  So I spent an hour or so collecting stuff from here and there, and began to pack the bag properly.

Put the washing machine on at 3am to wash a couple of things, and had to stop half way through loading it, when another bloody contraction hit.  

The whole thing lasted for about 2-3 hours and when I finally realised I needed sleep more than clean washing, I headed back to bed.  About a half hour later the contractions stopped. *damn!*

Spoke to the midwife yesterday after the water birth info class I attended, and asked her if I had just been confusing braxton-hicks with the real deal.  She said it sounded like I could be getting ready for the real thing, and just to make sure I don't leave it too long before heading to the hospital.  

So now, I just wait on pins.  The kids were hopeful I'd have gone in yesterday as one had a cross country run yesterday adn the other today.  But nothing last night, and I'm still here this morning.  The anticipation is now killing me!!

Cailee - Come out! Mum wants to see you. LOL"

"event","The running joke around this place lately, is that I have been suffering from nesting instinct. Hah!  Moi? You have <b>got</b> to be joking.

<lj-cut text=""Bitch and Moan Time"">

This is <b>not</b> a nesting instinct - this is purely and simply <i>Keep the Mothers In Law Outta the Damned House</i> instinct. :op~~~

I have been working my butt off around the place to try and get the whole house ready for Cailee so that neither my mother, nor Mark's, come around while I am in hospital to clean again, but try telling the kids that???  Yeah <b>right</b>!

Even the simplest of tasks these days seem beyond them.  Emptying the dishwasher in the mornings before they go to school - impossible.  Getting them in their rooms at any time to clean up - not a hope.  Am at my wits end right now.

The lounge, dining and kitchen are almost finished.  Well the kitchen is, and I will have the lounge done by tonight, once I have the new drawer liners for Cailee's drawers and can put all her stuff away.  

The dining room I still need a little help with, as I have to bag up a heap of old material to be donated to the school.  I doubt I'll ever get through all the odds and sods that are sitting in the bottom of the old toy (now material) box, so I may as well donate it all to the school for the artroom.

My room is done, as is the bathroom.  And the laundry - well it's a laundry so between loads of washed washing, and that waiting to be washed, I don't think it'll ever be <b>done</b>. Added to that my dryer died this weekend, and the weather has turned lousy, so I have a clothes airer full of washing, and will be for the foreseeable future.

I was on a roll last week, we went out and bought Cailee a new set of drawers and Mel bought herself a new tallboy, so finally none of them should have a reason to complain about lack of clothes space, nor an excuse to have clothes laying all around their rooms.  Well a mum can hope - can't she?

May be it <b>is</b> the nesting instinct...I just don't know.  It's not a burst of energy and worry that the place isn't sanitary enough for a baby.  I'm not going crazy with the toothbrushes and bleach or anything, I just know that the way my house is, and the way my kids are, if I don't get it under reasonable control now, it'll never happen.  And that's more depressing than anything.

</lj-cut>

Melanie asked me last week, what my main worry is, about the impending birth.  She wasn't satisfied with the answer I gave so asked for my top three.

1.  That Cailee is healthy.  This is a <b>big</b> worry since I didn't have the amnio done when I had the opportunity.

2.  That the kids don't freak out during the labour.  This is the reason I relented and told Mark that both my mum, and his, can be in the delivery too if they want to be there.  Yeppers, it'll be a mite crowded, but the room is huge...

3.  The actual birth itself.  Even though I've been through three already, I remember what each one was like, and worry that this time I may not be able to handle it as well.  Age and a stuffed back don't help. LOL

<p align=""center"">.:~*~:. .:~*~:. .:~*~:. .:~*~:. </p>


The doc has decided to allow me to go for as long as I can, now that the diabetes is under control with the injections.  Blood sugars have for the most part been really low, except for a blow out on the day of the baby shower, when I grazed all day on vegie sticks and light cream cheese dip - then stuffed up by having a couple of pieces of cake.

I asked Mark if he could guess what particular food I want the day after Cailee is born - what food I'm actually craving.  He got it in one.  Chocolate.  When I asked him why he thought that, he said - easy - I'm a diabetic, how else do you think I'd know? LOL   

Well that's all well and good, but I don't normally crave chocolate of any type, I'm a salt tooth, but right now, every time I walk past the fridge, you can hear my taste buds watering.  We have a huge chocolate egg on the top of the fridge for Easter - Mark has been using it whenever he feels low.

Melanie, Aimee and Bobbie have been storing their chocolates from Easter inside the fridge as well.  The number of times I've picked up a bloody chocolate bar wrapped in tin foil, instead of my block of cheese, only to hold it for a short time and fight temptation, before putting it back and rummaging around for the cheese... *sighs*

<lj-cut text=""Worries and Stuff"">

I want Cailee to be healthy, but I also want her out <b>now</b>.  I want to be able to see her, feel her, smell her, touch her, etc etc, the list goes on.  I also want to be able to eat what I normally eat (prolly not the best idea :o\ ) and walk for longer than a few mins before feeling aches and pains.  Selfish I know.  But I also worry about all the smoking I did during the pregnancy, and that now that I'm not eating half as much as normal, that she's not getting what she needs.

I was told the other day I don't look 37 weeks pregnant, I look smaller, which is a worry.  But now, when I lay in bed, I can feel her harder and more distinctly than I have been able to through any of my previous pregnancies.  So I wonder just how much weight I've lost over the past month or so, and if she's ok.

All these thoughts now tumble through my head.  I just want my baby to be healthy and a decent size.  Impatience is playing havoc with me right now.

Kinda down at the moment, and don't know why.  I feel as if I'm on an emotional roller coaster. :o\"

"event","I love my pharmacist!!!

Well - not really but you know what I mean. :o)

I had an appointment yesterday with the Endocrinologist (Diabetes doc) and am now officially taking insulin for control of the diabetes.

After talking to him, he said if I can lose a little more weight after the birth, and maintain it, he thinks I will have a slimmer chance than I would normally have of developing the AOD (adult onset).  When I explained about usually (prepregnancy) feeling low, and needing to increase sugars - especially when missing meals - he said it would be unlikely I will become one. *dances*

But why do I love my pharmacist?  Coz he got me the smallest/finest needles possible for the injector pen/thingy.  I was close to tears (so flaming nervous it isn't funny) when I went in to pick them up this morning, that he assured me I wouldn't feel the actual injection.  Yeah, yeah - sure thing, isn't that what they all say???

Well guess what?  he was right!!!!  I couldn't feel the damned thing at all, and I was watching to make sure it wa actually in under the skin - nothing!  It hurts more to have a blood test!!!!  Shitters, I can't wait until Mark gets home to tell him about this.  He is in pain every morning with the old syringes - he's gotta try this way.

I've noticed Cailee is way more active since I had the injection though, don't know if that's a good thing or not. :o\  Only had it 30 mins ago, and she's been rolling around ever since.  Don't know if it's the effects of the insulin or the adrenalin I've had pumping around inside for the past 50 mins.

Anyway, after this first injection - I feel so much calmer - knowing I can handle this.  Last night I was panicking thinking, if I can't do it, Mark can do me at night (no smart remarks thanks ;o) and one of the kids can do me in the mornings before they go to school - but WOW!  I can really do this myself - me - who usually passes out at a simple blood test.  Amazing!

Sorry if I'm gushing, but the last week has been a real shit-kicker and now.... just ... WOW!

*hugs* to all!

"event","Well, yesterday was a write off.  Phone calls from the gyno's office, and Doug still wasn't pleased with my blood results, so instead of having to wait almost a fortnight for an appt with the diabetic educator & dietician, he booked me into an endocrinologist for Monday morning.  He doesn't want me to have to wait another fortnight and so as of Monday I'll be on the injections to control the sugar levels. *heavy sighs*

Spent yesterday depressed, and now I'm getting anxious.  Poor Mark has been dealing with this condition for 38 years, and I feel like such a baby coz at the moment I only have to do this for the remainder of the pregnancy and I'm so scared.

The idea of having to stick pins in myself daily - it is bad enough doing the blood tests now, as my fingers are all sensitised, how will my leg's cope?  I've been told I can't inject directly into fat or muscle, so with my body that doesn't leave me much option.  I have to inject into the top of my leg where the fat deposits aren't bad.

I suppose I'll find out more on Monday. :o(

A month or so ago I was thinking how lucky I had been throughout the pregnancy, not to have had morning sickness and stuff, the tiredness I could handle.  And even joked about getting pregnant again - but now?  I'd prolly have to go on injections from day one.  And yes, I know I'm bneing selfish, but I can't help it right now."

"event","Though I'm a couple of days late thanks to the Easter public holiday and my pregnant memory.

Easter was a PITA - for me who usually doesn't go gaa-gaa over chocolate, this year I felt really hard done by being the only one in the house who wasn't allowed to eat any. :o\  And the smell of all those chocolate Easter Eggs...  :o(  My girlfriend Chelle even went out and bought one of those yoghurt Easter Eggs for me, but though it smelled wonderfully of strawberry, it tasted like soap.  Anyone want a bit?

Anyway, coz of the holiday on Monday, it was impossible to get a doc's appt that day, so I had made one for the Tuesday.  Only prob is, I have always had appt's after 5pm, so that Mark could attend with me, this time, thinking the appt was 5.15 - 5.30pm, I went out shopping with mark when he came home, and we messed around down Main Street until almost 4.30pm.  I got home and was just about to jump into the shower, when I thought to check my appt card - - 4.15pm.  Quick call to the doc's showed me I had no hope of a later appt, so I had to make it this morning instead.  Chelle - wonderful friend that she is - took me down this morning, and though there's one instance of bad news, overall I'm doing well. *GO ME!!!*

Bad news first?  I have to go on the insulin injections for the last 4 - 5 weeks or so of the pregnancy.   Can't get in to the diabetic educator for another two weeks, so I can't go on the injections until then - which didn't please the gyno at all, but it's giving me two weeks grace to try and control my blood work.

The good news?  BP is down to 130/70, and I lost 2lbs this fortnight - prolly all due to the diet I have to maintain.  Unless I take the easy way out and have takeaway - which I've done twice this week, I'm usually able to manage the blood sugar control, but the Thai meal the other night, even though it was all meat and non counting veggies, still boosted me waaaaay over.  Must have been the mini spring roll that did it. :o\

Anyway 2lbs weight loss is good, especially when you're my size.  The midwife said I'd be lighter after the baby than I was before - which has to be a good thing. *nod nod*

I saw <b>babies!!!!</b>.  New ones!!!!  Well - six week old babies.  But babies!!!!

Now I'm getting clucky!!

Even the crying one didn't get to me, and usually I can't stand other babies cries, just my own, but aww they were <b>sooo </b> cute!!!

Doug also told me there's little chance of me being brought on at 36 weeks, which is a relief.  He said that idea is so old fashioned it's not funny, and that with injections to control the insulin levels he doesn't see a prob with me carrying almost to term.

Cailee has slowed down a little in growth over the last two weeks as well.  She's still measuring for 36 weeks, but at least now there's only two weeks difference.  He said she is head down and tail up at the moment, lying in the left posterior (!?!) position.  I think posteriors the right one, where the bum is facing my stomach?  Anyway I know she's in the right place to deliver nicely, and not the back pain one, but with six weeks still to go, she could move around again.

I've been working flat out like a lizard drinking the last two days, here at the PC.  I have another website to do, this one for Chelle's business, so I haven't been slouching in the lounge room, which would prolly explain why Cailee has settled into the right possie.  After Hell's Weekend - as it shall be known from this time on, the PC has been working fine, no more reformat's!!  But it makes five days straight of actually sitting upright and not laying reclined on the sofa.

Chelle's been keeping an eye out for some nice larger sized clothes for me, at her shop and brought a heap around this morning for me to try on - she wouldn't accept a cent for any of them, despite it being $30+ worth from her price tags.  I've just washed them to get the store smell from them, but I have a lovely outfit to come home in, as well as some more pants and tops to wear in the hospital.  If I make two more pair's of stretchy pants/slacks, I think I'll be right for clothes for a little while, at least until Cailee arrives and I can walk a little more.

My feet are swollen too, but Doug said that's normal, prolly because I have been sitting at the desk for days, though I am drinking more water now than coffee or tea - hopefully it'll flush me out.

My hands are fine, though I haven't put my rings back on since the night I managed to have hands cool and slim enough to remove them.

Last antenatal class on Sunday.  Two of the women from the class where in the doc's rooms today with me, but neither of them realized who each of the other two were, I don't think, coz even when I smiled and nodded, they only smiled back.  And they didn't acknowledge each other either.  Though one did pinch my magazine and seat while I was in having my BP checked. :o\

Anyway, I've rambled on too much now, and I have emails to answer, and I need to find out the password to the site I created for the Accommodation business last month, I lost the email/paperwork in the reformat on Friday. *sighs*

"event","Sorry I confuddled you with the bread comment.  Just meant that with the other suggestions for food at midday, the only thing I feel <b>full</b> after eating is bread.  I'm allowed 4 portions of carb like stuff a day - so bread and spuds are the only thing that will fill me as far as <b>feeling</b> like I've eaten anything.

I eat tonnes of veg through out the day, and fruit, but apart from the small portions of pasta and rice, nothing else makes me feel as though I've eaten anything substantial. :o\

I'm the classic <i>meat and potatoes and forget the rest</i> - type. So the diet is hard to adjust to.  Being limited to only a couple of rounds of bread is killing me!!! arghhhhhhh *sobs*

But I must admit, dinners are doing fine at night.  I love the vegies piled high, and feel really good after that meal.  Although I slipped last night.  We had chips and chicken for dinner.  (I was feeling really lazy and got takeaway.)

Todays morning reading was a respectable 4.8 and I had two rounds of toast and scrambled eggs for brekky.  Lunch is pita bread (coz it counts less) filled with cheese and salad - minus the lettuce coz Safeways was out of it last night. (More on that in other LJ)  I also bought cream cheese spread to use instead of margarine. Go me!"

Had to take Mel to the doc last Friday eveing for her check up with her back - an MRI tomorrow for her.  But while I was there I asked for a script for the blood test monitor strips as Mark's were so far out of date it wasn't amusing!?!?! (He's <b>not</b> a good diabetic.)

When I explained that I needed the strips for me, and not hubby, the doc asked why...he's the GP not the ob/gyn..so was out of the info loop.  He asked how the blood tests had been going, and shocked the hell out of me when he said unless I can get it down, I'll prolly have to be induced early because Cailee will be larger and possibly have some complications...

I have my next Gyno appt next Tuesday (Monday is a public holiday) so I'll find out more then.  This is why they've been so concerned about my measurements being out, I measured 36 weeks last week.  Though when we went to the antenatal classes on Sunday I saw three other women who were due the same week as me, and they all looked to be roughly the same size as I am - minus the added fat. LOL

I was the one the midwife kept using as an example during class as I'm the only mum who already has children.  The kids came along, and Bobbie got a first hand viewing (on video) of a birth - his comment had the class in stitches.  When asked what he thought of the clip - ""Yuk!""  He's confirmed he's going to sit at my head during the delivery.  Though Mel is trying to convince him it could be more hazardous to his health - he'll be closer to my teeth. (I have a habit of biting hands that I'm clenching. LOL)

Overall the class went well.  The kids are more excited now than they were before - if that's possible.  But I'm still in the dumps over the diabetes, regardless of the fact it could just be gestational.  Trying to get my damned blood sugars down is a PITA.

Last night I had a reading of 5.6 before bed, but when I woke up this morning and took my morning one, it was 6.8 (should be below 5).

I had brekky, and then did a shitload of washing and hanging the clothes out.  Then after two hours took the blood test, and it wasn't too bad, being below 6.  Had lunch late because I had dragged the kids into the lounge and started spring cleaning (never mind that it's autumn) - and almost finished that room.  Did another blood test and it was low again - thank god - but it was 45 minutes late.

I'm trying my best here, but am feeling like my throats been cut for most of the time.  Two slices of bread and salad just doesn't cut it for me.  Neither does plain porridge and a teaspoon of honey for brekky - but atleast it keeping the sugar level down.  I haven't been online in almost a week now, but tomorrow night will come on and do some research into GI - the book I have only covers a little bit of what I need.

Dinner time is good though, cos I can bulk up on vegies and a little meat, though not so much spud.  At least I feel satiated after the evening meal.  

I need to be more active - despite being told I need to rest.  I find my metabolism is none existant - or so low it feels as if it doesn't exist.  Doesn't seem to matter what I have to eat, it burns off so slow you'd think I was trying to set fire to water. :o\

Anyway - enough bitching for now.  It's late and I have to motivate the kids fo the remainder of the house cleaning tomorrow.  Yipppeeeeee!!!!!  *drips sarcasm*

I wasn't going to ask - though I suspected I was going to test positive, after feeling dry as buggery after drinking the gunk they give you - but Mark asked the doc what the reading was.  So I am def higher than normal.  Mark's good readings are between 4 - 11, 11 being the worst....and I'm over that. :o\

Would explain the constant peeing - and drinking etc.  but I thought - sionce it had been 4 weeks since th last test, that I was fine, but I was an <b>oversight</b> apparently.

Also now measuring 36 instead of 32 on the fundal height.  This is attributed to Cailee being a little larger than she should be thanks to the diabetes.  Blood pressure was up too. 155/95 from 145/85... wonderful - NOT!

Well I suppose I should be grateful that Mel chose to talk to my stomach and not to the baby via my ear again....

Went for a lie down yesterday arvo before Mark came home.  A 6am start just didn't agree with me, and by 3.30pm yesterday I was knackered.  But I should have chosen an earlier time to hit the sack so that I could have been asleep when the girls got home from school - I may have had a chance of a nap then, instead...

Whenever I am in the prone position these days, the girls (and Bobbie occasionally) hover over me, anxious to feel Cailee kicking.  Yesterday afternoon was no exception.  I lay down and instantly Mel was there, trying to feel her little sister moving around.  When Cailee wouldn't accommodate, Mel decided to wake her.

A B C D E F G - H I J K LMNOP - Q R S - T U V - W X - Y and Z  etc, over and <b>over</b> again.

I finally got sick of the repeats - you know the old song - <i>""This is the song that has no end, it just goes round and round again""</i> - Sherie and Lambchop sang it I think?  That's what the ABC was like for me yesterday.  

So I said to Mel, how about teaching her to spell, instead?  So for the next half hour between her and AImee they taught Cailee the basic three letter words:  C A T spells CAT - kuh-ah-tuh...  D O G spells DOG - duh-o-guh.

Well it is my own fault....I did tell them I didn't want anyone ""baby talking"" to their sister.  No one was permitted to baby talk any of my kids - I figured you could talk normal words, and still sound goofy enough to raise a smile from any baby - and still maintain it.  My kids all developed well despite my pedantic ways, and all have pretty good vocabs, so I must have done something right - right?

Melanie - at two and a half could carry on a perfectly understandable conversation with correct word usage, so much so that I had comments on her speech.  And Aimee was talking in complete sentences by 16 months old.  To see the look on adult faces when talking to her, was priceless.  They'd talk down to her, and she would talk properly to them in return with no baby-ish mistakes.  So hopefully I can do the same with Cailee.  

Then again - all my kids inherited my gift of the gab...

On another note, however, my gums are still sore.  And I still have the deep holes where the roots were, they haven't even started to heal over.  I may have to go back to the dentist later in the week if it still hasn't begun to heal. *sighs*"

This past few weeks and old friend from Pizza Hut has been visiting weekly.  Mark and he get along fantastically and have a similar sense of humour (the ridiculous?) so its been a riot on the nights he calls around.  Anyway on Friday night he came around for dinner as well as the company, and asked if he could cook tea for us on Sunday night?  This was a sort of 'thank you' apparently.  He's been having a rough time of it since his missus kicked him out in favour of another fella. :o\

I jumped at the chance of someone else cooking - naturally.

I've never been one to eat parmagiana, mainly because I hate the whole way veal is reared.  Dad once researched it for the farm, and after reading the inhumane conditions, it put me off for life.  But apparently not all parmagiana is veal - news to me.

Russ came around and cooked us all chicken parmagiana (and yes it was free range chicken! LOL) and I loved it!!!!  *drools*  I could have eaten two of them!  Is it possible to be in lust with food?  (For perfectly innocent uses!!)

As you can see I'm in a happier frame of mind (and body) since the last post.

<b>Finally</b> got my tooth yanked out yesterday, and despite the worry over how much pain I'd be in, I am feeling really <b>really</b> good!

When I first laid eyes on the dentist I was a little concerned that she'd be able to extract the tooth, she was so tiny and I thought - there's no way this woman can yank a tooth, but she surprised me on more than one count.

She was really gentle with the injection, and all I felt was a pin prick.  She had hidden muscles int hose tiny arms of hers too, coz within 10 mins of having the injection the tooth was out.  The top of my jaw (hinge) is still sore, but other than that I am finally pain free after a week and a day!!

The gyno told her she could take an xray provided I was well covered, and Cailee is still kicking so neither the xray or the injection had an adverse effect - *gives HUGE sigh of relief!*

The swelling from the past couple of weeks seems to have dissipated now as well, so last night I removed all my rings from my fingers while I still can.  Hands look really bare at the moment, and with the psorasis disappearing during pregnancy my hands don't look like mine at the moment. LOL

Anyway just thought I'd make an update here and thank Dr Ong at the same time.

I went and added another $60 to the baby seat, so have less than $65 to pay on it now.  I also found somewhere that sells 'snibs' so I can pack them away for when Cailee arrives, now all I have to do is find someplace that sells the cloth nappies, not the towelling ones.  Cloth seems harder to find these days, as you can buy the towelling ones anywhere. :o\

Have almost everything I need now, just need a couple of pairs of tracky pants and a couple of button up tops so I can use them in the hospital and after, for breastfeeding.

Well after being knocked back by three dentists because I am pregnant, I ended up in tears to the ObGyn because no one was willing to touch me.  He was totally pissed that they would recommend I spend the next 10 weeks in pain and risk infection to Cailee, and told me the next one who raised objections should call him.

Well I rang another and got the same run around, and was running out of dentists in the local area.  I ended up calling the one I went to last time, but even they can't fit me in until tomorrow - but I have an appt for 3pm.  So only another 24+hours until I can be fixed.

The only good thing about this practice is they will already have xrays from previous work on that side of the jaw, so should be able to check whether or not the root system is all screwy like the last tooth was, and hopefully not need more xrays.  Doug (ObGyn) said that small xrays of the jaw should be ok, but they'll need a special local anaesthetic and certain antibiotics, if required.  But I just wanna be pain free.  

The Clove Oil is helping a little, but I'm once again doped to the eyeballs with panadein forte, this is only the third tablet I've had in five days so hopefully I'm not overindulging Cailee.  Doug's partner told me I could take them sparingly for migraines, which I haven't done in months, and I've only used 6 in the past 8 days, either going without, or settling for the milder forms, but right now it hurts so much I can't just rely on the panadol.

Am gonna head back to bed I think and wait for the panadein to start knocking me out."

But before the pregnant memory kicks in I just had to add....

Tomorro night on Today/Tonight (a current affairs show) they are havign a segment on Domestic Blindness.  Everyone seems to suffer from it in some form or another - I'm not alone!!  You know the drill - ""Has anyone seen my car keys?""  ""Where's my bloody purse?""  ""I know I left my glasses here, but they've gone!""  That sort of thing.  Along with the pregnant memory syndrome I'm going through, I suffer chronically from DB, and Mark said I <b>have</b> to watch this show.

I jokingly turned to him and said ""Have you seen the baby anywhere?""  Well, he carried it a little further after rolling his eyes at me.  

""Yeah, I can just imagine you, 'Ok! Who's hidden the nappy wipes?'""  

""Or, 'Where've the flaming nappy pins gone?""  

""Where's the babies bottle?""  

On that one I piped up - ""No!  I'm feeding her myself for the first six to twelve months, so we won't have that problem.""  

""Ok - 'Where's my bloody boob gone?  It was there this morning when I looked in the mirror!'""

Sorry - but I just had to include that in LJ, as I was in stitches when he started.  So much so, that I ended up with tears in my eyes and choking on laughter.

It will be interesting watching the segment tomorrow night though, and seeing just how blind some people can be - the segment is supposed to help with curing DB, so we'll see."

Was sitting watchig Rove Live on telly last night, and Blink 182 came on to play live.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not so old that I don't appreciate some of their music, one or two songs, I've even been known to sing along to.  But last night - live - they sounded crap.  And Cailee must have thought so as well, unless.... horror of horror's she <b>liked</b> them???

She'd been relatively quite most of the night, but when they started singing she was all over the place, kicking here, there and everywhere.  I <b>choose</b> to believe she was telling me to use the mute button, but Melanie reckons she was dancing. *sighs*

This last coupel of days my stomach seems to have had a mind of it's own.  All of a sudden it's popped out further than my boobs, and I actually look pregnant.  The girls keep coming up to me and talking to Cailee coz she really is visible there now.  And Bobbie... well he's gonna be a caution for Cailee to watch out for when she's a teenager.  

He's already teasing her and she hasn't even made an appearance yet!  Goodness knows what he'll be like when she's in her teens?  There's an almost 12 year diff in their ages, so I can just imagine big brother coming home to visit and teasing the hell out of her and her complaining that he's being a PITA - similar to what  go through with Bobbie and Aimee right now. LOL

I still haven't been tot he dentist, that's tomorrow when I have the cash.  So I'm still living on paracetamol and bonjela to ease the pain, but last night I began fiddling with the tooth and jiggled it about a little bit and the pain disappeared for long enough that I could fall asleep.

Have been living on packet pasta for the last couple of days, but thank god by this time tomorrow I could be sitting in a dentist chair. I hope so anyway.

Spent half the weekened doped up and the remainder asleep trying to avoid pain.  I really need to go to the dentist, but don't know whether he'll do anything for me or not.  And until later in the week I don't have the cash for an appointment anyway so the point is mute.  *shrugs*

Mel and Aimee are sitting here trying to come up with games for the guests to play, as well as organise the guest list.

It's pretty sad really, when its all written down to see that apart from rellies, I have only four friends names on the list - if it were invites for friends online as well the guest list would be triple the size.  Guess that's what happens when you become a semi recluse. :o\

But mel still has about 22 or so guests to send invites to.  Some are friends of hers, and their mums who I talk to occassionally, so the list has grown a little from just mum, m-i-l, and the sisters in law en-masse.

Now we're having discussions on what type of invitation they should send?  I never had this with any of the three older kids, baby showers have only become vogue in the past few years over here.  But it makes the girls feel better being more involved and despite their differing ideas, it should be a fun afternoon."

I ate a bacon bread roll about 20 mins ago, and its gone in between my teeth and latched onto a nerve.  Argggghhh.  I searched the house for the bonjela, a local anaesthetic that babies have when they're teething, and am hoping it will kick in <b>soon</b>.  I have crappy gums, and all my teeth are normally loose anyway, the dentist says eventually I'll have to have dentures :o(, but for now, am living day to day with this, but *whines* it hurts and there's nothing that can be done for this right now.  Even the stronger paracetamol the doc prescribed isn't working.

I had my diabetes check today. 450ml of that yucky sugary sweet syrup and then waiting for an hour before a blood test.  I have a sneaking suspicion they're gonna find its positive for gestational diabetes cos even Mark commented on how often I'm running to the toot, and the amount of fluids I seem to be drinking.

All through the hour at the hospital, I had to keep trying to build up some moisture in my mouth - can't be a good sign.

Anyway I won't find out until at least Saturday what the blood results are, so if all else fails, and I'll feeling mega dry later today, I'll get Mark to do a quick blood test on his monitor and see what the result is.

"event","Ok, I need to get the anger out first coz it wasn't even my fault this time and I still ended up wearing the crap!

<lj-cut text=""TMI"">
I hadn't had a PAP smear in almost five years, until last November at my first or second Gyno appointment.  As with most women, I hate the indignity of it above all; but, with the Gyno having a bed that is no more than a foot and a half wide, the experience is fraught with danger as well.  Vinyl covered in paper does not make for a safe place to try and manoeuvre.

So I go in for a normal check up yesterday only to find that the smear I had in November was ruined for some reason, and I'd have to have another one. :o(  I was not a happy chappy.

I'll skip ahead here for a moment too: It was only on leaving the doc's room, that his receptionist, taking the utmost care with the new smear, informed me that she 'had to be careful' as she dropped one the other day and might have messed it up!!!!!!  

So some other poor woman is going to go back to the Gyno's in another month or so to find that she too, has to jump back on to the table for another undignified experience.  *grrrrrrr* 

Anyway, while there yesterday I mentioned the lower bowel pain I've been having, and you can imagine what else I had.  He couldn't find anything wrong there either, so I just have to live with this 'pole sitting' until it leaves me.  He also checked the cervix during the smear test, and said it looks healthy and nicely tight, some good news - finally!

He then did the fundus height check, and this is where I'm a little puzzled and wonder if anyone else has had the same thing happen, and what the outcome was?

When reading through pregnancy sites and all the pregnancy books I Have at home, it says that usually the fundal height matches with the gestation dates, right?  I know it did with all three of my other children, however, yesterday instead of measuring 28"" for the 28 weeks, I was measuring 31"".  Has anyone else measured so far off what they should have? And if so, how many have gone into labour early?  

I didn't see what he'd written until I got home, but it may explain his reticence in discussing induction; despite him saying he'd have no problem with it coz it's only 3 or four days earlier than I'm due.

He said he'd have no problems inducing me a little early, but that may be we should leave it another few weeks to discuss, and see what happens.

So did anyone else have differing heights with their gestation period, and if so, did you end up going early or did you go dd or over?  There is only one baby - we know this for sure.  And he won't give me another scan even if I asked for one, as I've had four so far with diff problems and I wouldn't ask for another unless there was a damned good reason - I don't want the chance of any damage from over scanning.

</lj-cut>

In other news - he apologised to me for not sending me for the gestational diabetes check over the last month too.  His midwife reminded him and so this week I get to drink the yucky stuff. *blech*

Weight has gone up again - so I'm now officially the size of a baby elephant. :o(

That's all for now, though you've prolly fallen asleep by now anyway. LOL

"event","Have been feeling like crap all day today.  The pain I had yesterday still hasn't abated, but now Cailee seems to have dropped lower which isn't right for only 28 weeks.  I have felt her down in the lower pelvis all day today, and after dinner tonight she gave me a couple of <b>really</b> painful kicks in the lower pelvis that felt like she was trying to escape.

Later this evening I started getting really strong Braxton-Hicks contractions, so I'm really grateful that I'm going to the gyno tomorrow.  Even from the side view you can see that the ""bump"" has dropped a fair bit.  I'm just hoping that during the night these bloody contractions stop and that she moved back up into the mid-region again.

Getting up off the couch or sitting down on any chair - I am soooooo tender.

We got the bookcase moved from beside my bed today (or rather Mark and Aimee did) so the bassinette can go in tomorrow after I tidy up and vaccuum.

Finally got the car seat on layby, so I'll have that paid off in about 5 weeks.  According to my calendar I have 82 days to go now - will see what the doc thinks tomorrow. 

Aimee sorted through the baby clothes we have here today, and put them in one of her bedside tables until we figure out what we'll do as far as where the girls will be sleeping.  

We discussed taking our old bedroom back once Cailee goes into the cot, as Mel and Aimee, although they really need the bigger bedroom, will also need peace and quiet towards the end of the year (especially Mel with exams in November) and having a baby in the room with them could prove a hazard to study.

I really think that by that time, we'll be looking at a caravan or something in the back garden for Melanie though.  She wouldn't mind in the least, but we'll have to look at finances and see where we stand.

I also finished organising Cailee's webpage but it won't go live until after the birth, though I did change the backgrounds and stuff on my personal view for this LJ.  It's cute - but very pink!  Can't wait to show Mel, she hates pink - though she did say she liked the webpage layout.  I actually went with someone elses graphics for a change instead of making my own but I think they look pretty and definitely girly. LOL

Anyway I'd best go make Mark's lunch and get to bed and see if these damned Braxton-Hicks go."

Don't know if it was the anchovies I had on the pizza last night, or whether it's just that Cailee has slipped lower into the pelvis again, but this morning I was woken by chronic pain down the side of the abdomen and into the bowels again.  Excruciating pain, and even now two hours later, it still hurts down below.  But I doubt going to the hospital again will help, as last time I was just prescribed laxettes. *shrugs*

Will see how it goes for the remainder of the day, if I'm still no good by tomorrow I'll have no choice but to call the gyno again.  Cailee is still moving, so I know she's ok.

In other news, I'm now stressing about the real trip to the hospital when in labour, and praying to the almighty that I don't end up having to travel to the hospital between 3pm and 4.30pm during the week.  Our local council in their infinite wisdom put in the second of two ring roads, last year.  This second one crosses both entrances to the hospital as well as to the nearby doctors surgery.  There is a bottle neck of two roads merging into one as you try to access either the hospital or doctors, and yesterday when having to take Melanie for a check up at the doc's we arrived just in timne for all the kids to be leaving the local school and all the parents to be using the ring road to collect their children.

Melanie had to get out of the car and walk the last 200 metres to the doctors office and it took me more than 20 minutes to get onto the road that passes the entrance to the hospital and the doc's.  The only other entrance to the hospital is off Main Street.  I figured, well we just won't go via Vale Street to get to the hospital.  But when I finally got onto Main Street there was a traffic jam right up to Hampden Street which is about 500 metres further up from the hospital entrance.  So if I go into labour and have to get to the hospital anytime between 3.00pm and 4.30pm - I'm stuffed.  I'll have to walk atleast 200 - 300 metres if I leave Mark and the kids in the car.  Oh joy! Oh rapture!

Thanks Mornington Council - you made it so much easier for people to access the local hospital - NOT!"

Felt wonderful after the shower, no itchiness in the throat for a full 15 mins.  But once out - the sneezing starts again. *sighs...& ...sneezes*

But to get back to the topic above....

Mother and father in law came around last night - they've been away for a week and I haven't seen them in two ... MIL's comment when she saw me..  ""You're beginning to show."" 

According to the rest of the family, I've been showing for a few weeks now.  But that wasn't the main reason I know I'm expanding.

Does anyone else have a shower door that slides in three seperate panes?  

We do :o(  

And to my horror I realised today that if I grow much more, I'll be going around to my mums place to shower each day.  Because of the expanding belly, I can't slip as easily through the door sideways anymore.  And because of a certain ex-boyfriend - my 'childbearing hips' won't let me pass either. (Well that's my take on the whole thing - it's easier to blame him, not my love of chips, peanuts etc etc)

I was using my tongue to try and abrade the itchiness in my throat, because once it gets to a really bad stage, the sneezing starts again.

Last week hubby sank into a deep depression.  With his 40th birthday pending and the baby on the way, he wasn't too impressed with life.  I'd been pretty fair with him though, usually I rub it in badly that he turns another year older 7 months and 1 day before me, this year, sensing his depressed state, I didn't say a word.

We had his party yesterday and tonight before he went to bed he actually came up, gave me a hug and a kiss and thanked me for making his day a bit better, also for throwing the party for him.  He gave the kids all a big hug and kiss each and thanked them as well - finally realising that the big <b> 4 0 </b> is just a number.

He survived and so did we! LOL

Though I must admit to being more than a little emotional tonight, anyway.  I'd just given hubby and son a hair trim before they went to bed. Father and son sat and watched the tv together for a few mins before heading off to sleep, both sitting opposite, but in profile to me - I looked up at the pair of them, and all of a sudden my heart skipped a beat.  Don't ask me why, but the only thought I had was, 'these guys are <b>my</b> boys and I love them to death' and I had a lump in my throat.  So when hubby came up to thank me while I was collecting the dishes to put in the dishwasher, I had a hard time trying not to cry.

Gotta love them pregnancy hormones! LOL

In other news, my neighbour went in four weeks early yesterday morning and gave birth to her fourth child, a little boy.  Word was that they would call their baby Oscar, but when her daughter told us yesterday about the birth, she said they hadn't decided on a name yet, so I'm waiting to find out.

Sister in law, Wendy, is doing okay so far with her pregnancy, too.  She's still getting yukky morning sickness, but other than that she has safely passed her 13th week and is looking healthier.  We are both seeing ObGyn's in the same practice, so as my visits go to fortnightly we'll be playing catch up in the waiting room.  

27 weeks today and my next appointment is next week.  I have to remember to ask about the oedema I've been getting in my feet and ankles, despite sitting for most of the day with my feet up.  And also have to ask whether he has any objections to an induction if Cailee doesn't show up by the 21st May. 

I know I'm not due until the 25th, but with Mel sitting exams for the two weeks around when Cailee is due, I want her to be able to sit and concentrate as much as possible and not worry that she's going to get a phone call mid exam telling her she is being collected to be taken to the hospital.

Her teacher has said not to worry about missing an exam here or there, but because Mel has a habit of going blank during tests and stuff, she needs all the practice she can get at trying to remain calm while doing an exam of any type.  Hopefully Dr J, will be agreeable.  

Mark can't change his holidays either, so I don't want to go over by too much, otherwise he'll be goign back to work before I come home from the hopsital.  We want to have sometime together with just him, me and Cailee while the other kids are at school, so that's reason #2.

And the last excuse I have, I'd love for Cailee to be born on the 22nd, as its my grandmothers birthday.  Gran is the only one of that generation left alive, and even though she has dementia and wouldn't understand, I'd still like Cailee to have some connection to her.  Aimee was born on my grandfathers birthday and actually got to spend her 2nd birthday in the UK with grandad before he died.  Cailee won't have that chance, but it'd still be nice.

I don't want to risk anything with Cailee, but I still think I'm a week or so ahead of the due dates I've been given.  Who knows, all of the excuses/reasons/wishes I have above might be negated by her earlier arrival anyway.


Now that the dryer has finished, I might head off to bed. With the party this weekend all the washing has been left until the last minute - but what else is new anyway?  It's school uniforms as usual."

After not feeling her kick for the last 24 hours or so, and then reading one of the threads in <lj user=""babies2004""> I panicked a bit, but today, she's being going nuts.  Well, she's been kicking again since I ate my toast, so I feel a little better now.

I'm having to move further away from the computer desk now, which means my already rotund abdomen is getting to be more so.

Am still feeling fine, though the weekend was a worry with the migraine. I wonder if they've ever done studies on the effects of migraines on babies in utero?  Maybe that would explain why she's been so quiet the last day or so?

Hvae to start looking for specials on baby car seats again and mid next month I have to make sure my bags are packed and ready to go to the hopsital just on the offchance I end up going in early.  Not much chance of that, but you know how it goes, when you're not prepared, then something happens.

Now I keep wondering who the baby will look more like.  Bobbie took after Mel in looks, and both took after Mark.  Then when Aimee was born, for the first couple of hours, she looked like my dad - at least when she frowned - then developed Mark's mum's looks.

Just once I'd like one of my children to take after my side, but when I look at Guy and Paul's children, it seems my family is only supplying the necessary genes to create a child.  As Guy's two kids look like Debbie's family and Paul's little boy looks like Wendy's brother. 

*sighs* 

So prolly no chance.

Ah well, as long as she's healthy and remains that way, I'll be happy.  Who'd'a thunk I'd be so clucky????

Everything is going swimmingly, he was really pleased with the report from the ultrasound I had two days before Christmas, and entered the added info of the baby being a girl into his records - that hadn't been supplied in the report from the scan.

Cailee is becoming more active, last night Mark actually felt her kicking - so he's become more clucky too.

I've been almost totally smoke free since four days before Christmas now.  I say almost because we both slipped on NYE and had a couple of smokes, but I also slipped Jan 2 as well and pinched a smoke off a friend.  But since then nothing, and I haven't been on the patches since Jan 2 either, so both hubby and the doc are really pleased with me, and I know Cailee'll be better off for it too.

Doesn't mean I couldn't quite easily take up smoking again, wonder if I'll ever get over it?  Every now and then I stop what I'm doing and my brain tells me I need something - just can't remember what.  Then I remember I need a smoke and have to hurriedly think of something else to take my mind off the cigarette. **sighs**

I have Cailee's scan on video and watch it every now and then, more for reassurance.  I can't believe that its got her heartbeat recorded as well!!!  When I got video's of Aimee and Bobbie scans they couldnt' record sound on the tape, but Cailee's is coming out loud and clear.  Just wish they'd been able to do video's when I was pregnant with Melanie, as she is the only one to miss out on having a pre-birth record. 

Flaming acid stomach's are giving me the pip right now though.  I was hoping Doug could give me a hint of some new medical marvel to clear away gastric reflux... *sighs* ... no such luck.  If Cailee follows with the way her sisters and brother were, then I'm about to give birth to a babboon.  I had so much heartburn with Melanie she had a full crop of black hair when she emerged.  Looks like Cailee'll be the same.

(would do cartwheels if I could)

We went to the doc's today for the 18 week scan and managed to get a video and still of the baby in-utero.  The kids were all ecstatic to both see and hear their new sibling.  Hubby and I were close to tears, on my part it was relief as I haven't felt any movement in weeks.  I was anxious to see the heartbeat!  But the baby is alive and well, and now we know the sex.....

"event","My memory is taking a fast dive at the moment.

We had to go around to mark's mum and dad's on the weekend, and I almost drove past the turnoff to their place.  I honestly had a pregnant pause when I couldn't' remember whether it was the right road I was turning down.   Wouldn't be so bad, but they actually live right off Main Street.  Mark looked at me sideways, asked what was wrong, and when I told him, he then looked at me as if I didn't belong behind the wheel of a vehicle.

I'm at the stage now where I thank the great Mobile Phone creators for their wisdom in including a Scheduler in the phones accessories.  Without it I wouldn't get very far.  All doc's appointments and anything important have to be entered or I <b>will</b> forget.  I can't remember being this forgetful with other pregnancies - then again, I just can't remember - period!

I'm currently in Week 15 of the pregnancy, though even that was debatable on Sunday evening, when I had problems with my counting as well as my memory.  To show you how bad I am really getting, this is someone who can remember things from when I was 3 years old and younger, and who can say, ""remember the time..."" and baffle whoever I'm talking to with how clear a memory I have.  My catch cry was always, ""Not only the size of an elephant - but with the memory to boot!""  This may give you a clue why Mark is becoming concerned.

Those little notes I used to hate waking up to, from the kids and Mark, 
<br><br><ul>
<li> ""Mum, please remember to phone ...""<br>
<li> ""K, don't forget to pay the....."" <br>
</ul><br><br>
are now my saving grace.

I had an earlier than usual trip to the Gyno yesterday.  Wasn't supposed to go until the 16th December, but I got a phone call last Thursday from the partner in the practice.  Doug was away for the week, and my blood work finally came back for the DS testing.  Dr H suggested I might want to discuss with Doug, amnio....

Dr H organized for an earlier appt, and yesterday Mark and I went back to discuss the fact my % had gone from 1/696 to 1/269 chances of having a DS child.  It would have been much easier to make the decision if Doug had come right out and said Yes or No, to my needing it, but like a good doc he gave me all the pro's and con's.  In desperation (sort of) I laid the decision at Mark's feet.  (A part of me wanted to have the test, but the larger part of me screamed NO!)

Mark and Doug discussed odds - as they bet more than I do on the horses. (Yeah I know, kinda stupid to think that way, but the old saying of ""If I was a betting man...."" doesn't work for me, as I rarely bet - once a year for the Melbourne Cup is my limit.)

I ended up asking Doug point blank, ""Do I need this test.""  Still didn't get a firm answer, but Mark said later, all he kept thinking was that if he had said yes, have the test, and the baby was healthy and yet I miscarried because of the test, he would never forgive himself. (I also think he was concerned that with that scenario I would never forgive him either.)  So we decided not to go through with the test.  Once the end of this week is over, I can't go back and change my decision.  So I just have to hold faith that God will bless the baby with health and well-being.

I did get a shock when Doug took my blood pressure and felt for the baby through my tummy.  Blood pressure had gone up - it had risen to 150/80.  But the real shock was when Doug palpated the stomach and felt the womb/fundus a lot higher than I thought it was.  He said the height is about 2 inches below my navel, whereas I thought it was still only just peeping above my pubic bone.

I have felt a light squirming in my abdomen off and on for about a week, though he said I shouldn't really be feeling anything right now.  But then agreed that because the placenta is posterior it could be possible.  I can feel a pressure on my bladder now every time I sit down at the computer desk, so I'm learning to lean back instead of forward and hunched over the keyboard.  I never did have good posture. LOL

I have a mild case of sciatica which is literally a PITA and leg and lower back....etc.

Am still feeling a little tired, and in the mornings, unless I have toast first thing, I feel nauseous.  Other than that, I am looking forward to when those light flutters become prods and pokes.  I'm nearing my favourite part of pregnancy - being able to actually feel the baby kicking - there's nothing like it!

The kids are all excited now as they get an early Christmas present!  We go for my next scan on the 23rd December, and by then the doc (Graham) should be able to tell me whether I'm having a boy or a girl - providing the baby wants to be cooperative and flash the scanner!"

"event","I don't know how long it has been when I watched Japanese drama. This season's drama has a lot to offer! There are about ten dramas that I'm interested in and I've already watched two first-episodes now, I like both. 

<lj-cut text=""Woot, I'm finally posting here lol"">First one is Tenchijin which will be the second taiga drama I'm watching; the first one was Atsuhime (Aoi Miyazaki and Eita - woot!) The casts in Tenchijin are pretty much <i>droolable</i> as well: Tsumabuki Satoshi, Kitamura Kazuki, Oguri Shun, Hiroshi Abe, Shirota Yu, Hiroshi Abe (and not exactly exciting for me; but Aibu Saki, Takako Tokiwa, Masami Nagasawa for the actresses) I think I'm going to enjoy this one a lot :)

The second one is TRIANGLE. Not exactly interested at first, because I dislike Inagaki Goro (specifically, his hair) but the story is too interesting to be ditched. Apparently, the first episode has left me (and others) hanging with a lot of twist in the story; which means I'll be following this drama as well :)

Other choices: 
- Voice (Eita, Ikuta Toma, Ishihara Satomi)
- Mei-chan no Shitsuji (Eikura Nana, Mizushima Hiro, Sato Takeru, Mukai Osamu, Yamada Yu - <i>wootness!</i>)
- Love Shuffle (Tamaki Hiroshi, Karina, Matsuda Shota, and special cast: DAIGO!)
- Kiina (Kanno Miho! - This is enough to make me want to watch it lol)
- Zeni Geba (Matsuyama Kenichi!!)
- Hissatsu Shigotonin 2009 (OHKURA)
- Uta no Oniisan (Not exactly interested, but casts are Ohno Satoshi, Maruyama Ryuuhei! Can't remember the others..)
- Naniwa no Hana (Kuriyama Chiaki, don't know who the guy is)</lj-cut>"

To Kanjani8 who have given their best in each and every show, Kansai Jrs who have followed 8 throughout Japan, Staff-san, Baku-san, and to all who have helped.. Otsukaresama deshita! 

Many things have happened during this 5 months; funny moments to touching moments, all are just memorable. And also, to fans who have went all the way to watch the shows, arigatou <3

Even though I didn't attend any of the shows, it was fun reading all the reports, listening to all the recordings and watching all the fancams :)

Kore kara mou ganbatte! atashitachi mou zutto ouenshitemasu kara! <3"

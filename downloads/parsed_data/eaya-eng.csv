"event","It's said that mathematics develops our brains, making the non-intelligent be rather-intelligent. Let them say so. The examinations of this period dislocated my brain, rotated it at 180 degrees and then shaked it, they put into my head the egg whisk and shaked my brain with the huge mixer, adding into that coctail some vanil parfum of mine and some differencial equestions for the poignancy. It's a strange period - examinations: it can make a rather-intelligent man be a neanderthal man even in several days, in spite of the centuries of pains of evolution. The brain is swelling like buds at the trees, and then it comes out becoming green leaves - it's rustling somewhere in my head and luring the wind by its youth. There is only the wind behind those sticky leaves, only the wind.."

"event","It seems to me it is a great day today. I have passed some tests today (oh God, thank you for the luck givven me today) and now i'm an owner of the access to pass the exam at differential equations. I have been strugling and fighting for it for a long time and now i have the permission. I only want to say some words about the symbolism of this event. So follow my thoughts.

Someone has no luck today, cause the whole luck i have pull onto my side like a huge <i>blanket</i> in winter. What have i done that i'm so lucky today to pull it from someone? It's strange how the world is made: i saw a little corner of an eider-down hanging down from somewhere (nothing more, only a little edge of it) and i only tuged it, i didn't do anything else! So the blanket of luck had fallen down at me and i could hide myself from exturnal world, i could hide myself in its softness and feel myself covered and impenetrable, selfassured and a little bit happier then other people! I have a luck blanket today. Maybe it's a bonus like the armour in different games? :)

But in the same moment someone was left of this blanket of luck, he kept lying on the bed without it, because i had pulled it for myself. What if he was cold of the air of the reality without its protection? And he wouldn't find out that person who had stolen it, he wouldn't be sure that it had happened by a pure acsident! But it's true: at one moment you have luck, but at the next one you haven't! Match point. I will be left of the blanket of luck too in several days. But before someone see the little corner of it hanging down from my bed, i will take pleasure of life!

Now i have the whole huge eider-down of luck that i can share with my friends. It's even too big for me! Take some parts of it, i'm not grudging - with great pleasure! It meens that i have halped my friends to pass some tests with me and to get the access to examinations too. Oh, how happy we are today!"

Mirage is oppressing everyone, disgusting mirage is trickling down the forehead by the drops of sweat, there are little drops on the back under the t-shirts. And it's so quite: everyone has been melt, has stream down like a liquid paste onto the asphalt, spread like spots of gaz on the roads under the wheels of cars and buses. It's too hot here! It seems to me that i hate this summer whitch i have been waiting for so long! The city, transport, opened windows... Everythig is an another world for me, i'm not here like i'm dreaming.

"event","I've passed the next examination today, it's programming. Correctly speaking, it's a credit but i see no differ between them. I have all of the answers written down (i have been writing them all night long!) and i've used them, but in any case i wouldn't have had the highest mark.. I hate the theory, because i can't imaging what can be theory of programming. What is it? What do i need it for? Noncense. I can program but i don't know the theory at all so i have good mark and that has made me so sad and i have just had a terrible breakdown, as it was last night.

After that i've written the test at theory of the complex variable functions. Fucking functions! What a mess, i passed three tests at one day and one examinations at the same day! Why should i do it!? They are all crazy who thinks that it's ok for my brains, but it isn't, i'm going mad, but i'm still alright and keep on learning. Fucking examinations..

Now i'm very-very nervouse and tired, so i'm planing to go to sleep till the night coms down and then i'll stark to learn differential equestions. O my God, how i'm tired!"

Tonight i noticed that i'm going mad because of computer's sound! I felt i hated it and i had never felt it before cause the great part of my life was here, at the computer. There are all my novels and stories, and fairy tail and more, and more, all my photos are on the hard drive and disks. I have computerization but i can't live without it - it is the main idea."

There were several stupid themes about human-like robots, computer history, hardwear and sofwear, maybe something else but i'm not sure now. I was very surprised when i understood that i felt nothing when i had got the highest mark. I wasn't happy or proud for it, i really felt nothing. It's sad, it is very sad, but what can i do to make myself feel something linked with the university? Nothing. I wasn't even worry about that exam and that isn't because i was ready for it, no, i wasn't cause i had something else to do yesterday, the rison is different. Even looking at my groupmates before english afraid of it i felt nothing. I'm wondering why so. I think, i have to sleep more then an hour per day, it will help me, sure. But now i still don't care about it.

ps: i have found Christine's e-mail in her letter and decoded it tonight, so i hope i've understood all the letters in it correct cause i want to connect with her in the nearest time. it will be really great, i think, but let's see."

"event","I didn't sleep at all yesterday because i had to design a program, not rather difficult but there were some nuanses in it. I was so happy when i had finished so i didn't think about the time, i went to bed and in several minutes my phone started ringing asking me if i mind to wake up. I hate such mornings like it was yesterday! I was able to start to hate the whole world from earth to sky, including people and all things made by them. I desided to sleep a little bit and to go to the university two hours later, and i would come there but for terrible traffic jams because of The Last Bell Day.

25 of may is an official day of pupils who leave the school, refers to us The Last Bell Day. All the graduates who have become adults this day should wear casual cloths and red ribbons with little golden bells at their white shirts as badges. So all cities and towns here have been jingling and rustling all day long, and i only can imaging what surprises the night has prepared for us. My good friend who is leaving school today has told me a story, so let me tratslate it in english now.

One day when she was a little girl she saw a great number of baloons of different colors rasing up to the sky. It was so beautiful, so unusual, just like in her childish dreams! That day seemed to be very special, peculiar, super fresh, and the feeling of happyness didn't leave her till even the night came down. Then she opened the window and went to bed, trying to fall asleep. The pictures of that day were in her head and it was so difficult to leave theme and to go to other worlds of night dreams! She was lying and thinking of it when she heard a strange sound of smashing glass. It was a broken bottle... She asked her mom what was it and mom answered that young people had had a very light holiday that day, and the night was their and everything is permissible to them. What a strange day' she thought and fall asleep.

That is the story. And my friend ask me to listen to the sounds of the bells - there was her bell jingling too, she asked me to look up to the sky to the multicolored baloons - there was her baloon too. She also said that when they drank in the street and listen to someone playing the guitar, one little girl would hear their voices and the sounds of smashing bottles. It's indescribable... When i had done that, i felt a terrible bitter sadness inside, then i understood that i had had the same day two long years ago and i would never feel it again, i would never feel in the same way, never. I'm just an adult now, fucking long nineteen years and i feel being an adult and having done nothing. Gorkiy is totally right that Russians are born being already old men."

"event","I've been sleeping for about two hours only tonight, so i've woken up feeling so broken, i think i'm going to cross a threshold of my next spring depression. Oh my! To tell the true, it wasn't a very difficult day, but it was so nervouse! Everyone has gone mad in the university, because the most difficult time has come: the term is over, so the examinations are to be passed in a week. When i come home, i was so tired, i don't even know why, but i felt a terrible fatigue. I was ready to drop, i really could fall down on my bed and cry for hours, i lost courage. Thanks God, i din't lose my temper, i din't let myself to go to bed, i started to do stupid things such as taking photos of of my music center, typing stupid posts here and in my russian journal, net serfing and so on. It realy helps! Now i feel much better cause i've found a new entertainment - writing here in english, but i don't think it's a very good idea! I'd like to say, it's so unusual to think in english. But let's see, let's see.

Now there is a lot of work for me to do: i have to write a programm at geophysics and also i have to do my homework for differencial equestions and much, much more. I don't know if i need it and, nevertheless, if i need, what for, but there is no way out! I have arrived at an idea that i want to change my university, because mathematics is not for me, also i don't really like other subjects and people in my group, i don't really like to contact with my teachers, so i don't like this institution at all! But where can i go? I love programming but i don't like to paint with the help of OpenGL, it's so stupid and not required. I like creating different projects but i can't work under them now cause i have much to do in the university. So, what can i do? There's no other way out.

It's so strage for me to write about ordinary, routine events because my russian livejournal is full of different stories, fantastic dreams and other fairy tails, that i have seen in my sleep. Yeah, some of them are real and they have taken place, but i can write about them so beautiful in russian, i can exclude platitude and banality from the reality. An unfornunately, i can't do it in english not for a while yet. So langauge barrier is quite high for me now."

...
Fuck, i'm just kiddin! So, i've desided to create an english journal. I don't really know exactly the reasons of that desision, but i think it will be possible to connect with people who don't speak russian, and maybe it will be a very good practice for my english. I hope, i will write here as honestly as in Russian. But the time has to pass before i will be able to write as fast and beautiful as in my native language."

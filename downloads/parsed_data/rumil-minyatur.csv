Yes my journal is friends only ( a few months ago there was a situation which meant it had to be. . . and now even though it no longer has to be I've decided I quitel ike it this way) I will talk to pretty much anyone who deems to talk to me, so feel free. Buuuuuuuut. . . .

<b>1.</b> If you're going to add me make sure you comment.
<b>2.</b> You've got no chance if you're an annoying, squealing fangirl. You will only piss me off. I will end up wanting to throttle you, and that's no fun for either party.
<b>3.</b> You've also got no chance if you tYpE LiEk Dis all the time. A little bit of text language I can probably handle. Mixing up capitals and normal letters? Why? Just why?
<b>4.</b>If you want to add me please make sure we have something in common. Or make sure you know me from somewhere. There's no point in a random add just to boost your flist.
<b>5.</b> Please don't insult me/my friends/my interests. There's no reason to.
<b>6.</b> If you're going to add me, please comment, at least occassionally. Not only am I liable to forget you exist otherwise, but what's the point? Really?


That's all for now.

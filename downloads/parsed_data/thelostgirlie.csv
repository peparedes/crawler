"event","Ok, so today was senior emo day, and I have got to say that my outfit rocked. See, it actually looked like I pulled my outfit out of a scene kid's closet, not a goth's (which of course half of my grade doesn't know the difference between the two. Yeah some of them were wearing very goth like clothes, and what was worse was the fact that they could tell the difference between death metal, punk rock, alternative and emo music. Seriously. And of course all of the music they played was very main stream. Look, if you are going to make fun of the stereotype, then at least bring up some underground music). Plus, somehow I am amazingly good at acting depressed. I was seriously asked at least 10 times whether or not I was ""feeling ok."" Some people even said that my sadness was making them depressed. I love that feeling. Today in general was great."

"event","So this weekend I went to Mo Ranch, and I have to say that I had a decent time. I got to hang out with my really good guy friends and then have girl talk with some of the juniors, sam and ali. I can even say that the Mo-Down was fun. However, and that is an extremely emphasized however, the night of senior pranks/sneak-out was terrible.

First let me tell you that the supposed ""sneak-out"" wasn't even a real sneak-out. Every single chaperon knew when we were going to do it at 1 am, and even encouraged it. I know- weird! Whatever.

So then we decided that we needed to intimidate the freshmen and sophomores. We went into the freshman dorm quietly and on the count of three we started to scream ""Get on the damn floor, fish"" and flicker the lights. Half of them looked at us with unsure or upset faces, and the others scrambled to lie face down on the floor. I can admit that the scared freshmen made me quiet happy inside, but it was those that stood up and acted against us that troubled me. They yelled at us to ""get the fuck out!"" At that time the seniors felt it was time to go, before it really got ugly. But as we were leaving a girl came up to one of us and asked in a truly condescending voice ""Are you done yet?!"" So later the girls went back into there room and turn the air up to 99 degrees. I know that it was mean, but come on they were being hazed. They should have shown us more respect. We didn't actually hurt any of them, we just woke them up. Then we moved to the sophomores, who were a little more compliant so we left them alone after the initial hazing. (We also woke up the Junior guys, but it was crappily done)

Of course it was time to spell out the senior slogan, on the grass that is below the tall cat-walk (in case you don't know there is a tall cat-walk that goes across the camp, and below the cat walk is a large field of grass, where many leave messages that are formed by the placement of rocks in the shape of letter). To begin with we had a huge argument about what the rocks should say. Some said ""08, don't hate"", others ""08, master8"" (that is because we couldn't say masturbate), and still others said ""08, party late"". In the end, we ended up with ""08, party late"" (I wanted master8, but that was only because of the irony of being at a church based camp ground). So we went down below the cat-walk and began to argue once more on how to actually start the damn thing. Finally, a handful of people just decided to screw the rest of the group and start working (I was among that group). And it ended up that only that handful of people (it was only 10 of 30 or 40 seniors that worked. four of which were above us on the cat walk directing us were to put rocks, and the other six, including me, pulling out the tall grass and finding large rocks) actually completed the slogan, the rest of the people just stood around and bitched about stuff that was being done. Seriously the people that worked were the least bitchy, and we were doing the manual labor. I guess you can say that we worked well as a team. The rest of them just snipped at us, but we ignored ever word. Our logic was that if they were to actually do some manual labor, then they could have a say on how the words should be formed. In the end, we got fed up with the seniors that did nothing and basically said ""Fuck you!""

We finally finished at 3 o clock, with the all the labors having the sweaty and dirty bodies as proof of their work. Then, the girls that had been bitching at us for the past hour and a half, decided that we needed to have a ""group hug."" God, I think that every single one of the labors just wanted to get the hell out of there. So we went up to the cat-walk to admire our work, which I got to say was freaking awesome. But as I was walking up there I heard one of the bitchy slackers say ""Oh my god, we did so much work."" My blood boiled, and I seriously considered strangling that girl on the spot. I really don't think that those people deserved the credit, it should have only belonged to the 10 of us.

I finally decided to go to bed at 4 am after a well deserved shower. And got up drearily at 11 am, to get onto the bus where I fell back asleep on Aaron's (no, not Oni's) shoulder until we got back home.

I feel really sorry for you if you read my rant of doom. Seriously this was just a rant, a excessively angry rant, but a rant none the less. Maybe in a few day's I'll be over myself, but for now I am going to stay very angry (and possibly rant some more)."

Anywho, so I have realized that I don't enjoy watching the same shows as all of the kids my age. Shows like the OC, my super sweet sixteen, the real world, grey's anatomy, and lost just don't appeal to me. This I can understand, because I find that these shows are a waste of my time. But the weirdest thing about this sudden realization isn't about the shows that I hate, but in fact it is about the shows that I like. I have tendencies to watch old people shows. Things like the wheel of fortune, the price is right, and jeopardy. I truly do not understand myself."

"event","So recently I read this short story in Spanish class, and to be honest with you it was one of the weirdest things that I have ever read. It wasn't trippy or anything, it was just extremely boring. The story was called <u>El cuentecillo triste</u>, and I was about how this guy got bored on Sundays (really this is no joke). So the guy puts out an add to the newspaper for a girl to date. He even put the fact that he got bored on Sundays in the newspaper article. Then about a week later a girl replied to the article and the two went out on date, and to be truthful by the end of the story the two had fallen asleep in the movie theater because they got bored. 

     Then today I realized something, I am exactly like the guy. I have nothing to do and I am so freaking bored. Actually, I am bored out of my mind. I have not done a single thing that is productive this past weekend. I am almost mad at myself for being so lazy. *continuously smacks forehead* I...Must...Remember...That...Sloth...Is...BAD!!!

Okay at this point most people would say hey your lucky, you got to get away from your home and enjoy the sun. Then of course I would say yes I am indeed lucky, but there is some unfortunate things that happened on the trip. Of course my parents being the weird procrastinators that they are decided that we should not stay in orlando or tampa,&nbsp; but instead they chose a random sleepy town of ruskin to place our sorry little butts in. Also my brothers, who are whiny and quite annoying, decided that instead of doing something fun like I don't know going to universal studios or disney world we should go to spring training. Oh and I forgot to mention that the rental car we got was a town car, which means it had limited space. So lucky me I got to be squashed in between my two brothers everytime we went anywhere (and when I say anywhere I mean places that were at 2-3 hours away from ruskin). Luckily my parents decided against going to cape canveral, otherwise I would have been stuck in a car for 6 hours (and that is just going to the cape, then we would have to travel 6 hours back). Well at least I am home now. But this is why I hate family trips."

Actually I got to see call backs for most of the cast and I liked all of those who are the leading roles. My friend Marianne, who tried out for the witch, went up against a junior who was quite good, but in the end she lacked in facial expression for a witch (what I mean is her face was still too cute looking for a evil witch) and Marianne got the part.

"event","Well, if I could explain that trip in one word it was horrible. I knew that we shouldn't have taken that trip. Ok let me explain. We started our lovely drive to corpus cristi early in the morn. Every one was all grumpy, cause none of us are morning people. Especially my dad. My dad was in one of his moods, where if you say anything negative (i mean anything. like ""this hotdog tastes bad"") he will blow up and not talk to the negative speaking person for about a week. Normally he will only do it to the kids (aka me, and my two bros). But lately when he is a mood he has been taking it out on mom. In fact they have been getting into so many fights lately, but normally he will talk to her a few hours later. Now let us venture into the past to a time when I had no livejournal to vent to. This was a few months ago and one of the main reasons that I got this account to begin with.&nbsp;<br />
<div class=""ljcut"">I think it was april or march, but anyway one day my dad's fit of fury went further than ever before. I don't know what happened that day that made him so mad, but he was mad. I believe that my mom brought up some bad news to him (not saying that it was mildly bad news because it was very bad news), but apparently what happen is that when she said the news, my dad exploded (i wasn't there to witness it). My&nbsp; dad&nbsp; said that he was going to leave my mom, and as soon as he said that he took off in his car (don't know where he went and to this day I still don't).&nbsp; My mom came into my room <strike>crying&nbsp; </strike>bawling (i had never seen my mom cry, she is a very stoic person, and thus shows little emotion). She told me that my dad had taken off. That night I screamed into my pillow until I fell asleep.&nbsp; He eventually came back. Now back to the lovely future.&nbsp; As I said in the beginning my dad has these moods, and on the trip over my mom noticed. He shrugged it off saying it was nothing. Yet , later on in the trip, apparently their attorney called about who in hell knows what, and he talked to my mom. When my mom told my dad what the phone call was about&nbsp; he apparently got really irritated. Later they were resting in the hotel, my mom said that my dad broke into another argument.&nbsp; This time it was fierce, and my dad literally got up and walked out of the room.&nbsp; I didn't know what was going on cause I was in the other room reading a book while my bros were playing a game. But my mom came into the room, and said that he had left. She also said that we were to go back the next day, and that as soon as we were back my dad was going to go find an apartment. For the day all I could think about is their divorce. It was the worst feeling ever. And I know that I shouldn't hate my dad, but I don't&nbsp; know if I could forgive him. This time he made my brother cry (he like my mom show little emotion, in fact he shows none at all) along with my&nbsp; other brother (who cried the first time) and my mom.&nbsp; I didn't cry, until now as I am typing it all, but that is besides the point, because all I could do was hate. Look, I am not saying that my situation is as bad as it gets(cause it's not), but still I am very hurt.<br /></div>

"event","Right, so last week I went to Rockyvine. It's a retreat that my church has gone to for the past year.&nbsp; It is in Dutzow, Missouri (who thought of that name). Anyways alot happened, so much that I am not sure that I could type it all out. And it is not that anything that happened wasn't important, cause I certainly believe that they entire trip was important to me. But there will be this one part of the trip that sticks out to me the most. I was in mass and the priest was saying the homily. During our homily he decides to sing us a song rather than talk (cause he is just that cool). The Song is called <u>Find Your Wings</u> by Mark Harris. (This is the part where every thing gets confusing, so bare with me) In the middle of the song I started crying (they were silent teardrops). I don't know why, but I did (believe me I still don't know why, and I have listened to the song over a hundred times since I got home). So, mass went on, and my friends didn't notice. I stopped crying, and it was all good until the end of mass. I decided to stay in the church rather than go to lunch right away, to ask God why I was crying. As soon as I sat back down on the pew, I began to cry again. This time it was the wailish cry with all the extras that come along when you are crying. The priest had to come up to me twice just to make sure that I was okay. But in the middle of my cry fest, it just felt as if the hands of God were on my shoulders , because I felt this instant peace. It was a peace that I hadn't felt in a long time. (believe I haven't , it is because of the this lack of peace that I started this journal) All that has happened over the years, especially this year, was just washed away. I instantly got up, and left the church. I came upon the lunch hall, with my face still full of tears, and Chris S. walked out. He saw my face and he instantly pulled me into a hug. Of course, he had to inquire about what was going on. And I told that I had just spent the last twenty minutes in the church crying. All he did was cradle me and stroke my hair, telling me that it was okay. Okay so the video is not the real music video, but&nbsp; I could not find the real one (dude I would have prefered it over Naruto). Just listen to the song.<br /><span class=""ljvideo"">http://www.youtube.com/v/GDtSTr7Clkk</span>"

"event","Ok, so I just got back from a conference in Missouri. At 2:30 am. That was exciting, Not. Well, the retreat was allmax, but the trip from St. Louis to here was way to long.  I really enjoyed the retreat, it gave me alot of God time. I learned somethings about myself, and I am glad I did. Otherwise I would be in this constant mode of sadness. Anyway the retreat itself (worship, adoration and mass) is way to hard to explain in words. All I can say is that my God was present."

So, I finally managed to strike up the courage to email Sam. Now all I have to do is wait for an answer, if I get one. I hope I don't regret what I have just done. I hate being so old fashioned. Most of my friends would have already gone for him at least 3 1/2 years ago. Yet, I was bearly able to email him today. The good thing is, he probably won't read the email until way into the year (he has crappy internet). What scared me the most was actually copying the original letter into the email. I don't know why, but my heart felt like it was going a hundred miles per second. I'm scared.

We are going to go out and eat food (yay food!). Then of course we shall be venturing to my brother's baseball game. Go Westerhills Red!!! So, this past week I have been writing an email to Sam, telling him that I like him (THANK YOU KIM AND SAMANTHA FOR HELPING ME MOVE MY BUTT TO TALK TO HIM), but I never got around to sending it. The thing is I keep checking it for mistakes and stuff, plus I am really scared to tell him (I will be putting up the letter in here for only my friends to read). I was going to orginally going to email, because I didn't have his # to talk to him  personally. But guess what happened today, he texted me. So now i have his # but i am too afraid to use it. i hope that I will actually be able to email him the letter. Please, God, give me strength. I have never felt so much fear in my life.

I spent almost all the night crying, eating ice cream, and helping her out. She is in a lot of pain right now. Oh well, all I can do is pray for her. The rest of the weekend was spent doing absolutely nothing. But oh well. Oh goodness, I started thinking about Sam. Am I ever going to get over my crush and move on. He's my friend, and I don't want to lose that friendship. But I can't help liking him. He is one of the only guys, who doesn't hate me. I mean sure, I have other guy friends but it isn't the same with him. He is like my best friend. Dang it, why does my life sound like one of those cheesy soap operas.

So what my class and I end up doing is ""reviewing."" Well it really wasn't much of a review, because of all the yelling and screaming in the class. The teach that reviewed us had no control over the class. I mean she yelled at some people, so she didn't get respect from any of the students.  Oh well, I ended up putting down my head and nearly falling asleep. Then when my teach arrived. She took another 15 minutes to copy the test. Needless to say, it was a waste of time, but luckily the final only took 35 minutes to finish. I ended up watching some baseball game after the test, then I went home. What an exciting day in my life.

So, yeah today's summer school was one of those days that I didn't particularly enjoy. First, I had to take a quiz that I wasn't ready for, but luckily I actually pay attention in class so I think I passed. Then I had to present my alzheimer's disease project. O joy. It's not that the project isn't great, in fact it was awesome, (I am way to much of an overachiever, all of my class agrees. All I really needed to do is write a paper and show 1 or 2 pictures. Yet, I actually brought in a model of the brain to point out the places Alzheimer's affects; I brought in lots of pics and a video to get my point across.) but I hate speaking in front of people. Oh well, at least my class was astounded. Then I watched the baseball games going on in the field next to us. My friends were watching to, but they weren't watching the game if you catch my drift. It was indeed funny. At least my parents get back today.

TAKS are finally over. Let me put emphasis on the word FINALLY! Good God this week has been extremely boring. Do you not see this girls face she is so freakishly bored, and that is exactly how I felt. Well, at least I got started on my new story, but I don't know when I will start posting it. Maybe in the summer. If you want to read it go to quizilla.com. Anyways on to the rest of my day. I got to see some air force guys parchute in. They were supposed to give us the ""don't do drugs talk,"" but then it started raining. We didn't do anything for the rest of the day. Thank God. And that is pretty much it."

"event","I dunno whats been going on lately.  I dunno why people make me out to be the bad guy.  What have I done wrong?  I dont think that there is a soul on this planet that approves of my relationship with Danielle and it's not cuz we are both women, but something about me I guess.  My mom has issues and she says it's not Danielle, but me.  I know Danielle's father is telling her to watch out for me.  I know that early on in the relatioship, her mother even told her to becareful.  And even a few other people have had their input.  So will someone please tell me....  what's wrong with me??  I understand that Danielle has been hurt before.  And yes i know that she's a super sweet, caring, kind, and generous person.  But do people really think I would take advantage of that?  I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.  I've been in a relationship before where the other person just kept taking, taking, and taking.  I would never do that to someone.  And I give to Danielle as much as i can.  I'm sorry that I dont work at a prestigious job.  I'm sorry that I have to take more classes per day than Danielle does so I can't work as much.  I'm sorry that I can't transfer to Edinboro due to graduation requirements.  I'm sorry!  I'm sorry that I'm too quiet at times.  I'm sorry that I'm moody at times.  I'm sorry that I don't cry about every little thing that bothers me.  I'm sorry that I dont always talk about what bothers me.  I'm sorry that I'm not intimate enough.  I'm just sooooo fuckin sorry!  I dunno what else i can do.  I try so hard to be the best girlfriend and best friend I can be.  And if others can't see that or can't deal with it, then FUCK YOU!"

"event","Well, christine was home for the holidays.  WAS being the key word.  she left today around noon.  i got to spend some time with her and it was good.  i miss that girl sooo much sometimes and last night i found out that she's going to Afghanistan.  sometimes i hate the fact that shes in the airforce.  but at the same time, i'm glad she went in the military.  it gives her something to do, gives her some freedom but with restrictions at the same time, allows her to travel like she's always wanted and much much more.  shes a great gal and deserves great things.  i love her so much and just want the best for her.  infact, she's getting married.  her girlfriend asked her to marry her and then christine asked me to be in their wedding.  i'm so excited.  i think that the two of them will make a great couple.  last night christine had a little party like usual and while the her and chris2 were opening presents from the fam i just kept thinking about danielle and i.  about how i can't wait for the day when we can share things such as plates and silverware.  how we will get excited over sipmle gifts from the fam.  how we will be engaged and living together and doing things together like chris1 and chris2 are doing.  i almost started to cry.  the rest of the party was decent.  i did a shot with dad W.  i used the 99berries from last new years.  let me just say... AGHHHHHHHH!  it was old and disgusting.  made my stomach do flips.  but at the same time, it felt good to know that i can still handle shots considering i haven't truly done any in a long time.  and ya know what....  the shot didnt affect me at all.  not in the slightest.  ya know the best part of the night however wasnt the alcohol or gifts that christine got, but the little surprise i got from my best friend and my girl.  a surprise brithday cake.  they were soooo cute about it.  and chris2 helped out also.  it was great.  i almost cried for that too.  to have my girl and best friend together in the same place for my bday....  it was more than i could dream of!  i love the both of them with all of my heart.  what would i do without them.  especially danielle who thought of the whole idea.  she's amazing.  she never stops loving me no matter how moody i get.  and i thank her for that.  she's always putting up with my attitude or my parents or being far away from me or whatever.  i give her alot of credit.  it takes a lot for a person to put up with as much as i put her through.  i know she truly loves me and i truly love her.  i hope she knows that.  she's the best thing thats ever happened to me and i never want us to be apart!!!  I LOVE YOU DANIELLE!!!!   :)

well, best be going now to spend time with my fam and watch movies...  i'll write more later though, dont worry.  i have tons more to say.....

check ya lata...."

"event","well, it's almost 8pm and danielle just showed up.  i'm sooooo glad.  i've missed her all day.  i was supposed to go to her apartment to see her, but my dad was being a jack ass.  you see, i've been sick all week and slowly getting better.  so when i mentioned going out, he flipped and called me immature.  said that i should stay home and rest.  but when i asked if danielle could come here, he said yes.  what the hell is the difference???  either way i'll be doing the same thing.  i just wont be as relaxed here at home as i would be at danielle's.  oh well.  i know danielle hates putting up with my parents treating me like a little kid...  I HATE IT TOO!  i dont blame her at all.  i really wish they would realize that i know how to take care of myself and that i am grown up, etc.  this has got to be really hard right now especially with danielle fighting with her best friend.  i hate it when they fight.  i hate seeing best friends mad.  fortunately christine and i are doing well.  infact, she just asked me to be in her wedding.  christina (christines girlfriend) just asked her to marry her.  so technically they are engaged now!  :)  i'm so happy for them.  i hope it works out and i'm excited to be in their wedding!  i can't wait to ask danielle to marry me.  her and i went through a little ""marry me"" problem about a month ago and it was all my fault.  (NO DETAILS NEEDED!)  but i do really wanna marry her someday.  i am totally committed to her forever!  i love her soooo much.  infact, since she is downstairs, i better go be with her.  later gators....


ps.  the reason why the subject is flashback movie night is because i went through all of the old movies i have and found some pretty nifty ones...  even Lord Of The Rings when it was a cartoon.  how cool!!???!!"

"event","What an interesting day this has been.  The most interesting has occured recently, but I'll start with the boring stuff and work my way to the juicy stuff (and hence the reason for the subject line).  

Ok, well this weekend was a good one.  I spent Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday with Danielle.  It was great.  The best was when we just got to lie together and take each other in and enjoy each others company.  The next best part was when we were driving and talking.  Some of our best convos occur in the car...  i love it!  Then I'd have to say that making my cretive food was a good thing too.  We both had fun with it.  it was a project for my Creativity class.  We took graham cracker and crushed it up to make the ocean floor and beach.  Then took vanilla pudding and blue food coloring to make the ocean water.  we stuck gummy fish, sharks, and octopus in the water and gummy shoes, turtles, frogs, and worms in the graham cracker because it was the beach.  :)  creative huh?  my baby and i worked hard on it!  she helped alot and i owe most of it to her!  we did lots of stuff this weekend, but mostly all we did was make a mess of her room.  lol.  we tried to clean, but it didn't quite work out.  so anyways, then monday night we came back to sru so i could go to work and she came with me so she could study a little.  that was neat cuz i love spending time with her no matter what.  then she left and i went to bed.

today was another day with out her....  a sad day.  but i managed.  i woke up this morning and finished my history and philosophy paper.  then i went to Ed Psych.  then to History and Philosophy of Ed.  after all of that i hung out in my room doing odds n ends while talking to danielle online.  then i went to dinner with the girls in my hall then off to Creativity to hand in my creative food.  well that was all the boring part of today.  then the good stuff comes....

i got out of class early and walked outside, in the rain, back to my room.  i opened the door and to my surprise there was my roommate carrie with her shirt off and a guy from down the hall (dave) with his pants off.  she was giving him blow job.  YUCK  this kid is disgusting and she was doing that to him.... how gross.  so anyways, when i opened the door she said, ""hold on"" and so i quickly shut the door.  i waited til she opened the door and i came in and she had her shirt back on and he had his pants up, but his buckle was undone.  DA.  and then they started talking about pictures she had as if i didnt realize what was going on.  give me a break....  i'm not dumb.  ya know, everyone does sexual acts in the dorm and many many people get caught.  i dont really care about that.  what i do care about is the reasons why shes doing it and who she is doing shit with.  dave is a disgusting person and she is only being this way cuz she is trying to fit in or become more a woman or some shit.  she doesn't really like him and he doesn't like her.  shes giving up her morals for it and that pisses me off.  i know she wanted to wait to do sexual shit until she thought she was in love, but obviously she's thrown that out the window.  i dunno.  then again, when you've waited for so long, sometimes you just give in.  sometimes it makes you strong and sometimes weak....  i guess it's made her weak.  :("

"event","It's Tuesday the 27th of November.  Do you know what that means?  well....  a few things actually.  tonight was the night of kappa delta pi inductions.  i wa sin charge of doing the certificates and creeds for tonight which is kinda alot considering i'm on the historian.  but whatever.  then sara and i were there at 6 to get ready (it started at 8) and the catering service was supposed to be there at 630.  well around 715 we decided that they must not be coming so missy and i ran to giant eagle to get food.  we got enough for 70 peeps and it only cost $50.  how awesome.  but when we got back, ya know what....  the cater was there!  GRRRR. so missy, sara and i took all of the shit back to giant eagle.  after that, the induction ceremony went pretty smoothly.  LOL.

So lets travel back in time a bit...

last week was thanksgiving.  i loved having time off from school, and i loved being with danielle, but i hated being home.  i absolutely hated it.  i dunno why exactly.  it just keeps getting worse.  a day doesn't go by while i'm home that my mom isn't ragging on me about money or responsibilities.  i hate that.  the worst part isn't even that though.  it's that my dad doesn't speak his mind one way or the other.  i dunno.  but i had a great time with my girl.  i spent as much time with her as possible.  oh wait...  i spent every minute with her almost!!!   just the way i like it!  she is so special to me.  she's really helped me alot lately and i thank her for that.  i appreciate all that she does.  i love her family and friends.  they are all so kind and caring to me.  in fact, i met a new person this past weekend.....  lindsay.  she was a cool cat.  she reminded me alot of my friend lindsey.  both in looks and personality.  it was kinda creepy.  but fun.

oh, and before we even went to rochester, we went shopping on black friday with my sisters.  it was great.  we all had a blast i think.  danielle and my fam get along soooooo well.  i love it.  i bought her a vcr but the little snot saw it so i gave it to her early.  and i bought lots of stuff for peeps.  then we went to an Erie Otters Hockey game.  that was a blast.  blood was all over the ice!!!  lol.  i think she had fun too.  i hope so.  i really wanted to do something different with her and show her that erie does have more to offer, i have more to offer, and that we can do anything and have fun!

now i'm talking to matt george.  he's an awesome guy.  i haven't talked to him in so long really.  just off and on, but we are having a deep convo now about his ex gf and about my wonderful girl.  he's so happy for me and i feel for him.  it was a bad break up i guess.  i dunno.  but anyways, danielle is now online and i dont really have much else to write now.  so i'jm going to jet.  later y'all"

"event","Happy Saturday after Thanksgiving.  Ya know what, i'm happy!  extremely happy.  you might ask, ""why?""  well...  let me share with you the answer to that burning question.  first of all, i woke up in my girl's arms.  that right there is reason enough to be excited!!  then, i did things around her house with her and then i went home.  well, home wasn't all that great cuz i got into a small argument with my mother (nothing new) but i was still good cuz i knew i'd be returning to my baby.  so after dinner at my house, i went to danielles to pick her up for our DATE!  yes, i said date.  we're always together so i thought it would be nice to go out on an actual date.  well, it started off just as a date should, but then i ran out of money and she had to help pay.  go figure.  so it wasn't all that much of a date.  but, it was a great date none the less.  we went to the Civic Center and got tickets for the Erie Otters Hockey Game and then we went to McDonald's for food.  we then went to the game and had a blast.  the otters won and we saw lots of fights.  it was great!  but best of all, i was with my girl.  so in all actuality, it doesn't matter what we were doing...  as long as we were together.  afterwards, we went to my house where, once again, my mom had words to say to me.  but then danielle and i looked through an old photo album of mine.  it was super neat to look back at some of the old pics.  i was a rather cute girl once upon a time.  ;)  lol.  then i drove the pontiac sunfire back to danielle's.  why is that special?  cuz it's a standard!  why is that special?  cuz it's only my third time driving standard and it was super fun and rather easy!!!  i loved it!  :)  now i'm chilling in danielle's room while she's filling out her time card.  i guess i should go.  we are getting up early tomorrow so we can go to rochester...  how fun!  i'm excited!   ok, well i'm off to cuddle and have sweet dreams.  goodnight!"

"event","Well, today is black friday.  my sisters, danielle and i went shopping at 430 this am.  it was a blast...  but tiring.  in any event, te only thing i can think of right now are these issues i'm having.  danielle knows what i'm talking about.  i need to go see a doctor, but i'm kinda afraid to.  so we are trying to fix the problem ourselves to see if that works first.  hopefully it does cuz this problem has been lasting for many many years and i'm sick of it.  ya know?  yeah, i'm sure you have no clue what the hell i'm talking about so i'm just going to stop.  in fact, i'm going to just stop writing all together cuz i'm tired and my baby needs me to take care of her.  not really....  but i wanna!!!  :)  so until next time...  lata gata"

"event","Ok, listen up Sue and Danielle.  shti is going on between you two and i don't like it.  i dont like it for a couple of reasons.  1) you can't put me nor chris in the middle of this.  it truly has nothing to do with us.  and 2) you guys both need to stop using this damn journal as a way of talking to each other.  you need to say it over the phone at least.  yes sue, i know that danielle doesn't spend much time home and when she is home i'm with her.  i'm sorry.  but at the same time, i haven't seen nor hear you try very hard to see her either.  you've had moments where you were supposed to call or hang out, but things have come up.  you could've come to erie a couple of times, but you've been busy.  well...  if you're busy, dont you think danielle is too.  i barely get to see her.  her and i work hard at finding time for each other.  and Danielle...  i can't just put all of this on sue and you know that i'm right.  yes you hate homelife and yes you have a new life in erie, but maybe you can leave me home once or you can go home without your fam knowing so you can just chill with sue.  i dunno.  but i'm sure something can be done.

i agree with both of you.  i understand completely.  my best friend lives in florida.  she's come home a few times and when she does, she usually only sees me for a few minutes.  and i've gone to see her once but she spent all of her time with this new girl friend of hers.  so i understand completely.  but you can't let something like this get between you guys.  you both love each other very much otherwise you wouldn't be fighting about this.  you are both bigger than this.  act like it.  act like adults cuz thats what you are now.  i love you danielle so please dont take this the wrong way.  and sue, please don't misunderstand me.  i'm not trying to sound bitchy, mean, or bossy....  i'm just trying to help.  all i know is that you can't let this tear you guys apart.  please dont let it.  ok?  

i propose this...  
as for the holidays, dont question or judge each other. just let it be a time of love and friendship.  danielle, go home and stay for as long as you can handle.  dont plan on certain days or times.  and sue, put aside as much time for her as you can spare.  then, be understanding of danielle if she chooses to go home.  ok?  i think you're an awesome friend sue.  and hun, i think you're a great gf.  and most of all...  i think you guys make great friends.  please try to understand each other and love each other with all you have.  you never know when the words you say could be your last......."

"event","Well where to start?  After an amazing weekend with a beautiful woman, it's hard to find the words.  So let me just start with Friday and work my way to the present.  Friday was a day of hell and of sweet release for Danielle and I both.  I had major projects due and she had huge finals to take.  But once those were all over, we were done!!!  In the evening I went out with Carrie and other people to ChiChi's to celebrate her 21st bday.  It was ok.  Then, at 9pm, my baby girl showed up at my dorm!  I was soooo excited.  Not too much went on that night cuz she was tired, but I didn't care.  She was with me and that's all that mattered.  Then Saturday came and I went to work.  After that, we drove to Rochester, NY to spend time with Danielle's family.  It was great.  I always love spending time with her.  **Even when she's learning how to drive a standard!!  :)  Anyways, today she had to bring me back to school.  I hated having to leave her.  But I await the moment I'll get to look into her beautiful brown eyes again.  I love her so much.  I hope she realizes this.  And guess what...  I'm talking to her on the phone now.  So I'm going to go.  But just know this...  I'LL BE BACK!!!  :)"

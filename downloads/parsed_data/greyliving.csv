"event","It's only been during the last 6 months that I've really understood the phrase 'work is taking over my life' it feels like all I do is sleep, eat and work. I have no time for anything else, the weekends are filled with things to do and taking it easy or spending time o/l is not among them. 
This has left me out of touch with my online friends as well as my real life friends. Strangely it's also left me with the desire to submit again. I'm not sure if this comes from wanting someone to just take over and make my life less hectic. Besides I'm still not sure what I want out of a D/s relationship, scratch that I do know but I'm not sure how I go about getting it. If I even can get it or if it's just me romanticizing bdsm. I want the security, to feel cherished and appreciated, to feel loved and accepted. To know that someone else has the control, that I don't have to be strong all the time. I want someone to know me, someone who won't believe ""I'm fine"" when I'm not, someone who will help me understand all of this. 

I hate the fact that I'm so shy on the boards, that I don't take the chance to gain knowledge from the ones who give it. That I'm to shy to ask because the people on there have seen me around for a few years. 
I'm also afraid of K's reaction, it's not for her I know and at the time it wasn't for me either but now I'm not so sure. 
There are just so many things I'm unsure of that keep me from taking that step. I know people would help and support me in my journey if I took that step but I need someone to help me take it. 
Perhaps I never will, but I can't help but miss the person I was before even though it caused me pain in the end."

"event","I'm not in a talkative mood today. It's been a good day and I'm not feeling down or anything like that, I'm just not feeling like talking to anyone not online or in real life, yet I'm logged in to YIM. 
I don't want to log out, that would be like cutting myself off from everyone and I don't want that, I just don't feel like talking to anyone at the moment. I think I know why too, I have a lot of things on my mind and this is the first time in days that thoughts haven't been racing through my mind and everything around me is quiet. I'm sitting here enjoying the quiet, both in my head and around me, this is something I realised now. It's not often things around me are quiet, normally sounds from outside make their way in but right now everything is quiet. I love it when it's quiet! I've learned to appreciate the silence, the peace that comes with it, the feeling of just being. 
I think I need this more then I knew, I needed a break from everything, to connect with my self again. I'm feeling peaceful for the first time in a long time."

"event","Sometimes I really wonder how his mind work. How is it possible that we're related, brother and sister yet so different. It's not the first time he's disappeared and probably not the last either. The first time that he did this (if you count more then one night gone) was also the longest. He was 17 and he was gone for 5 days. None of his friends had seen him or knew where he was and he didn't answer his cellphone when anyone called. Eventually my mom went to the police to file a missing persons report only for them to tell her that even if they found him there wasn't much they could do other to tell him we where looking for him since he was over 16 y/o. 
Now that time really had me worried, the other times I block it out, I don't think about it, I ignore it. Cruel? Perhaps, but add to that the angry comments I have to listen to from my parents, the questions they ask me like I had the answers to. Then we he finally gets home, the shit really hits the fan so to speak. He walks back in like nothing has happened, mom starts to yell, he starts to yell because mom is yelling. When they're done, dad comes to relay what happened like I couldn't hear it anyway. 
This is the reason the door to my room is closed as soon as I'm in the room. I need to isolate myself to be able to stay sane. When the door is closed there's just me and my bunny, I don't have to bother about the rest. I can just be. My room might not be all that big and the door isn't sound proof, but it keeps them out and it keeps me sane. 
I've had the door open for about a week since it's a bit difficult to open while I'm on crutches and they've litterly taken it like a sign that they can come and go like they want to. I don't care what tv show dad is watching or what they're doing on it, I don't care if mom is interested in seeing if my bunny is asleep or not, I don't want them walking in and out my room disturbing me while I'm trying to read or watch TV. I just want to be left alone like normal. Is that really so difficult to understand???
I know it might sound as if I don't care, but I do, I just can't bear to listen to everyones troubles and add them to my own, I'm not that strong but noone seems to get that."

"event","Since my last update I've had surgery to repare a torn tenon in my ankle. Everything went good and I'm currently sentenced to 4 weeks with crutches and an aircast. Let me tell you that the aircast, while being very smart, is also very warm and has a tendency of making my toes numb when I'm sitting in my bed. 
Days are now spent online or watching TV, a movie or reading. It's going to be a long 4 weeks if they're not going to go faster then this.
It's not the first time I'm on crutches but I really had forgot how annyoing it is when you're not even allowed to put one foot down. I can barely do anything by my self anymore. I need help making breakfast or rather getting the things out of the fridge and to the table. Everything is just a pita atm. It doesn't help that the weather is beautiful and I would much rather be outside taking a walk instead of sitting here. But that's life isn't it?"

"event","It's almost here, only one month and a few days left until the day of my surgery. I've waited so long for that day to come, so long to before I finally got a date. I should be over the moon happy that it's so close and I was, for a few hours. I've had all these thoughts and doubts pop up recently. What if there's more damage then they saw on the MRI? What if the surgery somehow makes it worse? What if it doesn't get better even with the surgery? The doc has already told me that I shouldn't do gymnastics anymore, and one even told me I should be happy if I could run. I think that's what freaks me out, if I won't be able to run then what can I do exercise wise? 
I hate that this happened, hate that I had to give up somethings that I loved, hate that I basicly had to put my life on hold for over a year just to wait on surgery. Strange how you can be so sure that you want something one second and then the next second you're not so sure anymore. 
When did life stop being easy anyway? It just hits you one day, out of nowwhere, and then there's no more easy in life anymore. You really don't appreciate life enough when you're still a kid."

It's FINALLY here, on Tuesday the final episode of season 2 will air here in Sweden. Now my problem is that I've been in the states for 10 weeks, seen the whole season 2 on DVD and seen part of season 3 on TV over there. It's been very difficult for me to not tell my friends what's going to happen, and to remember what has happened so far and what hasn't.
Last Tuesday Izzie cut Denny's LVAD wire, and right after the show ended I called my friend, I got a scream for a hello! She thinks Izzie is crazy and should be fired, gave me this hole speech about how wrong it was and how stupid George was for just standing there. I couldn't say much, when I first saw the episod I felt the same way, but then I saw the second part, the part where Denny proposes, where he dies and where it's so plain to see how much they love eachother. That episode really changd my view of Izzie again, she's not some crazy person, she's a person in love and she knows what she did was wrong, that's why she quits and tells the truth to the Cheif. 
Now if season 3 could hurry up and air here soon I would be happy! This has to be the best show I've ever watched. 
Oh, and I got totally hooked on Chasing cars by Snow Patrol now as well, it's my new favourite song!"

"event","Isn't it funny how friends come and go in your life? My oldest friend I've known for 16 years, we used to be best friends, did everything together. Then when we where 14 she changed school and that's when we began drifting apart. She's studying in another city now, though she usually sends me an email once summer comes asking to get together and cath up. It always ends with her saying we need to stay in touch more, I send emails but never get any back. 
I have another friend who I met about 2 years ago, we talk almost daily and I've had so many fun times with her, there's never a dull moment when she's around! I love you C, you never fail to make me laugh!
Then there's another type of friends, online friends, they tend to come and go more easily. One of them said she would always be here for me, I haven't heard from her for almost a year now, I see her online and sometimes wonder how she is, but I know sending an IM is useless, I won't get an answer. The one friendship that's surprised me though is with D. She and I liked the same guy, he and I had a huge fight and haven't spoken since, D is still with him. It doesn't matter if it's been months or weeks, the offline messages we send to eachother mean so much to me. She's there when I don't know who else to talk to even if I haven't said so much as hello to her for months. That's friendship. I'm lucky I guess, I don't have that many friends but the true friends I have are always there for me when I need them. I'd rather have a few true friends that I can tell anything to, without worring what they will think, then lots of friends that I don't really know. 
And D we really need to talk sometime soon when we're both online, or another crazy email will come your way. I need you to help me get back to where I used to be. I don't think I trust anyone but you to help me do that. I miss you!"

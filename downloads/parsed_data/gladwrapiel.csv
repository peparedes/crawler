People I thought they were close friends have been strange to me.I know I have been quite grouchy and stressed lately and have lost my patience. But at least they could ask ""Hey! How are you feeling? Would you like to go out or chat?"" - that's what frinds do. Not just fooling around or ask you to be there, stand by them when THEY have problems or feel depressed.

Last month I got a kitten as a b-day present. I named him Puk-like the naughty elf from Shakespeare's ""Middsummer night's dream"". He is 3 months old and one of the most beautiful kittens I 've ever seen (not because it's mine).I will try to upload a photo of him sometime.

Watching him for the past month I 've wondered a few things about cats, such as 
""Why do cats have a tail?""
a) to keep flies away / b)to chew it when they are hungry
and   "" Has a cat's tail its own life?"" well-I think it has. that's why Puk can't reach it every time he tries to grab it.

That's all for the moment about cats.

"event","Hope you guys had a very nice holiday season with lots of fun and food (but don't you dare to complain that you have put any weight on - as some of you will do)

Another year has gone.... a new one has come (once again).

2004 was,I could say, a good year for me....and here is my list of the Top-5 best and worst moments, I should never forget.

Top-5 Best Moments:

1) Finally moved in my own house.Got rid of my sis (he-he) and have my own garden. The neighbours are a little annoying but I must live with them since they are my sis and my bro-in-low.

2) The Olympic Games that took place in Athens and Volos, and my participation to them. (No, I didn't win any gold medals but I have 3 sets of uniforms which I can sell for about 300 euros each, in case I need cash- No f****ing way I will ever do that) .

3) My new job. In May I had the opportunity to get rid of my old bosses (still the police hasn't found their corpses) and finally work with people I like and with no bosses (they are in Athens).

4) Impossible is Possible. Who could have imagined that the National Football (aka soccer) Team would ever win the European Cup. I asure you, I didn't.  And neither the rest of the European Football (that's soccer) Fans.

5)................... (there must be a fith one but I can't remember it- I will update later)


Top-4 Worst moments:

1) The Asian Tsounami disaster. What a tragedy.... I felt really ""ashamed"" when I had to celebrate the New Years Eve when so many people are suffering.

2)The aftermath (I think that's what it's called) of the Big Olympic Party.....

3)The end of the LOTR Trilogy..... No more Hobbits and Elves on the Big screen, no more anticipating for the extended DVDs.

4)The Bush's re-election..... Just hope that this a** won't make things worst for the rest of his presidency.


Well that's some of the things I should remember for the rest of my life (or as long as I am not suffering from memory loss)

Happy New Year again ...."

<P>Last Saturday the Olympic Flame passed from my hometown, Volos. I wouldn'd miss this event for anything, so there I was along with 20000 people cheering and crying ( I did at least). The ceremony was impressive since it took in Volos' sea- side and the fullmoon background.</P>

Until one day a local policeman found him and took him to an orphanage. He was five years old.</P>
<P>In&nbsp;his first weeks there, he was hostile to everyone.Considering he had grown up with dogs, he couldn't talk, didn;t know how to eat at the table, he had never slept in bed etc. He was attacking and growling at everyone.</P>
<P>With the help of a specialised psycologist, in the next four years his attitude changed and he was adopted by a foster family, at the age of seven. Vanja had to live in a small house with 7 more people, but no problems occured. He was still under psychological support.</P>
<P>He could live with other people but it was difficult for him to learn how to talk.In his first year in school Vanja was neurotic unfriendly even hostile to his simblings an classmates but by the end of the year he could speak, read and behave, so he decided to join one of the many&nbsp;nillitary schools in Russia.</P>

"event","Not that you would care about elections but here is an account of how Greek parliament elections are held....

Thousands of Greeks caught ferries, buses, planes even donkeys (jk) back to birthplace islands and mountain villages to vote.The main choice is between 2 political dynasties that have dominated modern political life. Here is a short profile of the 2 main opponents...

Ladies and Gents... On the right, representing New Demo cracy (conservatives) is Mr C.Karamanlis, nephew of the establisher of the party. 
For the past 7 years he has been trying to persuade the people that he is the perfect PM- plump, clumsy, with a beautiful wife that every politician would like to have. He is the beloved kid of grannies and elder people... Just don't ask him to play football ( he has broken his leg in front of the cameras trying to score).

On the left, representing PASOK (socialists) is Mr George Papandreou (aka Giorgakis- Little George). He is grandson of a former PM and son of the establisher of the party and also former PM,Andreas Papandreou.
He was elected president of PASOK by more that 1 million party voters (not really impressing since he was the only candidate) only because of his high poll ratings and for being his father's son.

The winner will be the 1st PM born after WW2. According to latest exit polls, the conservatives appear to be heading for an easy win. But some fear a return of the 2000 elections when ND supporters were on the streets celebrating early exit polls showing that their party was the winner only to see the Socialists surge the victory and remain in power  (for more than 18  years). 

Isn't that wonderful?"

"event","My sis surprised me yesterday by buying me a ticket to see ROTK...again .She did well!!! I had a really bad day at work and wathcing ROTK once more was the best thing. I really enjoyed that movie. Ok i know most of you will still nagging about the changes and the parts that were left out... but hey people it still is a damn good adaption of the books... 

I really enjoined the battle scenes and the Dimholt sequence (of course it wasn't as described in the books but it had a better effect on Aragorn's character).And Selob oh.. she was perfect. Of course Frodo looked like beeing a kokoretsi (that's a traditional greek food wich Chetna wouldn't like to taste). As for Lego's fight with  the Mumakil was so funny...

Can't wait for the extended DVD..."

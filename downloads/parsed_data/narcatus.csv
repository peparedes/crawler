I am no longer going to post things on here. I'm tired of people just being angery, and ranting about people, and yes, I know I've done it myself. So, I think I'm gonna take a good, loooong break from livejournal. I may comeback, but I don't really know. I may post random poems on here, If I so wish. Anyway, this is my goodbye, I may be back, like I said, but most likely not, and if so, I mayu be under a new name, that I will tell to people of interest. Not that you all aren't interesting) 
If you need to talk to me, please, call me. I'd rather takl to you in person, or over the phone.

Thank you, and goodbye."

HOMG!
Kay, I don't know what's with the random-ness that is me posting random ""HOMG!"" everywhere, possibly from the exsess of Gaiaonline, but that's alright. 
Anyway, so instead of ripping my head off, and shoving it in a vat of boiling acidity goodness, all my mother said was ""Well, your an idiot""....and that was it....it was crazy. So much posting I've done today, perhaps I'll stop now."

"event","Because Of my actions tward my jazz band test, I am most likely grounded. wow, I haven't been grounded since...last year. This'll be fun. Uhm, yeah so I won't be on at all, probibly in the atleast 2-3 weeks. Depends on the mood my mother is currently in. Let's make it a month, shall we? Not that I'm on much anyway. I spoke with my dad, and he was not happy at all, which is quite understanable. I was first mad at Mr. Lyons...but now I'm mad at myself. I'm stupid, and my mother will remind me either on the phone, or later on tonight, or perhaps both. I'm really looking forward to this. Nice knowing you."

Okay, so I missed my first class of Driver's Ed, which wasn't the brightest move on my part, but whatever, because I lost my sheet that told me when it was. Anyway, so I called the school, and now I cannot miss anymore classes, or I guess I'm thrown out. That's kinda sad. Anyway, so....yeah, that kinda sucks, but it's purly my fault.=D

Uhmm...nothing else to report. I have to find time to do my jazz band test, I'm thinking I might gio sometime soon...today...before lunch, but I'm not sure. Meh, I'll see, and if it doesn't work, I guess my mark in Jazz kinda drops alittle, not that I'm worried.

Well, this litte update is really done. I just wanted the world to know how stupid I am. Man, I'm laughing at myslef...is that just alittle sad?

*EDIT*
So I went for my jazz test, and he wouldn't let me do it. That's right, he wouldn't let me do it. Marks are already in, and it's too late, is all I got outta him. Well fuck. It's my fault ZI know, but why couldn't he let me like...do it, and not add in the mark..or SOMETHING?! Now he's just gonna humilliate me! fuck!"

"event","I have a scrapbook of memories,
jumping out of the page,
running around as we please,
making history in our own footsteps,
Things to childish for our age.

Flooding the street,
the memories come,
like a herd of rabid sheep,
fluffy warm, and angery,
and then struck dumb.

Our litte feet wandering the sunsetting valleys,
and the waters' edge of the world,
and to our now dark alleys,
that we wander around in looking for inspiration,
But how did we know it had unfurled?

The destiny we have awoke to, 
and the layers upon layers of time,
and the times we went to the zoo,

Looking at my scrapbook,
All our memories comming back,
and taking a closer look,
I should've helped you pack.

it's a simple poem, I made, and it rhymes. I thought it was okay, and the second last stanza is supposed to look that way yes, it weird I know. You don't have to comment on it, it's just....simple, and slightly stupid. But thanks for taking the time to read it."

"event","So, I though it time to update.
Christmas was fun, got stuff, and most of all, spent two days with my family. Boxing day was fun also, I went out for a Jones soda with Jackie, and then around the mall for an hour, we ended up however, in EB games by Wal-mart for a video game. 
I have an MP3 player, it's awesome, I can carry music with me on the go, all the time, but I'll mostly use it for walking polaces, and that's about all I need it for. I've dyed my hair, bleached actually. It kinda looks like Kalin porters I'm told, but shorter, and I don't look like a girl. But whatever, I like it, and so do a couple others. 

Now, on to other matters. I feel bad for the ways I act, I say things, and don't mean it, and for that, I am sorry, I don't mean to be a popous ass. Please forgive me. In other peoples defence, they most likely know more then me. 

No art updates, I've been ina  non drawing kind of mood, but I have some idea on what I'm gonna do.

Today I got a new CD, Ace of Base - Cruel Summer from the eletronics exchange store near Joey's ony, and it's a pretty awesome store. I suggest people go there for cheap, in awesome condition, used CD's. (Jackie, Delerium - Karma is there for about 10 bucks, go and get it!) 

That's really all that's happened in my life., I work tomorrow, with Mike, 8-2. I hope everything works out. SO, that's everything in a nutshell. 

Thank you and goodnight."

"event","Yes, my weird updating thingy told me to update today. So, Sarah Slean (did I spell it right that time?) didn't come. it was too sbnowy out, and it deeply saddened me. But Gwen was fun. I was gonna get merch, but I decided agiainst it, I didn't want to draw...too much attention to me. Uhmm..I haven't been to JAAW in a loong wihile, and if you guys continue to pester me, I'm gonna get more mad than I was before. I do like going and seeing everybody, but really, is there a point of going downtown to see one episode of anime I can rent/buy? I don't really see a point. But I do miss my clone, and Vicky, and yes, even JR. 
So, my mother and pre-cal teacher are in constant communication. It sucks, and for all of you who tell me to ""not do your homework, you can do it later"" not anymore. My mother will get an e-mai from my techer with my progress on it. Belive you me. (Even though, no one's ever really told me to do that in the first place) 
I'm sorry. It seems that everytime I update I'm in a bad mood. And it's nice to know, that this is a time when I don't have to smile, and be happy-go-lucky. I can be...more of myself. I can't bring down the world, and I can't lie...but sometimes....I have to, and it hurts.
Moving right along, don't worry, I'm not extremly depressed...just slightly ticked...and I haven't a clue as to why.
I have a bullying workshop on Monday, and Tuesday. PLUS a concert on Tuseday and Wednesday, AND work sometime on there. My life has become busy, and I'm charrishing everything, like the time I spend vegging, or with my friends, or...at school even. I almost dread going to work, to hear my boss treat others, and me, like children, who have no clue why they are there, or what they're supposed to do. it's frustrating.
Tomorrow I have nothing reall planned, but I'm gonna give a quick guess and say justin is going to call me. Or not, I doesn't matter. If someone wants to do something, don't hessitate to ask. But nonetheless, I should get back to life. 
Kiara just cheered my up alittle, with her collective banter, so i think I'm good. Wel, I'm off, thanks for this.

(Musical started today, I'm slightly excited! Can't wait!)

I lost the DDR tournament that was helled there, I'm prettyt bad at it, I have decided. I ate some, spoke with random people, ate somemore, and spoke with more random people. I tried to ""follow"" my clone around so I could meet people, and learn what to talk about to them, but in the end, I really didn't know, and hoped I could say random things, and make sence. I hope they like me. Then...Brenen....or as I like to call him the dealer (Not to be confused with Brendan, my clone) ""tired"" to sell me hash. It wasn't succesful, but whatever. It was fun all around, and I hope I can throw a pretty awesome party for my birthday. Meaning, better than what I have been doing (i.e. sitting in my basement, watching a movie/playing a video game, and eating crap) to possibly sitting outside, and doing random stuff. To me that seems fine. I may have a fire pit at that time, but I'm not sure. I hope everyone had fun, and wish to see them again next year. I'm hoping the friendship between me and Brendan doesn't diminish, like it has with so many other guys in the past. *sigh* Let us hope it isn't a matter of time before he hates me. Let us hope, he'll like me. JR, and Jen, you shall meet him later."

I have decided to also write about each of my closest friends. please bare with me.

Ali-Out of all of them, I have known you the longest. Even if I seem to be ""Ignoring"" you, I really am not. I only tune out when you start on your obbsessive fangirl-ness. Without you, I wouldn't ever know any of my friends now., I thank you, so much, for what you've done.

Jackie-Your like a sister. Someone I can lean on, and someone I can talk to. You make me feel better about myself. Just like a sister would do. I'm glad I can talk to you, and am glad you can talk to me. Without it, I doin't know what I'd do.

Randi-Ah, my master. Your like the protector of the group. If something's wrong because someone's done something wrong, you will go up to them, and threaten them. Sure, the threats may mostly be empty, but it's nice to know, I have someone who cares enough to beat someone up for me. That and you have to protect your minoin.

Neila-The one I don't know as much as anyone. Your always there, for a talk. Your always up for tea, cofee, and sushi. Your hair constantly changes, but the person inside stays the same. I thank you for your awesome personality, and your talents, like singing, that keep me cheerful.

Matt-I...I don't know what to say. Your amazing. You treat me the same, no matter what I say. I'm glad your my friend..I don't know what else to say, your Livejournal post made me speechless.

Laura-Your awesome. Even after we...well, ""went out"" your still my friend, and for that, I am eternally grateful. I had hoped we would be, but was afriad we'd end up never speaking again. Now I know I can alwatys count on you, to be there, and you can do the same for me. We're friends, and nothing anyone says can take that away.

And finally,

Jen-You mean the world to me. No matter if I kill everyuhing, or what, you always seem to come out laughing. I introduced you to my group of friends, and hope they like you, and to my great releif, they did. Your amazing Jen, don't forget that. No matter what, your amazing. Don't change, for anybody, cause without you, my life is.....just empty. Your smile lightens my day. (It sounds like I'm hitting on you...doesn't it?) No matter what anyone says, you always seem to come out on top, whether it's an unsult, or just a joke.

there, it may seem corney, but this is all true. Without you guys, I don't know where I'd be."

Just to let you know, I know all about the conversation you and Jackie had, and I'm aware of what you were talking about with Mel aswell. The only thing I have to say to you, is that I'm disappointed in you. How could you hurt me. It's not only my fault, if you had blamed us all, this may not have happened, but see what you've done by just blameing one person? You've hurt me. I'm so disapointed in you. I thought you would've known better. I'm sorry. Now, what are you going to say to me tomorrow? Are you going to pretend everything's alright, and just forget about it until you can talk to people about me? Or are we going to sit down, and talk about this like normal civialized human beings.

I'm sorry for liking the things you do, because you play/do them, over and over again. So, you know what? Because of what you said yesterday, I'm assuming you don't like me to listen to what you like. So fine. I have already put all my CD's away, and I'm going to burn a couple more, of the stuff I like. 
I'm sick and tired of it all, so fine, I give up. You pulled the last straw./ You hate me, I hate you back., There, happy? I'm not. But then again, what the hell you care? As long as your happy, everythings dandy isn't it? Well, fuck. I can't even talk to antyone anymore, because then I ""hit on them"", not like you even know the meaning, miss ""I date losers!"" I know, a low blow, but that's all I have. I'm too angery to even type right. This isn't something you can drop and say ""We're done with this, we've moved on"" because that really hurt. And this time, a sorry cannot undo, what has been done. And now, I will not tollerate anyone ""Jumping on the bandwagon"" either. And don't say you haven't. Invader Zim comes to mind. I don't want any symp[athy from anyone, this is now who I am, deal. I've had enough of the fucking shit to last me a life time. I thought I was safe here, but you know what? I'mn only safe when I'm with my friends. And who cares if they're not popular, or listen to music that I don't like, or so on. I don't try to change them. They are amazing the way they are. I'm just so angery. Why? Why do you have to make my life a living hell? You think I don't have feelings? You do this to get a rise out of me. But now you've gone too far.

My clone, or twin or whatever, joined JAAW, yesterday. It was great, but one problem, that was the last time I go regularly. Now I'm going irregularly. I somehow thought there were like....2 weeks left before school, but no, there's one. One week. And I'm scared. And next week there's no JAAW. So I propose we all get together sometime during the week (Aka, our JAAW group, Including Randy and Brendan) and hang out, that would be fun. And it would be like...yeah fun.

The time has come,
And good-bye is imminent.
But is it truly?
When you think about it hard,
And long, and forever,
Good-bye means almost nothing, 
But I'll see you again means all the world.

(Chorus)
Whether your here,
Or not, we're always there.
And if your feeling down, just stare,
At the stars.
And the feeling shall wash over,
and you'll know, we're there by your side.
Forever.

If you ever feel lonely,
Like no one really cares,
Or feels anything about you, 
Look at your memories,
and take a stride down Memory Lane.
See all your past memories, friends,
And all that we have to give.

(Chorus)
Whether your here,
Or not, we're always there.
And if your feeling down, just stare,
At the stars.
And the feeling shall wash over,
and you'll know, we're there by your side.
Forever.

(Bridge) 
Just like when we were young,
And never knew.
What happened to the time,
It just flew by,
And now it's time,
To say good-bye.

(Chorus)
Whether your here,
Or not, we're always there.
And if your feeling down, just stare,
At the stars.
And the feeling shall wash over,
and you'll know, we're there by your side.
Forever.....
Forever.....

"event","Yes, I have decided to get a new e-mail. The one I have is old, and I don't like the name anymore, so I'm going to get a new one, it may be with Gmail, as it's Canadian, and canada rules, in a non patriotic way (Don't say anything about that, I'd perfer to keep this entry) or hotmail again, because I know how it works. But screwing around with new things is fun. 
Moving on, I had the best experience this morning. I must say, it's one thing I won't forget soon. So, I couldn't get to sleep last night, it just wouldn't work, so at around 1:30am, I fall asleep, and then proceeded to wake up at around 7:30am. As I was laying in bed, I smell nothing other than vomit, so I thought ""well, it wasn't me, I don't vomit in my sleep"" so I go back to sleep for half an hour. Upon waking up, I look over my bed, to find two presents, of dog vomit, waiting for who knows long, on my litte bit of carpet. I had forgotten the dog was sleeping with me. 
And that's my story, not a great one, but I thought I'd share it with you, as I am prone to doing things like that, actuall,y I'm not, but I needed something to write about. 
Now on to my last bit of business, my new e-mail, again. It would seem not wanting my e-mail is bugging a couple people, I seem not to care, if I don't like it, I can change it, it's not a ""waste"" as the old account will be deleted in a months time of me getting a new e-mail, so that being said, it's not a waste, it's just a new begining, besides, my name has a Zelda reference, and....really, if that doesn't say ""King of Video Game Nerds"", I don't know what does."

"event","As I was sitting here, eating my fruit loops, like I always do, and then it hits me, it's time to update!

I went to Ai-kon yesterday. It was a blast! I've never been to a convention before, and I gotta say, it's one hellava good time, even if it may be the Asian shit I love so much Mike. I met soo many different people, it's hard to keep track of it all. I wish I had a camera to take bundles of pictures with, and so on, but sadly, I didn't. So, I'll explain it, as best as I can, in words, starting from the begining.

Alright, so I woke up early to go to work, as my boss wanted me to work 3 hours yesterday, and found that there was nothing to do, but try and make myself look busy. Eventually, I had to wrap cans, I know it sounds odd, but that's what I did, for the rest of my time there. I came home, and ate and showered, then called Jackie to see were, and how much the kon was, it turns out it was 30 bucks for that day because of some reason, I think it may have been the dance...but anyway, I got there cos my brother drove me there. I met Matt, who shpwed me around...alittle bit, and then just went off to talk to Kat. I wanted to see the whole thing, but he had his heart set on staying put, so I found Randi I believe tro show me around...or was it Ali...I can't remember anymore, it was too much fun. Anyways, then I saw the black and white mages, from tthe first Final Fantacy, dancing, and decided to check that out, and it was fun indeed. There, I met the first person who spoke to me, other than my friends. This was Jen, a tiney little 15 year old. She was dressed up as Kairi from Kindom Hearts. It turns out, most of her friends were angery with her, and I felt bad, so she followed me around for the rest of the kon, she could get alittle annoying with her constant talking, and exessive energy (which made me feel alittle bombarded, but that's alright, she was nice) but everythiung turned out good in the end. 

Well, the next thing I know, I'm wandering around aimlesly (As everyone left me alone, and made me feel sad =( ) with my newest friend, and I see Randy (A guy I know, yes, I have a guy frind Randy, and a girl friend Randi, with an I) and he runs past, so I'm thinking, meh he musent have seen me, so I continue walking, only to hear, him yelling at this guy that I was the one he was talking about. Preveous to wandering, I had heard that there was someone who looked like me at the kon, it made me confused. ANd then this guy turns around, and takes a picture of me and him standing side by side (I'm taller, by a hair..hehehehehe). Well, after I saw the picture, and agreed with him that we do look alike, we got to talking, and it would seem, that other than our main interests, and eye colour, WE'RE EXACTLTY THE SAME!!!!! Soo...I met my second new friend, and now twin/clone/doppleganger/whatever the hell you want to call it. I just call him Brendan...that works for me. ANd then, after, everyone got in line to go see the cosplay contest (As All my friends were in it, except a few) And I saw manya funny things, that I shall not go into detail for, as this is already running on the long side. 

After all this, I went to Pizza Hut with my ""stalker"" Jen, Joc, Ali, and Rohnda, and had some...interesting conversations.......
And after all that, we got back, (I took off my cat hat, as I was dressed up as Brendan for a while)I put on Randi's GIR hat, and Ali had a great idea to put glowy earing on it, and then, I put more glowey things on, and headed for the dance. It was fun, most people there were dancing, or just jumping around. I danced, and made a fool of myself, and it couldn't have been any more fun-er than it already was. Then sadly, something happened to Jello, and she was crying because of Matt,and everyone was angery, so, as sweaty as I was, I left the dance, and begun talking more to Brendan, that lead to people saying they had a new cuddle buddy, but I'm the original, so I'm better, and we hug the same too...I'm starting to think...we are too much alike.....

And that, my friends, is the story I have told you, which was fun, and quiet long, if I do say so myself. 

Thank you, and Good-morning!"

I should most likely give her back her PS2 which I havn't played as much as I wanted, but no memory card = no fun really. But all was well anyway. I am smiling, and it's fun! =D Umm..let me see, I got a Gryffendor shirt, from Old Navy, it's awesome, but not truly Harry Potter, I just thought it looked cool, and a new CD, which by chance is the Killers. I am so happy about that!!!!! Ho hum, there's still nothing to really do at my house, but today's my day off work, I work the rest of the week, no JAAW for me. But I'll be going....in some weeks to come, so don't fret. I'm kinda bored, and there's nothing to do, perhaps I'll go surf the net. Hello friens, I have returned."

So I got my days off, as I am going to Grand Forks with my family on Friday. It shall be amusing. And Ali, I can be taxed. I file a  income tax thing, and I get all my money back. But that's only for later, not now. 
So the samew things have been happening. Nothing. And everyone's mad at me cause I can't get the days off for Ai-kon. I know, it sucks, but hounding me to try, won't do anything. It's just the way my boss works. Just give it up, next year, I can come. I'm sorry, but yes, that's the way it's gonna have to be, case closed. 
Umm...so work is fine. Closing isn't that hard, and everyone knows me there now. Well, almost everyone. And I'm begining to see the regulars. It's kinda fun to watch them come in week after week, and buy the exact same things almost every time. Everyone at work still treats me like I don't know anything, and I don't know what I'm doing, but I do. They ask me things I do know how to do, like, ""Can you do the sign, do you know how?"" or ""Do you know how to do the dairy?"" and my response is always the same, a plain and simple, yes. I've been shoved in the dairy so much, it's almost second nature to stay in there. But meh, life goes on, soon, they'l know I can do things, and won't bother me about it. I look forward to that date. Well, that's about it. Kiara wants the computer, and I shall let her have it. usually, someone would put something witty here, but I've got nothing, nothing at all. So just a normal ""Goodbye"" is in order.

Goodbye."

So Johhny is gone, and there are no tears for him, I had no emotional attachment to him at all really, but I do miss him, such a cool guy. It seems everyone in my life is drifting away from me, I don't think and I hope it isn't on porpose. I know that me having a job is a part in that, but I need the money. 

So, why do people take other people for granted? I'm just asking in general. Is it just for the sake of it? Cause they can? I dunno, do I want to know? I doubt it, but I shall find out one day, and the truth shall slap me in the face like a giant salmon just out of the water. 

When all seems lost, in disparity,
The slumbering giant awakens, 
In the valley of the dead,
Where nothing, is what it seems.

I dunno were that came from, it reminds me of an over-ripe pumpkin, I wonder why. Oh well, whatever may be. may be.

I went to the Ex today, for the first time, woot. I had fun, and hope to do it again later. Saw my Trainer from IGA, I don't know what else to call him, but that, or John (Johhny as well). I had hoped to have fun, and I did, but I had a biting feeling inside of me. *sigh* somethings happen though. I'll check up on you later Jen, m'dear. Saw Nemo too, that was fun. I didn't go on the ferris wheel, too scary, but almost everything else. I had hoped there'd be more, but I was really not missing anything, except the Starship. You spin around in a circle, and are plastered against the wall. I sat cross legged on that thing,and I think I'm still woozy. Also, I saw Matt, and Melissa, that was fun. Sorry I didn't talk much, but I was too busy haveing fun, I'm sorry guys. 

Not much else happened. Well, Mike is tryin; to get to sleep, so I'll stop updating now. G'night all, though I won't sleep for a while, too much excitment, sorrow, and caffine! Xd"

We made them BLUE! and we dyed the syurp...RED! and we also dyed our drinks (which were in wine glasses) different colouirs. We had tryed to dye our coacoa, but it didn't work so well. 
So after the colour feasco, we headed down to Connie's.....and watched....something man wasn't meant to see. That's really all I'm going to say about that.....and I got more manga from Connie! XD Now I can draw some more awesome pictures! 
Umm...No school anymore, whoo for that, and exams are coming, so I must study hard! (I said I would, but I havn't picked up a book since!)

Last night, as I was at Ali's, Randi stopped by, aand we all hung out together. It was fun, and we ate candy, yum. that's really it. It twas fun telling you all this pointless, but awersome story.

And now i go back to my question, of what should I do?

Should I just give up hope?
Should I think that it won't hurt me? 
Should I lie back and pretend nothing is happeneing?
Or, should I put on my fake happy-go-lucky self, and hide what's behind my eyes?"

Dear friend,
how can i make you believe,
that you are awsome,
just the way you are.

How can i make you see,
what you have become.
You're a drone,
Of so many people's thoughts, and beliefs.

How can i make you think,
that anyway you want to be,
You should be,
and that your amazing just the way you are.

How can I believe all of this,
when you don't even belive yourself?



I call it ""Dear Friend"" and it's to someone with blonde hair. Don't comment on this, just read it my friend, for you ARE amazing just the way you are. I hope you never EVER change for the sake of other people liking you. Cause then i may not like you. You are your own person, can you understand that? E-mail me."

I mainly made this for chirstine, cause i was too lazy to draw her a picture, but also for anyone down opn themnselves as of late)

The tears roll down,
And the river of tears begins.
And all you can here are whispers.
""Loser, jerk, geek"" 
And you come face to face with your fear.

It hurts,
You breath, 
And wait, for some sign of help,
And it never comes.

The tears wash away the greif, 
And yet, they leave a feeling of emptiness,
Which you cannot fill with anything of value.
A hole forms in your heart.

It get steadily bigger, 
Untill your heart is no more, 
Then it engulfs your soul.
An empty shell, in a sea of people.

The rain falls,
I close the door to my soul, 
And let it wash away in the coming cleansing.
The waters penetrate my heart,
And then i am no more.

But you are there, 
And you care.
You pick up the shattered pieces,
Of my heart, and glue it together,
With the love you have kept for me.

Then i breath,
I move, 
and i know you are there,
With me, forever, and always.
And so shall i be for you.

The people i once knew, and loved, 
abandoned me, without a care.
You saw me hurt, and held me close,
You told me everything was going to be alright,
and i believed you.

But what know?
As i hurt with pain so bad,
You still tell me everything is going to get better,
Then i stop believing, 
And let the Abyss known as life,
wash me away in it's tears of sorrow.

Okay, i don't know why it's so sad, i just had a creative streak, and wrote it, it sounds like i'm sad, but the most i am is worried, but what else is new?"

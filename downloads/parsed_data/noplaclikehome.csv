I thought I was good and I could move on, haha thats what I thought now the reality is, I have&nbsp;NO idea whats going on with that anymore. I still feel it, but I'm not sure whats happening on the other side. UGH why can't I just get the nerve to <em>do something.</em> UGH UGH UGH, I want it to all be ok, but for that to happen I'm going to have to get over being so shy and just say what I think.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only 2 more months till Graduation....I'm so excited....but so sad at the same time. I don't want to leave my friends and the people I love to death. Louisville or NKU, I'm not 100% sure yet, I guess well have to see what happenes in the next few weeks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WELL I can't really think of anything else thats going on, if you want some clarafication, just ask.

"event","<P>So many emotions, So many tears. </P>
<P>Sitting by myself, thinking of you.</P>
<P>Wishsing that it wasn't true.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So my birthday is in SIX days, woop woop, right? Yeah, I'm thinking it's not going to be that way :( . Something tells me that it's going to suck. Come to think of it, the next few weeks are going to suck! I want school to be over, but what happens after that? Friends go their seperate ways, you loose the ones you love, you leave your family and the places you know best. I'm not ready for that!!! I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not ready. </P>
<P>There is still so many unanswered questions and so many mixed up emotions, and for me there still is a hole that needs to be mended, but if that is going to happen I am going to have to do something about it, cause i'm the only one that can. :(&nbsp; &nbsp;:.(</P>

So last night I sat in my basement by myself and watched Sweet Home Alabama and the Notebook. Prolly not the best thing to do since I have so many things going through my mind. Needless to say I cried. I also thought a lot about somethings, thats not good either."

<P><FONT color=#000099>Tell me why is it so hard to give an explanation, thats all I want/need. It doesn't even have to be an in depth one, as long as I get one. Ugh!!! I have so many things going on and so many thing I have to worry about, I can't deal with it all. Maby after this semester is over some of the stress will go away, hopefully. Can't wait till Prom and Senior dinner dance, and all the Senior stuff in the spring,&nbsp;but I know that when they come, they will go so fast and then I will have to deal with leaving my friends and the places I know best, I don't want to think about that thought.&nbsp;I'm not really in the Christmas spirit at this point, mostly cause I have no one to share it with, and the one I want to share it with is being a fucking jackass, so thats not really helping me much either. I seriousley wish everything was perfect and the way i want them to be. Too bad thats not the case. I need a great night out&nbsp;where I am busy every second cause when I'm not doing something, I think, and when I get to thinking about whats going on, I get sad and I don't want to be sad, I just want to be happy. Is that too much to ask??? &nbsp;Ugh too much to think about..... Thanks to everyone who listens and is there for me to vent on, I really appreciate it, Love you all!!</FONT></P>"

I&nbsp;LOVE my cousin Jessica and I don't really get to talk to her that much, so I talked to her for like two hours. Ate lots and lots of great homemade food, omg, my grandmas stuffing is sooo good! Played with my little cousins a little, then made my Christmas list for my god parents. </FONT></P>

I hate it, I need to say something, but since you know me, you should know that I never say anthing. I keep it all in till it's so painfull I break down and start crying over the stupidists thing. But no one gets to see that part cause no one cares enough to be there when it is happening. It's when I'm all alone with nothing to do. And when I'm alone, I start thinking, and when I start thinking, I remember how good it used to be and how much the last&nbsp;12&nbsp;months have changed a lot. I hate being alone cause I hate thinking and realizing that what I think is, really isn't. And I see I should change&nbsp;some things, but I wold be too hard, and then I would have very little.</P>

I know I shouldn't let what others do effect what I do, but it's so hard not to.&nbsp; I just don't know what to do. I'm so out of it! I just wish everything was easier, like it was before, long before. I am very protective of the people I care about and I don't want them to make the wrong choices or do the wrong thing, but there is nothing I can do to change that. This isn't just friends, it's family too. My life is so confusing, I don't know what I want to do, I don't know where I belong, I don't know how I'm going to get through all this, I don't know what I will do if I lose someone very close to me, I have no idea what the hell I'm going to do for my art project, I don't know what I'm doing the rest of the weekend if anyhting, I don't know whats going to happen after my senior year, I don't know where I can go to be happy, I don't know who or what to believe, I don't know why I feel like this all the time, I don't know who&nbsp;people really are,&nbsp;I don't know who I can&nbsp;fully trust, I don't know who is telling me the truth,&nbsp;I don't know why I can't get the one thig I really want, and I don't know when all the madness is going to stop! I just don't know!&nbsp; Ugh, I wish I was the person that could just go up so someone and tell them whats up, but I can't, I just can't do that. I can say that wasting&nbsp;1/4 of gas just driving around by myself listining to the Postal Service didn't help to help me figure anything out, so I pretty much blew 1/4 tank of, like $10 that I paid for that 1/4 of a tank, and about an hour of my life.

I think that I scared myself more sitting in the car cause that town was creepy, no one around, creepy shadows in the windows, random sounds. I kinda regret not going in, but maby next time when the floors aren't covered with mud.&nbsp; My favorite part was sleeping in the van, haha, I was so freakin cold though. If I rolled over too much, well, I'd be on the floor and I would have hit Keri in the head with my foot, sooo I couldn't move too much.&nbsp;So this was my day....</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12:00pm- woke up</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat around, took a shower, got ready</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela picked me, Christina, and Lindsey up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taco Bell/KFC-mmm popcorn chicken</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat at Chris's house for a long while, funny pictures, seat belt haha</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started&nbsp;to meet up with people</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally started the 45 min. journey to Maysville- hmm, N'Sync, Britney Spears what? crazy truck trying to rape us hahaha, it was going for you Angela, haha</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got to the Hospital, chickened out, sat in the car w/Keri</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took the 45 min. journey home, I drove Angela's car</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wal-Mart Parking lot, shopping carts, brownies, Lindsey and I almost flying out of the van, Chris with a &nbsp;cape, hmmm, lots of fun</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDonalds Parking lot, food, Aaron Moore, apple juice, hitting my head on Angelas's Car</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting outside Kelly and Molly's house</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kroger, pillow</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again at Kelly's house, Sleeping in a van, very cold, woke up 5 times</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;~~ So, unless you were there, you can't fully know what went on, that will be a memory that I keep for a long time and when I'm&nbsp;30 and married and have kids, I'll tell my parents and they&nbsp;won't be able to do anything about&nbsp;it, haha,&nbsp;&nbsp;but OMG, it was so much fun, I love staying out all night, only next time I don't want to sleep in a car w/o a blanket.</P>"

"event","<P>Hmmm, first day of school. It didn't feel like the first day, it felt like I had been there for months already. It's not like I had a hard day. </P>
<P>Foods- Listened to Mrs. Dawkins tell us how she doesn't eat pop tarts and how she almost burnt down her house when she put one in the toaster when she did eat them. Learned that she has a million pets, and found out what we were going to be cooking this semester.</P>
<P>Guidence Aid- haha sat in the guidence office with Marcus and Aundria and ate cake.&nbsp;haha I get to go to the teachers lounge and get&nbsp;drinks and you don't! haha. </P>
<P>English Lit.- Listened to Mrs. Mitsch talk about how we were seniors and howw we should&nbsp;know how to yet. She had yet to say ""It's called be quiet"", but it was only the first day. Oh how&nbsp;I hope I see her purple J-Lo jump suite this year, haha. We then made some&nbsp;sort of rubric thing about chocolate chip cookies, whatever.</P>
<P>2D/3D Art- Found out that it's pretty much Art&nbsp;2 and 3 combines, both of which&nbsp;I have already taken, which means&nbsp;Mrs. Wilmhoff is going to let me do my own thing unless I want to do a project I have already done. Haha, yeah right, that really means I'll be doping a hole lot of nothing. Haha yes. But Allie is in that class only she is going to work on her AP stuff, but thats still going to be fun. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's pretty much my day, I came home and took a nap, then ate dinner.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Man, I wish it was May already and it's only been one day, 1 down 169 to go.</P>

"event","<P>I have decided that since everyone else gets to bitch at people and&nbsp;I never do, that it's my turn. You might be thinking...kim, be mean to someone?...yeah,&nbsp;I know, but i'm feeling pretty bitchy since&nbsp;I never tell anyone how&nbsp;I feel or how it is, and if i do someone ends up being mad at me for going off on someone...so...beware. If you'r my friend, then you probably have nothing to worry about but don't be surprised or think that something is wrong with me if you witness me go off on someone, I'm just letting my anger out, and boy do i have a lot of stored anger. I just don't care anymore!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks Kim </P>"

"event","<P>So I woke up at 10:00 and made a desert thing to take to my grandmas house, got a shower and sat around till 3:30. Went to my grandmas house, listened to my cousins wine about one thing or another. Saw Katie, Michelle, Anne, Ali, Max, John, and Joe, sat with them to watch the fireworks, went back to my grandmas. Watched my brother shoot off fireworks. Went to meet up with Lindsey, Austin, and Victoria at Arby's, but not for long cause they had to take Austin home. Went home, took a shower and fell asleep. Now i have to go to work, I hate getting up to go to work every freakin day of the week! Wow, was my 4th of July excieting...Not...Only good thing...I didn't have to go to work... </P>

"event","<P>What I tell my younger cousin when she is having a friend problem.... </P>
<P>Dang abby, you'r so deep., thought i do not know what happened, there are the few that you can trust, your family and some friends, unfortionetly, you have to go through hell to find the ones that you can truley trust and will still keep you'r secreats eventhough you have a falling out, if you keep everything to your self, it will hurt you in the long run. I can tell you this from experiance, i've had it happen to me (as you know) life is hard and people suck, but there are the few (though you may not have found them yet) tha you can trust. True friends won't tell secreats and won't get mad over stupid stuff, and they will be the ones that call on the weekends, and the ones that make you smile. There hard to find, but if i can find my true friends you can true (it may take a few years and a few tears but in the end it's all worth it!) &lt;3 &lt;3</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>---Maby it will help you too</P>

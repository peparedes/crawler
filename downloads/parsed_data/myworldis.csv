"event","I have this zine, it's a diary. (PS: Zine=online mag.) I don't know if I want to do it anymore. It was a big part of my summer, but I can't keep to it religiously now that I'm back in school. Well, almost. Starts Wednesday. Anyway, I'm just kinda like, ah, I don't feel like doing it anymore and people aren't participating, so I feel like I'm being under-used or something. Not appriciated. That's it. I don't feel needed/appriciated. And I need to know that. I want to know that people like me, or atleast that they don't hate me. You know how that goes. 

The other day, Craig was like, ""People don't care what you do"". Actually, first he said ""People don't care about you"" I was like, gee, thanks, I feel <i>oh-so</i> wonderful now. Geez. Then he said that they don't care what I do. He needs to just back off, I think. I don't know. I just want someone to call my own. Or something that I'm appricicated for. I just want to get wrapped up in school and concentrate on that so that I don't have to think anymore. I need to get good grades to get good classes for high school so that I can get into a good college and support myself. 

Craig said that he and Brittani were trying to set my up with this one kid. He was like, ""You have a chance with Joe."" I'm thinking, okay, Joe's nice, but he's no Brian. He definitly isn't Brian. And let me stress that last part. <b>HE IS NOT BRIAN!</b> I can't hang onto what was never there, but I still like him, a lot. I wonder if he'll be at band tomorrow. When he'll be back from vacation. I don't know. 

There are things that I want to say, but I can't say them, because they are just thought particals in my head and they don't even make sence to me, let alone to someone else. 

I think that I might end my zine. Or put it on hiatus. I can only process one thing at a time now. 

Maybe I can be like, ""Hey, Brian, remember when I asked Jess a bunch of things for you? Well, I didn't get any payback for that, and could you___for me?"" I don't know what that would be. Maybe ask if he could teach me to skateboard or something. I don't know. Or help with that band ""that he's been trying to start for a year"". I don't know again."

"event","I had the weirdest dream last night. We were at band practice, but it wasn't band. It was like a picnic at the school. It must have been like, 10 at night because it was real dark. Then we got in the semi-circle that we use to do warm-ups and we were reciting something. It was like, a weird version of Harry Potter. I don't know why, maybe because I was reading that before bed last night. Anyway, I was reading with Mary, and we didn't remember anything, so we got out the book, but she couldn't read it because she didn't have her glasses, even though she has contacts and I couldn't see it because of the light. And we didn't wanna hold it up to the street lights because we were supposed to know the words. Then all of a sudden, we were inside the school and the band room was a mess, like it is before a home game because we have to change in there. And I was in the supply room, and one of the band moms poked her head around the corner and I didn't hear what she said, but someone died and there were people around Mary. And we went to her uncle's house or something and we (me, Brad and Mary) waited around for a while and then her uncle came out and I still didn't hear who died, but I think it was her mom. I don't remember anything after that.

It was strange.

I wanna talk to Brian. I want to see him, but I don't think he'll be at practice tonight. I hope he is, even though I know he won't. It was a big mistake talking to him, because now I want to talk to him again, and I want to like him again. Weird. I wonder if he just make up ""Katie"" so that he could get me off his back. If he did, which I doubt, that's just really low."

Last night when we had band camp, the instrumentalists were on the field and the drum line were in the band room or outside of it or something to that persuasion.

A few did get by and down my face, but I don't think anyone saw. I'm still kinda coping with the fact that Brian likes someone else.

Why can't I just not like him? It's no fair. I've liked him since December. Actually, before that because I asked him out in December (3rd...) and he didn't tell me that he wouldn't go out with me until January 6th. I didn't find out until the 7th because we just moved and I didn't have the internet yet. That was my Christmas gift from him. January 6th is Russian Christmas. I was at my aunts when I checked my email.

Shoot, why am I such a freak? I can't even generate interest in me with someone who was too chicken to ask the 'other' girl if she was going out with anyone. I had to do it for him. Why? Because he asked me and I can't dissappoint someone, not even someone who turned me down. And it only took, like, 30-some days for him to get around to it. This is a very bad day. 

I want to eat, but I can't. I can't afford any more calories than I already have stored in me. I need to get a flat stomach or I just won't feel right in my own skin. Like Jennifer Grey in ""Dirty Dancing"". I just watched that and she is so skinny. It's no fair. No fair at all.

I don't care that I'm just going nuts now, I want it back. As if my plan for losing any weight has helped. I don't think I have and my abs? They are no where near flat and toned."

"event","Brian told me (through the email that I was too chicken to open...) the he hasn't talked to this one girl for a while and therefore, doesn't really like her anymore. He also told me that he night have a girlfriend by next Monday, someone who doesn't live here, but up where ever he is now, this 'camp' or something. Sucks for me, no?? Sigh, I'm very depressed right now. It's not as big a shock as other things have been, but it's still a little...whoa!!!"

I am LINUS

I am the voice of reason, even though I may be a bit shy and insecure.

I provide advice to people in need, which proves to be very helpful.

I have a strong voice and I am very opinionated.

"event","Okay, I don't wanna seem...ungrateful or anything, but I dont' really like going to church in the summer. Ours doesn't have A/C for some reason, so it's so hot, and even though we have those floor fan thingies, they just push around the hot air to make it even stuffier. Long story short (too late...) our church is SUPER hot. Sigh. 

Got an email back from Brian. It was about my freaky dream that I had and told him about. I'm too chicken to open the email, though. I guess I'm afraid that he's going to be all, ""Okay, listen, I don't like you so stop talking to me and get the hell off my back and far away from me."" I can kinda see that happening, considering some things that I don't really wanna get into. Sigh. I don't know what in the world to do. It's just so sad. Haha. I have come to the slow realisation that he will NEVER like me. It's rather sad. After all, I've hung on for, like, ever. I just need to give up, but I can't."

"event","I thought I'd write this little hypothetical scenario to help those who had never watched <em>Lost </em>understand what it felt like to be a die-hard <em>Lost</em> fan at the ending moments of the finale last night.&nbsp; I know some fans don't agree with me, but I think this will more or less sum up the feelings of the vast majority of posters I've seen online since last night.&nbsp; As always, this is just what it felt like to me.&nbsp; If you felt differently, I'm glad for you.&nbsp; I'd rather be you than me right now.<br /><br />So indulge me in a hypothetical...<br /><br />Imagine you love murder mysteries.&nbsp; You start reading a book that is touted as the great murder mystery of the ages.&nbsp; You get hooked easily in the first chapter.&nbsp; In the first few pages, the author presents you with a man's corpse.&nbsp; We don't know his identity, but we quickly learn that his life is shrouded in mystery.&nbsp; By the end of the first chapter, the author has presented us with several important questions.&nbsp; Who is this man?&nbsp; Who killed him?&nbsp; Why did they kill him?&nbsp; How did they kill him?<br /><br />You read the second chapter.&nbsp; You're presented with many characters who are somehow connected with the man.&nbsp; You get the idea that one of them (or maybe a group of them) hold all the answers.&nbsp; Continuously through the chapter, the author keeps repeating the same questions.&nbsp; Who is this man?&nbsp; Who killed him?&nbsp; Why did they kill him?&nbsp; How did they  kill him?<br /><br />The third chapter introduces more characters.&nbsp; Soon you begin to think that maybe you care more about the characters than the questions the author has posed.&nbsp; But the author is having none of it.&nbsp; He begins to pepper those questions into the body of the chapters now and not just at the end.&nbsp; You are relentlessly forced to confront the same questions.&nbsp; Who is this man?&nbsp; Who killed him?&nbsp; Why did they kill him?&nbsp; How did they  kill him?<br /><br />In the subsequent chapters, you begin to wonder if the author had the end of the book planned when he started.&nbsp; Events are muddled and characters act strangely.&nbsp; You read an interview with the author in which he assures you that he's known the ending all along.&nbsp; He promises that if you just trust him, you will know the answers to all the questions he has posed.&nbsp; He's been a good writer so far, so you trust him.&nbsp; You go back to pondering the questions.&nbsp; Who is this man?&nbsp; Who killed him?&nbsp; Why did they kill him?&nbsp; How did they  kill him?<br /><br />Finally you near the end of the book.&nbsp; There are a few subplots that begin to be wrapped up and answered.&nbsp; At the end of every paragraph you are promised by some character (or the narrator) that soon you will know the answers to all the questions.&nbsp; Who is this man?&nbsp; Who killed him?&nbsp; Why did they kill him?&nbsp; How did they  kill him?<br /><br />You have arrived at the end.&nbsp; You hold your breath and turn to the final page.&nbsp; You are about to have the answers you've been promised for so long.&nbsp; You rest your eyes upon the final page and see...<br /><br />A picture of a rabbit with a pancake on its head.<br /><br /><p>You blink in surprise.&nbsp; This wasn't at all what you'd expected.&nbsp; Underneath the picture, you find the last words of the book.&nbsp; They read:&nbsp; &quot;It turns out the answers to those questions weren't that important after all.&nbsp; Instead, enjoy the knowledge that this bunny lives in a happy home and gets plenty of carrots every day.&quot;<br /><br />Now imagine it took you SIX YEARS to read that book.<br /><br />And just for argument's sake, imagine that when you first started reading the book a bunch of people had posted online saying, &quot;I bet they never answer anything and at the end we just get a picture of a bunny.&quot;&nbsp; The author didn't take that well and responded in many interviews saying, &quot;I can assure you that we'll answer everything and there will definitely not be a picture of a bunny at the end.&quot;&nbsp; After you read the final chapter you send the author an email saying, &quot;But I thought you said they were wrong about the bunny picture.&quot;&nbsp; The author replies, &quot;Well, <em>technically</em> that's true.&nbsp; They didn't say it would be a picture of a bunny <em>with a pancake on its head</em>.&quot;<br /><br />You sit and stare at the closed book and wonder how to feel about all this.&nbsp; You might have liked the bunny ending if only the author hadn't persisted with those damned questions.&nbsp; You liked most of the book.&nbsp; It was a fun read and full of good characters.&nbsp; But when you view the story as a whole, you can't help but feel cheated and lied to by the author.<br /><br />There you have it, guys.&nbsp; Now you know what it's like to be a <em>Lost</em> fan today.</p>"

"event","Last night, I had an incredible dream.&nbsp; In it, I felt safe... comforted... at peace... special... and most importantly, loved.&nbsp; <br /><br />(And for Pete's sake, get your minds out of the gutter.&nbsp; It wasn't one of those.&nbsp; Can we move on now?&nbsp; Thanks.)<br /><br />As they are wont to do, my alarm woke me at the best part of the dream.&nbsp; So, I hit snooze and rolled over.&nbsp; I was desperate to find my way back to that place where I had all those things I feel I lack in my waking world.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; I fell asleep again and quickly resumed the dream at almost exactly the spot where I had left it.<br /><br />I replayed that little scene over the course of several hours.&nbsp; Alarm.&nbsp; Snooze.&nbsp; Dreaming.&nbsp; All to escape the bright, cold, lonely reality of my bedroom.&nbsp; I just had to return to that safe, warm, loving place for a little longer.&nbsp; Eventually, I turned off the alarm.&nbsp; I hated it for coming between me and the world I wanted.&nbsp; I returned to the dreaming intent on staying for as long as I could.<br /><br />However, this time, the dreaming was different.&nbsp; The people in it slowly turned from caring to caustic.&nbsp; What was once love had turned to scorn.&nbsp; I was confused and terrified in this new dream.&nbsp; Why had they turned on me?&nbsp; Why did these same people, who had loved me just moments before, now hate and mock me?<br /><p><br />I awoke in my bedroom.&nbsp; I was still cold and alone, but now I was depressed as well.&nbsp; What had gone wrong?&nbsp; What had happened to destroy the fantasy?<br /><br />Lying there in the harsh light of reality, I had a thought.&nbsp; We all have dreams we chase.&nbsp; But some dreams, like those we have every night, are nice, but ultimately unattainable, fantasies.&nbsp; They are great places to visit, and they can even give us respite in troubled times.&nbsp; But while the people and places in my dream were from my reality, that would never be the reality of them.&nbsp; Not understanding that, I chased the dream.&nbsp; I tried to force it to become my reality.&nbsp; The dream responded to my hubris by showing me my actual reality.<br /><br />We have to know which dreams we can chase and which should be left to those fantasies that soothe us during slumber.&nbsp; Otherwise, the harsh light of day will always find us back in our bedrooms... depressed and alone.<br /><br />Forgive me, Morpheus.</p>"

"event","<em>(Cross-posted to Facebook.&nbsp; You can comment here or there.)</em><br /><br />So earlier on Facebook, I posted the following: &quot;Conan O'Brien just made me cry.&nbsp; I didn't even cry at Johnny's last show.&quot;<br /><br />Which prompted Chris Mezzolesta to reply: &quot;You might possibly have been a little young to understand the impact that Carson had on entertainment as a whole.&quot;<br /><br />Now, no offense at all to Chris (who is a good friend and I know meant no disrespect), but I always get mildly annoyed when people discount what I say due to my age.&nbsp; So I felt that I had to let you all in on exactly what this whole situation means to me, personally.<br /><br />I've always had problems being a &quot;day person.&quot; I've never had what most would consider a &quot;normal&quot; sleep cycle.&nbsp; My parents had a saying when I was young: &quot;You can put her to bed, but you can't put her to sleep.&quot;&nbsp; Eventually, they learned that without something to distract me, I would stay up singing or playing with toys and would keep them up as well.&nbsp; So they caved in and gave me a small black-and-white TV in my room.&nbsp; <br /><br />This meant, unlike many people my age, that Johnny Carson was a massive part of my childhood.&nbsp; I watched him most nights thanks to that little TV.&nbsp; Sometimes I'd watch with my father if there was an interesting guest or something he wanted to use as a learning tool (my father has always been an educator 24/7).&nbsp; So when Carson retired, I knew pretty well what was going on and the implications of the whole thing.&nbsp; I was sad to see Carson go, and the emotions that went with watching that last show are still fresh in my mind all these years later.&nbsp; Thinking of Bette's rendition of &quot;One For My Baby&quot; sitting on that desk still gets me all warm and fuzzy and nostalgic in all the right ways.<br /><br />But Conan has been a much bigger part of my life for much longer.&nbsp; And I feel connected to him in a way that I never did with Carson.&nbsp; I will grant that some of that is due to my age, yes.&nbsp; But Conan always felt like one of my best friends.&nbsp; He was geeky, witty, and smart.&nbsp; He spoke to me in a way Carson never could.&nbsp; He'd come from SNL (another HUGE part of my childhood) during some of its final good years, and had written for Simpsons during some of their best.&nbsp; His humor was mine.<br /><br /> I never liked Leno nearly as much, despite his frequent guest-host appearances.&nbsp; I watched a bit when he took over.&nbsp; I liked some of the bits (like Headlines).&nbsp; But he never really spoke to me.&nbsp; I had given up on the Tonight Show under Leno's reign even as a kid.&nbsp; I would switch to Nick At Nite instead.&nbsp; But a few months in, I caught one of Conan's early shows.&nbsp; I'll grant he was pretty rough in the beginning.&nbsp; But even at that age, I knew I liked him.&nbsp; He quickly became appointment watching for me.&nbsp; So while the Tonight Show faded from my life, Late Night rolled in to fill that spot.&nbsp; Conan was my favorite late night host.&nbsp; Letterman had some funny stuff.&nbsp; Leno did, too.&nbsp; But Conan was MY host.<br /><br />So for 17 years, I watched Late Night with Conan O'Brien.&nbsp; I loved all the bits.&nbsp; He always felt like more of Carson's successor to me than Leno (although Carson himself was said to have believed that title belonged to Letterman).&nbsp; So when they announced years ago that Conan would eventually get the Tonight Show, I was ecstatic.&nbsp; It felt like I'd been waiting since I was a kid for this to happen.&nbsp; And in a very real sense, I had been.&nbsp; I was thrilled to have the show that was such a huge part of my childhood feel like it was mine again.&nbsp; And for 7 months, I felt that same thrill watching it.<br /><br />And now that is gone.&nbsp; See, I'm not mad at NBC for bad programming or horrible judgment (although all that is true and does annoy me greatly).&nbsp; I'm mad that they took away that part of my childhood... again.&nbsp; And after tonight, the Tonight Show goes back to being that disappointment that made me lose interest even at such a young age.&nbsp; They hurt MY host.&nbsp; They killed his dream... and mine, too.&nbsp; They let vindictiveness and greed win out over hard work and kindness.&nbsp; And they've left that part of me that still longs for the good old days wonder if the Tonight Show will ever feel like my home again.<br /><br />John Hodgman sent out a message tonight on Twitter that read: &quot;Saying farewell to an entertainer. Jocks win. This time.&quot;&nbsp; That's what it feels like to all of us who watched Conan and felt he spoke for us.&nbsp; NBC has put us back on the playground to suffer those same petty injustices that made childhood hell.<br /><br />But Conan's final words tonight were of grace.&nbsp; He got to live that dream for a few months, and I got to live it with him.&nbsp; And once again, I am 10 years old watching a cynical, spiteful, intelligence-insulting, big-chinned loudmouth steal a part of my childhood from me.<br /><br />And that's what really made me cry tonight.<br />"

&quot;Booze Run&quot;
by Kiki

(TTTO: &quot;Swanee&quot; by Gershwin/Caesar)

I haven't touched you in a long time
I've missed your sweet and warming glow
That joy oh so dear
When downing a beer
Too rare it's come to be
I've been too poor to grab a Mike's Lime
A shot of vodka or some sloe
But payday is due
I'm coming for you
Liquor, you're calling me

Booze Run
How I need to
How I need to
Go on a Booze Run
Oh how I'd love to be
So lovely drunk off B-O-O-Z-
E-ven now there's Fundies
Trying to destroy my pleasure
But they can bite me
Sobriety will fly out the door
When I get to that liquor store"

"event","So, as most of you know, I moved to Illinois four months ago with a simple dream:&nbsp; to find a job and not have to return to Georgia.<br /><p>After a rocky start due to all the wonders of un-medicated bipolar, I finally got the ball rolling.&nbsp; I signed up for help from DuPage County (which is the most affluent in all of IL as it turns out).&nbsp; Through their wealth of programs, I was able to get a steady psychiatrist, regular medication, a job coach to help me look for work, and quite a few other things as well.<br /><br />When Sara bought a house (yay!) and decided to have her wonderful fiance Luke move in (also yay!), that sort of left me with no place to go.&nbsp; However, things once again took an upward swing as I was able to find a job.&nbsp; It's only a part time, minimum wage cashier job and it's only guaranteed to be seasonal, but it is far better than the nothing I had before.&nbsp; With a job, I started to hunt for a place to live.<br /><br />I needed a few things in a new place.&nbsp; I needed it to have a roommate I could tolerate (naturally).&nbsp; I needed it to be between $400-500/mo after including utilities (which must include internet as well).&nbsp; I needed it to be near public transportation.&nbsp; Finally, I needed it to be in DuPage County so I could keep all the services I was getting.<br /><br />Things did not go well at first.&nbsp; None of the posters on Craigslist with places that met my needs ever contacted me back.&nbsp; Finally, a girl named Amber gave me a call.&nbsp; I met with her and found that her place had everything I wanted (including laundry on site!).&nbsp; She's a geek herself and has two cats.&nbsp; We hit it off immediately.&nbsp; She wanted me as her roomie, but I had to undergo a background/credit check before her landlord would let me move in.<br /><br />Today, after much stress and uncertainty, I got the news that I was approved to be her new roommate!&nbsp; I get to stay in IL!&nbsp; I get to start my new job this coming week!&nbsp; I get to keep my doctor, my meds, and all my services from DuPage!<br /><br />Best of all... I DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO GEORGIA!!!!!!!!!ONE!!!11!<br /><br />Over half of my stuff (well, the stuff in IL at least) has already been moved into the new place.&nbsp; Amber is coming in the morning to help me move the rest of my clothes and small things.&nbsp; Luke will help me move my futon, dresser, and computer on Monday.&nbsp; By Monday night, I'll be in the new apartment.&nbsp; The first week will be a bit hectic.&nbsp; Amber's old roomie (who is breaking her half of the lease and leaving Amber in a bind) can't have her stuff out until the 3rd.&nbsp; So, I can't have my bedroom until then.&nbsp; Also, there is another girl staying in Amber's room right now.&nbsp; She was going to be the new roommate, but she couldn't live with cats.&nbsp; She is getting out by the 1st.&nbsp; So, for a few days, I will be sleeping on the couch, and there may be four of us in a two bedroom apartment.&nbsp; However, since this is an inconvenience from hell (and since the landlord is forcing the old roomie to pay October's rent), Amber has offered to just let me split half of her rent for the month.&nbsp; Since I'm only paying half of what I planned to this month, I'll be able to furnish my room a bit more and get some things I need for the winter (like a decent coat).&nbsp; So, I'm willing to go through an odd week.<br /><br />There's much more to this story.&nbsp; I've been through many ups and downs and lots of stress.&nbsp; However, I don't really want to dwell on that at the moment.&nbsp; For this short span, everything is working out for me even if it hasn't worked out exactly like I'd imagined.&nbsp; I am determined to focus on the good.&nbsp; I shall keep looking for a steady job in my field that pays me more than the minimum.&nbsp; I have a few leads and am always looking for more.&nbsp; (If you know of any jobs for someone with a writing/linguistics/tutoring/theatre background in the area, let me know.)<br /><br />The universe has been kind to me.&nbsp; As such, I will refrain from setting it on fire... for now.<br /><br />(P.S.&nbsp; If you're in the Chicagoland area and we haven't gotten to hang out yet, send me a private message with how to contact you.&nbsp; I want to hang out with more friends.)</p>"

"event","Yeah, fine.&nbsp; I watch American Idol.&nbsp; I watch it because I like Simon Cowell.&nbsp; Yes, I know what you all think of him.&nbsp; I know it's on Fox.&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp; I still don't care.&nbsp; Let's move beyond the harassment and get to business shall we?<br /><br /> I would like to take you back to 2003.&nbsp; Two hopeful young male singers stand on a stage waiting for Ryan &quot;The More I See of Ant &amp; Dec, The More I Hate Him&quot; Seacrest to announce which one of them would be the next winner of American Idol.&nbsp; Clay Aiken was the obvious choice.&nbsp; He was the better performer and the more outstanding vocalist.&nbsp; He had never been in the Bottom Three, the weekly group that get the lowest numbers of votes.&nbsp; He had a huge fanbase.&nbsp; However, when Seacrest made the announcement, we were told that his competition, Ruben Studdard, was the ultimate winner.&nbsp; Studdard won the competition by 130,000 votes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many fans were shocked.&nbsp; How had Ruben beat out such obviously superior competition in the end?&nbsp; Many theories were put forward at the time.&nbsp; The most lingering of these is the idea that there was an error with the phone lines that caused possibly millions of Clay's votes not to be recorded.&nbsp; However, the more likely scenario is that Clay lost because...<br /><br />He had teh icky gay!&nbsp; *insert scary fanfare here*&nbsp; *also insert lightning and thunder*&nbsp; *and let's toss in some poor female screaming*&nbsp; *and how about some demonic laughter at the end, too*<br /><br />Questions about Clay's sexuality were prevalent from the moment America first saw him.&nbsp; And, let's be honest here, it was obvious all along.&nbsp; However, all through the second season of American Idol, Clay maintained that he loved him some girls.&nbsp; Even after he left the show and went on to decimate Studdard in albums sales, Aiken continued to deny his sexuality.&nbsp; In fact, it was only last year that Clay finally decided to be truthful with the public and officially came out.<br /><br />But it seems he came out long before that.&nbsp; Former second season contestants have since claimed that Aiken told them was gay during the filming of the show.&nbsp; It seems the producers knew as well.&nbsp; So why was he so obscure with the public for so long?&nbsp; It seems former Idol contestants may provide the answer to that as well.&nbsp; A few former Idol hopefuls have said that Fox <em>encouraged</em> them to deflect questions about their sexuality during their time on the show.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, this occured with Clay Aiken as well.<br /><br />So why all this backstory tonight, dear friends?&nbsp; Well, if any of you have been keeping up with this season of Idol, you'll know that we're in a similar situation again.&nbsp; Tonight's grand finale will give us a new American Idol.&nbsp; This time the competition has come down to Adam Lambert vs. Kris Allen.<br /><br />Kris Allen is a cute, shy, sweet southern boy from Arkansas.&nbsp; He plays guitar and piano.&nbsp; His lovely wife sits in the audience during every show to cheer him on.&nbsp; He has a very subdued performance style.&nbsp; He's a nice singer, someone I'd love to have with me at karaoke.<br /><br />Adam Lambert is an amazing singer and a brilliant performer.&nbsp; He knows how to use the tools he is given.&nbsp; He is from California.&nbsp; He has a background in theatre and has appeared in musicals professionally before.&nbsp; He also made a living as a performer at caberet shows.&nbsp; He knows how to dress.&nbsp; His hair is black and blue, and he rocks emo bangs with a punk twist.&nbsp; His nails are painted, and he wears more makeup than Idol judge Paula Abdul.<br /><br />To put it mildly, Adam Lambert just may be the gayest gay that ever gayed a gay.&nbsp; And I love him for it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like all gay Idol contestants, he has been forced to deflect those nagging questions about his sexuality.&nbsp; But, unlike Clay Aiken, he has never denied that he is gay.&nbsp; He just takes the Anderson Cooper route.&nbsp; When pictures of him kissing another man surfaced, Adam confirmed that they were of him and said that he had nothing to hide about his life.<br /><div><br />When my Simon (boo and I'll hurt you) was asked by TV Guide about Adam Lambert's constant deflections of the gay question, he said:</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"">&quot;I think people only get bothered really when they know somebody&rsquo;s hiding something. [Laughs] We&rsquo;ve had that in the past! <em>(Note: Read Clay Aiken here.)</em>&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve obviously never had an issue with it <em>(Note: I assume this means the judges and Simon's co-creator Simon Fuller and does not extend to Rupert Murdoch and Fox.)</em>, and nor should anybody else. It&rsquo;s a huge step forward for the show. It&rsquo;s just, do you like him as a person, as a singer, full stop.&quot;<br />&nbsp;</div><div>But have we, as my Simon suggests, moved forward?&nbsp; Many Right Wing nut-job groups have already formed online to encourage their followers to vote for anyone but Adam Lambert.&nbsp; They don't think he casts the right image for an &quot;American&quot; Idol.&nbsp; Simon Cowell himself has even gone on record saying that if Adam made the finals, he didn't think he would win.&nbsp; Simon figured that either Kris Allen or third place contestant Danny Gokey would triumph because they were the &quot;safe&quot; choice, although he admits that Adam Lambert is the better singer.<br /><br />So has America moved past our problems with teh icky gay?&nbsp; Or is it, as my Simon seems to suggest, that we only had a problem with Clay Aiken because he was lying to us?&nbsp; If this is true, why doesn't Simon think Adam is the &quot;safe&quot; choice?<br /><br />After last night's final performance, I spent an hour and ten minutes on the phone dialing the three numbers provided for Adam Lambert.&nbsp; In that time, I got through 40 times.&nbsp; Well, there's my word on the subject.&nbsp; 40 votes for the better singer.<br /><br />Adam Lambert doesn't need to win American Idol.&nbsp; His career is assured.&nbsp; I know that Simon Cowell has already figured out the rest of this boy's life.&nbsp; If Adam's smart, he won't fight it.&nbsp; He'll be a millionaire by the end of the year.&nbsp; He'll be able to tour, star on Broadway, or whatever he desires.&nbsp; But, if he wins, it may just show that Americans are on their way to forgetting about teh icky gay and seeing people like Adam as a person, as a singer, full stop.<br /><br />Go Adam!<br /><br />(Final note:&nbsp; Comments may contain spoilers for the final results starting around 10 pm Eastern.&nbsp; If you don't want to see them, stop looking around this time.)<br />&nbsp;</div>"

At the start of April, I took a really crappy job under a horrifically ass-tastic manager for the sole purpose of saving money to move at the end of summer.  Well, the job turned out to be an April Fool's joke as I was fired on my third day of employment for offering to work MORE hours.  It seems this was somehow &quot;disrespectful&quot; to my manager since he makes the schedule, and therefore meant that I was questioning his authority.  I was confused.<br /><br />Anyway, after Operation Save Money and Move at Summer's End blew up in my face in a spectacular fashion unfortunately totally unlike the nifty Mythbusters 'splosions, I came to a decision.<br /><br />It's time to GTFO.<br /><br />I have been offered a place to stay with the lovely <a href=""http://dement1a.livejournal.com/profile""><img height=""17"" width=""17"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://dement1a.livejournal.com/""><b>dement1a</b></a> at her place in <strong>Chicago!</strong>  I'll stay with her while I locate a job and save up the money for my own place.  The ever puntherific <lj user=""kerish""/>  has agreed to be my roomie once we save enough to move into an apartment.<br /><br />The date for the move is now targeted for the <strong>week of May 5th</strong> or as soon after as I can arrange a flight.  I know it's soon, but I need out ASAP.  There's no future for me here.<br /><br />Those of you in Georgia get ready to say farewell.  Those of you in Chicago... Ferret's a'comin your way!<br /><br />Love and huggles!<br /><br />(P.S. I don't usually do this, but if any of you would like to donate to my moving fund, please do so through paypal to the address kiki@voiceofkiki.com with whatever you feel like giving. I've discovered some quite important things I lack for a trip/move like this. I don't even own a suitcase. I hate to ask, but there it is.)<br />"

He does not see the same world you and I see. In his world we are better than we are, we care more than we care. We act towards each other with compassion. I much prefer his world to that of my own, and I will not allow anything to threaten that.<br /><br />Stephen Colbert, shortly after the election, asked how science fiction would show people that we're in the future if America really does have a black president.&nbsp; Well, my friends...&nbsp; <br /><br />Welcome to the future.&nbsp; May it be all we know it can and should be.<br /><br />Love, huggles, and hope,<br />Kiki<br /><br /><br />What thoughts do you have on this historic day?&nbsp; Also, who are your favorite movie presidents?&nbsp; Mine has to be Bill Pullman as President Thomas Whitmore in <em>Independence Day</em>.&nbsp; That final speech can rouse the patriot in me in a way few things can."

"event","I'm in the midst of a quite hellish week.&nbsp; I'm trying to get everything done so that I can pass my classes so that I can graduate so that I won't have to do this crap anymore.&nbsp; I have 2 papers, 2 portfolios, 3 revisions, 1 quiz, and various other homework due before Friday.&nbsp; I also have to find time to work on a majorly difficult painting.&nbsp; 

Oh, and I have rehearsals.&nbsp; Can't forget about those.

I will mention a few things here.&nbsp; When I'm stressed, I can't eat.&nbsp; Plus, I am hypoglycemic.&nbsp; My blood sugar drops when I don't eat and when I'm forced to do strenuous activity.&nbsp; Also, my part in the play is VERY physical.

We ran the entire play THREE times tonight.&nbsp; Back-to-back.&nbsp; The only &quot;break&quot; was to get notes and reset.

I made my final exit (which signals the play's end) and heard the director call &quot;scene.&quot;&nbsp; The next thing I remember is Kenneth in my face looking quite worried and shaking me.&nbsp; I was on the floor.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; I passed out.&nbsp; When they figured out what was wrong with me, they got me a quick snack to bring my blood sugar up a bit.&nbsp; Then Kenneth walked me across the parking lot to the Wendy's and sat with me while I got something more substantial.

I'm fine now.&nbsp; I'm exhausted and stressed, though.&nbsp; I may take a nap.&nbsp; I have to revise 3 pieces and prepare my portfolio for Creative Writing tomorrow.&nbsp; I also have to study for a quiz in the morning.&nbsp; A nap may be a good idea.

Two good things came from the crap that was tonight, though.&nbsp; Firstly, I made it through rehearsal and only passed out once the director called scene.&nbsp; I think that says something about my professionalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I got to&nbsp;have a nice chat with&nbsp;Kenneth while I&nbsp;ate.&nbsp; That cheered me greatly.&nbsp; I'm so lucky to have a friend like him.&nbsp; I can't thank him enough.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp;"

<lj-cut text=""Pics or it didn't happen..."">
<img style=""width: 383px; height: 323px"" alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/2973378747_cce7c205a2_o.jpg"" />.

Yup.  That's me and Jonathan and cake!  That's actually my birthday cake.  I bought that one slice from some supermarket near Chris and Sora's (<lj user=""darthparadox"">  and <lj user=""nightsinger"">) house.  I never get birthday cake unless I buy it for myself.  Since I have to be lame and buy it for myself, I figure I can at least eat it with cool people.  

But there is one hitch...

<img style=""width: 397px; height: 372px"" alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/3061602388_5d5484eb14_o.jpg"" />

Ok, I know it's Jonathan.  He's awesome.  He would never hurt me.  Also, I know full well that I purchased this cake myself.  Still... I just can't trust cake anymore.  And we all know whose fault that is...

Only one way to get me to trust this cake...

<img style=""width: 401px; height: 360px"" alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3246/3061602570_441d56bf9e_o.jpg"" />

It's kinda like being a food tester... But for cake.  Sadly, this cake was pretty lousy.  But, hey!  It was my birthday dammit!  So Jonathan was going to eat that cake.  He's such a sweetheart.

I fully approve (and Jonathan has given permission) for these pics to be duly mocked on <lj user=""dementia_macros"">  or what-have-you.  The full-size photos are available on <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/voiceofkiki"">my Flickr page</a>.

Also, please give mucho props to <lj user=""budsharpe"">  for making the amazing new icon.  (Also, any other icon ideas you guys feel like whipping up are more than welcome.)  Getting these pics was a challenge, but a fun one.  Jonathan actually stopped his very swamped merch table line to partake in this bit of silliness with me.  He then gave me hugs and chatted for a bit.  All while making the fanboys wait.  I could feel their jealousy wafting my direction.  Way to make a ferret feel special, Jonathan.  *squee*</lj-cut>

And this is why we all love JoCo.  <3"

It is a joy!&nbsp; He's so thoughtful as an actor that he makes it easy for you to just lose yourself in the character and the moment.&nbsp; It is absolutely awe-inspiring to work opposite someone with that level of talent.&nbsp; I relish every second of it.&nbsp; I never knew how rewarding it could be to share a stage with someone of that caliber.&nbsp; I'll always be grateful to him for giving me this chance.<br /><br />I know many people told me I was crazy to take on this show instead of taking the easy way out and just writing a paper or something for the final project.&nbsp; You know what, though?&nbsp; I wouldn't trade this experience for anything."

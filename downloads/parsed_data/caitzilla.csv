"event","I've just recently decided that I really can't trust anyone. Even the ones you expect not to bullshit you do. I wonder why the FUCK people say things they don't mean. Why? Can anyone fucking answer that? Are you too big of a pussy to come clean and tell me exactly what you want or don't want? I like being able. for the most part, to decide what I want. Why are other people afraid to take a step into life? Breaking away from the norm can do you some good. I could give a rats ass if my entries sound retarded or emo. They are MINE. What makes yours better? Using a larger vocabulary? Anyone who has a dictionary can achieve that. It's what you write. How you feel you need or can relieve some of your tension and stress in life. If there is no one in your life otherwise that you feel you can confide in. Who would be quicker to listen than to speak. Very few of those out here. I'm sick of the bullshit. People need to come clean. My largest vulnerability is that I trust too much, and care as well. Grr.."

------------------------------------------------

Things are starting to come together in my mind and make sense. For once in a long time. It sometimes takes a while to see clearly, but once you do it feels like a stone to your skull. Some of the thoughts kill your mind with their intensity, but sleeping it off helps. Right? ;) It has just struck me that I need to get my affairs in order and deal with the things that need to be dealt with. I can either stop the ruin or let it rot and decay past repair. What would you do? Would you wait it out while using the exact same methods as before? Give up? Change your ways? The end is the beginning is the end. Maybe the chaos will cease. Maybe I will get smarter and stop jumping into shitty situations. Who knows. That is what I am striving for. I already have all of the help I would ever need. :)(Means alot to me. I appreciate it and treasure the friendships :)). BUT, even if you acquire the help you still need to strengthen yourself and not assume they will be your crutch forever. 

Two months and some odd days left before I leave for basic. It is actually exciting. I love to be challenged. My dad thinks that unless I start hard core working out now I won't make it. He is a stupid gym nazi. For me, my mentality is the only thing I have to overcome when it comes to running and what not. Giving up is weak and leaves you with a shitty feeling thereafter. You can't always fix things though. That is one important lesson that I need to learn. I guess i'm quite naive. ?. I have come a long way from what and who I used to be though. I have made the changes. Normally I am strong enough to where I don't need anyones help.

If someone asks you what you think of them, do you lie and tell them what they want to hear? OR are you honest even though you may be chastised for it soon after? Something i've been curious about. Also why people don't say what they mean in other situations. Or what they really want..? Why is it hard?"

"event","Well. I've thought about things today. I really would like for James to get better and maybe even grow to love himself. If he feels that he can't do that with me around then so be it. I lost sight of his best interests and became more in tune with  my own. I know that may mean the love we have now will/could be lost, but if in the long run it benefits his well being. That is what is most important to me. Sure, it hurts more than anything imaginable, BUT i'm willing to make the sacrifice. I just hope that he will really put things in motion. I want to help him, but I figure by giving him this choice I am. I love him dearly and will hold him in my heart no matter what."

"event","I hate feeling shitty and like things are falling apart. This empty feeling is just growing every time we get on bad terms. I wish it was alot easier to be happy with someone. I know it wasn't supposed to be just a smooth ride. I just get so stressed out and I feel like I don't have an outlet or anyone to talk to that will actually listen to me. :(. Problems need to be solved or atleast worked on. Leaving them as they are only prolongs the pain for one if not both sides. Maybe i'm just very sensitive. Who knows. Sometime I just feel like i'm the only one working on things. I know that isn't true, but I can't help but to feel somewhat alone.

I'm confident that things will get better. The main thing is the trust issue. I hope that is solved before we get married because that is most of the strain between us. I just wish he would just set jealousy aside and give himself a chance to trust me. I'm not like the others. He should have realized that by now. I love him to death and would never hurt him. I just hope it doesn't take too much longer to trust me. I wish he would atleast trust me to go hang out with Cindy and not feel bad before or after the fact. Like I said I love him to death. Nothing will change that, i'll just have to work at it more.

"event","I got a job. I know I should've written about it a few days ago when I first got it, but oh well. I like it though. The only part that bothers me is standing in one place for so long. The people have been nice to me too. The only one i've actually had any problem with was Jessica. She isn't a good teacher. I learned more today from Amy than I did all day from her. I honestly feel like I have lost all of my friends. I hate it. I mean everyone was doing their own thing anyway I guess.

I wonder if things will change when I get into the military. When I get married. I would rather have that someone trust me by the time (?) we get married. There have been a few times when I questions his loyalty, but I get over it. All I say is cheating is cheating. Verbally and physically. If you have impure thoughts keep them in your head, once they get out it is all down hill from there. I don't have any because I only want him. Lol, unless you count the thoughts I have about him. :). 

I meant to write this first, but yes my friend Garrett did die. His funeral is for sure on Saturday, and i'm going no matter what. As far as I have heard his parents are going to try and keep it short and sweet. Derric's mom has other plans. I think no matter what led them to be dead, they still deserve to be remembered. Everyone serves some sort of purpose in life. Maybe dying was his to teach all of my other friends that excessive drinking or drugs can really fuck up your life or end it. I don't know how many of them took that to heart or saw it that way, but that is how I perceive it. For some reason that Staind song ""Outside"" reminds me of Garrett. Makes me sad. I know James doesn't agree with my feelings, but I don't care. They are mine. If everyone was meant to feel the same then God would have made it that way. 

You know before Garrett died, I didn't really believe in death. Family members would die, but i'd never seen their bodies. When he died it was a bit of an eye opener. I think everything is questionable. I'm not normally one to need hard evidence, but in some cases I won't believe it until I see it or until it happens to me. May sound stupid, but it seems logical to me. 

Lately my thoughts have felt so constricted. I think I may be afraid to think certain things for fear of making others unhappy. I don't feel like I have control of myself anymore. I hate that feeling. I will do what I can until it subsides though. I've overcome so much in the past that this will be nothing. People may think i'm weak just because i'm good-natured and nice, but they are sadly mistaken. People try to read others and think they have them all figured out. Like I have said in the past, if you think you have someone entirely figured out you are just fooling yourself. Over-estimating can be your biggest downfall. You'll be sadly disappointed or suprised. Just because I am the way I am doesn't mean I will never be mean. I have a bad temper, but I have mastered the art of self-control. Whenever I do feel like i'm going to lose it I just separate myself from people. Unless they really deserve it that is, or no one else has the balls to stand up. I used to be the person that never stood up, but middle school changed me. I never realized there could be so many moronic assholes in one place."

Shutting them away won't work this time, 
Taking responsibility gets more difficult, 
Realizing everything doesn't spring from your faults, 
Pressure builds as the time draws near, 
In trying times I only perservere,
Walking the line my feet drag slightly,
Not knowing if you will be here to stand by me,
My heart crumbles as I fear for the worst,
Are you indecisive or am I just cursed?
Holding my head up I go day to day,
Smiling generically as if on display,
Pulling together to make myself whole,
It is a challenge, but not impossible."

God.. i wish we could be as secure as the people who go to church every
day of the week.. its amazing how they are so secure in their faith by
reading from a book.. maybe we should put the world in a book.. im not
sayin the bible is full of lies.. but people seem to believe what they
read.. fool the world.. some people are so desperate to see happiness
and have friends that they probably do go to church and put on a face
for people.. God is their outlet.. stress.. if you focus so much on one
thing you dont have to think about anything else.. unless youre like me
and your mind goes in every direction all at once.. its funny how most
of the time you think only about one thing but feel so many things at
once.. or vice versa for some of you.. some people say that they cant
feel.. i dont think it can be possible.. ive heard people say they dont
think about anything.. that isnt possible either though.. i dont know
how to describe it really.. but i guess ive never been able to turn my
heart or my brain off.. ive felt empty before.. but when my heart is
empty my mind is soaring.. i dunno.. lol.. when i write i go on about
all different things.. i dont try to make it pretty or make my
vocabulary larger.. shit im venting.. lol.. this is raw... so if u dont
like it or you think i have the IQ of a 2 yr old, you can go fuck
yourself lol..</p>"

"event","man.. im writing again.. i cant sleep.. o well.. this relieves stress anyway lol.. so onward through the fog.......

i think all aspects of a human are hard to understand.. life and everything in general are hard to be sure of all in themselves.. we only go by what people tell us or once again write in books.. weve developed technology, clothing, and food.. i dont understand how anything has come to be.. how they come up with bizarre names for chemicals and etc.. i dont really feel like we know anything for sure.. our education has been given to us by people who have learned from the same books as we have.. how did we form words to make sense? i think if we thought about it enough we could easily forget everything.. in a child like state once again.. maybe we were most intelligent then.. when youre in the womb no one influences you or tells you anything.. you dream your dreams and are not yet corrupted by the world.. that is the only time in life when you are your true self i figure.. from then on its just a long history of brainwashing and the ""leaders"" trying to make society their giant puppet show.. who knows.. im sure people have thought about this before.. questioned existence and all of that.. ive never been able to talk about it with anyone.. cuz they probably think its stupid.. lol.. or theyre minds dont want to register anything other than their false knowledge.. some people are fine with being oblivious to truth.. most people live out of lies anyway.. but it is kind of hard not to in a world youre not sure of.. maybe the liars are the true ones after all.. who knows.. well blah im goin to bed now.. ive written myself to sleep lol.."

"event","<p>The soft melodies of death rippling through my mind,</p>
<p>So subtle yet devastating everything they touch,</p>
<p>Feeling suddenly lost and hopeless,</p>
<p>Thinking to myself why did this have to be,</p>
<p>Although naught had ensued,</p>
<p>The daggers that were my thoughts penetrated my every being,</p>
<p>My heart was begging for life as other parts were crying for my demise,</p>
<p>Visualizing the life seeping out of you makes me want to die myself,</p>
<p>Oh how sweet death would be if it meant eternity with you.</p>"

pbg found this photo and sent it. he took it on his fancy camera that takes four frames really quickly. i was a bit shocked at the prominence of my ass, but other than that, what a find, right?
f-ing slice of life, kids.

"event","what a weekend, kids. what a weekend.

thursday, shane and co. came down from madison and we saw supersystem at the empty bottle. it was a real short and real nice time, and i always enjoy myself so much when i hang out with them. so i was thrilled to attend their show in wonder lake, IL on friday night.

what i didn't know was that 1) wonder lake is in the middle of nowhere, 2) the show was at a house, and that 3) the house would be full of high school students.  

luckily, the most unexpected evenings are generally the best. long story short, we played marco polo and slid down an indoor water slide until bedtime at 4:30 am. and it had been so long since i'd been to a party where boys and girls wrestled out of pure sexual tension. sigh, those were the days.

unluckily, i had to wake up at 8am on saturday to drive to iowa, where i saw my grandmother for exactly one hour before she headed back to chicago. i took a nap and then got my sisters out on the town at the town and country mini mall in cedar rapids for some good old-fashioned 21st birthday celebracion. my father drove us and picked us up. my mother paid for drinks. 

i blew a tire on the way home last night, which sucked. now i'm driving my mother's car, which is cool because there's a functioning music system. 

i think i'm getting another cold. but at least i'll be coughing in a saab."

"event","i saw devil in a woodpile at the hideout last night with poppy, jenny, kemi, and ben (and later laura and her friend from boston). nothing makes me feel happy like dirty bluegrass.

if you're looking for a belated birthday present for me, a washboard is what i want. bad. or an autoharp."

"event","than a surprise day off?

only a surprise pay check, i guess. 

i no longer have an excuse for not going to the gym today. which is good. and i will maybe even get to the grocery, which is also good. 

today is my little sisters' 21st birthday and i feel all grown up about it. mother hen will have to rest easy knowing that their boyfriends are meeting my grandmother tonight, and if that doesn't make them a-okay, then those little chicks will have someone with greater authority than i to answer to.

"event","last night we saw a car on fire. it was parked on thomas, near wood. jenny and kemi and i were walking home from pizza metro and saw it and stood and watched for a second with the other four people and the dog who were also watching it. they were, presumably, waiting for the proper authorities to arrive. none of them were, presumably, the owner of the car, as they were all very calm and in awe of the situation. kemi asked if we were in paris or what. i'm real glad it wasn't my car. and that my car was not parked in the vicinity, as i'm sure that burning oil smell is a real bitch to get out of the apholstery. i have no idea how a parked car starts on fire. 

i'm reading carole maso's _ghost dance_ and it's clearly making me crazy. i cried on page 3 or so. jenny thought i was on the brink of tragedy and told me my energy was ""very erratic."" this made me feel like i was, in fact, coo-coo. despues, i had a very nice round of drinks with tim, who inspired me to overconsume and gave me an album by the strokes, who were much discussed when we worked together. additionally, the inner town pub a) makes a great whiskey and ginger ale and b) plays an awesome monday evening soundtrack - like, what i would play if i were in charge of music at a bar - what more can you ask for from a neighborhood bar?

where does a girl in chicago get herself regularly serviced with bleu-cheese-stuffed olives in her dirtiest of vodka martinis? alternately, will any place (aside from my apartment) furnish me with the muddiest of coffees?

my week looks like i'm trying to keep myself busy. who am i to complain?"

"event","Well nothing has been going on really...just school of course. Last Friday Shawna came over and we got ready for the game together:) We lost though...16-9 or something like that against Reynolds. I pretty much forget everything that happened every other day, ha...guess it wasn't that exciting then, huh?! Anywaysss...so yesterday it rained ALL day and Butler County was in a state of emergency, 79 was shut down, and almost all of the roads in Pittsburgh were closed BUT as gay as Slippery Rock is...we had a football game in the monsoon! So we had to wear our black jazz pants, coats, and the gay ass band rain coats. But me and Shawna made the best of it and sang songs and huddled together because it was freezing. I got to see Culp...probably for the last time before he goes to Basic Training for the Marines. It was the coolest thing ever watching the football boys slide in the mud puddles on the field, hahaha. But yeah we beat Sharon 35-14...it was an awesome game. So I came home and changed and all that and went to bed. Josh called me this morning and told me that his flight had been delayed and he was in Washington D.C. and he would probably be in Pittsburgh around 12. So I went back to sleep and he called me around 12:20 and told me he was in Pittsburgh on his way home. So yeah...I'm gonna be hanging out with him for the weekend:) So I got up and got online and my doorbell rings...I'm like, uhh I'm not expecting anyone? So I open the door and its ERIC AND AARON!!!!!!!! Oh man that made my day. So they came in and Eric told me that he was getting his senior pictures at 1 so he asked me to do his hair. So we put mousse in it and I scrunched it since he has a perm, then he changed into his dress clothes. Aww he looked soooo cute:) Then they left and I gave them both hugs. TODAY IS AARON'S BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!! I love him:) But anyways...I need to shower and shit before Josh gets here, ha. So I'm out. Peace."

"event","<P><U><STRONG>Saturday</STRONG></U>- I woke up at 5:30 and took a shower and made sure I had everything I needed for Seattle. Then my daddy got here at 6:30...him and Ryan took me to the airport. We stopped at McDonalds so I could get food before my 4 1/2 hour flight. I got to the airport around 7:45 and my dad could only walk with me to the security place so I said thank you and good-bye to him and Ryan. Then I went to my gate and waited for my plane. We boarded around 9 and actually left at 9:30. I had a window seat as usual...I sat beside a married couple. On the way there we flew over Yosemite National park, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, the Snake River, and Mount Rainier. Mount Rainier is maybe 20 minutes from Seattle so we were reallyyyy close to it. Then I arrived at the Seattle airport at 11:30...2:30 our time. I went to baggage claim and Joshua was waiting for me:) We waited for my luggage then we went to his base. We went to the base hotel and got a room. Then we went to his barracks and I got to see his room. His roommate went home for the weekend so I didn't get to meet him then. So we went to Migone's and they weren't home so we went to Chris's and I met him, his wife Scarlett, and they're 2 month old baby, Tamia. Then we went to the mall so I could get a cute outfit for dancing. His friend Dave Sanzavera met us there and he walked with us. I bought a skirt and Josh and I made another bear at Build-A-Bear. He named her Mia, haha. Then we went back to the hotel and got ready. We followed Dave to this girl Auni's house where I met Auni, her sister Sam, her friend Andrea, then Josh friends...Armstrong and Q.&nbsp;Then we left and went to Seattle to Studio B to go dancing. You have to be 17 to get in so we lied and said that they lost my luggage at the airport so I didn't have photo ID. Sooo I got VIP treatment...the guy walked me to the front of the line and opened the rope for me:) hahaha. Then we danced and all that jazz and went back to the base. You must be 18 to get back on base after 11...11-3 a.m. And if you're under 18 you must have someone over 21 to sign you on base. Well Josh is 18 so he couldn't sign me on and we had to wait an hour and a half to find someone 21 or over to come sign me on. So Montero and this girl, Sabrina I think, came and signed me on. Then we went to sleep. <U><STRONG></STRONG></U></P>
<P><U><STRONG>Sunday</STRONG></U>- we didn't do too much during the day. We went to Migone's and I met him, his wife Christina and their 7 week old baby boy, Aidan. We watched 8 Mile then we decided we would go walk around Seattle. So finally we got everyone gathered up and we went to Seattle. We walked around Point Square. There are so many homeless people in Seattle its unbelieveable. We walked everywhere then we went to Red Robins and ate. We didn't get back to base til 12 I think, but they let me on...they just bitched forever and told us a whole bunch of bullshit. We got back to the hotel and we went to sleep.</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Monday</U>-</STRONG>We had to check out of the hotel by 10 because they had no more rooms...all of them were booked. So I showered and packed all my stuff and we went over to Migone's and picked up him, Christina, and the baby. Then we went over to Chris's and waited for him and Scarlett to get ready then we all went to Mount Rainier. It took&nbsp; us forever to get there because we went to the Sunrise side instead of the Paradise side. We got there and went down to the water and took pictures and stuff. I think I have a picture of every angle of the Mountain, hahaha. Then we tried to get as close to the mountain as possible because on the Sunrise side you can't go directly to the mountain. Then we left and we hate a picnic at Chris's. We went to the barracks and I met some more people. Like...Alfano, Arnold and I think that was it, but I'm not sure. Then we went back to Chris's and went to sleep. </P>
<P><STRONG><U>Tuesday</U>-</STRONG> I got woken up at like 9...(Josh had to go to work) so I went over to Migone's with Scarlett and Tamia. We waited for Christina to get Aidan ready then we went to some place so Christina could pay their house bill then we went to the Commisary so we could get food to make. Then we went back to Migone's and I showered and all that and ate. Then Migone and Chris came and picked us up to go to the Deployment Ceremony. We sat on bleechers in this big green area. There were probably over a thousand deploying soldiers on the field. There were 6 platoons. I wasn't even near Josh, haha. So we sat in the heat forever and finally it was over and I couldn't find Josh or get ahold of him. So I went with Migone then Chris picked me up and I went over there and Josh finally called me. So me and Chris picked him up at his barracks. I met his roommate...Brian Curl. He was a big boy, but he was really nice. So we left and went back to Chris's and Josh changed. We had to go back to the barracks so I FINALLY got to meet Santanna...he was Josh's old roommate and the only one I ever talked to on the phone. I was so excited. Then we went to the mall and out to eat at some Chinese place. We went back to Chris's and we all went to Point Defiance. I got to touch the Pacific Ocean and I saw sea lions!!! Then we went back to Chris's and went to sleep after I made sure I had everything packed. Got up at 7:45 and Josh came back from work and took me to the airport. He had to go back to work so I had to sit at the airport alone from 10-1:45 when we finally boarded our plane. I sat beside 2 older people and I bought headphones so I could watch the movie and listen to music. We had alot of turbulance towards the end of the flight because it was raining hard in Ohio and PA. I talked to the lady beside me for like the last 45 minutes of the flight. Got to Pittsburgh and saw my mom and Glenn. Got my luggage and we left and I got Mcdonalds on the way home. When we got home I gave my mom her present and birthday card. Then I went to bed since we didn't get home til 11:30 pm. My mom let me sleep an extra hour and then I went to school. Nothing special...I didn't miss it thats for sure. Then I had rock'n-ette practice..wasn't too bad. Linds tackled me into the mud:( hahaha. Tomorrow we have a football game, Shawna is coming over after school and getting ready with&nbsp; me:) But I'm out...peace.</P>"

But whatever, you can't change people. So yeahh then I got all my stuff ready for Rock'n-ettes and went to bed. I got up this morning and got ready for school. Went to school and we had shortened periods since we had a pep assembly at the end of the day. The rock'n-ettes got to get out of class at 1:15...it was exciting. Then we went in the gym and we had to do our dance to ""Think"". Then they announced the fall sports and they had 3 tug-o-war games then we got to go home. I got all my stuff and I rode with Andie. Some of the rock'n-ettes went to Pizza Joe's in Grove City. It was funn...but I couldn't eat for shit because I didn't feel good:( Then we all went back to Casey's and watched the Little Mermaid and got ready for the game. Casey's mommy and Cori took pictures then we went to the game. I enjoyed every minute of it...it was one of the best nights of my life...I love every single rock'n-ette, its just great. We won...28-9 against Fairview...way to start off the season right boys!!!!!:) Then I went with Mike and Tom. We stopped at Sheetz so I could get a drink...and we kept the tradition going...Shawna and Kyle came in too, again!!! hahaha. I love her dearly! But yeahh then I came home and Tom and Mike hung out with me for a while then they had to leave.

<P>Tuesday I went to school...nothing exciting happened except Kirk Hines wearing a pink Abercrombie shirt and me and Casie expressing our undying love for him because of this. I came home from school and cleaned my room on and off for 4 hours. I talked online to Lindsay about hating pre-calc. and school in general. I went to bed...and woke up yesterday morning and got my ass ready for school. I went to school...again, nothing special...just school, which means work. I want to quit because I hate it. I came home, took a nap...which was supposed to only be an hour nap and ended up being 2 1/2 because I didn't wake up. I attempted my pre-calc. homework...I couldn't do it, gave up and did my Civics. I talked online and went to sleep:) Got up this morning...went to school, what do ya know! We finished our pinch pots in ceramics and we made rockets for lab in Physics. After school I had rock'n-ette practice. It was sooo hot out, but today was a good day:) Linds brought me home, but SR is sooo freaking busy so it took us forever to get to my house. I came home and changed because I was sickly sweaty and I got online. Tomorrow night is our first game:) I'm pumped. We have a pep assembly tomorrow and we have to perform...whoop whoop. At least we got our rock'n-ette shirts though:) But I'm out...peace:)</P>

"event","<P>Well Saturday night I got ready for nothing...I did jack shit&gt;:o People are gay and like to ruin my plans. So I sat on the computer and talked to Amber about some stuff then listened to 4 drunken boys talk about how they were drunk...fun night, I must say. Yesterday I woke up around 1...did nothing productive of course. I went down to Kristin's and hung out with her for a bit. Danny called me and told me about his party...I'm glad he enjoyed himself for once. Then I went to Bob's Subs with Kristin. We saw some sweet ass cars and lots of hott college boys...this semester shall be fun:) Then I came home and did nothing...again...then I went down to Kristin's for a few to hang out with her, Shooter, and Craiger. They decided to go to Nana's so I came home. Dinner was ready so I ate with my mom and my sister and got online. Watched some of the VMAs...Bruce Willis was dancing to ""Lean Back"" with P. Diddy...it was the BEST thing I have ever seen, I was like...wow, I could die tonight and not care because my life is complete, ahahaha. Meanwhile I talked online...Danny flipped out on me, what fun that was...but oh well its all over, we don't have to worry about shit now. I complained to Gabany and he told me what to do, ha. Then Eric told me that he would help me out;-) if ya wanna know what that means...ask me. So yeah I was just pissed off so I went to bed. I couldn't sleep for shit...finally around 1:30 I fell asleep. Got up this morning and got ready for school...I was running late so I had to put my contacts in at school, haha. My day was uneventful...its school, there's nothing great about it. Came home, changed my clothes cause I was hot...got online...read some shit that fucking pissed me off, so now I'm just in a bitchy mood:) But I'm out for now...peace.</P>

"event","Last night Oagr picked me and Kristin up and we went to Eric Roger's. Danny came with Oagr so I sat in the back with him. He told me that Dave totalled his car and Aaron was with him. Naturally I started freaking out, but he said they were both fine...thank God. I would have killed Dave if he hurt my baby:( Then Ben texts me and asks me to hang out...ahh I was highly pissed with him. In the mean time, I thought I broke my toe while showing Kristin the text message and I was like crying, haha. Oagr called me a toe hoe...don't ask why, he's just weird. Finally we got there and went in Eric's room. It was Eric, Corey White, some Mike kid I don't know, RD, Rod, Gabany, Tony Zigo, and my babyyy Aaron. I walked in and it was like a cloud of smoke, haha. I went and gave Aaron a hug and Gabany came and sat by me. He yelled at me for not talking to him online anymore, haha. Then we started talking about Josh Thompson's house and I told him about the night he wasn't there...how I cried on the floor for an hour and a half, haha...and he was like...have sex with anyone?! And I was like, uhh no...I slept in Josh's bed though, but no sex. And he was like, If you were in a bed with me, there is no way I would be able to just sleep, hahaha. So then they all got the munchies and orginally Gabany was supposed to go and he asked me if I would go with him but go in, and I said yes. THEN he gave the job to B-Rhodes, so I went with him and we got majorly rained on...I was highly pissed. So we went to Country Fair and I had to buy $5 worth of quarter snacks. I looked like a fucking fat ass...I had my arms full of cosmic brownies, star crunches, and fudge rounds, hahaha. And if that wasn't good enough...I had $5 in quarters. hahaha. Then we went back to Eric's house and they were in all their glory, I think I got thanked like a million times. Kristin and Shooter wanted to leave but I didn't because sitting in Shooter's living room alone is not my definition of fun. So Gabany said he'd take me there later. I went in the living room and watched Aaron and Corey play video games, haha...then Tony turned off the tv and told Corey that if he didn't eat his brownie in one bite he wasn't turning on the tv. And he kept calling Corey a fat ass. I felt bad:( haha...but it was funny. Danny was leaving and he said that Gabany would probably spend the night so he said he'd take me to Shooter's instead...so I went in Eric's room and said good-byes. Gabany was laying on the floor so I bent down and hugged him and Eric was like...I WANT A HUG LIKE THAT!!!! So he layed on his bed and I had to hug him, hahaha. He wouldn't let go of me, haha. Then Gabany gave me another hug and told me that I better talk to him online sometime. I got out to Danny's car and realized that I left my phone in Eric's house so I had to walk my ass back up his God damn stairs and get my phone...gave Aaron a hug and left. Got to Shooter's and Danny stayed with me til like 5 then I went to sleep. Got up and Shooter brought us home. I went back to sleep, woke up, went back to sleep...got up, ate, showered, got pretty(for no reason), and watched tv. Now I'm talking to Aaron and he told me that Danny's Grad. party got busted...which blows, bad. But anyways...I'm out...peace.

"event","Monday-I talked to Ben Watson and he asked me if I wanted to come party...so I got ready and we picked up Jamo and went to Ben's house. There were a whole bunch of people there and I met some people I didn't know. I knew Ba-dunk-a-dunk aka Ashley, Mora, Grenci, and I think that was it, haha. I met...Joe Davis(he lives in the house), Corey Vankuso(lives in the house), Dan(Freshman), Matt(transfer freshman), Dominic(freshman), Adam Collins, Nicole, Candice, 4 unknown boys from Butler, Mel(she was awesome), Katie, and Mike Loft. At one point in the night we were all dancing in the living room, haha...it was so much fun:) Then it got too hot, so Adam went outside with me and we had a talk about his cousin...Benny Collins:) haha. Then I went inside, I was forced to drink...ok so maybe I was a LITTLE bit willing:) Then Ben made me play flip cup. Finally I got to quit and then I had to play for the other team cause they were short one person! So I played again and got drunk, haha. Then we all danced some more:) Nicole, Ben, and I were dancing on the table, hahaha. But then people starting leaving and going to bed. Grenci and I were the last ones to go to sleep...we went in one of the rooms and got blankets and pillows and I slept on the living room floor. Woke up at like 9 and went on the love seat cause Grenci left. Then around 12 me, Ben, Dominic, Corey, Matt, Dan, and Joe all woke up at like the same time. We all watched Any Given Sunday...just me and the boys:) Then Ben brought me home and I got showered and stuff then went out to eat with my family. Then I came home, got my shit ready for school and went to bed. 
Wednesday-First day of school. Woo freakin' hoo! I got there and went to my report card homeroom and sat there and listened to the new rules and shit then our day started. It was OK I guess, AP US History...not my thing. Then I had rock'n-ette practice after school. It was alright I guess, it rained a little though and the band sucks. I came home, changed and stuff then went to bed. 
Thursday-Went to school, of course. I had to sit in the Guidance Office forever to see if I could drop AP History for Accelerated Civics...found out I needed a paper signed by my mom so that was a waste of time. Yesterday was just a bad day for me, I was so angry and people are already being ignorant, it just sucks. I'm ready for college already. Last night was light up night. We had to perform. I thought I did pretty well...the flag routine just sucks in general. Afterwards my mom and Glenn took me to Sheetz to get a mto. There were a million people in there! I had to wait a half hour...I had my tights pulled up to my knees(dance tights) and my boots unzippered...it was nice:) haha. There were college football boys staring at me...they probably thought I was retarded, hahaha. Then Shawna<3 and Kyle came in. So I stood with them for a bit and talked to her about our performance, I just love her! haha. Finally got my food and went home. Ate, got changed, washed my face, did homework, and went to bed.
Today-Yet another day of school...TGIF:) I got my History classes switched, thank God. Took notes in Psychology, notes in Pre-calc. and got homework, Did some essay thing in Civics, study guide thing on our book in English, made my bowl in ceramics, and in Physics we got to fly paper airplanes and time how long they stayed in the air. I live like 3 minutes away from the school, it took 15 to 20 minutes to get home today  because traffic is so bad in town because college kids are moving in. Came home, ate, talked online, and took a nap. Got woken up at 7 and I came downstairs and got online. Now I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing tonight...hopefully something. But I'm out for now...peace:)"

"event","Friday after Tom and Mike left I didn't do anything, so I just went to bed. Saturday I went to Kristi's graduation party. Only family was there so it was kind of boring. But my brother came and brought one of his brothers so I got to meet him. He was really quiet and he was tall and skinny...total opposite of Craig. So we ate good food and chatted. Kristi told me some stories, haha...she cracks me up:) Nikki wanted to leave so we left around 7:30 or something. Me and Justin talked about going to Dave's but he had no money, soo that didn't happen. Then Ben Watson texted me and asked me what I was doing...I said nothing, so he was like...I'm at my boy's house but I'll come get you! So around 10:30 him and Molly picked me up. We went to some Jason kid's house. I met...Tim, Nick, Zach, Molly, Wendy, Brittney, and J.R. They kept asking me if I wanted a drink and I said no. Then they asked again and I was like...damn ok! So Wendy made me a mixed drink...orange pop and vanilla vodka. It was soo good, it tasted like a creme cicle. Well I finished that and J.R. was like...take shots with me, you know you want to! So I was like...mannn, okkk:) haha...so I did just that. Then Zach and Molly left because Zach left for basics yesterday and they needed ""alone time"" hahaha. So we all started dancing with eachother...best thing ever. I got Ben to dance, he's real good for ""never dancing"". We had a train goin' on...Ben, me, J.R., Brittney, Wendy, and Leah. Then Offer came...he didn't dance with us, hahaha:( Then Jason got his second wind and danced to ""Jump on it"" with all of us. Oh man, it was the best time ever. Then we all started getting tired and Ben was too drunk to drive so I drove us to his house. He slept on the love seat and I slept on the big couch, haha...he could have slept in his bed, but he's retarded. Woke up at like 10 and he brought me home. I got showered and all that then went to Butler to get Kristin's baby shower present then went to her dad's for her baby shower. It was fun...I got to paint a onesy, it says ""Someone who loves me very much made me this SHIRT!"" Its so cute:) Then Doug and Keri stayed til like 12 and me and Kristin were so tired, haha. But it was fun to talk to Doug, Kristin, Paul, and Jenn about our old trailor park days when I was like 4. I was surprised that I remembered all the people we talked about. So finally around 1ish they left and we went to bed. Woke up this morning, ate food, and took a shower. Then Jenn, Kristin, and I went to Wal Mart to buy Kristin more stuff. The money she got was just burning a hole in her pocket, hahaha. She got so much stuff it was crazy. Then we ate at Wendy's and went back to her house. My momma picked me up at like 7:15 and I drove home:) Now I'm just waiting for Ben to call me and tell me when he's picking me up:) My last night of summer...sad, but its going to be spent well! Benjamin's house with all my favorite college boys and hopefully Jamo if she loves me:) haha. But I'm out, peace.

"event","Thursday...what do you know...I went to band camp, it was the worst day of my life. People were bitchy and I was just in a bad mood. We had to do parade in the rain...not cool. So I came home...layed around, Kristin and Trav came over for a little bit. I took a 2 hour nap, ha. Got up, ate food, and watched the Olympics. Carly Patterson is my hero and I love her, ha. I fell asleep on the couch cause my sister and Jesse talk too loud and I can hear them through my wall. Woke up at 2:30 and went in my bed. Got up at 8 and took a shower. Linds<33 came and picked me up for band camp. HALF A DAY TODAY, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!! At the end Maxwell goes...thats Band camp 2004, it was the best feeling ever, hahaha. Then Christina, Maxwell, and Jenn got all of us together and Maxwell made his 10 hour speech before he told us that OUR NAME CAN BE ROCK'N-ETTES!!!!!!!!! We were all so excited. I'm so in love with Mr. Maxwell, hahaha. Afterwards some of us went to lunch at Luigi's. It was a good time. Then Ninner brought me and Jamo home. Me and Jamo sat around and watched tv then her daddy came and got her. I took a nap:) Got up and ate dinner with my mom and sister. Then Thomas came to play with me...the best day ever!!!!!!!! We watched tv and talked. Then Micheal came to play with us too:) I love those boys...I must say. Then they left...we sang happy birthday to Jesse, and then I took a shower. Now I'm waiting for Justin to call me so I know what I'm doing tonight. But I'm out...peace."

"event","Yesterday I had to get up earlier then usual because I had to shower and actually get pretty for our band pictures. Jamo came and picked me up and we went to the high school...we had to be there at 8:30.  So we waited 'til the seniors were all done, got our individuals and our buttons/keychains if we had them. Then we had to go to the stands and get the whole band picture then we got our Dance 'n Drill picture. We were the first ones done so we had to sit around and wait. We all went and changed because we had to practice after. Got changed and then talked to the football boys because they had to go to a meeting in the LGI. I miss some of them alot...haven't seen anyone this summer. Then we had to wait forever for the bus to take us to the Elementary and when we got there we had to stretch and do kicks the whole half hour we had left before lunch. Then we learned our 3rd song routine...well some of it and put it on the field. Came home, showered and all that then went to my mom's hair appt. with her. I drove til we got to McDonalds then she drove so I could eat. Her hair lady took my outside and showed me that the parts of my hair where there was blonde...is now green because of the dye. Needless to say...I was pissed. So I played with Sue's daughters while my mom got her hair done. Then Sue offered my mom a glass of wine, haha...so we went in the house and picked it out. We talked to her husband and brother for a while...they are hilarious men. Finally my momma was done and we left...I drove of course:) Came home, got online, and I had every intentions of going to bed at like 10...turned on the tv and gymnastics finals were on the tv damnit, haha. So I layed on the couch and watched them...USA got a silver:( The judges hate them for some reason and gives them shitty scores. Anyways I fell asleep on the couch, woke up at like 12:45 and went in my bed. I woke up at 8...got ready and went to band camp. Today fucking sucked...everyone is starting to get bitchy and some people think they have the right to be cunts to people just because they're older. There is no need to be mean and its just plain unnecessary. Oh well, 2 more days...thank God. We're done with all 3 performances so thats cool. Now its just perfecting them. I had to go back to the Hair Studio today and get my hair fixed...it better fucking work this time or I will be so mad. Jamo came with me though:) And this kid that I met at Danny's show, Pat, came in and he was like...do I know you from somewhere, and I was like yeah...so I had to explain to him how, haha. Came home, got online, Jamo left...and now I'm here. I'm gonna eat then shower and hopefully go to sleep early tonight. But I'm out...peace."

"event","So last night I couldn't fall asleep because Nikki and Jesse were fighting and they were really loud, I didn't fall asleep til after 1...I was pissed. So I got up this morning and got ready for band camp then Jamo picked me up. Today was kind of an uneventful day for us...but I wasn't complaining. I got darker of course, because we were in the sun ALL day. After camp I came home, showered real quick and went to the Hair Studio to get my hair done. I got it dyed back to my natural color and cut. Casey, Andie, and Kailee walked in as I was getting it blow dryed...perfect timing:) So I went with them and we went to my house real quick so I could get money and my eyeliner and eye shadow. Then we all went to Casey's and Jamo and Em were there. Cori gave me a hug because we haven't seen eachother forever, I love her! We all sat in Casey's room for a bit and talked then we left. Andie had to go home to change so Jamo and Em went with her and Kailee and I went with Casey. Casey wanted to look at earings for her ear so we went to Claire's and the Piercing Pagoda in the mall, she didn't find what she wanted though. So we made reservations at the Texas Roadhouse then walked around. We found Markie then we saw Donkey and talked to him for a little bit then Jamo, Em, and Andie came. We all walked to the Roadhouse and met Angela there, got seated, then Jess came. We had them sing Happy Birthday to Jess even though her birthday was a month ago, hahaha. We all ate and had some fun talks, haha...I love those girls so much. Then when I ran to Casey's car to get shot gun, I'm standing at the door and the truck beside me rolls down their window and I hear ""crackhead"" and I was like...wtf?!?! And I turn around and it was Benny Campbell and AJ Durso!!! So I talked to them for a few minutes then we left. Jamo, Casey, Kailee, and I had more interesting and fun talks on the way home. We dropped Kailee off then Casey dropped me and Jamo off at my house. I had alot of fun, I definitely love all those girls. Tomorrow we have pictures at 8:30 therefore I must rise at 7...not cool. So I'm gonna go to sleep soon:) I'm out for now...peace.

"event","Friday I, of course, went to band camp...we got our uniforms!!!!!! Ahh it was a beautiful thing. Then I came home, got a shower, and went to Ross Park with my mom and her friend Sherri to finish school shopping. I honestly did not like much, which is sad for me, so after like an hour and a half...I was like, mom can we be done because I'm sick of shopping. Needless to say, she wasn't complaining. So we went out to eat at TGI Fridays...I had shrimp alfredo, it was pretty good. Then we came home and I sat around then I talked to Danny and made him come over:) haha...so he came over around 12:30 and I was sooo tired so he left at like 2:30..I felt bad though:( Saturday I woke up at 12, I was really proud of myself. Finally got ahold of Kristin around 1 something and I decided that I would go camping with her, Shooter, and Craiger. So I got ready and all that then went down to her house. Shooter came and we left for Tionesta. We had to make a pitstop in Franklin cause I had to pee BAD. So we stopped at Wendy's and everyone got food and I peed. Finally we got there around 4ish and pretty much just sat around. We went to the building and ate and sang happy birthday to some guy, haha. Then we decided we were bored so we didn't even stay to camp, haha. We left at like 8:30 and called Dave to find a party. He said people were at his house so we headed there. I had to pee again, of course, so we stopped at Giant Eagle in Oil City and they didn't have a bathroom!!!!! So I peed in between Giant Eagle and some trailor thing...where no matter where anyone was driving they could see me pee, hahhaa...but I didn't care, I had to go! After we got past Franklin Shooter let me drive:) Then he needed gas so we stopped at a gas station and I went pee AGAIN!!! Then we switched back drivers. Finally we got to Dave's and only Rod and Corey were there cause everyone else went to Burger King. So we waited for them to get back and they did like 15 minutes later. It was Dave, Kindra, Aaron, Eric, and Kyle. Kyle runs in and shows me the pipe him and Dave made...ya know those finding nemo toys ya got in the happy meals, well they made a bowl out of nemo!!!! It was sad:( So I talked to Kindra...Aaron and Eric gave me hugs:) I miss those boys terribly! Eric got a perm, hahaha...its cute I guess? Then we decided to leave and go to Kate Chapman's party. We got there and pretty much no one was there...it was Kate, Andrea(don't know her last name), Jenn Osbourne, and Erica(don't know how to spell her last name), and Alex Jack. So we stood around for a while, some other people that I don't know came and Tony Zigo. But we left and went back to Dave's...everyone (but me) got high and Shooter, Kristin, and Amanda(Shooter's cousin) all got drunk. Therefore when we left...I got to drive again!!!:) So they told me to turn too late in Shooter's driveway, so they were like...oh just go through the yard! I was freaking out but I did it. Then I had to take Amanda to her house and when I was pulling out I had no idea where I was going to I possibly scrapped his car off of rocks? hahahaha...omg I was flipping out. So then Shooter decides that he's driving and drove through the field to his house and did donuts in his yard, I was screaming. Then we went inside...did nothing, Kristin and Shooter went into his room so that left me alone in the living room. I called Kindra and told her that if Danny came out to Dave's to have him call me. So around 2 Danny called me and he said he'd come over and stay with me. He got there around 2:30 and we watched tv and went to sleep. Got up this morning in a BAD MOOD. So I was like, I WANT TO GO HOME!!!!! Shooter gave Danny 10 dollars to take me home, haha cause he didn't want to drive and Kristin didn't want to leave yet. So Danny brought me home and I fell asleep on the couch while we were watching tv so he left and I took a nap on my mom's bed. I didn't wake up til 4 and no one was home so I ate and did nothing. Tomorrow I have band camp and after that I'm getting my hair dyed...I'm taking out the blonde and red and just keeping my natural color. Then possibly hanging out with all the dance 'n drill girls at Casey B's:) But I'm out...peace."

"event","Lets see...Sunday I did absolutely nothing. Monday I had band camp so I got up at 7:45 and took a shower, got ready, then went to band camp. We learned more of our dance and thats about it. Monday after band camp I did nothing again until Kristin came over at like 6 or something and we hung out for a little bit. Then I went to bed to repeat the same God forsaken thing...got up at 8 on Tuesday, got ready and went to band camp. Tuesday we started our flag dance, I hate the flag...plain and simple. We did drill downs for the first time. I suck at them since I've never marched but oh well, you'll have that. So Tuesday night...what do you know, I did NOTHING. Took a shower, went to sleep, and got up at 8 of course on Wednesday and went to band camp! We did more of our dance and we were on the field most of the day yesterday...but it was breezy so it was the best day so far. Then I came home, got ready and went school shopping with my dad...lets just say that Walter Elroy Shumaker Jr. is the cutest man ever when it comes to shopping. So I knew exactly what I wanted so I was done shopping in like an hour and a half. We went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner:) Of course I talked alot...because well, I'm good at that. Then he brought me home and I sat on the computer for the rest of the night. I finally talked to Danny last night. It was a good phone call, so that was cool. Then I went to sleep...got up this morning at 8...AGAIN, got ready and went to band camp. It was raining so we were in the school the whole day. We did our dance, learned the rest of it, then went to lunch. After lunch we did flags then went on the field again for our flag song and we had to do it a million times...I definitely got VERY bitchy. Then we talked about getting jackets and some of the seniors said they wanted Fleece instead, well I vote hell no on the fleece because they are the ugliest things ever...Jamo and Markie agree:) haha, I love you girls!!!! So I came home and I went to sleep because I was so tired and bitchy, I slept til 8 something and it has brought me to here...I am still as bitchy and tired as I was so I'm going to bed at 10. I need to get sleep for real, I can't take going to bed at like 12:30 and getting up at 8 everyday and going to band camp til 3:30, its kicking my ass. Well anyways, I'm out...peace.

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Thursday night Danny got here at like 11 or something and we sat around waiting for Kristin and Shooter. I think at like 12 Shooter got there and we all went to Eat 'n Park for something to do. I got a salad and cheese sticks:) Shooter kept threatening to throw cheese sticks at me because he said I was being mean. We had to wait forever to get our check. So when Danny was paying me and Kristin were acting like lesbians...like hugging and shit, hahaha. Some girls walked by and they looked disgusted and we just laughed our asses off. Then we went home and Kristin and Shooter went to Kristin's house and Danny and I came to my house. We watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was pretty scary...it was more freaky I guess. When it was over he left and I went to bed. Yesterday I didn't wake up til really late. I called Kristin and we went and ate then I came home and got ready cause Josh was coming to get me. So Josh and Derrick picked me up and we went to Josh's and watched Super Troopers and Starsky and Hutch and ordered pizza. Then Derek Dickey came and we all went to Steph Burgard's. I played beer pong...I was on Josh's team and we played against Derek and Freya. Josh and I won of course:) They didn't even get one in, hahaha. But then the rest of the night I was reallyyyyy bored so FINALLY we left. Derrick and Derek came back to Josh's with us. They all drank more when we got there and Josh's sister Tammy was there but she didn't stay up long. Well I pissed Josh off so he went in the bedroom and passed out, hahaha. So me, Derrick, and Derek all sat at the table and talked about a whole bunch of stuff...it was fun. But then I went to sleep...well tried...Josh was going crazy at one point and I was afraid to fall asleep, haha. Finally I fell asleep and I believe I was woken up at 9:30. We all sat around for a while then Josh and Derrick brought me home. I got ready and stuff then Cody picked me up and we went to Boyer's Fest. It sucked my ass, its not even worth talking about...it was so freaking boring. Tami brought me home at&nbsp;like 11:30. Josh goes back to Washington tomorrow...but its ok cause I'm going to see him Sept. 4-8. It'll be my 2nd plane ride ever and its all within 3 months, haha. But I'm going to go...peace:)</FONT></P>

"event","Well lets see...yesterday I had band camp so I had to wake up at 8 again. Not fun at all. I took a shower and got ready then my sister brought me to the school. It wasn't very sunny outside, actually it was pretty shitty but it was sooooo humid. We learned parade and practiced that til perfection...it gets so old after a while. Then we practiced cheer cheer and pre-game more. It started raining so we had to go in the school. We got to listen to the music that we will be dancing to, its awesome. THEN we got to try on our new uniforms!!!! They're awesome, I love them...and they fit perfectly because they measured us and made them to our measurements. They're black this year with silver and red sequence, ahhhh I love them! But then we practiced more and then it was time to leave:) I called Kristin and woke her up and we went to eat...I got a steak mto and she got Bob's subs. We also stopped into Images Unlimited to see Shooter's senior pictures and to talk to Mr. Leary. Then we came home and I got online. I talked to B-Rhodes for a few minutes then I talked to Danny. Glenn came over for dinner so I called Kristin and asked her if she wanted to come too, so she did. We all had some crazy talks, haha...I love my family. Then we were sitting at the table and I heard bass and I was like...that's someone we know and it was Cody and Culp!!! So we ran down to Kristin's and we jumped on Culp, ahhh how we have missed him!!! It was like the good ol' days. So we talked to them for awhile and they were supposed to go hang out with Kelly Hogue and Krystal but Cody told them he made different plans, haha. Well then me and Kristin came back to my house and we were just sitting there and Cody opens the door and asks us if we want to go do something...so I put pants on since I was still in shorts from band camp and got a sweatshirt and we left with them. We went to Cody's and decided we wanted to go to the street fair and Bill Lyons called so Cody went to pick him up. We were going through Harrisville and someone called Bill and said the street fair was dead so we went to Harrisville park to turn around and we ran into Brandon Mokel, Tara Grossman, Stew, and Steve Kay. So we all got out and hung out there for a while...the boys played b-ball and I caught up on Tara's life, haha. Then we left and we all came to my house and Jared Knight and Brandon Christophel came over too. They all stayed for about an hour then left. I talked to Danny about some shit for a little bit then went to bed. At 3:30 I wake up to my damn doorbell ringing and I was so scared since I was alone...but it was Cody, Bill, Stew, and Steve. I was like...OMG get out of my house I'm sleeping!!!!! So eventually I got them to leave and went back to sleep. It was hell getting up this morning but I did and got in the shower and got ready then Jamo and Papa J picked me up. It was so cold this morning, I thought I was gonna die. But after we ran I got hot so that was a plus, haha. WE STARTED OUR DANCE TODAY!!!!!!! It's so cute and I'm really excited. So we pretty much practiced that all day. And while Christina was making up parts of the dance with the seniors, the rest of us practiced everything else. After lunch it seemed like practice would never end but finally it did and Jamo and I had to wait for Papa J to pick us up. When I got home I walked to the Hair Studio to see Kristin cause she was still getting her hair done. I stayed there for an hour then came home. I layed out for an hour...I pretty much fell asleep, haha...so I came inside and I had a message from my mom saying we were having chinese for dinner!!!!! WOOO HOOOO!!!!! I think Kristin, Shooter, Danny, and I are hanging out tonight so that'll be cool. But I'm out for now:) Peace.

Anyways, so I went to bed as early as I could since I had band camp Monday. I got up at 8 and got in the shower and all that. I got ready and my sister brought me to the school. I talked to Jamo and Lindsay...my long lost lover, oh how I've missed her!!!! So we had to walk to the MS teacher's parking lot b/c thats where Christina was. Then we had to run 3 laps around the parking lot...me and Linds ran with eachother<33 After that we had to stretch and then we learned the pre-game lines and routine. It wasn't too bad. We got a few water breaks and then we did kicks and leaps...woo hoo!!!! Then we practiced pre-game a bit then we ate lunch. Andie found a froggy when we went to the bathroom and she made Mego pick it up, haha. So we put it in my carrot container and made him our mascot. But he jumped out while we were practicing:( So then we learned ""Cheer Cheer"" and she broke us up into smaller groups and made us show her everything we learned. Then we got to leave at 2:30 and Jamo and Aunt Pam brought me home. I layed out for a little bit and Kristin came out to talk to me. Then I came inside at like 4:30 and I went and took a nap. I told my mom to wake me up at 7 if I wasn't up so 7 rolled around and she tried to wake me up and I wouldn't get up. I told Danny to come over at 7:30 and I woke up at 8 so good thing he was late, haha. I got up and took a shower and got dressed and stuff. Then I came downstairs and my mom made me food. Danny sat at the table and talked to me. I made him look at pictures with me, haha. After that we sat at the computer and listened to music while we waited for Kristin and Shooter. Well my sister's friend Joanna was here and I looked over at her and she was on the phone and I heard her say ""How did he die?"" My heart automatically sank and I couldn't breathe. When she got off the phone she told me that Matt Barr had gotten in an accident on his way to work and he got killed. It just feels like it will never end, honestly. But then Danny and I just sat at the computer talking and he told me that Tabbi made a comment about me being black...its just so funny how immature some people can be. Yeah I'm black cause being NATIVE American and African American are ALMOST the same thing, right?! hahaha...yeah, grow up. Anyways, so Kristin came over and told me that we had to go down to Dominos in a half hour to meet Shooter...well she went alone anyways, so I just stayed here with Danny. Then her and Shooter came in. We all hung out and talked for a while then Kristin and Shooter ""went to Nana's"". That was at like 2 and they came back in at like 4 then they both went home and Danny went home at 5 and I went to sleep. I got up late today because I was so tired, when I do physical activity in the sun it makes me sick and I get really tired. But anyways, I did nothing today and I'm sure I will be nothing tonight because I have band camp again tomorrow...9:30-2:30 so I'm just gonna stay home I think. But I'm out for now.

and if we all believe in Heaven
maybe we'll make it through one more year, down here.

"event","Well Friday night Kristin and I went to David James' house with Justin. When we got there Matt Wilson, Chris Dinofrio, Craaazyyy Gary, Chris's sister, Dave, Kendra, and Aaron were all in the garage. They were all....high? hahahaha. So Kristin and I walked to Chris's car with him to get ""something"". Then we went back in the garage and everyone smoked...ALOT!!! They smoked for like 2 hours straight...hittin' the gravity bong and all that jazz, haha. Then we all decided we were hungry soooo Kristin and I went with Justin and Crazy Gary, Jessi, and Matt all went with Chris and we went to Burger King. The drive there was uhh...interesting? haha. We were in front of the courthouse and Justin goes...wow thats a big building, hahahahaha. Oh man, high people crack my shit up. So we ate at Burger King...Kristin and I kept throwing french fries into Chris's car through the window, haha. We finished our food and went back to Dave's. When we got there Kyle Nungent was there. He was like...whoaaa its Kristin's party all over again...minus a few people, haha.&nbsp;So of course...everyone smoked MORE like it was necessary. It was fun watching people do the gravity bong though...coughin' and shit, haha. Then Shooter&lt;33, Josh Davis, and Craiger all came. This time I didn't scream SHOOTERRRRR and he was disappointed:( haha. But I gave him a hug and we talked about his pink and black fox racing sweatshirt he had on, hahaha. Then Danny came at like 1-1:30 and I was like...whoa, hey thats Danny! haha. We didn't talk at first...not sure why, but we didn't. Aaron...the little shit that he is, took Danny outside and ""talked to him about something"". Then Mikey and the kid thats always with him(don't know his name) came. Everyone smoked more...again, like it was necessary. Someone made me VERY angry so I went and sat with Justin in his car...he was all passed out and shit and I was bitching up a storm, haha. He probably didn't even here a word I said, oh well. But then I made him get out so I could be alone and I listened to music. Then Aaron came to talk to me. Justin came back in the car then Danny came out to see what was wrong. I got out and talked to him for a while...then Shooter left so we had to relocate so we went and stood by Danny's car. Everyone went to sleep and we were still standing outside by his car, haha. Well my knees started hurting so we went in the garage and sat on the comfy chairs...good timing cause it started pouring outside. We started getting wet in the garage so we went in Dave's car. I made hand prints on his back window so it looked like people were having sex in the back seat of his car, hahaha!!! Well we fell asleep for like 2 hours then Kristin called my phone cause she didn't know where I was. Her and Justin went and got drinks and she brought me back juice and a symphony bar&lt;33...then we left cause we wanted to go to sleep in a BED. We got to my house at like 9:30 and I went in my mom's bed...I didn't wake up til 4:50 hahaha...I was BEAT. So I got up and came downstairs and Kristin was awake talking to my sister, haha. We tried to find something to do like all day and then finally Justin called Danny and asked him if he knew of any parties and he said there was one right down the road from him. So Kristin and I got ready and then we called Jamie cause we wanted her to come with us. So she came over then Justin came and picked us up. We had to stop at Josh Thompson's so I could get my phone charger finally, haha. Then we headed off to Mercer. No one would believe me that I knew where Danny's road was...but what do you know...I DID! So I told Justin where to turn and we went down the road and we couldn't find the party and when Justin called Danny his signal faded. So I told him just to go to Danny's house and ask him. Well no one would get out of the freaking car to go up to the damn door...so I was like...holy shit, lets all go then!!!!! I knew that it would be worthless to knock on the front door so we just went to the basement door and went in. Danny was in his room with Tabbi, Jim, Aimee, and Mike. I told Danny that Justin needed to know where he was going so he said he would just take his pitbike there and we could follow him. Well when we were in there...I don't know which girl it was but they said ""Speak of the devil"" and Tabbi was like...""why are you here?"" So I got fucking pissed and just left everyone in there and slammed the door. I fucking HATE girls...they are so fucking dumb. ANYWAYS...so we followed Danny there. When we got there I knew NO ONE. But Danny introduced me to some of them. I met Kinger, Donnie Seidle, Pez, Jordan, Clay(douche bag), Brandon Ridgeway, and later Kayla(Donnie's sister) introduced herself since Danny didn't introduce us, haha. Well Kristin, Jamie, Donnie, and Pez were all down by Justin's car so we went down there with them. Then Dave and Kendra came and we talked to Kendra, she's so cute, I love her, haha. Then none other then the infamous Eric Gabany showed up...my long lost friend, I haven't seen him in a while. Well Danny wanted cigarettes so Gabany and Donnie left. They didn't come back forever because they stopped at Jenn Osbourne's party. When they got back Donnie was like...Erica was there and I just walked by and didn't even say hi, haha. He cracks me up. Some crazy shit started happening though, haha...people were beating eachother up, haha. Some kid punched Ridgeway in the back of the head...it didn't even phase him but the kid was still flipping out and A GIRL was holding him back, haha. But Danny, Donnie, Jamie, Kristin, Justin, Pez, Craiger, Josh Davis, and I all went and sat by the fire. Well then Kristin, Jamie, and I all went in the garage to talk to Shooter and Jordan and fucking Peters threw beer in Ridgeway's face so Ridgeway threw it back at him and it got all over Jamie, Kristin, and I...oh God I was FLIPPING out, I went back to the fire and I was like, I want to fucking go home!!!!!!!! But we didn't leave, haha. So Danny, Donnie, Pez and I all went in the garage to play on the foosball table. Me and Danny kicked their ass!!!!! WOO HOO, hahahaha!!!! Well then Clay decided to come over and be fucking gay and start touching Jamie and I was flipping out on him...I was like, get the fuck away from my friend...she's 15 and she does not like you! Well some bitches were like...he's not even doing anything leave him alone. The one girl has a fucking kid and I wanted to be like...bitch shut up and go home and take care of your God damn child. Ugh I was pissed. Anyways...some more shit happened but its not worth telling, haha. So we decided to go home cause we were all hungry as shit. I said bye to Donnie, Kayla, Gabany, and Jordan. Then we left. We came to my house and I made shrimp, haha. Jamie and Kristin made cheese sticks. We talked for awhile then I was like...shit I'm tired, I'm going to bed! So I went to sleep and I have no clue what they all did, haha. Then I woke up at 11 so I could wake Danny up for work. So I called him and his dad answered and he was like...he's sleeping, and I was like, he told me to wake him up for work, haha...so his daddy went and woke him up and I talked to him for a little bit. I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn't so I just got up and got online. Josh Shields called me so I talked to him for a little bit. Kristin is still here, but she's sleeping, haha. Anyways...I'm out, peace."

"event","<P>Today I actually got up early for me...well being sick and all. I got in the shower and got all ready and stuff. Got online and saw that Amber was on...talked to her then she came and picked me up so I could dye her hair. We went to Giant Eagle so grandpa could pick up gram's medicine then we went to Rite Aid so Amber could get hair dye. Went to her house and started dyeing her hair. We used Grade-A tin foil beatch. Woo we are awesome! Anyways...so we sat online while we waited for the dye to set in. Washed it out...the top was orange, so we put brown in it...washed it out...its darker orange. So we gave up and decided we will just buy better shit whenever she gets more money and redo it. So she ate dinner and all that then she tried to get gram to let her out of the house...no luck:( So they brought me home. I came home and ate dinner with Nikki and my mom. After dinner Nikki and I talked for a little bit about some stuff...had a few laughs, cause she needs it right now! I feel so bad for her...Jesse's in jail and she's suffering too. Anywho...I called Kristin cause my mom told me she called. She came up to hang out with me. I decided that I wanted Dairy Queen so my madge gave me money and Nikki took me and Kristin there. I got a French Vanilla Moolatte...it made me sick! Then when we got home Kristin and I went for a walk on the good ol' town of SR. We stopped at Subway to see if Flea was working...and he was. So we told him stories about her party and stuff since he didn't come. Then they went outside and smoked and I went out to talk to them. But he had to go back inside and clean and all that so we hugged him and went walking through campus. There were a bunch of people walking so we went to investigate...nothing interestin...they were just walking to Luigi's. So we walked home and she went home and I came home. I got online and talked to Amber...we played our ""song game"" but we did it differently...i liked it, haha. We're nerds, but I love it. I also talked to Tom...we decided that we miss eachother and still love eachother. Damn Tom...things aren't the same without you:( I was actually sad the 2 weeks we really didn't speak...it sucked and it ate at me:( Anyways...whenever his car is all good and ready to go, we are definitely hanging out! Yeah so I have Tom back in my life...but Brandon Rhodes has slipped away...not cool. I don't know what his problem is but he's being mean to me and saying ignorant stuff...its awesome, let me tell you! ANYWAYS...I talked to Danny about something very important...I still don't know what to believe, but whatever. You can't change who a person is...no matter how much you want to. Then Kristin called me all high and stuff...hahaha:-* she was bored so she came up and ate some food, haha. I love her! So the rest of the night I have been complaining to Aaron about all my problems...poor kid, haha. Oh well, he loves me, hahaha. Aaron Michael Alexia...what would I do without you?! So yeah...tomorrow Kristin and I are going to Dave's with Justin. Hopefully we have a good time, I could use it. But I'm going for now. Peace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm so in <EM><U><FONT color=#ff0000>love</FONT></U></EM> with you boy...I can't deny it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><U>Sarah</U>, I'm sure you'll see this sooo I figured I'd just say this to you in here...I'm sorry I called you a bitch, I was judging you. But if you actually said you didn't like me because I'm a cheerleader then I guess we were just doing the same thing. I don't really know you, so I shouldn't have said that...and I truly am sorry. Thats not the kind of person I am, believe it or not. But anyways...I figured I'd get that out of the way. </P>"

"event","<P>Yesterday I woke up at 2:30 cause of course I'm sick as hell. Fun stuff I must say. Around 4:30 I got in the shower cause Amber wanted me to go with her to get her hair cut so I had to shower. Then my mom came home...Glenn and Chelsea came with her. We had chinese&lt;33 I had shrimp fried rice...good shit right there. Then we watch Bill Clinton&lt;3 speak on tv...too bad he can't run for president ever again:( Then around 7 Amber got here and we went to the mall. First we looked in Pac Sun for my shoessss and belt buckles then we looked in AE. Then we went to Regis and looked through the books for hair cuts...only found one decent one. Then the lady cut Amber's hair...not much change though, she was pretty pissed cause she payed $25 for nothing really. So we went back to AE and looked around some more and Amber bought a shirt. Then we found grandpa and we went to Wendy's cause we were both hungry. We ate in there since she couldn't drive and eat at the same time...had some interesting talks, haha. ""You're screwing"" oh boyeee hahahaha! Then she brought me home and I tried to get online but AOL was being very gay. So I watched tv...then Amber called me and told me that she didn't think she would be online cause their car broke down, haha. I talked to Danny on the phone for a little bit. Then finally got online after all this bullshit. Amber called me back and we had to go pick her up cause AAA is dumb. Got back on, talked to people then went to bed. Got up today at 12:30...I was proud of myself, haha! Got online and stuff...talked to Amber. Then Danny got on and we had to figure out what was going on with his show today. Got ahold of Kristin and asked her to come with me. So Danny came and got us. We got lost going to the show like 3 different time...we passed it twice and didn't know it! We finally got there though and no one was there yet so it was ok. So about 7:30 Danny's band started...they were good, it just sucks that you can't hear Danny sing cause the rest of the band is too loud. Then some Arcade band...Indie Rock(hippie chicks) played...they freaked me out. Then Geography played...they were awesome, but again same problem...can't hear the singer! Then some other band played...forget their name, but I liked them alot! But I got kinda pissed off so I wanted to leave real bad...so we did. Lots of shit is going on and I'm just pissed off, and I wish I didn't care!!!!!!!! But I do, and its a big problem. Anyways...tomorrow I think me and Amber are doing something? But I dunno, I'm gonna go. Peace it.</P>

"event","<P>Friday night Justin came over, and we had to sit here for like an hour and a half or so waiting for Jamie to get here. Then she got here and we went to pick up Matt. We had to wait forever in his driveway for him...I was like WTF Matt?!? So then we went to see if Chris was home...his mom said that he went to Dairy Queen, poor woman doesn't know how bad her child is, haha. Justin tried calling him like 80 times and he wouldn't answer and you can't leave a voicemail cause his mailbox is full. So we decided just to go out to David James' house. When we got there it was just Dave, Kendra, Mikey, and some other kid. Then we decided that we were all hungry so Justin, Matt, Jamie and I all went to Burger King and McDonalds...I refused to eat at Burger King so thats why we went both places, haha. Then we went to BP to see some Jeremy kid and Matt wanted to go smoke with him and some other kid, so we left him and went back to Dave's. We sat out in the car forever cause we didn't know people were inside, haha. Then we saw Kendra and Dave's cousin Ashley come and we were like...ok maybe people are here. So we went inside and what do ya know...there was Danny sitting at the computer, haha. He's dumb and didn't hear Dave when he was like...oh yeah and your ex-girlfriend is here with her friend, so he was like...wow I didn't know you were gonna be here. Poor kid, he's a genius, I swear. But anywho...we all went outside and Dave started the fire and Mikey got back with the alcohol so people started drinking. Around 12:30 B Rhodes got there...talked on his phone almost the whole time...little bitch. Justin and Jamie sat in Justin's car and listened to music cause they were bored. Then Chris and crazy Gary<FONT color=#ff0000>&lt;33</FONT> showed up like 2 seconds after we decided we wanted to leave, haha. I talked to Gary for a few minutes, he doesn't speak much...so I always tell him that he's a crazy mother fucker in hiding...and someday someone is going to make him angry and he's gonna bust a cap in their ass...hahaha! But anyways, I rode with Danny and Jamie rode with Justin back to my house. Me and Danny got here like 20 minutes before them...and I was like...oh no, Justin killed my friend! and her seatbelt doesn't work!!!! they're dead! hahaha...so I called Jamie and she was like...well Justin tried to go the same way as Danny and got lost so we're almost there, hahaha. So then got here and we all talked and watched tv and I decided I was tired so I went to bed and so did everyone else. Saturday I woke up at like 11...I was pissed, hahaha. Kristin was here and her, Justin, and Jamie were all up talking. So I came downstairs and talked with them. Then Kristin left and Justin did a little later. I put some clothes on and my mom came and got me and we dropped Jamie off at home. I watched Kyla with my mom til about 5:30 and we picked Jamie back up and I came home and got ready. I came down from my shower and Kristin, Craig, and Trav were here, haha. I finally put on clothes and did my hair. Then Jamie and I went down to Kristin's and we walked with her to meet Lorin, AJ, and Jesse at Sheetz. We had to wait there forever...it sucked. Then some REALLY hott college kid asked us if we needed a ride somewhere....we were like, no thanks...but he was soooo hott. THEN these 2 guys pulled up and the passenger was like...you guys alright? do you need something...a ride, anything? We were like...uhh no, do we look homeless or something??!?! hahahaha. Finally they showed up and Kristin got in the truck with them and me and Jamie walked back. ""Your dog is cute, but you cuter though"" hahahahha....ahh I love Jamie Lee Anderson! We got back to Kristin's and then Justin and Matt got there. Little bit later Mike and Chris showed up and got money off of everyone for beer. $72 worth of beer, haha...we got 4 cases of 24. Shooter, Craiger, Josh Davis, and Jenn stopped over for a bit...I freaking love Shooter to death. They didn't stay long though<FONT color=#33ffff>:-(</FONT> Then Eric MF Rogers, Nate, and Kyle Nungent came. I got trashed...I said I wasn't drinking but Mike made me so he kept handing me beers, I was like...damnnnn, please stop I'm gonna die, haha. Well needless to say...I was wasted and I puked for about 2 hours if not more. I just layed on the couch and put my head in the garbage can. I felt like shit...and still do, haha. I woke up at like 9 and I was like...dude I'm going home to sleep in my mom's bed. So I came home and put on pj's and I didn't wake up til 1:15. Talked online...talked to Josh on the phone...then at like 3:30 I went back in my mom's room and passed out again. I slept on and off til 8. My throat and ears are killing me...I think I screwed up my throat from puking, ha. I got up and got on the computer, talked to Josh again on the phone...made hot tea for my throat and now I'm just sitting here. I'll probably go to sleep early tonight, haha...since I feel like crap and all. But I'm out...<FONT color=#ff0000>&lt;33</FONT>.</P>

"event","<P>Well kids, this one is going to be <FONT color=#cc33cc>LONG</FONT>...I haven't updated in a week:-/ so here it goes...</P>
<P><FONT size=1>Friday 7/16- Me and Kristin sat around most of the day and did nothing. Then we decided to go visit Flea at Subway.Made some plans with him...also saw Shmeigel(WEIRD coincidence I must say) Then we went back to my house and got ready and stuff. Mike came and got us and we went to Joe Sadler's til it was time to meet Flea. So at like 10:45? we went to meet Flea. We couldn't think of anywhere to go drinking so we just went back to Joe's. Flea and Mike got drunk...Kristin and I didn't feel like drinking. Then Josh called me at like 1:15 and I was like...shit son, do you realize its 1 a.m.&nbsp; here?!?! Cause he's in Washington and their time is 3 hours behind our's. Anyways, we talked for a while...more like he bitched at me, then I talked some sense into him! Then we went inside and some Tammy chick came and we wanted to leave cause Mike was being dumb...so she took Kristin, Flea, and I home. We sat around at my table and BSed then finally went to bed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Saturday- Was uneventful for Kristin and I til 5 o' clock which meant...Flea was at work and we could get free subs!!!! hahaha. So we walked to Subway and got some food...talked to Flea for a bit then walked back to my house. Josh Thompson told me that we were all just going to party at his house...so I told Kristin she was coming with me. I left my phone charger in Mike's car so we looked out my window half the day hoping he would show up...then finally he did! And we went down and talked to him and Chris for a little. Then Oagr and Josh came to get us. We all sat around for a little bit...Josh, Tom, Sarah P.(bitch), Oagr, Kristin, and I. Then I called Russell cause he was supposed to come to my house but since plans changed Josh said to invite him to his house...so I did just that. So Tom gave him directions and he came. We all started drinking...I got about 3 shots in and then Chris Dinofrio(sp), Matt Wilson, Justin Baumgardner, and Gary(Chris's cousin) all came to the door. And I saw all these boys, and I was like...who are these people?!? Then they started walking in and I look at the kid in the back and I was like...OMFG THAT'S JUSTIN!!!!!!!! We haven't seen eachother in years, I swear...so I hugged him and they all came in and drank with us. Kristin was being the bartender...bad idea for me:) hahahahaha! I had some odd number shots of 99 berries...that shit kicked my ass. Justin and all them left and about a half hour later...after I sat on the porch and kissed Russell and told him I liked him? I was in the bathroom puking:) Kristin came in and took care of me. Russell kept coming in to see if I was ok...and I was like Jesus Christ! leave me the fuck alone! So Kristin yelled at me. And she was like...I think you hurt Russell's feelings. And I covered my face and I was like...IIII don'ttt knoww whatttt I wanttttt...and started balling. I cried for about an hour and a half about everything possible. Ashley, Nick...the boys that are in love with me. Then I decided that I wanted to talk to Josh Shields so I tried looking in my phone for the number he called me from...I could barely see, hahahaha...but I couldn't get ahold of him. So I called Justin balling, and he was like...I'm on my way! So I layed out the bathroom floor crying to Kristin and Justin finally got there and he sat down and I layed my head in his lap and stopped crying, haha. Then I got up and went downstairs. Everyone was telling me that Russell puked then passed out on Josh's mom's bed. Brandon Rhodes came later...I was so relieved. We went in Josh's sister's room and talked about Danny and stuff. It felt good to talk to him about it...then we went to sheetz and he got me a smuffin. I could barely see the mto screen, hahaha...I was still drunk. Then we went back to Josh's and all that..Brandon left. So we all sat around..me and Chris argued a few times, haha. Jon Polio came to hang out...then we all went to sleep. Josh and I had some talks, it was kind of nice. Then we got up at 9 and Tom brought me and Kristin home. I slept for about 2 seconds, got up and hung out with my mom then went to my family reunion and got to see all my family&lt;33 Then I went home with Aunt Lori, Uncle Vern, Erica, and Ariel to stay there for the week.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Monday- Woke up and got dressed and stuff. Then we had to take Ariel to cheerleading practice at 11. She had it from 11-1 so me and my aunt walked on this path thing for 3 miles...it only took us 45 minutes, so we went inside and watched Ariel since we had nothing else to do. After that we went to Wal Mart and got some things then ate at Wendy's:) On our way home we were stopped at a light and some lady rearended my aunt. She has a Lincoln Aviator and this girl had a Saturn...needless to say, her car was f'ed up and my aunt was pissed cause the girl hit her Lincoln! So they exchanged info and all that then we had to go pick up Erica and Sami Jo cause they had cheerleading. Ariel and I went swimming when we got home...it was fun, but she made me race her 80 times and she's like a fish so she beat me:) yes...my lovely 10 year old cousin beat me! hahahaha! So then we dried off and stuff and I got in the shower and stuff. Then we went and picked up Erica from cheerleading and brought Sami Jo home. I talked online for a little bit and went to bed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Tuesday-Woke up and made Erica go swimming with me. I layed out on the raft for an hour then did 50 laps. She got out after like 15 minutes, haha...so I swam alone most of the time. Then I got out and got a shower and all that. We all got ready...aunt Lori came home from work and we all went to Apollo moonlanding(their carnival there). We picked up Tiffany...she's Erica's friend but I have known her since we were little from being in Apollo every weekend. But I saw my dad's g/f's daughter Ashley...talked to her some, but she's weird so I walked away, hahaha! It was alright...I didn't know many people so it wasn't as fun for me. But I met all of Erica's little friends, they're so cute and nice. Then we went home and I watched tv and talked online and all that jazz then went to sleep. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Wednesday- Woke up since it was cleaning day and helped clean. I washed the mirrors and windows. Then Ariel, Erica, and I put our bathing suits on and aunt Lori took us to the Apollo pool. It was freezing...oh boy. Met some more of Erica's friends and hung out with them. There was a boy there and he was really hott, haha. He kept looking at me...made me feel good. But it got real boring so we went home. Erica decided she wanted to go to the carnival again so we all got ready and Erica, Ariel, and I all went to the carnival. Erica walked away from me and Ariel with her friends...I was angry! So Ariel and I walked around looking for her friend Lindsay that she was supposed to hang out with. Walked around with a few of Erica's friends for a little...without Erica though. Then Erica and Courtney&lt;33(love that girl) walked around with us and we finally found Lindsay so Ariel left with her. I saw Moose...I love that man, he always goes with us to Poconos, which happens to be next weekend:) :) :) So we talked about Poconos and stuff then he had to go find his wife, hahaha! I also saw my cousin Korry's cousins...KJ and Adam, they also go to Poconos. KJ is a beautiful man, oh boy, hahaha! So then we got picked up and went home. Got online and fought with people for a while...cried because I miss Josh and when I'm upset I want to talk to him, and that was out of the question. But oh well...friends will come and go, I'm not letting it bother me. So then I finally went to bed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Thursday- Finally woke up at 11:30...Ariel was mad at me cause she was bored, hahaha! Erica got her belly button pierced and so did Courtney...they were so excited. Ariel had cheerleading from 5-7 so we went and picked up Taylor(Ariel's friend) and went to cheerleading. We didn't want to sit there so my aunt Lori, Erica, Courtney and I all went a looked in stores and got Erica stuff to clean her belly button. We killed about an hour and 45 minutes so we only had to wait 15 minutes for Ariel and Taylor. Then we ordered pizza, got Taylor's bathing suit and picked up Sami Jo&lt;33(love her too) Went home, ate pizza and all the girls went swimming. Me and my aunt Lori sat outside and watched them and talked forever. Then we all watched ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen""...it was sooo cute, I liked it. Then we put in ""Bringing Down the House"" but barely watched it cause we showed our cheerleading dances and my aunt braided the girls hair. Finally we went to Erica's room to go to bed...didn't go to bed forever, but we went in her room, haha! I slept on the top bunk, Erica and Courtney slept in Erica's bed, and Sami Jo slept on the floor. Erica wouldn't stop talking forever and Courtney was just falling asleep while Erica was talking, haha. Then Sami Jo and Erica had an arguement about the tv being on while we were falling asleep. THEN&nbsp; Sami Jo turned off the fan cause she said it was making noise, 2 seconds later I woke up and I was like...I'm dying who turned off the fan!?!?!?! So she turned it back on and I went back to sleep. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Today-Got up at 9:45...well I was woken up by my aunt. Said good-bye to Sami Jo and Courtney:( Then I got dressed and made sure I had everything packed. We all left, dropped Erica and Ariel off at their grandparents cause my aunt and uncle's anniversary is this weekend so they're going to Oglebay for the weekend. I said good-bye to them and we left. My uncle Vern, aunt Lori, and I all talked the whole hour and a half drive to SR about everything possible, haha...it was nice though. Got here and they stayed and talked to my sister for a few minutes then left. I got online and thats where I am now. I'm not sure what I'm doing tonight...alot of people want to hang out, but I don't know if I want to. We'll see. But I'm out:) Peace it kids.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1>Don't tell Ashley though, she'll get mad at me...nice line from a friend, huh?! hahahaha! RIGHT.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=1>P.S.-I'm fat...oh well, you'll have that;-) Grow up you little bitch, remember...you don't want to be with him, you wrote a poem about it! hahahaha!</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>So yesterday me and my mom went to the movies. We ate at McDonalds first then went to Clearview to see Shrek 2. It was pretty cute...the first one was better in my opinion. I drove to Wal Mart:) I even parked that bitch!!!! wooo hooo!!!! Anyways, we went there so I could get shampoo, conditioner, razors, and shaving cream for my trip to MD with Amber. Well lets just say that was a waste cause when we got outside I called Amber to see if she had talk to Mary to see when we were leaving and she told me I could no longer go. I was like...uhh awesome!!!! So yeah, ANYWAYS. I drove home and on our way my mom called my aunt Lori. And I was like...mom!!!! Tell aunt Lori that I'll come stay for a week now! Therefore...I am going to stay at my Uncle Vern and Aunt Lori's house this whole week with my awesome cousins...Erica(13) and Ariel(10). They have an inground pool and they're rich:) My aunt Lori still owes me a makeover from my 16th birthday so she said we can go do that:) :) So after the family reunion on Sunday I'll just go home with them and stay there til either next Saturday or Sunday. It should be exciting. Today I did nothing...sat on the computer all day and downloaded music. Tomorrow I'll probably go to Glenn's with&nbsp; my mom and go swimming with Devan and Chelsea or something. Other then that...who knows. Then Sunday I'm going to the family reunion with my dad at Armco park. We get to eat lots of food and go swimming at Armco, so its cool...plus I get to see my family whom I never see:) :) :) Joshua is supposed to call me tonight...he actually gets to go out and do stuff on the weekends cause he's off duty, which is cool for him. But I'm out...peace it kids.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Yesterday Danny, Eric, Nate, and Amber all came over. We pretty much just sat around and watched tv and talked...fun times I must say. Then I got hungry so Danny, Amber, and I went to Subway. Flea was working so I payed barely anything for my food. We ate there so Flea had company cause he had no costumers. Amber went outside with him while he smoke a cigarette...he told her that he likes me:-\ Odd I must say...oh well. So we ate and all that then came back to my house. Sat around some more. Joshua Shields called me from where he's based<FONT color=#ffff00>:) :) :)</FONT> He made it there ok and he was getting ready to go to the movies with some of the kids he met in basics. I miss him already:( Then Josh Thompson texted me from Ocean City:) We texted eachother back and fourth a few times...I'm sure gonna miss him! We won't get to see eachother for 12 days or more:( But anyways...Amber and I had to be at her house by 11 so around 10:45 we made Danny take us. We got online for a bit and ""someone"" I haven't talked to since school was out talked to me and he had a story to tell me so he called me. We talked for like a half hour, it was nice to talk to him again. He was gonna come over today but things came up and he couldn't. So I went to sleep when I got home at like 10...I didn't sleep well at Amber's so I didn't get up til like 3. My mom called and we decided that we would go see Shrek 2 at 6:45 to spend some time together since I leave for Maryland either tomorrow or Saturday. Then we're going to Wal Mart to get me shower stuff for my trip. Yupp, so thats what my day will consist of...tomorrow, I'm either leaving for Maryland or getting ready to, haha. But I'm out, see ya kids.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>Well yesterday I thought that I wouldn't do anything all day so I didn't take a shower right away. I talked to Amber online all day and we had a&nbsp;long talk about Danny...kinda made me think about some things.&nbsp;Then Josh told me that him and Tom were coming over. I needed to do laundry real bad cause I had no clothes, haha. So I hurried and gathered the laundry and put some in the washing machine. Then I told Kristin to come over and she did. Then I went and got a shower and got dressed and stuff. I didn't bother blow drying my hair cause I'm lazy. Josh and Tom&nbsp;got here and we sat around for a bit. Then Mike called and him and Chris Raab came over. Oagr called Josh and said he was coming, so he came over too. Mike and Chris had beer so them and Kristin got drunk. Kristin got drunk off of one beer&lt;3 I love her, haha!!!!! She's one of my best friends...I mean my ""breast friend"" Yes our 34d's make us breast friends! Gotta love that! So we all sat there and talked about sex...it was hilarious. All my parties seem to end up all about sex talks...but its interesting, hahaha! Around 12:30 Josh came over to say good-bye. He had all his friends with him which pissed me off like whoa...so he made them go down to the car. We sat outside and talked...I sat on his lap and I hugged him and needless to say...I started balling, to the point where I couldn't breathe. He was like...Ashley, calm down...I'll be back. And I was like...what if you die?! (still crying uncontrollably) But I got my composure and we talked and stuff and he came inside to say bye&nbsp; to&nbsp;my brother then I hugged him one last time and told him I loved him and all that. It sucked real bad. So I went and sat online. Then Josh, Kristin, Chris, and I went outside and sat on the chairs and BSed forever. We decided that we were tired and came inside and went up to my mom's room and then Kristin and Mike were fighting so Kristin went home and Chris and Mike left. So me and Josh watched music videos then went to sleep. Jesse woke me up at like 11 cause Josh was on the phone...he told me that his flight was cancelled so he had to wait another hour and a half in Cincinatti airport. Then I actually woke up and moved around at 1:30, haha. I talked online all day and cleaned the whole house because everyone trashed it. Nice of them, huh?! Then my mom got home and ordered pizza. We all ate together...my brother, mom, sister, and Jesse. It was fun cause we talked alot about family stuff. Russel called me today and asked what I was doing and stuff. He just texted me so I dunno if we're gonna do something or what. Tomorrow me, Amber, Danny, and Eric might hang out...depending on what they're doing. Other then that, I don't know. But I'm out.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=1>So ummm I love my life:) My friends are the best people in the world...haha, just thought I'd let everyone know that. Last night I went and picked up Amber and we got all pretty and stuff. Then Tom and Joshua came over. They hung out with us for a bit then went to GC to get food cause they're fat boys. So me and Amber sat around online and stuff. Kristin and Mike came over to hang out. THEN Russell called me<FONT color=#ff0000>&lt;3</FONT> He was like, do you want me to come over? And I was like...uhh yes! So I sort of gave him directions but he was confused so he said he'd call when he got in SR. We sat around and then Russell called and he went too far, haha...so I told him to go to Dominos and we would meet him down there. Amber and I walked down there and he drove us back up. Tom and Josh pulled in at the same time so I ran over to Tom screaming. We all walked up the hill and went inside. Then Tom whipped out the whiskey:) It was exciting! So we got our drink on and we ran out pretty quick, haha. So Mike was like...give me money and I'll go buy beer so like 3 of us pitched in money to get beer and Mike, Josh, Amber, and Kristin all went to Ginger Hill and got Miller High Life. I hate beer but I wanted to get drunk so I had like 4 of those on top of a few shots. Needless to say...I got pretty drunk and enjoyed my night! Russell had to go to work at 6 this morning so he left around 1 or something like that. I walked him down to his truck and we talked for a few minutes then he left. I came back inside and drank more. We all goofed around and shit. I talked online to Danny, Brandon, and Eric Rogers. Got bitched at the whole time to get off cause I wasn't hanging out with everyone, haha. I definitely don't remember everything I said to anyone...you'll have that though:) So finally I got off and I was so tired...so me and Josh went upstairs and kicked Mike, Kristin, and Amber out of my mom's bed cause thats where my ass was sleeping! So I got ready for bed and all that. And of course...Josh doesn't know what sleep is so we were up forever...I'm not even sure what time we went to sleep. Got up at 1 cause we're lazy and Kristin helped me clean&lt;3 Then I called Josh and he said he was coming to get me...so I had no time to shower and I just put clothes on and he came. We went to his sister's house so he could say bye to his nephew since he leaves tomorrow to go to where he's being based. Then we went to his house and I helped him pack some stuff and I was hungry so we got pepperoni rolls. After that I went to wash my hands in the sink and there were squirt guns so I filled them up and started squirting him. We both got 2 of them and were chasing eachother around the house squirting eachother...I got soaked because he has a better aim then I do. Then we dried off and sat there for a bit and he brought me home. So thats where I am now...possibly going to call Russell cause Tom told me I should. Other then that I don't think I'm doing anything tonight. Tomorrow morning I'm going to the airport with Josh and his mom to say good-bye to him. Then who knows what. But I'm out for now:) Peace it kids.</FONT></P>

"event","Well...yesterday was ALMOST a waste of a day because I was soooo tired. I got up at 1:30 and ate and talked online for a bit then at like 2:30 I went in my mom's bed and watched tv and fell asleep til like 4:45. So I got up and got in the shower cause I'm cool like that. Got out and got online and Tom asked me if I wanted to go to the movies and I said sure why not. So I asked Kristin if she wanted to come with me and she said sure. Tom asked Josh and Christy then Brandon Rhodes. So I finished getting ready and Brandon came and got me and Kristin. Then we went to the park to see if Nicole was still at her game, but we didn't see her or her car so we went to the Warehouse to see Danny. We stayed there for like 2.5 seconds and then we went to Tom's. We sat there for a little bit and I was f'n hungry so Brandon took me and Kristin to McDonalds:) The kid that was working didn't make us pay as much as we should have cause he knew Brandon...and he was like ""If you weren't pretty, I wouldn't have done that"" haha...and he was gay:) Then some Nate kid came in and he sat and ate with us. We left and all that and when we got back to Tom's house Christy and Josh were there so we left for the movies. We got there and they came outside and asked us if we were there to see the 10:30 Spider Man 2 and we said yes, and she told us it was broken but we could go to the 9:45 one cause it was still in previews. So we did. Kristin and I had to pee so we went pee and I tried to get lipgloss out of a machine but the damn thing wouldn't work so I wasted 75 cents damnit!!!!!! hahaha. So we went back to the movie and watched it and all that. During it me and Brandon were texting eachother. So when it was over, we left and Josh and Christy were hungry so we all went to Eat 'n Park and I got a strawberry milkshake and a garden salad cause I wasn't hungry. We had some uh....interesting talks while we were there. Kind of embarrassing, but you'll have that! ANYWAYS...so we went back to Tom's and Brandon left after a little bit. And we talked online...no one was on, so I decided I wanted to go to bed. Tom made us a bed on the living room floor. So me and Kristin slept together;)<3 haha. Got woken up by Mike telling us that Tom's dad was pissed. So me, Kristin, Josh, and Christy all got up and cleaned up the living room. Sat outside for a bit, I was hungry so I ate cereal. Brad, Tom's little brother, had fireballs...so I had one and bitched the whole time that it was hot. Then Tom brought me and Kristin home and me and Kristin talked to my brother for a bit then she left. And now I'm here...probably going to call Josh to see what he's doing today and possibly hang out with him:)

"event","Well I talked to Danny on the phone last night because...well I don't know. But it was cool. So I went to bed at 2:30 and got up at 7:45 because my mom made me. It took me about 15 minutes to actually get up and moving. So I ate then got in the shower and got ready. Then we went to Butler and I got my permit:) So I drove from Butler to Glenn's house. I went swimming and layed out all day at Glenn's...it was wonderful. I got darker of course:) I also ate a whole lot because...well I'm a fat kid! haha. I talked online a bit there and I played with Devan...little shit. So then I was really f'n tired so I made my madre leave. My happy ass drove us home!!! I was so proud of myself. I honked the horn past Jamo's house cause I'm cool like that. Then I parallel parked...it wasn't too hott, but it wasn't that bad. So as soon as I walked in, I had a pop sicle and talked to my bro and my mom for like 5 minutes then walked upstairs and went to sleep in my mom's bed. That was at like 7:30 and around 8ish Kristin Linski<33 called me and we talked for a little while. It was good cause I miss her already...and Florida of course. She asked me if I have talked to Colin and I said no...and she was like...wtf?!?! haha...oh well, you'll have that. We got off the phone and I took my happy ass back to bed:) I was sooo tired, I slept til 10:30. Cause I got 6 hours of sleep and then I swam all day...wore me out. So I got up...made food, and got online. Kinda got pissed a little bit, but I'm not gonna talk about it:) Joshua Thompson IMed me and made it all better because he's awesome like that. Talked to Ben Watson...miss that kid a little bit, haha. And then TOM got on and I IMed him...haven't hung out in 2 days, we're all going through withdrawls. You can't just hang out with people like 4 days in a row then skip 2 days...it doesn't work that way! Well tomorrow...nothing planned, might hang out with Joshua Shields...who knows. But I'm out for now. Peace it browskis(miss you Eric mf Rogers)

"event","Well yesterday I went to Glenn's house with my mom. When I got there I put on my bathing suit and Chelsea went swimming with me. I layed on the raft and got tan:) Then my mom came in and she was in there for like 5 minutes and it started pouring down rain. So me and Chelsea stayed in and I got REALLYYY cold from the rain. But then it stopped so we swam some more and it started again so we just got out. I dryed off and we went upstairs and watched some of Blue Crush and then we ordered ""You Got Served"" on paperview. I got online while we were watching that and talked to Amber and Tom. Tom decided he was going to have a party since he couldn't find one to go to. So I asked Amber to go with me and gram said no. So after we ate I made my mom take me home. Before I got in the shower I got online and Amber's away message said she could come so I got all excited and shit:) So I got in the shower and got ready and all that jazz. Then Mike and Tom picked me up and we went and got Amber. And on our way back to Mercer Tom's mom called and wanted him to go to his aunt's and get the Nine Inch Nails DVD in Ferdona, so we had to drive there. Then we went to Tom's and Oagr, Renee, Josh, Christy, and Tom's cousin Megan were all there in the pool. So me, Amber, and Tom sat by the fire that Tom made. Josh decides that he's going to take a running jump into the pool from the side...well he slips 2 feet before he gets there and runs right into the side of the pool and fell on the ground...oh God it was priceless!!!!! So he walked back inside and when he walked back out he goes...Mike I think I broke 8 ribs, but it was Tom, not Mike...so Tom was like..yeah, I'm Tom...in a serious voice. I starting laughing histarically, guess you had to be there. Well then everyone got out of the pool and came and sat by the fire with us. And we started talking about the Josh story again and I started laughing AGAIN about what Tom said for about another 5 minutes. Well then everyone started leaving and Brandon Rhodes came. So then me, him, Amber, and Tom all went to some Amanda girl's house cause she had people there. Well it was fucking dumb so us 4 went to my house and sat there like it was more fun:) I rode with Brandon because I love his truck and his system. He says I'm only his friend because of his truck...kids these days. So then we sat here, the boys watched tv and me and Amber ate and talked online, haha. Brandon left, Amber went to sleep, I sat online a little longer and went to bed, and so did Tom. Woke Amber up at 10 cause her grandma called and her and Tom left and I went back to sleep til like 2 cause I was dead. So then I called Josh and I got ready. He came and picked me up and we went to the mall and he bought clothes from AE. Then we ate at the steak place and then went to the Butler fair. We rode one ride and then went to sit in the grand stands for the dem. derby. Watched 4 heats of that then left. Saw some people on the way out, talked to them then he brought me home, and now I'm here. Tomorrow I'm finally getting my freaking permit for sure...hoorah for me.

"event","Hmm...yeah, so last night was DEFINITELY interesting. Where to start? Well, Tom and Mike came and got me...none of my friends ended up coming with me, what a surprise! So yeah...needless to say...I was the only girl there. WOO HOO!!!!! Anyways, so me, Mike, Josh, and Oagr all watched Tom work on his car for awhile...pretty damn exciting I must say. So then me and Oagr took a Country Fair run and when we were walking out...Gabany, Eric, and some Nate kid were sitting there. So they followed us back to Josh's and everyone chilled there. I got wasted...Tom took shots off my bellybutton...other shit happened, pretty interesting night. So I found some shit out about Danny and Eric and 2 other girls. Yeah, I was flipping out almost the whole night. Tom, Gabany, and Oagr were all telling me to calm down and stuff, haha. Thanks boys:) You helped me alot. Tom was like..just take another shot, you'll be ok, haha. So after I found that shit out, Danny called me. Yeah he definitely got shit from me. I was flipping out and they were all like...damn you owned him, ha! And then I was just flipping out, and they were like...you're on a role tonight. But after I calmed down and had a few more shots I called Danny back so I could actually talk to him about it in a calm fashion. I kinda forgave him because we're not together anymore and it was by my choice so I just don't give a fuck. It's not worth my time to be mad about it forever...I mean, I think about it and get pissed but then I'm like...oh well, he is a male. But then him and Brandon Rhodes came to Josh's and I was sitting at the computer with Gabany. But eventually I got up and I took Danny outside so we could talk face to face. So we sat out on the steps for a while and talked and then we went back inside. He sat in the other room and I went and sat on the chair with Gabany. Then Eric wanted to leave so Gabany, Eric, and Nate left. So then Danny and Brandon wanted to leave and I kinda didn't want to stay at Josh's so I went with them and just spent the night at Danny's. I got up around 12:30 and Danny took me home around 1:30...we didn't talk all the much in the car, ha! So yeah, now I'm here. Oh yes, and I was so pissed last night and the only person that could make me feel better because she can relate was Amber, so we made up. I just don't think its worth being mad over anymore, I'm over it. But yeah...my night was definitely interesting. So today I'm going to hang out with Joshua...he said he's making dinner, haha. It should be fun. Tomorrow I'm going to my padre's for my cousin Gary's b-day party. It should be a good time since I haven't seen my family in a long time. Well, I'm fresh out of info...haha, so I'm out.

"event","Hmm so I was bored and decided to make a journal...soo here it goes. Tuesday me and Jamo went to Mike Shelestak's with him and Tom Davanzo(Mercer kids for those who don't know). We played pool then we drove the golf cart and 4wheelers. I almost killed Mike a few times on the golf cart then I f'ed up the gears when i was trying to shift on the 4wheeler! hahaha. Then I was driving Tom around on the golf cart and we sat by the road and when a car would go by I would honk the golf cart horn at them, hahaha! Then we went to DAIRY QUEEN, beautiful place I might add...and I flicked white shit all over me, needless to say I got made fun of. So then we left and went to the Warehouse to watch Danny ride for a bit. Then Mike and Tom brought us home and Jamo called Lillie and she came over:) Then we went to Jamo's and got her 99 apples and came back here and got drunk, haha. Then Danny and Brandon came over for a bit to hang out with our drunk asses. After they left me and Jamo left Lillie's drunk bum on the couch and went to Sheetz for mto's. Came back here and ate them then went to bed. Yesterday I woke up and Jamo and Lillie left and I went and layed out for a while. Then Joshua came over and we went to Tattoo U to look at tattoos for him. Came home, he left and Kristin came and hung out with me for a while. Then I got on the computer and around 8:30 I was tired as shit so I took at nap til 10! woo hoo, I'm dangerous. So then I sat on the computer some more and Danny called around 12:30 and I talked to him til 4 in the freaking morning...it was nice though, we talked about alot of shit. So then I woke up at 11 and got ready to go lay out. Layed out til 12:30...talked online a bit, showered, and went to Butler...which was a waste because I needed my mom with me. So I'm back here and I'm waiting to see if Jeh-dawg can come with me to Josh Thompson's with Tom. Therefore I will have stories about that tomorrow! haha. I'm out...peace it browskis(yeah Eric mf Rogers!)

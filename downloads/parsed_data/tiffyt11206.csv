My husband has generously agreed to share his computer with me and so I have started over again with a new fresh install of all my games and expansions except for the latest two expansions. Maybe I'll get them next week. Or a new computer. After all my birthday is coming up quickly. But I'm drooling for one of those new hp smart touch pc's. I wonder how the sims would play on that though...</font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080"">Anywhoo, this is my latest and only blog that I'll be updating now. I have abandoned my other efforts and unfortunately my beautiful Medieval neighborhood New Cornwall is on my other dead pc. I believe the hard drive is still intact and if I can manage it I will try to salvage it when possible as I don't want to give up on that particular neighborhood. It was fun and I want to continue that blog.</font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080"">This blog now is for my neighborhood on my hubbys pc called Scarlett Wind City. I will be updating more when I have time. I'm trying to get my information and databases sorted out right now. I plan to do all that on my laptop so my hubby has computer time and I don't want to monopolize it constantly. <br /></font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080"">I was on the Isle of Thyme blog before it went poof and was duly impressed. Reading other peoples sims stories and blogs has gotten me to want to do something as good as that. I will of course be posting stories as well but they will be longer updates and fewer chapters. I haven't decided how I am going to set it up yet though. I was thinking I could do it like Tiffs Ravenous series but I have a thing about not wanting to ever end stories. I like the soap opera type stories that continue for an interminable amount of time. I was also thinking of doing episodes and seasons like Deception Pass. I am as yet undecided and as I wont be posting anything for a bit I'll just relax and finish up my behind the scenes stuff.</font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080"">I think I have rambled on enough for now though so I will say ttfn and *poof*</font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080""><br /></font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080"">~TiffyT</font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080""><br /></font></p><p><font size=""4"" color=""#800080"">P.S. My wordpress blogs will be moved and/or deleted eventually.&nbsp; *am very lazy on laptop*</font><br /></p>"

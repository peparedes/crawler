"event","I just spent this morning and part of this afternoon reading my past journal entries. Only about 220 of them. Wow, I was ridiculously pathetic. 


The last time I made a post similar to the way this one is starting, I hardly reread any of it. I just read all posts since the summer before my senior year in high school. This time I am beginning to see a much larger picture... helps when you read more than just a few things. Not like it was a bad thing though, because I read them before I sent out my apology message... I'd say that was one of the best things I ever did in my life... Well, so far. 

I was super depressed then... and super vengeful. I hate the way I sounded. I threatened anyone and everyone lol. Like, really. I'm kind of embarrassed about it, to be honest. And so many people put up with me. Blah. I was such a loser! Whatever. 3plus years later, I'm all the better for it. I've learned a lot about growing the fuck up. 

I've realized lately how much I've forgotten from that time period. Let's just say it's a LOT. Reading all my past entries helped me fill a few holes I couldn't figure out. I remembered being a super bitch and treating people like crap, but now I have the thinking behind these actions. Not all of them, not at all... but a few important ones. Through reading my posts, I realized that I write cryptic as hell. No wonder things got confused all the time.

I'm happier now than I have been in many many many years. My relationship with my sister is better than ever. I'm making much better choices. I am making some very important life choices right now. I'm very happy!!!!

My fingers smell like bleach and my body is feeling hot as hell. I feel the sweat. I just got back from my oil change. I asked the guy if they had any good deals and because their boss wasn't there (and I can kind of be very sweet when I want to be) ... I managed to get 21 dollars off!! Yay!


Phew, it's so bloody hot. I would really love to write a big long post but I need to just get ready for the road trip tomorrow. I'm excited to go. 


omg... andy is online talking to me. weirdness. 




for the record, I am in love."

Life update. I love my life right now. in many aspects. I know what I am going to do for a career. I am so excited. I really cannot even put it into words here. This will be something that makes me VERY happy. I will be my own boss, I can be creative in MANY MANY ways that I never thought possible. Bah. YAY!

I am so damn tired. 

it had been a week and I felt it was time to write again... unfortunately only for a few lines as I can hardly see straight. Bah.

"event","I am confused to the depth of my soul. 

The guy I was with for three years expects miracles from me. I gave him my all. For three years. I put up with a lot. I put up with mental abuse. I put up with the occasional physical harm. He asked me at least once a week if I wanted to break up. Every time he did something that hurt me, he somehow turned it around on me. I was the one apologizing. I was the one ""making deals."" I wanted him to stay with me. I virtually had to sell my soul to make him stay. I saw what was underneath this silly tough guy facade. He kept that from me. Told me that he loved me, although now I know he didn't. Not really. I see now that I fooled myself. I mean, how could a person possibly believe that someone who acts like they hate you so much actually love you? I should have seen it all those times. I should have noticed two years ago. I did everything for him. EVERYTHING. I got very little in return. We've had some good times. A lot of fun. Right now all I can think about all the bad things. I've been concentrating so much on those good moments that I blinded myself to my pain. I was told I was fat, and ugly. He always talked to girls online. Always. Made me feel less of a person. I didn't really notice it anymore. I started to feel fat. I started to feel unworthy. I'm not fat. I'm not unworthy. He coerced me into trying things that I never would have even come across on my own. That's not me. I don't do those things. I was so depressed. He was lazy, never picked up after himself... never helped clean... never even made his own meal. He expected me to take care of everything. All the while telling me what a stupid piece of crap I was. He told me for two something years that I was stupid. I knew I wasn't stupid. I am actually very intelligent. I finally started thinking about myself in the past month. How I don't like who I am or what I am becoming. Just because you love a person, doesn't mean you have to deal with all that to be with them. I love him. very much. I just cannot handle what I have become. I have been molded, I allowed myself to be molded. I didn't notice it was happening. I just slowly allowed parts of my to change. First it was my clothes. He told me it was immature and childish. I came to agree with him. I dressed like anyone else. That is changing now. I am bringing myself back. I've been working on that part for awhile now. When I first met him, I told him I don't yell. Because I never did. I guess he took that as a challenge. He would pick and pick and pick and pick until I blew up. I would freak out over nothing. He knew exactly how to push my buttons to get that out of me. He told me often that his entire goal of dating me was to break the person that I am. I still don't understand why I put up with that. I really don't. It confuses me more now that my eyes are wide open. He just seemed to think everything I was was dumb and immature and uncool. I just really liked him. He is smart and good-looking. At first he was very charming, very polite. We moved in together after dating a month, knowing each other a month. We've lived many places. The worst started in Redmond. He started threatening to not live with me after our lease was up. To be honest I don't remember much from that time. I tend to block out painful moments... and I have a bad memory. He liked to make me jealous then. The only time he ever cleaned was the day he had an old gf pick him up for lunch. He never told me about it. Well, I kind of figured it out... I don't remember how. He never would have told me. We moved from Redmond to the bottom floor of a house in South Seattle. That's when it really started. Well, that's when it got a lot worse. The place went to hell very quickly. He had no job, I was working many many many hours as a manager at a Sally Beauty Supply near Bothell. I was stressed. I would come home and not want to do anything. He would expect me to clean and cook. I didn't do much of that. I was depressed. Everything got worse and worse. He brought people over that had a negative effect on our life. He brought things into our household and lives that made things worse. A lot worse. Things that I will think about with a sick stomach until I die. I made some pretty terrible choices. Choices the Real Christine never would have made. It's funny what you'll do when you are unhappy with yourself. I hated my job. I hated me. I still loved him. I put up with a lot. He held me up to a wall by my throat in front of a friend. Our friend did nothing. He would tell me I was stupid. and lazy. and other things. I felt shitty. I felt lonely. That opened a door that caused the room mate to think he could make a move on me. He kissed me one night. I didn't know what to think. I was so depressed. I didn't want that kiss. I just wanted love and attention from the one I loved. The guy who didn't show me he cared about me at all. I hid the fact because I was ashamed. He found out anyway. He made everything my fault. He only changed his verbally abusive ways for a small time. Then it got worse. We argued every single day. He continued to ask me if he wanted to break up. I kept saying no, although I'm confused as to why. I just know I didn't want to lose him. I kept making deals with him to get him to not leave me. I didn't know that he really wouldn't have left. He finally got a job. A full time job. I was so proud. I bragged about this new job to everyone. My whole family couldn't figure out why I supported him before. I just brushed it all away, I never listened. Anyway, his new job helped take a lot of the financial stress away. He just felt that he could spend MORE money. For about 4 months or so before he got his job we did some pretty stupid shit. And I kept doing it until I realized that something besides myself was in control. I couldn't handle it. I freaked out. Literally. Bawled. Hated myself. I was so ashamed. I quit those things and most everything else. Not long after that, I figured out I was pregnant. I was still so depressed. Somehow I managed to be apathetic about it. I really don't know how I did that. I was the girl that said that even if I got raped, I would have the child and give it up to a couple who couldn't have children and would love it. I just shoved it all in that little dark hole where I hid all my pain. I couldn't have the child. I could hardly take care of myself. He was leaving me. He finally decided he wanted to live with other people. I'd known nothing else for the two years before that. He said it would be better for us. That we could get along better. It was August when I went to the doctors. I had it ""taken care of."" I felt nothing. I just took my pain killers that they gave me. I have problems with pills. They are just so easy. Anyway, I can't figure out how I was so apathetic about it. It was something I had always felt so strongly about. I knew I couldn't take care of it properly. Like I said, I couldn't even care for myself. It wouldn't have been right. Well, the end of August I moved into my Dad's apartment. I quit Sally's at the beginning of August. I wanted to start school in the fall. I knew I would be able to work better living with my Dad vs. Jeremy. The problem was, Jeremy and I had been together EVERY SINGLE DAY for two years. I don't think we knew how to deal with being apart. He wanted me to spend the night all the time. I felt obligated to. Not because I didn't want to, don't get me wrong. I felt so bad on different levels. I felt I was abandoning Jeremy if I didn't come over, yet I felt guilty for asking my dad if I could live there and then never be there. Jeremy's mom gave me a cat. That was when I was finally able to spend more time at home. Jeremy started getting jealous of my cat. He didn't want me to live with him, but he would make me feel guilty for being at home. I didn't understand. When I got there we would fight. All the time. I was so stressed. I was starting school, I had a kitten, I was trying to be a grown up. I got a part time job. We continued to have problems, the fighting didn't stop. I found out recently that about Xmas time, he was looking around for someone else. He was getting naked pictures of girls from craigslist by pretending to have a dirty movie company. He also created a Match.com account, something I never would have thought of him having. (Oh, I forgot to mention Paige. It was a co-worker from when we lived in South Seattle. He led her on and she had no clue of my existence. He would have hours of conversation with her, and she never knew about me. Not until our 2 year anniversary when I made him tell her. She stopped talking to him shortly after that.) A couple months later he decided he needed to go on a road trip. He knew I worked and couldn't go. He said just himself and Tommy were going. He was going to visit a childhood friend in San Francisco. He said he needed some stress relief from work and needed to go then. He didn't call me the entire weekend. He made the time to send an email to his work to tell them he wouldn't be back until Tuesday instead of Monday. He never told me that. I had to find out from Tommy's brother that they weren't coming home until Tuesday morning. I was worried sick and couldn't figure out what I did to be ignored the entire weekend. I jsut didn't know. When he came back I went to his house at seven in the morning. He never told me anything about the trip. He just wouldn't tell me. I was interested as I'd never been there before. I was suspicious that maybe he cheated on me. He said no. He got mad at me for asking questions. Told me I was annoying and being stupid. One night at the bar, Tommy said something about thinking Natalie was nice. Natalie was the ""ex-girlfriend"" I had mentioned before that Jeremy went to lunch with when we lived in Redmond. I was like... uh... when did you meet her? Jeremy wasn't allowed to talk to her, as she was the girl he had been ""seeing"" when we met. When we started dating, she was to be out of the picture. Hey, I was a jealous girl. He wasn't actually allowed to talk to her because he lied to me about the lunch thing. Well, they said she came and visited one night or w/e and that Tommy liked her. So she came over one night to drink with us. Myself, Tommy, Jeremy and her. Well, Jeremy and I were upstairs. Tommy and Natalie were downstairs. They were talking SOOOO loud. I could hear EVERYTHING. They were at first talking about gross sexual things. Then they started talking about Joesph... Jeremy's childhood friend who lived in San Francisco. I was like... she shouldn't know Joesph. They were talking about the road trip. He invited this girl and her friend. They stayed in the same hotel room. Jeremy and Tommy slept (literally) with both girls. They lied. I flipped out. I confronted Jeremy and he yelled at them for being stupid. I was pissed. I was royally betrayed. I listened to her talk about how much she liked Jeremy. She lied straight to my face about shit I just heard her say. I was so fucking hurt. He went on a motherfucking road trip with an ex. Slept in the same bed as her. Left me hanging. Didn't call me the entire weekend. Left me worrying. For some reason I forgave him. I shouldn't have. He didn't see anything wrong with it. Like really, saw nothing wrong with it. I still can't believe I accepted it. I still loved him. I blamed her, and Tommy. Even though it wasn't their fault. Somehow I ended up being the one apologizing for shit. I don't ever remember what it was I apologized for... In April, a couple of weeks later, we went to Long Beach for a weekend. I had a lot of fun. He decided on that trip that he was going to move to Florida to take a job. I was proud. He was going to learn a bunch of things and be very successful. He went for two weeks. The longest I'd been away from him. He came back for a little while before I went down with him on his return trip. I stayed Thursday-Sunday. Before we left he said he went and did ceramics with some girl at the college. At three in the morning. That hurt. He made some female friend through craigslist, although his friend ended up taking off with her. Then we went down there. When I was trying to log into facebook, the email of some girl from the college was on the computer. I asked why it was there. He claims she kept coming over while he was back in Washington. Who knows. A couple weeks went by and some bad shit was happening down there. He called me and told me he was coming home. I had to be at the air port to pick him up. Hours before that, his old boss messaged me on aim. Told me about this girl he had been hanging out with. Sleeping in his bed. Over all the time. This girl jeremy told me kept telling him to dump me. He had been hanging out with her a lot more than I ever knew or that he told me. He had changed all his passwords. The old boss told me to look in his email because he had never seen someone try to hook up with other girls more in his life. I brought this up when I picked him up at the airport that night. He freaked out. And complained that I was listening to that ""crook"" or w/e. He was so pissed. I ended up apologizing for the questions. I said I still needed to see his email. He had put up craigslist ads to hang out with girls. He had chat conversations indicating that he met up with several of these people in the neighborhood. He had tons of responses. He swore up and down he never cheated on me. I guess maybe he would have eventually if he lived down there longer. His greed got ahold of him though. He wanted more and more money. It was scaring me. I didn't know that person. He had changed, money had changed him. He had hotel parties and who knows what else. I can never forget that. I can't trust anything about that time period. Every time I asked about it, I was yelled at and ended up apologizing. I just bottled up the pain and moved on. Who knows if he ever would have actually left me like he threatened so often. Well, then he was back. Same ol', same ol' though. He would talk to girls online. Telling them how much money he made. How beautiful they were, all while telling me how fat I was. It hurt. Some reason I put up with it. Told them he wished they were there so he could spoil them. I read it all. It's as though he wanted me to find these messages. It hurt. I didn't exist in this online life. He wanted to move the girl to Washington. Offered her a partnership. A million dollars. He is still working with her and probably still intends to have her come in the fall. Just thinking about the lack of concern about my feelings is astonishing. I wasn't ""hot enough"" for whatever this job was. Grr. It's so stupid, all this stuff I put up with. A few weeks ago, he decided to fall back on something that I thought would never be near me again. He actually tried making a deal with me that involved ME participating. I was so fucking offended. I was so HURT that he was more concerned to get high rather than my feelings. He knew it would hurt me. He knew. and fucking did it anyway. Brought it near me anyway. Knowing how much I would hate it. I can never forgive him for that. I didn't do it. I was strong. I hated it anyway... I am the only one to control my life. I started realizing that he was trying to control my life also. I don't LIKE anything to control me. Even him. He told me that he would only marry me if I became a doctor. He didn't believe I was capable... I hate being wrong. I finally started thinking that I didn't want to be a doctor. I could DO it. I am smart enough for it. I'd rather do something else though. He said that if I only aspire to be a restaurant owner, he doesn't want to be with me. His love was always conditional. I almost became anorexic again. I started hanging out with Crystal more. Just hanging out with her made me feel better. I need to be in control of myself and my life. I am going to be the one to deal with it until the end. I want to be doing something I enjoy during that time. I love him to death. I don't understand how he can expect me to just forgive. I shut off. He hurt me. Told me that it was his whole plan. See what it took to get me to break. I broke. It took a hell of a lot. But I had been shoving all that pain away. Hid it. Covered it up. I am so shut down. I am so baffled. He decides to break me and then be nice. He expects me to just FUCKING FORGIVE HIM for this pain. He assumes it would be so easy. I hurt so fucking bad. I can't even really put it into words how much I hurt right now. He's trying. I know he is. I just don't know how long that will last. It just hurts. I hurt from previous pain as well. It's all coming forward. Everyone is shut down and out. I need to deal with this pain on my own. I bought water colors today. I am going to paint soon. I just need to clean with Melissa first. I started writing this and just couldn't stop. It's taken me a very long time to write. I don't know yet if I am proud of it or not. There are parts of these past three years that I did not include. There are many things yet that bothered me that I think about sometimes. I have a feeling my fingers my hurt in the morning. I have to dress up a&nbsp; little bit for work tomorrow. Long story, don't want to write about it now. It would be nice to give it another chance, but I can't right now. I'm not in a right state of mind. I wouldn't be able to handle anything serious. I just need to surround myself with happiness. That is why we are cleaning right now. That is why I am going to get into my art again. I need to get everything out that I have contained in myself for 4 years. It sucks.&nbsp; I don't even know where to start. I think with flowers. :-) Flowers make me happy. Don't think I am angry or mad or sad or whatever. I just am. I am indifferent to most things right now. I don't know how I feel. I haven't figured it out yet. My mind is in a protective mode. Nothing comes in or out. I just want to enjoy life right now. I am abstaining from everything but the occasional smoke. I only do it if I'm stressed although unfortunately that has been often lately. 

Please don't over analyze anything I've written here. This is journal one of my life these past three years. I will recall things as time goes by. I will write about happier things some day. Right now they are neither happy nor sad. They are just what is and what was. 

Jeremy, I still love you. I just cannot be with you right now. I enjoy being your friend, because as friends we can have fun. I cannot get too close now. I am still in my little bubble. I will probably be there for awhile. I have lost trust in myself most of all. Thanks for being there for me. I am dealing with a lot. I have come up with some ways to get happy again, and this is one of those things. I will be honest and true here. It is me with my deepest thoughts. For as long as you can be accepting of me and what I'm going through, you can read into these private thoughts. If I feel threatened at all, I will make everything private to only myself. I need this outlet. I get uncomfortable talking about things right now. I feel vulnerable and I hate it.

well, I was thinking last night and this morning... well... I guess all of the thinking was done today... Just some was done before sleep and some after sleep... I realized that instead of dealing with what happened to me by Corey all those years ago, I shoved it away into some deep dark place. I never dealt with it. I just covered it all up and thought I was happy. Recently I was hurt. Actually, I allowed myself to be mentally abused for three years. I say ""allowed"" because I didn't realize until very recently what was going on. And I shut down. Like I did last time. Then I found someone who made me happy. Instead of working through my issues. Luckily it was realized before we did something stupid. Like throw it all away before making sure we were both okay. I still feel like shit. I've decided to let it come out though. I need to fix myself from a depth I never realized. It all came to the surface last night. All that pain. The pain of being second best. again. The pain I didn't deal with the first time. I drowned it with bad choices and other boys. 

I can't do that this time. I've grown up a lot. I just haven't dealt with shit. I'm over the guys, just not the pain. Except one. I've never gotten over him. He claims the same but I don't believe it anymore. I can only be his friend. I am okay with this. I can be nothing else right now. I'm too eff'd up for anything else right now. I broke it off with jeremy. I told him I can't be with him or anyone else right now. I gushed all the things wrong with me right now. I didn't explain how I came to these conclusions. I want to paint. I want to draw. I want to color. I want to be outside. I want to exercise. 

I want to be me. :-(



and right now my best friend is avoiding me. :-("

 If your back
 Was still aligned
 And your sheets
 Were growing grass
 All on the corners of your bed
 
 But you've got too much to wear
 On your sleeves
 It has too much to do with me
 And secretly
 I want to bury in the yard
 The grey remains of a friendship scarred
 
 You told us of your new life there
 You got someone coming round
 Gluing tinsel to your crown
 He's got you talkin' pretty loud
 
 You berate remember
 Your ailing heart and your criminal eyes
 You say you're still in love
 If it's true, what can be done?
 It's hard to leave all those moments behind
 
 Called to see
 If your back
 Was still aligned
 And your sheets
 All growing grass
 All on the corners of your bed
 
 But you've got too much to wear
 On your sleeves
 It has too much to do with me
 And secretly
 I want to bury in the yard
 The grey remains of a friendship scarred
 
 You've tested your metal of
 Doe's skin and petals
 While kissing the lipless
 Who bleed all the sweetness away
 



I'm not giving up this time. I ran away the last time and I regretted it... for three years I regretted it. You've lied to me now, but what is new. Everyone does it. It's like a requirement or something. I don't want to lose you but at the same time I don't want to push something that you don't want. I can understand all the feelings and doubts and whatifs. I don't think I'll be here next time. It just... hurts. I don't want to be second best.


          I'm heaven sent,
 don't you dare forget
 I am all you've ever wanted,
 what all the other boys all promised
 Sorry I told
 I just needed you to know
 
 I think in decimals and dollars
 I am the cause to all your problems
 Shelter from cold
 We are never alone
 Coordinate brain and mouth
 Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out
 I wish I knew
 
 I hope this songs starts a craze,
 the kind of song that ignites the airways
 The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are
 with who ever they're there with
 This is war
 Every line is about who I don't write about anymore
 Hope you come down with something they can't diagnose,
 don't have the cure for
 Holding on to your grudge
 Oh it's so hard to have someone to love
 Keeping quiet is hard
 'Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start
 At least pretend you didn't wanna get caught
 
 We're consentratin' on fallin' apart
 We were contenders, now throwin' the fight
 I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe in us
 
 Oh we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial
 We are entirely smooth
 We fit to the truth
 We are the best at what we do
 And these are the words you wish you wrote down
 This is the way you wish your voice sounds,
 handsome and smart
 Oh, my tongue's the only muscle on my body that works harder than my heart
 And it's all from watching TV
 and from speeding up my breathing
 Wouldn't stop if I could
 Oh it hurts to be this good
 You're holding on to your grudge
 Oh it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love
 Oh so let it go
 
 We're consentratin' on fallin' apart
 We were contenders, now throwin' the fight
 I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe in us
 
 We're consentratin' on fallin' apart
 We were contenders, now throwin' the fight
 I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe in us
 
 This is the craze only we can bestow
 This is the price you pay for loss of control
 This is the break in the ground
 This is the closest of calls
 This is the reason you're alone, this is the reason you fall!
 
 We're consentratin' on fallin' apart
 We were contenders, now throwin' the fight
 I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe...
 
 We're consentratin' on fallin' apart
 We were contenders, now throwin' the fight
 I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe in us





I always have liked that song. I don't know how much it applies right now but some of it has for awhile. I'm very confused. I don't want to push and prod when it's possible that I am the only one who really wants things to work right now. I just spent three years on that kind of crap and I don't plan on doing it again any time soon. It's really too soon for anything serious. It really is. We would ruin any chance we have of being truly happy together. But I don't know if I could be more than a friend if I am put on a back burner for awhile. Do what you need to do but if you ""try again"" I probably will only be able to be your friend. We can never be together if you live with her. I know this now. You are too weak. You'll always give in. Free yourself and we'll see where this could go. If you want. I almost think you don't want to. I'll be honest and say that I am not sure anymore. Not sure that what you say is true, if that's really what you want. If you wanted me, you know you can have me some day. There is a big black cloud hanging over this. I hate not being in control. It's throwing me completely out of my element. I don't like it but strangely enough I am okay with it for now. That should say a lot about me. A lot about how much you mean to me and a lot about how I've grown up. I don't know if it's enough though. I hate not knowing. But I'm dealing with that too. Bah. I'm just going to focus on me and hopefully everything else will fall into place like it should. I hope you don't let me go this time. You let me go too easily last time... not to say I don't blame you. 

Please don't give up so easily this time. I can't wait forever.

I kind of really care about you a lot. Sorry if that scares you."

I took Jeremy to the airport yesterday. I guess I'm still in shock from it all. I'm really proud of him, I'm happy for his new job. I just don't know why it has to be so far away! I trust him though, which is amazing for me to admit... I mean, I remember the LAST time a significant other took off on an airplane... but w/e it was coming anyway.

He is happy with this. I guess he drove an 80 thousand dollar car today. I would be afraid to even TOUCH it, let alone drive it! 

He's going to be making a lot of money and going to be able to spend a lot of time learning the things he is really interested in. I'm happy about that, really I am. 

He comes back April 17th to get his things in order at the house (his employer is paying for the rent until the end of the lease... that's how much they wanted him down there NOW) and a going-away bash... then he's heading back. And he'll be gone until like June or something. Melissa's graduation. And she and I are getting an apartment that month. Hopefully she saves up money before then so we can just get it at the beginning of the month and she'll have a place to have a few friends for graduation night. Who knows. Jeremy will stay with us every three months or so when he comes back to visit. 

This is a good time for this either way; I just started my third quarter at school. I am taking three classes (16 credits) and will be VERY busy with things. blah.

one way or another i'm missing him a lot. 

i can't wait until the 17th."

it was pretty good. i guess showtime has a series on the Tudors. Crystal is going to bring down season 1 this week and we are going to watch it.

it's spring break. woot. doing nothing though. :P

we went to long beach this weekend. it was very fun. we made a sandcastle. and got lost with our beach wagon... long story. :P

the cabin/cottagething was really nice. they even gave us chocolate marshmallow eggs on easter morning. oh yeah, we didn't know it was easter until after making the reservations. :P

we spent a lot of time in the local arcade. we think the guy didn't like jeremy very much. he won like 30 things out of the crane machines... the guy actually had to refill it while we were there. bah hahaha.

we ate a lot of food.

I read a little of what I wrote a superlongtimeago... damn... i was a mean bitch to some folk. 

Other than that I was just PATHETIC.

blah. 

I think I was more interesting then I am now... but still kind of pathetic. Kind of oozy. 

Update: FINALLY in college. going to be a doctor. I realize that before I had a lack of drive to do anything beyond something simple. I mean, I was planning on just being a nurse. LAME. Just because the schooling was so short. I love college so much more than stupid public school. I never had anyone push me beyond what's easy. I'm glad to get away from the people I was around all the time. What will they amount to in life? Not much as I've seen. damn drug addicted fools. 

those of you who always kept me sane (my online buddies)... Thanks.

I'm kind of disappointed in myself for working after high school instead of going to school, but at the same time I don't think I'd appreciate it as much. I see these kids that start college right after high school and they skip class and goof off like it's still high school. losers. their future depends on this, but they don't seem to care. 

I'm still with Jeremy (before known as Kainoa)... it'll be three years in July. I live with my dad right now, Melissa and I are going to get an apartment in June. It will be loads of fun. We will have bunnies and kittens!!! Anyway, I work two part time jobs for fun... Party City and City Soups. Kind of random. City Soups is a lot of fun. Sometimes I work in the store but mostly I do other things. I will be quitting Party City soon and looking for a waitressing job for Thursday-Saturday nights. woot. 

I actually need to be studying for my Math final which is tonight...

so peace."

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

Drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
Cause you channel all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You shouldn't ever come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
And I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand
Go fix yourself

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself

Actually, on my test, everyone is. The above score breaks down <font color=""blue""><b>what kind of thinking you most enjoy</b></font>
doing. A score above 100% means you use that kind of thinking more than
average, and a score below 100% means you use it less. It says nothing
about how good you are at any one, just how <i>interested</i> you are in each, relatively. A substantial difference in scores between two people means, conclusively, that they are <font color=""#006600"">different kinds</font> of thinkers.

<b>Matching Summary:</b> Each of us has different tastes.  Still, I offer the following advice,  which I think is obvious:<br><br>
<ol><li>Don't date someone if your <font color=""#ff0066"">interpersonal percentages</font> differ by more than <font color=""#ff0066"">80%</font>.

So i am not thinking anymore that it came from my account like at all. seriously. it couldn't have at all. but i'm pissed. and if any of you reading this KNOW what i am talking about (other than one exception) then whatever. if i EVER fucking find out who did it... first i'm going to MAKE them tell me how they did. like torture and whatnot. and then after that they will probably eat their own reproductive organs. male OR female. I don't give a fuck. i'm pissed. and i'll be pissed. i fucking hate that someone is such a douche. i was happy enough. 

on another note. i went to emerald ridge today. i spent last nite at amy's and went out to buttfuck washington (orting) to see her bf play in the high school band. LOL... funniest damn thing i've seen this week. and then today i saw some friends that i haven't seen in several years. and i got some hugs. and some other things that i'm excited about. my friend is gunna call me so we can hang out sometime. yay. he used to be my neighbor when i lived on south hill. but he and this other guy and i used to be really good friends and we hung out a lot. hell we all lived by each other. so we'll have to hang out again. it'll be grand. anyways. i'm done with THIS shit. i'm out fuckers. (well the only ppl that are fuckers are those who try to fuck me over... like those who send emails out... haa bitches.)"

"event","okay well i'm copying bailee but for different reasons then hers. i'm going to make my posts ""friends only"" for computer security reasons. i don't know how to erase history on AOL and i really don't think i want my mother or sister getting into/reading my posts that are for my friends. so if you are a friend and want to read my posts or just someone who wants to read my posts then just leave a message and i will take care of that quickly!! thanks!

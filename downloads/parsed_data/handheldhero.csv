Y'know, I was sitting and kind of regretting that I up and left this journal like I did.  Well, not really regretting, but not informing anyone of where I was going.  For those who care at least.

Anyway, my new journal is at greatestjournal.com, under the same username (handheldhero).  It's not a friends only or anything, but that wouldn't matter because I doubt anybody reads this.

So yeah, if you're bored or you even check this, check out my other journal.  Or, if you want to go way back in time, you could check the diaryland.com journal I started back in September.  Good times...

Oh yeah, that's under handheldhero too.

Well, until later days everyone.  Adieu.

Today was bland.  Overly bland.  I woke up to my mom and brother poking me and goading me to go to Coco's for breakfast.  We did that, then I took Evan to Nickel-Nickel and played stuff with him for a while.  Went to Marshall's where I bought a much-needed wallet.  I have a wallet now.  A bill-fold wallet.  It's wallety =p.

After that we walked home (our car is broken by the way, our 10-year old car finally sploded) and hung out.  We had dinner, and the Grammys came on.  And The White Stripes played.  And Jack White shredded.  And it was glorious.  Later the Foo Fighters played with a jazz pianist.  And it was glorious too.  But Jack White is the greatest.

Yeah, it was cool.  And I'm playing with my wallet... it's flipping and flapping and I had all four of the Starbuck's frappucinos we had.  I'm ancy.  And jittery.  And bouncy.  Bouncy.... squee!

Okay.

Done, right-o?

"event","Y'know, I had a really good day today.  I woke up and took a shower, then Jeremy called.  We went to that X-Box connecty thing that his friends were throwing, that was fun for the while.  Him and Josh are a whole lot of fun to hang out with (Josh is his brother).  After our day, he came back to my house because I had to watch my brother.  Evan chilled out and played video games (mind you it's about 9 or 10 ish) so me and Jeremy went outside and shot the breeze.  We talked about everything... past, present, future, where we're going with our lives.  And I realized that he is like a really through and through true friend.  So now I'm in this indecision... I mean, everything is going swell for me in Whittier.  I'm comfortable, my grades are fine, I have friends and people that like me... everything seems too good to be true.  But at the same time... I'm not that happy.  I find that when me and Jeremy and Cody hang out and talk, I'm really content.  When we stay up late playing video games and such, it's the times I treasure the most.  Sadly enough to say... I think that after high school, they're going to be my lifelong friends.  

I decided not to clue Chris in on this journal.  This is a place where I can write what I'm feeling, without having to be careful about what I say.  So anyway, the reason I'm angry is cause this day was going great, right?  So I'm totally thinking that him and I will do something tonight, then tomorrow night stay over at Cody's jammin' and writing songs.  And it'll be the greatest time ever, cause it'll be with my friends.  They're the people I can relate with... they have issues, and they're not ideal, they're not overachievers.  Chris and Cam and the rest of them are all so distant from me.  They're my friends too, but for some reason I can't talk to them like I can to Jeremy.  Anywho, I'm thinking tomorrow's going to kick all kinds of ass, then my mom goes ""hey, I'm working the night shift tomorrow, you can't do anything!  You have to watch your brother!""

How aggravating.  How utterly, how intensely aggravating.  She ruined my plans man.  I was so mad... I still am very angry.  Now I'm listening to Death Cab to counteract the mood.  Maybe the sad will contend with the mad and create a nonchalant.  Maybe.

I guess it's that time to be going now.  I don't really find any reason to be on the computer at the moment.  There's not any more to tell either =\.  I'm gonna go and be emo now.

P.S. (I don't really know how to make or get icons... I'll try to figure it out though.)

Hi there livejournal.  I'm Kasim, or Kaz, and well, this is my first entry here.  I was at diaryland until I learned that all the cool kids use livejournal.com.  Well not really, it just had more features to it.  Or at least it will when I learn HTML.  So uh... yeah.  I play bass and sing.  Or at least I hope to when we start our band, Elsworth.  Non-existent yet but it'll rise.

I don't know how long these usually are... my diaryland ones were usually rather long.

So, ta-ta for now

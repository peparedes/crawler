"event","Today seemed rather short. Woke up in the morning then just went to class to take my final. The teacher had grapes there lol. I love grapes they are yummy. There was this super annoying girl in our class and she had to freaking sit next to me. I dont know how people can stand it. Anyways I took the test and then I was done. Went home and called my gf. She didnt pick up but called me back. We talked for a bit then I went to take a nap and she went too. I think she went first idk. Is it important really. Woke up and just talked to her. Didnt really do anything else. It was a pretty boring day I guess but I enjoy talking to my gf. She is the best :D. So thats all for today."

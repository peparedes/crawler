What used to be my regular routine now slaughters me halfway through. It is Friday, and I am feeling the worst of it. My chest and arms are so sore and my movements without pain are little to none.

Long story short, I must be consistent to maintain any hopes of ever being fit.

I also hiked south mountain, and felt like throwing up the entire time.

Lily's getting fixed today. Poor girl. I'm tagging along with mom just to say I did something today. Gots to get Sean something too, it's his birthday today.

I did not get to rest at the beach house, as soon as I got there I put my stuff on the ground and then went to LA with bob and bethany. I was dissapointed with shopping, until we got to the second Undefeated, where I bought some Nikes. Thai food was different and equally tasty, thanks Bethany. Santa Monica the next day, we got ripped off at the Weinersnitzel (spell check) and kept searching for a non existen kid robot. The beach house was equally divided between food and the office.
Cattle Decapitation was great, The Faceless not as good as the first time I saw them but still good. Silly 2 step band wasn't that bad.
Pink's makes really good hot dogs, and I could walk around workmen's for hours. Especially when they play a mixtape of The Notorious BIG.

How do I solve this unsolvable dilemma?""

There are two answers, of course.  The first is to just put your new files in a different directory.  But a much more <b>fun</b> solution is to utilize a union filesystem like UnionFS!  If properly implemented, you will be able to save new files to the same directory, and see all the old ones with it, but the new files will <i>actually</i> be saved in a different folder.  On October 26, you can back up the new directory, knowing that all the files you already backed up have not changed.  And you'll still have time to throw a party!"

<hr>
Today has been good so far, but if I don't start doing my mounds of homework it will start to go bad.  I have 2 math assignments, biology, history, studying for a quiz in gym, and research for something that was really over Thursday.

A recent and currently ongoing issue: My brother is getting a dog!  I don't want a dog.  He just turned... (oh what a good brother I am) 12?  Anyway, he's wanted a dog for years, but I don't want one and neither do my parents.  They finally gave in, on the condition that HE has to take care of it, unlike all the smaller compensation pets he's neglected (cat, snake, rat, fish, newt... not in that order).  Oh well.  I'll see what happens I guess.

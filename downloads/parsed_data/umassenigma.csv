"event","I am in my new apartment and I even have furniture!  Exciting, no? I have to say, I absolutely LOVE my new apartment.  It's clean, bright, and, although it's smaller than my old apartment, I feel like it's arranged better, because I have a more separate (though small) dining room.  Also, I just learned that the sofa that I was able to get is a sofa bed (so, for those of you who didn't want to visit before because I lived in a Residence Hall, never fear!).  But, looking around, I will need to get more furniture.  I'm in need of some more bookshelves and dresser-type items, but that'll happen in due course.  I am rather proud of putting together the two 6 and a half feet bookshelves that are currently housing my DVD collection and books.  
Well, time to go.  I've got to get ready for my tour this evening and finish making my new bed!
Housewarming party details coming soon!"

"event","Good and fun news everyone!  I am once again gainfully employed... with a vacation!
As many of you know, I began to really hate where I was working due to a number of factors.  Well, i resigned a number of months ago to end at the end of May, but they asked me to stay a few extra days, which I was fine with... it extended my health insurance.  So, all in all, my last job finished on Monday.  Well, I've been job searching for quite awhile and it all paid off, I finally got offered a position for the job of my dreams yesterday at a college that still near philadelphia, but out of the city (it's much more near plymouth meeting than philadelphia, really).  The woman I'm going to work for is fantastic and I'll be living on campus but not in campus... this means that I'm living in an apartment that they're providing for me in the apartment complex across the street.... not in a residence hall!!!! Maybe now I can have a puppy!  (I can dream... right?)
Anyway, the job doesn't start until July 1, so I actually have some time off to go and rest, relax, and maybe even travel and see my friends.  So, if you want to see me let me know and I'll see what I can do!
Yay for employment!"

"event","Ok, so, as you know, Gloria's asked me to put in any recipes that I like here, so that you all can try them.  Here's one that I just made up tonight, using very few ingredients and it's extremely easy to make.  Here goes, it serves 3, but you can always double, triple, etc:

1 sheet of Puff Pastry (I use the Peppridge Farm kind), thawed
3 chicken breasts, skinned and cleaned
1/2 cup of milk (don't use skim, but I used 1% and that's fine, if you wanted to, you could use whole or cream if you wanted to - I'm trying to keep the fat down)
Small pat of butter (like 1-2 teaspoons)
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/8 cup of warm water
2 TBS of flour or cornstarch (I like flour better, personally, but they're both thickening agents, so whichever you have)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil.
Roll out the puff pastry until it's a third bigger than it originally is.
Heat the milk slowly in a saucepan over medium heat.
Mix the warm water and 2TBS of flour or cornstarch and, once the milk is boiling, pour into the milk.  
Add the thyme, as well as a pinch of salt and ground pepper, into the milk and allow to thicken.  Once it has thickened, take it off the heat and put aside.  
Cut the puff pastry into 3 equal strips.
Dip a piece of chicken into the milk mixture, shake to remove excess, and place onto a strip of pastry.
Roll the pastry around the chicken and place, seam side down, on the baking sheet.  Repeat 2 more times.
Place in the oven, on the middle rack, for 20 minutes.  
After 20 minutes, take them out and serve immediately.

They're really easy, and SO good.  If you have pastry left over, you can do the following:
Roll out the sheet and cut into 6 squares.
Take a little softened butter and dab around the edges of each side of the square.
Put in about 2-3TBS of chocolate chips on half of the square.
Fold over the other side and crimp shut using a fork.
Cut a slit or 2 on the top.
Place in the 400 degree oven you used above, on the same rack, on an aluminum foil covered baking sheet.
Cook for 15 minutes, until lightly golden brown.  
Cool for 5 minutes and serve with a little whipped cream, ice cream, or just on its own.

Enjoy!"

"event","Gloria asked me to put recipes of things that I make up on here (mostly so that she can use them).  Here's the recipe for my chocolate tartlets.  Now, it looks like a lot of work, but it's really not.  All you have to do is make the crust first, then while it's in the fridge do the chocolate filling and cherry sauce.  It's a great tart.  If you wanted to make it extra chocolate-y, when making the crust replace 1/4 cup of the flour with 1/4 cup of cocoa powder.  Just make sure that when you roll everything out you dust with cocoa powder, not with flour.

Pastry Dough - 
1 egg yolk
2 TBS heavy cream
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 c. flour
3/4 c. confectioner's sugar
1/4 tsp salt
10 TBS cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2"" cubes
Mix the first three ingredients together in a small bowl, set aside.  Put the flouf, sugar, and salt into a food processor and do 4 pulses.  Add the butter in and pulse 20 more times.  Pour in the liquids in and process until it comes together - about 12 seconds.  Empty the bowl onto a sheet of saran wrap and press into a small disk.  Refrigerate for about an hour.
Take out of the fridge and put onto a floured counter and roll out.  At this point you can either put it in a large tart pan or cut into rounds and put into small tart pans.  Dock the dough (poke small holes in it with a fork) and place in the freezer for 30 minutes for a large tart, 10 minutes for small tarts.  Butter (or use Pam spray) a piece of aluminum foil and place (buttered side to crust) onto crust, and place either dried beans or pie weights onto the foil.  I use dried lima beans, but you can use anything, as long as they have some weight to them.  Put the shell (shells) into a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes for a large tart, 8 for tartlets.  Take off foil and pie weights and continue to bake another 5-10 minutes, until lightly golden brown.

Chocolate Filling
12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped or processed finely put into a bowl
1 c. heavy cream
6 TBS unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 TBS Cognac or Vanilla extract
1 tsp espresso powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Heat the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium, medium-high heat (make sure it doesn't boil!).  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for about a minute.  Slowly whisk the chocolate and milk together until smooth (don't whip it, you don't want to make it aerated).  Slowly stir in the butter a tablespoon at a time.  Mix in the last three ingredients and set aside and let it cool to room temperature (do NOT put it in the fridge).  Once the mixture's cooled pour into the cooled tart shell and refrigerate until firm (about 1 hour)

Cherry Sauce
1 bag Trader Joe's Dark Sweet Cherries
1/3 c. sugar
1/2 c. water
1 TBS Lemon Juice
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Put the first three ingredients into a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Let it boil for about 5 minutes over medium-high heat.  Put the sauce into a blender, puree, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer.  Put the liquid back into the saucepan and let it boil again for about 3-5 minutes, until it's reduced some.  Add in the lemon juice and cinnamon.  

To plate: 
Put one tart onto a plate (if you make these a day or so ahead (don't make them more than 48 hours ahead though), make sure you take them out of the fridge a few hours before you plan on serving them so they get to room temperature) and drizzle the cherry sauce over the tart.  Top with a little sweetened whipped cream and a sprig of mint.
Enjoy!"

"event","So my step-brother got married yesterday, so congratulations to him.  I really do like his new wife, Laura, and she was a beautiful bride.  We had the rehearsal dinner on Friday night, and I guess I surprised some of my family.  I do look a little different than I did about, oh, 10 years ago.  But, you know, what's 10 years?  
Darren actually came with me Friday night (no, I didn't have to twist his arm and torture him - surprisingly enough).  Of course, he almost gave me a heart attack on Friday when I IM-ed him with ""5:45"" (as in, the time we had discussed of me getting down there to meet him) and he said, ""I thought it was 6:30"".  6:30 was when we were supposed to be there, but he pulled it together and was surprisingly gentlemanly, helping me in and out of my coat, pulling out my chair, getting me wine, standing close to me during cocktail hour.  More than anything he was probably nervous - he's never been to the restaurant we were at, it's a bit fancier than I think he's been to (not to sounds snobby - but it's true), and he was around people he's never met before.  But it was nice.  
Of course yesterday Marie (my step-mother) was doing the ""two down, one to go!"" (Both my step-brothers are now married - I'm the last one)  They have quite some time before I get married.  Of course, I kinda have to get a boyfriend first.... hmmm... so many steps.
Oh, and I got hit on by a married man last night at Carlo's wedding.  He kept alternating between calling me the ""hot sister"" and ""nikki cox"".  I don't actually know who nikki cox is (I ended up googling her when I got back home - I don't look anything like her), but it was just very creepy.  And his wife was there!  Not at the table with us, but she was with him at the wedding.  Just because he was plastered doesn't mean it's ok.  Oh, and he has two daughters.  My Dad was appalled when this guy called him over and started talking.  Just my luck!  However, I did keep my step-sister-in-law, Danielle, entertained.  I started playing psychologist to the drunk guy and Danielle and I had a great laugh.  Note to married men: Don't hit on girls who are almost 10 years younger than you when you have a wife and two children.  And before you think I'm jumping to conclusions about this guy, he wasn't just complimentary, he was inappropriate, looking at my chest, making other comments that I think his wife would be upset to hear.  Danny and Danielle both agreed that it was completely inappropriate.  
Anyway, it was amusing, to say the least.  But Carlos and Laura had a beautiful wedding, both of them looked great, and I'm very happy for them.
I guess that's it.  I still hate my job, I'm looking for a new one in Student Activities and Event Planning/Management.  Don't get me wrong, I still love ResLife, and if I could find a position that incorporates both, I'd be a happy camper.  I don't mind being on call, I just hate having to deal with a building that's falling down, and the angry parents that come with it.  And now with Josh leaving at the beginning of March, I don't really know what to expect.  I tend to be the scapegoat of the group - or, at least, that's how my boss makes me feel.
Anyway, I guess that's it for me.  Busy week coming up, I've got a meeting Tuesday night, a staff meeting on Wednesday night, and Darren on Thursday night (he's making dinner for me!  It's about time!  Let's hope I survive - D's ideal dinner is one that he doesn't have to cook.  If I don't make it, ya'll can just divide things up amongst yourselves).
Later!"

"event","Try not to pass out... I'm actually updating this thing....
Let's see.... I hate my job, I hate my boss (which, right now, the feeling is mutual), and am looking for a new job.  Right now, I don't care who takes me - I'll go back to baristing (I don't know if that's even a word) until I find a Student Activies job.  Or maybe, just maybe, I should be a bartender, because god knows that's what I spent and hour to an hour and a half doing tonight.  I'm not talking about being with my best friend and us talking about the things that are bothering us.  I'm talking about straight-up counseling.  Of course, I got picked out by this poor (and by that I mean he was a bit pathetic) guy whose fiancee broke up with him (2 YEARS AGO).  On the upside, he bought our drinks for us, on the downside I had to turn him down to come back after I dropped my best friend, Cyn, back at her car after he literally poured his heart out to me.  Geez.  He was a sweet guy but I wasn't attracted to him, and he was too broken for me.  He gave up his friends for his girlfriend-turned-fiancee because she gave him this guilt trip of ""why are you hanging out with your friends?  don't you want to hang out with me?"".  In a lot of ways, how you treat your friends once you're in a long-term (he was with her for 7 years) relationship says a lot about you.  For all those of you who have ever been ditched by a friend for a boyfriend/girlfriend give me a ""hell yeah.""  I'll admit that I've probably slipped every so often, but your friends are the ones that are always there - sometimes in the background, sometimes in the front, but they should always be valued as there.  Once you loose them it is very hard to get them back.
What's my point in all of this?  Who knows?  At this point I've drunk to forget.  And the nagging voices have finally quieted down, so now it's to sleep for me.
So, as I sign off I have a toast - to my friends.  To the one's who've stuck by me and the ones have listened.  I appreciate you.  Probably more than you know, probably more than I've let on.  Thank you."

"event","Right, so it's 1AMish (not to be confused with Amish) on the day after my birthday.  
Just a few things about today.  It sucked.  Hardcore.
I was alright with the face that I had to work (we re-opened the halls today), and was even cool with things going wrong this afternoon while we were closing.  It was alright, I understood that.  It's my job.  It's all good.
But then it went downhill.  I was not on call this week, and yet on Monday and Tuesday got repeatedly called at all hours to respond to events.  I can't pass it over when I get called because my boss has told me that I'm not supposed to do that.  (More about his confusing supervision skills later) So I was willing to do that for the beginning of the week.  But today.  I wasn't on call.  Josh could have handled the situation.  Had he been called, he would have done a superb job at it, I know that.  But they didn't call him.  They called me.  And since I can't pass it over, I had to handle the situation.  Fine.  That's my job, right?  Except that everyone who I called to respond avoided handling the situation.  Isn't that great?  
So.  Instead of having a nice, relaxing birthday that required a little bit of work, I ended up just as stressed out as I was before vacation and completely upset over the fact that on the one day that I asked to be relatively off, I couldn't have it.  
On the upside, I've put up and decorated my christmas tree.
That's enough bitching, I think I'm finally ready to go to bed.  Night."

Your birth on the 27th day of the month (9 energy) adds a tone of selflessness and humanitarianism to your life path. 
Certainly, you are one who can work very well with people, but at the same time you need a good bit of time to be by yourself to rest and meditate. 
There is a very humanistic and philanthropic approach in most of things that you do. 

This birthday helps you be broadminded, tolerant, generous and very cooperative. 
You are the type of person who uses persuasion rather than force to achieve your ends.
You tend to be very sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and you able to give much in the way of friendship without expecting a lot in return.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

I haven't really had any time off, between being on duty and ghost tours and having to respond to things even when I'm not on duty and shouldn't have to.  My boss is sending me all of these conflicting messages like ""I don't want you to answer your cell phone when you're not on call but you'd better answer it in case the campus is burning down,"" or ""You shouldn't respond to incidents when you're not on call, but you shouldn't pass them over to someone else when you get called and you're not on call.""  ::twitch twitch::
And on other fronts, numbnuts (as we shall henceforth call the boy until he's upgraded to rat bastard status) has completely ruined any chance he ever had with me.  Just the things that he's done in the last 48 hours make my head hurt - they belong in a Lewis Black routine.
So, here I am, eating styrofoam that's packaged as potato chips because I desparately crave the salt and drinking diet coke because I was called at 4AM for an incident at the building down the street, then again at 7AM because of the Desk.

Believe you me, if I get called tonight in the middle of the night whoever it is I have to see (especially since I KNOW I'm going to have to go down to Goodman) is going to get lectures 1, 5, and 8, on top of whatever they've done.

"event","Right.  So I'm sure everyone can agree with me when I say that I'm completely stressed out right about now.  Work's crazy, what with July now almost over and RA Training and Opening coming up in less than a month.  I haven't really taken a vacation, if for no other reason than because everyone else keeps taking vacation and someone has to be on campus.  Next year I'll learn.
But that's not all of it.  So I planned to go down to the beach (a place I haven't visited in almost 6 years) with my mom and grandparents for the weekend.  Was going to go down tomorrow and come back on Sunday morning after spending the night at my mom's Saturday night.  I didn't really want to go to the beach, but it's for my family, and I'm willing to suck it up for them.  But things come up.  My friend Anthony is moving to NY on Monday and a few of my other friends are throwing him a party Saturday night.  In all honesty, it wouldn't infringe on my plans at the beach, since the party's late (and who goes to a party when it's supposed to start anyway).  We'd still leave at the same time, and I'd just head straight back to Philly instead of staying over.  To off-set this (and so my mom wouldn't feel like I didn't spend time with her) I took off work tomorrow for the SPECIFIC reason of being able to spend the entire day with her (something I wouldn't have done on Sunday).  I was going to surprise her with this by showing up tonight, but now I'm reconsidering. 
I can understand why she might be a little disappointed but she's not willing to even compromise.  After I spoke with her she left me a message telling me that if I can't do the original plan then we won't do it at all.  Honestly.  Am I being unreasonable here or does it seem as though she's being just a little childish.  I understand that I'm changing the plan.  I understand that that can be a little bit upsetting.  But this is a friend that I've gotten to know pretty well since I moved to Philly.  Although I know that NY is not that far away, let's be honest here.  He's not going to be back and forth on a regular basis.  It's a common thing where we tell ourselves that we'll talk and visit all the time but we never do.  It's just a lie that helps us ease the anxiety of parting ways.  Realistically, people get busy, and when others are not right in front of them, the effort is often procrastinated.
More than anything, the whole beach ""Either it's all or nothing"" thing just bothers me."

"event","K, so it's been like a year since I've updated this puppy, and I have a few minutes now, so I might as well.  
For those of you who haven't read the archives, I'm a RD at a small University in Philadelphia.  I'm coming up on my 1-year anniversary, and getting ready to start grad school in the fall.  I've definately learned a lot in the past 11 months, and I'm so glad I took the position.  
I had a boyfriend at one point, but that fizzled.  I've been on a few dates, but none of the can keep up with me, especially given how my job can be.  I love it, others don't.  
I had sinus surgery in May.  It was not fun, but it's 7 weeks and counting for not having a sinus infection... so that's pretty nice.  (And no, my nose looks exactly the same as before - not everyone gets a nose job too).  
I'm going to be a bridesmaid in Oct 2006 (YAY GLO!) along with KIMMY!  (Hopefully I'll have someone to bring!)
And, yeah.  That's really it.  The days are long sometimes but I have the greatest co-workers and superiors ever.  They're all gay, so I'm the token (female and straight - they get a two for one!)
Anyway, that's it for now.  I promise I'll try to get into the habit of writing in this again.  You know me, I'm so bad at keeping up with this.  
Shout outs to anyone in Massachusetts, especially the NSPers!
Later!"

"event","Ok.  So I actually feel guilty.  I was on the phone with Jason last night when I got a knock at my apartment door.  Figuring it was just one of my RA's coming to ask me a question, I kept him on the phone and went to answer the door.  Turns out it was a bigger crisis and I had to get off the phone.  Unfortunately, he hasn't been around long enough to know that when I say, ""I have to go, NOW,"" I mean NOW, and not two minutes from now.  So I was short with him on the phone and basically hung up.  And now I feel guilty.  He doesn't understand what it's like for me when I'm on call.  He doesn't understand that the situation I had to deal with was part of a bigger situation (well, he sort of does, but he doesn't know the seriousness of it).  I know this all sounds very dramatic, and, in some ways, the situation was.  
But now, how do I get rid of this guilt?  Will it go away once I explain to him that when I'm on call, now means NOW.  I signed up for this job willingly, and I don't regret a second of it (well, except for tequila night, I still sometimes regret tequila night - and by that I mean having to take a kid to the hospital and sit next to him as he empties his stomach contents into a plastic bag because he did 10 shots of tequila).  How can I expect someone out of the field to understand?  Is it fair for me to date someone out of the field, because so much of what I do when I'm on call is emergency response?
I need help."

"event","Guess who went to bed at 10:00 last night?  This girl, right here.  In all actuality, I was in bed at quarter of nine, after proclaiming that I quit for the day.  Almost fell asleep while reading until the boy called at 9:30.  (Luckily he had to be up early too).  Off the phone at 10 and I fell asleep almost instantly.  Why does this matter?  Because at 7:30, when I normally get up, I couldn't do it.  Even at 8AM when I forced myself to get up it was a struggle.  I can't wait for this weekend... I don't have to work (well, I am on call, but that's not a big deal), which means I don't have to get up early.  Yay sleep.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention...  Looks like yours truly's going to need surgery after all.  That should be tons of fun... I've been avoiding setting a date to it... Mostly because the risk scare the hell out of me (CSF leak, blindness, death, for example).  That, and it'll take me literally 5 days to recover.  (Oh, and if anyone can remember if I broke my nose with at any point, please let me know... both my parents and I are baffled... deviated septum my ass... if I hadn't seen it on the CT I wouldn't have believed them).

I still feel as crappy as I did in November (though, I'm glad I don't feel as bad as I did in December - that was rough).  What's worse is that they don't have an explanation for me.  They think it's because I moved back down to Philly, they think it's because I'm living in/near a big city, they think it's because I broke my nose when I was younger (though, I don't remember this happening).  They think a lot of things, they just don't know.  
I know it's that not big of a deal.  It could be worse.  A lot worse.  
I guess there's no sense in worrying until I hear what they have to say.  I'm just hopeful that surgery won't have to happen.  I hate that mess.
Sorry to be such a downer, but I remind you of my above equation.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.  I want my energy back.  I want to not to have to end the day at 9PM absolutely exhausted because I put so much into my work. There's a lot of things that I want, but I'm not sure how to get it back."

I know I haven't written much (except that really whine-y post a week or so ago).  Oh well.  
I've got about 2 weeks left before I find out if I need surgery or not (so Kimmy, I feel your pain!).  These last few weeks are going to be hard enough with work, but the fact that I'm not getting any better (or at least, than I can tell) and that my ENT is a little nervous about the whole situation makes me a little anxious.  
My wrist is finally starting to feel better, thank goodness.  When I fell on it, I seriously thought I had broken it.  It definately prompted me to get a work study student (and I'm very glad that she's a good worker), and I can now do other stuff instead.  
Of course, I'm now going to become so spoiled I'll forget how to type.
I hope everyone's doing well and ya'll are ready for the superbowl.  Who am I cheering for?  I don't know yet.  I guess we'll see tonight where my loyalties lie.
Enjoy the day and be safe!

"event","What should have been a good end to a bad week went horribly, horribly wrong.
For those of you who don't know, let me give you an update.
I have literally been sick for 3 months now, starting on Nov 22, when I was first diagnosed with a sinus infection.  On Christmas Day I was in an emergency center with another one.  A week and a half ago I was diagnosed with another one.  Baffled, my allergist gave me 3 weeks of Amoxicilin and sent me for a CT scan and an ENT appointment.  I had that done this week.  The CT was fine, the ENT appointment, on the other hand, was not.  I won't give you the details, but needless to say, the ENT was speechless.  SO, not only am I on Amoxicilin, they put me on a very high dose of Predisone.  My doctor's comment on the high dose?  ""This dose will make you crazy,"" to which I replied, ""What exactly do you mean, crazy?""  ""Well, let's just say you shouldn't make any life-changing decisions for the next week or so.""  I'm only on day 2, so I'm waiting for the crazy to set in.  But in about 2 weeks I have to go in for another CT scan and ENT appointment.  If it hasn't cleared up, guess who's looking at surgery?
But I was willing to brush it off.  I mean, there was nothing I could do about it, so I focused on the weekend.  I was supposed to go ice skating at the river rink at Penn's Landing and then go over to Dave & Buster's for dinner and games with a friend of mine.  Except, I fell.  Now, I laughed when I fell.  I mean, it was humorous.  However, what happened during the fall was not.  As I fell I put my hands out to break my fall, and landed on my left wrist.  Hard.  I shook it off, and kept on skating.  By the time we were ready to leave I was in pain. No swelling, just sharp, unrelenting pain.  So I skipped D&B's and went home.  Putting on an imobilizing brace didn't help at all, so it was off to the ER.  I was there for 4 and a half hours before being called in.  (Luckily my dad came up so I had company).  They took a bunch of X-rays (which was, by the way a painful process), told me I'd seriously damaged it, but that it wasn't broken.  Now, here's the funny part.  The doctor came over with instructions and to release me and told me that I could take 600 mg's of Ibuprofen to manage the pain.  I actually laughed at her and said, ""Are you kidding?  I've got 800 mg's of it waiting for me at home, thanks though.""  She looked at me funny, and I said one word that said it all, ""Migraines.""  She smiled, laughed and told me to go home.  
So I did.  And ate the first meal of the day.  And ent to bed.  Did I sleep?  Not really... Everytime I moved I woke up with pain shooting through my wrist and arm.  And it sucks.
Sorry for the bitch session, I just haven't really let this stuff out.  
Anyway, that's my complaining for the day.  I'm going to end this now, since I'm only typing with 1 hand."

"event","It's amazing to me, when I reflect on this past year, how things have flown by.  I know we're not to New Year's yet, we've still got a few more days, but I've always done these things early so why break the tradition?  Here goes...
When you have a free moment, take a look back and see what you've accomplished this year.  Remember the little things with joy, the people you met along the way who you might never see again, and memories that you made with your friends and loved ones.  Look at where you are now, and remember, joyfully, where you used to be.  Don't create a ""those were the days"" situation, but remember the things you used to do, the people you used to know.  
Remember who you used to be, and the steps you took to become who you are now.  Guaranteed that you're not the same person; even if you've only changed a little, you're still not the same person.
Let blame, guilt, and anger go as you enter into the new year.  Embrace happiness, love, and remembrance instead.  Happiness for the path you've taken, even if you didn't expect it, love for those around you, even those who are at a distance, and remembrance of the things that you've learned along the way.  
Throughout the stages of the year, remember who you've gained, and who you've lost.  The lovers, the spouses, the friends who've all been added to or taken away from your life.  For those who've been added, remember them at new years, even if you're not with them.  For those who you've lost, whether it be death or distance, remember who they were and the joy, love, and gentility they brought to your life.  
I hope this doesn't come off to preach-y, my mind's a bit muddled from a cold.  If nothing else, I hope you, whoever reads this, remembers that they are loved, missed, and have touched at least one person's life along the way this year.
Happy New Year"

<UL>
<LI>Still love my job at USP.&nbsp; I'm getting the opportunity to train for a position much higher, so I'll have the experience when I leave in a few years.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>I'm officially 23 (I think....I'm not quite sure.... yes, yes I am 23).&nbsp; Went out and partied with some friends (who happen to be co-workers too... I'm so glad I chose this profession)</LI>
<LI>My apartment is almost done, decorating-wise, so bring on the guests!</LI>
<LI>Cyn's coming back up for New Year's... I've missed my best friend.</LI>
<LI>I've been invited to two NYE parties this year... I think I'll go to the one at Ross's though, since he lives next door.</LI>
<LI>My boss takes us (his staff) out for drinks... that's pretty cool, I think.</LI>
<LI>Looking around at the students right now, I'm very glad I don't have to take finals.</LI>
<LI>My cell phone was lost, so I got a new one (by the way, if I at one point had your number, I don't now because I was stupidly optimistic that I would never lose my phone... so I never backed up my numbers.&nbsp; So, if you'd ever like me to call you, give ME a call and I'll store your number.)</LI></UL>
<P>I think that's probably it... Not much has been happening here lately, it's just busy busy.&nbsp; It's closing now (we close the halls on Saturday), so although I won't be on vacation, we'll be partying!&nbsp; And for those of you who know me, you'll be very proud to hear that I'm actually going to clubs (ok, so I go and play bingo... but hey, it's a first step)... mostly due to the pushy people around me (though, I love 'em).</P>
<P>That's it for now.&nbsp; I hope everyone has a very happy holiday season!&nbsp; Remember not to drink and drive!</P>"

"event","<P>Ok, so it's been about a week and a half since NSP ended.&nbsp; Hard to imagine that that part of my life is completely over.&nbsp; As I've talked to a few people back in MA, I realize that I'm not going back in a few weeks.&nbsp; I have to say, that makes me kinda sad.&nbsp; I'm starting to miss the routine.&nbsp; As I do all of these RD interviews I'm realizing that I don't really want to give up what I've been able to call my life.&nbsp; It's going to be weird to not think about presentations for training.&nbsp; Or the fact that I have to unpack and rearrange my room (a single space) in the matter of an evening.&nbsp; It's just....weird.</P>
<P>For those of you following my job hunt, I'll give you the latest update.&nbsp; Here goes:<BR>Went to West Virginia about a week ago, they offered the position to me on the spot at the end of the day.&nbsp; They went through the entire package, as well as my responsibilities.&nbsp; I told them I'd let them know ASAP (since they needed someone to move in August 1).&nbsp; The pros?&nbsp; It's not in a huge city, which is nice.&nbsp; The apartment was more like a house (it's 2 stories, 4 bedrooms, 1 1/2 bath).&nbsp; The people seemed genuinely pleased to talk with me.&nbsp; The cons?&nbsp; It's out in the boondocks (it's just as far away from home as MA was).&nbsp; The apartment was not furnished...at all.&nbsp; The students that I talked to seemed really jaded when it comes to ResLife.&nbsp; And they make more than RA's at UMass do (even though they have to pay for their single).&nbsp; The pay absolutely SUCKED.&nbsp; So, I kindly and politely told them I couldn't accept the position.&nbsp; Which leaves me with nada right now.&nbsp; So, I've been doing the interviewing thing.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Talked to University of the Sciences (in Philly) on Monday, and about an hour after I got off the phone with them they asked me to come to campus.&nbsp; Talked to Five Towns College (it's on the Island - AKA Long Island), and they have a pretty sweet deal.&nbsp; Really like them, hope they call me back.&nbsp; Talking to University of the Arts in Philly tomorrow at 11:30.&nbsp; Hopefully that'll go well too (it's apparently in a really nice section of Philly - but that apartment's not furnished).&nbsp; </P>
<P>About the apartments and the furnishings.&nbsp; I'd prefer if I could get a furnished apartment only because I don't really have the furniture for it.&nbsp; However, I don't mind furnishing it as long as I only have to furnish 2 rooms or so.&nbsp; I have a lot of bedding and all that crap.&nbsp; I've got end tables, TV tables, little pieces.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, I guess that's it for me at this point.&nbsp; Sorry about not updating too much.&nbsp; I'll try to do better at that, since I know ya'll will want to know where I end up (hopefully I'll end up SOMEWHERE and out of my house).</P>

"event","<P>Right. So.&nbsp; NSP ended a few days ago (read: Wednesday), and I have yet to write about it.&nbsp; Which is pretty much consistent with the rest of the summer.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; I suck at this.</P>
<P>But, before I get into the things I've been up to, 3 good things (including 1 really funny thing) happened on the drive home on Thursday.&nbsp; 3 colleges called to set up phone interviews.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; Now, here's the funny part.&nbsp; As I'm literally 25 minutes away from my house Mount Holyoke calls.&nbsp; They've had my resume for the better part of a month, and they chose the day I <STRONG>leave</STRONG> MA to call me.&nbsp; Although it probably doesn't sound that funny to you, I had a big laugh at it considering that if they want me to do an on-campus, they will have to foot <EM>all</EM> of the expensives <U>up front</U> to get me there.&nbsp; I was 20 minutes away for a month (note: they wouldn't have had to pay for travel expenses, housing, food, etc) after they got my resume, the woman had me on her ""to do list"" to call me for about that long.&nbsp; Wish I could be a fly on the wall for <EM>that</EM> convesation with her boss.&nbsp; This is what I imagine could happen.&nbsp; ""Yeah, so I called Ms. Quinn.&nbsp; She's willing to interview with us.&nbsp; However, if we want to do an on-campus, we'll have to bring her up.""&nbsp; ""Wait a minute (the boss says), didn't she work for UMass this summer?""&nbsp; ""Um... yeah, except she left the day that I called her.&nbsp; And, so, um, yeah.&nbsp; We're going to have to pay for her housing and transportation.""&nbsp; ""Hold on (boss), you mean she was <STRONG>20 minutes away</STRONG> and you didn't call her to come in?""&nbsp; ""Yep, that's about right.""&nbsp; Hee hee.&nbsp; Hopefully she won't be regarded as the village idiot for the next week.</P>
<P>But anyway, onto my NSP entry.&nbsp; It's funny.&nbsp; I was terrified of leaving UMass.&nbsp; I was terrified that once I officially left, with my little safety net gone, I was destined for failure.&nbsp; I was afraid that I would miss it terribly and long to go back.&nbsp; Surprisingly enough (to me at least), that's not true.&nbsp; I loved UMass for the time I was there.&nbsp; However, as I was driving around today to go pick up a pair of shoes for my interview on Monday, I realized just how much I've missed being home.&nbsp; Yes, I miss UMass.&nbsp; I miss most of the people at UMass because they taught me things about me.&nbsp; But I've also missed home and the people here too.&nbsp; I guess, when it comes right down to it, I've missed letting go.&nbsp; I couldn't do that at school.&nbsp; I had to be the responsible one, I had to be the mother because I didn't see anyone else taking the role.&nbsp; I didn't do ""Thank You's"" in the NSP yearbook for one specific reason:&nbsp; The people that I truly cared about (and they know who they are), I hope, know that I appreciated them&nbsp;even though&nbsp;I didn't wait for a pre-ordained moment to give them thanks.&nbsp; Although they've probably forgotten that I existed after I left campus, I'll never forget them for the things that they taught me.</P>
<P>It's funny how sometimes the seemingly strongest people are the weakest inside.</P>"

"event","So, wow.  It's almost the end of NSP.  Let's recap my summer, shall we?
Finding a job at the very last minute.
Graduating.
Darren.
The confirmation that I was right about what happens when you graduate.
Stickdeath.
Marisa's wedding (meeting Rob, having a kick-ass time, not wanting to come back).
Wanting to shove certain people in a closet together just to see who makes it out alive.
Trying to find a real job.
Interviewing. 
Restlessness. 
Staff weekend (which, by the way, no one on the staff seems to really be excited for, which kinda sucks because I definately was and now I'm beginning to feel as though I really don't want to do it).

I know I haven't gone through staff weekend yet, but that's sort of the beginning of the end.  I honestly can't wait to go home.  I miss home.  I miss my best friends.  I miss everything.

Anyway.  Time to go."

"event","Instructions:
On your current playlist, hit shuffle and pick the first twenty songs on the list (no matter how cheesy or embarrassing), and write down your favorite line of the song. Try to avoid putting the song title in the line. Then, have your friends comment and see if they know the songs.

Let's see how much you know.
No googling.

1.  Pack up.  I've strayed.  Enough.  Oh say say say, oh say say say!  Wait, they don't love you like I love you, Wait they don't love you like I love you.
2.  (words I don't understand to begin with) Baby I'm hot just like an oven, I need some lovin'.  Baby I can't hold it much longer, it's getting stronger and stronger.  (more words too fast for me to type).
3.  8 o'clock monday night and i'm waiting, to finally talk a girl a little cooler than me.  Her name's Nona she's a rocker with a nosering she wears a 2way but i'm not quite sure what that means.
4.  We can hang around by the pool.  Did you mom get back from her business trip?  Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip?
5.  Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me?
6.  Goodnight my angel, time to close your eyes, and save these questions for another day.  I think I know what you've been asking me, I think you know what I've been trying to say.
7.  When you wish upon a star, things will take you very far.  when you wake up on a dream, nothing's always what it seems.
8.  The winds of fortune, don't blow the same, she had to get out, and make a change.  She had a kid now, but much too young.  
9.  Hold on to me, love.  You know I can't stay long.  All I wanted to say was I love you and I'm not afraid, Oh.
10. Catch me, as I fall.  Say you're here and it's over now.  Speaking to the utmost fear, no one's here and I fall into myself.  
11. Honey came in and caught me red-handed creepin' with the girl next door.
12. I'm not a perfect person.  There's many things I wish I didn't do.
13. Cutie cutie make sure you move your booty, shake that thing in the city of sin.  
14. Though you make me holler, you make me sweat, I can't get your tenderness.
15. Yeah we like the bomb, baby come and get it on.  
16. Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care.
17. Night, lift up the shades, let in the brillant light of morning.
18. That's where you wanna go, to get away from it all.  Bodies in the sand, tropical drink, melting in your hand.  We'll be falling in love to the sound of a steel drum band.
19. Why don't you come to your senses?  You've been out riding fences, for so long now.
20. Just a' urchin livin' under the street I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
 
Good luck!  (And remember...NO Cheating!!)"

  I understand that it's 2AM, and being thus, it's appropriate to play to the people as they stumble home from the party on the hill... but, could you maybe NOT do it under my window?  Just a thought.
This moment has been brought to you by Tylonel PM.  When you need to block out the sound of a police siren and harmonica symphony, try Tylonel PM."

 I feel like i have really screwed things up between us and i dont know how. We never talk to each other like we used to. Everytime i think that i could possibly lose him makes me want to cry. He is everything to me and i dont wanna lose him for anything in tha world! I kno i sound stupid for sayin that but its true. and even if ppl do say that 14 is to young to fall in love, I swear to god i am on love with him. I just hope he feels tha same way about me."

"event","Noone could understand how shitty i really feel. To have my heart broken and everyone just think i will be ok...well im not gonna be ok. I cant talk to anyone about this and i dont know what to do. I mean i really really like him and everything and i thought he liked me too, but i guess i was wrong. This is the first guy i actually cared for and i ended up gettin my heart broken. How great??!?!?!
I mean i was happy, and i thought everything was cool,i like him,he like me but i guess not. but shit happens.
He should feel real good,hes the first guy i have EVER cried over and cared for.
I loved him and i thought he loved me too. I jusr want everything to be back the way it was. Me and him happy. and not like this. crying over a guy. He said he feels the same way and knows how i feel when none could right now. NOONE!!!! im alone, and noone cares about me. (man i am all emo) 
why did i go and fall inlove??? why why why????? well i guess Breanna's gonna go for him now. and if she does i will kill her. Just because he broke my heart dont mean i cant love him still, cause i do!!!i just wish he felt the same way about me.

+ sorry if i repeated shit +

Well, i guess i gotta get ready to leave. Goin to North Carolina tomorrow morning. 
I still love you."

"event","I think this birthday was the most boringest (word???) birthday i have ever had!!!! We did nothing. I mean i you would think we would go out to eat for it,since we did for paytons,but i guess not. Maybe i they dont like me as much as her. I mean they tell me i have a smartass mouth,and i no i do :) but still. ya know, you think they COULD BE nice..??? but whatever. I wanna go skateboard,but we cant go outside cause the rents arent home and they are OVERPROTECTED! If i was at my house i could go out but nope,not here. Anyways..I am so bored..not shyt to do and never will be. I live a boring life,nothing ever happens in it.and if it does its the saaame shit over and over again. 

I am so happy for Payton. she got to talk to Josh last night and it made her soo happy. I hate it when people get all depressed and shit. Even though i get that was at times also. But still, you know.
   I wanna go do somthing,i hate bein stuck in this house 24-7!It gets boring. Really,it does. If only goin somewhere consist of goin to Wal-Mart i would go!!! but yeah..

I think i am gonna go. Nothing to talk about and i am sure some poeple dont wanna read about my boring as hell life.
BYE BYE

I <3 Nick!"

"event","I dont know why
I just feel really depressed right now.

I guess thinking of everything me and my sister were talking about, people, and random stuff put me in a bad/sad mood. I dont know really. Maybe i am on somthing and dont know what i am talking about. Maybe im not.....never know. I am just ready to go to NC and get away from AL for a while. Get away from everything in this stupid state..this piece of shit town..and just leave.

I have the song "" wake me up when september ends"" in my head. I think that is one of the best songs. Green Day is prolly like my fav. band. 

My sister and I were outside in the freezing cold, pitch black darkness, riding our skateboards. It was fun until it started gettin REALLY REALLy cold.

        I am gonna go do somthing to TRY to make myself undepressed (if thats even a word)

Bye Bye"

  Payton is sad right now and i know exactly how she feels,cause i have been through the same thing before also in my life. Some people never know what its like to hurt soo much. Some people never have people hurt them in there life. And then some people have ALOT of people who hurt them in there lives and its so terrible you juss wanna break down and cry,but dont want everyone to know whats wrong. Its just a fucked up feeling.
    I wanna go somewhere tonight and do somthing. I dont like bein cooped up in one place for a long period of time. I wanna go to the movies,but if we did that i wouldnt be anle to go to t'ville's movies place to see my friends but i dont care! i juss wanna GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!!! this has prolly been the most boring b'day i have ever had. LOL and i think that is quite funniez!!! haha ( i juss said funniez HELP ME)
    I cant wait till saturday, its xmas and i am ready for all the new shit i get! haha.. I asked my dad for drums but i dont think i am gonna get them since he keeps tellin me "" thats alot for someone to ask for"" or some stupid shit like that. But oh well.......BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH *random outburst*
I want some mexican food,ever though i am scared shitless of them.* the people * lol i still like there food. lol.....

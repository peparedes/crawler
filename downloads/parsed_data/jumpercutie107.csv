Fuerst got to come back to the big barn today **excited face** Some crazy lady ""wendy"" started talkin to me as I was getting ready to lunge her...turns out to be the lady who broke her out.  knows jack shit about horses..whatever.  It was amusing for a while.  Got our list for when we give our debates in class...and me and joVanna are going LAST! yippie! =D yay! Ate lunch quick, showered, called the madre and talked to her for a while.  Got an email about houston...Christina said she's gonna ride him this week prolly and teach some lessons off of him.  That should be good cause he prolly hasnt been ridden since I was home! Got a 23 out of 25 on my psyc project *super excited face since I did it the night before and made half of it up!* repro was good, got an 8 out of 10 on my quiz and actually semi understood what we were talking about today! woo-hoo! =D Got ready for work and was all flustered when I was leaving cause someone keeps calling me but its restricted...so i dont know who it is and they left an *urgent* message tonight of straight mexican music...not gonna  lie...it was hilarious.  anywho, got half way across campus when i realized my keys were in the room.  shit. went to dining hall got the foci keys..drove the foci to work..turns out i'm not even on the schedule at work.  oops..hahaha back to the dining hall..then, on my way back to the room, i'm walking up the stairs and a gorilla comes walking down the stairs...and waved and kept on walkin...WHAT?! haha yea..so..what a crazy day! =D now time for homework!"

"event","well, i'm home for spring break...and instead of basking in the nice sun of texas, i've been at the barn all day everyday. (not that i'm complaining...at all!) I'm working on buying a horse. A horse of my own. Its definatley a long process. But I'm glad to beable to be here for it (instead of in ohio hearing about it.)Dr. White (the vet) came out and did a check on houston to make sure everything was a-ok...and he was worried about an enlargement on his back leg...so we took some x-rays (ca-ching ca-ching) and i hear the results from those tonight. I'm confident that those will come out fine. What i'm worried about is his weight and muscle tone. (or lack there of...) The barn that houston is at is very nice (under construction, but will be nice when its done) but its 50 minutes away from my house and about the same from christina's house. Its on her parent's property...so she's been having her mom feed and clean stalls for her. What worries me is that her mom doesnt always feed them.......she just turns them out to eat grass. Stef and I got done riding at 3:00 the other day and her mom told us to go ahead and feed them because they hadn't eaten yet that day. Houston has lost a ton of weight since christmas. and alone with the weight, his muscle tone is gone as well. (you can see his lil hip bones) I love Christina, and I love the barn, but realistically...it is 50 minutes away, he has lost all of his muscle and way too much weight for my liking (and if i plan on showing him this summer...he's gonna need both of those back and both of which are not going to appear magically the first few weeks i'm home. I'd love to take him up to school with me...NOW but thats obviously not happening...i'd love to take him to a barn closer to home (but the question is...where? and how would i tell christina i am taking him somewhere else...) oh wow. i was ready for the purchasing of the horse...but not this part of it...we'll see how it all turns out...wish me luck..."

The business office just pisses the hell ou of me.  the mail room is using the pony express to get mail to us.  I am STILL getting fucking bills for my collar bone from the hospital and from the orthopedic doctor.  I still have these fucking bumps.  And nothing's gonna be done about it until I get home for spring break.  I just wanna go home...away from all of this.  Sure, a bunch of really great things happened to me in the past few weeks, but all of them would be the same if I was at home except for the team, and...its not like that matters much except I get to jump 2 maybe 3, 2 foot fences once a week.(maybe I should have listened to everyone else when they said it was a waste of time).  I wanna go home to my best friends.  The ones I talk to about everything, who I can smile and laugh and not worry around.  I want to go home to my boyfriend.  To laydown in his arms and know that he's really there, not just his voice.  I want to go home to my horse.  who is really now mine.  I want to go sit in his stall and know that he's really mine, not just people telling me he is.  I want to go home to a barn (even though I dont really have one currently).  To be under the instruction of someone who has faith in me jumping over 2 foot.  I have the confidence to do whatver, but I miss my trainer having the same confidence in me.  I want to go home to NO SNOW.  I want to go home to a place of less stress and somewhere that I feel.....at home. *sigh*"

"event","Lets see...IHSA show was Saturday.  Went very well, surprisingly.  We were done by 3:30....big shock there, We won...by one point!  I rode Cecil, Reba, and Hook for schooling, too bad they were all being schooled at the same time...UGH. Needless to say, after making a fool out of myself with reba, and after getting somewhat yelled at by Sam for being ""unorganized"" I had to school CeCe (mr. dangerous jumper over 2'6) over the open height on the Intermediate course cause the Otterbein riders can't call where they're going and I was ALWAYS in the wrong place.  UGH. I really was excited about schooling the horses, but it woulda been a bit helpful if I was informed about what was going on.  oh well..whatever, but judging by my wonderful rides, I prolly wont be showing...i'm over it.  
Parents met with Christina on Sunday.  He's mine. =D big smiles.  So I guess dreams do come true...12 years of wishing, finally paid off! haha =D yippie! excited face!
Fuerst had a temp today, and the snots. I hope its nothin serious.  Dr. henniger took blood samples from her and Diva. We'll see what this progresses to.  Hopefully nothing much.  
Started my job on Monday.  I think i'm gonna like it.  Should have waited a few weeks to start, but oh well.  Corporate apparently is not happy with the server's knowledge of the menu so...they're issuing a test out to all of the servers to see how well they know the menu.  and guess what...its in a week and a half.  EEK! haha oh joy. So, ontop of my sick filly, my 18 credit hours on campus, and sleeping.....I have to memorize the menu for Steve's... The manager told me if she feels comfortable with how i'm doing by Saturday, she might give me a table or two on Saturday.  yikes! talk about jumping right in!"

Talked to my mom the other day and she just finished a book that was all about being thankful for the good things that happen to you.  Not being selfish, but being thankful for them.  I am able to buy an amazing horse that I probablly never would have gotten to buy on a normal day from a normal owner.  I made the varsity eq. team, and although many people on the team think its a load of shit, it really means alot to me to be part of the team, and not just a bitch worker on JV.  I know its early morning hours and whatnot, but ya know..if you're passionate about it, it doesnt really matter right?  thats my take on it atleast.  I'm making immense progress with my filly, although she bit stef today (sorry!!) she's been very good.  very obediant with most everything i do to her.  I got on her in the round pen today which was exciting and due to the fact that she has no withers, my saddle kept slipping so we called it a day and will put a no slip pad on tomorrow.  I am not showing this weekend, but I am getting to warm-up Cecil, Hook, and Reba.  So, at least i'm gettin to ride something right? =D and I get to ride Cecil! =D excited face! I also got a job at Steve's Dakota Grill (outback, ohio style...nice steak house)  I start on Monday, and although all i've heard from...anyone...is that i'm gonna hate serving and blah blah blah...I'm excited about it.  I will be making more $$ than I am right now...so, I really dont care if I like it or not...I'll be making some $$...so whatever. Thats bout it for now!

Fuerst.  3 year old oldenburg, dark grey. super super spoiled...therefore, a HUGE bitch. tries to bite me everyday. kicking is also common. i'm getting good at jumping out of the stall and punching her. its good..=D hehe Janet told me the owners have already sat on her apparently.  she's just a BITCH! haha oh well..we'll fix it. maybe. 

Christina emailed me asking if i would buy Houston (her pride and joy).  said she'd give me a ""REALLY GOOD DEAL"" which i considered to be $8000 or something. HA. she said I could have him for 2500.  holy crap right?! yea, thats what i said. which ended in a restless night of not being able to sleep cause theres not a shot in hell i can afford him. everyone says they will help me, but i dont relly trust them. sorry guys, i've just been let down so many times...its just hard. I can board him up here for 165 a month...95 if I provide hay and grain, feed at night, and clean my stall. I can make 200 dollars a month, thats not the problem. and maybe thats a sign. he is 12. but thats still a good 5 or 6 years under his belt of competitiveness (and with his heart and mind...atleast that.) other problem...so say i get him...super cool jumper. now i can't afford to show him. UGH. sometimes, i hate horses. geez. sure, money doesn't buy happiness...but it sure as hell would make things a TON easier.

"event","This week has been a load of yucky shitty no good days. thank god next week is thanksgiving break and I get to go home for a lil while. Jumped Cecil around on Monday and he was really good..but Tuesday through today was the clinic...Tuesday was judging which was kind of interesting...then yesterday and today we got to ride.  Not so good...The clinicians (in my opinion) were horrible.  He kept making up chip the fences and if we didn't he would make us do it again until they chipped...and i wasn't aloud to touch my horse's face while we were flatting...which is understandable if you have a kinda high horse who gets worked up and you need them to relax...but cece was getting wilder cause he was free! ugh.  then today we had someother lady who was informed that our group was all beginners who had riddin for jsut a few years......AHHHH Me Kaitlyn and Charis were like umm...excuse me...yea..And when she put up a few cross rail s she looked around and asked ""now can you all jump this high??"" AHHH!  Granted I was in a lesson with fucking Terri and Carolina, I am SICK of being in that fucking lesson! AHHHH! I feel like shit...ugh. Maybe I'll say something to Sam...but then she'll prolly laugh at me...we;ll see...Home on Tuesday.  thank god.  I dont even care if we're going camping, i just wanna be home.  I will hopefully get to see Jenn and Ash and Nat!  Get to see the brother which is SUPER exciting! I've missed him a ton! Don't get to see that boy who drives me crazy. hopefully christmas time i will get to see that crazy kid.  i love how no matter how much shit i throw at him or how bad of a mood i am in...he still talks to me...:D thank you. really.  I need to stop bitching and get out of this funk that i'm in...I dont know whats been up w/ me lately..but its definatly something that hopefully a 3 hour plane ride and a week at home can fix.  It started to snow today.  Yesterday didnt count as snow.  they were lil snow pelletts fallin from the skyh...not really sleet...but kinda..i dont know, but they hurt when they hit you in the face...today was lil snow flurries...its pretty right now...i just wish the ground wouldn't get all yucky and ugly and covered in snow until April...yuck. Going to see Harry Potter Tonight. :D yay! excited face! :D"

"event","Blah.  that is how I feel and I dont know why.  I think I miss home a lil too much and I'm just not letting myself admit to it.  Excited to go home, but just found out that i'll be camping and fishing w/ the family for most of it.  When I agreed to camping I thought it would be a day or two...but we're spending Thanksgiving in the fucking camper.  UGH. oh well..could be worse..atleast i'll be in Texas.  Body Clipped Cecil.  He was better than I thought he'd be.  so yay for that.  Did everything except for his ears.  Tard ass.  thats all I have to say about it.  Poor Linnea got the wrath of CeCe this mornin in practice..if i knew they were using him I'd have turned him out on wednesday! haha oops!  oh well.  I went back out during freshman time and rode him and he was GREAT.  I love that horse so much! just wish he had better form w/ his knees over fences. bummer. huge bummer.  Went to the Dr. and got me some pills that will hopefully help me concentrate.  we'll see.  miss you a bunch, more in the past day or two."

"event","Why did my wonderful wek have to come to a bitter sweet end?  The week was awesome.  Got to ride cecil and jump quite a bit.  He was an ass on Thursday so we ended the week with a gag in his mouth and boy does he respect my hand now! :D yay. he jumped around so well today! and i kinda felt like i was on a jumper with how much power i had in that bit.  too bad the poor guy's jumping form sucks butt. he's wicked cute though and SO much fun! :D i still love him!  Classes weren't too terribly bad.  Moved the room around, Put both mine and stef's beds on the floor.  very nice. Love it! :D now we can jump on our beds! :D:D yippie! hehe Called Renee, asked her about an exercise we use to do that i liked and wanted to know how to set it up.  She was happy to hear from me, told me to stop by and say Hi while I was home.  Called (or attempted to) Laura.  but she was at yet another show.  surprise surprise.  Talked to dalton a whole bunch.  Love that kid. such a sweetheart.  cant wait till christmas break.  Then, my great week came to a close at about 12:30 PM.  STICKY DIED.  We gave him a nice burial.  Played Amazing Grace on the computer and said our goodbyes, gave a courtesy flush.  (p.s. don't use the first stall in the 3rd floor bathroom.)  Got a new one though.  He's much more active and fatter! so cute.  named this one Corona.  Kinda feel like a fuck up at the barn.  I feel like Sam thinks i'm a beginner and dont know anything.  I know she's kidding half of the time, but sometimes i'm not so sure.  She talked to us about the Team DeVille show up at Lake Erie...tag team Jumpers kind of thing.  She wants to take 4 of the sophomores.  On Pongo, Milton, Moose, and Woody.  I want so bad to do it, but I have a feeling that she will be taking Matt, Meryl, Natassia, and Joanna if she can convince her to go.  that'd be the team I'd pick.  She doesn't want to ""break"" me again..so i dont think she's gonna let me do.....anything.  ugh. I just wish I could show her that i'm not an Idiot and although I have not shown on the A- Circuit, I kinda know my shit.  or atleast i kinda feel like I do.  otherwise, I've been lied to.  Stef's showing this weekend at Otterbin.  Good luck roomie, hope ya do well.  Wish I was there to cheer ya on!"

Between Sam as a witch, Matty as a vaulter, Janet as a cave woman, Jim as the horse show fairy, Joanna as a bull rider w/ her firey steed esther-mae, and scott chasing matt (on woody) around a circle dressed as the guy from scream (that was some scary shit!!)  It was hilarious!  Printed my pictures also!!! SOOOO good!! I was so happy!! CeCe was a good boy having his pictures taken!!!  Got to jump around on Cecil today quite a bit, and he was being sooo good!  Sam had me ride down the 5 stride and when he landed off of the oxar he started to crow hop a lil bit..and sam was like umm..yea, you're done for the day...haha he was good though!  :D  I got my brirthday present from Jenn today! :D:D  I LOVED IT!!! Got Big Fish, the Rob Thomas CD, Brownie Mix, and an AMAZING picture of us, AND!!! a PONCHO!!!! hahaha all of those are inside jokes...so, just laugh cause its funny. :D not much else to say for now."

Born on the 7th day of month gives you a tendency to be something of a perfectionist and makes you more individualistic in many ways. 
Your mind is good at deep mental analysis and complicated reasoning. 
You are very psychic and sensitive, and you should usually follow your hunches. 

You may not take orders too well, so you may want to work alone or in a situation where you can be the boss.

I am a little less stressed now that I can ride.  Still pretty frazzled, but riding again is startin to sort things out.  I still have some stuff I need to sort out in my head, but hopefully that'll come around soon.  thats bout it...need to go see fiona about my shoulder but i dont wanna cause i know she's gonna tell me i shouldn't be riding.  so..yuck."

I'm going to miss Mid-terms which means I have.....1 grade at the barn right now and that was a paper I had to write for Sam.  She told me to think of something to do since I have NO grades....and I have a feeling its gonna end up being ""what did you learn being in the arena w/ sam"" which sucks cause although i've learned alot, its not stuff you can write a paper about.  so..hopefully she'll come up with something else for me to do.... my shoulder feels fine, I want to go back to the Dr. and be like ok..take the x-rays and let me ride.  NOW.  ugh.

He's classey.  Much better than Biff.  He's shit."" haha God I love her!  She saw me at the barn on friday and in the middle of the Freshman riding evaluations was like Kayce! is that you up there?!  and came over to talk to me...The freshman were still riding around and jumping...Jill was like ""umm, sam?  Sam?  SAM!  will you watch this?? "" haha oh wow.  But she bought me a ""present""...its a tube of saddle tight.  :D  hehe so funny. After Matty rode Biff we went to Kohls and I returned my jeans that had to tags and no receipt...:D YAY! and got some that fit better.  Yippie Skippy!  Then Came back and Went to dinner at 5.  After Dinner joVanna, Stef, Rach, nausage and I went to Kohls again, TSC, and Pet Supplies Plus!  Stef and I got a frog named Sticky.  :D  he's real cute!  hehe I held him today when stef cleaned his cage..he's crazy fast!  he was hoppin around like crazy in my hands!  Stef, Rach and I went to the football game after we brang Sticky back to the room.. I went down and saw Fiona cause my shoulder still hurts like a bitch.  Dr. Stump said he wants x-rays on tuesday.  Might be a crack or fracture in my collar bone or something w/ my rotater cuff.  Poop.  It hurts like HELL.  I got back from the barn today and couldn't get my shirt off..stef tried to help (thanx buddy!) but it wouldnt come off cause my arm hurt so bad...so we said fuck it and left it on...I did finally get it off though and showered.  yay.  now i'm sittin in the room lookin at sticky. :D hehe"

They were having a barn party and I was out there to ride Cinnabar and they were like ""COME EAT!!"" so...i did!  then I rode Cinnabar...she was pretty good, very frisky when out in the pasture...wow!  I set up a few jumps and jumped her over em for a lil while, she was very good.  :D  so much fun!  Saturday Morning I had to be out at Briarwood (a retreat center that the church choir was at) at 8:30 and was in charge of 9 kids until 6:00.  whew!  I got paid 100 bucks for it though!  I was super stoaked about it until I left and realized that meant I got 1 dollar per kid per hour I was there.  Bummer!  oh well...they were pretty good kids.  Sunday I went to Church, got to see Erin and Kelsey.  Brent is back from Hungary!!! :D:D:D:D SOOOOO happy to see him!! The last time I saaw him was my Sophomore or Junior year of H.S.  When he went off to Ireland.  Also got to see Karin and her Baby!  Kendall is adorable.  5 weeks old, and soooo precious!!  She's doin well, Definatley strange to see Karin with a kid.......but, it was very good to see her.  Kels. wanted to go see ehr this week, but i'll bet money we wont go.  Thats just how it always works out.  Oh well.  Went shoppin w/ my mom after church.  We were in Costco and my mom was like I dont like this.  I was like what? she goes I see boys checking you out..I was like huh? she was like but, it makes me proud to be your Mom!  hehe I love my mommy!! she's so cute!  Went to Jenn's later on Sunday afternoon.  Got there and hung out and talked for a while...then her friend Tyler came over and we went to pick up..... (drum roll....) IKE!!!!!!!! and Layne.  We went down to Deep Ellum cause Tyler was gettin a Tattoo...after the tatoo excursion we were gonna see a movie but none were playin so we went back to Jenn's and then went to Taco Bell...Came back and watched Garden State (new fav. movie!!!) It was AMAZING. I am going to buy it AND the soundtrack tomorrow.  After the movie, we somehow started makin fun of poor Ike.  He got mad at us and went outside.  So I ran out there and sat w/ him for a while and we were talkin...at about 4 Layne decided she was hungry so we went to iHop.  Ike ordered the entire menu..hahahahaha dropped them off at Layne's at about 6:00 and when we got back to Jenn's, we passed out till 2...HAHAHA Man Jenn and I slept HARD!!! lolz Got up and listened to a bunch of music w/ Jenn and made 2 Cds for me to Download..and got home about 4:30 and took a  shower! hahaha Mom and I went to Armend's for dinner.  yum yum yum!  Then went and got my glasses perscription fixed so I can wear em (and see..) if I want to now! yay! 

Took a stupid online quiz thing today about your icons for different moods.....the first one was the love icon...and it said mine was this ""the notebook"" scene of them kissing.  hmmm... awkward  if you know anything about my relationship with the notebook...


--> Jenn, I have had SOOO much fun hangin out w/ you this summer.  You are one of my BEST friends and its weird to say we only met last summer.  I feel like i've known you for my whole life!

"event","so have i told y'all that my neighbors are retarded?  well, if i haven't... they are.  I was pulling outta my drive way to meet Natalie for lunch when I see my street LINED (both sides) with cars.  Not a problem? HA.  My neighbors dont understand the concept of parking apparently.  there was JUST enough room for me to fit through (with a foot on each side of my truck clearing their mirrors. )  When I came back from lunch, they were STILL there.  So I attempted to go down the other street that connects to mine.  I get no more than turning my blinker on and see some guy with his F-250 parked directly in the middle of the road.  still attached to his F-ing SHRIMP BOAT! I swear to you...it WAS a shrimp boat.  and he was cleaning it in his driveway..still connected to his truck which was blocking the road.  so, I had to come BACK down my street and weave my way through the stupid cars.  So anyways...Rode Bozley again on Thursday.  Pretty good ride, Laura said he looked like a dressage horse.  <--yay kc!  :D  Rode Cinnabar today.  she was very good, I rode her in the pasture and jumped her a lil too.  she is such a sweet horse!  


So while in hawaii, talking to my Auntie Ann, I had mentioned that I wished that I had gotten my Poppy's saddle.  Because he had this REALLY cool western saddle that he use to ride in, it had an ""H"" on the horn and on the sides.  It was GORGEOUS.  But when he passed away, My aunt donated it (out of my Nana's wishes) to the Historical Museum in town.  Needless to say, Being the.....HORSE PERSON in the family, I was really dissapointed to know that someone else was getting it.  So, Today..I took the initiative to call around to a few places and see if I could locate it.  I thought it was just gonna make me feel better callin a few places...well, I found it.  haha I get home from the barn with a message saying ""Hi Kayce, this is Barbra From the San Dieguito Historic Museum.  I was just calling you back about your grand father's saddle.  Hutch donated it to us when he passed away and We have it and pictures of it.  If you want any more information, give us a call back."" Holy Shit.  haha I dont know what to do now!  Cause I really would LOVE to have it.  I mean I kinda have a right to it...dont I?  My poppy painted me a picture of a horse's head and for my birthday gave me the original copy.  and on the bottom is says ""to my horsey grand-daughter"".  I just think that It would be cool to keep something as special and valuable as a saddle like that IN the family.  I would love to have it in my house with the painting of the horse above it.  Or even in my barn lobby one day.  who knows, but I just feel like it belongs in the family...not in a museum.  anywho, I am suppose to call my aunt and figure out if we can get it back.....If you donate something, can you take it back 2 years later?? hmm..we'll see...but, as for now..i'm off to bed.  any suggestions bout the saddle, let me know!! :D"

Natalie came and joined in on the fun also..haha poor natalie, what was I thinking telling her to come over and hang out w/ camp staff..lolz needless to say we are a crazy bunch of kids..hehe But I think she still had a good time.

Rode last night and tonight with Laura again.  I rode a horse named Bozley.  He's HUGE! 18 hh for those of you horse ppl out there and for those of you non horse ppl, the top of his back is 6 feet tall.  =-O!!! needless to say, he made my leg and body look.....normal on him!! :D:D:D yay!! :D  He was a totally different ride than what I am use to.  He use to do the grand Prix with a big german guy...not lil ole me! haha   He definatley gave me a run for my money though.  I had figured him out for the most part by today.  Jordan was out there and watched my lesson.  I found out AFTER the lesson that Bozley is HER HORSE! AHHHH!!! haha  SURPRiSE! yea, definatley glad I didnt know that before the lesson! hahaha WHEW!   I have a bruise on my inner thigh from riding bozley in a not so comfy saddle...ouch.  by bruise I dont mean one you can feel only.....its a black bruise...OuCh!

got to spend 10 days in Hawaii w/ my family when I got back from camp..It was my whole family, my dad's twin sister's whole family, and his lil sister's whole family, and their mom!! so.. there were 6 cousins, 2 step cousins, 6 aunts and uncles, and 1 85 year old nana! it was awesome!!!  Oahu is sooo pretty!  We stayed on Waikiki and got to hang out there and tour around the whole island.  it was a ton of fun!

left hawaii at 4:55 on sunday afternoon and got in to texas at 5:00 monday morning.....took a shower, ate some cereal and went to work (day camp at church) at 9:00!  I did day camp all week from 9 till 2...it was a good way to keep me occupied and I made $230!  I bit the bullet and decided to schedule some lessons with laura to finish out the 9 i still have.....cause i figured i would beable to ride some nice horses..so....my first lesson i rode a horse named dewey and apparently (so i hear from nat) she really liked my riding!  so basically I am now stuck in the middle cause I have hated this woman for almost a year now and it turns out that she actually likes my riding and wants me to come back over holidays and ride...so i just dont know!!! but, none the less its goin well!

Camp was amazing...i love the people on staff and i am going to miss you all TERRIBLY.  I want to bottle you all up and take you to Ohio with me! or better yet...COME VISIT!! :D:D  I learned alot about myself this summer at camp.  I learned to just let go and have fun, I learned to stop living my life backwards and look forewards cause whats behind me I can't change.  I learned that your best friends are the ones who stick by you and the ones you can put your trust in are the ones who put their trust in you.  I learned that we really DO make a difference in those kids lives.  I learned that being up from 5:30 one morning till 4 the next makes you go CRAZY.  I learned that the more you put out the more you take in.  I learned that rain does AMAZING things.  and last (but CERTAINLY not least) I learned that truth or dare in dogwood (the first time) can NEVER be topped!! :D:D:D:D  I had the best summer ever, and although there were some rough times, It was a great way to end my camp career.  <--sad to say but that was my last year working for grace presbytery at summer camp.  I am currently on the market for a barn.  If anyone would like to have me at their barn, as long as it has horses to ride and well..thats really bout it...let me know...cause FMEC is no more......and try-outs for varsity are the 2nd week we get up to school which means in about 4 weeks and if i want a shot in hell (which i DONT have right now) at making it this year........i need to get on some horses!!  as for now though..i am off to hawaii with my family.....by family i mean there will be 16 total people!  waa-hoo!!"

Patrick let us jump around quite a bit.  Went out to Pilot Point and saw Kathy on Tuesday.  She is doing very good, I rode this cute bay horse named Mr. Smokey Bear. He was very sweet and lots of fun. We were out in a huge field riding..it was great.  he's for sale, and apparently Renee came and looked at him.  Kathy said she tore the poor horse apart.  but hey, its a school horse! they're gonna have some imperfections!! haha he had one droopy ear.  it was pretty funny cause he'd be standing there looking @ you and his one ear would just drop flat. and he did the goofy parker head tilt thingy.  But It was alot of fun!! :D:D I missed kathy so much!  Mom and I went to the mall last night.  I got my watch battery replaced for free after convincing the girl that i didn't get a receipt with my watch cause they mailed it to me...tried on some jeans, fossil jeans are WIERD!  didn't fit..at all.

Thursday:   morning had a lesson with patrick on Stoner!  it was good, I've missed my boy.  Definitely noticed how much I had actually learned from Findlay.  I had never been able to get Stoney in a frame and keep it there and have him react the instant I ask him to do something.  Nat and I went to Wendy's and had to deal with the newly civilized area of Roanoke.  Went to Vicky Secret.. ;););) hehe Then off to Jeff's w/ Nat!  We had a great time, glad to have finally gotten over.....""it""....haha but really, Jeff and I are...friends again.  I know..you never thought you'd hear that from me, but yes.  Spent the night at Nat's house, got toothpaste on her bed..HAHA good times.  :)  
Friday: hung out w/ Nat, saw the motor home, came home....did a bunch of nothin...rented a movie w/ my mom and had a movie night!! Fun Fun :) :) Also talked to the boy until like 3:00..haha I miss him so much and wish that I could just call him and go over to his house and hang out.  I think our relationship would be TOTALLY different if that was possible.  :(  *sigh* :( 
Today!!!!  Went to Hidden Lakes and saw Brittany, Chelsea, and all of them.  Talked to Chelsea for quite a while.  We had a good talk!! Saw Jackie W. also.  hehe she's SO sweet!!!  Then Went to Quail Hollow and ordered a bridle plate and a martingale plate.  yay!  Stopped at FMEC on my way home and Helped Gail out with Ronnie cause she hurt her hand again.  :(  So I took care of the white beast!! haha he's a good boy though.  Paid my dues to Koby and Stoner.  :)  My Stoner is so good.  I walked in his stall and he turned around and walked over to me and put his head right against my chest so I could hug his head and he just stayed there till I let go, then he took a step back and licked my hand.  I was like I love you horse!! :):):):):)  Came home and decided that it was a good idea to try to put my saddle plate on..cause Quail Hollow told Nat I could do it.....Well....I didnt!  I was using my dad's power drill with the flat head screw cause my saddle plate came with screws...(strange) well..to make a long story short, I dont have a steady hand and the drill wobbled off of the screw and luckily (for my thumb) it nicked my saddle first then went INTO my thumb!!  OUCH!!  It went it pretty damn deep!  not too bad really, but if it had not hit my saddle first, it definatley would have been worse and I prolly would have stitches in my Thumb right now!! haha oh man! it was a close call! My saddle's ok too! yay!"

"event","Speedy re-cap of the past 10 days...ready, set, GO!!! (speedy cause i'm really tired, bored, wanna go to bed, my laptop has 13 minutes left on its battery, and i'm too lazy to go get the charger!)

Monday (the 2nd) drove 900 miles to Oklahoma....got into Stillwater at 10:45 and met kent and Nat at IHOP.  fun fun.  Mom surprised me and drove up on Tuesday and took Dad home.  Stayed and hung out with Nat and brother till thursday.  Wednesday night nat and I went out with her friends..fun fun fun : ) : ) : ) hehe good times there.  ;) *wink wink* haha Thursday, went to lunch with kent, scoped out nat's apartament for next year w/ her roomie, then heaaded home!  Thursday night through saturday afternoon I unpacked my WHOLE life!  crazy.  re organized my room and got everything cleaned and put away. yay.  Sunday was mothers day and youth sunday.  Good ole jeffrey was there.  i was very civil..be proud : ) haha jk no hard feelings! lolz

:: pause while i go take my lazy ass to get my charger cause apparently at 9 minutes my computer tells me it is about to shut off due to no power if i dont plug it in.... ::

youth Sunday was very nice.  so many youth members now.  its crazy!  Ash came up for the sr. recognition thingy.  14 sr.s graduating.  CRAZY!! wow.  I think there were 6 of us last year! haha Erin's back at the church.  yay.  She's also engaged!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! even bigger YAY! hehe   Monday i went shopping with kent, went shopping with nat, went to the barn (saw my stoner hehe), and gave ronnie a bath.  Tuesday was spent doing.....................................(obviously nothing cause i have no clue what i did on tuesday..haha and that was only yesterday!!) Oh yea! I went out to Las Colinas and watched Erica ride.  cool instructor.  might be takin a lesson out there once a week..not sure.  she was french, really sweet.  

anywho..today!  went to the barn and watched nat's lesson at 2, (sulked around the barn..) doenst feel like home.  people tacking up horses and handing them to the rider.  people paying to have their horses bathed and clipped.  one option of board being 1200 dollars a month to have full board, baths, lessons, fully clipped, and your horse fully tacked up and tacked down for you.  <---remind me why again we ride horses?  last time I checked, there was more to riding than.....RIDING.  there is that lil thing called ""bonding w/ your horse"".  after all, if you dont bond w/ your horse, he doesnt know if he can trust you..and if he cant trust you, he's not going to want to work for you.  and if he doesnt want to work for you...well hell..ya might as well saddle up a cow! Laura, although she had good things to say during nat's lesson, it was nothing i hadnt been told by Julie up at Findlay.  She (laura) kept smiling at me with a look on her face like she was trying to something to say.   when eventually, she said ""i saw a picture of you when you were small."" i was like huh? ""i saw a picture of you when you were small.""  oh, in the lobby? and she walked away.  <---WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! haha   On monday she saw me standing with nat in the lobby and said to me..""have i met you?"" ...wow, purely genuine.  boy, that really made me want to ride out there..everytime i was home on break i was out at the barn playin w/ stoner, and yes..she HAS met me.  i came over to her barn w. nat and got a tour of her house with nat.  but...all she remembered was nat.  which is fine cause nat is what she wanted..and has wanted.  and i'm really happy for you nat (no matter what it looks like, i am) cause she will definatley make you a great rider, and if i could get over the bump in my path and just say fine.  i'll do it, maybe i would ride with her, but there is this thing in my mind that i'm almost trying to prove to myself that i will not go back on my own word.  she is one of the reasons i no longer have a trainer.  remind me again why i would want to ride with this woman?  *wow..so i caught a huge wave of energy and totally just went OFF about the barn..hehe sry guys*  have a lesson with Patrick in the morning though.  should be good.  riding my stoner.  yay.  hopefully he will throw me on more than just stoner this summer though.  Doubt I'll ride anything of Laura's unless I ride w. her..oh well, thats what i get for being stubborn.  

so much for a short/speedy entry! haha"

Parker was a good boy while I braided his mane.  He let me do the whole thing, AND the forelock with out any assistance (shoulder twitch) I was very happy!  My braids actually looked ok too! yay!  He was kinda being a sped while I was warming up so I put him on the lunge line and let him run around for about 10 minutes...my heart skipped a beat cause when I brang him back down to the trot, he took a bad step and kinda gimped for a few steps..but then he was fine..thank god!  Went to warm up over a fence or 2 in the small arena before my test and he decided to be a spaz and wouldn't canter to the fence.  he like forgot how to canter.  then, the lights went out.  Oh joy...let me tell ya...so i jumped off of him and hand walked him until they came back on and jill said i could just walk him around the barn until matt, kaitlyn, and ambre were done w/ their tests to calm him down.  so like 30 minutes later...I got on  (at 6:30..when we were checking out) to ride my test.  He was SOO good, I think he knew it was the last thing he had to do and I was counting on him and I think he sucked it up and stuck it out for me.  He stayed pretty round for the whole test and even at the canter!  he broke at the counter canter but we got it back..whatever, I was happy with him..VERY happy.  And i'm done letting people borrow things...both of my seam rippers and my scissors were not in my possession...and since it was 7:00...I couldnt find anyone to get em back to take his braids out..Heather B. gave me her scissors to take his braids out..poor guy.  Then he got turned out with the devil (aka Vinny) in the rain..w/ no shed.  urg.  Ate dinner at Millers.  yum : )  Today was nice, it started out as a cold day but ended up pretty nice.  No Med. Terminology till the final..so that means that I got to do NOTHING today! hehe Went to Meijers and got some tuperware bins to pack my stuff in to go home.  Kinda crazy...only 10 more days up here..then 4 good months in texas! wow!  The FEI World Cup Finals are going on right now...I WISH I KNEW IF/WHERE THEY WERE PLAYING ON TV!!! grr..guess i'll just have to buy the DVD next year...lolz   Had the ANRC awards banquet tonight...I got 6th in the Hunter over fences, 3rd in Eq. over fences, and 4th in the Sportiff! :) so proud of my boy :)  Dee Dee handed me my 6th place ribbon and she goes ""and even on parker! good job!"" hehe :D yay!  We got some ugly-ass ""participation ribbons"" that are green w/ the side ribbons rainbow..wow.  quote by joanna sabato ""think of these next time you dont have shavings"" lolz good one Jo!  Poor Parker today.:(  I went to visit him in his stall and the poor guy's leg was HOT and swollen...so I kneel down to look at it and there is a huge open gash on his leg.  so I went and cold hosed it for a while, and cori and jolie came over to look at it and they told me to put a standing wrap on it w/ some furazone on the cut and...(here is the kicker) leave him in for the night!!!!!!!!!!!!! *GASP* I think they've finally (possibly) grasped the concept of....caring for injured horses! lolz funny stuff..told matt and he was like ""here ye here ye..let it be known that..."" :) good times.  Got to play gymkhanna games for the barn..hehe Tioga was a golden steed.  :)  she did good.  too abd she was afraid of the blanket or we just might have beat squirt's team..lolz oh well, we had a blast : )"

"event","Wow.  So Sunday was quite possible the worst day of my life.  This one tops the rest.  Got up at 8:30 caue we had to be at the barn at 9 to get ready for Zones. We did....basically nothing for 2 hours.  Then we got the horses out to be lunged.  I gave them burke and then about 20 minutes later i found out that he was pulled..oh well! prolly good for him to get out anyways!  So, Burke was pulled..that means I had NO job all day...not that i'm complaining or anything...but all i did was sit in the arena and babysit horses when needed.  So, it comes time to school...Michelle had a few of the JV rider school, one of which who isn't even on the team anymore cause they didn't go to practice or the last show schooled over fences.  a few of the other JV riders schooled on the flat.  guess who was sitting on the wall the whole time? Yup..yours truley!  I really dont know why I bust my ass so hard for the team anymore.  I mean I get there early for practices (once a month..) to make sure my horse is nice and clean for practice.  I have been at every show, busted my ass at the show doing anything and everything.  and guess who gets to school? the rider who wasn't at the past 2 shows and who wasn't at the last practice and who i'm pretty sure is kicked off of JV.  Why again am I trying so hard?  Its obviously not paying off.  Maybe I should start doing Jack shit and then they will notice me?  who knows...who cares...

Talked to Robin at the show and told her I set up an appointment w/ Dr. Dillon (OT advisor) and she was like well..I already talked to him.  AHH..She said that he said the equine/OT thing will not work out.  AHH...WHAT?! damn it!  So, I now have to go to a meeting tomorrow w/ this guy and listen to him tell me that this is not possible.  well hell.  I have no clue what I am going to do now.  everything I wanted to do is now ruined.  I don't even know why I'm up here...I mean I love it..yea, but what am I doing here?  I dont even know.

Got pics of Davy.  :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(  talk about ripping out your heart. Pics of him holding a HUGE gun in iraq with his finger on the trigger cause they are always on guard.  He looks so different.  tan, long hair, cuts all over his face. :(  made me cry.  I miss him SO much.  

Talked to Dalton and poor guy had to be the receiver of all of this shit that happened to me today.  sorry babe.  thanks for listening : ) i love you : )

Talked to Nat too.  Wow.  we hadn't had one of..those..talks in a long time.  we talked for an hour and a half..god I miss her!"

Judging..all we did was fight bout when to have the f-in exam.  and after a few of us said we have an exam ON TUESDAY MORNING AT 10....Jill decided that TUEDAY AT 10 wa good.  WTF! ugh..whatever..i'll just take it some other time..i didn't even wanna deal w/ it.  Parker schooled GREAT today!! : )  so happy!!  I was finding all of my spots and he was round and collected and listening and all nice and hunter like! : )  I still did the 6 in both lines for the courses, but I think he could have gotten the 5 if i had pushed him a little bit more.  Both courses went pretty well, Got most of the lead changes clean, a few were skip changes..but thats ok..I was happy w/ my rounds.  Then...I get back here...and ate dinner quick and walked down to the rec. therapy houe for the ""mandatory meeting""... I thought it was gonna be something like welcoming the freshman into the program and gettin to meet everyone and all that.  Not quite.  Dr. Folkerth came in and her eyes were pretty red..i was like hmm..thats not good..so they start talkin and the first thing that the Dean of Health Professions said was...""we regret to tell you that Dr. Folkerth will no longer be with us next year.  she is transfering jobs and will be heading up the RT program at University of Toledo.  ok..that sucks a little..caue she was awesome, and now they will have some new person in here who doesn't know what the hell they're doing..but i guess that could have been fun... my fun ended quickly when they informed us that after much discussion they have decided to ""phase out"" the rec. therapy program.  WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  Whelp..there goe my econd major..there goes 3 credits of taking med. terminology for no reason, and hopefully i can get out of anatomy next year.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  I was so excited...Lisa from Stajduhar Stables had offered me a Job for summers/when i graduated...as a therapeutic riding instructor (once i got certified) and it was gonna be great..but no..not anymore.  UGH.  I dont know what i'm gonna do now..i mean yea i'll stick w/ the equine @ findlay cause that is my main focus..but...what else? anything else?  URG.  Is it bad that all i want to do right now is go out to the barn and talk this over with parker and see what he has to say?  prolly..oh well..guess thats why i'm majoring in..horse."

"event","hmm..it was cold today..where was the sun? : (  Med. Term is officially over...except for two tests..but no more class! wow..weird.  Jumping Final Exam tomorrow...weird.  2 and 1/2 weeks till finals..REAL weird.  anywho..other than today being BRRR cold, it was good i guess..I had a blast in reading..: )  we got to do the course evaluations... <---the day i've been waiting for : )  I went to TOWN!  I said that the amount of homework (3 reading hours per week) is unreasonable for a  ONE credit class, the teacher ahs no clue what she is doing, she didn't say anything about my progress, the class is a total waste of my time, and my further remarks were...i would like to see the administrative staff of UF take the test and see how many of them pass it. : ) I had to bust my butt tacking up today..got to the barn at 3:05 and had to ride at 3:15!!! AHH!  haha parker was real good today though.  Scott said i did a good job over the jump with him since he is so stiff to begin with..he said that i really do all i can to help him be as loose as possible over the fence.  yay.  I stretched him all over and put liniment on him so hopefully he wont be sore/stiff tomorrow..cleaned my tack tonight..and oiled it.  it all nice and fancy for the ""show"" tomorrow..: ) yay.  time for bed.."

"event","sorry but yeah it's going to get a bit depressing over here.. way too much to do and so little time to do it.

I have to get this stuff straight in my head because I'm very close to losing it.
<lj-cut>
Let's start with the HP. it's the height of 1990s technology. It's pretty slow. I can't store stuff on it and somehow now my C drive is nearing full. 

Then we have the MacBook. which is about 5-8 years old now. It was my sisters but the battery is completely dead which means unless it's plugged in  it literally won't turn on and if I unplug it the machine dies instantly. So it's essentially a desktop. It's a bit faster than the HP but working on a Mac has it's own issues. 

Stuff like Photoshop man work wonderfully but I don't have $500 to buy it and I expending the effort to pirate a copy is way too much effort for my tastes, when there's a free option. Gimp. I've taught myself basic GIMP and I can do what I want for free in the clear.. I was more or less happy, but on a Mac using GIMP is it's own hassle. It has to open up X11 and then GIMP within that so you completely lose all UI consistency. I'm double clicking on stuff that I should be single clicking. it's crazy. Then uTorrent has a Mac version but my TV feed doesn't look right. Every show has a SD and HD torrent but uTorrent on Mac doesn't distinguish between the two. So everything is doubled but it doesn't tell me which is which. Plus you can't double click a torrent to play the file.

Plus I've become accustomed to GOM Player instead of VLC player. VLC plays nicer with odd file names but GOM has a much better UI. You can open one file and it loads the entire directory. That's insanely awesome. That and the EasyBrowser have changed my video playing life.

I'm having a real issue with iTunes right now. Specifically with backup burning. I decided to check out some videos that were free like the first two episodes of The Killing and such. Great fun and the HD versions actually play unlike normal HD files. Problem is they completely ate up my HD space. I'm literally rocking 200mb of free space only because I deleted 239mb of files an hour ago.

Right now my primary situation is that I have all these videos and I'd like to burn them to DVD but if you burn a playlist from iTunes it only burns the HD version. I'm concerned that if I burn the files manually I won't be able to combine them the way iTunes merges the HD and SD versions. I like that and I'd like to preserve that.

So my computers are stalling constantly. The MacBook is all beachballs. The HP is just dead weight. Still most of my work I do on the HP. I'm working on 4-5 websites and my local server is on the Windows computer. All my pictures are on that one. In each case the Mac programs I like lesser. Picasa is a great program for photos and such. iPhoto sucks because you don't have access to your files. I have textwrangler but installing a webserver on this MacBook is going to be a huge headache. uTorrent is great on Windows and barely workable on OSX.

Even more depressing last year I had a workable laptop. I actually backed up all my files including 5-10 gigs of music all my programs and settings, stuff I used like the insanely awesome Texter, and I can't uncompress myself on either computer.

I have a bunch of job applications but I don't have VVV so I can't access my disc database and find my resum&eacute; which means I have to start over from scratch and I hate writing my resum&eacute; you have to 'personally tailor' it to each job and that's a pain in the neck. I hate that nonsense. I'm just asking you to give me a job not be my sex toy. It's nothing personal, yet I have to pretend like you're the only job I want in my life.

3 things run smoothly on either of my computers, Torrents, Video playback, and iTunes (even as bloated as it is nowadays) oddly enough. everything else has stall times. Which means doing anything takes 3-4 times longer than it should. Checking my twitter timelines (2 personal accounts, 1 client account) takes hours because hootsuite is flash and any flash drives my productivity to a crawl. Heck I can't even watch YouTube on the HP. Checking my e-mail is a hassle not just because I get a ton of e-mail but because it takes me a long time to do simple sorting.</lj-cut>

Tune in next time where I complain about being 3 weeks behind on my audio editing, why I don't log into my favorite forums, how I kinda miss hanging out with people, and what I did today, and various ways Facebook makes me sad."

"event","it's 3:30 in the morning. I'm approaching delirium. 2-4AM is always the hardest part. I've given up trying to do real work, but I still have enough sense of self to catch up on my personal stuff. I haven't been to CAG(http://www.cheapassgamer.com) in weeks and there's a new contest plus I just got a Beta key. Oh speaking of contests I have a whole folder of daily contests I haven't had time to enter. Now's a good time for it no? I might as well finish The Cell (very colorful so far. Not quite at that Fifth Element level but not bad). Then I can find The Cell 2 (http://www.fastpasstv.com/the-cell-2-2009) and figure out how they botched it. My voicemail is full and I need to empty some of those messages. I have to meet my new fourth client on Tuesday and another on Saturday. Plus I have to call back one who didn't call for a meet on Monday. I write this down not so much because I think anyone reading this cares but so that I will remember. One of the things I need to do is find a sync for my calendar so I can keep this stuff down myself.

I was so very close to being caught up but looks like that's not gonna happen any time soon. It's not really fair of me to complain about my 'problems' not because of starving kids in Africa but because my problems are pretty good.

If this isn't making sense I might remind you about the semi-delirious state-- wait a sec-- ok that was the last set. Week three (http://hundredpushups.com/week3.html) is, well actually it's not as bad as i feared. I'm averaging 5 over the set 5 mins.

I really need to call my neurosurgeon see if he can tell me when they're going to crack my skull open and remove this bloody tumor. This waiting is .. well actually it's not too bad but everyone keeps asking me.

My father's day card this year will include a note about how good my father is at giving directions. I never thought it was all that special until I experienced someone else trying to give me directions in an area where I'm going blind. Alright my push-ups are done, my TV shows are queued up. I'm .. well not going to bed but this has to end sometime. Order of operations: TV, CAG, Movie.

P.S. Interesting fact 80% of the worlds glitter finds it's way in my bed or on my chair somehow."

"event","alright how did i get here (http://ping.fm/26BFO)


ok i saw the trailer at apple trailers for new movie Surrogates (http://ping.fm/vtjVq). it actually reminds me of something rather Asimovian.. but then pretty much anything with Robots can do that right. But it reminds me more specifically of the Elijah Baley series(http://ping.fm/fveh4). Anyway I noticed in the trailer it was based not on a novel like i thought at first but a graphic novel(http://ping.fm/6KFWV). So i figured why not check it out. Off to the pirate bay (http://ping.fm/KrzUV) and searching led me to a bunch of Sorprono's eps, the comics, and a dvd rip of 'A Perfect Fake'. clicking the link shows what appears to be a little girl. So now I'm confused as to why child porn appears to be in an imdb movie. I click the imdb link(http://ping.fm/9SZwZ) and it's unhelpful. i Google perfect fake. i get a disturbing review (http://ping.fm/FpV6U) but it sounds like most porn reviews done by women. that sounds sexist and while i don't mean to imply that women hate porn it's the only way i can describe the disgustedly dismissive tone of the review. as i think this it occurs to me that maybe i'm being presumptuous and the author doesn't hate porn and maybe it's the tone of the documentary that puts the subject matter in a creepy light. So i check out the veoh link(http://ping.fm/AsdJd). I'm familiar with veoh and video quality can be very good there. turns out not only is the quality excellent it appears you can get the entire documentary there for free if you install their widget. You only get a five minute preview without it. So while i'm watching the preview, I go thru the steps. I thought i had signed up for a veoh account long ago but maybe not.. anyway my username is taken and rather than go to my alt (which i hate doing) i try to do a password recovery on the off chance I did sign up and forgot the password. since i'm impatient i go back to the search results and click the youtube video(http://ping.fm/uPyzX). it mentioned an 'original blog post' and i thought i'd check it out to see if maybe there was a review or something that might indicate this video isn't just an overly disgusting sex-a-thon like the first review says. turns out though there's nothing really of merit there just the video embedded. So that's what I did for the past 45 minutes or so instead of watching The Unusuals. whew that's so many links in this it feels like an 800x600 formatted blog. remember when you couldn't find a layout that wasn't formatted for these mythical 800x600 screen resolutions that noone was using. Ugh those were horrible times."

"event","<strong>Moved to the top of entry: </strong>This week is E3 it's the biggest day in contemporary gaming (or it used to be) and no matter what for the next four days I'm going nowhere but in front of my computer to watch the press conferences stream. Later tonight I'll hook up my external harddrive and catch up on some manga maybe finish Old Boy or something.

<lj-cut text=""yeah it goes downhill from here"">it's getting so I don't want to answer my phone anymore. every conversation with my family is the same. If you're 12 or younger you're calling me to come over. you're also calling me every week day and up to 7 times if I don't answer. If you're older you're calling to find out what i'm doing. it may seem like variety but it's not. You're calling to give me a list of events to do in Toronto or to find out when I'm going to finish up school or if I have a job or how's the tutoring going and why i'm not starting it now. 

The third type of calls i get is from my sister who is here. These are the favor calls. These are the 2nd type to eat up my time. I starting going to Bible Study as a proxy for her. Suddenly I've become indispensable. Now my time is down on Sunday and Wednesday. 

Everyone who calls me thinks I don't think about what I do. On the contrary all I do is think about what I'm doing. It's just noone besides me has the complete picture. I've started to wonder if I'm really that likeable or if I just have a really good reputation. I've been in Toronto since the fall. I live with my sister and I don't go anywhere. Intentionally because I don't really have funds to go out. Yes still I've somehow made 4 friends all of whom I haven't seen in a month. So while I'm sure I'd like to sit at home and not wear out the car that's on it's last legs. I have people who expect to see me. People who (for various reasons) i need to see. These aren't always my reasons but they are reasons and I have to account for them. 

I'm very very seriously considering lying. Telling the truth is simple and in theory if I'm telling everyone the truth of every question they ask me, the plan is when I say ""I'm fine"" or ""I don't care"" i don't have to hear ""Are you sure?"".&nbsp; I started this almost two years ago now when she moved back home but it hasn't really worked. I just get lectures from Person A on why I should ignore person B, and then lectures from Person C on why I can't ignore Person B and why I need to ignore Person D who is telling me to ignore Person A.

Anyway I'm sorry to write entries just to complain but making time for Persons A, B, C and D means that I haven't had time to read anything for 2 weeks. the only time I've had lately to do anything is after 8 and at that point there's not much to do. Too tired out to read my e-mail, my blogs, my forums, my LJ, facebook, myspace those things all require a good chunk of time and as backed up as I am i keep needing more and more time. Not to mention I was offline entirely for the past 4 days. I've missed so many sweet craigslist deals. Too late now though. It's not even the first week of July and i'm tapped out of funds for three weeks. </lj-cut>"

My nephews see me all the time so they're going to have to get over it and everyone else will have to deal. I already missed early reg at FITC, Dragon*Con last year, Manhunt three times, online night weekly for 3 months. So for E3 I'm going to forcibly rip some time from the 8 influences that together take up all my time. I don't care if I have to watched awkward drum demos that look like an episode of The Office come to life I'm not saying boo to anyone I know. I'm a little excited maybe between shows I'll play some Portal.


Plans for tomorrow:
- do layout and copy for day one of the revival page 
- research photog websites for new 'client'
- incorporate picasa albums into current site
- buy new headphones (3rd this year :sigh:)
- buy frying pan
- visit nephews (last chance)
- research video editing
- edit videos
- create vimeo channel
- load videos to new channel
- send off e-mail to new client
- send off e-mail for database info
- buy reference book"

"event","so among the many things I'm now doing I'm trying to get a lightbox to work. turns out the original is incompatible with jquery. Ok fine there's&nbsp; ton of clones out there and SlimBox seems to do the trick and it's jquery native. it actually seems pretty b.a. I'm sifting thru pages trying to find some documentation and FAQs (which there's an appalling small amount, when I decided to just read the 'extra' js files and see if instructions are there. Turns out they are. Here's where my mind get's blown. There's one to autoactivate. Meaning I don't have to label the images they just auto pop. Plus there's another one that auto links picasa web albums. The church has a google account (acutally two) and with that much space.

This pleases me greatly. For the moment basic light box will do but the potential is huge. I have too much to do to play with it. I just got another gig building&nbsp; a web site for a photog. This will be interesting because it's so vastly different form what I've been doing currently and he wants to watch me do it. Ha. I'm sure he doesn't so I'll have to build it and then redo it for him. This weekend I'm on tech support duty, nephew 1 is celebrating his birthday, and nephew 2 wants me to come over during the week because he's at his Dads for the weekends. Plus the Uncharted:Drakes Fortune that I picked up from the library is due on the first and I've only gotten to play 40 minutes of it. I refuse to return it without getting a SINGLE trophy. I'm no trophy whore but that'd be weak. Add to this concoction the fact that i haven't had time to check my e-mail in 2 weeks not my RSS reader nor Cheapgamer.com. the only thing I'm actually caught up on is my podcasts.. and to be fair I'm big into gaming so this is like Golden Week for video games.. everyone goes radio silent before E3 (that reminds me I'm behind on a lot of my manga). I'm pretty caught up on TV but again the seasons are ending/ed. 

It's quarter to 4 and I'm considering for the third time in 2 weeks whether or not to go to sleep. Everytime i go to sleep past 2AM I don't wake up till late and waking up at 10:30-11 is my idea of wasting daylight. It's not my way. on the other hand I've choosen the stay awake route twice in a row now and I'm certain my tech support will be direly needed tomorrow evening. It is after all the begining of <a href=""http://gloriouschurch.ca/revival.php"">revival</a>.

According to the stats I'm getting. I think I'm the only person visiting the web page lately and that's because I'm testing my updates. (i accidentally put anal into my keyword box instead of my URL box and .. well you can imaging I didn't go into my analytics bookmark like i planned). If you feel like helping my rather unimpressive stats feel free to click the link. if you're bored you send me a list of what needs to be fixed. Maybe you'll see something I don't.

I really shouldn't use this space as a one-sided conversation but I have to wonder if I should instead of sleeping get up and move the car. They give out tickets every 3 hours and it's been out there since... well I don't know when exactly but in the morning my sister will have a cow if she can't see the car. hm.. since I'm going downstairs I could really go for some TimBits. At least I have some money now. Things are much easier this way.

OK it's officially 4AM now, in spite of Eminem's 3AM playing on the iTunes, so I'm going to get some donuts. They never have Timbits this late but at the very least it's a hot chocolate and .. i dunno <em>some</em> kind of donut for me. I'll try sleeping next weekend."

oh yahoo. I haven't logged into our services for 4 months so my account is 'deactivated'. after i reactivate my account and then reactivate my mail account (separate?) then I can log into messenger and voila I have 15 spam messages just sitting there waiting? really? is that how you're going to play me yahoo? I'd be upset but I haven't use my yahoo account for mail in many many years. It's strictly for the IM.

Speaking of IM I'm back. I've had this new laptop for a few weeks now and rather than spending my days wondering how i can use the currently (mostly) empty drive to hold the contents of my portable hard drive while I reformat it I've just decided to go ahead and start the customization process. Today I've installed an IMclient.&nbsp; I'm unfamiliar with Windows IM clients as a traditional Mac man but seems like it's between Miranda, Pidgin (a.k.a. GAIM) which I used in the past, and Digsby. I was all set to go for Pidgin but Digsby is the new client on the block so what the heck I'm going to give it a whirl. Now I'm trying to remember all my accounts. Now all my AIM accounts i have like&nbsp; 16-20 of those but all my primaries. So far so good off the dome I'm remembering pretty much all of them but I never remember my ICQ number. It's in one of my forum profiles but .. let's just say I'm a member to many many forums and now I have to try to figure out which one is so old I was at the time still putting in every single contact option I had.

If any of you have a preference for IM clients that I should be aware of please let me know.

P.S. I recall having a client that had a LJ plugin.. I'm 60% sure that wasn't a dream but I can't think of what I would have been using.

P.S.S. seeing it available at Digsby prompted me to sign up for linkedin account. I found an e-mail a friend sent me about a year and a half ago and surprise surprise the 'expired invitation' still worked. who'd have thought ehh?"

"event","Anger does terrible terrible things to me. I never engage in anger for long but I still feel like my body is about to go into seizure. It's a good things I trust myself and I or this would be a very different type of entry.

I am going to reconsider starting a whole other twitter account just to log the inane things I tolerate. I think if everyone realized the futility of the tasks they constantly assign me coupled with the personal tasks I wish to accomplish they might cut me some slack. You know what? I'd settle for someone who realized that when I say ""I understand"" I'm not just saying it and I really do completely and totally comprehend.

I despise tension. When I was designing my personality I made sure the parameter of minimal tension was a very high priority. If people would just listen to me and do what I say I wouldn't have every side of my family pissed at me (or at each other). Seriously if I give you a message then bloody convey it. Don't think you know what the message is and just ignore my request. I know what you're thinking and a) you're wrong and b) rather than explain to you the reality of the situation I simply code the message so that the receiver will understand even if you don't. If they stopped getting pissed at me and explaining things to me that I already know again and again and again and again in the same excruciatingly unnecessary detail maybe now I wouldn't be feeling my blood pulse thru my ears.

It's actually a bit scary, my body is quaking so much I can't think straight enough to read. I can't put into words how much that feeds my anger. I was really looking forward to reading tonight. There's nothing I love more than reading, and tonight that has been taken from me."

I'm interested in seeing what's new with Flash CS4. I don't know when it happened but suddenly everything is in Flash Player 10. Maybe it's something I was interested in learning.  bah.

I was just reminded that tomorrow big deal outta towners are coming to church so I'm sure people are going to expect me to be there as well and early to do tech support and take pictures. Even it they didn't start at the same times. There's no way I'm gonna make it out of church on the dial in time for the second half.

What a bloody mess. The euphoric rush I got form solving my floating objects clearing issues on the website must have clouded my judgment. Now I'm back to being pulled by 4 influences at once.

I should have picked up AfroSamurai from the library today. Finding Brisingr just doesn't make up for this mess by itself.

P.S. Interesting note my youngest nephew has endurance like you wouldn't believe he cries (literally) over pretty much anything that doesn't go his way and he can keep that up for longer than I'd think. He had to have a bath and I heard him crying for like 10-13 minutes straight."

Teaching myself CSS shouldn't be this hard but there are so many conflicts with what I'm seeing, and what I'm reading. For instance:
<body bgcolor=""#3888bc"" leftmargin=""0"" topmargin=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"">

I'm pretty sure the <a href=""http://ping.fm/JycWE'>body tag</a> isn't supposed to have a margin attribute at all. Even if it did from what I can tell that's something that should have been deprecated long ago."

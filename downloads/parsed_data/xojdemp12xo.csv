Lenny paid some psycic lady to read these cards to us.. it was crazy!! She basically new what was going on in my life aND told me how i was acting towards people (especially adrian) ..PSYCHO.. so we went and chilled back at biagi's house and w/e the parents were drunk off their ass's it was hilarious. we all had a good time! took adrian home and got home around 1:30... --sunday--mother's day--biagi and coco's bday-- went to the houghtalings fro lunch came home around 7 laid in bed and guess what.. adrian came over and surprised me.. ofcourse he brought my mom a strawberry cheesecake heart pie..she loved it! he chilled here till like 11 and went home.. Today well it was basically just a normal school day not much interesting happened.. Me and Mari started our gift for the girls and then adrian came over.. Well thats about it imma go..

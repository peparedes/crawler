So now I'm back on the LJ.

And I'm bored, and surely and I don't want to do anything any more. No more looking for jobs if you please. No more writing. No more working on ""I don't matter, you don't matter: A child's book of existentialist thought and theory"" or ""Thar She Blows"" or any of my other pet projects. 

Sometimes I get so fed up with being me, but I'm sure everyone knows how that goes."

"event","It's Christmas, and I'm just going to get fat, and that's just the way that it's going to be again this year! On the table in front of me there's a bag of raisons, a cube of butter in a plastic sandwhich bag and 3 packages of peanuts, pecans and walnuts. Everywhere I turn in this house there's a plate of cookies, or a stack of cake slices or a glass of egg-nog. At school they keep holding holiday pot-lucks in the teachers loung and every friday they bring in a torte or a chocolate covered something or other. I can feel the layers of loveable fat folding over my sides everymorening when I wake up. Still, Christmas is just that magical time of year when I subsist on a diet of fruitcake and egg-nog. And that's the way it is.

But really the best thing about Christmas is the way it changes the school environment. THis past week I've been subbing mostly for first graders and second graders, and they all have special Christmas work to do this time of year. There are Christmas decorations  to be hung, Christmas presents to make, Christmas games to play. Everyone is using red and green and trying to find or make or draw a new home for rudolph. Everyone is thinking about what they want and (thank you to the teachers who want to instill good values) thinking about how they've earned it this past year. 
It's got me to thinking back on all of my Christmas memories, and school memories in general. I remember being seven or eight and living in a small community like the one where I live now, and making jack o' lantern tostadas in the fourth grade. We went into this room where the teachers had set up a table of tortillas and beans and lettuce and tomatoes and sour creame, and each of us kids took a tortilla and a small plastic knife and cut eyes and noses and mouths into the big white flour tortilla's. THen we covered them with all of the fixings and ate. This was Halloween, of course. At Christmas we brought in cookies and punch and sometimes we did a gift exchange. The school was a lot like the one where I'm working now. It was made up of both buildings and mobile homes where they needed to expand after the main part had already been constructed. There was a lot of natural setting and a lot of rurral surrounding and I guesse a lot of kids with emotional problems and lousy home lives. I remember one year, I guess it was right before Christmas, there was a fire in the community. I was in fourth grade and I didn't pay much attention to those kinds of things, but the fire had been at the home of one of my classmates. He was a new boy and I didn't know him very well, but that fire had killed him. On the day of our party my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Sickoura, pointed to the table of goodies and told us that one of the trays of cookies had been brought in days before by the new boy, and that we should have a moment of silence and remember him before eating what he had brought. If I remember correctly, the new boy had lived in a mobile home and he had died because, after having been rescued himself, he had gone back inside to save his little brother. 

That was fourth grade. I don't remember anything very specific about Christmas at school again until high school. By then we were all much older and I don't think anyone made much fuss about Christmas, except for my Drama Teacher, Ms. Ianessa. It was her tradition, every year, to stop work in her Advanced Drama class, and read to us Truman Capote's A Christmas Memory. 
It began Freshman year, when I was thirteen, and I didn't much like the story. In case you haven't read it, it's about a little boy who lives with his extended family and has no friends except for this very old woman who is a cousin once removed or something  like that. The old woman calls him buddy, because he reminds her of someone she knew when she was little, who was also called buddy. The woman is getting on in years and doesn't quite have all of her wits about her, and the little boy is her only real companion because nobody else in the family really cares about her or about him, so they've both been kind of pushed aside and left to care for one another. One morning she wakes up and says ""oh my, it's fruitcake weather."" And the two of them set off to buy all the things they need. They've been saving up pennies and dimes all year just so they can have enough to buy dried fruit, and nuts and flour and sugar and butter and just the tinniest bit of rum for their cakes. During the summer they killed flies, and the family members who don't care much about them, pay these two outsider, the boy and the old woman a penny for a hundred dead flies. So on the back of dead flies, they have enough to make fruitcake, and the search for all of the things they need leads them into all kinds of adventures. THey have to go into the woods to a bar to get the rum that they need, and then the rest of the family gets into an uproar because they catch the old woman with rum in front of the boy, and the whole lot of them scold her in front of the kid, and they both end up crying about it late into the night. Then they send the fruitcakes off to strangers and celebrities and, as they do every year, to the President and the First Lady. 
I think I didn't like the story at first because it was just too old, and simple, and a little sad. My Drama Teacher was young and spry and had very thick curly black hair that she kept short. I haven't thought about her in a long time it seems, but she was my favorite teacher in high school. I used to go to her for advice, freely, like I would to any of my friends, and I always felt, when I talked to her, that I was being treated as an adult. She really knew a lot about stuff that mattered in life, like how to get along with others, and how to work effectively in a group to get something done. I spent four whole years with her in Advanced Drama Class and in rehersals for the after school shows. Some people really hated her because she could be a task-master. I understood that she was just had high expectations and that maybe she was just a touch neurotic about getting a show to run smoothly. Most of the students, the ones in Advanced Drama especially, appreciated her dedication and kept in touch with her after graduation. 
In my junior year she cast me as Lady Macbeth in the Shakespeare Festival. My senior year she gave me the part of Ouiser Boudreaux in Steel Magnolias. It was a small show, and a really big last hurrah for all of us I think. After the show was over, on the last Friday before we left for Christmas Vacation, she gathered us together again, as always, to read Truman Capote's story. The room where we held Drama Class was called the Black Box Theater, because it looked just like a black box on the inside. Black walls, black doors, black ceiling, a long grey counter top under a long silver mirror lined with lights, like the kind you see in the backstage dressing rooms of all theaters. We sat on risers usually, but on that last Friday of my last year, we sat wherever we pleased, on the risers, on the floor, on the little elevated stage at the center of the room. We looked like a litter of kittens all spread out and squished in between the corners of the room. All of us brightly colored high school students in a grey little box. Ms. I. sat in a corner of the room on a big black box, and held the book open with her thumb and index finger, the rest of her slanting forward into the room. She looked a little like a student herself, with legs crossed and shoulders hunched towards the pages of the book. Her voice was powerful and slow, and she read with great feeling. 
About the part where the story begins to wind down, when the fruitcake has been made and wrapped and sent off, her voice became soft and heavy. This was the part that happened every year, had been happening every year since I had been a freshman. The part where the boys family decides that he's too much of an inconvenience to have around, so after Christmas they simply ship him off to boarding school. The old woman gets older and older. She writes to him and he writes to her, but more and more she begins to get confused, and she confuses him with the other buddy, the one she knew when she was a kid. 
It's about this time that I look around and realize that this is my last Christmas in this room, that this is my last Christmas with Ms. I, and the rest of the Advanced Drama Students, that this is my last Christmas of Truman Capote and fruitcake weather, my last Christmas with the old woman and the boy, and as I thought about this, looking around at all of us sprawled on the floor like a basket full of kittens, I  think it really hit home for the first time, that things were coming to an end. I began to sob, a shallow, confused kind of weeping, that was more than sorrow or regret, but also a celebration of everything that had come before. All of those many years of working in that room, and rehearsing for plays, making friends, losing friends, reading Faust, writing in our reflection journals, and spending one day out of every year, regular as clockwork, sprawled on a floor, listening to a short haired spry little Italian teacher reading to us her favorite story, A Christmas Memory.

One Last Thing About Christmas:
Last year I was in Washington D.C. up until three days before Christmas. It was an unexpected visit that had wound up lasting three months. Originally I had been planning to move to New orleans, but then New Orleans had been hit by Hurricane Katrina and I took my savings (back in the day when I had savings) and moved to Washington D.C. instead. It was my first Christmas away from California and when December rolled around I thought I had never seen the season come to life to the extent that it came alive in that City. Everywhere you went the streets were lined with white lights. The black iron gates across from the white house, shops, the residential areas were all trimmed with bulbs of white and wreaths of green and big red bows trimmed in gold. Along the streets the fancy hotels hung Christmas ornaments from their high overhangs, dangling them down on pieces of translucent twine, with crowds of people in thick wool overcoats huddled together underneath. The big marble white of the Capitol and the Memorials and the National Archive Buildings took on a new lustre, and in the coffee shop where once I had worked there was always Christmas Music playing. One day I woke up and there was snow. The whole National Mall was a winter wonderland of black and white under the red and gold. I had never been to such an enchanted place, and I wasn't really looking forward to leaving.
The night before I left, it was a weekday I think, I got myself a cup of coffee and walked down past the White House towards the Lincoln Memorial and starred out at the frozen pond, listening to the sound of the ducks and geese quacking to each other on the other side of the water. 
Then I walked down past the National Monument, and crossed the street to where the Christmas Tree was lit up in front of the White House. Now in Washington D.C. there are two big Christmas Trees. One is in front of the Capitol Building and the other is in front of the White House, but it's not just a Christmas Tree, it's a Christmas maze. A Christmas Mandala on the lawn in the center of the city. In the center is the Christmas Tree, the big Christmas tree with all of it's lights and ornaments, and around it are 49 other little trees, each one representing a state in the Union. When I went to see these trees there was a chorus of school children singing Christmas Carols on a little stage that borders the street. They were just finishing up when I arrived and their parents and neighbors and teachers made quite a little torrent of gloves and hats as they milled out on the way out to their cars. But a few lingered on to look around and I felt that maybe we were all kind of there together, as a large family looking at these things, and feeling all toasty in our hearts as we walked around in the cold. In the corner there was a fire pit, and people would stop next to this to warm their hands. The pit was big and deep and every now and then a man on a tractor would use big yellow claws of his machine to pick up a log and dump it onto the fire. When he did this the sparks would shoot up into the air like fireworks and everyone would ooo and awww and hold their hands out again to get warm.
As I said, this was my first Christmas away from California, and while I wasn't in a big hurry to get back, I was still a little  nostalgic for home. So after spending an evening's reverie in front of the fire I started making my way around the circle of smaller trees, looking for the California Christmas Tree. From where I started out there was a long way to go to get to California. I had to go by most of the other states first, looking at all of their ornaments and decorations. Alongside each tree was a little marker telling you where the ornaments had come from and who had made them. Most of them came from public institutions such as Children's hospitals or museums or schools. All of the ornaments had been made by Children and you could tell which ones had been really MADE and which ones had merely been assembled, with some strict adult looking over them to make sure that all the parts were in the right place and all the pieces were in the right order and that nobody used too much glue. Trees from these states were very precise and uniform and all of the ornaments looked the same. Other trees from other states looked just like a child's coloring book, with red and green drawn outside of the lines and puffs of cotton-snow hastily glued all over this and that, all tangled up iside of little clear plastic balls, hanging from the branches. I imagined all of these little kids getting ready for the holidays in their classes, or wherever they were, and really concentrating on where they were going to put that bit of plastic packaging and this little cardboard cut out of Santa. And then I imagined all the others, the ones from the uniform states, trying very hard to follow directions precisely, and I imagined that in most cases some adult had to come around and help them pull things apart and put them back together again in the correct way, so that everything would look perfect.
After all of this wandering and imagining I finally came to the tree for the state of Louisiana. Katrina had hit only a few months before and I wondered how the state's Christmas was going down there in the South, so many states away. I looked at the little tree, amidst it's brothers and sisters along the little circular walkway and read the plackard, which said ""Due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans Public School was not able to make their usual decorations. This year, each state in the nation has contributed an ornament so that Lousianna's Tree can still stand proud.""

And that, my friends, is Christmas."

"event","Spending too much time around the children of lower-end communities can be so depressing. For the past few weeks I've been substitute teaching in Anza, a little desert town where people have parked trailers and mobile homes under the picturesque blue hills of Southern California. It's a beautiful place full of ribbon wood trees and wild cacti and the most amazing sunsets and sunrises you ever did see. If you wanted to you could spend a week communing with nature without ever being disturbed by your neighbors. Sometimes I'm surprised that there are enough children to fill a school. But there are, and so I've been teaching at the elementary/junior high, which is a 10 minute drive from the house, and what I've found there is, quite frankly, repugnant. Utterly disgusting. 
There is no discipline. The classrooms are overcrowded and in some instances there aren't enough full time teachers to take over all of the available positions. And the children can and do get away with murder. It's pretty normal to encounter ""behavior problems"" often enough, but the kind of things that go on here are beyond the norm. Kids throw things at one another without rebuke, they talk over the teachers and other students, they refuse to do their work (not the passive agressive sitting in their seats and not doing the work, but flat out refusing to do it.) Today a student was given a test and ripped it in two, then got up and left the class. The level of non-compliance is amazing, but that's hardly what's so disturbing. Children are children and they're bound to act up once in a while, everyone does. Everyone from the model-citizen to the future drop-out. THat's just the way kids are (and adults too for that matter.) But what's really upsetting is what you learn aobu their histories when a kid does act up. It's not just them, it's usually something to do with their parents. In the past few weeks I've learned the hard way that too many parents up here are child abusers, alcoholics and drug-addicts. In some cases they're just lousy parents.

"event","Okay, so I'm still substitute teaching in the public schools of California and every day the little pricks complain that they don't want to do their work, and they don't want to sit down and they don't want to shut up and they don't want to go to their next class and they basically don't want to get an education. So I come in, and get all kinds of frustrated and every once in a while I make my ""You're all so lucky to be here and to have this opportunity and therefore because you are so lucky you should all sit down and start licking the metaphoric asshole of the state with a profound sense of gratitude for all that it is currently about to give to you."" 

But after some careful consideration I have decided that this is a foolish standpoint. The idea of a teacher coming in and telling students to be grateful for their education is like a Nazi coming in to a concentration camp and telling the Jews, Homosexuals and Gypsies, that they should all be soooo grateful for the little piece of bread they get each day before being sent to do heavy lifting. I mean, HELLO MR. NAZI! We didn't ASK to be put into this concentration camp! And analogously, no student ASKS to be born. No student ASKS to come into a body that requires food for survival, a body that feels pain when it is hungry, a body that feels pain when it's hot or cold, a land that does not always yield enough food, a culture that requires an education of it's citizens. Forgetting just the part about the body feeling pain, an individual does not design the rules by which society operates! Students did not invent language or history or math so why should they feel grateful for the opportunity to learn it? Maybe what a student wants is to live as the first people lived. I think what students really want is to live like cave people. THey want to wake up in the woods, stretch, look at the sun, and spend the rest of the day fucking and killing things. That's what society should be. THat's what we should really be doing with these bodies, fucking and killing things and maybe, just maybe learning how to make fire. The wheel might be pushing it. 

And that's what they want, but that's not what they get and it's not their fault. So why should they feel grateful that someone like me is there to come in and teach them language and history and mathematics? No real reason at all, unless they've already accepted that this is the world into which they've been born and there's no use fighting anymore. But it takes a long time for people to realize that. And it might be a better world if they never did."

"event","So I've been thinking, we really don't have much of a choice about being human. What I mean is that we never really chose to be human, we never really acknowledge what it is to be human either, not directly. When we're babies we don't know who we are, we don't even distinguish between ourselves and our mothers' breasts. Human beings don't develope a sense of self until they're two years old. Think about that, by the time we've figured out that we're human beings we've been living the life of human beings for a whole two years automatically. It's just natural that we go on living the life of human existence sort of unquestioningly for a while, eating, breathing, sleeping and what not because it's all we know. THe concept of something else hasn't yet occured. And if it does occur it's still too late. We've been living automatically for so long by that time we're apt to continue on just out of habit, without really taking the time to ask ""do I chose this? Why would I chose this? Would I really like to be human, or would I prefere to be, say, a Ferarri convertable in candy apple red, driving down a freeway in Los Angeles? What about a horse, or a dragon? I want to be an eagle, but I don't have that option apparently."" Anyway, I'm not sure where I'm going with this, I hadn't thought about that before I started writing it. And now i'm continuing the writing just out of habit. 
O look at that, an open refrigerator. I think I'll go fill the empty void in my head with food. 
You know, some people think it's sad that people have to use food to fill an empty void. But those people are pessimists who think the glass is half empty. An optomist would just be grateful that there was something near by to fill the void.
I'm an optomist."

"event","Today I wrestled through a whirlwind of inner conflicts brought on by a high school assigment.
Picture it, Elsinore High School, early October, a small classroom on the second floor, the walls plastered with pictures of Lincoln and propaganda from the 1950's. I am given the task of teaching A.P. Government, playing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and finishing up with only one period of the dreaded mandatory U.S. History class. (A.P. classes are a treat because they're usually well behaved. Mandatory classes are full of students resentful to be asked to sit in a classroom when they'd rather be doing anything else.) 
I make the mistake of watching both the A.P. Gov class and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with optomistic enthusiasm. Both are inspiring, the class because it's full of students who are actually working, engaging with the material, discussing the issues, and making progress in their education. The movie because it recognizes the corruption in the government but points to the power of the pure hearted and idealistic to change the corruption and bring goodness and honesty back into the nation. I can't explain either experience with justice, but let's say that by the end of the day my heart was brimming with hope and love and my eyes were shining like a naive little school girl's. America is good. Democracy is good. People have worked long and hard, made sacrifices, given their time, their money, every material good, and even their lives to ensure our freedom and our opportunities. 
Then the second to last bell rang and the last class of the day piled in. 
Actually, they lingered outside the door until AFTER the tardy bell had rung and THEN they came in, jumping and running and yelling at one another across the room. 
(This doesn't bother me. They always act that way after lunch.)
And As soon as I got through role call this one shrill voice rings out in the back corner whining ""I wanna go home."" It's the voice of a very skinny, very nicely dressed black girl.
I puase a moment. Look at her. ""So go."" I say.
She barely looks at me. ""No. Nevermind."" But it's not a yielding nevermind. It's the ""I'm going to suck it up and play your game even though I really and truly hate you, nevermind.""
So I continue on. I know I shouldn't. I know from experience that I shouldn't. I know from all the classes before and all the studies of the teenage mind and all the fiber in my being that I shouldn't, but I do. I continue on. 
""You know,"" I say, ""Not everyone gets to go to school. Most people your age, in most places around the world, spend their days working in the sun, living in squalor, going to bed in their own sewage.""
""That's not our fault."" Another voice says. This time it's a white male with piercings the size of tin cans in his ear lobes. And the way he says it makes me think of Nazis, how they trained themselves never to feel anything so that they could go on killing Jews without remorse. This boy has nothing in his face but hate.
Indifference would be an improvement.
So I say ""fine"" pass out the worksheets, put on the movie, and move to the back of the room where I can quietly brood in the darkness.

Maybe it's not worth it. I think. Maybe Democracy is a mistake. I think. Maybe equality is a mistake. Maybe some people really are meant to flip burgers all of their lives. Maybe some people are meant to work out in the fields and die of easily preventable diseases. Maybe these students, just as an example, should be out doing manual labor instead of sitting in here wasting my time and the tax dollars of millions of hard working Americans.
Not to play the race issue, but I think of the girl specifically. Now there's someone with three strikes against her. She's a girl. She's African American. She's young. 300 years ago she would be living in a hut without running water, getting whipped and raped and spending all day picking my cotton. Now, she's here in a classroom, with me as a temporary teacher. I'm getting paid, by someone else, to teach her things that she would have been forbidden to learn a few short centuries ago. 
And there were people who put her here. There were people who laid down their lives so that she could be here. I think of those early slaves who made their way to the North. I think of Fredrick Douglas, brilliant, dilligently writing his account of slavery. I think of Lincoln and the risk he took in the emancipation proclomation. I think of Susan B. Anthony going to jail for women. I think of every member of every social movement from the early abolitionists to the civil rights movement, and how they have all sacrificed everything so that this girl can sit here with an equal opportunity (a privileged opportunity in comparrison to the children of third world countries), and whine - WHINE - that she doesn't want it. For all of those years they worked and worked and dreamed and hoped against hope and one against almost insurmountable odds, so that this shrill voiced girl could throw it all back in their faces.
And the boy, he is too much the quintessence of white privilege. He puts a face to everything the opressed have a right to condemn.
And so I wonder, why did we even bother building a civilization when the people for whom it was built won't even take care to appreciate it.

We should have let them all continue suffering in the heat of the Southern Sun. Not just the slaves, but the girls, the poor, the children. All the white kids in the class might have wound up in bottle factories, working for pennies and getting wounded in bad equipment. Maybe they deserved it. Maybe Democracy doesn't do anyone any good at all.

I come home wanting to forget it all. I want to forget about politics and teenagers and ethics and hope and everything. I turn on Northern Exposure and there, on the screen, is the next episode in the line of episodes I haven't watched. It's entitled ""Democracy in America.""

Oh Northern Exposure, have you forsaken me as well? You were my comfort, my solice, my home away from any form of stable home. And yet I love you still. So I'll play this episode, because that's what you do with someone you love. You listen to them, even when you're not in the mood.

I played the episode and my faith not in vain! Oh No! For there, on the screen, in the story, eminating from the mouths of the characters, were THE ANSWERS! Yes, THE ANSWERS! 
Picture it, Cicely (Alaska) 199?, the small town of Cicely is rocked when an election for mayor divides people along political lines. Chris, the disc jockey (who could more acurately be described as a mystic and spiritual seeker) gets on the air to extole the virtues of voting and the glory of Democracy itself. While for Ed, a teenager on the brink of manhood, this election is his first ever experience with political participation. He takes it very seriously and begins asking the big questions about Democracy. Finally he stopps Chris on the street and whips out a book with highlighted passages from, (And this is what endears the show to my heart)De Toqueville (one of my favorite political theorists) and a couple other people I didn't know about until college. All of the passages are contradictions to one another and Ed looks at Chris and asks ""Which one of them is right?""
Chris pauses and says ""They all are."" 
""Then who should I vote for?""
""It doesn't matter."" Chris says. ""It's the voting itself that matters. In voting we are achieving democracy.""

And this reminds me of something that Simone De Beauvoire wrote in The Ethics of Ambiguity. She says that when we reject something we achieve freedom absolutely. There is no ambiguity about rejection. Rejection is an absolute. But when we aim at something we are bound to come against conflicts and contradictions and ambiguities. When we say we want freedom do we mean freedom for everyone at all times? What about murder? Should that be free? What about the murdered? Are they free? There is bound to be an ethical choice that will limit freedom for the sake of freedom. It's not an absolute. 

It was the answer that I was looking for, and in fact the only answer that is fitting. 

Does Democracy Matter? Is it useful? Is it wasted?
Yes and no. For those A.P. kids it was not wasted. Everyone who fought and died to achieve a school for those kids would have been proud to see children of all races and economic backgrounds reading and writing and debating as equals. Was it wasted on the regular U.S. History class? Maybe. Who knows, time may tell otherwise. I don't know. But it makes me think of something I once read in Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy:

Socrates is the prototype of the theoretical optimist who with his belief in the explicability of the nature of things, attributes to knowledge and perception the power of a universal panacea . . . But now science, stimulated by its powerful illusion, hastens irresistibly to its limits, on which its optimism, hidden in the essence of logic, is wrecked. For the periphery of the circle of science has an infinite number of points, and while there is still no telling how this circle can ever be completely measured, yet the noble and gifted man, even before the middle of his career, inevitably comes in contact with those extreme points of the periphery where he stares into the unfathomable. When to his dismay he here sees how logic coils round itself at these limits and finally bites its own tail - then the new form of perception rises to view, namely tragic perception, which, in order even to be endured, requires art as protection and remedy.

I feel as though I have been on my own journey through the evolution of consciousness as Nietzsche described it. I began the day thinking about reason and goodness. I believed that reason was an absolute and that using logic I could make teenagers and everyone else in the world see the logic of goodness. But I came to the peripheries of logic. I saw that logic has its bounds and that not all logic constitutes an absolute. There are some places where even gravity does not apply, and so logic too is limited. I looked at a principle, Democracy, and I tried to make it encompass the whole world, but when I saw that it had it's limits, I turned around and came sulking back into the center of the world. Here I found the particular. I found Northern Exposure. I found art. THe world became small enough to see again, small enough for the mortal eye, concrete enough for a more concrete judgment. Is Democracy good for the whole world? I do not know? Is it good for me? That I can more accurately judge. Is it good for the people of Cicely Alaska? That I can more accurately see. And so, in looking for answers I and in finding them where I did, I have fulfilled Nietzsche's prophecy. I found that in the light of tragic perception it was not reason but art that became my protection and remedy."

"event","Well Friends it turns out that the rugged individualism propagated by the American Ideology has a downside in that it has vastly decreased the strength of the community in modern culture. It used to be that people depended upon one another extensively for the basic necessities, food, shelter, warmth. In medieval times the whole village would come together to make a loaf of bread, the members of a community knew each other intimately and few people went to bed alone in a house. Now you can live isolated in the comfort of your own money, buy what you need from vendors who do not know your name, and live single until the day you die. 
Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? Does it make us more self-reliant? More self-centered?  More alienated from one another? More hostile towards our fellow human beings? More anxious about our ability to survive? I don't know. 
Recently I've been watching a lot of episodes of Northern Exposure. For those of you who don't know, Northern Exposure was a TV series in the 90's about a New York City Doctor who moved to Alaska to practice medicine in a small town full of eccentric characters. Sitting alone in the house watching characters getting to know one another, learning to co-exist and co-evolve together, learning to help each other, and learning to come to terms with life in general together has made me realize the importance of community in the life of the individual. It's made me realize how much I miss having a community now that I've graduated from college and flung myself out into the cold semi-urban world of Southern California, where I find myself living emotionally independent and isolated from everything I used to love.
So to that end, I am joining Live Journal.
Cheesy, sappy, silly as my motives may be, I hope it will help foster a sense of communal connection with the bigger world outside of myself."

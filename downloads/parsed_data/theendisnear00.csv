""Save Me From Me""

If you only knew the pain
The pain I keep inside
The pain that makes me ""me""
Then without it who am I
In a room with broken walls
I lay in scene and dreams
I want you to see

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

And I'm losing my will
Just to hold you in
I'm giving up the hope
That you could have been the one
To save me from me
And now our lips will meet 
and i'll taste their defeat
I'll give in this once

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

Still I know I'll carry on
Guide me through the life I lost
To find these faults in me...
To find these faults in me

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breath for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

To save me from me

I LOVE YOU ALL <3

i will never forget any of you.

BRANDON I STILL LOVE YOU   lol





Sarah McLachlan  I Will Remeber You 

I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories 
Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me
I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside
But we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you
But more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness
Deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had
Oh you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

And I will remember you 
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Weep not for the memories

""Right Here""

I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending it's as much as i can take
and you're so independent
you just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break

But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting

I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you

Why can't you just forgive me
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way
But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away would you be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting"

Broken home, all alone (x2)

I can't seem to fight these feelings
I'm caught in the middle of this
And my wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
I wish I had someone to talk to, someone I could confide in
I just want to know the truth, I just want to know the truth
Want to know the truth ...

Broken home, all alone

I know my mother loves me
But does my father even care if I'm sad or angry?
You were never ever there when I needed you
I hope you regret what you did
I think I know the truth, your father did the same to you
Did the same to you ...

I'm crying day and night now
What is wrong with me?
I cannot fight now, I feel like a weak link
Crying day and night now
What is wrong with me? I cannot fight now, I feel like a weak link

Push it back ... inside
Push it back ... inside
(A weak link)
Push it back ... inside
Push it back ... INSIDE!

Broken home, all alone

It feels bad to be alone
Crying by yourself, living in a broken home
How could I tell it so all y'all could feel it?
Depression strikes hard like my old earth would tell it
To me, her son, she told me I'm the one
Pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
Stories that I tell are non-fiction
And you can take it back cause it's already done

BROKEN HOME!!!!! (x2)

""Swing Life Away""

Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move
The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon
Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand....until you hold my hand

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

""The Razor""


This is television, late night television, scripted with precision
A corner store pulp fiction sits where your heart isn't
And with your eyes so green, and your pinkish theme
You made an old friend seem rather dead to me
Alas, the weapon sex can be

Your body is a weapon and you're afraid it could get out
A friend of the devil and you're afraid it could get out

Don't say i don't cut when i do, i do, i do
Don't say i'm lying when i'm true, i'm true, i'm true
The razor

You rub of suspicious, so vile and aniscious, with a heart so vicious
And dare you ask what this is, this is so delicious
To eat the best of you like the others do 
We take your pride from you
The drive-in, the embassy, the jets, it's all the same to me

Your body is a weapon and you're afraid it could get out
A friend of the devil and you're afraid it could get out

Don't say i don't cut when i do, i do, i do
Don't say i'm lying when i'm true, i'm true, i'm true
The razor (the razor)
Don't say we're healing when it's just not what we do

So many suitors, i don't even have a suit to wear
So many influential fingers running through your hair
I am the razor in the hands of your heart
And i am the razor in the hands of god

Don't say i don't cut when i do, i do, i do (i do, i do)
Don't say i'm lying when i'm true, i'm true, i'm true (i do,i do)
The razor (the razor)
Don't say we're healing when it's just not what we do (the razor)
Don't say we're healing when it's just not what we do (the razor)
Don't say we're healing when it's just not what we do

No one ever thought this one would survive
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind
Lock you in a dream, never let you go
Never let you laugh or smile, not you.

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.

Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up.
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday.

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart,
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart ... yeah!

You know that life really takes its toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much damn confusion before my eyes,
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives.

I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart,
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart.
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart.

Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal 
And you never had a chance 
Love it, or leave it, you can't understand 
A pretty face, but you do so carry on, 
and on, 
and on 

I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me 
I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on, 
and on, 
and on, 
and on 
Love is the red of the rose on your coffin door 
What's life like, bleeding on the floor, 
the floor, 
the floor 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
Give me a reason to believe 

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

Preach all you want but who's gonna save me? 
I keep a gun on the book you gave me, hallelujah, lock and load 
Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent son 
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one,
and one, 
and one, 
and one 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
Give me a reason to believe 

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will 

You'll never make me leave 
I wear this on my sleeve 
You wanna follow something 
Give me a better cause to lead 
Just give me what I need 
Give me a reason to believe 

[Chorus x2]
So give me all your poison 
And give me all your pills 
And give me all your hopeless hearts 
And make me ill 
You're running after something 
That you'll never kill 
If this is what you want 
Then fire at will



wow its amazing what people will do to get your attention. when i block some one..... it means i dont want to talk to them...... it doesnt mean i want you to make another s/n to talk to me on! thats so frustrating!                                                                       i dont even know if i spelled that right!!!!!!

Hey there,
I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all.
Where you are and how you feel.
With these lights off as these wheels
keep rolling on and on. (and on and on and on...)
Slow things down or speed them up.
Not enough or way too much. (and on and on and on...)
How are you when I'm gone?

[Chorus:]
And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

Spare me just three last words.
""I love you"" is all she heard.
I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever.
[x2]

[Chorus:]
And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

(YOU...KILL...ME...WELL!!!)
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
My final breath is gone 
So I can fall asleep tonight

[Chorus:]
And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.
So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

Getting a little erratic here
And I don't know who to trust
I guess they got a way of reading my mind
I guess I got to adjust
I got my arms that flip flop flip flop flip
I got my head on a spring
Well I thought I got you on my side
I haven't got fucking anything

I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even trying to stand out

I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I have nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away

Can kind of see out the cracks
When I press up to the wall
I'm not looking to stand up real high
I'd be happy to crawl
I think I'm losing my grip
But I can still make a fist
You know I still got my one good arm
That I can beat, I can beat myself up with

I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even trying to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I have nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away

Hey and for what it is worth
I really used to believe
That maybe there's some great thing
That we could achieve
And now I can't tell the difference
Or know what to feel
Between what I've been trying so hard to see
And what appears to be real

My world is getting smaller every day
Hey hey hey hey
And that's ok




Well my trip wasnt how i wanted it to be. There was NOT ONE person my age there to talk to. This creapy 13 year old guy named eddie was hitting on me at the warter park and couldnt think of something to say or a way to introduce him self so he came up to me and said ""Hi whats your name....."" ""my dad bet me i couldnt get a girl to talk to me and when i saw you i said well maybe she will be worth the while, cause your hot"". HOW CREAPY!!!???!!??!?!?!?

Rest in peace girl, your death is such a shame
The paper said a bullet got in your way
But I smell foul play, possible poisoning
I had to bring you in for questioning
I went to your grave, dug up your body
Brought it to my house, where you lay

So let's play doctor babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
For me...

I headed downtown, to share what I had found
It's not a suicide, it's a crime
I have a witness, it's clearly evident
There had to be someone else present
At the time of death, poisons in stomach
How could she pull it, if she's dead?

So let's play doctor babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
We need a scalpel now
Under white lights you lay
We've got to hurry up
Before the flesh decays
Away...away

I'll catch the murderer
And send him away
I'll get the evidence
From your last day

Your last day...

So let's play doctor babe

Sometimes
I wish I was brave
I wish I was stronger
I wish I could feel no pain
I wish I was young
I wish I would try
I wish I was honest
I wish I was you not I

'Cause
I feel so mad
I feel so angry
I feel so callous
So lost, confused again
I feel so cheap
So used, unfaithful
Let's start over
Let's start over

Sometimes
I wish I was smart
I wish I made cures for
How people are
I wish I had power
I wish I could leave
I wish I could change the world
For you and me

'Cause
I feel so mad
I feel so angry
I feel so callous
So lost, confused again
I feel so cheap
So used, unfaithful

Right! Now ha, ha,
I am an antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passerby

'Cause I wanna be Anarchy
No dogs body

Anarchy for the UK
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I wanna be Anarchy
In the city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best
I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use Anarchy

'Cause I wanna be Anarchy
It's the only way to be

Is this the M.P.L.A or
Is this the U.D.A or
Is this the I.R.A
I thought it was the UK
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

I Wanna be Anarchy
I Wanna be Anarchy
Oh what a name

I wanna be Anarchy
Know what I mean?

And I wanna be an anarchist
Get pissed
Destroy!

"event","Wow jon that was one heck of a convo we had. I think it did a lot of good what do you think. I am VERRY IMPRESSED wiht a lot of the answers you gave me.
Wanna know how i got the song of the day....... cause im obsessed wiht eminem and was looking at his lyrics. here are the lyrics to this song. (the song id from the movie 8 mile. IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!!!! ""8 Mile Freestyle vs ""Lickty Spilt""""

[Lickety Split]

This guy's a choke artist
Ya catch a bad one
Your better off shootin yourself
With Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Ill leave you lost without a paddle
Floatin shits creek

You ain't Detroit, Im the D
Your the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music

Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin foolish 
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack
And when you actin up thats when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

Ill crack your shoulder blade
Youll get dropped so hard 
Elvis will start turnin in his grave
I dont know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park

[Rabbit]

This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
Its all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So Im a German, Eh
Thats ok, you look like a fuckin worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies

Talkin bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek 
With paddles this deep
Your still gonna sink
Your a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race

He can't get with me spittin this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Spickety spickety split lickety
So Im gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!


okay i think im out for right now cause its like 12:58 am sunday morning."

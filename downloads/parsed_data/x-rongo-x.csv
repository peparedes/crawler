It's not really summer yet for me, in fact I'm kind of feeling stressed out with this quartet practice, and commencements coming up.

I'm pretty sure after Sunday, I'll be stress free, and finally in the summer mood, I can't wait!"

Today after school, I went out and tanned for an hour....ummm, I didnt use the little bit of sunscreen I should have...I burned on my chest...and it somewhat hurts, that's the last time I make that mistake...it's kind of funny thought.


Also, I had some very easy exams today, it's been a sweet year."

"event","Yesterday I got surprised by all my friends with a party, for my going away...so I guess it could be called a going away party...or rather a surprise party? yeah..

It was pretty sweet, and I was pretty surprised, and of course, unaware that it was going to happen, all of my good friends showed up, and it definitely was one of the best days ever.

Then my band had a show in Saganasty, at jamestowne hall..however our guitarrist's car broke down, and our drummer couldn't make it. We decided to play anyways, witht he band manager, Richard, and we made up a huge blues jam set, rather than playing ska, it was REALLY sweet, I had a good time."

I found out I did pretty well on my chem test...which I wasn't expecting.

In seminar, I recieved my pictures from Choral Festival

They spelled my name wrong, it ended up being Adam Ronja, I handed out the pictures to a bunch of different people, it was pretty sweet."

They're pretty good, we played with em once and I bought both of their CDs and got hooked


I'm really really really really excited for summer
Definately ready to hang out with all my friends...
but also NFS is probably gonna get together and write some sweet new songs


Today, I practiced for awhile again...I'm really starting to disipline myself finally...I kind of need it too.


Went and played soccer with the presidents of E-Unit, HP, and other people.
I got brutally murdered, but I don't care, I had fun, and I actually scored...once


Exams are next week and I am actually confident, because I am not really stressed out about anything anymore...I've learned to be stress free, finally.

Can't wait to go to Interlochen next year, I got accepted...Kind of reluctant to lose my friends, but it's something I have to do...you all know who you are, and you'll definately be missed.


NFS is getting alot of shows, but we could use alot more this summer.

If your not busy on any of the dates (perhaps this friday, or the 17th of june with the SUICIDE MACHINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) come on out and check it out, you won't be let down...

unless of course you hate Ska.

Definately can't wait til this summer 2 weeks left!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The choir concert went well otherwise, The Girls did well, and so did the soloists in all of the songs. 

so yeah, Romeo and Juliet is the 18th 19th and 20th, and I hope to see everyone there. On the night of the 20th as well, at Jamestowne Hall, you can catch Nothing for Something, ask me for a ride, and I can speed you there as fast as possible (luckily we play last). I can't wait til the 20th, I finally get to see the band again, and we're actually gonna practice, it's gonna be sweet. 

So what was a shitty day became better...though alot of crappy stuff happened."

I had a voice lesson and almost got into an accident on the highway. 

-I pulled into the accel. lane, and then i started slipping, while trying to regain control my car pulled out into the highway and spun out. 

-I finally got back into control, slammed on the gas and pulled back onto the accel. lane (i was going backwords, with a semi coming towards me)

-Pulled a U-Turn and pulled back into the highway. 

wow...i hate rain. 


Then I had play practice. 

Kind of bummed out, because I just found out I can't go to Green Day, on the count of Cam not having the extra tick anymore, but I guess it's alright, no biggie. I'm checkin if there are anymore right now."

I just got back from a haunted barn, and it was pretty fun, I had a good time. 
 
This morning was Zarah's Birthday Brunch, Happy Birthday Zarah!!! the brunch was fun as well, there were quite a few people there. 

I went to play soccer as well, but it didn't last long, after that I went home, and then to Mal's, and that is when we decided to go to the haunted barn, it was Zarah, Christa, Jade, Mal, Heather N, and I, it was a wonderful time, Jade had to stand in the middle because she was so scared of it, it was pretty funny...but I felt kind of bad after laughing about it. 


Definately has been a wonderful week, I recieved a ticket to Greenday, I'm going to Taking Back Sunday (both next week) it's gonna be a good time."

Been having a wonderful week, I dunno why, it's just great. 

It feels like the weekend for some reason even though it's only Wednsday.


I can't wait to go back to school tomarrow though for some odd reason, it just feels really weird to be down here on a school day. 


It's a really nice campus though, actually i'm sitting in a computer lab with a beautiful wall that is actually a window next to me, and outside of it is a pond and a bunch of trees and stuff.

Yesterday I got home from Harry's party when I had a wonderful time

basically I was bored the whole day until 7...
I went over to the Haunted Cornfield out on Portsmouth. 
They had me working at a part that had a childrens playground. 
I needed to get down from the top of the slide, and the ladder was really slippry. So, I went down the slide instead, and some kid got in my way, i tried to hold back as to not kill the kid and my ancle got stuck in the mud and twisted inward...I heard a snap and was afraid it was broken...but I could somewhat walk on it. 



I went to the hospital just in case...and I waited





and waited......


and waited until the x-ray guy could tell me ""WOW that's really fricken swollen"" and then he x-rayed it and goes ""nope not broken"" and I'm like...""i figured that"" so then another guy came in and he told me it was badly sprained...so he got me some crutches, which yes I need very much so for 2 days because I can hardly even place pressure on my left leg, not that it hurts to much, but it feels like jello when I step on it and I think i'll fall down...which has happened twice. 


yay...what a wonderful day...

Classes today were pretty simple, and then we went to that mock debate thing or whatever, it was quite the fun time.


Band-...Let me sum it up here
--Cold
--Wet
I didnt want to stay for the whole game, but I did since I had no other choice...unfortunately we lost to Heritage.


After the game I drove over to HARRRYYY POTTTTEERRRRS, Sam Boy 1, Gina, Peter, Chelsea and Harry were there, and it was a good time. I spent the night and then had to come back at like 8 in the morning on the count of Petrius and Christabell having fighting practice for Romeo and Juliet

"event","Today I just basically sat in Computer apps next to Brandon and Ali talking about nothing relevant to the class at all, since we had all of our work done. It was quite a dramatic day in that class, as Chelsea K. was screaming at her computer about to kill it, it was quite funny on my side...but deep down I could see that she was frustrated...



Hickners class was...well...


Basically sitting there...listening to like a 10 minute lecture...watching the news and then the Daily show, and then noticing that we were already done with class and wasted the whole hour. 


Lunch with Harry, Sam Boy 2, Sam Girl 1, Gina, and Dana was great, we had McDonalds, and had a wonderful time, though not as wonderful as Chinese, it was still good. 



Play practice got canceled tonight on the count of being in a really small room with a bunch of loud high schoolers... But I did find out when I did show up, that I can get 3 volunteer hours on the count of scaring the living shit out of small children, so that is a big + for my day.

Lunch with Harry, Sam Girl 1, Sam Boy 2, and Gina was great, we had Chinese, and though I didn't get the order I originally wanted, it was still quite good, thanks again Harry & Sam. 


I went to Broadcasting and basically just sat there playing songs on the radio all hour, because that's what I have to do. 

Though I missed Chem, it was kind of good only going to blowoff classes the rest of the day.

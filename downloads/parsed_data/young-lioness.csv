"event","Remember when I posted <div class=""ljcut"" text=""this..."">There was a wind storm in April when Brian and I were in Philly, and it pulled some of the siding off the side of the upper floor of the rental house.&nbsp; I guess the weekend when Ruth and I were out of town, the landlord(s)&nbsp; and other people were at the house to fix it and do other stuff.&nbsp; It sounds like they had several vehicles there (besides the 3 that are there on a normal basis).&nbsp; Brian was out working in our yard.&nbsp; Some guys were on the roof working on fixing the siding and while they were up there, one of them started making comments to Brian, who was down in our yard.<br /><br />We park our cars on the street.&nbsp; We technically have access to a driveway, but we don't use it.&nbsp; (The neighbors on the other side technically own it, we just have an easement to use it, and it isn't paved, so it's not the greatest place to park.)&nbsp; One of the guys on the roof yells something to Brian like ""you need to keep your car parked at least 10' from our driveway...I might have to call the county to report you"" (or something like that) and added something like ""why don't you park in the driveway"".&nbsp; Brian said that we don't park in the driveway because it isn't paved, and that we can park on the street if we want to.&nbsp; Then the guy said something about us being ""lazy and ignorant"" and something about <u>having to come over and bash Brian's skull in</u> if we don't park our cars 10' away from the driveway.&nbsp; That's not a complete account of what was said, but you get the gist.<br /><br />So I take it that they've figured out that we were the ones who reported their property to the county last fall.&nbsp; And I guess that guy was trying really hard to find anything at all to call us out on.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing is, the guy who was making these remarks is someone neither of us had seen at the house before that day.&nbsp; There's a guy who shows up with a truck sometimes (who I guess was there at the time too) who has been friendly-ish to us in the past.&nbsp; We were assuming that he was the son of the landlord.&nbsp; The landlord and his wife are an older couple who we've seen working on the property every once in a while.&nbsp; But I guess the guy who was making these remarks is actually the landlord's son, and he lives on the street behind us and owns another rental house there.</div> <br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBeB81PPlng"">Guess who's on YouTube</a> and <a href=""http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-te.md.officer12feb12,0,2952754.story"">in the news</a>...yeah...doesn't surprise me in the least after what he said to Brian last summer...I hope he loses his job."

But I have something really weird to share in the meantime --

I came home from work tonight and drive up the street to our house and find a big group of people standing around with cameras and lights.&nbsp; And I think to myself ""oh shit, something crazy has happened to our house, like a plane crashing into it or a fire from a gas natural gas leak, and there's a news crew here reporting about it.""&nbsp; But the people parted and I pulled up in front of the house, and it appeared to be fine.

I get out of the car and one of the guys comes up and tells me that he is friends with the neighbors a few houses down and they are using our street to shoot scenes for an independent film.&nbsp; Um OK.&nbsp; As long as my house is alright, and I have a safe place to park, I guess I don't care what you are doing.&nbsp; He said that there will be fighting and yelling in a later scene and not to worry or call the cops if I hear yelling and fighting.

Very weird but kind of cool...nothing interesting ever happens on our street, unless it involves the trashy neighbors and I wouldn't call that interesting...I'd call it annoying.

But anyway...I forgot to get the mail when I came into the house (I'm expecting a package with new yarn) and now I'm afraid to go out to get it for fear of messing up their shooting....they are seriously RIGHT in front of our house.&nbsp; I guess I can wait until Brian gets home (and disturbs them to get into the driveway) to check the mail."

"event","<div class=""ljcut"">The tomatoes are ripening in the garden big time.&nbsp; Last week when I made sauce, I decided that I would alternate weeks between making sauce and making salsa.&nbsp; The goal is to be able to keep up with the tomatoes, but at the same time trying to be efficient with the work process, and minimize mess-making, since our kitchen is small and crappy.<br /><br />So since last week was a sauce week, this week is salsa week.&nbsp; I spent some time looking for recipes to try, and then I got turned on to the idea of canning the salsa instead of freezing it in ziplock bags.&nbsp; I think it is less likely to get buried like it will in the feezer and we will be more likely to eat it canned (after all, when you have a craving for chips and salsa, you don't exactly want to wait for it to thaw).<br /><br />So I read up on canning.&nbsp; I made a trip to Walmart (I hate them, but that was the only place where I was positive they'd have canning supplies).&nbsp; I'm doing the hot water bath method of canning, since I don't want to spend the money on a pressure canner.&nbsp; But I guess with the hot water method, you have to be kind of careful with the recipe that you use.&nbsp; I guess if the recipe isn't acidic enough, nasty stuff can grow and make you sick when you eat it.<br /><br />So I found a recipe I wanted to try.&nbsp; It calls for peeling the tomatoes, which I had never done before.&nbsp; So I peeled 40 tomatoes.&nbsp; That was actually kind of fun.&nbsp; Then I started removing the seeds and chopping them by hand.&nbsp; Crap, it takes a freaking long time!&nbsp; Peeling the tomatoes seems to make it harder to remove the seeds.&nbsp; The recipe calls for 8 cups of diced tomato, and my 40 tomatoes will get me maybe 5 cups (I stopped at 4 because my fingers were all shriveled up from the juice).&nbsp; So I think I'll just make half of a batch (3 pints) with that recipe.&nbsp; Here I was all proud of how domestic I was being by trying out canning, and just the first step in making the salsa has me ready to be done with the whole thing.&nbsp; I haven't even brought the canning stuff in from the car yet.<br /><br />I still have probably another 40 tomatoes to use up, so I'll try another recipe tomorrow.&nbsp; And I'll be lazy about it, and just remove the seeds and throw everything in the food processor.&nbsp; Martha Stewart I am not.</div>"

"event","Honey seems to be doing better today.

Yesterday afternoon she spit up blood 3 more times.&nbsp; I called the vet and they said that they couldn't get her in to look at her that late in the day but if we wanted to, we could have her stay there on an IV overnight.&nbsp; Brian and I were worried that having her spend the night in an unfamiliar place would upset her, and other than the blood issue, she has been acting perfectly happy (she loves nice days when we can have the windows open, and the past 3 days have been such), so we kept her home.&nbsp; After the recommended fast was up, we made her boiled chicken and rice, which she happily gobbled up.&nbsp; She didn't have any issues for the rest of the evening and the three of us hung out in our bed and watched a DVD.

Brian got up in the middle of the night to give her some more chicken because she was walking on him to wake him up.&nbsp; (Her signal for ""I'm out of food and I'm worried that I might starve before morning comes"".)&nbsp; This morning when I got up I found a small spot of chicken and rice that came back up, but no blood anywhere!&nbsp; She was meowing for more food so I gave her a bit more and I'll keep watching her to see how she does.&nbsp; We are waiting for the vet's office to call with her bloodwork results to see if that says anything and if they think we should bring her in to be checked out some more, we'll do it at that point.

We had planned to have a 4th of July party and had already sent the evite out, and we cancelled it yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; It might turn out that we cancelled it for nothing, but all of the people who had RSVP'd as ""yes""es so far are pet lovers, so they understand that for us having our cat puking up blood is like having a child puking up blood, and it's important to us to make sure she's OK and not upset her by bringing all kinds of strange people into the house.

*******************************************

Update about my sister and the house:

They made an offer on it, but because they haven't finished their projects and don't have their condo on the market yet, they made the offer contingent on the sale of their condo, and the company (the owners were transfered and as part of their moving package, a relocation company or somthing like that is selling it for them) didn't like the contingency.&nbsp; They've looked at more houses since then.

I'm glad that others agree that I'm not totally out there to be mad about the situation.&nbsp; And to answer a question, she and Josh aren't taking any time off to help with the kitchen stuff (my sister recently started a new job and doesn't have the time to take, and I think Josh thinks his time is more valuable than to spend it helping someone work on his own condo).&nbsp; My mom is probably the one handing my dad tools and such."

Their first choice date is June 28, 2008, and their second choice is June 21.&nbsp; I'm going to be her MOH and will be doing what I can to help her.&nbsp; (But I'm waiting to be asked rather than jumping in with suggestions.)&nbsp; It sounds like it is going to be a stressful planning process for my sister because her FMIL is very opinionated about EVERYTHING.&nbsp; (For instance, FMIL was hounding her to go and register for china and stuff so that FMIL's friends could buy them engagement gifts.&nbsp; Buying china as an engagement gift and planning a registry this early are things that just aren't done in the midwest, so it wasn't high on my sister's priority list, but she went and registered for china/flatware/crystal to appease her.&nbsp; Then her FMIL basically insults her taste by asking her if she's sure that the pattern she chose is what she really wants and offering to go with her to choose something else.&nbsp; This woman has BALLS when it comes to saying inappropriate things...hell, she's already made comments about how things are going to be when Alison and Josh have kids.)<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I will start looking for a job this spring, once my thesis is done, or at least further along.&nbsp; I'm ready to graduate and move on with my life...I'm ready to have employment and a paycheck again.&nbsp; I've been thinking a lot about what we will be able to do around the house once I have income again, and I'm quite excited about that.&nbsp; But at the same time, I try not to think about it too much because it feels like its a long way off still, and I have lots of other things to worry about before it makes sense to start thinking about that stuff.<br /><br />Well, that's about all I can think of for now.&nbsp; I can't promise that I'll be great about updating until maybe closer to March, but after that I should be around LJ a lot more, with a lot more to say.<br /></div>"

So I took them all out (even though their problem was only with one image).&nbsp; Sorry.<br /><br />So, here is what we had <strong>before</strong>...<br /><br />That picture was from either the first time we looked at the house or the day of the inspection...gives you an idea of what we started with.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/front.jpg"" /><br /><br />The evergreens are yews (probably my least favorite type of shrub), and there were a couple of azaleas among the overgrown yews, and one forsythia, which was in a bad&nbsp;location and&nbsp;had been hacked to the ground by the previous owner.&nbsp; My dad did a merciless hack job on the shrubs on either side of the steps so we could paint...it was neccessary but it made the landscaping look even worse.&nbsp; We did what we could by trimming everything up, but all of the shrubs were really old, had been planted too close together and many were too close to the house.&nbsp; It doesn't look quite so bad in these pictures because the azaleas were in bloom and we had just trimmed everything up.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSCF0398.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSCF0394.jpg"" /><br /><br />Last spring I bought an artificial lavender&nbsp;wreath at Target for the front door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last summer I painted the front door a periwinkle blue to kind of go with but not exactly match the lavender.&nbsp; One of my big things with this landscaping project was to finally have some of the plants that I've always loved...the most important of which were blue-flowering hydrangeas (see sig picture).&nbsp; So between the wreath, the front door, and wanting hydrangeas, I tried to go with a purple/blue/white flowering theme in choosing plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />There was nothing existing that was worth saving, so we paid a landscaping company to come out and rip everything out.&nbsp; They cut all of the shrubs out with chainsaws, chipped them up, and ground out the stumps.&nbsp; When that was complete, we had to deal with the lattice under the porch.&nbsp; I think it was original to the house and it was falling apart and rotting.&nbsp; So before we could do any landscaping, we built wood frames and used plastic lattice panels to hide the area under the porch.&nbsp; Here's a picture of the completed lattice panels right after we tilled up the areas for the new beds...<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSC_0076.jpg"" /><br /><br />The house looks kind of naked with no shrubs in front, but the new panels were a big improvement.<br /><br />Here is the little plan I sketched up for the project.&nbsp; It's kind of grubby because we had it ouside with us to measure and lay everything out, so it has gotten dirty.&nbsp; It has also changes a bit and there are things sketched in on top of other things because I changed my mind once or twice.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/plan-reduced.jpg"" /><br /><br />Our street runs southeast to northwest, so our house isn't square to the cardinal directions.&nbsp; When you are facing the house, the left side faces southeast, the front faces northeast, and the right faces northwest.&nbsp; So there isn't really a true north (shady) side...every side gets sun at some point during the day.&nbsp; I'd say the front is the most shady, but it does get sun from sunrise through most of the morning.&nbsp; Other issues to deal with...<br /><br />1)I could only go out 5' from the side of the house on the&nbsp;left side, next to the driveway area.&nbsp; Our driveway area is a shared-use easement (our neighbors own the land and we have use of it).&nbsp; They want to sell it to us and we plan to buy it eventually and put in a paved driveway, but that is another issue for another time.<br /><br />2) On the right side of the house there are wires running to the house from the poles along the street.&nbsp; This is pretty much right where I wanted to put a tree, so that limited what I could choose to put there.&nbsp; There are meters on the side of the house that are associated with the wires and further down on the same side we have two A/C units, so it would be nice to hide all of those things from street view.<br /><br />Our house sits up very high, so blocking windows isn't an issue at all...things would have to grow about 6-8' tall before reaching a window sill.<br /><br />I wanted to have definitive starting and stopping points for the beds...something non-arbitrary that made some sense.&nbsp; Plus we couldn't afford to go all the way around the house this year.&nbsp; So I started with a bed running from the side door that goes to the basement, around to the front near the steps, and then from the steps to the side where the A/C units are.&nbsp; I kept the bed lines pretty simple because our yard is small (40' wide lot plus a 10' shared access easement where our unpaved driveway is located), so there really isn't a lot of space for big sweeping curves.&nbsp; The front edge of the beds were set to match up with where the sidewalk starts to flare wider at the bottom of the steps.&nbsp; The bed purposely bubbles out at the right corner to accommodate a tree...I wanted to put something that would get taller to kind of anchor the corner and focus/frame the view when you are approaching the house from along the street.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind before I show you the after pictures...everything we planted is MUCH smaller than full size.&nbsp; I designed the plan so that when everything reaches full size, it will look filled-in but not crowded.&nbsp; But in the mean time, there are lots of big spaces with nothing in them.&nbsp; Eventually everything will fill in and take up the extra space.&nbsp; (See the plan above.)&nbsp; As I post our ""after"" picutures, I am also adding pictures from the internet to help you fill in the blanks with your imagination.&nbsp; And I'm sorry the pictures are kind of small.&nbsp; For some reason photobucket keeps making them smaller and it's pissing me off!!<br /><br />So showing everything from left to right, here's what we put in...<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSC_0087.jpg"" /><br /><br />You can see the door to the basement on the side of the house.&nbsp; The bed starts right next to it.&nbsp; Along this side we planted 3 blue-flowering butterfly bush.&nbsp; I ordered them from an online place, so they are only 6"" high right now (you get what you pay for, and they were very inexpensive), but they will get to be about 5' tall and 5' wide.&nbsp; They will look like this, but with bluish lavender flowers...<br /><br /><br /><br />Among the butterfly bush, I also planted periwinkle, which is a vining, flowering&nbsp;groundcover.&nbsp; They will spread about 2-3' wide and get about 6-8 inches tall.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the picture, you can see three shrubs near the steps.&nbsp; The one on the far left is Castle Wall holly and the one next to it is Castle Spire holly.&nbsp; There is another Castle Spire on the other side of the steps.&nbsp; The Castle Wall is the male holly that pollinates the two female (castle spire) hollies.&nbsp; These will grow about 3' wide and 8' tall, and I'm using them to kind of ""frame"" the front steps.&nbsp; They have berries which will turn red in the fall and add some color through the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />In front of the hollies, we put in a small massing of ornamental grasses...but again this is a ""you get what you pay for"" situation where I ordered them through the mail, and they aren't much to look at right now.&nbsp; They are dwarf fountain grass and grow to about 24- 30 inches tall/wide.<br /><br /><br /><br />In front of the grasses we planted a grouping of 'Autumn Joy' sedum, which are perennials and bloom at the end of summer and into the fall.&nbsp; This is kind of a diversion from my color scheme (the flowers start out green, turn pink, then age into a russet), but I wanted to have grasses, and these always look good paired with grasses, so I had to have them too.<br /><br /><br /><br />The other shrub in the picture (the one on the right, towards the bottom of the steps) is a Summersweet.&nbsp; There is another on the other side of the steps.&nbsp; They bloom with white flowers in the summer and smell very good.&nbsp; They will get about 4-5' tall and 3-4' wide.<br /><br /><br /><br />At the bottom of the steps on either side of the sidewalk, I've left a spot to plant some annuals each year.&nbsp; I'm not really big on annuals (I generally prefer perennials) but I wanted to be able to have a little area that I could change-up from year to year.&nbsp; I planted blue lobelias there this year.&nbsp; (Mine aren't nearly as filled-in as these, though,)<br /><br /><br /><br />Moving on to the other side of the steps...<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSC_0086.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSC_0089.jpg"" /><br /><br />Next to the steps are a Castle Spire Holly (furthest to the back), with a summersweet and lobelia in front of it, like the other side.&nbsp; In front of the lattice panels, we planted white-flowering clematis.&nbsp; We both wanted blue-flowering (since white flowers won't have any contrast against the white lattice) but the nursery we were at was out and we didn't want to have to come back again.<br /><br /><br /><br />In front of the clematis, to the right of the summersweet are three cherry laurel, which are broad-leaf evergreen shrubs.&nbsp; They don't grow in Indiana (which is where I learned plants) so I was very happy to find this evergreen option. (I'm picky about evergreen shrubs.)&nbsp; They will grow to about 4' tall and 6' wide, so they will fill in as a nice mass of green across the front.&nbsp; They also get white flowers.<br /><br /><br /><br />In front of the cherry laurel is a big space for perennials.&nbsp; I didn't want to spend much more money this summer, so we only put in one grouping of prennials...Royal Candles Speedwell.&nbsp; I really like them, and they seem to be very happy in their location.<br /><br /><br /><br />At the corner of the house, the bed sweeps out in a larger radius.&nbsp; At the center we wanted to put a tree, but we were limited in size because of the wires.&nbsp; I wanted a Serviceberry, but DH didn't like them as much as the magnolias we looked at, so we ended up with a Sweetbay Magnolia.&nbsp; It is white-flowering from late spring through early summer (so I'm guessing soon).<br /><br /><br /><br />Surrounding the magnolia tree we've planted hydrangeas.&nbsp; As the years go by and both they and the tree get bigger, we'll limb up the tree a bit.&nbsp; We ended up with Endless Summer Hydrangeas.&nbsp; They don't have any blooms on them yet though.&nbsp; I hope they bloom this year.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y230/young_lioness/DSC_0090.jpg"" /><br /><br />Behind the magnolia, at the corner of the house, we planted a firethorn (pyracantha).&nbsp; Right now it's quite narrow, and about 4' tall, but it will grow to be 5' wide and 8' tall.&nbsp; It will get white flowers in the spring and lots of orange berries in the fall that last into the winter.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that it will be evergreen in this climate (it's semi-evergreen in Indiana).<br /><br /><br /><br />Between the firethorn and the A/C units, we planted three Oakleaf Hydrangeas.&nbsp; I LOVE oakleaf hydrangeas almost as much as the blue-flowering hydrangeas.&nbsp; They will grow to about 6' tall &amp; wide.&nbsp; They get big white flowers in the summer (which dry up and stay on into the winter) and the leaves turn pretty russet colors in the fall.<br /><br /><br /><br />As on the other side with the butterfly bush, you get what you pay for, and they are only 6"" tall right now.&nbsp; I saw larger ones selling for $80 each at a nursery, so I'm happy with watching them grow for $8 each.<br /><br />For anyone who is interested, we bought almost everything from Valley View Farms in Cockeysville/Hunt Valley.&nbsp; With the exception of the cherry laurel, which we bought from Poor Boy's in Parkville, and the butterfly bush, grasses, and oakleaf hydrangeas, which I ordered from <a href=""http://www.bluestoneperennials.com/b/bp/index.html"">Bluestone Perennials</a>.&nbsp; And the speedwell and endless summer hydrangeas we bought at Lowe's.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>"

"event","I'm going to have my hair colored today!  I'm kind of nervous because I don't know how it will turn out, but I'm excited because I'm SOOO ready for something different.  I'm not getting it cut because I've decided to keep growing it out.  I'm learning that ""something different"" doesn't have to mean ""chop it all off"".

I think I want to go with something just a little bit darker/richer than my natural color.  I've been getting highlights done for about five years and my hair has gotten quite light at the ends.  I haven't highlighted in over 6 months, so I finally have an idea of what my natural color is. (A very flat, light-to-medium brown.)  But now that it has started to grow out, it's a gradient from medium brown at the roots to medium blonde at the ends.  Good thing the curliness hides it some.

I'm a tad worried that going darker is going to make me look older.  But I guess I'm not THAT old yet so really, how old can it make me look?

Hopefully I'll be back later...happy and with pictures."

"event","Over the past two weeks, I haven't gotten in as much knitting time as I would like.  But next week should be a slow week schoolwork-wise, so I should be able to get some good knitting time in this weekend.

Knitting Past...

I finished the Irish Hiking scarf for my dad last month.  

Knitting Current...

I'm 2 1/2 balls (of 4 or 5) into Knitty's Wavy for my sister.  I worked on it some while we were in line to tour Monticello this weekend.  The woman behind us in line wished that she had brought her knitting to work on. ;-)

I cast on my first sock, using the yarn and book sent by my Secret Pal, but I feel guilty every time I work on it for spending time knitting for myself when I still have so much Christmas gift knitting to do.  So I'm going to save the sock knitting for Thanksgiving break and set that knitting time aside so I can knit just for me.  Plus I won't be in any danger of family members seeing their future gift as a work-in-progress.

Knitting Future...

Today I plan to buy yarn at A.C. Moore for Interweave Knits ""Dylan Goes Electric"" sweater for Brian's birthday.  <lj_user>congogirl</lj_user> is starting a knitalong for it and <lj_user>banannapouch</lj_user>, <lj_user>art_vs_craft</lj_user> and I are joining in.  I'm not sure what color I'm going to use.  It depends on what they have, but I'm thinking either natural/beige, navy, or olive green.  Brian owns way too much gray and black and he's not really too adventurous with wearing colors, so any of those three colors should be safe, but yet different from what he already has.

I'm also going to buy yarn for MIL's scarf, so I can start that when I finish my sister's.  I'm going to use the celtic cable pattern on the cardigan from the Fall Knitty to make a scarf for her.  I made the mistake of letting Brian choose the yarn for it last weekend, and he chose the lion brand suede yarn because it was soft and he thought she'd like it.  I gave it a try and it is less than ideal for cabling (and I think less than ideal for knitting in general, if you like to be able to see the stitches) so I need to return what I haven't already opened.

I'm wavering on what I want to make for my mom.  I was thinking of making Knitty's Flora, but I can't decide what color to make.  I'll work on MIL's scarf first to give me more time to decide on my mom's.

I'm behind on taking pictures.  I'll have to take some when after I finish Wavy and cast on for Dylan Goes Electric."

I'm around.  I've been busy, and when I haven't been busy, I've been in a very ""poor me"" mood, so that's why my LJ has been kinda quiet lately.

I have to go into work this morning.  Uggg.  I'm hoping I can trade these hours for some hours off this coming week.

Brian wants to go to the Octoberfest thing that they're having at the Timonium fairgrounds.  I think I'm going to tell him to go without me (the plan is to meet a group of his friends up there).  I don't know much about Ocktoberfests other than they serve lots of beer and brats, neither of which I like at all (and I'm not a fan of the Timonium fairgrounds either).  My free time has become too valueable to me to give up a whole afternoon to attend an event I have no interest in.  If he goes, I can stay home and get ahead on my school stuff, so I can have the rest of the weekend free.

Things I do want to do this weekend:
call my sister to wish her a happy birthday
knit
watch the SATC DVD that came from Netflix weeks ago and has just been sitting around
go to Wegmans
use my Ann Taylor Loft coupon/savings certificates"

<P>It rained a ton on Saturday, and we ended up with water in our basement (again).&nbsp; We're going to see about getting some estimates on getting it fixed.&nbsp; It's nothing horrible, but it's just a total PITA more than anything else.&nbsp; We aren't able to put any cardboard boxes touching the floor, or they end up getting wet, because when the water comes in it runs every-which-way, so there's no place to put&nbsp;them and guarantee that they won't get wet.&nbsp; We have most things in plastic containers, but we had a few empty boxes we were storing, and our Christmas tree came in a cardboard box.&nbsp; This is the second or third&nbsp;time that box has gotten wet, and I think I need to replace it with some kind of plastic containers.&nbsp; At least we are all set up with the dehumidifier we bought the last time this happened.&nbsp; The water has stopped coming in, and it's drying up pretty fast.</P>
<P>Today is an all-day school work day for me.&nbsp; (Brian is out for a day of football-watching at the bar with some friends.) I have three things due on Tuesday...which is also our 2nd anniversary.</P>
<P>1) A critique of a journal article (DONE)</P>
<P>2) The results of the survey I've mentioned/complained about several times before (about half done...need to have totally done by the end of the night)</P>
<P>3) Mid-term project that I've barely started (I have an outline, and I've found some articles to use for my literature review, but I have yet to read them or start writing anything)</P>
<P>Another rant ahead...</P>
<P>I had forgotten how much I hate writing papers.&nbsp; I'm definitely more of a creative project or oral report kind of a person.&nbsp; And I especially hate having to write using APA style.&nbsp; It's just so structured, and ugly, and blah.&nbsp; I understand its purpose, but I just hate having to work within such a ridgid format and produce work that is so void of any personality or style (visual style).</P>
<P>If I make a reasonable amount of progress on item #2 by 6 or 7pm, I might make a quick trip over to A.C. Moore to buy yarn for the scarf I'll be making my MIL for Christmas.&nbsp; And then maybe pick up some Panera for dinner.&nbsp; I need some kind of reward to motivate myself though this.</P>"

"event","Thank you again, Secret Pal.  I was very surprised to get another package so soon.

I love the little cat keychain.  That's perfect for me because I don't wear a watch, but I usually have my keys with me.  And I'm SO excited to start learning to knit socks with the book and yarn you sent.  I picked up some DPN's a few weeks ago, and now I have everything I need to get started.

Thank you!"

"event","Honey has been so funny lately.  It seems like every day she does something that makes me laugh.

She seems to like having me around the house more during the day.  She comes and sits in the orange Ikea chair next to me if I'm working on the computer, or comes to sit on my lap if I'm reading on the couch.  When I have reading assignments, it often takes a few hours to get through them all, so she has plenty of time to get all nestled in and comfy.  If I have my legs stretched out straight, she lay all stretched out on top of me, with her front paws stretched out in front of her, down to my ankles, and her back legs stretched out to my waist.

A few weeks ago, she lost her favorite toy.  I made her one of the catnip toys from Knitty and she loves it.  When she's not playing with them, we put her toys in her cat bed.  Brian said that he would see her get toys out and she would always get that one out first.  Somehow she lost it, and she was all distraught for a week and would go around meowing and looking for it.  We looked for it and couldn't figure out where it went.  I was starting to feel really bad and I was thinking I'd have to make her another one.  Well, she must have found it because one day she was playing with it underneath my desk.

I mentioned a week or two ago that we bought a new bedding set.  Last week I put it on the bed for the first time, and she came running, jumped up on it and stretched out purring, and giving me a look like ""Oh...thank you so much for the new comforter.  The other one wasn't bad, but this one is really nice.  Thank you for thinking of me.""  As if we bought new bedding just because we thought she would like it.  And she does really like it.  The fabric is smoother than the old comforter, so I think it must feel cooler for her to lay on or something.

Sometimes I think that we spoil our cat way too much.  But then I go to Petsmart and see things like seasonal cat toys (they have Halloween ones right now) and I realize that there are people who spoil their pets way more than we do, and it makes me feel more normal.  Not that there's anything wrong with seasonal toys, but I gotta draw the line somewhere, and for me, that is it.

Anyway...I hadn't told any Honey stories in a while, so I figured I'd get them out all at once."

<P>I'm going to participate in <A href=""http://www.secretpalsix.blogspot.com/"">Secret Pal 6</A>.&nbsp; (Basically a ""secret santa"" type of a deal, but for knitters.)&nbsp; SP's are supposed to be sent out today, so I figured I'll post my answers to the questionaire before I forget.</P>
<P>1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer higher quality and/or natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I don't think I'm an experienced enough knitter yet to be a complete yarn snob, but I'm on my way there.&nbsp; I like higher quality yarn, I'm not against cheaper yarn (like Lion Brand), but I try to avoid the cheapest of the cheap yarn (like Red Heart).<BR><BR></FONT>2. Do you spin? Crochet?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Nope and nope.</FONT><BR><BR>3. Do you have any allergies? (smoke, pets, fibers, perfume, etc.)</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I'm not a fan of smoke, but I'm not allergic to anything.</FONT><BR><BR>4. How long have you been knitting?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>About 9 months</FONT><BR><BR>5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Yes, I have an Amazon list, but it's just full of (expensive) Urban Planning books, so not really relevant to SP<BR></FONT><BR>6. What's your favorite scent? (for candles, bath products etc.)</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Lily of the Valley (or lavender or peach)</FONT><BR><BR>7. Do you have a sweet tooth?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Yes!&nbsp; I love me some chocolate!</FONT><BR><BR>8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I sew things (like window treatments) for our house, but that's more like work, while knitting is for fun.</FONT><BR><BR>9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (if your buddy wants to make you a CD)</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>The short answer is that I like pretty much anything but country.&nbsp; Right now some of my favorite artists are The Killers, White Stripes, Foo Fighters, and Cake.&nbsp; I have the capability of playing MP3s.</FONT><BR><BR>10. What's your favorite color? Or--do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer? Any colors you just can't stand?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I don't have a favorite.&nbsp; I go through color phases.&nbsp; This spring/summer it was pink and spring green.&nbsp; Now it's autumn colors, especially pumpkin orange and brick red.&nbsp;Or pink and mocha brown.&nbsp; I'm not really a fan of purple or gray or really really bright colors.</FONT><BR><BR>11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I live with my husband of nearly two years (2nd anniversary is October 11th), Brian,&nbsp;and our cat, Honey.</FONT><BR><BR>12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know)</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>To do more travel (US and international) and eventually live in a college town and work as a professor.<BR></FONT><BR>13. What is/are your favorite yarn/s to knit with?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I don't have any favorites...I kind of view yarn on more of a project-by-project basis than yarn for the sake of yarn.&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;knit socks and lace, so I'm interested in sock yarn and lace weight yarn.<BR></FONT><BR>14. What fibers do you absolutely *not* like?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I don't like furry or feathery novelty yarns.</FONT><BR><BR>15. What is/are your current knitting obsession/s?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000><A href=""http://www.artyarns.com/newsite/yarn_main.htm"">Art Yarns</A> Supermarino...I just finished Clapotis using Colorway 105, and I plan to try some modular patterns (haven't chosen colorways yet) once my Modular Knitting book arrives from Amazon.com.<BR></FONT><BR>16. What is/are your favorite item/s to knit?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Things that don't take lots of time.&nbsp; (Scarves, hats, bags, etc.)&nbsp; I've knit one sweater and have another as a WIP, but I don't really have the attention span for sweaters or blankets.&nbsp; This is part of why I'm interested in learning to knit socks.<BR></FONT><BR>17.

What do you think about ponchos?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>They can be cute if the pattern is interesting, but in general they are unflattering.</FONT><BR><BR>19. Do you prefer straight or circular needles?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Either, depending on the project.<BR></FONT><BR>20. Bamboo, aluminum, plastic?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I have a Denise set which I love.&nbsp; For straight needles I prefer aluminum and I prefer bamboo for DPN's.</FONT><BR><BR>21. Are you a sock knitter?<BR><BR><FONT color=#660000>Not yet, but hopefully soon.<BR></FONT><BR>22. How did you learn to knit?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>A lady at work taught me and others to knit garter stitch scarves over a few lunch hours.&nbsp; From there I've picked up new skills by choosing projects that require me to learn something new.&nbsp; My newest skill is cabling, which is surpisingly easy.</FONT><BR><BR>23. How old is your oldest UFO?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>About 7 months old...a garter stitch scarf I lost interest in once the weather started to warm up and I learned more advanced knitting skills.</FONT><BR><BR>24. What is your favorite animated character or a favorite animal/bird?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>I like frogs.</FONT><BR><BR>25. What is your favorite holiday?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Autumn.&nbsp; I know, it's not really a holiday, but I celebrate it like it's one.</FONT><BR><BR>26. Is there anything that you collect?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>Not really.</FONT><BR><BR>27. What knitting magazine subscriptions do you have?</P>
<P><FONT color=#660000>None.&nbsp; I like Interweave Knits, but I don't have a subscription.</FONT><BR><BR>28. Any books out there you are dying to get your hands on?</P>

Last night we were out at a restaurant and I read the news about Rehnquist's death on the Fox News ticker (not my choice of news source, but that's what was on in the restaurant).  It totally ruined my mood for the rest of the night.  

When our Pittsburg friends C & L were here last weekend, we had a conversation about how hopeful we felt about the country this time last year.  It's just plain painful to think about how I felt a year ago and then compare it to how I feel now. Uhhhhgg....

I think I need a Daily Show fix.  It's been reruns this week, but I think new episodes start again on Tuesday.  Somehow seeing all of the horror with a humorous spin makes it not seem quite so bad.  (Although, good luck to them on figuring out how to cover the shitstorm that has erupted since their last new episode.)"

On the one hand, I can sympathise with their parents who probably said to them ""those are outside toys...why don't you go outside if you want to use them"". (And take your bikes, so you can annoy the whole neighborhood with them.)  But on the other hand, there are people like us who specifically don't want to have kids yet because we aren't ready to have our lovely Saturday morning sleeping-in shattered by kids blowing whistles.  Gahhh!  I swear, I'm ready to stab out my own eardrums with my knitting needles!"

<P>Notice that I didn't bold Jimmy Buffet's ""Margaritaville"".&nbsp; Yes, unlike pretty much everyone of my generation, I HATE, HATE, HATE, Jimmy Buffet.&nbsp; His voice is just too hillbilly-sounding for me to listen to for any length of time.</P>"

I walked 5 blocks to meet with someone at the county planning office and then back again, and I had to stop and buy a bottle of water because I thought I was going to die from the heat.

**********************

Today I realized something...no matter how long I live here, I will never care about Baltimore sports teams.

A few days ago, people were all worked up about one of the Orioles players being suspended for steroid use, and today the big talk is that they fired their manager.  It's really of absolutely no interest to me, which surprises me a bit.  After living here for five years, I expected to care more than I do.  If I don't care by now, I guess I probably never will.

The Ravens on the other hand, are in a different category of ""not caring"", related to bad feelings about Art Modell moving the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore and all that.  That's more of a ""I don't really care, but if they do really badly it kind of makes me happy inside"" kind of thing."

"event","I know several of you are Ikea shoppers.  If you get the chance, check out their new 2006 catalog!  (There was one in our Sunday paper, which is delivered on Saturday mornings for some reason.)

It looks like they're starting to sell some collections that are much more ""Pottery Barn-esque"" than what they've ever had before, which is great, since our house isn't very suited to Swedish-modern stuff.  It's still Ikea, so I know it won't last forever, but I'm just super-excited to see them sell some stuff that isn't super modern."

"event","Today we made our first harvest from our garden....two zucchini and two green peppers.  We're going to add some mushrooms and make a stir-fry tonight.

The broccoli and peas have turned out to be a complete bust, the rabbits have eaten most of the lettuce, and its not really time yet for the beans and corn to be doing anything yet.  But we're on the verge of an explosion of zucchini, yellow summer squash, cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes.  

Anyone have any good recipes to use up the zucchini and summer squash?  All I can think of to do with them right now is roast, grill, or stir-fry them.  Or make vegetable lasagna.  And Brian wants to make zucchini bread, but that doesn't sound like anything I would eat.  Is there such a thing as zucchini soup?  I'm looking for things that will use up a lot at once, and can be stored for a while (don't have to be eaten immediately)."

Do you knit English or Continental?

I was taught to knit English, but I've heard that Continental is the faster method of the two.  And that Continental is easier for lefties (like me) because you hold the yarn with your left hand.

I'm thinking of giving Continental a try.  Any thoughts?"

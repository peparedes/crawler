if i had a gun, i would be dead. i would have killed myself a long time ago.
i would jump off the 18th fl balcony but i think i'd hit the tree or the fence and not die, or i'd land on someone on the sidewalk.
other options are the third rail + the train, or sleeping pills + bathtub. not sure if that works. sleeping pills don't but in a tub i might drown.
i can't cut my arms, it's too scary. 
but a gun.... a gun would be perfect. instant. pull the trigger and you're done. i wouldn't write a letter. no one to say goodbye to. no one i care about. why am i here anyway. what the fuck am i doing."

joanna newsom's new album has been an outlet. inspires me to write again, write poetry. the act of writing is like turning the release valve. she said something in an interview like, the album is about what human experience we own apart from the sovereignty of time.

went to patrice and chris's wedding. it was lovely. next day went to a gay xmas house party in queens. whit's ex was there. they are friendly which kind of bothers me. oh well. i'm writing this stuff down why? because sometimes when i read old entries, the brief accounts of past activities are really fascinating and surprising to me. memory is weak.

i've been trying to find jeff (jeff g?), this guy i used to know online when i was like a teenager or college student. he was around my age. he lived in palm beach and then went to new york (nyu?) briefly. he was a great poet, so immensely creative. i cannot find him online. his website was implicate.net/big, and i've tried the Internet Archive and his old webmaster, but no luck.

in honor of him, here's a brilliant poem he wrote (like over 10 years ago, as a kid!).

"event","i have been feeling really low. well, maybe that's not it. i don't know how to write about this stuff anymore. i am sad. but this sadness is somehow broader and thinner than sadness i've felt in the past. this feels like high school. fear about the future, a lingering hopelessness. it's not like the sadness of college and post-college years. that sadness was like violent knife wounds and third-degree burns, whereas this sadness is like dull chronic never-ending pain. i feel so hopeless. i hate even talking about it, but i have no one... do i need someone. i don't know. if i ask myself why i feel this way... it's hard... i don't... have real connections. i am incapable. i never feel happy. using logic, i try to make myself recognize i should be grateful, but that is forced and intellectual. it is not emotional. 

i don't have real friends. i think MOST people don't have real friends. but most people are okay with that. i am not. lately i hate social situations because all interactions feel false. i enjoy being at work because that setting is inhuman and structured and inherently anti-social. but my job does not give me enough sense of value or purpose (even though i really do like it). lately i think: people have never made you happy, so give up on trying to derive happiness from people. instead, derive happiness from work and study. that might work, but it depends on my work being fully satisfying morally and intellectually. it is not morally fulfilling. 

anyway, should i give up on people? i hate them. no i don't. yes i do. maybe i'll stop faking and show everyone how fucking tired and bored i am with them. then i will lose all friends. 

i am rambling and none of this makes sense. 

lately i have been thinking more and more about suicide. and all the ramifications. for instance, 1) how would i apologize effectively to my parents, and to my partner? no one else matters. 2) how would i tell my partner that i don't want to have children anymore because as a parent i wouldn't be able to kill myself? 3) isn't there anything else i want to do in this world, like travel and see new cultures, or try to make the world a better place? the short answer to that question is ""NO. it won't make you happy, and it doesn't matter.""

pretty much everything i do and have ever done is for other people's approval, but i'm finding that when i get that approval, i don't feel any happier. 

when i can change my health insurance at the end of the year, then i will be able to start going to therapy. maybe i will get on anti-depressants. but honestly, i fail to see how either of things can help. they can't vanquish my fundamental belief that nothing matters and nothing lasts. they won't make me feel connected to anything or anyone."

"event","been reading 'a little life' by hanya yagihara. posted a bit about it on my other blog sullenskies on blogger (aside: i have 3 blogs, have for years, and they have  different levels of disclosure, with this one being the most honest and raw). i keep crying while reading the book. it also makes me feel physically weak, so weak i want to lay down and even sitting on my bones/muscle/fat feels grotesque. 

since this is my honest blog, i'll jump to the dark thoughts triggered by this incredible book. but will start off by saying that i am generally healthier/happier now than i've ever been. and that's good. but the book is also awakening me to darker deeper currents that have never stopped flowing as i've become ... more well? mostly, the book makes me question what happiness is, and if i'm happy now, and if i'll ever be happy. i experience categorically amazing things in my life, but i rarely feel joyful. i am grateful in a cerebral sense. i recognize that cosmic calculus is hard and cold, and that it's staggeringly improbable for any one to experience any shred of comfort or pleasure at all. but i have. but the knowledge of that is not enough to make me feel happy or connected or... i don't know what i'm saying. i'm bitching and moaning about my lame first-world problems. i am so fortunate. but sometimes--not often anymore--i feel like killing myself. and not out of a desperate sadness or hopelessness that begs escape, like before. now it's a gentle muted urge, a needling boredom. a voice asking ""why not?"""

"event","gonna try to do a lil journaling again. because i want to be thoughtful/reflective about my experiences so i don't take them for granted. i have a lot to be grateful for. i experience awesome shit every day and then forget about it.

so, recently:

- i had dinner at a korean restaurant with mike, and we had a good time catching up. our relationship has generally been very distant, even before we left japan. he told me about his family and his job and his fears and desires. then a couple weeks later, we went to a gay tech cocktail hour and had more good conversation. spending time with him felt the easiest and most authentic of probably all the times we've ever hung out, even in japan (though my memories of that time are all but obliterated).

- i went to DC for xmas with whit. we got a hotel room suite with his family. we stayed at the willard hotel, which is super fancy. DC was pretty, but i'd like to see the real DC, not just the monuments and museums and upper class hotels. i had a great time, though. being w/ his family was enjoyable and easier than before.

- a couple couch surfers from taiwan stayed with us: romy and jeff. they are sweet and young and very asian. :P i hope we can visit them in taiwan some day, but i honestly don't know when that would every happen. it's not exactly top of my destinations list.

- had a magical thanksgiving with jacob and a new couple i hadn't met before, kristen and jens, and their apartment. they were both so smart and easy going and great conversationalists. it was an irreproducible, fleeting kind of night, which made it all the more joyous and precious. i wonder if i'll ever see them again.

- wonderful art consumed recently:
tv: kids on the slope, attack on titan
music: bill evans trio, art blakey (both due to kids on the slope), and lots lots lots of john adams
books: all of the hainish cycle by ursula k le guinn. especially loved The Dispossessed, which is the kind of book that can fundamentally change you. i feel i had a sizeable shift. i was already (i hope) non-materialistic, but that book gave such a stance a clarity of logic as to form a permanent foundation for my life (again, i hope).  

i have been feeling depressed, hopeless, cynical, etc. about money's corruptive influence in american politics. at this point, no one is even presenting solutions because it seems like we're past the tipping point. i feel powerless as a regular citizen and, though i hate to say it, actually believe i AM powerless."

i feel positive. sad, yet positive. i need to focus on me. i think that means not hanging out with whit. therapist said it would be masochistic and counter productive, that it would make it about him, when it needs to be about me. i do miss him, i do want him, and there's a big part of me that hopes he'll choose to have me back, but i need to be comfortable by myself first.

i am reading ""bring yourself to love."" after that i'm gonna read ""the power of now"" and ""getting past your breakup."" the book that has the greatest effect on me has been ""the four agreements.""

good things today:
1) after a difficult meeting w/ a well-meaning co-worker, he offered a semi-apology. it was big of him. it made me feel much better.

"event","today i went to unity church which is this hippie church i've been going to on and off for several years now. this morning i went to a 30min discussion before service about relationships. it was great. here are my notes:

1) discernment is not the same as judgement. the former is an observation without a value call. e.g. ""your shirt is ugly"" is not the same as, ""i am better than you because your shirt is ugly.""
2) give out positive energy - it will come back. don't hunker down into negativity. that is easy to do. it is based on fear.
3) namaste - acknowledge the connectedness of my soul and the soul of every person i meet
4) we are one, yet we are also islands. we can visit other's islands.
5) everyone is walking around holding up a mirror to their faces, including me. i can put my mirror down and really see. but i can't make someone else put their mirror down.
6) even though we like to put ppl in boxes to help us understand how to ""manage"" them, ultimately everyone is the same because we all want the same things: to be loved, to be accepted, to have peace.

i want to test this out. i want to give positive energy to whit. last night i wrote a goodbye letter to him and burned it rather than mailed it. i'm glad i did. the letter was passive aggressive and had lots of self pity. let me try a different one now:

dear whit,
i'm sorry for hurting you. i hope you find what you're looking for. i know you will. you deserve to be happy, and you will be happy. 
although it saddens me to be apart from you, i respect your choice to not be with me. please know that i love you very much, despite the terrible mistakes i've made at times, and that i'm here for you if you need anything. you don't owe me anything, and it is not my intent to guilt you back into a relationship. you can make your own decisions, choose your own path, and be your authentic self.
love,
tim"

"event","<p>feeling sad and ugly and really really trying to fight it. weird stuff is going on. bf and i are in an open relationship. have been for a couple months. he's going hogwild with it, sleeping around, and i would too, but i'm not as attractive or extroverted, so i struggle. i get rejected a lot. people see a body pic online, we flirt, then i send them a face pic and they block me. they actually block me, like i need to be quarantined. it hurts. i wish i didn't compare myself to bf so much, but it almost feels like a race, and he's winning. he has no problems. he's horny all the time and has tons of guys hitting on him. i feel ugly and really have to work to get laid.</p><p>there's something else that's even more disturbing. i'm trying to keep an open mind about it, i really am... bf has always been a 'top' while i'm a 'bottom,' meaning he penetrates and i don't. i've always been grossed out by ""vers"" ppl, i.e. those ppl who can do and want both, to fuck and be fucked. i've learned through sneaky means that bf has actually bottomed for guys, and that he likes it. this unsettles me. i find it very unattractive. i have a limited, heteronormative outlook i realize, but still. i've heard of relationships ending because of these kinds of sexual incompatibilities. also, i hate hate hate that he's keeping this a secret from me, but i understand why he would because he knows i find tops who bottom repulsive. he probably doesn't feel very free. still, the lying is bad. </p><p>i'm going to try to give him opportunities to tell the truth while i continue to sneak on him. i want him to tell the truth of his own accord. i will try this for a couple months, and if he never does, then i'll confront him about it. i don't want that to happen.</p><p>also.</p><p>late friday night i hit on a straight guy friend hoping he would make out with me, cuz he's that type, but he declined. we were both drunk and having fun. he had the perfect opportunity but clearly he felt no desire. i took it personally. i take it all personally. </p><p>i'm in a dark room with people i desire, they are close enough to me that i can see them in the light above me, but one by one they are fading away in to the dark, walking backwards from me until i'm left alone, i'm feeling very alone in the dark as they leave me they are leaving me i'm feeling very alone empty and tired i need to do laundry tonight i wonder what he's doing i feel alone i guess it's ok i'm worried</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","i have a lot to say. but can't write anymore. forgot how. dumb, mute, busy. bf and i are in open relationship. i was unsatisfied sexually because i have low self-esteem and want the whole world to desire and experience me, not just one person. so i've fooled around. even went to a nasty group sex party (not the good kind of nasty). and he's fooled around too. more than me. cuz he's very attractive, is a big dicked top, and is confident and assertive. but the openness and sex w/ other ppl has actually brought us closer together, i think. i mean it. i'm not lying to myself. i now am more affectionate with him and attracted to him. because i see him as a sexual object again, and i myself feel sexually attractive. also, my libido for sex w/ other ppl has decreased (e.g. tonite i had the chance to meet someone but i didn't want to) and my libido for him has increased. 

anyway. going to china and japan in a couple days. i'll probably have nervous breakdown in japan. even going to mori. i think i'll be fine. i am an adult. i am not trying to recreate anything. the past has passed."

no rain

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
and speak my point of view
But it's not sane, It's not sane

I just want some one to say to me
I'll always be there when you wake
Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
escape...escape...escape...
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
ya don't like my point of view
ya think I'm insane
Its not sane...it's not sane."

Looking in your eyes, I see a paradise.
This world that I found is too good to be true.
Standing here beside, I want so much to give you this love in my
heart that I'm feeling for you.
Let them say we're crazy.
I don't care about that.
Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back.
Let the world around us just fall apart.
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart.
And we can build this thing together, stand in stone forever,
nothing's gonna stop us now.
And if this world runs out of lovers we'll still have eachother.
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now.
I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you, whatever it
takes to stay here with you.
Take it too the good times, see it through the bad times.
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do.
Let them say we're crazy.
What do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go.
Let the world around us just fall apart.
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart.
Oh, all that I need is you.
All that I ever need.
All that I want to do is hold you forever, forever and ever."

HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS - The Transition

So here we are
Back to the start again 
Trying hard to wait 'til morning 

Hey, Rise and shine 
And open up your eyes
To give this world some color 
Shine on diamond eyes
Seperate the space between love and lies 

And as days go by, the memories remain
I'll wait for you.
And as days go by the memories remain
I won't let go.
These days remain the same. 
Pictures fade away 

Please don't ever, change.
Please don't change your mind 
No matter what they say 
I'll always wait.

And as days go by, the memories remain
I'll wait for you.
And as days go by, the memories remain
I won't let go.
These days remain the same. 
Pictures fade away...

I hope you never...fade.
As you drip through my...veins.
Shine on (Shine on) Shine on
Diamond eyes.
Shine on (Shine on) Shine on
Diamond eyes.
Shine on (Shine on) Shine on
Diamond eyes.

As days go by the memories remain
I'll wait for you.
As days go by
I swear I'll try until I die
Anything for you"

"event","i can't wait until i have a kid of my own. that's all i'll ever need. no more lying boyfriends, or husbands at that, no more backstabbing friends, no more bullshit excuse for a father. nothing like that!! everyone in this fucking world is so two-faced or liers. but me and my kid... that's all i'll ever need. my baby will never turn it's back on me. i'll finally have someone to care for and love and be with and share things with, and will get the same in return. i won't have to think twice about whether ot not their lying or if they love me or not. i won't have to worry about ne thing. we all go through life and people screw up. we dump friends and leave boyfriends... but your kid will always be there and that's exactly what i want. this sounds weird for me to be saying but.... i want a kid!!"

"event","now that i sit back and look at everything we ALL are changing. sometimes i just wish everything was back to ""normal"". this isn't me. im not myself anymore. if only i could be how i was b4 when i didn't have to worry about what i looked like and what ""group"" i am classified in, in school. or how people looked at me. what happened to my innocence? what happened to the little girl i was, of course i must have grown up. but this isn't how i wanted to turn out. hardly passing my classes, skipping school, talking back to my dad, not giving a damn in general, the pot-head boyfriends.... what's the matter with me? im so scared to continue my life like this. i can just see me in a few years. not graduated, smoking. just another screw up. but that's life, and where did mine go??"

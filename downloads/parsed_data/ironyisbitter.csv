"event","oui-vey, back to school in just over a week. i almost dreaded leaving the dacks to come home and although i'm really looking forward to going back, i kinda wish i could stay at the same time. it's all just a matter of getting used to a lifestyle. is a pain and kinda awkward making the adjustment, but once ya get going you don't think much about it. now i start stressing over packing. BUT, most of my big stuff is in my storage unit in saranac so should be much eaier moving back! still super glad i took off my last week home to pack and do stuff outside with friends before leaving for another 10 months."

"event","freekin out a little, have so much to do today and leaving tomorrow to return to school. this week off was great though. with such a jam packed semester exactly half over now, this was such a nice week to recover and gear up for the second half. (as much as i'm nervous/not looking forward to it) woke up at 8:30 and was gonna lay down and doze off for a while but was too jittery and ansy to start getting ready. gotta shower, getting lunch with my mom, aunt, and two great aunts noonish, stopping at teavana to hopefully get some new teas (early bday gift), stopping at target to get random stuff i'm outta like shampoo and such for dorm room, if time allows wegmans for groceries for dorm room, windex inside of car windows, rain-x outside car windows, clean my  fan, talk to paul about summer classes, dinner at home, sabres game tonight prob with the rents. and before dark i should collect some field data i need for a lab before i go back but we'll see. now i remember why i was having a slight panic attack this morning. ok, coffee time and GO!"

"event","i can't stop thinking about skiing whiteface. this whole 5 weeks off school sucks. too much time away form the adks. i've been skiing since i was 4 years old. after skiing whiteface the handful of times i only have this year, it makes my hometown holiday valley oh so very tiny. while skiing hv with some buddies this break i realized how small it is. runs are like 30 seconds, lines for short runs, long chairlifts. whiteface is fucking heaven. i do ""bomb runs"" as fast as i can down the mountain from little whiteface and it takes me about five minutes. 2,500 vertical feet of drop. whiteface runs are so long, have many options leading to other trials, the mountain is yours. holidays gets soo boring, this dinky little runs i go straight down and barely break a sweat. i can never live away from snow and a big mountain from now on. i'm spoiled fuckin rotten with whiteface. people claim it's the best skiing in the east, now i see why. i dream of a couple weeks from now hittin the slopes.....

"event","i don't know why i have so much on my mind but so little to say. so i'll ramble. worked 1-10 today and the day went by pretty quick surprisingly. when assistant managers leave around dinner it's a carefree night from there. i read some more of the poetry life by baron wormser on my lunch and it really brought me down. i enjoy the book but man some parts really make you question your life sometimes. in a nutshell this guy's wife of 49 years died and talked about life after her. (through the book each chapter deals with a couple poems related to that short story) again, great writing i love it but was so depressing. i guess this spurred my kinda weird mood in the ladder of tonight. oh well. i'm mad at myself for not free reading much at all lately. i suck. and reading on break today was fantastic and i vow to get back into my usual reading again. i'm really annoyed with the absurd amount of people sue happy. not that this is anything new but it drives me up a wall. why do people ALWAYS go for a scapegoat? no one can take the blame or responsibility. what's the solution? sue em, why the fuck not? the women that sued over spilling her coffee on herself still blows my mind. i want to kick that cunt in the face. then pour a drum of hot coffee on her. you're stupid and deserved to burn yourself. coffee is hot, welcome to this planet. you could tell a kindergarten student this story and they will laugh at that bitch because even they would know better, that coffee is hot. or the story of the burglar sewing when he hurt himself while he broke in someone's house to rob them. that asshole should be stoned for even thinking he could sue over that. are you kidding me? i want to hit my head off a concrete wall when i hear stories like this. and the judges that grant these fucking people the money. unreal, un-freakin-real. i'm moving to the mountains to live away from any sort of population. fuck.

ten stories, two quotes i enjoyed from tonight.

you get my drift. you're always summarizing because no one wants to listen to the details. people are willing to listen some but not too much. they want an idea of what something was like that they can nod their heads to.

if you ask me, this country is group crazy. everybody has to be in a group or they're considered some weirdo who's going to shoot up the local supermarket. i don't know what's with all these groups. are we that lonely?"

"event","people blow my mind. the lack of common sense in college students blows my mind more specifically. maybe you like wasting $5,000 a semester but when the teacher asks if you have any questions before a test (which we have only 3 all year!) that doesn't mean review session. like, dude, you can't expect her to review alllllll this shit now, we've covered a month's worth of material. studying isn't cool or fun but it's part of college and unless you have a photographic memory, pretty crucial for good grades. then during the test the teacher explains a minor typo, change a few letters on the test. this chick doesn't understand, asks the teach to repeat herself. she does. then brilliance asks yet again what she said. dear god, i'm trying to think and do this test, i'm about to throw a desk at you because you can't understand a fucking thing. i'm not making fun at his stupidity like, you can't work out the quadratic formula, stupidity like don't touch the fire, it's hot! how do you people make it through college? i go in after blazing and on track for A's in all my classes. it's not rocket science, if you'd shut up and listen to the teacher you'd have A's too jackass."

"event","The first 10,000 fans at the Chicago Blackhawks' home game against the Pittsburgh Penguins last night were handed red construction hard hats with the team's famous Indian head logo. Pretty cool keepsake; too bad it was for a sport where tossing headgear onto the ice during the game is a revered tradition.

Sure enough, Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews scored what appeared to be his third consecutive goal of the game for a hat-trick in the second period, sending a swarm of construction helmets flying to the ice in celebration.

Turns out it was a case of premature hat-trick adulation. Replay officials determined that Toews's stick was above the crossbar when it touched the puck, nullifying the tally for Chicago. The reaction from the crowd says it all: Some ravenous boos before several hundred fans come to the realization that they just wasted their arena giveaway on a goal that never happened.

OK, so that was uncomfortably hilarious, in an accidently shooting the fireworks off before midnight on New Year's Eve sort of way. But what made the scene absolutely surreal was when Toews gave fans another reason to toss the helmets -- and hundreds more did just that.

Incredibly, in the third period, Toews completed his all-power-play-goal hat-trick with his 25th of the season, sending another flurry of hard hats to the ice. Pittsburgh went on to win in overtime, but they'll be talking about this scene for years.

hahaha what are the odds. 

the two ""third"" goals and a fuckload of hardhats thrown on the ice hahahaha.

"event","i dunno why i've felt the urge to post randomly more now but hey. i'm never up this early, had to drive my sister and cousin to the bus this am. passed out early last night, 11, so i do feel pretty good. besides my crazy ass dream. dude, you don't even know, this is beyond bizarre. it's the second time i've had the exact dream. again, weird. the dream starts with me with my parents and we're in the woods being hunted down. (i have a lot of dreams where people try to kill me it's not weird yet) those damn orks or however you spell em, those beasts from lord of the rings were after us. most times in these dreams i hid or book ass cause i have no weapon and 5'7"" ross ain't gonna kill an ork barehanded. wtf, i can't even dream i have like a shotgun with me. we do get away. then it cuts to me dating/living with my ex gf sarah and a few room mates in this cool house. i usually dream of exs after breaking up but not this long after, been years. then cuts back to the death section of the dream, after being chased more (now it's just me, god knows where my rents are) i come to this wicked huge cliff/edge fall down into this creek which leads into this enormous building. which i find out where ""the bad guys"" whatever they are capture everyone. then it's basically a lot of hiding and running and orks killing. it's gets a little fuzzy but was violent. some dudes had hooks instead of hands. finally the leader of the group says he's gonna let us all go but as they leave they're gonna light the building on fire, good luck getting out. this building is so jam packed with people i can't get close to exiting so i jump up on the bar and out a window eventually escaping. i run back to my home with my ex haha and she just thinks i'm being paranoid. i'm a mental case."

"event","last night i accomplished the daunting task of restoring my itunes library and ipod, all 7,700 songs. recently re-installed windows xp and started from scratch again. fuck this pc. i've had it for 5 years and i'm buying a mac when i start at PSC this fall. anyways, apple is a pain in the butt and doesn't like you taking music from ipod->pc. just mess with the folder options and allow hidden folders and transfered my 7,700 songs back to my laptop. well, external hardrive. best investment ever. feels great to have my music library back up to speed!"

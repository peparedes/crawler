--Where do I start...  Long day at work, such a long day at work, 14 hours...much too long.
<br><br>
--I've been listening to depressing songs all day...I don't really know why... I must be psychic...I'll tell you why.
<br><br>
--I talked to Sebastien today, that was fun.  **sighs**  I wish it was fun...
<br><br>
--It started out with him coming into the chat, under a name no one knew... Then when he did tell us who he was he acted like we should have known that, and got pissed because we wouldn't host him, and said ""you all can go fuck yourselves then"" and left... 
<br><br>
--Firstly, I had a feeling it was either him or Bevan...because his name had the word King in it, and his font was this but black, which immediately made me think ""sebastien""... But then his attitude made me think ""bevan""... Though neither of them were on messenger, and I checked his local time before he left and it was only an hour behind mine, which means it couldn't have been them... Then I realized that Sebastien didn't live near Bevan and Alyssa anymore... and that his time WOULD probably be an hour behind mine.  At that very moment he logged on messenger.
<br><br>
--Jokingly I said, ""Are we being bitchy today?"" and almost immediately he starts getting shitty with me... He was in a bad mood because of a few things going on, and was taking everything I said completely the wrong way... 
<br><br>
--Then he starts talking things like, ""I do care you know"" and then ""or should that be past tense"" ...then a few chats later, ""it's gone"" and ""i feel lost, i feel loves lost""... It's all a big blur... I suppose I shouldn't be so upset, considering he's probably right in saying we wouldn't make it anywhere considering we never see eachother.  
<br><br>
--Back to trying to block him out again... I don't know if I have enough will power or strength to do that again...
<br><br>
--He said he's not proud of who he is, and he hates himself, hates saying things like what he said to me... **sighs**  I wish things could be different...but they can't.  And even though I can say that...I still can't fully give up.  I suppose I'm going to have to learn how... I don't want to put words in his mouth...but I think tonite was pretty much a round-about way of saying he didn't care about me ((or at least not like I care about him)) anymore.  That makes me wonder, ""did he ever?""  I don't really know, I'd like to think at one point he did, so I will think that way...at one point...he did.  It doesn't matter anymore anyhow.
<br><br>
--Bad luck...I keep shrugging everything off as coincidence...""just a long stream of bad luck""... bullshit, once there's a major sum of coincidences, you can't consider them coincidence anymore..."

I can't remember if I've ever said anything in here about how many of my close friends have died.  I'm not about to go rummaging through my entries to check.  
<br><br>
I'm 19, and in my 19 years, I've had 22 close friends die...as of last nite, that number increased by two.
<br><br>
My best friend died when we were both 12, then, in the year 1999, 19 of my friends died.  How does that happen?  I don't know...I ask myself that everyday.  
<br><br>
I watched three of them die...one took a shot gun blast to the head, suicide... Another was murdered, hand gun... And the last, jumped 16 floors off his balcony, suicide.
<br><br>
Last nite...two close friends died in a car accident.  One of them, Mike, was one of my best friends through highschool...then, last summer, right before he was supposed to be a senior and graduate, he was trapped in a fire in his house...his friends got him out in time, but not before more then half his body had 3rd degree burns.  He had to listen to his mom and dad's screams until they died in that fire.  He went through a year of rehabilitation in the hospital, graphing, and more graphing...alot of pain, and alot of morphine.  He finally got out a few months ago.  He had a lot of money from the insurance...he bought a new car, a new dirtbike, and still had a lot of money left over...but nothing could ever fill the void where his parents once were.  With the help of a certain bitch ((who will remain nameless...mostly because it won't matter soon, I'm going to kill her)) he turned to heroin.  I didn't find this out until this past weekend, whereas today, I was planning on going to see him, and try to talk some sense into him.  A day too late... 
<br><br>
Him...and his cousin, Eddie, another very good friend of mine...were drunk, and heavily drugged up, flying down a back road that was very windy and had quite a few dips in it, that could be turned very easily into jumps ((ramps)) if going at a high enough speed.  Eddie owned an old and very fast Camaro.  The car flew over 20 feet before smashing into an embankment, and driving straight into it, leaving almost a 5 foot gouge.  The police man first at the scene ((who's a good friend of my father)) said it was like a bloody massacre.  There was nothing left of the car, and blood everywhere.  
<br><br>
For the past six hours I've felt nothing but anger...I can't cry, I can only shake with rage.  How does this keep happening?  Why?  When is it going to stop?  And the most plaguing question, why didn't I go see Mike yesterday instead of waiting until it was too late...
<br><br>
I can't imagine never seeing Eddie again...his girlfriend just had a baby not too long ago.  Eddie and I have been friends since we were 13, we always fought, but we were so close.  He was like a big brother to me...  I remember one nite...I was drunk, and highly upset at an ex of mine.  He had cheated on me, and I felt worthless and ugly.  Eddie stayed with me most of the nite, and I remember before he left, he kissed me on the forehead, and leaned over to whisper in my ear, ""You're beautiful...look at you...look at your eyes, you have the most amazing eyes.""  He wrapped his arms around me before finishing with, ""You're perfect to me.""  Eddie was usually not at all sympathetic or sensitive.  He hid from that, he was a very sensitive person, but even to me, he never showed it.  But that nite...he did.  He even told me he loved me that nite.  He never even told his girlfriend ((who he was IN love with)) that he loved her...I hope he did at one point, because now...he won't ever have another chance.  I haven't talked to her yet...I don't want to, as horrible as that sounds.  
<br><br>
I can't feel anything but rage anymore...I can't talk to anyone about it.  I can't think about anything else.  Things make less and less sense to me every minute that goes by...everything seems so pointless anymore.

Did you ever notice how difficult it is to NOT make yourself believe what you want to believe, as opposed to believing what is true?
<br><br>
I guess in a way, it's easier to keep lieing to yourself ... But on the other hand, doesn't it just hurt 10 times more when you realize the truth later then sooner?
<br><br>
Damon's on vacation ... I wish he'd call.
<br><br>
Precious and a few of his friends did a ""Jackass"" kind of stupid stunt movie last nite ... I wish I could have been there, that would have been great.
<br><br>
I emailed Adam, apologizing ... I know I shouldn't have, it really isn't my fault that I felt like I did ... But I don't even think he remembers that nite, so I figure it would be easier just to forget it ... See?  There I go again with the easy route.  You'd think I'd learn.  I know it'll just happen again ...and I'll make myself forget it without saying anything again...and again...and again.
<br><br>
Life's so redundant."

I love looking around my room for something to give me thought on what to subject my entries ... ~laughs~
<br><br>
Have I said yet that I HATE men?  Why don't they understand ANYTHING??  For example, Adam, I don't particularly like when he's drinking, because he gives me the impression that he doesn't know when it's time to quit...and the littlest things get him depressed/upset.  And it's bad enough when he's upset sober, but when he's upset drunk...that's a whole new story. ((ie: taking a lot of pills)).  I remember one time talking to Cory ((his friend)) on the phone the morning after Adam and a few other friends got ""wasted""...and apparently Adam got upset over something and practically OD'd on pills.  ~sighs~  I almost feel bad for getting pissed off about it...I've done the same thing before.  But it's different with him, I CARE about him, and I don't want to see him getting hurt.
<br><br>
I guess I'm a hypocrite, uh?  Oh well ... I don't think he has any idea I'm mad at him, even though the nite before last when he was drunk I was a complete bitch ... He probably doesn't remember it now.
<br><br>
I don't even know that I'm actually ""mad"" at him ... Just more upset, I think ... I guess it doesn't matter ... Sometimes I wonder how much he cares, being so far away and all, and seeing as I've been fucked over before in almost all my relationships ((especially online ones)) I have a tendency to be paranoid and doubt someones feelings for me, especially online ... I guess I'm just frustrated about the whole thing, period ... I wish he was here, and that makes me mad, so every little thing that happens makes me 10 times more angry just because I'm already angry at him not being here ... Not angry at him though, just angry in general, it's not his fault he can't be here.
<br><br>
Blah, I took some Vicks 44M cough syrup, I feel nauseated now.  ~gags~

Seems nobody's been writing much in their diary's on here lately ... 
<br><br>
I wrote to ""Seb"" ~giggles quietly to herself at that abbreviation~  today, haven't talked to him in months, I'm glad he's okay ... I hope he writes back.
<br><br>
If he reads that at any time I'm sure I'll get yelled at ... I love you too, sweetie.  ~laughs hard~
<br><br>
I feel so out of it lately, spacy almost ... Oh well, I'm sure it will pass.
<br><br>
I talked to Adam today on the phone too ... He's such a sweetheart ... He played guitar for me. ~drools~  I have such a weakness for that, if a man sings or plays guitar (or both, oh wow, that would be bad) I'm immediatly at his every whim ... ~laughs~  What an idiot I am ...
<br><br>
Chels, if you read this, sucks that we got cut off on messenger ~kicks a chihuahua for that~ and I can't get into your diary!  That site takes forever sometimes!  Must be the server, probably maxed out ... Weird too, because I have a cable connection, it's always fast.

What a lie ... 
<br><br>
I wish everything was as perfect as I want it to be ... Stupid wish, I know...but sometimes you need wishful thinking to go on with your life ... I won't explain that ...
<br><br>
I guess Damon's right, I do live in a fairy tale, as far as what's going on in my head at least ... Outside that, it's a nitemare ... I'm perfectly content living in my non-reality ...
<br><br>
The temptation can be so strong at times, but then when I try to get there, I can't enjoy it ... That probably won't make any sense, and if it does it probably won't be taken the way I meant it ... But who cares?  Don't we love to leave things to think that they meant the way WE wanted it to mean ... Even if it's completely wrong ... Don't we all only hear what we want to hear?  I wish I did ...
<br><br>
I could only hope to be so ignorant to the ""real"" ... I could only hope to be so numb ... Hoping gets you nowhere ...
<br><br>
If you take action, does it matter?  Will it matter when only a handful know you exist?  Does it even matter to them??  If you want my opinion, no ... If someone only remembers something for a period of time, and not for the rest of their lives, then it doesn't matter ... And who remembers something for the rest of their life??
<br><br>
I guess I could run...but even that would take motivation, and who has the energy for that...

I heard from J today, he said he won't be emailing again until this is all over, but to let me know that he's not in harms way, and that he'll be fine, and that he loves me and will talk to me ""soon"" ... **sighs**  I hope he's right.
<br><br>
I miss precious, I don't talk to him much anymore ... I miss Adam too, he emailed today, I guess I'm going to have to get use to the fact that he is in fact still with his girlfriend, I love Adam, but mostly as just a best friend, and sometimes best friends can get jealous...I know.

I went to blockbuster today ... Bought three movies and rented one, I'm trying to keep my mind off J and all my other friends who are in the military ... I ended up buying ""The Mexican"" (Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt), ""Being John Malkovich"", and ""The Shawshank Redmeption"" ... I've seen Shawshank, but not the other two, I hope I'm not disappointed considering I bought them, oh well, I have a 30 day guarantee ... I rented ""Bootmen"" (Adam Garcia), I've never seen it previewed, but from the looks of the back of the case it almost looks like a different version of ""Stomp"" if you've ever seen that...I love Adam Garcia, but he's such an asshole, oh well, good to the eyes **chuckles** 
<br><br>
I wish they would have had ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" there to buy instead of just to rent, that movie's the best if you want to keep your mind off things...so funny.
<br><br>
Well, I don't know what else to write, I still haven't heard from J, and probably won't now...until this is all over, god I hope that's soon.
<br><br>
I've been chain-smoking constantly today, and if that's not bad enough I went back to Marlboro Reds from my Lights, oh well, I guess it's better then going back to Newport 100's.
<br><br>
I always feel like I'm whining/bitching too much when I write in here...but then I have to remind myself, that's pretty much what it's here for.

well, it just seems like a whole new world now, doesn't it??    i don't know, it all seems so odd  ...  i spoke to j today, apparently if we go to war he'll be going  ...  i was hoping with him being stationed in another country and all he wouldn't have to go  ...  i know, ridiculous, but it's wishful thinking  ...  i think we will go to war, most definitely  ...  i hope we don't though, i hope we just bomb the bastards and get it over with, technically, it's not really war if we just nuke them all, they won't have a chance to fight back...they don't deserve one anyway.
<br><br>
i don't have much to say tonite, getting that email from j kind of spoiled my nite.

on the other hand, i do have really good news...my cousin finally called us, stupid fuck, he was ""busy"" so he didn't get a chance to call  ...  how horrible is that??    he wasn't on the plane even though he was scheduled for it, like my uncle and the rest of us had hoped, they backed out on him at the last minute and he didn't go  ...  bah, he's such a retard, my cousin, that just pissed me off, making us all cry and worry for nothing  ...  he's so selfish.

the press is calling all this ""attack on america"" - couldn't we have thought of something a little better??
<br><br>
tuesday's date was 9-11 - how nice
<br><br>
alot of people are referring back to a nostradamus prophecy about these attacks - i thought i was the only one who still read his work
<br><br>
comments from a meeting for the defense chairman:
<br>
""this <u>is</u> war, we <u>must</u> retaliate""
<br>
""to our (americas) enemies; we are coming...god will give you mercy...we will not""
<br>
""bomb the hell out of them...they certainly found our american civilians expendable...so be it""
<br><br>
that's all for now ... i have to go to work ... see you when i get home

some last thoughts after getting out of the shower and while getting ready for bed:
<br><br>
i saw pictures today of the leader of palestine donating blood - did we actually accept that??
<br><br>
i saw a picture of a sign on a restaurant that said ""president bush, declare <u>war</u> on afghanistan tonight!"" - why didn't we??
<br><br>
i saw an interview with an arab (prior to the attacks), he said something to the affect of, ""you people (america) send missles around not thinking first, that is pure cowardness...you can't expect us (arabs) to do something that cowardly"" - HA!
<br><br>
assuming there was 24 high-jackers involved, on 4 jumbo planes that held anywhere from 34-90 people on them, and all the high-jackers had was pepper spray and knives ... now yes, they told them there was a bomb on the plane, and yes, i'm sure they told them if they were ""good"" then they wouldn't get hurt ... and yes, alot of planes get high-jacked, and most of the time there's negotiation and the plane lands safely - BUT! if you had 3-6 ARABS high-jacking your plane with only knives and pepper spray, wouldn't you stop for at least two seconds to think, ""okay...when has the arabs ever wanted to negotiate anything??""
<br><br>
fidel castro ""urges"" america to remain ""calm"" - sure...as soon as we get rid of all you stupid fucks we'll be calm
<br><br>
afghanistan ""warns"" america NOT to retaliate against them - all the more reason TO retaliate
<br><br>
i'm sure i'll think of more things when i lay down to go to sleep, if i remember them by morning, i'll post them
<br>
goodnite

well, they just released new footage of the second plane crashing into the second tower of the world trade centre ... the first, original, footage you couldn't really see the plane actually colliding with the building because it was taken on the other side of the building from where the plane hit ... this  new footage (taken by an ""amateur"") shows, very clearly, the plane colliding with the building, it also has audio...people screaming.  **shivers and blinks back the tears**  i just can't stand all this ... i know that bombing all those countrys that i've been talking about isn't going to take a way the pictures i keep seeing in my head, everytime i close my eyes...the screams i hear everytime i turn off the lights to fall asleep ... but it has to be done, justice has to come, and revenge has to be taken ... not just to get back at them for taking so many lives...but to insure this doesn't happen again ... also, answer some questions...how did those people get on those planes with guns/knives/bombs??  there's so many questions, but that one seems to stick with me at all times.

<br><br>
now they're saying the plane that hit the pentagon was actually headed for the white house/airforce one ... but for some reason (probably because nobody was at the white house and airforce one was in florida) they veered off and hit the pentagon ... </font>

<font face=""copperplate gothic bold"" color=""red"" size=3>my brother and i got into it today ... sometimes i'd love to strangle him ... i can't wait to get a lap-top, all he ever wants is the computer ... 
<br><br>
besides that, i guess everythings alright ... i feel like shit today, and i didn't go to work...again.  i was supposed to go in tonite, but seeing as all the airports were shut down, there was nothing for me to do ... god damn asshole arabs.
<br><br>
i saw and heard from alot of ""bleeding hearts"" today ... to hell with all of you ... if you care so much, then YOU go to afghanistan and we'll bomb you with the rest of those fucks ... it's sad it has to come to this, all this violence and death, but we didn't start this ... bin laden made a written statement, ""i had nothing to do with these attacks, but i do encourage it"" GO TO HELL ... why didn't we kill him?? HE'S the one that bombed the world trade centre in '93!  why the FUCK didn't we kill him?? he also said in that statement, ""when all the palestinians were killed, america was silent"" ... WE didn't kill them ... this is different, THEY killed us, they need to die ... all those countrys, they all need a fatal lesson ... when those palestinians were killed, did you see US cheering in the streets?? did you see US dancing and parading around like mardi gras?? no...but when we died, who was?? the palestinians...bullshit...kill them all.  now when i say kill them all, i mean bomb their country, i don't mean kill the ones that have come to america to escape their aweful government, they're good, they need to stay.

i'm still listening to that opeth song, i can't stop, i'm addicted, great.
<br>
i'm going to attempt not to think about the attack we had earlier anymore, i'm going to go about my life and act like nothing happened ... right, like i won't be reminded of it everytime i turn on the TV, or the radio, or walk past two people talking (because you know they'll be talking about it) ... i think my cousin will call, i don't think he was on that plane, just keep telling yourself that.

<font face=""copperplate gothic bold"" color=""red"" size=3>i'm sure you've all heard by now of the nation-wide attack we (america) was under today ... i'd like to inform everyone of what i've heard so far ... there were four planes high-jacked this morning ... the first one, flew full force into one of the twin towers of the world trade centre in new york ... 15 minutes later, a second plane flew full force into the other twin tower ... 30 minutes later, both towers had collapsed ... another 30 minutes later, a third high-jacked plane flew full force into the army side of the pentagon ... 5 minutes later, the fourth plane went down in an old deserted mining strip near where i work, outside of pittsburgh ... it's said that the pilot of the fourth plane was not a terrorist, but an actual pilot, with a gun pointed at his head ... supposedly he banked the aircraft to the right, and then turned the engines full throddle, straight into the ground ... he saved the lives of many people, that plane was headed for camp david ... it's said that the third plane that flew into the pentagon was also flown by a pilot at gun-point, apparently right before he was about to hit the pentagon, he tried to drive it into the ground, unfortunately from where the plane took off, to the pentagon, there wasn't a place like the old strip mines that he could crash it and save lives, so he tried his best ... 
<br>
i just got news from my uncle...apparently my cousin was supposed to be on the plane from boston en route to LA ...the same one that slammed into the north tower of the world trade centre.  my uncle's hoping, ""you know he does this a lot...saying he's going somewhere for a business meeting, and it ends up they cancel on him and he doesn't go"" ...but why hadn't he called to say he's all right...why hasn't he answered the phone... it just came over the news that they believe now that they didn't high-jack the planes by gun-point...but with knives... four planes, anywhere from 30-80 people on each, and they only had knives??  why didn't someone stop them?? why didn't the people on the plane grab them?? i have a hard time believing all this tragedy and death, was caused by a bunch of towel-heads carrying only knives... i'm sorry for using such a harsh term, and for even assuming it was the arabs, but how could you not at this point??  i'm not a prejudice person, but these countrys, afghanistan, palestine, libia...they were cheering when they found out what happened, cheering and parading around in the streets, clapping with big smiles on their faces...even the children ...they were handing out candy like it was some holiday, dancing around, happy...happy because thousands of innocent people have died... bomb them all, i don't care if they did it or not, they're a waste, nuke them... we can't stand by and let this happen again, because nobody can deny, this isn't just a little ""terrorist party""... this is war... and it's not over yet... why should we let them kill more people??  they have evidence that there's definitely A government involved from another country...i say nuke all those little shit country's, wastes of flesh, wastes of space, get rid of them... ""but what about the women and children??"" ...what ABOUT the women and children??  fuck the women and children, they were parading around dancing on the streets just like the men were..and those children are going to grow up to be just like those ADULTS that were cheering because of all those people dieing, innocent people that they don't even know...that they never will know now ... 
<br>
all this is just random thoughts, i'm so unbelievably pissed off at this, and probably will remain pissed off... they say somebody's bombing afghanistan, but it's not us... why isn't it??  why aren't we DOING something??  there's also news that the fourth plane was shot down by our f-16's...that the pilot didn't intentionally drive it into the ground...if that's the case, that's all right...i won't argue that...yes, 34 people were on that plane, they all died, but if that plane would have made it to camp david, a lot MORE people would have died... i don't, however, agree with them hiding it...a woman claims she saw the f-16, that's the only ""evidence"" we have that it was shot down...all other evidence points to the pilot flying it into the ground, if i had to chose, i would pick the latter, i'd rather have the heroic pilot then the f-16's, i can't really explain why...maybe because i feel like this all isn't real, it all seems like a bad movie to me, and there's always hero's in bad movies, and usually, they don't come in big fighter jets... yes, i think i'll stick to my movie, and pretend this all isn't real...</font>

<font face=""copperplate gothic light"" color=""white"" size=3>Mawahahaha...I FINALLY get to speak on my own...and use a tre cool font, heh heh heh.  I'm not really Bain's conscience...if you haven't figured that out already, I'm actually a friend of hers, who's ALWAYS raiding her fridge.  I write the ""techy"" background music for her upcoming songs, she plays some (notice I said some) guitar, and sings...she has a beautiful voice, don't tell her I said that though.  I use to play guitar, but I injured my hand, so now I just write techno.  There really isn't a name for the ""band"" we have yet (if you could even call it a band), and we haven't had any gigs, we're not ready for any of that yet, we're mostly just fucking around right now (not like THAT heh though sometimes I wish, have you ever seen Bain?!)  Ryan used to do lead guitar until he left to go to school, college, whatthefuckever (yes I'm bitter)...and Mark is sort of like the manager, and he mixes a bit, mostly drumming.  Ever since I moved out by Phili, Bain and I never get to see each other much, we talk on the phone a lot (all except for the last two weeks that she was ignoring me...thanks Bain, I love you too) I'm hopefully going to get down there soon, it's hard working on music being across the state from each other.  All right, I'm going to go because she's bitching...

I hope I did this HTML thingy right...duh.

all right, so i took a break, and now i'm in a different mood, you'll see that a lot throughout this journal of mine ... i'll switch moods pretty quick, because i'll stop writing and then start up again, and by then i'll be in a different mood ... I TALKED TO ADAM!!! YAY!!! **laughs** i love adam, he's such a sweetheart, i just wish he didn't live so far away, we'd be such good friends, not that we aren't now, but you know... adam lives in california (or as kid rock would say, ""cali-forn-eye-a"") ... he plays guitar and sings, he's in a band, and he just informed me that he got some stuff recorded (he was in san diego for a week, i missed him soo much) so he'll be able to send me some music from his band soon ... **is so excited**  i also talked to gabriel (i call him gabe) he's from texas, we always swap music (not mainstream but local-like music that pretty much only a handful of people from state to state, if even that, have heard of)...he told me about this band, ""opeth"" i really don't care for a lot of their music because a lot of it's like growling/screaming, even though the actual music (ie: guitar, drums, etc) is good ... but there's two songs on their new album ""blackwater park"" that i REALLY like, one's called ""the drapery falls"" and one's called ""harvest"" (""harvest"" is my absolute favourite), they're not really screaming/growling in those two songs ... then adam of course LOVES ""the misfits"" ... so he's been telling me a bunch of songs by them to listen to (ie: ""we bite"", ""halloween"", ""last caress"") they're pretty good, but i think if it were anyone else that recommended them to me, i probably wouldn't like them ... **laughs** it's just a thing with adam, if it has to do with him, i'll probably like it.

"event","puppet angel is SOOOOO cute!!! I also LOVE the prine of lies. (i know different angel episodes). I truly almost cried at the end of the ""smile time"" episode 'cause of the fesley action. BRING BACK FUNN!!!!!!!!! Next week just pisses me off because of the whole fesley thing, but i'll watch it and get really pissed and cry myself a river. Anyways its super obvious what will happen at the end of the episode 'cause certain people can't die 'cause of certain contracts. I drove by sunnydale today for like the billionth time but i am just as excited each time.

"event","I just thought I should update this journal since it's been so long. I'm in college again for my second semester in a row and I'm still loving every minute of it! I arranged my schedule the way ""I"" like it by only having to go twice a week. I'm taking 3 internet classes, too. On my first test of the semester I made a perfect 100% so I'm pretty excited about that; I was surprised when I got that email. I figured I'd make at least an A, but 100 is even better! :D

My brother got a Jack Russell Terrior for his birthday a couple of months back. He decided to name him Moose. It's different and unusual so I like it. Moose is almost completely white and has hair sticking up all over the place. The cutest thing he does is whine and kick in his sleep. It's pretty funny. All is quiet in the house and then all of a sudden you here this commotion but can't figure out where it's coming from and then it dawns on you... Oh, it's the dog! He's silly. :P

I've got some new friends, too! Shout outs to Shane and Esteban!!! They are both awesome guys with the type of personalities you can't help but just love to death! :D Oh, speaking of friends... that's my New Year's Resolution: To make more friends. And not just friends, but close friends! This is my first year ever to actually have a resolution for the year, but I'm gonna stick with this one! I need more support badly right now!

But I'll let everyone go now that I've wrote another book here.

Take care everyone! Lata!"

"event","Welp, there's no one online at the moment.... therefore, i'm bored to death. I've been buried in my college work alot lately. So when I get online, all I wanna do is talk to my boyfriend and buddies.

I don't have much to report except that the end of the semester is near. The end of my first semester of college. 5 years ago I never thought I would reach this point... I'm so glad I have. So glad I have made it this far. I wouldn't go back in time 5 years ago for anything. High school was the worst time in my life, especially from the seventh thru about maybe tenth grade. I had no good friends, no friends of worth anywayz. The few I did have, I couldn't tell things, like secrets, or I woulda had a worser time in high school. About the end of tenth grade, I was saved. Trish came into my life. I never knew what the true meaning of friends was 'til I met her, cuz I had never had one before her. The so called ""best friends"" I had in the past all treated me like trash, and when it came to becoming popular, they would make fun of me out in the open so they could be in the ""in crowd"". I hate them for that.

I guess it did make me a stronger person, but I wouldn't go thru that ever again, even if my life depended on it. Those so called ""human beings"" are one of the reasons I'm hesitant about bringing a child of my own out into this world. I wouldn't want them to go thru that, or even be the ones that bring that upon someone else.

On another note, today I registered for my classes for next semester. I'm excited about taking different courses and seeing more new people. And besides, after next semester, I will have my first year of college done. My first year... of college! I love college, and it goes by so much faster than high school ever did. I really wish it was the other way around: high school would fly by and feel like 1 year passing just within a few days and college lasting as long as high school did. Anywayz, this entry is long enough and I'll have plenty more future entries to piece my life story together with later on.

Later people. Take care.

"event","Yet again, I have procrastinated with my homework way too long. I meant to do it Friday. *ha ha like that woulda happened* So I'm stuck doing it today instead. And last nite I was gonna do my homework, but my Pete came online and I had to talk to him. I miss him loads when I don't get to talk to him. He's had a bad week, so I had to cheer him up. I made him laugh and that means more than anything. So I think I made his day a lot better. I know he made mine a lot better. I've had sort of a bad week, too, but not as bad as he had. His brother, Tony, is going to be visiting him next month, and I think I'll get to talk to him more. That'll be kool. Maybe I can talk him into buying me a laptop. *ha ha*

There was a wreck right by my house this morning. A classmate of mine, his brother was involved in it, but I think everyone is okay. It wasn't near as bad as some head on collisions are, although both of the vehicles were totaled.

My new goal for this week is to work out. I'm planning on doing it Tuesday. I told Pete about it last nite and he laughed and said I wouldn't ever do it. (He's used to me saying that I'm gonna work out and I never get around to it.) But I'm gonna prove him wrong this time. I'm gonna work out just cuz he said I wouldn't work out. Watch out, Pete. :P

Anywayz, I better get on this homework or I'll be super rushed tonite.

Lata

"event","Welp, I got some time to do nothing so I thought I'd write in here some.

Last nite before I left for my nite class, an old friend showed up at my door. Matt had seen my truck parked out front with the ""For Sale"" sign on it and was thinkin about buying it. We talked for a few mins about stuff and we both decided that we'd try doing something together again. We wanted to before we graduated, but things worked out (naturally) to where we couldn't. I think the one weekend he was free, I had a date (for the first time in my life) but afterwards I think I woulda rather been hangin with Matt that nite. So he said he'd call me sometime so we could discuss where we wanna go and what we wanna do together. I won't keep my hopes up too high. Guys in the past haven't done what they've said they'd do for me (including returning phone calls and taking me out somewhere), but maybe Matt will be different (hopefully).

I haven't talked to Pete all week and I'm trying my best not to get worried about him. He does get so busy sometimes that he can't get online at all, so I hope that's what's up. I last talked to him Sunday nite and when I was asleep that nite I jumped almost straight up in bed for no reason that I knew of. I've heard that things like that happens when something bad happens to someone you really love (hopefully that wasn't the case for me). I miss him loads tho, so I hope all is well with him.

The last couple of days I've felt a little bad, like I'm trying to get sick or something. My hand is aching bad, and I usually ache in weird places when I get sick. Sometimes my skin even hurts... I dunno if anyone knows what that feels like, but it's not something you wanna go through too many times at once. It feels like your body is literally falling apart.

Anywayz, lata ppl

"event","This morning in speech class we got to act out a trial. Nikki had been accused of stealing a car and I was her lawyer. Being a hug fan of detective movies/shows, I was pretty thrilled to be in the lawyer position. In real life, I'd hate to be a lawyer cuz with my luck I'd be one of the unfortunate lawyers that make someone mad and something bad happens as the result. *ha ha* It was fun for play tho. I woulda been a dang lot better lawyer if we coulda had a weekend to think things out tho, but I did good for 10 mins preparation. :D

In Biology, we've been studying about chromosomes and today we all got to pair up some chromosomes and find the X and Y (X and X in my case since I got a female's chromosomes). For those of you who don't have a clue about what I'm talkin about... to put it plainly, chromosomes are what make you a guy or girl. The female will alwayz have an X and whenever she is fertilized, the male will give her either an X or a Y. The X will make the offspring female and the Y will make it a male. So there's your science lesson for the day. And to all you men out there who blame women for not giving you the offspring you want.... It's actually your fault, so HAH! :P

Yesterday I chatted with Patrick some. He was obviously bored if he talked to me. Just kiddin P. ;) P is kool. We chat about anything and everything. And for any girl who gets a hold of him, way to go! :P (I figured it'd be kool if you saw your name in my journal, P) :P

Dude I got a book goin here. One last thing... if Ivan happens to read this.. you're a kool dude, too. :P Thanks for being such a sweetie.

"event","I feel a lot better today. Depression is a thing I go through every once in a while. I'm weird. *lol* Haven't talked to my baby yet today. I'm sure he was alil worried about me last nite, but that's just cuz he loves me so much. :D I also talked to El last nite. I'm sure he was worried alil, too. I'm fine though ever-body! :D

I got the results back today from my Biology test last Wednesday... I aced that one too! :D I will probly come out with a B average in that class. Rock! As for my other classes, Speech is doing okay, I just have a problem with the whole ""speech giving"" part of it. *coughs* Algebra is easy! (I say that now, but I'll wind up flunking it out now that I have said it. ha!) Comp I is pretty easy. All I really gotta do is type out a few small papers and be there for class. (not exaggerating with the ""small"" part, they really are small papers = 500 words) I'll get to register for the spring semester sometime the middle of this month, which I really can't wait for. My tuition is being fully paid for so it's very kool.

My only big problem next will be getting a job. *bites nails* And on top of everything I think I have switched career plans already. Instead of kindergarten teaching, I think I'm leaning more towards high school counseling. Why? cuz I think I could do a better job than some of the counselors around here. *ahem* *directed towards my old high school counselor*

Anywayz! I'll let everyone recover from this novel I wrote for some reason.

"event","Welp, it's another day. I woke up with a headache... not a real bad one, but the kind that are just enough to make you feel completely bad all over. My Pete is the best medicine for anything like that though (including horrible headaches).

Right now, my pet bird, Rocky, is crawling all over me. He's 5 months old and has the most hyperactive personality of anyone I know... maybe except for Eric *lol* just kiddin, skinnaaay. *winks* Rocky pouts when he doesn't get the attention he wants and fusses at whomever touches him, except for me. He hates my little brother. I keep telling him if he wants Rocky to like him, he should quit scaring him with every object available to him... but I guess he'll learn with the next pet. *ha*

Anywayz, I think I shall retire from this journal for a while. Today there has to be some homework done sometime soon. *coughs* I love college except for the whole homework part, but oh well. Later ppl

"event","Today was kinda boring. I got up alil before noon and then the electricity decided to go out ...why? I dunno. I never ate lunch, which I don't need to get into that habit since I'm already small enough. After the lights finally came back on *around 2:30* I got online and chatted with my Pete for a few hours and then had to get off to do some chores. And now it's almost 1 in the morning and I'm not real tired, but I'm bored. *lol*

On another note... I looked at the calendar earlier today and under October 19th it said ""Sweetest Day"" ....Does anyone know what that means? I didn't even know such a day existed where everything on this earth was ""sweet"". I think that's pretty exaggerated and makes no sense what so ever.

Anywayz... Goodnight to all, I must get busy dreaming of my wonderful boyfriend. :D

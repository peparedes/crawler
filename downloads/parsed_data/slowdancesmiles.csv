"event","maybe it is just me, but more than likely it is my emotions. i can't handle these instabilities and misunderstandings. my troubles come at me in some unexpected and interesting ways that i now can no longer control. i'm ready to go, i'm ready to leave anything and anyone. as cold as that sounds, i just don't care. i only wish magic fingers could snap and make everything better but unfortunately that is not the case. i miss what i used to have, but rather than seek out something better i settle for what is given, and i deal. these troubles are my own fault because of my insecurities. most of my troubles are from that and so i am not angry anymore. i do hope for something better and wish that i would try to change the present but instead i simply give up and once again, deal. understand that i am nothing more than a scared, insecure person down deep; as much as i say i have grown up over the years i really have only stayed more of the same. in fact that is what we all are, more of the same that we always were. we don't grow up but rather just choose to express a different part of the same person. for me that is insecurity, it's the reason i try to run away,. it is the reason i haven't ever kept in touch with past friends: i am afraid of what might happen. yes, i may be happily surprised but that happiness could also be rejection, and it is that that i fear. dreams are nothing more than lies to get you through the night as to make the morning seem hopeful, i only wish this was the case. i've always tried to simply survive and that is what i plan on doing no matter what the consequences are...

it has been a pleasure."

it's just a little over a month until i leave and in some ways i wish i moved tomorrow. sometimes waiting is the worst and unanswered questions only make the problem overwhelming. if i don't get the chance to thank you all personally before i leave, let me just say that you have all contributed to the person i am today. i've grown up a lot here. i've learned and experienced many things while getting to know each and everyone of you so it is bittersweet to think that i'll be leaving. thank you all, but hopefully i'll get to tell you this in person."

"event","recently i have been trying so hard to put what is going on in my life
into words, but so many times i have failed. After much thought, after
much deliberation this is what i have come up with....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for once in my life there is not going to be another
chance. i'll never again do the things i've done as a child, i'm
growing up- a harsh reality. i've always been able to put things off
until another day but now i can't.&nbsp; no more putting off things
until tomorrow or until i <span style=""font-style: italic;"">feel</span>
like it, because those chances are almost over. all my life my parents
have told me to cherish whatever it is that i was doing at the time,
and i always responded by thinking <span style=""font-style: italic;"">that i always will be able to do this</span>.
But now, i can't. there are so many things that i am missing right now
that i won't do again. Wisdom really does come with age, and maybe if i
was a little wiser i would have listened to my parents when i was
younger. there are things that i can't do anymore, because of my knee,
because of money, or just because it simply isn't there. either way it
ends, and that dead end is a scary reality that is quickly approaching.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as i say i want out of here, as much as i
want out of this hell we know as high school - i am simply not ready.
The world is a scary place that i am not even close to being ready for.
But for some unknown reason when high school ends they throw you in the
pool in some grand sink or swim experiment of life. I only hope that i
know how to swim, because i'm not ready for this. i've been protected
all my life by so many things: friends, family, church, school, and
myself. i have always tried to keep myself isolated because it is safe
and protected. Now, i will leave this protection and see how well i can
survive. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my house went on the market two days ago and now the
end is truely in sight. i have moved many times before in my life, but
none seem to bother me as much as this one and the only difference is
this is the last one. Before i always expected to move again, and there
is comfort in that, but now i am not going to move again and so this is
the end. There is no way out and i am stuck. Not to mention the fact
that i am moving to a place where i won't be able to make new
connections very easily. i will come home from college and work, that
is all - nothing more, nothing less. i don't like the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  ....i hope this makes sense, because it doesn't to me<br>

"event","Newton was mostly right, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. What he forgot is that in many cases the reaction can be greater than the original action. 
It's a known fact that the choices we make, the words we say, the looks we give all somehow have a consequence. We would like to believe we are free to do whatever we want, but we are not. The things that we do or don't do always either make the situation better or worse for someone and as a consequence we must always be thinking of others. Life's decisions are like a teeter totter that swings back and forth trying to find a balance. In someway our actions become personal and are an attack in some shape. Even though the intentions were good, people are not mind readers and consequently can't understand those intentions. Rather, they just see what happened (or in most cases what didn't happen) to them and react emotionally. You must understand that to them they are the most important thing, just like your actions are the most important to you. 
Understand that life isn't about you. You really aren't that special in the whole scheme of things and consequently have to get over yourself.The troubles comes from when on either end of the problem the person is only thinking about themselves. The moment you forget that there are other people out there is when one of them slaps you in the face. 
You don't always get what you want, and that is ok. Life is too big and to overwhelming to be so childish forever. You can't be so childish as to believe your actions aren't going to have consequences, but you also can't let everything be so personal. Learn from it and move on...."

But, please. It's still hard for me to have a clear mind thinking on it. But it's the truth even if it didn't happen...  



  ...what does it matter anyways, all i seem to worry about now is myself. i have become more selfish and childish than i could ever imagine. my thoughts, worries, concerns, troubles, problems, and anger are all a result of my own actions and yet i try to blame it on others. in my attempts to find help, i end up pushing those who matter away from me. i swear i am trying to learn, and that i understand i step over the line sometimes. why won't someone just tell me to stop..."

"event","today is one of those days when i just want to crawl back under the covers and feel the warmth and peace of rest...

contradictions surround me, and have even become me lately. i can't seem to escape these simple troubles that haunt my every waking hour. at the moment i should be happy, i should be proud, i should be excited and pleased..... but i don't think i could be anymore the opposite direction. i understand that this is for the good, i know that, but for some reason i just don't believe it. i've seen more friends in the past weeks then all summer, but i couldn't feel anymore alone right now. 

maybe i just want to feel unique, maybe i just want to feel special, but what does that matter... what good am i alone? i haven't quite given up yet, but i am close. i often think about what it was like to be alone.... isolation isn't so bad, at least then you don't have any hopes to have destroyed, every moment is a surprise and often is a good one. 

i apologize....."

i have a bad habit, i tend to worry too much. but if this has taught me anything it is that worries honestly mean nothing at all. you are so concerned at one moment over one action when you fail to see the thousands of other actions that go on everyday around you. be grateful for the things that do go right instead of focusing upon the couple of problems in your life. this was poorly written i apologize..."

"event","these past couple of weeks i wish i could take back. i have been given great opportunities but have thrown them away on account of my own worthless troubles. i realized that many of my own complaints are nothing more than about problems that i have created. these are my problems from the beginning and i haven't bothered to deal with them, i have a lot of thinking to do....

"event","men only think about death right before they die, as if searching for some proof that they have actually lived.


sometimes i wonder if it is worth it: the goals i set, the accomplishments i have, the words i write, the things i say.... do they mean anything? i personally believe that what we accomplish on our own tends to mean nothing, everything under the sun is meaningless, but yet we still put such emphasis upon what we have done. the trophies we win, respect we earn, encouragement we receive all in reality mean nothing because we are nothing more than ashes and dust. however, to therefor dismiss all passion is just as futile and meaningless too. it is a vicious cycle...
 i guess all i want to see is if i have ever really done something, if i have ever left a mark, if i have ever really done something to be proud of... as egotistical of a comment as that is i just want to find out if all this is worth it. if this year will be worth it. if i am worth it..."

"event","you never begin to think of how much you impact other people. how your smile encourages someone, or how your words can destroy the feelings of others. so easily and subtly we impact others and help shape their feelings and attitudes. everyone that you meet impacts you in some way, whether in that very moment or whether it is their memory that teaches you. remember this and understand how much you are capable of influencing others, but also how easily you are influenced yourselves.

for everyone who i have ever gotten to meet, this is for you. 

thank you, i am who i am because of you...."

"event","i wish i could teach you how to love. love is fleeting, love is incredible, love is beyond words, love is above words, love is depressing, love is inspirational, love is everything and anything you could ever need. for those who have had the oportunity to really love or be loved ----> congrats to you. for those of you still waiting ----> don't give up hope, trust me it is worth the wait, in fact it makes the end result that much better.

loving someone is a scary feeling, especially if you get to the point where you can bear your innermost secrets. it becomes where you are entirely defenseless, you hold nothing back and you expect the only response will be horror, but if you are lucky this is not the case, instead you recieve a faint smile and then the same honesty is poured back upon you. that is love, it is when two people are so close and comfortable that you show it each other everything and it does nothing except strengthen the bond you two have already created. one odd mixture of strength, hope, tears, sweat, and blood. these are the ingredients to this thing we call love."

Life travels faster than we ever thought it could, but yet at the moment it couldn't move any slower. For this very reason we often put off desires and wants because we can simply do them later. However, in that moment your decision is unique and that opportunity will never happen again. Never live in regrets, only do what you know to be right and fair. Take a risk if necessary, in those moments when we are most vulnerable we often find new strengths within us...."

"event","I have this problem. See, I really want to update. I want to tell you everything about what I'm thinking, feeling. But whenever I go to try, I sit at the blinking cursor, trying to figure out where I'm supposed to start.
This weekend I went home for the Fourth of July. I actually got quite a bit done, surprisingly. I used to never be productive in that house. But somehow I got my ass in gear and got five or so resumes ready to send out: two to Nevada, one to California, one to New York, one to St. Paul. Yup, exactly five envelopes. Does my confusion on where I want to end up show?
I also ran into my ex boyfriend. Almost literally. He almost plowed me over. Seeing him made my heart stop. I hadn't seen him since high school. He looked the same. Exactly the same. He's always made me nervous. ""Never comfortable"" as Toby put it. I guess I never really was comfortable with him. I don't know if I mean that in a bad way or not. He was just one of those people that I wanted to impress ... wanted to be the best version of myself around. Yet it seemed like everything that came out of my mouth around him was stupid. Anyway, back to the matter at hand, I didn't say anything to him. He didn't see me. I walked faster to get away from the situation. For a while the next few days I'd kicked myself for not saying anything to him. I sat up at night wondering what he was doing, where he is living, is he a good father? But I don't think I need those answers. That was a long time ago, and something I'm better off leaving in the past. ""Poor ghost. Old love.""
I don't have much time left here in Decatur. It's kind of bittersweet, really. I know I'm always talking about leaving this place, and rightfully so, but a few things will be missed. But definitely, DEFINITELY, not the nymph that lives above me.
Other than those things, I bought cute new shoes, two new CDs, and all is looking bright."

"event","My Mood:
You are constantly hoping that your good fellowship and attitude and your 'love for your fellow man (or women)' will give you peace of mind. You need people - people around you to care for you and to show you that they care. It is this hope that keeps you going, the hope that makes you the type of person that indeed you are. Your own need for approval seemingly makes you always ready to help others and in exchange you seek love, warmth and understanding. You will always listen to others and you are open to new ideas which hopefully will prove fruitful and interesting.

You are working extremely hard trying to improve your image. You need for those people in positions that matter to recognize your potential and to acknowledge you.

Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.

You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.

You feel that you need to move on. You feel that you are not appreciated or valued for what you are and that the time is 'now'. Failure to do so will not afford you the conditions to prove your worth."

This phase of my life needs to end quick. I'm over it already.
I need new. I need passion for something, anything. It's been so long since I've felt truly passionate about something. I mean something of significance. Of course I've felt passionately about a band or an album or a song. But I'm thinking bigger picture here.
If life is truly what you make of it, I haven't made much life yet.
It's weird how one day you think your world is going to end and the next morning you wake up to realize how foolish you were. It never meant much anyway. Especially in hindsight. Funny how a break in routine can be so frustrating. Yet this is really the most liberated I've felt in quite a while.

Gosh. I'm in such a good mood. This weekend set the tone. I hope it stays this way a long, long time. I don't want to fall back in that rut I was in.
This weekend was super amazing. I went to a journalism conference in St. Louis. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I had. I hung out with people I usually don't hang out with and didn't have to worry about any of the crap I usually have to put up with. And though I didn't think it could happen again, it actually got me excited about journalism again.
I have a lot of great things in my life right now. This is the first time in a long time I've actually felt optimistic. Wow. Mark this day on your calendar, folks. April 15, 2003: Erin actually writes an upbeat journal entry. Not even a twinge of cynicism!

I don't really know how to go about negating that notion, because looking back at what I've written it is somewhat obvious that I'm a cynical person more than not. Any why shouldn't I be? Cynical is safe, or at least that's what I've burned into my brain to make me feel less vulnerable to all the bad shit that happens in the world everyday.
On a lighter note, I'm actually going to be doing something I enjoy for the next few months, namely working for <a href=""http://www.bifirecords.com"">Bi-Fi Records</a>, a local record label co-owned by previously mentioned Joe.

It's amazing how four hours of classes can rid me of any said energy I had when I woke up (not when I got out of bed ... I mean when I really consciously woke up about an hour or so after that). I walk in the door, and the couch magnetically pulls me in (I swear I can't fight it), and I proceed to sit there for the rest of the night. It's really quite sad, actually. The only thing I got up for (sans bathroom breaks) was when we went and bought a movie and then brought it home to sit on the couch and watch when I should be reading for my classes. I, unsuprisingly, have no desire to do any school work (senioritis hit before last semester was halfway through).
So I did, in fact, meet said boys who moved into our apartment building. As I suspected, I wasted a perfectly good half hour of my life. I wish I'd never met them just so the wonder and curiosity was still occupying my brain. Instead, I heard them talk about smoking weed. One couldn't even remember if he had taken a multicultural literature course a year ago. Give me a break.

You know it's time to change something when you look at your relationships and realize you have a lot of acquaintances and very few close friends.
I went to a wedding yesterday. Weddings are fun, but damn are they depressing. I've pretty much realized I'm no good to anyone in relationships, which leaves me perpetually single, at least for now. But I can't help but feel extremely alone while watching a friend from high school and her husband look at each other like there's noone else in the world that exists at that particular moment.
To top off this feeling, I have four weddings on my calendar for the upcoming summer months. Two of which I'm a member of the wedding party. Not to sound selfish; I mean, their happiness is important to me too. But really, there's very few events (besides the horrible three-holiday-in-a-row love fest that occurs around this time of year) outside of a wedding that make your personal life seem more pathetic and permanent by the minute."

My life is so dependent on you, on your voice, on your daily reassurance.
A few days ago things weren't going so hot between us. Maybe we're ""in a slump"" you said. Maybe we were. But now that this has happened, and your life is hectic, so is mine.
It's hectic because your grandma is sick and you're stressed out. It's hectic because it aches inside me to see you so upset. It's hectic for a lot of reasons. But most of all, it's hectic because it means I get to hear less of you.
Somehow the events of my life aren't real, or aren't significant until I've shared them with you--no matter how insignificant the event really is. Quitting my job, buying a new CD, it doesn't matter.
You've begun to define me. That scares me, but it also excites me at the same time. It scares me because what am I supposed to do in times like this when I have to sit and watch my phone, praying it will ring any second. It scares me because I'm so completely dependent on someone I can't actually be with for nine months. It scares me because I feel so completely vulnerable to something that I can't for the life of me control, no matter how hard I try to grasp it. It excites me for all the same reasons.
What is going on with me? I've never let myself be so open, so vulnerable. ""I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so alone."""

At Sam Goody yesterday, Vagrant sent Amber and I some promos of the new Hot Rod Circuit album as well as Audio Learning Center's debut.
Hot Rod Circuit sounds way too produced. Everything is so flowing and melodious; a definite departure from their rough, edgy sound from before. I like the old Circuit stuff better, I fear.
A lot of Vagrant bands have been spending a lot more money to sound a lot more mainstream these days. I'm not sure if I have an opinion on that yet or not. I'll keep you posted."

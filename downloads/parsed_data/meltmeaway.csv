college has been so interesting.

i love my roomies.
we're such a potluck, i cant help but feel greatful.

boys can be so wonderful.
but then just be such a pain.
solitude isnt that bad.

Ive been like MIA all summer and i suppose its alright.
Most of the important people see me, but then again alot of my favorites I dont see enough.

So i got my roommate info for Towson tonight. Thats pretty exciting aye? Except with this internet and such calling on the phone seems like its just way too much pressure.

Life is good. The boyfriend is wonderful. I was pretty much living at his house while his parents were away. Its weird being able to spend that much time with someone and not get tired of them, especially a sig. other.

For those who care out there in the LJ/Theater world, Ive picked up sewing again, (thanks project runway! lol JK). Anyways, its nice, atleast it'll give me an excuse to spend some time with Gussie if i get in a bind or whatever."

"event","this is weird. 
im at kates,
its about the usual crash time of a little bit after 3.
 everyone disperses with their lovers, and i am alone.
this bed is huge, so many people could fill it.
nevertheless, i am alone.

self exploration while being solitary isnt as impowering as i foresaw it to be.

a lot of wonerful things have been going on in the last month.
i just wish ihad someone to stand by me during them.
the battery on this computer is about to run out, so maybe i should make this quick.
the 5 beers i drank tonight have done nothing for me, that is not like me.
this past month has been sobering.

1000 memories hit me at once.
sadness doesnt make me cry.
i think its being overwhelmed by everythings that different, even though the scene hasnt changed.
to quote evita, the actress hasnt learned her lines.
everything looks the same, except suprisingly a little cleaner.
the weathers about the same, atleast i were the same clothes.
chebez is gone, and that sucks.
he/she/it would atleast keep me company.
i didnt think id feel this empty.

we all sit together and love one another.
but getting up to take a piss, only one person gets kissed on the mouth.
i think of when that was aaron and i.
i think about the anticipation of finally having him alone.
then i remember all the nights i was so sleepy i oculd hardly stay awake to kiss him goodnight.
now, with almost 24 hours of my eyes open, id stay awake for another day to just share a cigarette one more time."

its weird, we talk like he'll be here in a few months, 
like nothing is ever going to change.
like california does suck ass and should fall off the fucking country.
im so greedy and selfish about this but im tired of not being greedy and selfish.
i dont care about being justified.
things were just getting good.
we've been through so much.

my grades, oh how they slip. straight A's one semester, to the medicocrity of B's all across the board, and thats if im lucky.
i dont know how i became such a fuck up so fast, its amazing how that happens isnt it?

plainly put, last weekend was really wonderful i must say.
saturday and sunday were spent with old and new friends. and of course aimless driving and eventual breakfest with the boy never fails to make me happy.

i wish i didnt have to go to the pizza shop, id much rather dance to loud music this evening.

i just wanted to let the world know...

im in the library currently and avoiding homework.
hannah had to be kind enough to inform me that these bcpl computers dont have restrictions, that can be dangerous i suppose?

its a share how bad we've fucked up the world.
the weather is all wacked out.
today i didnt walk to the doctors office mainly because i was just too lazy.
now thinking back, was it worth it?
how long is this air going to be gone?
will my great grand kids be able to go out in the sun without 50some SPF and burn in the ozoneless sunshine?
will the glaciers melt and suddenly the roads will turn to rivers?

anyways, im looking forward to cruise right into spring break and then the summer.
then of course towson. its nice to have the secruity of just knowing what the hell im going to be doing with myself for atleast the next year. after i sign myself away on may 1st, ill atleast have school worked out, even if i can hardly count on anything else.

speaking of school, i look forward to body worlds next week. any other eaders going? its so conveinent school is going because i was going to go anyways. ever since the summer i've been looking forward to its arrival. nevertheless, i wish kate and co were going to be there to accompany me. 

every wednesday is now my mommas and i's time. this is definately nice. we're actually begining to talk about things. school, friends, BOYS! (something we hardly talked about except superficially) I actually enjoy the time we spend together these days. 

is it rediculous to be nervous about going to the hint show because i got into a nasty car accident last time i went to one of their shows? ahh im superstitious, ill admit!

so senior year is cruising right along and im getting more into high school then ever so far this year.
my classes hard really hard but i dont mind too much i suppose.
in case anyone has heard my cough, i dont have the whooping cough thank you very much, it just gets scrratchy and itchy and stuff.

tomorrow is someone's birthdya and i wont be able to see him.
in my opinion this really fucking sucks.
nevertheless, i will survive, you kinda have to right?

this evening was nice with my mom.
tonight for possibly the first time ever, we were just too beat to do any shopping and melted down into the booths of TGI FRIDAYS in Towson. This was exceptionally nice i must say. Especailly after watching a dr,phil of fucked up mothers and daughters, i was like whoa, we need to make sure we're not like that when we grow up.

speaking of talk shows, did anyone catch the oprah today. it was about that show intervention. they showed a girl who had literally lost a wonderful and bright future as a white house intern and a full scholarshiip to somewhere because she got addicted to crack while at her internship. she did all the ""normal"" rec drugs of high school, yet then became a crack addict after all the achievements she had made while [artying it up on the sly. this was crazy, but nevertheless, that wasnt what erked me.

there was another iglr on there who was a cutter. for some reason, she just really got on my nerves. i was resentful towards her, and dint understand wtf her deal was at points. i hate to seem anti-sympathetic livejournal land! they were showing video diary of her mutilating herself and i felt awful for her at some points, i must admit. but the way she acted towards other people sometimes rell pissed me off. maybe it is because i see how i can treat people in her or something like that. nevertheless, watching it made me want to throw up.

on a lighter note, happy PI day everyone. i have discovered in my wise old senior years, that the hottestof the hotties are always the ""nerds"" and misfits. for example, all those sexy actors, they were at one time theater kids just like the rest of us. and science kids are just looking increasingly hott.

too many hormones floating around in this LJ entry.
enjoy!

i wonder if i could've just stayed with her during this christmas bullshit.
i doubt ill wrapp tackyass paper around the half-thought gifts for my mom.

i wonder why, you cant spend time with someone you love.
how come 5 months is sucha meaningless thing to people?
i wonder if my mom really understands.
i wonder if she remembers what it feels like.
oh wait, she cant.
she backed out of her 20 year marriage to grow old with a 65 year old nazi.

this is what resentment tastes like.
i cant wait to not live here next year.
i definately will not be here for christmas, ill tell her the 20 exits down 83 is just ohsotoomuch of a drive for me make.

incase anyones been wondering where i've been hiding, i pretty much have been inhabiting kates apartment.
this summer i've grown alot, and i think maybe too much for my own good. i feel like ill be going into college now, not the structures of high school. signing up for enrichment, not being able to indulge in nicotine when i see fitting, not even having sodas in class, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. nevertheless, i think the idea of being a seniorgirl seems very fun. i promise to be nice though. xxxxxxx

the state fair starts for me tomorrow. yesyesyes, i still have been playing with the cows. it's been going just fine except i go from the barn where im stinky to the pizza shop where im greasy, so my complexion is just ohsopleasent.

thanks to someone who i do not know, i am finally informed of the summer reading requirements. is anyoneelse pissed off at the assigning of books, especially if they probably wont have anything to do with the curriculum? but, i have no clue what mr.mcgraw has in store for jane eyre or heart of darkness this upcoming year. 

it getting chilly makes me sad. i wish i drove. i'd spend my nights in the city and come to school all tired everymorning. i definately would try that (which is the sad, sad, sad truth). nevertheless, i look forward to bundling up and walking to his apartment in wool coats and mittens. just the idea of all the things ive had this summer leaving is disappointing. i've pretty much came of age i feel like. now i need to snap back into senior-in-high-school-dont-forget-to-sign-up-for-enrichment.

this weekend was definately nice.
i saw alot of people i wanted to, but not exactly everyone.
i had work tonight, and missed the company meeting this morning!!!
its all good though, i just got a ""talkin' too"".
pay checks are tuesday, im excited to get mine.
i need to find my bank card! i think im just going to have to get another.
the frusterating thing is that i think it's in my house somewhere.
no one can get in without the PIN anyways.

i was really looking forward to the Towson Spring Festival this year.
and now i have to work 11-5 on Sunday :(.
that just suck balls.
i dont work until 5 on saturday though.
so maybe some Fairy Fest plans can be salvaged.
im glad i only work on night this week.
i've been feeling a little worn thin lately.

my mommas off work most of this week.
im going to be pleased to have her home when i get home from school.
the only time i've experienced that really was when she had her accident, but that wasn't exactly pleasent or anything.
i hope the weathers nice this week.

i think im like established or something.
they want me working the saturday night rush, and they are joking and such. :)

i did the day of silence today.
the real thing,
not mouthing words or writing notes. 
just being a body that cant really put their input into the world around them.
unfortunately, i feel asleep in 6th period around 2 and woke up and was like whoa,
i fell asleep.
then, i broke it.
nevertheless, im proud of myself.
it gave me a feeling of such depression and suppression.
people said stuff i didnt agree with or i couldnt tell my friends i loved them.
and you guys know how i am! I AM A TALKER.
even though im working on that in my everyday life too.

so, the boy i worked with tonight was a bit cute :p
(shhhh!!!!!!!!!!)

i came home from annes house today kinda early, when i could've spent more time hanging out.
my goal was to come and spend time with my brother and such.
this didnt really seem to happen, i just came home to more cleaning.
and reminders that college is going to be such a burden on my family.
please, dont stress me out yet, i have over a year, and next year scholarships will be more available.
besides, i didnt go and buy beach houses and new cars.
so shut up :).

anyways, i had fun last night.
got pushed into the beginings of the smoke hole of doom.
then got the munchies really bad.
we're talking aweful.
then this morning hung out with anne and anna.
then blair and mark came over, i left shortly thereafter.
i wish i stayed now, (for just a little bit longer....)

last night is a blur and this morning came too early.
riding to bel air to pick up jeremy at i guess it was after midnight.
too many lines on the high way, blacking out.
stpehen came to MICA with me last night too.
the brother won the drinking race, and i boofed all night in my defeat.
everyone was passing out when we got back.
the car ride after picking him up was so interesting.
i reaked of vomit but couldnt help to sing with him.

how come looking at him this morning, while everyone else and he are asleep it was so different?
did i feel like 15 again? do i even know him?
him throwing me bones isnt what i want at all.
everyone roots us on but hes not even in the game.

it was awesome to spend time at MICA though.
the people there were most definately fun to be around.
i discovered that natty bo goes great on ice cream haha.

i mean, we're off school cos the roads are deemed undrivable right?
so why is everyone out driving around?
isn't it just crazy?

maybe tomorrow night kate will introduce me to some cute men.
thats what i need.
some cute slut drunken art boy off cheap beer lovin.
i just dont want to wake up with someone i dont know...and uhhh herpes. haha

theater fest is this weekend. im curious as to how it will be. usually weekends get so wild i hope i dont get cabin fever on a school trip :p. it will surely be fun, in one way or another. 

gunnar is going to buy me a car i think. probably something modest, which is what i want. having an uber-nice first car can probably be a mistake for me. i'll surely ding it up, and get burn holes in the seats. i know my parents know this too. i want a station wagon, we've always had them since i was a kid. its just a comfort thing i guess. besides, i want something everyone can pile in, and i can sleep in if need be. and the feeling of driving around in a little can, can be a dangerous proposition.

a night with old friends and drunken memories was just what the doctor ordered.
we were up until about 5:30 and woke up at 9.
the traffic coming home was hellish and it took 2 hours to get jeremy and me home (with a quick stop at panera). the three of us were quite a sight. but, it definately was fun. we even got our hands on some wine! so everyone had their poison of choice.

today was a combination of dreaming and dizzy sleep.
i winded up only going to work for 2 hours, which was nice.
when im awake im contemplative and nausiated.

i wonder if it's still snowing outside. 
driving home from work, i wanted to ask to pull over to dance in it.
can we get more emo? haha

im really getting excited for theater fest.

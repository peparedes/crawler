"event","a lot of shit has happened in the past few weeks.  I visited the grandparents in Florida where i swam in the ocean, pools, golfed, ate good food, drank a 12 pack o heinies with ma pops, got some wicked cool jewelry from my grandmother and shopped a bit... in addition i actually got a tan woooot.. well i already had the starts.. but yeh.. plussss i met a few boys haha... 2 under the age of 4.. and one.. prolly over the age of 21 atleast... he was the first really kyoot black guy to take notice of me I was flattered :-)..
  I have made a transformation this summer to feminine female instead of the complete stubborn tomboy i have always been... i can still be a tomboy and look decent right? anywayz...  

in other news...
I ended up going to a party which was a complete blast from the past... Darlene Fuckin Kehn, Will Andrews, Nick Frazey, Billy Schoonmaker, Joe Zaffutz, Bridget O'connor and Minehan, and yeh.. so much crazy shiot!!! I drank soo much beer.. completed a smoke stack (massive hit off of a beaudious piece and then chuggin a cup o beer), with only a mouthfull of puke after.. then of course, since the hosts live on a lake we hadda go swimmin'... my smart self decided to take out a canoe and explore a bit... upon my attempt to retrieve a ball that had been lost to the lake.. I capsized the canoe... i grabbed my purse and righted the boat asbest i could... treading water.. trying to keep everything in some semblance of order... i dragged the almost completely submerged vessle back to shore... someone was standing on the dock inquiring on my status... and helped a lil... whilst i spread all of my drenched belongings on a towel by the fire.. i take inventory and record my losses... my cell phone, digital camera, and Jay-Z the black album.. fuck fuck fuck was all that was going through my head.. how do i fuck up soo bad.. in a last frenzied attempt to gather my head i go running out, dive into the lake and swim back to the place where i approximated the wreck occured... i dove down a bit.. but the lake was entirely too deep for me to drunkenly recover and phone.. or digital camera... fuck.. al of my pictures from florida.. gone.. all of my 150 or so numbers... gone... the cd that had been keeping me relaxed and sane all summer... gone... so... the real damage....
1 Canon PowerShort A60..... $200
1 Samsung cellular phone... $170
1 Jay-Z The Black Album.... $13.99

The pictures and connections lost.. priceless...

hmm what else...
lotsa chillin out, a eye doctor and gyno appt.. new glasses and some anti-biotics for an e.coli infection i have in my urinary track.. and a clean bill of health otherwise for my Vag... good job kid.. oh yeh and i got my period for the first time since April, isn't that cool?

Most late breaking news.. Jana is again a single, free woman.
I broke up with Andrew yesterday... I hurt him pretty bad... he never wants to talk or see me again.. I guess i deserve it... i mean, how could i break his heart twice in two years and not expect him to be horribly upset... anywayz.. time to have my last meal with my father and brother and mother.. peace out.. and have a good year wherever you may be heading."

"event","so saturday night i shroomed for the first time... in one word... amazing... hah... matt and amanda had a horror film started (shaun of the dead) ... yeh i was thinking not the best thing for me to watch while trippin, but ehhh... it went fine.. i was on a roller coaster of emotions, i would scream with excitement and prolly some starledness and fear mixed in, then laugh at myself for being ridiculous and screaming at the movie.. or just laugh uncontrolably at some of the crazier shit that occured.. then i would have to spend about 5 minutes talking to myself in my head to calm down... THENNNN john and i went on an adventure back to his place, some semi scary happenings occured, but nothing major and we made it home safely.  We proceeded to trip for hours and played tony hawk and the dog and yeh just hung out talking and such. ANYWAYZ... i look forward to doing a full 1/8th in the future... 

hah.. i think the majority of my friends have decided i am crazy... i dunno if it is just in jest or if they are serious.. but i have begun to hear it a lil often and to tell you the truth it scares me a lil bit.. because i do feel crazed and not in control of myself at times.. but oh well.. hah.. John also asked, with a very deep inquisitive look on his face (yes although he is from illinois and sounds like he is stupid, he is quite sharp actually)""you have a lot of interesting conversations with yourself don't you?"" hehe.. and yes.. yes i do.. i have found i talk out loud to myself a lot more and have to censor a lot of my thoughts... just because the people around me wouldn't understand and it would take too much effort on my part to explain where the thought came from and itz relevance to the present conversation... ANYWAYZ... back to work i go... PEACE....
and yes steve, a good chunk of my friends here say Peace so neeeh"

"event","as most everyone that reads this knows Andrew came to visit.  After a brief period of anxiety and upsetness from him not waking up on time and me having to call him an hour later to get him out of bed I spent a wonderful Saturday just hangin out, being lazy and catchin up on all the snuggling and huggs that we had been deprived of.  We watched 45 minutes of home movies of me as a lil kid (14 months) definitely entertaining... and had a nice lil bar-b-q with the rents and just... enjoyed each other's company.  We slept in the tent together which was wonderful, no skinny dorm room beds or room mates around or parents or nuthin, just us and the night (maybe a bear or 2 right tootz?).  

We woak up early and had a packed sunday.. lots-o-stuff was accomplished... we hung out with justy and mandy briefly, then went mini golfing.. hell yes i had par the back 9 holes :-) but andrew did end up winning cause i had a crappy run of 3 5 stroke holes in a row :-/ thennnnnnn i filled up on gas for $2.24 a gallon.. yeh thatz right amazing huh? moved onto Jenn's graduation party since tootzie was a bit stressed and obviously needed some company... we only stayed for a brief period since any big to-do at the Teets residence tends to get a lil overwhelming.. although excellently executed and good food all around.  then... napped.. a wonderful nap with some normal napping procrastination of the sexual nature o:-) and yeh.... onto dinner with the rents at ghandi's.. delicious as usual... and to Matt's afterwards to hang out with him, mandy, jamie, tooootzie, lulu and shotty.  I really love those guys... matt is especially cool when he isn't too wasted... I can't wait to help him out at the end of this week, I hope i can be helpful enough... and not in the way.. i think it should be good... ANYWAYz after that we headed to Ron the Freindly's manager's place for a PAR-TAY fucking.. it was so much fun.. good good people thatz for sure... met some awesome dudez and ladiez... Ben, Ron, Aldo, Jill, fuckin Ann Marie cool asss chick!! and yeh played a lot o foooooz ball, i definitely dominated the majority of the time (especially when games were 1 on 1) :-) hehe i lovez it... and a beer pong game.. but thatz not really ma game so yeh... went on 2 adventures one with jill, which ended up with a ""goose egg"" or in otherwords nothin.. and then a lil walk with ann marie was excellent.. i am callin that chick and we will have so much fun.  Kristine and lulu were gettin their macks on... haha Tootzie was spittin shit the whole time haha and gettin lotza boys' attentions (thatz right of course i was keepin an eye on you tootz) she was quite thoroughly plastered by the time andrew and i left..

ANYWAYZ yeh... had a bit of an emotional drive home but ended with some AMAZING SEX!.... OMG... thatz all i can say here... we were up until 4:15 in the mornin.. fuckin' til the sun came up... quite literally... We hadda wake up at 9:20... that was a lil rough.. but it was steamin' in the tent so we were well motivated... grabbed 2 handlez o cheeep vodka for my bro and had some breakfast and lotsa good kisses and huggs... and byebye andrew... 

Yeh.. so there is my rant and summary of the weekend.. If i missed anything that was fun... well.. this is long enough so there.. haha.. fuckin... I am so happy right now.. mark this one down in the books as one of the most excellent weekends of summer 05... 
now.... who knows.. FUCK! I have an appointment to get my teeth checked out... what time is that... gottta run... 

Peace!"

Well they fucking did it and are the first baseball team to do it.. ever... Congratz to the Red Sox.  It was cool to walk down Beacon street and hear a happy roaring crowd of Bostonians and Sox fans over by Fenway... then as i got closer to Kenmore Square it seemed as if i was at a night club thee were so many strobe lights... and by strobe lights i mean cop cars and riot squad trucks... it was quite an amazing site to see... Again, i express how cool it was to see all of these Red Sox fans so happy... but i ask.. if you are so fucking happy.. why the fuck would you commit so many acts of vandalism and violence?  I don't understand people in general... Oh.. and another thing... the riot squads and police force stood on and watched as most of this happened... If a small group of 100 or less peace protestors were to crowd the streets in such a manner or even resist directions from an officer they would be arrested and possibly dealt with in a more physical manner.. what the fuck?...Anywayz... those are some of my thoughts...

"event","This is more for myself than for everyone.. but i figured.. i would prolly wanna tell a lot of people most of this wonderousness anyways.. so..I need to make a list of everything that happened over the span of latenight thursday, august 19th to the early morning of sunday, august 22nd.  

Owen sits down next to us, starts talking to amanda, i see him and am just like... wow... he has my hair.. how crazy.. i hope mandy makes friends with him (she is always good at making cool guys become a part of our hang out group)

Then, We met....
~play some sort of cats cradle type game with one of my hair bands... twisting and preserving the shape of it and yeh...
~play a bit of hacky sac...

he leaves to get beer somwhere....

~i am playing with a cat a block or so away from the bar
~he comes over and we start playing with the cat together and talking...
~we decide to start attempting to walk across a very thin fence on the side of the sidewalk
~eventually we get good enough that we can meet in the middle multiple times... and it is just an invigorating experience...
~then we went to hang out in my car with everyone else
~we smoke a bit

~owen and i move outside of the car and talk about working with kids, family, experiences..... and just... lots of stuff
~we decided to go swimming in the mohawk river, well owen and i... on the way we are eaten alive by bugs

~we go to dunkin donuts.. i'm not sure why.. just hung out there, played hacky sac, talk etc
~go across the street and play in a big open field:tag, wrestle, tumbling and martial artsy stuff, then everyone ended up sitting around and talking and everyone was paired off, in lil massage pairs.. manderz and jr, tootz and jay and me and owen.. lotsa talking..
~went to owen's old apartment that is unlocked.. no furniture or anything...
~sat around talking and smoking a bit...
~manderz, tootzie, jr and jay left; owen and i hung out together for the rest of the night

~went out for a walk and left flowers on someone's mailbox, balanced on fencing and such...
~returned to apartment: colored, played cards, laughed, had a pretty pg-13 night... well... maybe r... neh pretty pg13... and stayed up all night...

~at about 7:30am i think... we went out and started walking through an old graveyard and around the town.. it was a stockade,.. and it is so historic and the gorgeous buildings were built in the 1700 or 1800s and we picked flowers to decorate each other with and played with a dog (paulie), and talked to townies, and got coffee and walked more and swang on swings... 
~and yeh, then we left and headed to my house, listened to music talked etc.. i called my mom on the way home.. and told her that i had stayed with owen.. and she was mad because she thought i lied to her since i had said before i was sleeping at amanda's even though i was planning on it at the time... so she was mad.. plus i was bringing a ""random stranger from scotia no less"" into her home... i was a lil worried...but i thought mom would be ok...

~we walk into my house and my mom is obviously pissed...
~she looks at owen... and then starts talking to him... and realizes... things just happened... and i wasn't being bad... just twitterpated (not her words)after 5 or 10 minutes of talking to him she is like.. can you please go outside and come back in so we can get off on the right foot? so we do... and yes gloriousness

~we hang out in my room and house; look at pictures, random stuff, talk, listen to music,nap, play nintendo, look at FEW movies... he thinks all of them are hilarious, go for a walk, make omelets and bacon for my dinner for my brother, dad and ourselves...

~head over to aaron apple's were Dan STangl's band is playing, plus jason luby's and another band.. lots of fun was had, we played hackysac, and danced, he ,met alot of cool averill parkians... really liked kopache and dan guitonie (sp?)and dustin.. funny that those are some of my favorites aswell... 
~go over to justy's and hang out with marilu before she goes back, tootzie, manderz, emily, greggy, justy of course, kopache and sam R then jr and.... his friend.. i can't remember his name... will? anywayz played pool, smoked pot, ate yummy food... 
~he thinks all of my friends are great

~returned to my house for the night, started to watch good will hunting.. we fell asleep on the couch prolly around 3:30 or 4... i woak up at 8:30 or 9... let him sleep a bit, turned on the tv and watched ghostbusters, he eventually woak up and yeh we just chilled, then we played scrabble and made delicious pesto and goodness sandywhiches... (not necessarily in that ordeR) tried to download a lot of music... listened to a lot of music, watched finding forrester, he loved it like i knew he would, danced together to stevie wonder ""you are the sunshine of my life"" and ""somewhere over the rainbow"", better than ezra ""Extra ordinary"" just ta name a few... 

~head over to amanda's before we go to the vandyke to see Patty play
~annie, johnnie, betsy and steve are playing when we walk in so owen and i dance briefly, then head up to mander'z room hang out with justy and mandy.., owen gets out her guitar and plays, then i go get the drum, and we smoke some  and play some more together.. 

~eventually we left to go to the vandyke... in which owen took mandy'z usual place of navigating
~he proceeds to make us take a round about route cause i got him occupied with opening candy for me and didn't realize we needed to take the exit i was going to take (thought we were on a diff. highway) 

~so we finally get to the vandyke, drink about 1/3 of our forties then head in, patty is in the middle of playing,she was really good, i covered a paper bag in artwork after making a spoon man... owen and i talked and yeh.. after patty's we were hanging out outside again...

~we decided to go to Dawn's appartment, owen and i left gummy worms on the mailbox we had left the flower on the night before, and at dawn's we hang out a bit drink our forty's, smoke somme more, listen to black eyed peas, i color more, and draw more crazyness on a plate, then we headed out to another bar to meet a few of owen's friends.. 

~we get there, i go in with owen to the bar, meet his friends, say hello, but the bartender says without bID that says i'm 21 i need to stay outside so i go outside smoke with mandy and justy quickly, owen comes out shortly and says his friends are coming, they come out.. i was a lil less social than usual cause i wasn't interested n being engulfed by cigarrette smoke, but i really wanted to meet rocky and chuck.. we started to play hacky sac and then cops yelled at us and said we couldn't hang out there.. we continued to loiter a lil longer, and then... we parted ways, owen went with his friends and i went with mine...

what can i say to sum all of this up?....
It was/is so amazingly incredibly, that it seems almost surreal... and now... i don't really wanna go back to school yet..."

Now, i believe we have a truly good system... we are dating but not exclusively... so now i guess we'll see how things go with andrew... it was so wonderful to talk to him and hear him laugh and know he is smiling as he talked to me.... anywayz, even though all this wonderousness is going on i really have to buckle down and get my friggin major papers done, considering one is worth 30% and the other 25% i believe... yeh not to mention studying nd everything... ok, i am about done for this entry..."

I am really worried about him... for the last three years i have been there for him to talk to...to support him... but now i'm not.. and i guess he may be right... i did abandon him in a way... but, i don't understand why he didn't talk to me and try to change my mind right there and then when i told him i thought i needed some time for personal growth.... it is hard, because i still look around my room, or take a shower and think of him... after years of connecting him with anything i see or do it is hard to stop... i don't like being alone for that reason, when i get left to myself i think too much...i don't know if i'll ever stop loving him...

I don't want to write these silly papers, just sit me down with the professor or my TA and i will argue a bit with them, that is what i wannabe graded on.. i friggin sat down with a friend and helped him get out an awesome thesis,.. but no i can;t do it for myself.. ok i should prolly go to bed... it may take a while for me to get to sleep.... i am hoping this mood will go away because it is imparative that i am productive tomorrow.."

"event","Welp, seeing as i havn't written since i have been back there is obviously a lot that could be included in this.  Steve and I had a great time.  We had the greatest dinner ever, we stayed in, microwaved hot dogs and drank chocolate milk... it was wonderously romantic ::nodnod:: umm yeh it was great being with him..   we even hung out over on FEW one of the nights and ma FEW boiz and my Sweetie Steve were laughing together, such a great sight.  anywayz, so yeh i spent close to $300 on books, which isn't tooo bad looking back the the close to $500 last semester.  My math class is a joke.. we talked about real numbers and irrational numbers and integers and sets the first lesson, then second lesson we talked about polynomials and exponents.. sillyness.. the woman that i work with in the records office is in the class aswell.. except this stuff is hard for her considering she has been out of school for years.  My history class should be good, a lot of reading in a well written text book , and a few writing assignments but nothing horrible and the professor is a decent lecturer she doesn't drone on in a monotone or studder.  My writing class should be good aside from the immense amount of reading due every tuesday and thursday but ohh well.  Psych is psych.. i haven't heard him lecture yet so we will see how that goes, not too much reading there... only about 20-40 pages every tuesday and thursday....  so yeh.  I am actually doing well turning my study habits around.  I have read so much for my courses it is crazy... i think i am already infringing on the amount of reading i did all last semester... well not really. but after two weeks of this performance... seriously i may.  The first night i started all the reading i felt really overwhelmed and dah... plus i just wanted to know that i'd be sleeping with steve that night, like the past few nights.... but that would not be the case... ::sigh:: being dependant on somone's presence i guess you have to take the good with the bad... dooby doo i dunno not too much more to say.. except for the fact that -30 to -40 degrees is f-ing cold and ridiculous i want snow not cold... ok so yeh i'm done..."

"event","Now that i have finished harry potter the order of the pheonix i don't quite know what to do with myself.  I have watched entirely too many movies this vacation i feel like i should be doing somthing more.  I went with amanda and saw the wailers last night.. for those who don;t know who the wailers are they are the band that played with bob marley so it was all cool reggaeness and they found a singer that really did sound almost exactly like marley.  
i can't wait to see my stephen... 5 days... dahh still an eternity.. well i don;t have anything else to babble about.. so i guess i'm done for now.. maybe i'll find somthing else to read that i can get done in a few days..."

"event","Well, it is a happy new year after all... for a while i thought it was going to be a very lonely and soggy new year... When Steve told me that he didn't think we should continue as girlfriend and boyfriend a ton of bricks got dropped onto my chest and my stomach churned horribly... even though it was only a few days i don't ever want to have to deal with the thought of having to exist without knowing Steve is there to talk to, and hold me, and laugh with.. or at me.  When he agreed to giving me a last chance the bricks were removed... i was not instantly happy, because i understand that it will be some work for me to act accordingly in order to truly show my devotion to Steve and our relationship, but now the world seems brighter than ever.  I can't wait to be near him again and to be able to spend a whole 3 days with him... i wish we both had more time so we could be together more... i suppose that shall be somthing i have to anxiously wait for.  
OK.. harry potter is calling my name and seeing as it is only 8:30 i should really find somthing to do.."

"event","Welp, i got home last night.. not too bad of a ride, only 3 hours and 15 minutes even with some traffic in boston and since it was with Steve it was more enjoyable than anything else...  I ended up having to share a room with my brother since my mom doesn't want me sleeping with Steve cause of my brother ""being too young"" so yeh,... this morning he is getting ready for school, and i wake up with the wonderous idea that i should drive him into school and penetrate the old H.S.  Well it worked like a charm.. i walked in with my brother and Miss Megan took a double take and then was all happy and silly and immidiatly walked me to the office to get me signed in as a guest... ms.cioffi was like i'm not supposed to do this... but miss megan was just like ohhh she'll be out before classes start... and yeh :-) so i went and said hi to Mr. McP, Mr. VanVliet, Steig, Mr. Ladd, JoZ and yeh... I tried to find Mr. McKeeby and Gaynor... but alas they were MIA... ohhh and i dropped in on the first gym class, and Hershy and Man-dici let me play speedball i was so excited, Stangl and Apple and Dan Schwartz was there and it was just like last year... well minus a few crucial people, but hey, no one is perfect.  Um Um... ohh yeh, went back home snuggled with Steve for a lil bit, then made some grilled cheese, packed up my boi and went to the airport.  I stayed there until he was done with security and walking to his gate,... so about an hour or so and then went to crossgates to get my phone fixed considering i killed it the other day wrestling with one FEW boi or another and got a ""replacement phone"" aka the same exact phone that i already had for $50 since the damage was unfixable... then i did a lil shopping got my stevie somthin... then i've been hangin around online ever since... ohhh being home..."

"event","I love my job.  I get paid to sit around and do things such as talk to my friends online, read e-mail,do homework and catch up on the news.  The rare times that i do ""work"" it is usually pretty mindless and consists of filing pieces of paper into a disheveled cabinet with the various members of the School of Ed. , but when filing, for 5 out of every 7 papers the folder i need to file that paper in does not seem to be here.   One of the more interesting aspects of my job is how i am the one that answers the majority of phone calls; ""Hello, School of Education Records Office how can I help you?""  following this lil schpeel somone on the other end goes into some long elaborate explanation of a problem that they have and need assistance with.  After listening to all this i basically tell the person that does the real work, Lisa, a short summary of what i think to be the sitch and she in turn actually deals with the person.  I, in actuality, have no question answering abilities so when people walk into the office, i am required to look up, say, ""Hi, What can I help you with?"" then hope Lisa was listening and have her explain what the need to do, or if i am here by myself i stare blankly at them for a brief second, file through my memory and try to remember if Lisa has ever answered this question and then say, ""I am not quite sure but.......""  good times at SED Records...  I suppose it is a good thing because now i will have ample time to update this nice little journal even if it is only rambling about nothing that is at all important.  I guess i will actually attempt to study some American Politics."

"event","well, here is the first entry... wooo not a live journal virgin anymore.. Today was the last day of my field experience.  No more getting up at 6 every Wednesday morning hopping on a big yellow school bus and riding for 45 mins-an hour.  Aside from that no funness though i am really gonna miss my chillens.  They all made me adorable cards, and i played kick ball today... kicked a triple, which should been a home run if i wasn't in dress shoes on a slushy icey blacktopped surface and caught a ball kicked by one of the kids that enjoys giving me the hardest time:-).  Umm so yeh, i think that is sufficient for my first entry... we'll see how long i keep up writing here... onto working on a paper... joy of all joyz"

"event","I just found out how to do this. It is pretty interesting.For some reason I have been wanting to read about herbs. I really want it to be Spring. I like Spring because it is not to hot and not to cold. For Christmas I got one of the Sims games. It is the Makin Magic one. It is awesome! That is pretty much all I do. Well it has been a pretty good day."

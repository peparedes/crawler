"event","<div align=""right"">Okay, so it's 1:30 AM and I can't sleep; but at the same time, I'm too tired to work on anything. Consider this my attempt to justify being awake. <p>I do most of my mental writing at work, as most of the jobs I've had don't require a high level of mental stamina. So while I'm working, I'm usually far away in my head on random trains of thought; making lists of things to do, planning for the weekend, brainstorming and tweaking possible story ideas, etc. This is usually where my projects get approved or rejected. I play around with an idea, see what I can do with it, and decide whether or not it's worth pursuing. Lots of stuff ultimately gets thrown out, but there are a few projects that I'd like to pursue once Wayward is completed. Some of these I've mentioned here before, but have never really elaborated on, until now. <p>Whether or not the following projects are pursued is still up in the air, as are the titles and details and order in which these projects are started. Consider this pre-production. Everything is subject to change.<p>(Actually, I'm just writing all this out of fear that I'll forget about these ideas when I actually get a chance to pursue them. I have a memory like a goldfish with ADD.)</div><p><div align=""left""><b>Todbob</b></div><p><div align=""right"">Once Wayward #1 is finally completed, I really want to get back to working on Todbob on a weekly basis. As of right now, I have the rest of the Environmenteers/Mexican Wrestler story arch written, as well as the next arch. I can't say much, but it involves a war between the greatest minds, the entire planet caught up in the crossfire, and uneasy truce betwen good and evil, and I dunno, maybe a love story or something.</div><p><div align=""left""><b>Nowhere (working title)</b></div><p><div align=""right"">I don't like the title, but it was the first thing that popped in my head, so I'll stick with it for the time being. Nowhere is actually a story I started working out in my head about three or four years ago. In my young foolishness, I was actually entertaining the idea of making this a flash-based online animated series. Then I remembered that I don't have the patience, resources, or training for flash animation. <br>If it ever sees the light of day, Nowhere is the story of a young girl whose dreams are becoming self-aware, developing their own independent personalities, and are wanting to play a bigger role than just figments of an imagination. They are becoming real and the lines between reality and nightmare are becoming blurred. I just realized that I really suck at writing these synopsis things. <br>As much as I hate making the comparison, Nowhere would probably have a mild Alice in Wonderland vibe to it, but not in cheesy goth reinvisioning way that American McGee and Marilyn Manson have been throwing around recently; just some similar moods and themes. I'm going to try to avoid it as much as possible.</div><p><div align=""left""><b>Theatre of the Eye</b><p><div align=""right"">In all honesty, Theatre of the Eye is a title I came up with when I was eleven year old, and I've just been looking for an excuse to use it since. For those of you who don't know the history; the comic code was a (for lack of a better term) seal-of-approval that was established decades ago in an attempt to keep ""morally questionable"" content out of comics, thus ensuring that our children wouldn't grow up to be communist homosexuals, or something like that. All it really did was put EC (Entertaining Comics-the company responsible for Vault of Horror, Tales from the Crypt, Shock SuspenStories, etc.) out of commission. So for years, there were no major horror magazines on the market. Fortunately, with the recent rise of independent (and comic-code-free) publishers like Image, Dark Horse, IDW, and DC's Vertigo line, along with the efforts of writers like Steve Niles, horror comics are making a comeback. <br>But we still don't have any old-skool EC style books being made. There's a few collections being made, but there's still no ghastly host arriving every month to bring us another collection of truly terrifying tales to chill us to the bones. <br>This is basically what I would like to do with Theatre of the Eye. Present a series of short, stand alone ghost stories told by a lovable ghastly character. It's not as good as just bringing back Vault of Horror, but it's the next best thing.<br>I'll probably not do this one because it is ripping off the EC books. As much as I want to bring back that classic horror fun for a new generation to enjoy, I fear my intentions would be misinterpreted.</div><p><div align=""left""><b>More Wayward</b></div><p><div align=""right"">This is way down this line, but I think with Wayward, I've got a setup for alot of material. I've been toying with the idea of eventually going back and expanding more on the history of my little prison school. The Simon Institute for Wayward Boys has alot of skeletons in its closet, and I think it might be fun digging them up.</div><p><div align=""left""><b>Lucid</b></div><p><div align=""right"">Some of my old friends might remember this one. Lucid was a short novella I was working on way way back in the day. I was about halfway done with it, and I scrapped it. It's hard to explain, it just stopped coming out right. I've always regretted quitting it and would eventually like to go back and get it right. I don't know if it would still be in the same format, as it provided alot of interesting visuals that might work better as a graphic novel. If I do pursue this, it would take a whole lot of rethinking.</div><p><div align=""left""><b>Surgeon General's Warning</b></div><p><div align=""right"">Another one I'm not sure about. A webcomic fictionalizing my non-fictional time at the Despondency House. It would be a comedy, but on a higher intellectual level than Todbob. Of course, the idea of another webcomic is a bit overwhelming.</div><p><div align=""left""><b>The Thus-Far Untitled Potential Social and Professional Suicide Graphic Novel</b></div><p><div align=""right"">No, that's not the title. All I'm going to say about this project is that it's been swimming around in my brain for a few months now, and the idea of actually doing it scares the shit out out of me. It would take a preticular type of tragic event that seems to be happening so constantly recently, and looks at it from a different, less-than-acceptable perspective. If I did this book, it would without a doubt be the most challenging story I've ever taken on. If it was published and put out there for the world to see it would either (best case scenario) change the way we as a society look at this type of tragedy and possibly take steps for future prevention, or (worst case scenario) get me drug out to the street and shot. Literally. If I didn't write this story just right there would be alot of people out there who would seriously want to kill me. And honestly, I wouldn't blame them. <br>Needless to say, I don't know if, or when, I would ever pursue this project.<p>So, I think that about covers it. I'm pretty sure I've got some more ideas bouncing around, but it's late and...yeah...it's late."

"event","<div align=""right"">You are not going to enjoy this. Trust me. This isn't going to be good for anyone.</div><p><b>[""the noise"" or ""more wonderful disappointments from your friends at the simon corporation""]</b><p><i>Seriously, where the hell is Wayward?!</i><p><div align=""right"">Since you've asked so politely, fictional voice of the collective masses, I'll fill you in. <br>So I got my proof copy back from the printer awhile ago and I discovered two major things: One-there are several pages that needed redone because the transfer from digital to print made them look very blurry. This is my fault because I initially started drawing without any thought towards printing setup. And two-the first issue is pretty short. Your average comic book is at least 20 pages...mine is currently only 17. <br>So I've looked over the first issue of my book, did a bunch of editing and reworking, and I've added 5 more pages to the first issue, bringing it up to a much more acceptable 22. This isn't 5 pages of filler either, I've used the extra pages to expand on the story and I'm alot more confident in this draft. Now I just have to redraw the necessary pages.<br>Normally, I might not go through so much trouble, but recently there have been several revelations concerning the future of the Wayward series. I can't say much about it right now, but it involves a few big-name comic publishers that you all have most likely heard of. <br>So for the time being, don't hold your breath waiting for Wayward #1. I'm not going to put something with my name on it out there unless I'm 100% confident in it. When it does come out, it will be worth it. I'll keep you posted.</div><p><i>Are you going to be at Wizard World Chicago '07?</i><p><div align=""right"">I'll be there, but only as an attendant. If, and that's a big if, Wayward #1 is out by August, I still don't think it's enough to warrant a table. If I was to seriously consider doing it, I would only have 2 months to finish and print Wayward #1 and #2, the Todbob Promo book, displays, merch, and build a life-sized Simon (yeah, you heard me). Even if I quit my job and gave up sleep, 2 months isn't nearly enough time.<br>Next year however...</div><p><i>What about [insert other projects here]?</i><p><div align=""right"">Todbob, Nowhere, Surgeon Generals Warning, and all my other various projects/crap are on hiatus until I manage to finish Wayward #1. Believe me, I'm busting ass to get this done. My life right now is working on the book, work, and getting ready for school (with occasional breaks for sleep and food). <p>That's it for questions. If there's anything I've forgotten or if you have any other questions post them here or email me at simon1428@gmail.com and I'll get to them sometime next year.</div><p><b>[PETA would have a field day on my ass.]</b><p><div align=""right"">So a few weeks ago, I'm passed out on the couch, dreaming of flaming clowns or exploding toddlers or whatever degenerates like me dream of, when I'm awakened by a somewhat panicky Nicole. It seems that while I was sleeping, she accidentally smashed Marley's tail in the bathroom door. (Marley is our cat, to avoid any confusion.) He seemed fine but he was bleeding a bit. So we took him to an animal ER. It turns out that when Nicole shut the door on his tail, it caused him to ""deglove"" (i.e. the skin on the tip of the tail slides out of place and looses proper bloodflow) and the only way to correct it is to amputate the damaged area. <br>Now, because I can already hear Jesi, Beth, and all my other female readers gasping in sympathetic horror, let me state that this is a very common situation and it was only maybe a centimeter off the tip of his already unusually long tail. <br>He was in the hospital overnight and he's fine now, but for some reason he seems to be very indifferent about me, which is odd because it was Nicole who clipped his tail. He still loves the shit out of her, but ever since the tail incident, he kinda wants me dead. I just can't win.</div><p><b>[I have to leave. I've told you too much already.]</b><p><div align=""right"">That's all for now. Don't expect me see me online for awhile, as I'll be too busy slaving away at my stupid little horror mag."

I'm currently in the process of screwing with some chumps that are trying to weasel money out of me.

"event","<div align=""right"">Aside from the usual barrage of camwhores sending me friend requests, I've been getting alot of questions about The Simon Corporation's various projects. Since I'm too lazy to respond to every single message, IM, and e-mail, I figured I'd try to knock out as many of your questions in a single blow as I can. I'm pretty sure this isn't going to be fun.</div><br><div align=""left""><i>Where the hell is Wayward?</i></div><br><div align=""right"">It seems the gods themselves are conspiring to prevent the first issue of Wayward to be released. My laziness aside, Comixpress: the company that is printing Wayward started suffering technical difficulties right about the time I was ready to submit the book, which caused them to temporarily cancel all incoming submissions, including my own. The good news is that they are back up with a brand-spankin'-new press and are rolling out orders; so I've submitted the book. The bad news is that the downtime has caused them to get backlogged, which means it's going to take them longer than usual to get to my book. Once they get to it, they'll print one proof copy, send it to me for approval and, considering everything looks good, I'll greenlight it and they'll begin the mass printing.<br><br>As of right now, I'm still waiting for the proof copy to inspect and either give them the go on it or make any necessary corrections. I'll post more on this as it develops.</div><br><div align=""left""><i>When it comes out, how can I get a copy of Wayward?</div></i><br><div align=""right"">I'm ordering a good quantity of copies to distribute to Brainstorm and other local comic shops (independent publishing is fun!). I'm also sending out a couple free copies to some close friends and long-time supporters, you know who you are. <br><br>If you don't live in Chicagoland, you can still get the book through Comixpress' online store. It's going to be about $3.25. I'll post a link whenever it becomes available. </div><br><div align=""left""><i>Are you going to be at Wizard World Chicago '07?</div></i><br><div align=""right"">Nothing's official, but let me take this moment to take my stance on the subject: Everyone I've talked to about it insist that I get a table at WWC and actively promote my work. However, the idea of sticking myself and, more importantly, my work out there scares the everloving shit out of me. I'll probably do it anyway, but I'll have to assemble a posse for support. I'll probably try to split a spot with the 2-D crew if they're interested.</div><br><div align=""left""><i>Are you going to make any Wayward/Todbob posters?</div></i><br><div align=""center""><img src=""http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r219/simon1428/DSCF1066.jpg""></div><br><div align=""right"">Well, there's the Wayward poster, looking quite nice as part of my AMAZING WALL OF SHIT V4.0. I'm going to make it available through Cafepress once the book comes out (the poster, not the AMAZING WALL OF SHIT). Of course, I'll post a link to the store when it's available. <br><br>I'm still working on a Todbob poster. As with all the merch I've made through Cafepress, I like to check out the finished product personally before I make it publically available, because Cafepress is notorious for making some crappy stuff (namely shirts). I'll make a post whenever it or any other merch becomes available.</div><br><div align=""left""><i>Is there a Simon Corporation website?</div></i><br><div align=""right"">I'm working on it. I'm a busy Jamie. Once complete, it'll be an online portfolio of sorts for my work. It will have a section for Wayward, Todbob, and all the other crap I've got going on. Blah blah, I'll post when it's up blah blah.</div><br><div align=""left""><i>How's Wayward #2 coming along?</div></i><br><div align=""right"">I'm about halfway done with it. I was hoping to be further along, but things have been chaotic recently; working on getting #1 printed, redesiging the Todbob site, moving, changing shifts at work, and being a lazy bastard that plays X-Box 360 all day long are all things that have slowed things down. I do plan on having it (and hopefully, #3) ready by WWC '07.</div><br><div align=""left""><i>What about Project 19?</div></i><br><div align=""right"">Huh? Oh yeah, that thing. Don't hold your breath.<br><p><br>Hope that covers everything. As usual, if you have any questions that weren't answered here, you can always message me through MySpace or email me at simon1428@gmail.com.

In another strage turn of events, Chicago may be going up against Indy at the Superbowl if Indy beats the Patriots tonight. If that happens, there will be an unholy rift between me and my family.

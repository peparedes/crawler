Since Matt has not updated in forever I decided to copy my friend Niki and update it for him. I also changed the theme of his journal. I think he'll like it. Don't worry I am doing this with his permission. He's currently engrossed in Zelda: Twilight Princess. That's all folks."

I went up Friday night, and we went to wegmans and got some stuff.  And then we went back to her dorm and watched movies it was fun.  Saturday morning we had breakfest and played some games on the computer.  Then we went to fright fest.  Fright fest was fun.  Yay Darien Lake.  I finally got to ride the superman.  It was a fun ride.  The preadator was also open.  But it kinda hurt.  I didn't remember that part.  Stupid getting fat.  Oh well.  The haunted house was a mixture of funny and scary.  I did jump once or twice.  We also went on the Viper.  It rained a little while we were waiting to go on the superman.  So after we did that we went to the arcade.  With our tickets combined we got Casey a cute little turtle.  It was fun. We went home after we had dinner cause it was freaking cold.  Sunday we went to the giant Wegmans, and Giant Barns and Nobles of doom.  The book store was fun.  Wegmans was crazy.   I also got to see Casey practice for the musical.  It was fun.  But I had to come home Monday.  Stupid home.  Well time for work.  Laters."

She made me a turkey sandwhich and gave me a pickle with it.  YUM!!!  After that we went to the mall.  I bought more stuff than I probably should have. FYE didn't have the full metal alchemist dvd she wanted, and neither did Waldens.  Stupid mall stores.  So we ended up going to Borders.  They had the dvd's and the Full Metal Alchemist dvd she wanted.  It was fun.  After that we went to Friendly's.  I had a honey barbacue chicken strip basket, and Casey had quesidillos.  We shared my ice cream afterwards.  Then we went and saw Corpse Bride.  It was good.  Saturday I got a suprise, Casey showed up at like 3:30.  They did not need her at work till 7.  So we hung out and then she went to work.  Afterwards she came back and we watched Inuyasha and Full Metal Alchemist.  She spent the nice.  It was nice.  Today we had breakfast and then went and exchanged her costume, and got some fun stuff.  She got wings and a wig.  I got shot glasses and a electric blue wig.  So I am going to be a ghostbuster with blue hair.  :P  So after that I was pretty much a lazy kid.  Lazy is fun.  Well Thats all for now I guess.  Casey is the best.  I am a very lucky boy to have her.  And it is awesome getting to sleep next to her.  Even though I apparently hiss while I sleep.  Thats kinda weird.  Oh well.  I get to see her again on Tuesday.  Woo Hoo.  Nintendo Fusion Tour Wenesday.  Laters all."

Your seduction technique can be summed up with ""charm""
You know that if you have the chance to talk to someone...
Well, you won't be talking for long! ;-)

You're great at telling potential lovers what they want to hear.
Partially, because you're a great reflective listener and good at complementing.
The other part of your formula? Focusing your conversation completely on the other person.

Your ""sweet talking"" ways have taken you far in romance - and in life.
You can finess your way through any difficult situation, with a smile on your face.

I finally feel like my life is right about where I want it to be.  I met Caseys family last night.  They are cool.  I got to talk to her grandparents the most.  They seem really nice.  Last night we watched Labyrinth and Big Fish.  It was fun.  But the pizza gave me heat burn.  :P  Caseys dog Misty let me use her as a foot rest.  It was unintentional but fun.  I donno.  Its just been a really good week.  I kinda don't wanna go to work tommorow but oh well. I've got to learn to keep myself busy now.  I'm sure once I start the 11 o'clock I will be able to keep busy.  The one shift I am not looking forward to learning is the 5:30.  UGH!!!  Oh well, I'll just have to learn to go to bed early.  Haha.

"event","So I took a stupid quiz.  And I found a mario icon.  I know I'm a dork.  I also have free time they don't mix sometimes.  I've been reading gasp.  Oh and the quiz will be at the end of all of this.  So just be paitent.  So I read Fahrenheit 451, not to be confused with Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911.  Ones a movie, hte others a book by Ray Bradbury.  Who by the way is probably one of the greatest authors of all time.  Anyhoo I read the book again, haven't really read it since high school.  And its still great.  Especally the flame thrower.  *BIG GRIN* I'm not gonna ruin it incase you haven't read the book.  I think they are making a movie out of it too.  I will go see it.  And now I am reading a book called The Dante Club.  Its by a guy named Matthew Pearl and it is very cool.  It is set in 1865 right before the english translation of Dante's devine comedy is released.  Their is a serial killer copying the events Dante's poem on his victims.

I wanna get the whole House of M series.  That stuff is frigging good.  I know.  DORK.  But hey I'm happy.  LOL.  And comics books are better than soap operas anyways.  You can read them like 15 times in a day if you really wanted too.  Haha.  But anyways I wanna know what happens.  I wanna know if they wind up killing Wanda or if she gets better.  This crap is intretesting.  And addicting as well.  Oh and you never see them make videogames outta soap operas.  That would be freaky.  It would have to be like some fighting game, but like with I donno, ripping eachothers clothes off and throwing mud at eachother.  Like they dont have games like that already.  LOL.

Am I more than you bargained for yet
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet

Is this more than you bargained for yet
Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song

"event","I'm tired.  It was a long fun weekend.  It was Justin and Mary's wedding this weekend.  I was in the party.  Thursday we all met up at Eastview and got our tuxes.  Oh that was intresting.  All but two of the tux's had something wrong with them.  So after that the brides maids went there way and we headed back to Canandaigua.  We were gonna go to the El Rincon but it was closing so we went to Denny's.  So our waitress was Kailey who I used to work with it.  She didn't give us much service but we still gave her an 11 dollar tip.  So after that I went home and got some shut eye.  Friday I woke up and chilled for awhile then I started running around.  I had to go to Wegmans for cereal.  I wanted cocoa puffs.  I got them but I accidently bought reduced sugar.  Oh well they were still good.  I also got the party pack of smirnoff twisted.  So then I went to wal-mart. I had to pick up black socks, a belt, and a wedding card.  So then I stopped at game craze to get a used copy of san andres for Justin. I also grabbed a few sega games.  So then I came home and packed.  Then around 3:30 I left for Hornell.  NO getting LOST this time.  So we did the rehearsal.  We got yelled at for talking.  :P  But it went fairly well.  So after that we went and had dinner at the Elks club.  This was all in Hornell incase you didnt know where the wedding was. So we had dessert and sandwhiches.  Then we went home and drank and played videogames.  That was fun.  Justins family was camping in the backyard.  Mary went to spend the night with her parents.  So after Justins parents went out we watched Beast Master.  Well I started to.  This was actually well Mary and Justins family was still around.  I went outside on the porch and chatted with Justin and his family.  Oh yea we also lost Darren at wal-mart earlier.  He had went to Wegmans instead.  :P  It was funny.  But after Mary and the Family went to bed, we were goofy.  We got Lord Of The G-Strings on demand.  SO cheesey.  I fell asleep about 2 in the morning while the 7 girl orgy thing was going on.  Also the whole time we were watching movies we were playing San Andreas but without doing anything.  Saturday we woke up at 8:30 and did breakfest.  Played Sega games.  At 9 Justins brother in law started drinking.  We finished off the smirnoff before the wedding.  No one was drunk yet.  We woke Justin up about 9:55.  With a giant man pile.  We played some more sega and got ready for the wedding.  We got to the church around 1.  Me and Jermey got an early peek at Mary.  Her mom scolded us but wasnt mad cause we stopped Justin from seeing Mary.  We got the guest seated and the ceremony started.  The only mishap was when Mary just up and headed for the door.  Dont worry she just had to go to the bathroom.  So the wedding finished up.  We did pictures and showed them off.  They had a carriage ride so once they were off we headed to Ruperts.  Thats where the reception was.  We started off by Jeremy, Jochovha and Beth going to the open bar.  Beth and Darren are underage but still got served.  AWESOME. Every one but Darren got Margarita's.  Darren got Rum and Coke.  So Mary and Justin got their.  We did the horse dovers.  Then the toast and dinner.  After that we did the dancing.  And once all the bride and groom type dances were done we hammed it up.  Well the grooms men and grooms did.  It was a blast.  We danced with minimal drinkage.  I dance with the bridesmaids and peck.  And we just hammed it up.  Justins little brother Jared almost got punched by me.  He was being annoying.  But no punching happened.  After the reception we stopped at wegmans and headed back to Justin and Mary's aparment.  They stayed at a hotel.  We pretty much went to bed.  They threw my hoody I had been looking for at me.  I was passed out so I guess I called them an asshole.  This morning we woke up, went to brunch, went bowling, played pool and fuse ball.  After that we head home and that leads to now.  I'm heading out again.  I'm gonna visit Will and then Grube and Shana. Later."

I'm writing this because she said she would never read my journal again.  I can't stop her.  If she decides to read she will know that I still love her.  Not that she probably didn't know that.

"event","This year, as short as it has been has opened my eyes to certain things.  Like how Alisha has never really been there for me.  She trys to make it seem like she is but she really really isnt.  And its always been like that, even when we were dating.  Like yesterday she decided it would be a better idea to go work at Pondo cause she needs money.  Okay, fine. But she made this decision an hour before she was supposed to come over.  She assumed I would be cool with it, that I would be okay if she just came over after she was done working.  I spent fifteen dollars to make her dinner.  She didn't eat a damn thing.  She watched one and a half movies and left.  She didn't understand why I came into Pondo and gave her the movie told her to return it on wenesday.  She still came over but everything was ruined.  And I'm mad at Joe too.  Cause he called her in.  But from the sound of it he told her not to come in if she thought I would get mad.  Apparently she didn't think I would get mad.  But when three out of four times you bail on the person why wouldn't they?

I guess Tricia was right.  Alisha is just using me.  She keeps hurting me and doesn't give a damn.  No longer will I be the first to IM her.  If Bobby IM's me again and tells me to keep being friends with her I will tell him to shove his head up his fucking ass.  Cause I am sick of being hurt.  And I guess he doesn't really want me hanging out with Alisha because she said if I need face surgery she would pay for it.  News flash bitch.  I am not as fucking weak as you think.  If Bobby comes at me and starts swinging, I will get angry, and I'm not exactly the nicest person when I am angry.  Hell I scared half the people I knew at Pondo yesterday when I you ditched me to work.

I mean why do I let her to do this to me.  She had the nerve to ask me if I still loved her when I was pissed beyond all belief.  I just felt like saying save love for your fucking boyfriend.  Cause hes obviously head over heals for you. The day before he left he wanted to go play baseball with his friends.  And he got mad at you for wanting to spend time with her before he left.  What the hell, she almost didn't go to Myrtle Beach cause he was gonna miss her to much but he did not want to go.  So yeah, the only reason he did something with her Friday was because she yelled at him, when all he was trying to do was keep his head on straight.  I am so sorry that I wasted the last three years of my life trying to be there for you, doing whatever you asked me to, like asking Bobby if he liked you.

I am sorry Alisha but you have overstepped the boundries of friendship way to many times.  So fuck it.  Unless you see the errors of your way I am not going to deal with your bull shit anymore.  Have fun working at Ponderosa again, have fun with Bobby who clearly doesn't love you the way you love him.  And have fun without me in your life.  So goodbye.  Even if you never do see this.

And thank you Tricia for opening my eyes.  You have made me realize how stupid I am being.  She obviously does not care how I feel or she would not have done this last night.  

This quote is from New Found Glorys Christmas song X-miss.  
""This year I spent to much time and money on you.""

And this one is from Stroke 9.
""Well I wasted two years trying to make you mine, and I wasted two more as I missed every sign that you weren't what you seemed like you were which is fine, cause I don't know who I am most of the time.'

Later."

Uggh I hate being sick.  I get sick like once a year and it blows.  I'm gonna go now.  Somebody stop the lawn mower.  Its giving me a headache."

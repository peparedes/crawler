"event","I know that I haven't written in a while, but I have been busy. You know how it goes. But here it is for all those that asked about Oaks Day. For those of you that don't know, Oaks Day is also known as ""Ladies Day"" at the races, but for most involved it is just one big drunken pash-fest, and for my ease I will refer to it as ""Oaks"" for the rest of this.
It was last Thursday, the 6th, I believe. I rose early, showered and readied myself for the impending day. Wearing my suit, a plain white shirt and an awesome purplely pink shimmery tie (with matching cuff links) I was ready. I had alot to go through, my final exam, getting there on time, it was all happening. So I boarded the early train and did last minute exam prep while I took the half hour ride, then the hour ride down to Frankston. The time went fast enough, but by the end of the last trip I was over studying and looking at everybody else on every station I passed dressed up and ready to go.
Lorraine was nice enough to come and pick me up, brining me Macca's breakfast too, which was wonderful. Got to Uni. Every step I took, I got strange looks and whistles from all the girls I knew. I was looking pretty spunky. Everybody commented, which was awesome. I doesn't hurt to have your ego boosted. The three hour exam only took me just over an hour and a half, but I'm guessing that I knew what i was doing. Who knows, I'll get my marks back soon enough. That and I was just excited to go to the races. Kate who had kindly offered to drive me into the city, came about 10 minutes after I finished and we were on our way.
Although the forcast was for a change with a few showers, they were nowhere in site, and the sun was beaming straight down on to Melbourne that day. Absolutely beautiful. Wasn't warm enough yet to be sweating and sticky, but was nice all the same. Got to Spencer street and just had to follow the crowds to the station. Was easy to find. All I had to do was follow the streams of beautiful looking people. It was really nice to have so many people dressed up, looking their best and I was part of it. I loved it.
Got to Flemington, and was immeadiately lost. Knew that I had to get in somehow, but just did't know where. Tried to call friends. Wouldn't let me. Network overload, with 100,000 people trying to use their phones all at the same time. So I went in, and walked around. Tried the phone again. And success. Met up with Nads, Mel and Wade. Lost Libs, Pongo, Larrissa, Ryan and Phil in the process. So we decided to go and get drinks. I didn't know what I wanted. Wade said he buy me a bourbon, so I was happy with that, but with the amount of people, I really needed maybe a couple. Then I lowered my standards. The girl asked me what I wanted. I replied ""A bottle of that $20 champagne."" she followed with ""How many glasses,"" to which I rebutted ""Just the one."" I was on my way. Downing the Bourbon in less than 4 minutes, I started on my champagne. Wasn't overly bad, but then wasn't overly good either. But It was a quick booze up, so I was happy. Met up with everybody, caught myself in the middle of a fight, but survived it. And then the arguements that went on between the group and I kept myself out of it. Alot of bullshit. I just kept drinking, probably a little too fast for my liking, but I was forgetting about all their problems, and my eyes started to wander. So many women, so much cleavage, so much fake tan, so many g-bangers. I was unbelieveable. A true sight. 
Anyways, so me and Nads leave the arguements and bickering, to go and place a bet. Arm in arm, we wander along trying to find the betting. Put 10 bucks on Shane Dye whose the rider who Nads said that he always wins. He didn't win. So we wandered back. The group decided to move somewhere where we could sit and drink and watch, so we moved in procession to find a spot. Settled and needed more alcohol, so three more bottles of bubbly came. Wow, by the time 6pm came around, we were all so damn drunk, so sunburnt and so happy, it was the best time I've had in a LONG time. 
Through the festivities, and due to great alcohol consumption, I found that I was kissing Nads a whole lot. And she was loving it, and to my great suprise so was I. So I had an attachment for the rest of the day. We all left the track and went back into Southbank to PJ O'Briens where I paid a staggering $7 for a beer, and not only that I bought 5. 4 to drink, and well one spilt so I had to buy another. But it was a rip off. Stayed there for an hour or so, but I was starving, so I decided to go and get some food. Nads came with. We talked and shared a bottle of wine over steaks, and just talked and enjoyed each others company. Made our way back down to PJ's, and kept drinking and dancing to the live band that had appeared in our absence. We were all drunk as all hell by that stage. This was 1am. So it'd been for me 13 hours straight drinking, and well for the rest of them, it was more like 18. But hey, it was home time. 
I went back to Nad's house with Libs and her, and as Libs was waiting for Pongo to get back from the casino. (By the way he walked in the door at 8:30 the next morning) and watched movies. I fell asleep lying next to Nads on the couch, and then after Resident Evil was done, and Kindergarten Cop was on, she dragged me to her bed. Sleeping next to someone, is really something that I have missed. But next to her, it was just nice. SPOONING! I really did just feel quite at peace.
Got up early the next morning, at like 10, and Nad's drove me home. I had spent 30 hours straight in my suit, and I really needed a shower. But Oaks Day was the most fun that I've had all year, and all I can say is that I can't wait to go back again next year.
To the best time of my year to date.
Till later ...."

"event","My head is still swimming with everything that has happened this weekend. And now I really struggle to remember all of it. I guess it all started Thursday night. I was working like I normally do on a Thursday night in the bar, and Nads was there (not working, drinking) with Pongo, Wade and Mel. Now, I get an invite from Nads to say that they were drinking coz it was Pongo's last day, and that they were going to his new work Daisy's to have a few because he was working the night, that I should go with them on their drinking bonaza. I toss up the idea. It is the first time that I would be going further than the bar to drink with these people, and well, the first time is always the hardest once your out of work. I knew I had to do study on Friday, and that I didn't have the money to get a cab out there or back, so I decide to drive. So I finish at 9:30, and the bar is still going. Half the bistro staff were sitting have their knockoffs, and I sit there wanting to have a smoke, and a non-alcoholic beverage, before I leave. I'm talking to Kristin and Greg. They want to come to Daisy's. Beautiful! So we jump in the car and head down to Ringwood. Now Daisy's isn't what I'd call a cool place. Actually it's renouned for it's 'over 28' nights. But I went with good intentions not to bag the place out cold. Get there, and there is nowhere to park. Like 150 carspots, and nowhere to park. Drove around a little. Leaving my car once we found one in the back corner, kinda made me nervous, so I took my stereo faceplate in Greg's bag.
As we stepped through the doors, we were hit with the most crowded venue I think I have ever been in. There were people everywhere. It was PACKED to the roof. It took 10 minutes to get from the foyer bar to the bar bar. That's where Pongo was working. Went up to the bar, jug of Draught, gave a 20, got 16 back. Now I know that that math can't be wrong. Had a few drinks, then settled back to stand and chat to people. Looking around I remembered why it was so crowded. Also remembered why there were so many 16-17 year olds in there as well. School finished that day, for all the year 12's, so all the legal 18's were out and all their underage friends. However, that doesn't mean it was an absolute perve fest. I was checking out left right and centre, and there was just tits, tits, tits. It was great. Went to go and find the missus who was out on the dance floor. Took 15 minutes to get 10 metres because of the closeness of everyone, but I didn't mind having to touch a girls ass to say excuse me, and then to have her check me out, well that's prolly why it took longer 5 minutes to get to her. But found her, and then dragged her off the dancefloor, and she insisted on being introduced to work people. So I took her and introduced her to Greg and Kristin. That's all that were there at that stage. Then she left. She wasnt' drinking, or driving, and her friend that was driving wanted to go. Said our goodbyes, and i was free to check out Daisy's by myself.
Hours later, as my friends got drunker, and with a short interlude of Kristin leaving, with Greg following her, I tried to get her to get my faceplate off Greg before she left to put it in my car. They were out of earshot, and in the time it took her to get her jacket from the car Greg had dissapered, drunk off his balls, STILL with my faceplate in his bag. I was spewing. I couldn't get over the fact that he had it in his bag and there was nothing I could do about it. Dammit. I knew that he was working on the next day and I would be able to get it from him, but I wanted music in my car. :-( But the night continued, until they kicked us out, and I drove Nads home. Went in and had some water to drink, and a couple of smokes, just sitting there talking about everything and nothing. Left around 5 to come home.

Friday:
For the life of me I can't remember what I did on friday. I think I slept most of it away, but I know that I worked that Friday night. I was meant to close the Bistro bar so that'd give me a couple of hours to have a drink or two. Saw Larissa though, and that brightened my whole day, because her smile does that do me somehow? Anyways, we were flat out everywhere. It was a nut house. Just crazy. Ended up getting asked to go into the public bar to help them out for the last part of my shift. Larissa, Greg, Wade and Tanya were all on the other side of the bar drinking and I wasn't. Finished up at 11:30, and had the beer I was dying for. Managed to get Larissa to hang around for another hour so I could chat to her. Talked about Oaks Day coming up. It's the last day of my exams. I have it at 9:30 till 12:30. So I have decided instead of driving down, then driving back to catch the train in (as it would be too late) that I'd catch the train down, which means I'll get up really early, dress in my suit and tie, and study on the train on the way down to Frankston. Lorraine is going to pick me up from the station and take me to uni, then I'll sit the exam, get Lorraine to pick me up and get me back to the train and then get my ass over to Flemington for the races. I have it all set, I got my suit all dry cleaned, my shirt and tie picked, my new shades and the new digital camera which will give me memories of the drunken day/night. All my friends are going to be starting to drink at around 8am, and so I'm going to have to play catch up, and I can't wait. Made it home, and passed out at 2am.

Saturday:
Up early to go to work at the library. Then straight from there to the blackburn. It was the Cox Plate so the public bar was packed with people placing bets on the horses. 5 hours there, and I was on a break. Rob came and visited me, and we chatted for the hour and a half that I had off. I don't see him or talk to him as much now that he has his new job. He works really really hard for it, and the money that he's making I'm sure that he'll be sitting comfortably for when we move out together. Back to work, and another 5 hours later, I closed the public bar, and went out to see the missus. She just got over that time of the month, so it was really good to see her again. We had the best sex that I think we'd ever had. There was nobody home at her house, so she really got into it. Slept there till late Sunday morning.

Sunday:
Woke up, and went home around 1pm. Ate some and just chilled out. Rob was coming over as we were going to go and buy some stuff. We went to Shoppo so he could finish his contract with Telstra. Then headed off to JB Hi Fi, for some stuff. I bought 3 DVD's, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Matrix and Matrix 2. He bought two Strapping Young Lad albums as preparation for going to the concert next Saturday I think it is. Then we went to Billy Hyde music to look at guitars. They were having a sale, but to start something like that you would still need over a grand to get something half decent. So he decided, no guitar today. We turned around to go back to JB for a stereo, when I said go the good guys first because you 'pay less pay cash'. Found the same stereo he wanted, and it was less for cash. Ended up paying 455 for it, which isn't bad. It's gotta really nice sound to it. And Hopefully he's at home enjoying it now. Went home and started watching 2 Fast 2 Furious before I went to work. I love cars. Work was shit boring, but some people made us hang around for some time while we tried to get out early as possible.
It was the official day for Pongo's last drinks for working at the Blackburn and it was at the Manhattan. So I finished at 9:30, smoke and drink, then home, changed and back out. As I rocked up, they were all leaving, well being kicked out to be honest. They were going back to Libby and Nads' house for more booze. And there was heaps of it. A bottle of Canadian Club, 2 bottles of bacardi, a bottle of white wine, a bottle of vodka and a bottle of baileys. And that's just what they bought at the bottle shop there. 
Back at their house we got stuck into it. Some had already had enough. Music was cranked, and drinking between like the 15 of us was rolling on through the night. It was a very interesting night, including us all stripping off our top halves (girls included), a manager and a waitress getting it on in one of the bedrooms, a security guard being so pissed that he passed out in the laudry but not before puking all over himself, his pillow, his inflatable mattress, and Leah yelling at Alex and Tim to stop making fun of her every 5 minutes. And of course Pongo and Paul in tears over his forceful leave from such a great place. And the Blackburn won't be the same without Leigh Matthew Pongo. I'll tell you that right now. Ran out of booze, so I drove to Wade's house with Wade and Nads, and got more Bacardi and Dope. Came back, this time without Wade which we instructed not to do. Kept on going through the night, and in the end it was just Tim, Nads, Libs, Leah and myself, finishing off the dope and the drink. Found out from Libby, that both Nads and Larissa would rape me in a second if they could. Which is always a bit of an ego booster, but you know. 4:30 took drunken, stoned, aggressive Tim home, and made it to my bed by 5am. 

Monday:
2pm. I get up, and start writing on this. Now I'm going to go watch one of my new DVD's before I have to go to work again. 

Check ya...."

"event","Oh dear god it has just been far too long since I chose to write in this. Been busy I guess. That or lazy take your pick. But three weeks it's taken me to get my ass back to writing in here. It's funny actually, those three weeks I've had off from school, so I had the time to write. Go figure. Anyways.

I will start off with Friday and Saturday. The weather was absolutely TOP NOTCH! I love the first days of summer. Even though it's still another month and a bit off, you can tell it's coming. With the heat and the fact it came from out of nowhere and so suddenly, meant everybody was trying to take advantage of it. Therefore, this meant that any chicks were wearing shorter skirts, smaller and lower cut tops, and letting themselves be seduced by the sun. These are the days that I praise. Made me wish I had gone to Chadstone on Friday, just to look around at the girls walking past. I have never been to a place where people actually dress up for a shopping centre. But, on days like this, I just have to go with the flow.

I was up early. 5am to be precise. Promised my mum to take to her to airport. The lucky bitch got a free flight to Bali for the weekend. All expenses paid, except for I think it was one meal and spending money. But I guess that's the perks of a travel agent. So I get there still half asleep, and wander round looking at stuff. She had to check in with the few people she was going with. Macca's breakfast. Always a must. Scoffed it down, hungry as all hell. Got back to ma, and was on the hunt for the Beach Express store that was on this side of the customs gates. Was all the way over in domestic. We had time, so we went for a walk. Found it on the other side of the domestic security metal detectors (pain in the ass for change). And there they were. The new pair of sunglasses that would last for (I'm hoping) the next few years of my life. Beautifully crafted Oakleys. $350 (Christmas Present). $300, duty free. Mum is getting them duty free, along with my Beam and carton of ciggies. So I leave her back up at international, and begin my trecherous journey back towards home during peak hour traffic. Took me a half hour to get out to the airport. Took me an hour and 20 minutes to get back home. It was insane. I have never stopped on a freeway before. Small accident I passed on the way was the major contribution to this. The sun glare was horrible, and I didn't have my new sunnies to protect my sensitive eyes!
Dropped off Splinter Cell back at Blockbuster, and on the way back (8:30am this was) I drove past Our Lady's college in Box Hill. All the year 12's were dressed as cheerleaders, wearing skimpy clothing and shaking around pom poms. All the trees were covered in toilet paper. Driving past in the FTO, and well I certainally got some attention. A huge scream arose after beeping the horn a couple of times.

Chilled at home. It was my day off, I was going to be productive. Sat on the couch watching tv, and fell asleep. Went out for lunch with my grandmother, and her friends June and John. It was John's 87th birthday, and he is still going strong. Still driving which scares me somewhat as I hate old farts driving. Had a really nice piece of grilled Schapper served with a garlic butter. It was really tender. Melted in my mouth. Tasty as.

Worked the library the afternoon. Went and checked out taboo tattoo on whitehorse road, and there was a couple of things I saw that were interesting. Thinking of getting one when my mum and sister are in Malaysia. Too much bullshit stuff though. Like too hardcore. Not enough mellow stuff. Even the cute little bunny rabbits have to have evil red bloodshot eyes and their fangs showing. But I saw something that'd cost me like $230, and I'm seriously contemplating getting it.

Went to Vivaldi to dinner in the city with Gemma. It was the first time we'd been out together since the whole break thing happened. And that was like a week ago. I sometimes feel that I am talking to a rock, and then when I stop paying attention she gets all shitty at me. I don't understand, but then that's women. Who knows. I'll leave that whole thing to another time. But on the upside had the Rib Eye, and it was mad. A little overcooked, but ok all the same. It was good meat, and if you have good meat, if it's not cooked the way you like it, it's still edible.

When the Vivaldi crew had finished up working, we all went down to Zanzibah, and got pissed as all hell. The Shiraz that I had with the dinner, the vodka, apricot, peach tea contraption that Ercan made me, and bourbon after bourbon down there, it was just a little too much for this little fella. So I did what any normal human being would do, left and rode the last train for the night. It's always an interesting journey. The bums, the people from work, the young girls giggling about the punks at other end of the carriage. I was just hoping for a seat, didn't get one. But made it ok, and all the way home, no dramas. Passed out.

Saturday morning I knew I had to be up early, but to be woken up by mum giving us a call was so not cool. Talked to her, she had my glasses, then gave her back to Em. The phone rings again. Em, since she still had it, answers and hands it straight to me. It was Rob. It was 9:30am. Rob was never up at this time. I didn't put two and two together that he was actually still up, and totally wasted from his drinking. I found out today, that around 3:30am on saturday morning, he left from Barcode in Crown, and decided to walk home. A trip that's close to 15km. When he called, he failed to mention to me that he was still walking home from the city. He really was blind that night. Had Katie feeling him in places he didn't want to be felt, and well Duncan, Duncan isn't the type that gets manhandled. BUt the Katie is a sex freak, she just does anything with a pulse. (Just quickly, this one time at the glenferrie, she started on guys. got nowhere. went to girls. nowhere. Asked couples. nowhere. was last seen going into the city for a pro. I'm telling you this girl has issues, but anyways) So that was their crazy Friday night, and if i'd have known, I would have gone with them.
Worked ALL day Saturday. Library in the monring. Blackburn from 1 - 6, then 6:30 - 11:30. Caufield Cup too, which meant it was packed and it was busy. Finished early though, like 11:15, and Paul was managing so we got free piss all night. Rocky III came on and we were all in for the long haul. Drinking and kicking back, when we have the whole bar to ourselves with all the tv's tuned to Rocky, it's absolutely awesome. I was also lucky (?) enough to find out what Feltching is. For those that don't know, it's a gay thing. When a guy is doing another guy in the ass, blows his load, and then sucks it out of the other dudes ass with a straw. I was not amused. It was 28 (82 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, not that I got to see any of it. But the night was absolutely beautiful. One of those ones, where you would have had a barbeque, and just sit and chill all night long listening to some tunes. Drove (shhhh) home, as it's only less than 2 minutes away. And passed out in bed.

Today the cold change came through, rained, and that was it. The nice weather gone. But still got up late and watched the end of Monsters Inc that was on the Disney Channel. Rob called, and we chatted. Went to Chaddy to look for some stuff for him. Didn't find anything. We got there at 4. We straight to the food court. Ate. Realised the place closed at 5. We had 10 minutes to look in K-Mart. Didn't see what he was after. Left. And that was our trip. Feeling a little bambozled by it all, I made the plan to go to the Donny Inn, and place a few bets on the dogs and having a beer or two. Had two, and lost $10 overall, which wasn't too bad in my books.

Dinner was over at Gem's. Stayed there till 11, came home, watched another 48 hours. Eddie Murphy back in his funny days. He was losing it in this one, but he still had a bit of it. Nothing like Delerious or Beverly Hills Cop, but you know still had him. 

Another week of Uni to go. Then exams. My last exam (6th) is Oaks Day. I have made the plan to go to Oaks day after the exam. It finishes at 12:30, and well I want to make it there in time to drink a whole lotta booze. So I have made the decision to catch the train to the exam with my bag, dressed in suit and all. Then get Lorraine to pick me up from the exam and hold on to my bag, and catch the train back into Flemington for the races. Drinking Crownies and placing bets is what you should do after you've finished your exams for the year. It would be a mad day. But I'll see how it all goes anyways.

I will however try to keep this more updated. Just need to get the motivation."

"event","The lions have taken out the grand final flag for the third year running, and that hasn't been done in 50 odd years. They won against Collingwood yesterday afternoon, in cold but sunny conditions. The game was fierce with the lions winning by a 50 point margin. 9 goals is a HUGE margin, especially in a grand final. But since I go for the Kangaroos, it don't make a lick of difference to me.
Worked all of yesterday for the footy, and then all of last night, racking up a few hours. I have to go to my dad's work today to print out a whole bunch of info for my upcoming exams. I have three weeks off now, which is absolutely fantastic, then a week back at uni, then another week of exams, then I'm done for FOUR WHOLE MONTHS! I am so happy to think of that. but I can't fail again this year, because I can't get booted out of my course. I need to pass, need to get my ticket to travel, work and ALWAYS have a job.
Working tonight. Then going out for Benny's birthday. Should be good. But now I need to have a shower. Did you know that to help out the water restrictions they are trying to promote 4 minute showers? HAHAHA, like that's ever gonna work!"

"event","Apart from the fact that I was lucky enough to sleep in until 1PM today, it's been quite the good day overall. And for that I'm actually kinda happy. Happy like I have a smile on my face now, remembering what I was doing and the feelings that I had.
It all started off slow, as most things do when you get up at 1PM. I was actually lucky enough to sit and talk to my ex, Ashley, online for like an hour and a half. It was the first time that we'd spoken civilly and rationally in a good 15 months. Probably about the length of time of my new phone contract. But hey, there was no tension, even though there has been before. And I do regret the fact that we weren't like this when I visiting NY earlier this year, because she really is a very beautiful person, and funny, and well after the thousands of miles, I miss her. But we talked like old friends, like we used to. It was actually really nice. And I think from that I have had a smile on my face since that conversation started. I'm guessing that you only know what I'm talking about if you've done it before. And the best thing about it all now, is that we are just cool.
I had to work at 4, and it was a great night, because I was working with Leah, Nicole and the other Daniel in the Sports Bar. And well, all the alcoholic workies that rock up and drink into the earlier evening were all there, making it pleasant. I am getting to know more of my work colleagues better now, and it makes it easier for me to be a smart ass then. At 6:30 I moved to the Bistro Bar, and well, working with all the girls and the big haired Blair made it really easy going. We weren't that busy but it was nice enough. Humourous and enjoyable, what work should be like. So it was really comfortable. Everybody is now saying hi to me, and waving when they see me. I am almost a part of them. If only I knew all of their names. But I'm guessing that'll just come with time.
Finished work at 10, and made my way to join the others that were in the Sports bar having knock offs. I knew them all, and it was just hilarious. I don't' think that I've met funnier people, or more open women about their sex lives. But what even funnier, the gay 47 year old dishy, thought I was cute. But apparently he wasn't the only one. One of the girls, for the life of me I can't remember her name (might be all the beer in me) but apparently she likes the way that this Dan swings. Very nice looking girl too. But I am still tossing up about dating inside work. I have always said that it would never work. And others have agreed, but I would have to test the waters out myself. You can only really learn from your mistakes. So all and all, my night has been very good. Oh and I'm really lucky now that I live 2 minutes away from work, and that it's all backstreets, because otherwise I'm going to have start leaving my car there. I can't keep drinking and driving like this. It's not good. And I don't' condone it at all. But I'm glad I made it home in one piece. I won't make a habit of it.
But more importantly, it's AFL Grand Final tomorrow between Brisbane Lions and Collingwood Magpies, so the tension in the air has risen somewhat, even though since there's not two Melbourne based teams in it, that it's not worth it. But Brisbane won last years Grand Final against Collingwood. This year, who knows. I haven't got any money on it, and I don't go for either. (Carn the Roos!) So I really don't care, but I'll be working the sports bar, and well, it'll be cruisey during the quarters, and hell during the breaks, but I'll love every second of it, because I can still watch the game.
Going to bed now. Starting to be too drunk.
Oh and being this inebriated isn't good for typing in a virtual journal"

"event","You know when you have heaps of stuff running through your head and you don't know where to go or where to start in sorting out all these thoughts and feelings, well I'm right there, right now. I am meant to be studying for a test that starts in an hour and a half, but I can't clear my head enough to study adequately. I don't want to think about it. I don't want to deal with it. I can't be bothered. I don't care. But I know I do. The question is, do I let something go, that I think is really good, or keep it and have this continually happen. It is a common catch-22. Deep down I want to let it go, and I know that I'd be happy for the time being. But I have had visions of a future, like a real half decent future. And that's what makes me think that I should keep it. I think that I just need time. And I think that by not responding to messages, it doesn't help, but when they are abusive, what are you meant to say. There would be a big part of my life gone. But I would have more time to myself. I could go and do what I wanted, no questions asked. Not having to wonder about trying to fit time in, or just have to spend all that money of phone calls, food, movies, presents, etc etc.
The more I think about it, the angrier i get. I don't want to think about it. I have better things to do than stress over something that is sounding less worth it every second that i sit here and type. I have to go and study."

"event","After an exhausting weekend, there was nothing that I wanted more than to sleep all of Monday. I needed to go to Uni though. I went to the Nursing Prac lecture, but skipped the Ethics lecture so that I could go and get a hair cut and talk to a dude in Frankston about my new phone, which I get on the 12th of October when my contract expires. They have the coolest phones now. All in colour, all with cameras, all that can send sms and mms, loudspeaker, heaps of battery life, and those crazy polyphonic ringtones. I am tossing up between the Nokia 7250 or 6800, Panasonic GD88 or the Siemens SL55. Maybe if I'm desperate I'll go on the SOny Ericsson T610. But I just don't know. There are too many out there, and if it's going to be for the next 15 - 24 months, I want to make sure I like it.
I went to visit my god daughter Jorja who is now only 6 weeks old, starting to open her eyes and look up at me now when I look down. She is so beautiful. Lorraine, her mother, is doing weel and always asks how i am going with my friends, family and girlfriend. And it always seems to be complaints about my sister. But that's just normal at the moment while she is going out with that stupid ass bald headed ugly mother fucker of a hungarian jew (not that I have anything against bald people, hungarians or jews, it's just that that's what he is, and that's to what I refer him as).
Last night Gemma came over and we watched something of her choice from Video Ezy. It was called 'tape'. And I implore anyone, do not see this movie. It is the crappiest movie I have really seen in a long time. And it's stuff like that I really don't want to be shelling out $6 to see. Oh well. That's another movie to the blacklist.
Now I got up mid morning today, had scrambled eggs on toast, and it's time for me to go to Uni. Only have two tutorials for ethics and nursing prac, so they shouldn't be too bad. We get to insert catheders into dummies, and then when we go out on clinicals we can do it to real people, well chicks anyways. Can't do it on guys, simply because their urethras are like 25cm longer than a chicks.
But anyways, hopefully gonna go out for a drink or something tonight, maybe tomorrow night. I don't know yet, but I know that Rob and me will go to B73, hopefully when it's not as crowded as last week.
SHit now, I'm running late...."

"event","Well what a weekend it was. Started all I guess on Friday. Worked like a crazy man for 8 hours straight before getting let out an hour early, which granted was nice. Home, changed, then out to the city for the night with Em. Started off with the old workies from Vivaldi at Zanzibah. Had a few drinks, some donated generously by Adrian, and had the pleasure of listening to the dude up on the rise with his guitar. As we were the only ones to really appreciate him being there, he played to us, and what we wanted. So there was a few requests going on. Piano man, Drive, Khe Sahn and a very funny version of Drops of Jupiter which none of us knew the words, so he ended up giving us the song sheet. Jay and his girlfriend, Elle, were there and we were able to set things straight between the whole car thing, which was good. Me and em were met by mum and dad, who had been at ""We will Rock you"" for the night, and which they enjoyed thoroughly (The best Fathers DAy present by Far (and by price)). We left for the casino, with intentions for food and gambling. Both we did. And well the gambling didn't go as well as I'd planned, and ended up losing a bit of money to my dismay. 4am I was back in bed. But only for a few hours, coz at 9 I was up again for work.
12pm I was home and Rob was waiting for me. We left for Rosebud, and it was a beautiful day for Golf. Ended up screwing up the first two holes, so we didn't count it, even though we got a couple of pars along the way. The first signs of better weather were there, with me picking up a little bit of colour from my two hours out on the greens. We continued down to my house at Sorrento where we started drinking and cooking up a storm. 7:30 and other Rob came to pick us up with his new girlfriend Bec, who was in fact a scientist. One smart cookie I'll tell ya. And I think that Rob is very happy to be with her. Other ROb (the golfing one) has now found the kind of girl he wants to date. Good looking scientist. He's always looking for smart women, but says that that's just an oxymoron. So that's opened up a new path for him. We then went back to the Rye Scout Hall for Sonja's 21st. The VB was openly handed around as we met her family and some of her friends. Both Rob's had the joy (I think it was a joy!?) of talking to Sonja's 90 year old grandmother for a good half an hour each. It was a nice night, and me and Rob were pretty drunk by this stage. We decided it would be better to walk home than catch a cab. 8 and 1/2 Km's and 2 hours later we walked in the house. For 5 of those Km's Rob carried a garage sale sign home that I'd removed from a street sign. He woke up sore this morning. Well this afternoon. We got up at 2, and made a bit of food, cleaned and left. I had work at 6 tonight. And work, well work just kept on going and going and going. For a sunday night, it was busy as. We didn't have enough staff on, not expecting it to be busy, and well I can say that it was very tiring being half hungover with exhausted legs. But I was able to get friendlier with Jodi, one of the many hotties that I work with. So all in all a good weekend. Earning money, drinking, sport and recreation all rolled into one. But I think bed is a better way to go now.
I only have another week at Uni, until I get three weeks off for mid semester break, so I'm looking forward to having a bit of time for myself. And I guess I could study. I probably need to. But those weeks off will tell."

"event","Well what can I say, except that Erin you are the best, and without your help, I wouldn't have been able to beat Kevin to having this journal thing.

The sun is shining once again. And it is a mild day. The sun hasn't shined like this in a good 4 months. Summer, is coming back, and this year, hopefully will be warmer than the last. Busy day ahead, so I won't be able to enjoy it unfortunately. I have to work at the library for a little while, and then come home and get changed before I goto work at the pub. It's going to be a long day. But as soon as 9:30 hits, I'm outta there.
Zanzibah will be the first stop in for an hour or so. Then I'm meeting up with my parents and then going to the casino. A late night supper, with drinks and gambling to finish the night. Should be good.

However there is always a catch. I have to be up early, to play golf down in Rosebud with Rob. But I should be able to nap in the afternoon before Sonja's 21st. But a busy weekend ahead. And the best bit. Being down the beach for Sunday when it's going to be 26 baby YEAH!"

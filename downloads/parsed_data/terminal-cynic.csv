"event","I'm on a long road, riding my bicycle. The traffic is going against me, as the road is one-way. I know that just a block over is the road going my way, but I don't take it. Before long, the rain is beating against me, soaking my jeans and my t-shirt. As I ride I recognize various landmarks alongside the road, buildings from all over. A school I used to drive past, the office where my father used to work. They are all there, alongside the road. I pedal faster, growing tired but never stopping. I know that I have to get home for something, then turn around and make the long ride back.

But I feel as if the journey will last forever."

I worry that my son might not understand what I've tried to be. And if I were to be killed, Willard, I would want someone to go to my home and tell my son everything. Everything I did, everything you saw, because there's nothing that I detest more than the stench of lies. And if you understand me Willard, you will do this for me. Everybody wanted me to do it, him most of all. I felt like he was up there, waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to go out like a soldier, standing up, not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead, and that's who he really took his orders from anyway."

There was no understating the necessity of my action, but still I had doubts. Logic is good, but there's always conscience in the back of your head telling you that you'll be caught, that you'll never get away.

Secondly, I'd like to shave my girl's kitty for her. She's on board with this, of course. However, having never had one of my own, I'm not sure on the proper care. Do any of you fine ladies have some advice for me on how to do this and make it fun? I'd sure appreciate it!

"event","I'm downtown, it's late. I can see my breath in the air, although it's April. I'm walking along, just minding my own business. The bars and clubs are letting out, so people are pouring out onto the streets. Nameless, shapeless, most of them drunk, still trying to make that last-minute hook up. I immediately hate them all.

I find a quiet spot near the Claddaugh Pub and stand, watching. The crowds cross the street, walking this way and that. It reminds me of ants in an ant farm. I had an ant farm once, those guys didn't grow shit. Among them I happen to catch sight of a bum. He's filthy, nearly wearing rags, and holding a small styrofoam cup. He doesn't say a word, he just shakes the cup, making a <I>jungle jungle</I>. Most people walk past, trying to pretend to have not seen him. Some throw change in the cup, the occasional person donates a whole bill. When they do, he pockets it. It probably doesn't pay to flash too much cash in his profession.

I leave my position and walk toward him. The crowd has moved across the street now, and he is left standing on the corner alone. I walk toward him and he freezes. I think he's a little bit scared of me, indicating that he's smarter than he looks. People like this have highly attuned senses of danger. Their lives are about as close to life in the wild as anybody could get anymore, and they are keenly attuned to their environments. Most of them eventually get so depressed they give it up and freeze, or starve, but until then they are true human animals. That is the downfall of higher intelligence, of course, emotions. I reflect on how lucky I am to have disconnected most of mine, especially considering what I must now do.

I walk to within and arm's length of the bum. He eyes me warily and, after a moment, extends the cup (<I>jingle jingle</I>).

""You hungry?"" I ask. I hold up a twenty dollar bill, then drop it in his cup. His eyes grow wide, and he nods. ""Tired?"" He nods again, tears begin to form in his eyes. ""Then thank the Lord that we met tonight. You know, the good Lord works in mysterious ways, and I believe he has this evening. I'm a minister, see, and I believe that the Lord Jesus has, in his eternal grace, sent me to you or you to me. We were made to meet tonight by providence! As the good book says: Go, men of Israel, and find those who wandereth and bringeth them home to sup! Ezekiel 21:36 [I've made this quote up]. Do you believe in the power of the Lord, Jesus?"" He nods, of course. He wants whatever I'm about to give him and he'll say anything to get it.

I'm laying on a bit of a southern accent which, somehow, seems to always add credibility to the minster bit, and I continue.

""Right this way, brother. We'll get you all set up."" I'm laying it on thick as I bring him across the road with me, to my secret little space near the Claddaugh. ""We have a program, you see, wherein we help those in need to get back on their feet."" I continue blabbering, and he's spellbound. I don't know where he thinks I'm taking him, but he's probably not even paying attention anymore. It isn't until we reach 'the spot' as I have nicknamed it in my mind, that I lose the act. I give a quick look-around to assure myself that there are no witnesses.

""You know what? This program probably isn't for you. In fact, I'm pretty sure that Jesus has different plans for you."" He doesn't even see the knife, the way I bring it expertly around the back of his head, and draw it across his throat. Maybe he thought I was throwing an arm around him, but I'm actually trying to avoid touching him as much as possible. I saw through his throat to the spine. he makes a strange gurgling, the first noise he's made so far, and I become overcome with a fit of the giggles. I begin stabbing at his body (he tries to cover himself with his hands, but death is coming quickly) while singing <I>Jesus Loves Me, This I Know</I>. I can't remember most of the words, so I substitute phrases like, ""filthy bum is dying so!"" and such.

When he finally collapses, his head hanging of of his neck at a grotesque angle, the pool of blood spreading quickly, I wipe the knife on the cleanest part of his clothing, and then walk away as if nothing has happened, making sure to retrieve my twenty.

I'm always amazed by the amount of blood in the human body. I'm told it's only pints, but when you cut someone really well, get the jugular, it seems like gallons of the stuff pours out, like sweet, red wine. The next day he will be discovered by a young couple, only a few years older than me. The paper will run a story on the fifth page, explaining in two succinct paragraphs that a bum was murdered, probably as the result of a feud with another vagrant. They will neglect to mention that his money was not taken, and that the weapon was not found.

"event","The party starts early, but I don't get there until late. No real reason, I just felt like getting there late. The crowd is moving, already drunk, while what I think is a remastered version of <I>Nosferatu</I> is projected on them. The music is loud, pulsing, rythmic. All techno sounds the same. The first keg is already empty, but the second has just been tapped. A lot of people have brought thier own. People have already pared off, swaying drunkenly, some openly groping. I pass a guy with his hand down some girls pants. She's moaning loudly but no one seems to take notice of her. As I walk by I grab the waistband of his boxer shorts and pull up sharply, he screams (really more of a squeal) and she shrieks in pain as he jerks his fingers out of her to rescue his underwear from his asshole. He spins around, looking for a fight, but I'm already gone.
<I>Love matches, so called, have illusion for their father and need for their mother.
-Friedrich Nietzsche</I>
Somewhere far away the song changes as I pump the tap. Someone saunters up, a guy. He starts talking to me, and I respond with grunts and single syllables. Finally he says, ""Hey, I got some pot in my room. Wanna smoke?"" I realize he's hitting on me.
""No one calls it pot anymore.""
He starts. ""What?""
""No one calls it pot anymore."" I repeat.
""Wha- what do they call it?"" he asks, obviously shaken by my sudden eloquence.
I make something up, quickly, ""Uh, romulan... spock, uh, juice.""
""Romulan spock juice?""
""Yeah.""
""Like, <I>Star Wars</I>?""
I think, <I>Star TREK</I> you faggy asshole, but instead I respond, ""Yeah, sure.""
""So, you wanna go... smoke some romulan spock juice?""
There's a long pause before I respond.
""Did you know that the human head weighs about seven pounds?""
""That's, uh, a lot.""
""Not so much if you carry it in something with handles. A gym bag or something.""
After awhile he says quietly, ""Are you crazy?""
For the first time I look him in the eye.
""Define crazy.""
He stands for a moment before backing away. I think he read that as a threat and, while I didn't intend it that way, I don't mind that he thinks that.

I walk back to the other side of the huge room, passing a philosophy professor I recognize, tounging some underage freshman. She reminds me of some girl I knew over a year ago who, one night, completely out of the blue (or so her friends would later say), went into the dorm showers while everyone was at the Solstice party, lit some votive candles on the edge of the bathtub, undressed and took off her jewlery, and then slit her wrists. She was found the following morning by some girl's boyfriend who had slept over (completely violating school rules, although no one was going to press the issue, considering) in a tub full of blood and water. He didn't come forward until a week later. The first person to report it was another girl who, having just broken up with her boyfriend over the phone on the anniversary of the annual Thanksgiving Turkey drop, had run into the showers to cry, maybe even to slit her own wrists. The police said that this dead girl must have really meant it because she cut had once on each wrist, right up the vein. Remember kids, up the road, not across the street. Make sure the job's done right.

The party rolls on all around me. I don't know why anyone tries. Parties at this school suck, I don't know why anybody tries. Some girl stumbles over to me. She's not gorgeous, but she's semi-attractive. Dyed blonde, pretty good skin, skinny, no tits. Her name is Amy. After the usual pleasantries we go back to her room (in the shittiest dorm on campus) and fuck. In the middle of it I'm trying to figure out why I can't come. I'm trying, I flip her over (she's petite) and fuck her from behind. Still nothing. I've grown bored, though, so I fake a weak orgasm (she's had hers twice, once when I went down on her, which was mostly to get me started, and then again, later), whip the rubber off and toss it in the trash can. It misses, hits the wall and sticks. I leave it there. She rolls over, leans against me, runs her hand across my chest. I hate fucking when I can't come. What's the point?
""That was amazing."" she says.
'I know', I think. These little college hardbodies have never really been laid, never really been laid by a real casanova. A couple moves out of the <I>Playboy Advisor</I> and they think I'm the master. I hate an easy audience. What's a victory worth if it takes no effort?
""Do you want to go again?""
I could. I could blow her mind. I could slap on another rubber, go at it again, fake another orgasm, keep this up all night. She'd probably brag to her friends about it, too. But... no.
""Listen, I've got to go.""
""Where?""
""Just... somewhere. I have things to do.""
""It's two in the morning. What the hell do you have to do?""
""Just... stuff. Where's my underwear?""
""Over there."" she points. I grab them and pull them on, checking myself out in the mirror as I do so. The light from her computer monitor makes me look more ripped than I am. I look for my shoes. When I find them, I don't bother to put them on, I carry them with me.
""I'll see you later, okay?""
""Call me?"" she asks.
""Yeah, you bet. Of course."" I respond, and walk out the door. I put my shoes on the hallway. I have no idea what her number is. I don't even remember her name. She is another cypher, an atomoton moving through the world as we all do, aimless, seeking purpose.

by William F. Denton

I will not bow to a titled knave,
Nor crouch to a lordly priest:
A martyr's torments I'd rather brave,
Than be of my manhood fleeced.

I'll bend my knee to no fancied god,
I'll fear no ghost so wan,
Erect and free I'll stand on the sod,
And act as becomes a man.

I'll pin my faith to no bigot's sleeve;
I'll swallow no griping creed;
I'll ask my Reason what to believe,
And ever her answer heed.

I'll hide no truth in a coward heart,
The world would be blest to know;
My boldest thought as it wills impart,
Nor check the mind's onward flow.

I'll love the true, I will do the right,
Ruled only by Reason's sway,
Let all do so; and the world's dark night
Will melt into rosy day."

"event","It is late. I walk around the back of the building to avoid the front desk, I don't want anyone to see me out of my room. In the backpack are the supplies I have carefully gathered over several weeks. I suspected it would come to this, and I was right. The final insult being too much, my hatred for her has overwhelmed me. It's one thing if she wants to mindfuck my friend, but when she tries that shit on me, she must be punished. I know where her room is, but I walk past it once, watching for onlookers. When I come back I stop at the door and knock. I wait. I knock again. After nearly a full minute, she answers.

""Look, we need to talk."" I say. She leans against the doorjam in a pair of shorts and a tank top. I think she was going to bed, maybe was asleep. It would be better for her if she were still groggy from sleep. ""Did I wake you up?""

""No."" she says, and this pleases me.

""Look, I'm sorry. I got a bit carried away, okay? Can we talk about this?"" She regards me for a moment before turning back into the room, leaving the door open. I enter, close and lock the door behind her. I walk into the suite, then her actual room. I'm lucky that her roommate moved out last semester. My hands go to the tire thumper tucked into the back of my pants, under my jacket, and the handcuffs in my pocket.

""What do you want to talk about?"" She hasn't even turned back around when I smash the tire thumper into the back of her head. She hits the ground on her side, stunned. I hit her again, for good measure, then roll her onto her stomach and, dropping the tire thumper, hand cuff her hands behind her. I then snatch the closest piece of clothing (a t-shirt) and stuff it into her mouth, forcing her jaw open and cramming it in. Then into the backpack for duct tape which I wrap around her head and use to secure the shirt in her mouth. This only takes a few seconds, but she is shaking off the blow and begins kicking, screaming into the t-shirt. I hit her with the tire thumper on the back, the arms, I think I break her forearm at one point, but her screaming continues. Finally I sit on her back and have to fight to bring her legs together to tie with nylon rope from the backpack. I wrap the rope around her ankles, feed it through the loop at the end and pull it tight, tie it back through itself and her legs are restrained. She is still trying to kick, though, pushing herself across the floor with her knees. I hit her again. She is still moving, still screaming, so I pull out the mace and give her a shot in the face. Even with the shirt in her mouth, it hits her hard, filling her eyes and nose, and she is finally silent. Her eyes are huge and watering, blinking, trying to force out the burning spray. When it seems that she's recovered I mace her again, just because.

Minutes later I am sitting naked in a chair. She is naked, too, after I've cut her clothes off with a pair of scissors. She's sobbing silently into the shirt. She probably thinks I'm going to rape her, but it's unlikely. She is skinny, but flabby, and my hatred of her is such that it is overwhelming any libido I might feel. I go to her closet, look inside, she has mostly plastic hanger, but I find one made out of wire. I take it, throw the blouse to the floor, and stretch it out, elongating it. She sees it coming and braces herself, but I pause long enough for her to open her eyes before I bring it down hard on her ass. She screams into the shirt, loudly enough that I'm afraid someone might hear, but there's no helping that. I hit her again, leaving another angry, satisfying, red welt. She is crying again as I flail her with the hanger, sometimes breaking the skin. My the time I am worn out her ass is a mess of destroyed flesh. Her tears have stained the carpet and her makeup has run. She is so ugly. I punch her in the face, then slap her with my cock. I spend the next several hours with her. Sometimes burning, cutting, beating her. Sometimes sitting and enjoying seeing her in this pathetic position. She is not mocking me now. Now she fears me.

By the very early morning she has fallen unconsious. I take pick her up and carry her to the bathroom, dropping her into the tub. The impact of her landing jars her awake and her eyes look up at me, pleading. I hold my dick, pissing on her, shake it off, then pick up the knife sitting on the back of the toilet. I let her see the knife, I allow her to be afraid again, then I bring it to her throat and pull it across in one complete motion. Blood spurts out and runs down her chest, her gurgling the only noise in the otherwise silent bathroom. I watch, waiting, seeing how long it takes her to die. It takes longer than I thought it would for her to stop twitching, even longer for her to stop breathing. For the first time I become worried. If this takes too long, I'll have to wait until tomorrow night to finish the job and that's a risk I don't want to take. When she is finally done I turn the shower on and let the hot water rush over her body, rinsing the blood off and sending it swirling down the drain. After a minute of that, I rip down the shower curtain and wrap her in it as best as I can. She is heavier than I thought, but I wrestle her back into the room and throw her onto the bed. There, I wrap her and the shower curtain in the bedspread. Under the bed I find a large plastic bin I knew was there. I stuff her into it, actually heving to bash her head to the side with the tire thumper to make her fit. With this, I dress and prepare to move. Checking the doors, I ensure that no one is coming before I drag the bin outside, again looking around, then to the dumpster. It takes nearly all of my strength, time in the gym not withstanding, to lift the bin up and over the rim of the dumpster.

Her body lands in the garbage with a satisfying 'thud'. I walk away, not toward the building, but toward my car. I sit in it, listening to the radio. Chris Isaak's song <I>Wicked Games</I>, a personal favorite, is playing when the truck comes to empty the dumpster. I can't see the bin when it's dumped in the back, but when the press hits I am comforted, knowing that the results of my crime are being pressed into a small cube with the refuse of four hundred undergraduates.

I am avenged."

"event","Steve Schalchlin is a singer/songwriter who has released one album and collaborated with his partner, Jim Brochu on the Stage Musical <I>The Last Session</I>. He is living with AIDS, a consistent theme in much of his music, but not in a preachy, pop-culture way. I've seen <I>The Last Session</I> and purchased the soundtrack to the New York cast (although there is talk of a recording of the Indianapolis cast which i will have to buy) as well as his album called ""The Bonus Round Sessions"". I've listened to both and have to admit that while the songs sound better in his voice, I think his best work are the songs that were included in the show.

My favorite is, without a doubt, ""Connected"". In it he describes his first experiences with AIDS-related illness. The memorable line of the song is, ""We should all be connected to each other."" The melody is a work of genius, and the way Steve write lyrics is unbelieveable. He manages to work without tight format, his songs often don't rhyme or even have consistent metre, but while this would usually bother me, I find it brilliant the way Steve uses his consistently clever and witty lyrics to tell a story in most of his songs. Some of the most memorable are in the song ""William's Song"": 

<I>William was a boy in Arkansas
A little bit different
In redneck country
this was not very cool

So they called him a fag
And they called him a queer
They then jumped him on
the sidewalk after school
  

Tell me why does it take
five great big guys
To beat up one little queer
What do they fear? What do they fear?</I>


Admittidly, my favorite song, ""Connected"", follows a pretty strict and standard format, although Steve's piano work is unequaled, and his vocal talent is among the best I've ever heard.

I met Steve once, he came to the University to talk to us and push <I>The Last Session</I> when it was playing at Theatre on the Square, where I later saw it. I was very aware that I was in the room with a man with AIDS and made sure to shake his hand and hug him afterward because, not only did I feel like it on general priciples, but partly because I felt a bit guilty.

The only critique I have about the show is regarding the set. Steve has one eye that tends to wander and the way the set was arranged that eye was downstage most of the time. It made it hard to tell where he was looking much of the time, and I imagine it wasn't addressed because no one was quite sure how to tactfully mention it.

The show, however, is brilliant despite being a bit derivative, but is partly based on Steve's life, so it's entirely forgiveable, even commendable. The music is pefect to carry the mood and the contrast of the humor of the characters versus the tragedy of the songs is perfectly crafted. I wouldn't be surprised to see <I>The Last Session</I> win a number of awards this year (perhaps a Tony if it makes it onto Broadway, which is entriely possible), and if Steve Schalchlin isn't at least nominated for a Grammy in the next five years I will be sorely dissappointed."

"event","...he walked into the dark suite, silently remarked at how bare it looked, especially in the dark, and set the fresh flowers down on the counter. He knew that his roommates, Juston and Ryan, wouldn't be there, they had left earlier, with Kristin (Juston's current obsession) Ashley (Ryan's current girlfriend) and Josh (the closet homosexual). The had gone to Champs... He thought. He opened His room, turned on the light. What a pit. Josh had no doubt been sitting in His chair. There was a half-empty box of donuts and an open bag of Barbecue chips beside it. Normally this wouldn't irritate Him. He looked at His computer, the error message on the screen said ""That is not the correct password.""
   Someone had been trying to guess his screen saver password. Probably Josh, the computer 'expert'.
   He took His coat, scarf, shoes, shirt, off. No sooner had He slipped into a dirty but comfortable tank-top undershirt than Bobby burst in, with out knocking. He could right away tell that Bobby was drunk, He couldn't remember ever seeing Bobby sober.
   ""Where's the big man, Juston?"" Bobby asked.
   ""He left."" He responded simply.
   ""Oh.""
   There was a long pause. Bobby turned to leave, then turned back, remembering something.
   ""What is Juston's screen name?""
   ""go2juston."" He responded, flatly.
   ""Oh... just 'g', 'o', and the number '2'?""
   ""Yeah."" He replied, ""but remember Juston is spelled with an 'o', instead of an 'i'.""
   ""Oh, it is?""
   ""Yeah.""
   ""Like, just-on?""
   ""Yeah. Just-on."" He replied, mimicing Bobby's articulation.
   ""Right on."" Bobby stood. ""All right, I'll see you later.""
   ""Later, man."" he replied.
   Bobby left.
   He walked out into the suite, saw that His coffee maker was turned on. There was no coffee in the carafe. The residue had been baked into a hard crust at the bottom. This pissed Him off, but He was in no mood to acknowledge it. He began to pull the trash can out from under the sink, then thought better of it, cut the flowers over the sink, and placed them in a Pat O'Brien's hurricane glass He had purchased at a thrift store some time ago for twenty-five cents. He considered putting on an album, but then changed His mind and went back into His room.
   He was alone, but not lonely. He sat at his computer, entered the correct password and...

The Indianapolis Star crossword was difficult today, He had guessed at a few words, putting whatever looked right and fit. It angered Him that He had to guess."

"event","Juston is pissing me off. I've been truly single since freshman year. Despite having 'broken up' with Jackie, they still act like they're together. But even so, he has laid claim to every woman we know who I might be the least bi interested in. Kristin, Tarin, Laura, Mary (although I fucking hate Mary), Jackie (though I hate Jackie, too), Francis (hate Francis), Jaime (though Jaime is a self-centered, skanky, cunt and I want no part of her) Dee (who he fucked and then tried to pretend that she took advantage of him, I know better. I know it's a long shot that anything will happen between Dee and I, but still, she wants me to help her hook up with him, but he says that she's a slut and he's right) even this girl who works the desk sometimes and I noticed and made eyes at her for awhile, he asked her out, I didn't even get a chance (got rejected, hah you fucking loser. he stayed in bed for a day and a half after that. What a fucking pussy. Welcome to my world.), I can never tell who he's really into or not. I was trying to maybe work something with Tarin and feel her out and no sooner do I begin expressing any interest in her (and she begins expressing an interest in me, offering to take tequila shots off of my cock, she was drunk at the time) than he asks her out, too, then cancels. I swear to Bog it's like he's trying to fucking cut me out of any chance to even get laid, much less have a real relationship.

He has 'laid a claim' to every girl we know with a few exceptions: Abbey (I had her first and I really do think I love her. I swear to bog I will kill him if he tries to ruin what I have with her), some of the chicks in the department (the ones he hasn't met yet), and his sister. Every other girl we know he has sworn his heart to at one time or another, making <I>me</I> the asshole if I even try anything with any of them.

What the fuck? He has women hanging on him. I get it for fucking christ sake! I've heard from a million women a million times how fucking hot my roommate is. The next bitch that says shit about him I'll fucking bust her lip.

I'm so sick and tired of being the fat little sidekick, the Rob Schneider of this partnership. Now David is talking about he and Dan moving in with us again. Fuck that. Those guys are assholes I hate them, and the last thing I need is two more good looking guys to move in around here. I won't even be able to score 'sidekick' I'll be demoted to Quasimodo.

I'm losing weight, I'm getting in shape, I cut my hair, I dress well, I'm well spoken, I'm informed and educated. WHAT THE FUCK DO THESE FUCKING CUNTS WANT? FOR CHRIST SAKE. I fucking hate these sluts, all of them waiting to slob his fucking cock because his abs poke through his skinny ass skin. He was a fucking virgin when he started and has still only fucked a total of two women, that I know of (and he would tell me if he did the loser) and the second he now claims was akin to rape. So fuck him, what the fuck does he know about women? but they flock to him like he shits diamonds or something. My whole life I've been the nerd, the dork, the wierdo, the freak and I am sick and tired of it. When does this dog get his day? If they won't give me my day <I>I will take it</I>. ""You only get what you're willing to take"" write that down, roll it real tight, and shove it up your pompus skinny ass, fucker. Well, fine. I have had enough of being judged. I have had enough of sneers and condescending looks. I hate you all and I will someday own <U>you</U>.

His girlfriend, Jackie. He still thinks they're going to get back together and someday get married, but she is such a bitch, she tries to play head games with him, she refuses to settle for anything less than what she wants and if she doesn't get it she whines and bitches until she does. I swear to bog, one more fucking time she calls me and wants me to wake him up HOW FUCKING STUPID ARE YOU? i DIDN'T WAKE HIM UP LAST TIME, I DIDN'T WAKE HIM UP THE TIME BEFORE THAT, OR THE ONE BEFORE THAT, OR BEFORE THAT, OR BEFORE THAT, AD INFINITUM, WHAT THE FUCK MAKES YOU THINK I WILL THIS TIME YOU FUCKING CUNT WHORE BITCH. YOU'VE BEEN CHEATING ON HIM FROM THE START SUCKING SOME OTHER GUYS COCKS AND NOW YOU ACT LIKE YOUR PROBLEMS ARE HIS FAULT OR MY FAULT LIKE I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU BEING A TOTAL CUNT! FUCK YOU FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING BURN IN HELL YOU FUCKING SPLI-TAIL CUNT WHORE!


I overheard the following conversation in the cafeteria today and it inspired such loathing in me that I nearly vomited all over the table:

Boy: I think we should stop this.
Girl: Stop this? What?
Boy: Maybe.
Girl: Stop it? Yeah.
Boy: Maybe, I don't know.
Girl: Was it because of Europe?
Boy: No. I just don't know why.
Girl: You should stop smoking.
Boy: Why don't you stop... stop...
Girl: You're right. It's not working.
Boy: I don't know. You're really... You <I>are</I> pretty.
Girl: You <I>are</I> too.
Boy: The meek shall inherit the earth.
Girl: The meek don't want it.
Boy: I like the new Coldplay song.
Girl: It's the drugs, isn't it?
Boy: Do you want to go back to my room?
Girl: What Coldplay song?
Boy: Was it because of who I slept with?
Girl: No. Yes. No.
Boy: The meek don't want it? What?"

"event","The Indianapolis Star crossword was disappointing today. I completed it in only forty-five minutes, and there were none of those periods where I sit and stare at the page, drooling, for minutes at a time, trying to remember a word for 'ceramic' that only has four letters. 

I was sitting outside the cafeteria, doing nothing and forgetting most of my responsibilities, but reading <I>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</I> and flirting with several of the cast members, when this Indian girl named 'Manu' who worked in the cafeteria and whom I have been blatently flirting with for two years now, but whom I haven't seen in awhile, walks up and we start talking. She quit the cafeteria, but might come back, she's not sure; the clothes she's wearing are pretty shapeless and it's hard to see her body, but I saw her in an evening dress one time ages ago and she dropped my jaw, so I know what's there. Meanwhile, I realize she's checking <I>me</I> out, which is understandable because I'm wearing a skin-tight black polyester t-shirt that shows off all of my torso muscles that I've <I>honed</I> and <I>sculpted</I> (but are now covered by a layer of winter fat that I simply <I>must</I> work off, but don't matter now, because I'm flexing for her benfit) and it gives me a great sense of pleasure to watch this chick this <I>hardbody</I> that I've lusted after for so long <I>wanting me</I>. But for some reason, better judgement, shyness, pink unicorn knows why I don't ask her out, still, opting instead to be cool and aloof, and I can tell that she's waiting for me to say something, but instead I just listen to her and ask questions, making <I>her</I> do all the talking and I learn that she is twenty-five as of January and has recently become cynical and, rather than trying to change the world, has decided to do what makes <I>her</I> happy, so, although she has completed her International Relations degree, she's now decided that she <I>doesn't</I> want to change the world after all, but instead wants to be a business major and make <I>herself</I> happy, but it will be hell telling all of this to her mother who, as Manu puts it ""If you could sell guilt trips she would be the richest travel agent in the world."" This isn't funny, but I laugh as if it were, showing lots of teeth and actually throwing me head back, because I want her to think I find her interesting, and I do, really, but not terribly and this is dissappointing to me because I had gotten my hopes up that she might be <I>different</I> than all the other self-righteous people I know but she goes on about how much she hates politics now that she has gained her cynicism saying, ""To be a successful politician you have to be an unsuccessful human being"" and ""It's hard to lie to other people, but it's easy to lie to yourself."" and she tells me about how she has tried to make everyone else happy (although she never explains who 'everyone else' really is) and she is desperately trying to figure out who she is.

And this is all very disappointing to me because I had worked up and <I>image</I> of her in my mind, in my imagination and in this <I>image</I> she was a pragmatic person who traveled from wherever-the-fuck-she-is-from to come here and we would meet and connect in out mutual nihilism, but, in fact, all I'm hearing is that she's just like every angst-ridden teenager in every John Hughes film from the eighties I can remember, and the fact that she is coming to these realization at <I>twenty-five</I> speaks very poorly of her emotional development as a human being, and she's searching for meaning in life, feeling like the world is against her, that she must find purpose and motivation, and she has yet to make the leap to the truly mature and enlightened understanding that the universe and the world don't have purpose, they simply <I>are</I> and out lives have no purpose but that which we give them.

And during all of this I agree with her, nodding like one of those water-drinking birds, occassionally commenting, but letter her guide the brief conversation. Then she says that her ride is there (I gather she doesn't own a car... can foreigners own cars if they're not citizens?) and she must go. I bid her farewell and make sure that she understands by my blase attitude that although I enjoyed her intrusion it really has not <I>made my night</I> but I still find her gorgeous although I could never tell her that.

She leaves."

"event","<lj-cut text=""I was recommended 30 Seconds to Mars by a 62 year old woman yesterday at work."">One of the most amazing things happened to me yesterday at work and I wanted to document it before I&nbsp;forgot about the whole ordeal. <br /><br />I was approached by a 62 year old woman wearing what appeared to be an old school type of mafia looking hat, a yellow puffy jacket with a fleecey collar, and a blue scarf, with what seemed like men's faded type jeans. You could tell her teeth were dentures because when she talked they moved ever so slightly out of her mouth and they were trimmed in her dark brown lipstick. She also had straggly blonde hair that was almost to the end of her neck.<br /><br />She came over to me while I was doing the denim and started talking about how she had gotten a pap smear and that she might have cervical cancer. She was talking about how she might have skin cancer and that that would be genetic, but she wasn't sure if cervical cancer was. She was saying how she would want her family to be there to support her and the thing she's most afraid of is the needle. Then she asked me if I&nbsp;knew Jared Leto and 30 Seconds to Mars. I&nbsp;told her I did and she fell backward in shock and put her hand on her chest and said I&nbsp;love that band. She said her daughter said all she wanted to do was dance and junk, but she loves music. She asked me if I&nbsp;ever saw &quot;A Beautiful Lie&quot;&nbsp; and she started singing it. I&nbsp;said no and she stared describing the video to me and how it was about the polar ice caps and how much the snow has melted since that video. She was telling me about some association around the world that studies these things.<br /><br />I helped her find a sweater and she went to the fitting room, but before that she asked me what my first name was like 5 times. I think she said her name was Patty. <br /><br />After she was done in the fitting room, she asked me how old I&nbsp;was and said I&nbsp;had so much &quot;spirit&quot;. She said her daughter was 26 and that she wanted to make me smile. She told me a joke that she said she remembered from &quot;In Living Color&quot;&nbsp;which was:&nbsp;&quot;Why does aspirin have a job?&nbsp;So it can work for you!&quot;&nbsp;But I&nbsp;didn't laugh. After that she told me about how 30 Seconds to Mars was coming to Philadelphia and that I&nbsp;should see them, she said I could be so close to Jared, or some shit. <br /><br />I just looked up the video. That encounter actually makes me want to go see them, even though I&nbsp;only truly appreciated the first album they had. <br /><br />Here's the video:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kvd-uquuhI<br />It's actually a pretty good song.</lj-cut>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: larger;""><lj-cut text=""It's Not Gonna Work That Way"">I don't know why I&nbsp;bother randomly attempting to socialize...it does nothing for me and I'm not even sure why I try it when the outcome simply ends up in a headache. I guess Aaron was my guinea pig for today. A part of me for some reason just has this urge to try to connect with people, even though I&nbsp;know no one will. All of the people I&nbsp;have ever found are damaged like me and that's really the only thing we hold in common. Everyone is so different than me and the saying 'opposites attract' is sorta bullshit. I mean, I&nbsp;guess I&nbsp;would've have had that many friends that were so different if that saying were false, but simultaneous it discourages me deeply when nothing I can do or say will hold any weight.<br /><br />The ignorance in my area is so great that sometimes I&nbsp;don't know how to control myself. I don't know if this'll end up making me seem like some sort of music snob&nbsp;(because I don't really think I am one at all), but one of the only things I have a sort of passion for talking about is music. And it's hard for me to try to come up with things to talk about with other people that I&nbsp;work with when all they know is Rap and R&amp;B. I love my share of these genres, but there is so much more to them. Today I tried to talk to that kid about Horrorcore, Rapcore, and Nu-metal...which are just a few of the many sub-genres that Rap has. I'm not sure why I even bothered trying to expand his vocabulary when I know things like this are just idle chit-chat. These things I&nbsp;have to say, these things I&nbsp;want to use to express myself, they hold no weight whatsoever. It gets to the point where I just want to hurt something.<br /><br />I used to lash out, but I'm trying harder to hold it in now, I guess. I just feel like there is so much to the world and no one knows what any of it is. I'm not trying to have some hardcore teenage angst shit here, but this is how small minded Philadelphia seems to be. This is my city and I've found a few people to communicate with, but deep inside my misanthropy takes hold of me and even my closest friends become my biggest enemies.<br /><br />I just can't stand myself sometimes. I&nbsp;don't even know if any of this makes sense, because I feel like nothing I could type out could do how I feel justice. I don't expect everyone to have all of the same interests as me, but to at least know the world. Why do I&nbsp;care? That's the biggest issue I'm having. Why does it feel like I&nbsp;have to miss anything when there was nothing there to begin with? I&nbsp;have a boyfriend and he's more than enough for me, but sometimes it's like...I&nbsp;just want someone elses opinion, someone elses company. But majority of the time when I get that company, I&nbsp;don't want it anymore. It's like my hatred seethes out slowly. And while we're sitting or standing around talking and everything I say goes through one ear and out the other, I just get a headache.<br /><br />I can't stand people anymore. I&nbsp;can't stand myself when I feel this way. I&nbsp;just wish I wasn't so full of anger right now.<br />I would've been completely fine with the ignorance and the incoherence, but then Aaron decided to scare me at work.<br />Everyone at work somehow finds it hilarious to scare me while I'm ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING SHIT.<br />All day Aaron just fucking...made it look like he was doing shit. And I mean, I guess just walking around the store and contributing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is good for him since he doesn't have to do shit, but for people who're actually doing their job it's really aggravating. He was supposed to be the one doing the Women's Denim today, but instead I was called forth to help, and instead of getting the work done, he just climbs up a ladder a few times, goes into the fitting room, grabs an electronic cat light thing, and just meows which shining it in my face. And I guess after being alone for so long doing the denim it was a relief to have someone around who doesn't take anything seriously, it really did cheer me up...Usually I'm so depressed there. But then I began to notice that all the work was getting done a lot faster when I didn't pay attention to him or laugh at him meowing. When I kept myself busy time went by so much faster and he just is all &quot;I'm so bored&quot;.....What the fuck.<br /><br />I'm not trying to make it out like I'm employee of the month, but I&nbsp;actually do what I'm supposed to do, and it's a miracle people like him even keep jobs. I&nbsp;just felt so spiteful that I was doing the denim still and he was just hanging out in the fitting room talking to girls...and then decides it's a good idea to sneak up on me while I'm completely focused on what I'm doing.<br /><br />I just need to cool myself off and wanted to vent somehow. I guess it's time for Steve Wilkos.</lj-cut><br /></span>"

"event","<p><lj-cut text=""Some stupid shit, click to read, if you want to."">Okay, so I removed all the japanese font from the journal. Not like it matters, since no one comments or cares, but I figured it'd be easier to just put simple english instead of stupid metaphors in another language.<br /><br />I'm downstairs because I got depressed because of how Michael was acting. I called him and asked him what he was doing and he refused to answer me until I&nbsp;told him what I was doing instead. The way that he acts is so unnecessary. I wanted to play a game with him because no one else was online and I added him to an xbox party because that's what I&nbsp;do when I talk to people and he was squibbling at me about talking to him online, he said it was stupid to play together and not talk. I&nbsp;put on the headset and when I added him to the party he yelled at me again about how we could just talk through the game thing, I&nbsp;don't really understand what the big deal was considering the only person he was playing with was me, and it caused us to both die in the game, and he messages me saying leave the party, and when I do he leaves the game. I invited him again and we played and didn't say anything to each other. Finally he goes &quot;Did you know you can hit diagonally?&quot; I said &quot;No, thanks for letting me know.&quot; and that was like the extent of the conversation so I'm not really sure why it was absolutely necessary for me to have the headset on or for me to leave the party I&nbsp;made just to join a team speak when all you say is bullshit. <br /><br />He made me all depressed for some reason. I bought Castlevania because I wanted to play with him and because he so badly wanted me to get it, for some reason. So I&nbsp;got it to make him happy, because honestly it didn't look like a game I would really want to play. I started playing with him once I got it and he was so excited. But unbeknown to me, he had already been playing the game nonstop since he bought it and apparently had like every item in the game and all of his characters maxed out. I tried playing with him and he just says shit like &quot;It's like you've never played a Castlevania game before.&quot;&nbsp;It was like the third stage of the game and my character had no gear or anything and he's saying this shit to me. He acts like the game is a life or death situation and if he dies once he flips out and leaves party.<br /><br />He hasn't been playing the Castlevania games so he just does research on reviews of games and shit and that's how he gets to know the characters and shit. It's retarded. He makes me hate one of my favorite games ever because he's...I don't even know what it's called. What is someone who has to have max of everything in a game?&nbsp;A&nbsp;perfectionist? He specifically called me up just to tell me about how someone on xbox sent him a voicemail telling him how GREAT he was at the game...what the fuck?&nbsp;What does it matter? I bought it just to play it with him because I&nbsp;enjoy spending time with him and talking to him and interacting with him, but when I&nbsp;play with him he just says I'm shitty and acts all crazy.<br /><br />I can't stand it. He belittles all the other Castlevania games and he hasn't even played them before. He holds Symphony of the Night in such high regards that it makes me sick and hate it...when I&nbsp;shouldn't, because I&nbsp;love that game and out of all the games I've ever played, that game is one of the very few that I&nbsp;can almost always play it over and over.<br /><br />I don't know. I'm not really sure why I got so depressed. I told him that I felt depressed and I didn't really feel like playing anymore, I guess it was because of how he had already been acting, but it was also because he has to be good at every character in the new game. You can play as a bunch of different characters in the game. I chose Jonathan because he has subweapons and a whip and just seemed like my favorite. He kept playing as Soma, I guess I thought it was because he liked that character, but apparently the only reason why he was playing that character so much was because he wanted to level him to the max and get all of his items. So when we played he started playing as Jonathan and was like, what it seemed to be, showing me off. <br /><br />He kept saying about how all of his moves that aren't used do tons of damage and since no body uses them that's why they think he's shitty...Like he went through some sort of revelation or something. And just like before he starts off the game killing everything before me and running a head because he has these super fast boots on that are a really rare drop and that he got simply because he played the shit out of one level a million times to get it. I don't know about you, but playing the same stage in a game a million times doesn't sound like fun to me. And since he's sat around doing that constantly, all of his characters are just all really ridiculously strong and shit, which makes playing the game with him kind of not fun anymore.<br /><br />I don't know. But, yea, after I told him I didn't wanna play he got all crazy and was like &quot;What'd you mean depressed?&nbsp;What?&quot;&nbsp;and I was like &quot;Talk to you later&quot; and he goes &quot;WHATEVER&quot; and leaves the party and that's that. <br /><br />I'm not really sure how he keeps his friends with the way he acts, or why I want to continue being his friend. I guess I&nbsp;should've gotten used to him acting this way a real long time ago. But since apparently he's CHANGED SO MUCH, I&nbsp;figured he'd be less of a pain. Him with his one pair of 'kind of' skinny jeans and his 'fo-hawk'....what the fuck.<br /><br />Well, whatever. Just wanted to vent myself....to...myself.</lj-cut></p>"

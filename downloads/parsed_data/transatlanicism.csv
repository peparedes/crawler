"event","<p>i'm very sick. and it won't go away. as graphic as this sounds, i have to wake up every morning and cough up about ten loogies of flem. but it feels like my throat is bleeding because its so sore. i also believe im dehydrated. which doesn't help. every so often, i'll become hungry, really hungry, SUPER HUNGRY. and if i don't eat i just feel nauseous. my sister vomited all night yesterday and so yeah. i think a lot of healing is in order.<br /><br />now, enough of that. how is everyone? i'm listening to city and colour, and my head is clear. which is a very nice feeling. early this week, after playworks ended, i made myself a list of stressful things i had to deal with. it looked like this:<br /><u>MADISON'S LIST OF STRESSFUL SHIT</u><br />- Get Well<br />- Finish My French Project<br />- DEAL WITH MY SOCIAL CLASS<br />- Get my CALM Modules.<br />- Make More Money<br /><br />now, after a week, my list look more like this:<br /><br /><u>MADISON'S LIST OF STRESSFUL SHIT<br /></u>- Get Well<br /><strike>- Finish My French Project<br />- DEAL WITH MY SOCIAL CLASS<br />- Get my CALM Modules.</strike><br />- Make More Money<br /><br />So as you can see, i haven't been doing too badly. i'm finally out of my social class and i am doing CALM every day till the end of the year. I plan to get it done today or tomorrow. just so i can get a move on with it. mmm i just ate a delicious cookie. yum yum. that reminds me. i ding'd to level 28 on my preist and i'm stoked to get to 29 and rock some warsong action. i'm pretty stoked. <br /><br />now, to make a new list all together. i shall call this one...<br /><u>MADISON'S LIST OF GOALS (LONG AND SHORT TERM)</u><br />- Get Fit (LONGTERM)<br />- Go to the gym more (Short Term)<br />- Longboard more and pwn the boys with my skills (...we'll see)<br />- Marry Ben Gibbard (.........)<br /><br />That looks great! now, i'm going to go read some perez hilton, and some news. Oh! also, before I go, saturday + sunday I'm going to calgary with my bff heather for my birthday. wooo.<br /><br />lovelovelove<br />madison</p>"

not much&nbsp;has changed from my last&nbsp;entry. which is rather displeasing i guess. i'll try to stay positive.

the weather is beautiful. i couldn't be happier. i love the sun and i just got a brand new pair of sunglasses and i love them. all i need now is my car (which i do not want to talk about) and&nbsp;a haircut and i'll be good to go.

school is better i guess. well, friday i only went&nbsp;to 2 classes and it was great. it was also heather's party which was a blast. agggh... my hand just gave out. so i guess one handed typing for me. owwie.&nbsp;i also went&nbsp;shopping&nbsp;with my mother&nbsp;which is&nbsp;always fun and my dad is a year older.

i think that my&nbsp;biggest boy issue at eh moment is that i&nbsp;desperately want to seperate myself from them. or at least one in peticular. just for a while to see how i do.

i'm&nbsp;very&nbsp;sleepy. im going to take a power nap and go grocery shopping.

good day.&nbsp;"

"event","last night, i became one of the guys.&nbsp;

sam michael and i had a lot of fun trying to play gears of war and listening to the dropkick murphys. it was wonderful.

before that i had a wonderful day with sam and rebecca. we honestly wandered around downtown for hours, taking pictures of beautiful street art and attempting to do some ourselves. sam decided to write ""kill all your friends and ride thier corpses like a carousel"" on a door. he only wrote about half before we thought someone was coming. we are not ninjas... but it was for the sake of art.&nbsp;

we tried to climb up on top of buildings but failed miserably. honestly, people make it hard for kids to spread good art in this town. i wish there were designated places for kids to share thier words in the form of art. i think it would be wonderful. natalie and i have agreed to do some sort of street art project together. i am hoping with my next coupld of cheques to put away a lot for new york and the rest for new paint and canvas. i want to do art, bitch.

the gallery show i'm in goes up in 6 days and i've never been so excited. i hope that all four of the photos i submitted will be up. and today i am hoping, if i ever get off this blasted computer to go out and start taking more photos. i absolutly love the fact that it's starting to become warm again. last night was freezing, walking around with no coat was dumb. but i'm over it now.

the song i am listening to (colin hay - i just don't think i'll ever get over you) makes me want to cry. the last time i wrote about that song was when i was head over heels for a boy. now i am far from that, but the song still gives me a really warm feeling in my stomach. i just need to be better at this.&nbsp;

well i'm going out to take some photos. right now i am very sore and starting to get butterflies. but i need to go out and take some photos.

love

"event","hello friends of cyber space,

there is no need to apoligize for my absence due to the fact that it's going to happen. I should've warned you.
It has been months since my last entry and i really shouold updat everyone about what has been happening. I think it would benefit you in the future.

-I broke up with Roger.&nbsp;
-I am in high school and slowly suffocating
-i bought an extravagant camera, canon digital rebel xti, for an extravagant price, $2000
-my music taste has&nbsp;expanded disgustingly (while still being tried and true to former bands)
-i am into radio

that's all i can really think of that should be much of a difference. i might mention some things you won't understnad, then i might just have to explain them.&nbsp;

my major interests at the time include radio, acting, and photography. but if anything this will also change as well.

So now, let's go back to today:

today is a beautiful day. yesterday was beautiful as well. but today is excenptionally beautiful and i think that will add to the day i want to have today. i am hopefully going to meet a dear friend to bake cookies, but first i am going to visit a friend, shawn, at our workplace.

i think i should go and spend not so much time on here. i have a good day's worth of stuff to do.

love

"event","today is the second day after one of the best days of my life, in the so far best year of my life, in the best summer i have ever had. i like opening my mind, a lot more happens. before anyone thinks 'opening my mind' means doing something illegal or becoming a lesbian, you are all wrong. unless being in love counts as a drug. oh gosh that was cheesy. which ever...<br />so two days ago was slayer, roger's favourite band. so as a present i scored him, chris, and I tickets to go see them. (at a sold out show) and so I&nbsp;met roger in the morning at the train station in which we would embark on our quest to Chris' house to pick him up. we hear the beeping that the train is coming... then a wierd noise. A lot of honking and then a crash. we both swung our heads to see that the train had hit a car. it was&nbsp;quite funny. i adminisedered quite the group of lolz.&nbsp;as&nbsp;did roger, and everyone else. It was very funny.&nbsp;fifteen minutes after, we&nbsp;got on a&nbsp;train to go to clareview and off to chris' house! we picked him up... not much excitment there,&nbsp;then we were&nbsp;on our way!&nbsp;On our way to the shaw we were confirmed about&nbsp;our&nbsp;tickets and roger&nbsp;screamed ""WE ARE GOING TO SLAYER""&nbsp;in the train car, startling everyone. &nbsp;it was very nice to see him and chris soo happy. finally we make it to the show (meeting a cool hippie along the way) and line up.&nbsp; We finally get in and grab some seats, through the first two bands before roger and chris go to mosh. roger loses chris, and we don't find him till the band&nbsp;was over, and his pants ripped. so he was sad. but do not fret! we still had an awesome time at the rest of the show. 'cept... i slipped on beer and fell, got trampled on by a drunk guy, and got a beer cup thrown at my head. ahaha. great times. ^_^ so then after the show, with the two mezmerised boys tagging along. i was anxious to get home. Roger and Chris were spending the night becuase it was more convienient and well.. i wanted to spend more time with them.&nbsp; We got home, i put on eurotrip and chris fell asleep about half way through. so roger and I watched the rest of the movie.. sort of. We put on donnie darko. although we were paying too much to each other than the movie. he pinned me down and tickled my feet. he is so adorable. i won't go into too much detail. i finally went to bed at 5:30am and woke up 3 hours later to go wake him up so he could go to work.<br /><br />it was an amazing end, to an amazing day<br />and there will be many like them to come.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img0.img.nexopia.com/images/smilies/blush.gif"" /><br /><br />keep all your bodies warm, and your hearts bright<br />xoxo<br />maddy"

<P>I havn't posted in a long time becuase I've been super busy doing all this stupid school related stuff and also Christmas is fast approaching... Which means <STRONG>WORK!</STRONG> Which is alright, I love my job.. but it really cuts back on my leisure time. I hae also been thinking about my new years resolutions and they arn't coming to me in a fit, that's all I have to say on that. </P>"

<P>I am here Micheal. Don't be alone!</P>

<P>So, Micheal is a pretty cool dude. And we are RPing and it is one of my dreams to do what they are right now. Sitting on a&nbsp;beach, she has a camera in hand, and they are talking. God. I want that to happen to me SO badly. God. I'm hopeless.</P>
<P>I am exhausted. I just rocked ass at my script with Kali and we got pretty far. 10 scenes. Woo. -sad-</P>
<P>I want Micheal to go online, and I want to go lie on my bed. I think I might go do that.</P>
<P>Later everyone.</P>

"event","<P>Well, I just wrote a huge entry and then when I clicked the wrong link, IT ERASED IT. </P>
<P>Start Over:</P>
<P>So.</P>
<P>My name is Madison. I am fourteen and work&nbsp;at the Marble Slab creamery on Jasper and 109th.&nbsp;I wear glasses with no lenses, as retarded as it sounds. I believe in optimism, true love, and the Vanilla smells REALLY good. That's the way to win into my heart. Vanilla anything. That, and raspberry. I love Music, music, music, music. Death Cab, The Shins, The Cure. All way up there. I like a bit of everything when it comes to music. Except country. Blech. Zach braff is my idol, and garden state is the best movie ever made. Gerber dasies are my favorite flower and I (L) andy worhol. Hubba Hubba/</P>
<P>ok. shutting up.</P>
<P>I have triumphantly returned to Live journal becuase a friend of mine (<lj user=""chronomaru"" /> ) had an account. I usually switch very easily from host to host. But I have returned. And I actually like this better.</P>
<P>Well, how to sum up today, my parents and siblings feuding, I hand thanksgiving dinner, went to work, sore wrists. That's about it.</P>
<P>I am RPing with my friend Micheal right now. It is sweet fun. I love this kid. I am going to buy him a birthday present. :)</P>
<P>Well, I shall write when I am in Video tomorrow. Becuase, what the hell else am I supposed to do?</P>"

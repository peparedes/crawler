"event","<center/>Close your eyes... And go back...

Before the Internet or the AIM

Before semi automatics and weed

Before playstation2 or X-bOX

Before the 5 hours of homework you put off every night...

*Before when We got Our Hearts Broken*


Way back...


I'm talkin' bout hide and go seek at dusk.

Red light, Green light.

Playing kickball & dodgeball until your porch light came on.

Mother May I?

Red Rover

four square

Hula Hoops

Running through the sprinkler

Happy Meals

Getting the privelage to sit in the front seat of the car


Wait...

Watchin' Saturday Morning cartoons

Like Hey Arnold and Doug

Or what about legends of the hidden temple, global guts, double dare,
and
who, ARE YOU AFFRAID OF THE DARK!

Who could forget Snick

Or the teenage mutant ninja turtles,and Power Rangers,


Christmas morning...

Your first day of school

Bedtime Prayers and Goodnight Kisses


Climbing trees

Getting an ice cream off the ice cream truck

A million mosquito bites and sticky fingers

Jumpin' down the steps

Jumpin' on the bed

Pillow fights

Runnin' till you were out of breath

Laughing so hard that your stomach hurt and you almost peed your pants

Being tired from playin' all day

Your first crush...

Rainy days at school meant playing ""Heads up 7-Up"" in the classroom

Remember that?


I'm not finished yet...

Kool-Aid was the drink of the summer

Giving your friends a ride on your handlebars or spokes

Wearing your new shoes on the first day of school

Class Field Trips

When nearly everyone's mom was at home when the kids got there.

When getting high was swinging on the swingset

When $5 seemed like a million, and another dollar a Miracle.

When your parents took you to McDonalds and you were so cool.

When Toys r Us overuled the ""mall""


I want to go back to the time when...

Decisions were made by going ""eeny-meeny-miney-moe""

Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, ""do over!""

""Race issue"" meant arguing about who ran the fastest.

Money issues were handled by whoever was the banker in ""monopoly""

Catching fireflies could happily occupy an entire evening

It wasn't odd to have two or three ""best"" friends.

Being old, referred to anyone over 20.

The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was cooties.

Nobody was prettier than Mom

Nobody was cooler than Dad

Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better

It was a big deal to finally be tall enough to ride the ""big people""
rides
at the amusement park.

Getting an inch of snow was a dream come true.

Abilities were discovered because of a ""double-dog-dare""

Spinning around, getting dizzy and falling down was cause for giggles.


If you can remember most or all of these, then you have LIVED!!!<center/>"

"event","Made the drive back from the Ville yesterday. I ended staying another day since I found out that I didn't have to work last night. Had to buy a shirt from Sports Authority to compensate for lack of clothing. On the way home, an older male of the white persuasion in a bright yellow VW beatle kept playing games on the I75. He kept doing circles around my car. And everytime he would pull up right next to me, he would stare at me the entire time. Came home and did the necessary cleaning. Nothing else to do, so did the necessary studying. At one point or another, I got really lonely and sad. I didn't even want to go to the fireworks. I miss her so much. It's crazy sometimes. Jeremy wanted to study so I went over there around 11. Stayed over there for a few hours. He's interested in my relationship with Yogi. Keeps asking me all of these different kinds of questions about it. He asked me if it was a ""choice?"" lol. Knew I needed to leave when a couple of his friends came over and immediately started to roll a blunt. At first I was cool with it. But when Jeremy exhaled in front of me and I inhaled it....all of it, I knew it was time for me to ride. The quiz wasn't too bad though. We made a bet that whoever gets the lower grade has to treat the other to lunch. It doesn't matter to me either way. Everybody has to eat. Just found out that Yogi is coming home Friday instead of Thursday. Kinda mad cause we were suppose to go out Thursday. And I wanted to take her shopping for clothes to wear to the concert on Friday. So, I guess Thursday. I will take the car to get an oil change. And get the eyebrows done. And spend any other money I want to pass time. About to go to work. But i want to post a pic.

The writing says....Uppity Negress. ""I don't pick cotton."" My parents didn't like what the shirt said. That's understandable. But they said that it was too much for little Hinesville. That's crazy. The shirt is not racist. I'm not racist. Yogi is not fully black. In fact, she's more Indian than anything. Kathy is white. Sticks is white. The confederate dixie shirts are more racist than anything. Uppity Negro is suppose to be an African American Awareness Movement that began in Washington, D.C. According to the founder, white, black, green, or grizzly people can be an uppity negro. To learn more information, <a href=""http://uppitynegro.com/"">Uppity Negro</a>."

So, yes. I'm in the Ville once again. Came home to visit the family and to get some comfort after being away from Yogi for so long. I miss her. For my first 'event', I went out to breakfast with Sticks. Have't talked to that girl in the Lord knows how long. But it was a good reunion. Reminisced on old times; caught up with the new. According to her (my trusty know everybody's business sidekick), everybody in the Ville that graduated '04 is either futurally engaged, engaged, married, divorced, or pregnant. I'm glad I got ""the hell outta dogde"" as the old saying goes. But you never know about the futurally engaged part. <i>thinks in her mind</i>

In other news, my sister got a 3 week old puppy for Daiton. It is so cute, I have to give it that. It's sad though. Because of it being so young, it is seeking out its mother and fellow pups. I say ""it"" because it doesn't have a name as of yet. However, Daiton calls it Dog. So the name has stuck for now.

Most often the answer to that question is yes, you are. And its okay. Most people are annoying cause if you aren't annoying to one person, somebody else probably thinks you're annoying or triflin, phony, fake or other words that best fit the situation. I personally think that I annoy some people. In fact, I annoy myself sometimes when I think about what I just did or used to do in the past. But if you ask most people about me that think they honestly know me, most would say that I'm a... ""<i>cool cat....chilled all the time and down to earth</i>.""

Past couple of days have been busy for me. School, work, and no <i>play</i>. I'm just glad that I didn't have to physically go to class on Monday or today. Online class is for me! Went to workout today. Wanted to clear my mind. But it didn't work. My mind was too full of negativity and emotions. Last night, my convo with Yogi went from playful to serious in a couple of comments. I hate it when she's upset with me especially when she's 3 and 1/2 hours away. I can't put my <i>mojo</i> on her lol. Today at work wasn't so bad. Pretty chill. Last night, they did inventory and cleaned it up before I had to work. Lovely. But last night I had to put all of the clothes on the rack before I could leave. Didn't get outta there until 10:30. Mad about that but will gladly cash that check. A woman came in the store today with a tribe of kids. She was a pretty African American female with dreads. And all of her kids had dreads. That made me start to wonder if her kids will love her or hate her for doing that to them. It is so much work to get them undone that most people just shave their head. I don't think I would want to dread a baby's hair. That's seems to me like a life changing decision that that individual should make.

After work, I had to stop and get some gas. Didn't really want to considering that I'm going out of town Friday, but needed to because I wouldn't have made it to the showing of Grease in Piedmont Park. All this month, they are showing movies every Thursday. Last week, me and Yogi went and saw Mommy Dearest. The movie was crazy, but interesting. Here is a pic of the festivities.....<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v11/yogislaw/movieinthepark.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""></center>. Anyway, after I finished pumping gas and the pump printed my receipt, an elderly homeless man walked up on me. During our two minute convo, he told me not to be afraid. He asked for money. I denied him. He told me I was pretty. I thanked him. He said that he was ugly. I disagree to make him feel better. And the next part was us going back and forth with the you take care and stay safe. But the thing that hit me was that he told me that people love me and I should go home to them. Homeless people are very often stereotyped to be evil crackhead who only want to buy alcohol and would never amount to anything. Dont get me wrong most fit the description but there are some who actually want help and don't know where to get it."

Classes: 
     COMPUTER SKILLS FOR INFORM AGE - IT 2010
This class is cool, I guess. The first day, we learned about e-mail. Basically, I should get an A, or come damn near close. The teacher doesn't take roll or anything and is always late, so she's straight already except for one thing. She didn't order any books, so NONE of the bookstores placed an order for books, so now, I'm having to buy books offline. This is not entirely a bad thing because I got a $80 or more book for $20 and some change. I'm pleased. 

     MUSC/SKEL FUNCTION HUMAN PER I - KH 2220
Let me tell you about this class. First of all, the book situation is the same as my other class which is Half.com here I come. The teacher is straight from India. He still has his very strong accent, but the class is interesting....<i>to me</i>. There's one plus to this class. I think that I've found somebody to study with if I need it. And I was fortunate that he had the book I needed for the IT class."

"event","suddenly realised why one feels much more relaxed and at ease when one is overseas. 
travel light is the key. 
everything is shrunk, 
everything becomes disposable and redundant.

wonder why is it that this can't be the case when one is at home. 

wonder why is there a need to hold on to everything so tightly when one is at home.

wonder why one is at home but yet not at ease."

"event","had planned to go buy some cloth for a friend. but alas, it started raining heavily and that gave me an excuse to stay indoors.

last night, while having tea at a coffee place, a thought crept up to me. a habit I thought was long gone with age was never really gone. it just hid itself in a cosy little corner, waiting to rise to the surface when the time is right. last night, it gave me a little prelude.

a friend was reading a book on solitude last night. 

&quot;X is afraid of loneliness,&quot; said she. &quot;This became more apparent after reading the book.&quot;

I stared at her, unable to agree, both the statement and the person making that statement.

&quot;We are all afraid of loneliness,&quot; said I.

&quot;Well, not in the way you define loneliness. X is really afraid of being lonely. It's a feeling which I am not able to describe at this moment.&quot; With that my friend turned and returned to her work.

I, too, turned away, only because I needed a space to think.

Space, is what I fear most of losing at the end of the day. Space is what I crave for when things get too intimate. Does that make me any less vulnerable to loneliness then?

what is it that my friend understood about solitude that brought about the statement last night?

is reading a chapter enough for one to fully grasp the true meaning of solitude? if so, what then is the purpose of the rest of the book?

my senses told me that there was a lot of angst in my friend last night.

my senses also told me that a book is just a book. some readers choose to read what they want to read at that particular moment in life. 

does it really make solitude more bearable if you can find someone who is more fearful of loneliness? 

at the end of the day, we are all afraid of being alone. so why then do you force yourself to be above the notion of solitude when at the heart of it (at this very moment, at least) you are afraid and doesn't want to walk on the misty path alone?

if you need a hand to hold, you will first need to hold out your hand. 

you can still hold on to that book, but please don't forget, you still have your other hand."

"event","sunday afternoon, lazy.

the rain is all i want to hear but too bad, the radio from the kitchen is too loud to be ignored.

perhaps it's just me,

the rain here always makes the air stifling,

bringing out the worst possible smells.

before the rain, 

the air is hot and suffocating.

during the rain,

the air is hot and suffocating.

after the rain,

the air is still

the same

often, i wonder how many people actually take the time out to observe and enjoy such a trivial thing as the rain.

somehow, i believe that everyone has the capacity to feel

everyone is looking

but how many are acknowledging the things they see?

to see, to look,

to hear, to listen

these are nothing but mere word plays

is it really that tiring to think? 

that is probably the question 

think,

our thoughts are often random

think

is there a so-called right and wrong in thinking?

think, 

if it's random,

it shouldn't be too tiring

think 

if there is no right or wrong,

it should be exciting

(perhaps it's just me)

at the end of the post,

there is no message to be told.

before i start on the post,

i knew that there will be no point in this post

after all, 

my thoughts are random

and from this randomness, 

i try to make sense of the world around

of the rain

of the radio 

and of the other sounds.

after all,

this is the first sunday i get to laze around

the first of the many sundays where i don't have to struggle against the soulless wanderer in me

after all,

this is my blog,

and i can type in nonsensical &quot;free verse&quot; for all i want

(if you had noticed, that is)"

"event","am told to create something virtual and untouchable using very concrete materials.

perspectives is the key.

purpose, is what i would ask.

if something is not meant to be held, why bother to try and capture it?

why the insistence to hold such a thing?

purpose, my friend, not just mere perspectives.

perhaps i should take a step back and try to comprehend the rationale and logic behind such an act?

perhaps not. 

after all, before i could rationalize, u would have already showered my logic with contempt.

gosh, how then am i supposed to know what's running through your head?

how then am i supposed to create what you want?

such is the tragedy.

one being rendered as the executioner in the name of a creator.

think god being a puppet,

controlled by an invisible self-proclaimed greater being.

"event","watched The Reader a few days ago. surprisingly, i found it all too predictable. the problem lies not with the film though. cos frankly speaking, the film is quite good. the cast is also very strong. 

it's just me. i have grown to lose my ability to appreciate such a film. a genre which has suddenly become too intellectual for me."

"event","had my first terrible nightmare last night. for the first time, i actually fear sleeping. i wasn't dreaming about monsters or ghosts. in fact, those might have been easier to deal with. instead, i was fighting against an invisible force. a force so powerful that it's presence filled the whole room and set me trembling in a kind of fear unknown to myself prior to last night. a fear so great that i could feel my bed shaking. in fact, the whole room was shaking so fervently that it felt like i was in the core of an earthquake. 

the more my bed shook, the more i struggle to wake up. something in me tells me that i have to wake up at that moment or else i never would. 

i remembered trying to scream for help but i could not make a single sound. 

then my dad's alarm clock went. with the help of that external sound, i managed to break free whatever was holding on to me and woke up. as i laid with my eyes open, my first thought was to wonder if i had been watching too much Miyazaki's animation. in fact, the nightmare did feel a little like Miyazaki's style. the fear was as real as it could get though.

i wonder if the same thing would happen again tonight. i hope it won't though. cos if it does, it's probably a sign that my mind is on it's way of breaking down. 

the mind is a terrible thing to lose.

i wonder what would have happened if i didn't try to wake up last night.

i wonder, is this how people die in their sleep?

i wonder but i doubt i would like to find out for myself."

"event","will be going for New Balance's Real Run in a few hour's time. am really not very motivated to go simply because it's super far away and it's super early. and it's on a Sunday! however, since i kind of promised my friend that i will take part in the run, i thought i would go after all. it might not be a bad thing to lengthen my Sunday for once and get all my long overdue errands done. but there could also be the possibility of me sleeping the rest of the Sunday away after the run. haha.. we'll see.

watched &quot;Love Exposure&quot; last night. it's a Korean flim about women and their views on marriage, love and sex. it is touted as Korea's Sex and the City. the film is light-hearted and fun but i didn't particularly like it. in fact, after watching the movie, what stayed in my mind was the relationship between women and their sunglasses. 

in the film, one of the protagonists love wearing sunglasses. sunglasses, when worn suitably, can add an element of glamour to women. however, other than a fashion statement, are there any other reasons for women to wear sunglasses? are they trying to hide behind those shades? hide away their tears, hide away their fears, hide away their tiredness?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;If I Were Superman&quot; is a film about a man who believes that he is Superman and his sole mission in life is to save the world. by adopting the identity of Superman, Man is happy as he can escape from the cruel reality. the reality is cruel for Man as he is unable to link his memories with his emotions. the premise and story of the film is very interesting. however, there is something about the execution of the film that stops me from loving it. my friend, on the other hand, loves the film. she loves it for the structure, how the director juxtaposes the feeling of happiness with extreme sadness. perhaps the structure is indeed brilliant but it still did not speak to me when i was in the darken auditorium.

if i were superman, i would run away. but i don't have to be a superman to make you smile or to save you from an oncoming car.

"event","i am back from the country of red, white and blue. my soul is still drifting and my mind is still a little blue. not because i really missed the place so much. but more because of the many things that happened within that short span of time. it has been an emotional roller coaster ride for me. it is the kind of roller coaster ride which lingers on for a very long time after the ride. the kind of ride which i would love to hate and hate to love. however, at the end of the day, it is one ride which i am glad i took.<br /><br />i went to watch 2 getais last night. the performance element in a getai has always been very jarring to me. everything on stage is meant to be a show, from the lights to the sound to the host to the singers. it is purely entertainment. the audience are there for a good laugh. the performers are perpetually pandering to the audience too. as i sat there behind the getai crowd, i cannot but help to wonder why the performers choose to perform at getais. can i even go as far as asking if the performers get any sense of gratification pandering to the audience? or perhaps that is not important at all, even in other kinds of performances? also, other than money, is there any other motivation for going on stage? where do they intend to go from there? perhaps they don't even consider so much?<br /><br />whatever the reason may be for their appearances on stage, one undeniable fact is the amazing showmanship some of the performers have. it is incredible to see little girls of in their early teens owning the stage, the audience and shinning brighter than the neon lights. their stage presence make me feel ashamed to call myself a performer. as i get mesmerized by their presence and spontaneity on stage, i began to wonder if what they have is natural talent or it is something that came about with practice. at the same time, i was a little disturbed at how mature the young performers are on stage. for me, i always feel that children should be innocent and pure. in fact, it would be ideal if everyone, young and old can keep this childlike quality in them. however, more and more children are being forced to grow up and abandon this childlike innocence. are we really that hard up for time that we cannot afford to let our younger generation grow up at their own pace? are we really that pressed for time that we cannot even afford to give our younger generation the luxury of a truly pure and innocent childhood? do we really need them to grow up instantly? what is the rush, seriously?<br /><br />children should always be children so let them be. let them enjoy the simplicity of running around in an open space screaming and shouting. let them fall and pick themselves up. let them be amazed by the clouds in the sky and the rainbow after the rain. let them chase after bubbles, birds and butterflies. let the wind caress their faces and ruffle through their hair. let them be simple, let them be free. let their souls wander, explore and soar. at the end of the day, let children be children.<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/halrickbin/Nightmare-Before-Christmas.jpg"" alt="""" />"

"event","today, my lao peng you took me to a posh-looking Japanese restaurant for my birthday celebration. the food there was delicious and the atmosphere was quite charming. not to forget, the Japanese dark beer was tasty too. then despite my lao peng you's many seemingly insistent ""no""s, we headed off to Red Dot Brewhouse for drinks. i have never been to Red Dot before and was very intrigued by the fact that they sell green lager that supposedly can prevent AIDS. seems like a must-go-and-check-it-out kind of a place.<br /><br />Red Dot was a cosy, little place with it's own pond and complete with it's own trees, nicely tucked away from the busy road. the green lager, aptly named the green monster, was quite nice. i had failed to get a full taste of the booze simply because the ground drank almost 90% of the contents in the super fragile glass. super fragile cos the glass broke into a million pieces when i accidentally knocked it over in my attempt to explain my near-death experience in Bangkok. the glass broke and my thumb bled. not at the same time, of course. actually, i would have avoided the bloodshed had i not pressed my thumb onto the broken glass. i stared at the remains of the broken glass for a second or two and return to my narration of my near-death experience. while my friends were concerned to find out if i had cut myself, i was overtly concerned with finishing up my tale. i knew i had cut my thumb and was actually waiting for the blood to ooze out of the wounds. as i indulge in the ever-so familiar numbing sensation, i began to wonder if i had wanted to cut myself subconscious. i certainly hoped not, for that would be too sick a thought, wouldn't it?<br /><br />in any case, the wounds are superficial and will probably heal completely in a week or so. sometimes, physical wounds are much easier to bear, if not, more enjoyable, than non-physical wounds. after all, with physical wounds, one can see the progression -- from the cut to the blood to the numbing sensation.<br /><br />in any case, Red Dot is a nice place to chill out. they provide handyplast for all physical wounds and they do not charge you for the broken glasses. their waitresses are also gentler than some nurses. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/halrickbin/36188219.jpg"" />"

"event","went for a sleepover at a friend's house last night. woke up considerably early to a lazy Sunday at a place far away from my home. my soul was still drifting when i woke up but after a cold shower, my soul finally caught up with the rest of me. my room mate for the night let out a seemingly choreographed yawn as i was packing my bag. however, this time round, i chose not to respond to anyone or anything. i was enjoying having my soul with me on a Sunday morning. i wasn't thinking of anything in particular. in fact, my mind was pretty much a blank but i was enjoying not having to concretize those wandering thoughts in a moment like this. everything was surreal yet grounded. everything was moving and yet still. there seemed to be a mutual consensus in that air of silence. for once, i did not find the physical intrusion of space a matter of concern. everyone was moving in the same space but everyone was in their own space at the same time. whatever physical movements did not disrupt the tranquil air.

as we sat in the bus in search for breakfast, my friend commented that Singaporeans in general have only 2 rhythmic modes -- the Weekday mode and the Sunday mode. on Sundays, most people would wander around their neighbourhood lazily. this then can be further sub-catergorised as Sunday mode in the neighbourhoods and Sunday mode in the city area. the former is an idyllic painting while the latter is a mad rush to fully utilised the remains on a work-free day.

and since i was in a neighbourhood, i decided to devoted completely to painting that picture of idyllic bliss.

and so the day went on, where each moment could not be more peaceful and each breath of air could not be more calm.

not all who wander is lost. and sometimes, wandering can be good for the soul."

"event","found a new friend in an old one recently. it's scary. it's like the silence right after rounds and rounds of laughter -- piercing. the silence cuts through the remains of the quiet night like a newly sharpened knife. the blade is still hot from all that grinding. the process of knowing someone under the normal speed is assuringly normal. whereas getting to know someone at the speed of light leaves you lost and hollow, forcing you to acknowledge the abundance of space in the universe. it is the moment right after a roller coaster ride, just before you step out of the cart. it is that brief and transient moment when your soul finally catches up with your body and your mind regains full function. suddenly, you think about how you could have just died, how you could have regretted risking your life for a moment of silly adrenalin rush. the strange silence that builds up all around gets more and more daunting as everyone reflect in unison in the absolute silence.&nbsp; <br /><br />the roller coaster is a roller coaster. the risk of riding on a roller coaster doesn't increase with time. however, as you get older, you tend to get more reluctant to take that risk. as you get older, you seem more concerned about the silence that follows the screams and the silence gets more and more hollow as you age. the silence hits home with increasing accuracy as time passes. you get sick and tired of trying, investing and attaching. most importantly, you get tired of risking.<br /><br />while the mind is a philosopher, the heart is a sadist. it finds comfort in this adrenalin rush. it yearns for the laughter, knowing very well that the silence is lurking round the corner. it feeds on this joyous sound. it thrives on such a roller coaster ride. it grows as the cart twists and turns. it grows as the cart travels at the speed of light. it grows as the cart flings itself out into the vast universe. it grows and eventually, it gets consumed by the menacing black hole.<br /><br />and after all that laughter, the silence is haunting. what then am i supposed to do?<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/halrickbin/116.jpg"" alt="""" />"

(well, this season may seem off-peak on the surface, but the undercurrents are definitely strong. i am just doing my best to prepare myself for the inevitable storm.) perhaps because i am merely flying off to a land nearby for a few days. since there won't be any electricity most of the time, i decided to do away with most of my gadgets and travel light. that could also explain the lightness in mood too. usually when it comes to packing, my gadgets always give me a bit of a headache. <br /><br />in any case, it feels like packing for a sleepover and not an overseas trip. <br /><br />sometimes i missed getting excited about travelling. it's always interesting to hear people counting down to their trips.recently someone was counting down -- 100 days to his trip. i really must take my hat off him. because if i were to count down like him, i would be bored even before i reach 90. <br /><br />this time round, i am travelling with the least likely company. in fact, i never thought i would go on a holiday with them because our personalities just seem so different. but by a stroke of spontaneous act, we decided to pack our bags and take flight within a couple of weeks. the whole holiday idea was tossed seemingly casually over dinner and before i know it, we've booked our hotel and flights. gosh, considering that this time it only took me 2 weeks to grab my passport and leave on a jet plane, perhaps it won't be long before i decided to grab my bags and leave on a jet plane on the spot. that would certainly be an interesting experience. think perhaps i should give such a casual act some serious thoughts. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/halrickbin/Alan%20Rickman/photo6.jpg"" />"

"event","am playing James Blunt on the loop this time round. i remember someone once told me that you can get sick and tired of James Blunt after a while. sick and tired of some guy with a hight pitched voice singing pathetically sad songs, about unrequited love, about desolate souls.<br /><br />but we all need to be reminded of our pathetic existence once in a while, don't we?<br /><br />indulge in a little self pity, drown in one's mirage of melancholy so as to emerge a better person?<br /><br />i doubt so. <br /><br />it's more like a lame excuse, if you ask me. like coming up with an excuse to eat chocolates when you are down with a terrible sore throat.<br /><br />James Blunt is still in the loop and it's beginning to sound cheesy.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/halrickbin/Alan%20Rickman/AR-1.jpg"" />"

"event","it's been 8 weeks since the last entry. wow! certainly didn't feel that long. 8 weeks translates to 2 months. ah, yes those busy 2 months. the thing with time is that it seems to get shorter and shorter as one gets older. very often, the day is gone before one can get anything done. i can start the day at 8am and still i hardly get to see the sun for long. no, i no longer work in some underground tunnels. <br /><br />and when one comes online, everyone wants a portion of your time. sigh, no wonder i never get anything constructive done the moment i sign in to msn. but i still sign in, cos there are people whom i wanted to talk to. then there are those whom u wish u can be so heartless as to block them. those that asks u the same things day in day out, like ""how's your day?"" and then rattle on to say how attractive they are to the opposite sex. hello? you are certainly not attractive to this opposite sex the moment you start to rattle on. but i shldn't be tempted to block them cos i will get bad karma. hahaha..<br /><br />i wish i have more time for myself. time to be with myself. time to talk to myself. time to straighten out those thoughts after a long day at work. time to reflect about the past, present and future. time to think. time to read. time to write. of course, not forgetting, time to breathe. it's during time like this that i cannot comprehend why anyone would complain about being bored or lonely. there are so many things i want to do with me and i can never find enough time to be alone. loneliness is a luxury. loneliness is cathartic. loneliness is beyond zen?<br /><br />there are so many books to be read, so many dvds to be watched and so many thoughts to be straightened out. how can anyone find that there is nothing to do? if there is really nothing to do, there is always sleep to catch up on. i need more time to be with myself. well, perhaps i have just stated the reason for me to be left on the shelf 10 years down the road. sigh. but i still need time for myself. <br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/halrickbin/Alan%20Rickman/LoveActually.jpg"" />"

Anyone Else But You

Kimya: You're a part time lover and a full time friend
The monkey on you're back is the latest trend

Adam: I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Adam: I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Kimya: Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Adam: The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't, you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Kimya: I will find my nitch in your car
With my mp3 DVD rumple-packed guitar
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
Both:
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu du

Kimya: Up up down down left right left right B A start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Adam: You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Kimya: We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Adam: Don Quixote was a steel driving man. My name is Adam I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Kimya: Squinched up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

Both:
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu du

"event","<strong><br />I recently rediscovered my live journal account, and naturally began sifting through old entries. <br />Faded memories were dusted off ; it was so easy to go back into that moment in time. <br />Re-reading of Matt's death I felt my heart sink as it did then, that lump in my throat reappeared, and tears welled in my eyes just as they did 4 or so years ago. &nbsp;It leaves me questioning if I ever really dealt with the grief. <br />To be honest I didn't know how. <br />Death is not something one can simply 'get over', &nbsp;some feelings of loss and sadness are likely to remain. <br />I had lost touch with Matt a couple months before he died, and was overwhelmed with guilt. I continue to feel this.<br />So when I cry, is it because I miss him? Is it because his life was too short? Or is it because I continue to be burdened with guilt for letting our friendship fade? Does it have to be one or the other? Maybe it is both.<br />Logically I understand that nobody could have predicted his untimely death. I also know that it is unrealistic to expect to be as close with someone now and still be in that position years from now. People grow apart, its a natural progression as we all make our own paths...but this isn't comforting, it does not make Matt's death any less painful. <br />Feelings aren't &nbsp;logical. <br />But we cannot deny ourselves an emotion simply because&nbsp;we can't reason it with logic. <br />We have to allow ourselves to feel the pain if we ever want to get through it.&nbsp;<br /></strong>"

"event","Earlier this week I went to the spring concert at school, it was amazingly good, i dont understand why more people dont go. I recorded some of it ...and was watching it back this morning, and it made me unbelieveably depressed...which i know sounds retarded...but it brought back memories of when i was in band. I guess i never realized how much fun I actually had, and how much I loved it. I am really regreting my decision to quit band...I feel like I'm missing a part of me now. I kind of feel like I didnt stay in it because I didnt want to be labeled a band geek...but the truth is...that is who I am...now I feel like I was trying to be someone im not.Now its too late to do anything about it...so I'll just have to get my band intake by going to all the concerts...but its not so much the concerts I liked about band...it was the social aspect, the trips, the memories...I miss it."

<P>I swear the only reason people have children is to use them as slaves lol. at 6:30 in the morning, yes 6:30, I was outside shoveling snow. We pay this guy to plow out our driveway, I dont know why we bother paying him, because he never comes when it snows!! My parents get me outside shoveling them out of the snow, and they leave(thanks to me haha) before the plow guy even comes. useless is what he is. stealing our money...making me get bundled up and go outside at such an hour, I'm not impressed. oh well...at least it did wake me up a bit. </P>
<P>The plan for today...because there is no school is:</P>
<P><BR>1. Make muffins (check)</P>
<P>2. Make cookies in the shape of hearts, with red surgary sprinkles on top</P>
<P>3. Make valentines (out of bordem)</P>
<P>4. Finish my homework (teehee...good thing there's no school)</P>
<P>5. Have a snowball fight</P>
<P>6. Go snowboarding</P>

So...I had nobody to talk to...so all I could do was watch the game, silently, and look like a loser haha.</FONT> <FONT size=4>They ended up losing 3-0...it was pretty depressing lol.

<P><FONT color=#ff6600 size=4>After the game wasn't to bad, because Mitch,Colin and Matt&nbsp;were there to talk to...so I didn't feel like a complete loner...Jill Chad and Laura were there too, I wish I had of seen them before so I could of hung out with them but I didnt see them until the game was over...oh well...I'll just make sure somebody comes with me next time, I know this sounds pathetic, but I was really scared sitting by myself...not because I looked like a loner...but because I was just honestly afraid...<IMG id=mood_image_preview alt="""" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/charitycam/stars/scared.gif"">I don't really know why.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999 size=4>SO...after the game...I called my father to come pick me up...he said 20 minutes...but...it was more like 40. I was the last one there, other then the people on the ice practicing...I stood there for what seemed like an eternity...I was SOO bored...I was reading all the stuff on the bulletin board...counting ceiling tiles, you know...the usual routine you do when you are suffering from bordem. I was just standing there reading when Dan came out...I figured he would have already left,&nbsp;seen as his enitre team already had...but no, he was still there...I think he was getting a drive home with Tim Jones(who kind of intimidates me...but I guess alot of people do), cuz he stood there waiting for him while he was talking to me...anyways...needless to say, we didnt really get to talk for long cuz Tim was waiting for him, but he told me not to be shy and to call him sometime...which he does basically everytime we talk. I have called him a couple times...but it's so akward, I HATE phones...in my opinion...they're for making plans....not for long conversations...unless its one of my girlfriends...then I find it quite easy to talk for a good 2 hours. so why can't I with Dan...because we have almost nothing in common. Thats why. me and the girls can talk about field hockey or our french homework, without sounding stupid...but i feel like such an idiot if i talk labout stuff he probably isnt interested in...but&nbsp;it's all I have to talk about, because I have no life!!!</FONT></P>

"event","I just had the most amazing,and sweet dream. *sigh* I wish it had been true. I woke up with a smile on my face...and continued to daydream. It made me so happy, why couldn't it be real?! :<.

This may just sound retarded to you...but...you know how dreams are...they make so much more sense in your head, and they're kind of hard to describe.

It's snowing outside, and I look out the window, and I see him, he's writing a message in the snow (for me), he doesn't know i'm watching, I just smile and continue to look out the window. I can't exactly remember what the message said, I just remember it was sweet, and I felt so completely happy.

now...this part, you may think i'm a complete freak that obsesses over field hockey too much

He then began to make lines in the snow, he made a field!! he then came and got me, with field hockey sticks in his hand, and we had a playful game in the snow. which ended in him tackling me, us lieing in the snow, and then he kissed me.

sigh

i know...im wierd
it was a dream okay! lol"

"event","It's been a while since I've wrote in this...alot has happened,school's out for christmas break, but unfortunatly I will have to be going back tomorrow morning.
This christmas break has been awesome, aside from my pathetic moments of depression.
Let me reminisce, and tell you of the highlights of this break.

1. I went on a trip to cape breton with my family to visit my nephew zach, he is completely adorable, which made the agonizing 7 hour drive there, in a cramped van, bareable.

2. I went to Britt's dinner party, it was awesome, it was exciting to get all dolled up and fancy even if it was just for some of our best friends who have seen us at our worst...there was so much fun, food, photos and dancing! 

3. Christmas!! This year my family hosted a formal dinner party, and invited my huge family over...unfortunatly, it seems my mother forgot to inform people it was formal, which left me feeling a bit overdone...but whatever...It was still awesome...smashing the gingerbread house, exchanging gifts and of course eating the food me and my mom made in tthe early housrs the night before. Seriously we slaved in the kitchen forever.

4. Boxing Day Shopping!! I went into town, and practically the entire population of the island was there throwing there money away. I didn't buy much, but i did finally get to meet Matt, Rachel's beau.

5. FIELD HOCKEY! I love it so much, so, just getting to play in the winter is a major highlight for me, I dont care what team I make, I just wanna play. It's hard to believe you can be so passionate about chasing a ball around with sticks that look like golf clubs, but I am. I love it so much. 

6.New Years...stayed up all by myself...seriously, I was alone it sucked...no midnight kiss for me. I guess thats not really a highlight then is it?

7. The Myrons dance! God that was fun aside from the fact you got soaking wet in sweat after 2 minutes on the dance floor. There were so many people there. Me, Ashton, Brittany, Erica, Chelsey, Katie, Emilie, Kathryn and a ton of other people were there. The music was great, and the break dancers were awesome. And Daniel was pretty cute too. haha I hope he's not reading this. When I was dancing with him, I'd look into his eyes...damn I wanted to kiss him...that sounds so corny..but its true. He didn't try grab my ass, which it seemed all the guys were doing..at first I guess I wouldn't have minded...but after I thought about it...I appreciate he didn't, it made me feel like he respected me. Maybe next time I'll get a good night kiss. *sigh*"

"event","Awww, Alyssa and Q had there first official date friday night...they are so cute together...and apparently q's mom took a picture of alyssa to africa with her :S, kinda wierd, but cute! Yes, I'm talking about someone else's life...but only because I dont have one of my own! It's actually really pathetic, I feel sorry for myself. lol. I am really a loner..okay..my daily routine at school is...go to class, at lunch I am either in the library,wandering around the school...by myself, or just following people(not in a stalkerish way)...I feel like the only person I have deep conversations with now these days is my brother...If I didnt have him I'd die. the only reason he listens to me is because he can't escape me at hoem:P, seriously I have no life...I went withmy brother and his girlfriend shopping and stuff...I mean, we're friends, but...shouldn't I have my own friends that I do stuff with? I have a small social circle but hopefully i can expand that soon...I seriously feel like such a loner!!

  
Tonnight is the social event of the season haha, actually...I'm just hanging out with James, it's his birthday...we're just gonna watch movies and stuff it'll be awesome! I hope he likes his b'day gift, and his christmas gift...I was on a bit of a budget...I only have 27 bucks left in my bank account :O!
 
 
Last Sunday I went to britt's show, it was awesome! but...hun...I'm pretty sure it wasn't joel...cuz I was talking to evan, and he said Joel wasn't in the band or something...but I didnt even see him..If I had, ida been able to tell you if it was him or not. Me and joel go back lol, actually he probably forgets I exist...lol good ole 4-H...shhhhhh dont tell anyone :P. I saw joel the other day when I was x-mas shopping...he kinda looked at me funny.. I laughed. I'm all ready for christmas! just haveta finish wrapping gifts and the like of that. Anyways...I better go and get out of my P.J.'s!"

"event","Another snowday...my Aunt and cousin we're storm stayed here last night, they're pretty happy there wasnt any school cuz my cousin didnt have any of her stuff here. Me and my aunt had to get up at 6:00 in the morning to help my mom get out of the drive way....damn, were those wheels ever spinning...we had to shovel the car out of the snowbank...surprisingly it was actually kinda nice outside...not too stormy...i'm not sure why they cancelled school...the roads must have been bad. Other then that it has been a fairly uneventful day...I'm just debating on whether I should go to semi tomorrow or not...cuz i can't go to britt's dinner party:( but I dont want my new dress to go to waste. anyways...that was boring...later"

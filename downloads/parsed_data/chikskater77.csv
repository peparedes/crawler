It was not so funny...but I enjoy Fred Savage. Then I watched E.R. adn that was pretty much it. Tomorrow I have government and ISM which should be easy...oh yah...adn I made a 96 on my Choir final today. Hope you guys have a semi-decent finals week...ttyl

"event","Hey everybody. Im here to tell you about my incredibly sucky day.well...I was going too...until I talked to Anna Banana...but she made me feel better. Just to clue you guys in...I didn't get accepted into NHS, and I got told I was ugly and fat...by 2 different people. Not that that matters to you guys...but It really hurt my feelings. Sometimes I think people don't think Im human because my feelings are different from a lot of other people. And for those of you that do....POO ON YOU! cuz I do get my feelings hurt too. Im not invincible at all...I just don't tell a lot of people...and I usually cry myself to sleep at night....and I do it more often than you think. Although I don't gush over guys and have like 5 hour long conversations about them...I do like to talk about guys...and I will tell you which ones I think are hot/nice/sweet/funny and all thats in between. I love to travel....I like to do lots of things. When I can think of ways to make peoples lives easier I like to express that too. I love to take hot showers...and snowboard. I really love music. I play 4 different musical instruments, flute, piccolo,guitar, and piano. Ilove to sing and play guitar/piano.I am expected to be perfect and happy all the time. I got news for the people that think that...I'M NOT!! I like to sing in the shower. I like to keep peace between me and my friends. I think very deeply...and I never tell one person everything. I am a band nerd. After extracurricular activites...I go home with just as much homework as any other Junior. I am an extrovert. I like to eat ice cream and potato and egg breakfast tacos. I love fritos or wavy lays dipped in H-E-B French onion dip. I don't like mustard, pickels, or mayonaise. I love stuff from the 80's. I hate when people complain...it drives me insane! I like all kinds of music...even rap and bluegrass. I like all kinds of drinks (non-alcoholic). My favorite color is orange. I love God. I hate most of my classes this year. The people form school I hang out witht eh most are Sara Rodrigues, Michael Alvarez, Kellie Rowlette, and Lauren Baggett. My favorite Ice cream is strawberry shortcake. I AM NOT superwoman...although sometimes I wish I was. I like my blue eyes. I am growing my hair out to donate to Locks of Love...adn I think everybody else should too. My bedroom doesnt have 1 set theme...eventhough my bathroom does. My bedroom is done in broadway musical poasters, old baby stuff, rock stuff, and monopoly. I have a wall painted orang and a guitar painted on the opposite wall. My parents are not divorced. I am 16 years old. My birthday is 8-8-88 and I am alwayz at band camp on my birthday. I absolutely dispise the american pie joke.Ilove to wear silver jewelry and eye make-up. I really do like to wear make-up...I just hate how people point it out. I also like to go natural though. I think everybody should go natural. The world would just be a better place (I guess you could use powder for the occasional zit)...and I know the entire alphabet in sign language, english, and spanish. 

Just thought I would share some of thta cuz Im feeling frustrated right now. If any of you have any more questions...just comment and let me know...ttyl

You are an experience soul who appreciates tradition.
Mellow and wise, you like to be with others but also to be alone.
Down to earth, you are sensible and impatient.
A creature of habit, it takes you a while to warm up to new people.

You hate injustice, and you're very protective of family and friends
A bit demanding, you expect proper behavior from others.
Extremely independent you don't mind living or being alone.
But when you find love, you tend to want marriage right away.

I ate lunch and just as I was getting ready to crash I got a call rom Zach Jewell telling me that I should have answered my phone and that I neede to call him back...so I did. He wanted me to go hang out with him and Zch V and kept buggingme about it. after6 min of arguing...I finally got to go to sleep. I slept 3 1/2 hours and then went to the church and ran teh teleprompter for ""Word on the street"" that was fun...then we had the cast partay. Good tamales I might add. anywayz..
Today I went and saw Lemony Snickett's A series of unfortunate events. I didn't think it was that great. It was actually really weird. I also saw the preview for the re-sone version of Willy WOnka and the Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp as Willy WOnka. That looked strange too.Well anwayz enuff about my boring life...oh yah...im done with Physical Therapy and I don't have to wear the KNee brace anymore (unless Im like running and stuff) WOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

"event","We have some power corruption going on in band. Its horrible. We have freshman thinking that they know everything about marching after 1 game so they are telling other freshman and upperclassman how to march or to fix what they are doing wrong. We also have seniors who have no respect for authority. For any of you that don't know...I am a band officer.I have a Senior that totally disrespected my authority today not to mention the ugly looks and the attitude. I could have given this person push-ups but this person wouldnt have done them...so I just went to the directors. Hopefully she won't feel like fighting/gettin her dad to do anything about it. Band is so frustrating. GRRRR ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had forgotten to do homework in Algebra 2 today too. I also went to spanish...we had a sub...the sub spoke no spanish but we got some really hard worsheets that I couldnt do..grrr... In English 3 my teacher thinks im a smart alec. I really don't care tho. Im supposed to be in AP anywayz but my teacher last year wouldnt let me because I had a 79 and not an 80. So im stuck in a class thats meaningless to me becuase I already know everyhting shes teaching. I talked to her about it and told her that I get bored and thats a really bad thing(most of you know its a bad thing when I get bored)She told em that she wasnt boring but that she liked students like me because I was bright. Today I wasnt really in the mood because all that band crap happened after this class but there was more that happened this morning. I didn't feel like answering any of the questions and then when I did....She told me that I was being a snobby smart alec. Oh well....I don't care...Im already sick of school. So that was pretty much my day...crappy ike all the rest of the school days have been for a couple days now. anywayz....if you need me call me...ttyl

On Friday night we were supposed to have a band thing...like an ice cream social but we didnt...and I felt bad cuz I had already told Claire that I couldnt come to their party...so me and a group of my friends went to Lazer Qust. We havent done that in a really lon time. I love Lazer Quest. We played 3 games and then went home. Last night I went to Sancuary and then helped Zach V. and Mike put together the youth table that was in the back this morning. We had fun. There was too much psychoticness in 1 room...lol. This morning I got up and went to church and then after...Jordan T. and I went to TC's for some good eatin. We sorta skipped out on SS but thats ok....cuz it was fun. We were gunna take our taco's back but ended up sitting in my car and eating then in the parking lot while talking about life. I love our deep maeningful conversations that Jordan and I have (SBC ALL THE WAY)...(Thats for you too Jessica).After we ate our taco's we went back and came just in time to do the group discussion. I plan to now go shopping for a couple last minute things for school. Oh yah....yesterday...after searching long and hard all over town...I finally got a backpack.Its a really Kool Jansport. I can take the camel back bladder and put it in my bag with teh plastic thingy that you drink ater out of...and it can go through my backpack.

"event","I am now officially legal to drive everywhere and anywhere...woohooo!!!! Yesterday I spent the entire day at Schlitterbahn with everybody from church pretty much. I went with both zach's jordan...preston...sean....rich...and Mike. WE had fun the coountless times we were tipped by and unnamed person (it starts with an m and ends with an e) At lunch we went back and ate of course. I had a cheeseburger and fries. It was kinda bad tasting...of course any burger that comes out of a plastic bag sitting under a heating lamp probably isnt all hat great. At unch while I was eating I had a frie theif....names....JESSICA....but I was nice and let her have a couple too.After lunch we went without mike and rich for mst of it. We went to the pool that continually moves you around in the east park. That was lots of fun. Then we rode the black knight...but the lines were too long tho. We beat preston and brad glaser on teh black knight...but preston swears its cuz bradley only weighs like 90 pounds...and brad swears its becasue me and Jordan got a head start. Whatever floats your boat but we won!!!A little later we went down some body slides that we found by accident while walking down a staircase just to see where it went. That was fun...we all had a wedgie picking party at the end. After that we went back adn ate funnell cakes and had lots of fun just talking. That was pretty much my day...I went home and my friend Drea brought me a b-day persent (belated of course) and then I went over there for a littel while and we hung out cuz I havent seen her all summer. If you comment it makes me happy!!

"event","Hey everbody!! Today is the big day...woohooo...im officailly legal....im 16!!!but most of you already knew that. Yesterday I met some friends at HRC for some eatin....only we were supposed to do it on one of the barges in the river except that it poured down rain...so we ate inside....but it was still really good. Thanx to all who got me gifts (i liked them all!) After that I hung out at home for a little while...and then went to Sanctuary. I didnt go out cuz I was relaly tired. Sue and Molly Schwencke...Melissa Marquez...Erica...adn Corrin Corbierre all masacred me at midnite. THey woke me up by jumping on me/my bed and told me I wasnt allowed to  comb my hair or change. (I was wearing my TRIX pajamas) They got me in the car and gave me a bag and said that I had to use one of the articles of clothing while we were at Kripy Kreme (at like 1230) they had 3 things in teh bag. A bra (33 DD) (Old Lady underwear (XXL) and they accidently stuck really pretty lip gloss in the bag. I went for the lip gloss most definately. I had a guy walk up to me and said that he liked my outfit (joking of course). After that they guy at Krispy Kreme gave us free donuts. We bought another one for each of us too. I got a raspberry filled one (YUM-YUM)They stuck 16 candles in that one jelly donut (my donut became holy) then sang happy birthday to me. I ended up eating a little candle wax too. lol..then they took me home. That was fun. I had a relaly crazy dream this morning too (I think it was the donuts) I dreamed that my dad came into my bedroom and took me out into the garage. (If you don't know...I go a new guitar case which Ive been needing)When he took me out there He had the case and when he opened it...there was my beaustiful new electric acoustic guitar I've been wanting. Too bad it was just a dream tho. At least I got half of the gift (the case) THis morning I woke up and me and my family ate cinnamon rools for my b-day...family tradition. The only thing Im doing today is spending the rest of my day at the church. We have practice and youth......thanx to all who made my birthday really special...it made me relaly happy!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","Well....today was pretty good. I woke up and went to the orthodontist before the sun rose this morning (grr on my mom for wacked out appointments) My car didnt start so she had to come ack and pick me and my dad up. We went to the orthodonis and then my dad took me to SOnic for breakfast (YUM-YUM)After that....I had band. We marched all morning as usual then went in for sectionals. One of our SL's is horrible at her job and just ticked me off all day. Then for lunch I went with Shayla, Sharla, and Cherrel...and there brother in law Anothony to McDonald's because Taco Bell was too crowded. (they are my favorite set of twins/little sister duo) That was lots of fun. I got told that if I wasnt there on Monday that I was going to have to earn my spot in or show for this year. I thought I wasnt going to be able to go to schlitterbahn but I got it all worked out...no worries. From McDonald's we went back to band for another 2 hours. After that I came home and me and my madre went to pick up El Pollo Loco (the chicken crazy) for dinner.We just finished eating...and now I am headed out to a pool party, although I don't know how much swimming were gunna get in. My mom told me that they have been having dime sized hail from CHina Grove to here. Im relaly excited cuz theres only 2 dyas till my b-day and 3 days till I get my liscence. My brother is coming home too. I think hes supposed to be here tonite. If any of you don't know...thats exciting because he never comes home. I miss him a lot. Anywayz....so I think thats about it....well...Ill talk to you all either tomorrow or sunday or sometime in the near future.

And all of a sudden I got the urge to hear that song that Jeanne Moreau sings with Jules and Jim right before she makes it with Jim for the first time. So I flipped channels and sure enough, she was singing it. I made it my MySpace song."

"event","So I found an apartment that I love. It is HUGE and pretty cheap. It's very loft-like, though I don't think it technically is one.  It's the whole top floor of a building, probably about 900 square feet.

The only problem is that walls need to be constructed for the bedrooms, because right now, there are no walls at all (except to the bathroom).

Has anyone had experience constructing walls? Is it a total pain in the ass? Expensive? We have to put doors up, too."

Texas Twang<lj-cut>

November 28, 2003, Friday, Late Edition - Final

SECTION: Section A; Page 1; Column 2; National Desk

LENGTH: 1314 words

HEADLINE: Scholars of Twang Track All the 'Y'Alls' in Texas

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex.

BODY:
""Are yew jus' tryin' to git me to talk, is that the ah-deah?""

That was the idea. John O. Greer, an architecture teacher at Texas A&M University, sat at his dining table between two interrogators and their tape recorder. They had precisely 258 questions for him. But it waddn what he said that interested them most. It was how he said it.

Those responses, part of an ambitious National Geographic Society survey of Texas speech, with its ""y'alls,"" ""might-coulds"" and ""fixin' to's,"" are helping language investigators throw a scientific light on a mythologized and sometimes ridiculed mainstay of Americana: the Texas twang.

Among the unexpected findings, said Guy Bailey, a linguistics professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio and a leading scholar in the studies with his wife, Jan Tillery, is that in Texas more than elsewhere, how you talk says a lot about how you feel about your home state.

""Those who think Texas is a good place to live adopt the flat 'I' -- it's like the badge of Texas,"" said Dr. Bailey, 53, provost and executive vice president of the university and a transplanted Alabamian married to a Lubbock native, also 53.

So if you love Texas, they say, be fixin' to say ""naht"" for ""night,"" ""rahd"" for ""ride"" and ""raht"" for ""right.""

And by all means say ""all"" for ""oil.""

In addition to quickly becoming enamored of Western garb like cowboy boots and hats, big-buckled belts, western shirts and vests, newcomers to the state -- and there are a lot of them -- are especially likely to adopt the lingo pronto.

At the same time, the speech of rural and urban Texans is diverging, Dr. Bailey said. Texans in Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio are sounding more like other Americans and less like their fellow Texans in Iraan, Red Lick or Old Glory.

Indeed, Dr. Tillery and Dr. Bailey wrote in a recent paper called ""Texas English,"" a new dialect of Southern American English may be emerging on the West Texas plains. It is not what a linguist might expect, they wrote, ""but this is Texas, and things are just different here.""

The changes are being tracked by researchers for the two San Antonio linguists, who are working with scholars from Oklahoma State University and West Texas A&M in Canyon, outside Amarillo, under the sponsorship of the National Geographic Society. They divided Texas into 116 squares and are interviewing four native Texans spanning four age groups-- from the 20's to the 80's, in each.

As part of the latest effort, two master's students in linguistics from the University of North Texas at Denton, Amanda Aguilar, 24, and Brooke Earheardt, 23, arranged recently to record Mr. Greer, 70, as he responded to an exhaustive 31-page questionnaire.

Ms. Aguilar first probed some of Mr. Greer's attitudes toward Texas. Was it a barren state?

""It's in the ahs of the beholder,"" responded Mr. Greer, who was born in Port Arthur. The state, he said, was ""dee-vahded, you kin almost draw a lahn.""

Was it a progressive state?

""Compared to who?"" he said. ""Califohnia? Baghdad? Ah'd have to say Texas is a progressive state.""

Distinctive?

""Most are distinctive in their own way,"" he said, smiling, ""with the possible exception of Ah-wah."" (That was Iowa.)

Next Ms. Aguilar quizzed Mr. Greer on a lexicon of Texas words and phrases. Had he ever heard the expression ""y'all?""

Of course. ""Ah think 'you' sometimes just duddn't work bah itself.""

Could you use it for just one person?

""Ah would trah to confahn it to the plural,"" he said. ""It's just like 'youse guys.' ""

Had he heard ""fixin' to?""

Of course again. "" 'Ahma' often goes with it,"" he said. ""Ahma fixin' to go.""

The questions and Mr. Greer's answers kept coming. A dragonfly? That's a ""miskeeta hahk."" A wishbone was a ""pulleybone."" A cowboy's rope was a lasso or a lariat, or just a ""ropin' rope."" A drought was worse than a ""drah spell""; no rain, or ""it haddn for a long tahm."" You wait ""for"" a friend who haddn shown up, but you wait ""on"" someone who is nearby and delayed, perhaps upstairs putting on makeup.

Afterward, Ms. Aguilar and Ms. Earheardt said that Mr. Greer, though white, employed some noticeable African-American and Deep South speech patterns. There were also Spanish influences, common in Texas, where Spanish was widely spoken for nearly a hundred years before English.

Dr. Tillery and Dr. Bailey warned that it was possible to exaggerate the distinctiveness of Texas English because the state loomed so large in the popular imagination. Few speech elements here do not also appear elsewhere.

""Nevertheless,"" they wrote in their paper on Texas English, ""in its mix of elements both from various dialects of English and from other languages, TXE is in fact somewhat different from other closely related varieties.""

Perhaps the most striking finding, Dr. Tillery said, was the spread of the humble ""y'all,"" ubiquitous in Texas as throughout the South. Y'all, once ""you all"" but now commonly reduced to a single word, sometimes even spelled ""yall,"" is taking the country by storm, the couple reported in an article written with Tom Wikle of Oklahoma State University and published in 2000 in the Journal of English Linguistics. No one other word, it turns out, can do the job.

""Y'all"" and ""fixin' to"" were also spreading fast among newcomers within the state, they said, particularly those who regard Texas fondly. Use of the flat 'I,' they found, also correlated strikingly to a favorable view of Texas.

But they found some curious anomalies, as well.

One traditional feature of Texas and Southern speech -- pronouncing the word ""pen"" like ""pin,"" known as the pen/pin merger -- is disappearing in the big Texas cities, while remaining common in rural areas, Dr. Tillery said. Texans in the prairie may shell out ""tin cints,"" but not their metropolitan brethren.

Urban Texas is abandoning the ""y"" sound after ""n,"" ""d"" and ""t,"" exchanging dipthongs for monophthongs. So folks in the cities read a ""noospaper"" -- what their rural counterparts call a ""nyewspaper."" They'll hum a ""tyewn"" on the range, a ""toon"" in Houston. The upgliding dipthong, too, is an endangered species in the cities, where a country ""dawg"" is just a dog.

Why city Texans, more than country folk, should disdain to write with a ""pin"" is not clear, although it seems that some pronunciations carry a stigma of unsophistication while others do not.

It was such mixed patterns that suggested the emergence of a new dialect on the West Texas plains, Dr. Tillery said.

Other idiosyncrasies have all but vanished over time. Texans for the most part no longer pray to the ""Lard,"" replacing the ""o"" with an ""a,"" or ""warsh"" their clothes. How the interloping ""r"" crept in remains an especially intriguing question, Dr. Bailey said. Trying to trace the peculiarity, he asked Texans to name the capital of the United States, often drawing the unhelpful answer ""Austin.""

The opposite syndrome, known as r-lessness, which renders ""four"" as ""foah"" in Texas and elsewhere, is easier to trace, Dr. Bailey said. In the early days of the republic, plantation owners sent their children to England for schooling. ""They came back without the 'r,' "" he said.

""The parents were saying, listen to this, this is something we have to have, so we'll all become r-less,"" he said. The craze went down the East Coast from Boston to Virginia (skipping Philadelphia, for some reason) and migrating selectively around the country.

Other common Texas locutions that replace an ""s"" with a ""d"" -- ""bidness"" for ""business,"" ""waddn"" for ""wasn't"" -- are simply matters of mechanical efficiency, Dr. Bailey said. ""With 'n' and 'd' the tongue stays in the same position,"" he said. ""It's ease of articulation.""

So even ""fixin' to"" becomes ""fidden to"" or ""fith'n to."" And fixin' to -- where did that come from, anyway?

""Who knows?"" Dr. Bailey said.</lj-cut>"

"event","I can't believe that they're making a movie out of another Disneyland ride (Pirates was first). And it has Eddie Murphy in it. 

I dread ever going back to Disneyland again. The magic of individual shops with strange objects that could not be found anywhere else will be completely gone, replaced with racks and racks of sweatshirts of Eddie Murphy's face. No more perfume shops in New Orleans Square, the special fritters that they only had in one place, or those hott fedoras at the shop near the Jungle Cruise. I know that progress has to be made, and sometimes it can make a Disneyland ride better. Like when FedEx took over sponsership of Space Mountain -- it actually became a funnier, more fully realized ride, believe it or not (though the hot blue and orange polyester jumpsuits worn by employees were replaced by boring black outfits).

But this movie may be the final nail in the coffin. Disneyland will soon be one big Disney store, and the only place you'll only be able to buy a mouse-ears hat with your name stiched on the back is on eBay."

"event","So on Friday, there was a suicide in Bobst Library, the main library up here.

It was a college freshman. He jumped from the 10th floor.

The library is twelve stories high, and features a huge atrium that goes up to the 12th floor.

It is very sad and creepy. What's even worse is that exactly one month earlier, ANOTHER NYU student killed himself in the exact same way. Tenth floor, library.

When they fell, they fell into the middle of the main lobby where lots of people are milling around, waiting for elevators, checking out books, etc. It's pretty amazing that they didn't take anyone else out with them.

They now have security guards around all of the balconies (which they put into place right after number one). Also, after the second one, you are no longer allowed to get anywhere near the edge of the railing above the second floor. There are also guards on the elevators.

And they are in the process of enclosing the balconies in plexiglass.

These are the first incidents of suicide in the library.

This weekend, I'm going to CA for Sarah's memorial service. I have no idea what it will entail, but I am thinking that it will be an important step to be around a lot of people who knew her. Also, I get to see old friends all weekend, which will be great."

"event","So I found out last night that an old friend of mine died. She was 29 years old. She had cancer. It had spread so much by the time they found it that they don't even know what kind of cancer it was. She was alive for five days after they found it.

I'm incredibly sad and numb and hurt. But I am really angry. Because there was no reason that she shouldn't be alive. She was a beautiful, fucking smart girl with the strongest will of anyone I've ever met. She owned every room she ever walked into. She was always the center of attention, but it was OK because she was not someone you hated for it. 

But I am telling all of you this not to get sympathy, but to inform you. I am going to get a physical and go to the gyno this month. She put off going to the doctor, because like a lot of us, she thought that the pain would go away on its own, and that it was related to stress or somehting else and she didn't want to go to the doctor. It wasn't, and now she's dead.

Please go get checkups. Now. Make the appointment todday. I don't know if she'd necessarily be alive if she had, but maybe she would and that's enough for me. I feel like shit, and I can't imagine how her family is doing. I have been making all of these phone calls, and it's all just really fucking wrong. She should not be dead. 

Please, please go to the doctor."

If I don't, then I have to be revaccinated. They said that it often happens that people lose their immunity over the years.

Otherwise, I can be vaccinated tomorrow morning for $50.

Do I take the wait-and-see approach? The other bummer: I can't register for classes til I get the go ahead from the vaccine folks.

It is a very irritating development, as I have to somehow prove that I have gotten my MMR vaccine before school starts in a few weeks. I have a record from many years ago, however it was deemed useless by the health center staff when it was discovered to be unsigned by a physician.

So...my question is: it looks as though I might have to be revaccinated. I am trying to find information about adverse side effects on the web, but have been unable to find any.

Does anyone have antecdotal evidence about whether or not this shot could be harmful to a person's health? I am beginning to be very afraid of what will happen to me if I get revaccinated, though I don't have any hard evidence to support it."

Yesterday, I was on the subway when the electricity went out. I was down there for about two hours. After a lot of confusion, and being told that ""women and children first"" needed to go to one end of the train to evacuate through the tunnel, it turns out that the train was actually right next to an emergency exit that opened up onto Bleeker and West 6th. So we ended up climbing out of this exit, helped up by firemen, into a crowd of onlookers.

People were starting to panic down there. All of us just wanted to get off the train, but some of us were a bit more forceful about it than others. Even one of the conductors started to panic. There was a sad group of day camp kids who looked very shaken. It was hot, there was no air to breathe. 

I made friends with a very nice woman, as well as these lost German kids who had been in New York for two hours. The nice woman and I went to this place at Canal and West Broadway where her boyfriend's band was supposed to play last night. That clearly didn't happen. And he had a truck, so we were thinking that they could give me a ride home. Kidz, there has been almost no gridlock like the gridlock I saw last night. Anyhow, when we got down there, they decided, rightly, to abandon the truck, and I walked home.

A friend of mine was supposed to stay with me last night, but I didn't hear the doorbell ring because it was...that's right...run by electricity. I still haven't been able to find him, and am very nervous that he turned out OK. I wasn't sure if he had even made it in.

At least I found out that I am not claustrophobic. I thought I had those tendencies, but if there was ever a time for that to come out, it was then. And it didn't.

And thank you for the cute message! I got it this morning, when I used a payphone. My phone still isn't working. If all goes well, it should very shortly.

Another weird thought: as I was getting onto the subway, I started thinking about what a  Law and Order episode would look like if I were the victim of foul play. I pictured Baby's father going around, asking people about me, going by what they found in my wallet. I'm going to try not to have those thoughts ever again as I go into the subway, as they do seem to haunt all too well."

"event","I am melencholy tonight. There is something about the second-to-last night in a town that gets your proverbial goat. It's far worse than the last night. It's the anticipation of what isn't ever going to happen that makes one, well, fucking sad.

So, there it is. I'm sad. I'm sad because I'm leaving and I thought I wouldn't be sad and I am.

I'm sorry I missed Fort Reno last night. I'm sorry I missed the Galaxy Hut tonight. It all couldn't be helped, and I apologize.

I will miss you all. A lot. And I've said that to most people, but to the folks I haven't, I really will.

It's not that I'm going that far away or that I won't be down here every month. But it's still mind-numbing and sad and I can't really picture what my life will be like shortly.

My nephews are asleep and I have to join them.

And I can't write at all tonight. Not that I ever could, here, but I am trying to like a normal person right now and just can't get it together. But it's awkward having untold numbers of people you don't know staring at a screen that you're writing to a few people who you just want to give simple, uncomplicated outlines of your life to. Livejournal may be one of the worst things I ever participated in, in some ways.

But good night all. I love you more than you know. And thanks for showing up, it meant a lot."

"event","I found an apartment!

It's in Williamsburg. It's a block from the L train, Graham Ave stop. It's gonna take me under half an hour door to door to go to school. The train ride is about 12 minutes.

It's a real one bedroom, and I can afford it.

The neighborhood is cute. It seems to be mostly old Italians hanging around in front of stores.

I am happy. 

Now you guys can start thinking about coming to visit! I've got the space..."

"event","Hi all,

As a delightful addendum to my move to New York in August, I just found out that I need to sublet my apartment for the months of August and September. If you or anyone you know is looking, let me know. Here's the deal:

Available around August 1 (negotiable)

Small studio on 16th between Q and Corcoran.

It's $800. Hardwood floors, high ceilings. Large closet. It has a small kitchen and small but servicable living area. Coin operated laundry in the building. And a Pepsi machine!

Honestly, the best thing about this place is its location. It's 1 block to the goods on 17th street, 2 blocks from two different grocery stores (Safeway, Fresh Fields), 4 blocks to Black Cat or Adams Morgan, and convenient to every Metro line except yellow.

You are free to take over the lease when it ends September 30.

You have to pay gas, which is about $8 a month.  The building is wired for Starpower, which rocks. Management has been fine -- neither great nor terrible. The super will be living on the same floor as you: a bonus when you get locked out.

Also -- I can be negotiable on move-in date, as well as leaving you some key pieces of furniture if you want 'em. Like a bed and some dishes.

Please feel free to forward around, and have folks contact me at:

emily@newcolumbia.net



Danke."

I really don't like livejournal today. I'm thinking about leaving and deleting it all. Not that I post here much, but you know what I mean.

I don't know from what my crankiness stems, but 'Six Feet Under' was really fucking depressing last night. Watching fictional trainwreck relationships unfold is less and less appealing the closer to home it all hits. I am old.

I have to go run errands that I should have done hours ago. Fuck."

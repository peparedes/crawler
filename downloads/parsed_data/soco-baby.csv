"event","<P><FONT size=2>okay so originally my mom was not going to let me go to warped tour but then through my dad i guess she decided i could go!! so ivan drove down and i drove us to hershey park lol it was tres fun we watched some really really cute old guy paint while we were sitting at a gas station haha i was scared he was going to fall off the ladder!!&nbsp; so we get to the park at like 1215 and get our tickets and look for a schedule of when the bands go on..&nbsp;and billy talent was playing .. then ivan sees a sign that said allister.. main stage 12 so we ran around looking for allister&nbsp;but missed them by like 2 minutes cuz then the casualties came on&nbsp;- now they have huge mowhawks and spikey, colorful hair.. it was kind of scary.. and they kept saying.. ""all you fuckers in the back better get into this shit"" - i was really upset that we didnt get to&nbsp;see allister but then we found the big schedule board and finally figured everything out and watched matchbook romance who were really good but not amazing and the guy from the matches came and sang&nbsp;with them&nbsp;.. the main stage was split in 2 so while matchbook romance was on .. sugarcult was setting up and then we watched sugarcult who also liked to say fuck a lot .. actually all of the bands did.. and sugarcult was good they played a few good songs.. like daddy's little defect and of course memory and bouncing off the walls .. and she is the blade.. then we were going to go see the letter kills but we got hungry lol so we got food and then at 245 the matches were on one of the&nbsp;side stages and we got there at like 235 so we watched a little bit of rufio who was pretty good .. then the matches came on and we were really close and it was so loud but the guitarist with the huge blonde afro threw his guitar pick and i got it!!! i was so happy! hahaha the guy from the matches was kind of queer and the blonde guy sung a lot more than normal but they were still pretty good live.. and then at 3 we ran to the mainstage to see taking back sunday which was okay live and they played crappy songs off the new cd but they played cute with out the e, cut from the team so that was good ! then... YELLOWCARD!! at 330!! we got really close.. some guy helped us shove through .. then it got extremely hot and we had to back out .. yellowcard was amazing and played good songs and they were cute .. especially the violin guy!! and then at 4 we left to go to KELSEY'S HOUSE!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>now.. i drove to kelsey's house.. thanks to her wonderful directions in which she did not get us lost!!&nbsp; (fruitville pike - kelsey; whatville pike? - me; fruitville -kelsey; spell it - me; f-r-u-i-t -kelsey; fruit? like a banana -me; yes kelly - kelsey; OHHH! - me) hahahahahha that was so funny - then i got to see my kelsey!! and i noticed first thing that she had CORN in her backyard!! it was fun stuff.. then aly came and she was in her bathing suit so she changed but took like 20 years.. and then we had a HA meeting and went to panera bread (ivan was discluded from any such HA meeting).. then ivan and i had to go cuz we had to get back to warped to see <STRONG>FALL OUT BOY </STRONG>.. so ivan drives back and FOB goes on at 710 and we get to the mainstage at 710 exactly.. and fall out boy isnt on!! it's some gay band that i've never heard of.. and so we ask someone else and they said it was blah dee blah and flogging molly was on next.. so we went shit and went to the side stages where we found FOB!!! and oh god were they good.. i am in love with pete and chris..&nbsp;and i am going to see them again with TBS and matchbook romance on Dec 27th.. i've decided that now!!&nbsp;that was my big adventure yesterday!! haha and what a great one it was ;D</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>after a lot of events last night .. i sat down and watched zoolander.. yes thats right.. i found my dvd finally!&nbsp; giselle had it that little ho lol jk.&nbsp; so i watched that then fell asleep and woke up at 630! on a saturday! and had to rush around (with my mom like up my ass half the time) trying to get ready for my tennis tournament up in wayne, pa (near king of prussia).&nbsp; so we are all in the car (my mom, sister and i) and we are doing fine until we have to actually find the exit and road.. so we used our little gps system that got us to some dead end road w.the same name (later to find out it was right behind it but the gps didnt know that) so i was late for my 8 am match! but we finally got there and the girl was nice i guess.. her name was sarah stentor (which we just learned is a protist under the phylum ciliophora in bio - stentor that is!!) and i lost cuz i played like shit but its only a warm up match.. but the people next to me were hilariousssssssss omg they were both such bitches!! the one girl (1) called the others out (2) and 2 disagreed w. 1's call.&nbsp; so 2 comes up to the net and was like ""are you crazy that ball was completely in!"" and 2 was like ""umm its my call and it was out"" and then 2 was like SHOW ME THE MARK (cuz you can check marks on clay courts) and&nbsp;1 was like idk where it landed it was like a minute ago!! and they argued for liek 5 minutes then the ref came over and they sorted their issues out.. but 2 kept grunting when she hit the ball .. but she kept saying ""EYE"" or ""AYE"" or ""I"" lol im not sure what she was doing but thats what it sounded like.. and i was getting really pissed off... and then i saw them change for sets and 2 whips out this little folding chair and sits in it and i was like wtf?! and then she turned her back to her opponent and sat w. her arms crossed lol i was like wow.. then i lost .. haha so i went to watch jenna's match and the little 10 year old girl she was playing was good but a COMPLETE BITCH!! every shot she thought jenna didnt call well she would go.. WHERES THE MARK! and they were clearly out shots.. and its not like she needed it she beat my sister 6-0 6-0 which means that jenna didnt even get a game on her.. and one time jenna called a ball out that was completely out and she said wheres the mark and you could tell jenna was pissed.. so she was like RIGHT HERE and the girl accused her of making it w.her racket.. i was like are you serious? and i turned over to my&nbsp;mom and was like jenna's probably like ill give you a mark bitch .. right inbetween your eyes and my mom like died haha and the next shot jennas was in and she called it out.. and jenna just to be a bitch lol was like wheres the mark!! it was good... then she lost too and then my mom took us to king of prussia and i got soo much cute stuff from hollister and abercrombie.. im in LOVE! then i came home and had to do mad chores.. but theyre all done and now i have to babysit and that was my long and stressful day!!</FONT></P>

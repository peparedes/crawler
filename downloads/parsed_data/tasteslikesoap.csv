"event","I was going to post this on my tumblr due to the fact that it's my main source of blogging but I'm afraid that's too public. We've been talking nonstop since you left despite the fact that you told me whatever it was that we had was over.
I was used to the idea of that but it's beginning to become a problem. Everyday with the cute goodbyes and amazing compliments. And I was starting to get worried for me to see you in december. And then you sent me this, and I didn't have time to respond before you went to the sleep.

i haven't been with anyone since the summer, and i have had several chances (however pathetic they were) I didn't think letting it end would be a problem. When i asked you if you missed the summer, i meant did you miss us.

I miss us, I miss us so much it kills me.
Please tell me something good tomorrow morning.
I miss you, you make me so happy. I would give anything for us to be together."

"event","I spent four hours with you.
I haven't felt that much passion in a long time
I woke up with your arms around me.
You've kissed every inch of me.
You asked if you were allowed to call me
If this was just a one night thing.

The next morning I slept in your bed while you showered.
My skin covered in the smell of you, cigarettes, alcohol and sweat.
It felt right, the harmless kissing 
We walked down the stairs to you car
and you grabbed my hand and smiled.

The ride to work was rushed,
you scolded me in the car.
'You'll be late to work' you say.
I wasn't allowed to tease you anymore.

Before I left the car you kissed me softly
I smiled. 


You kissed my arm.
You kissed my neck.
You kissed my lips.
You kissed my stomach.
You kissed my legs.
You kissed my everything.

But I know you won't call."

Hi Pete,
I like it when you throw woodchips at my window.
I'm sorry I'm dwelling.
I love you
-Kimi

That was from the summer when he slept over one night. He was throwing woodchips at my windows and smoking a cigarette and asked me to write a note to him and throw it out the window.
That was when I read a text message conversation with him and margaret
saying that he missed her sometimes. He never knew I read it.
I probably should have let go then.

I threw it out, and didn't feel any heart retching feeling.
Maybe 'cuz it's not him I miss.
But I really do miss having someone around for me.

Artist's Residence was too hospital like for me.

I like it there, a lot.
I like that they leave their doors open.
And I like that everyone knows everyone.
It's the college experience I wanted at Hartford but never got.
If I don't get in, I'm going to be so upset.
You don't even know.


SUBJECT CHANGE.
Taking the commuter rail for the first time since summer was very hard for me.
I was surprised at how hard it was for me.
There was a point in time where I thought about you every minute, then every hour, then every week, then once a month, then once every couple of months.
It's been a while since I missed you, but I don't think I actually missed you, I just missed having someone.

YES&nbsp;MAJASCULES&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;NECESSARY.

For those of you that were not aware i was in cape cod with shannon this past week.
we did an abundance of things, like swimming and bike riding and puzzling and other normal summer house esque activities.
and then we did the awesome things.

We met up with Pete in Wellfleet a bunch of times and it was really nice because not seeing him for long periods of time is hard on me.
While with pete I went to my first water park, I&nbsp;went to my first drive in movie, i had my first choco taco and oatmeal cookie whoopie pie and I went on my first motorbike ride. We tend to do things i've never done before together, it's really nice.
We also had sleepovers and took a hot tub together - jacuzzi (:

Then there was that one night with margarita's , too much wine, lots of tequila shots, getting taught the 'proper' way to take tequila shots, going swimming in our undies, and being sloptarded with adults. 
Sometimes being drunk with parents is just more fun. hahahah

this week was fun. and i hope the rest of my summer is just as good (:

now my family is hosting a wine tasting - ballin'

"event","twitter is like crack,
but my uncle found me on it - and i have no idea how 'cuz the link isn't posted anywhere.
so that freaks me out a little bit.
plus he is only following me, so i think he got it 'cuz i have it
and that is scary. in a way. 'cuz we aren't really close.

other news:
- thanksgiving was nice, turkey made me tired. family time was lovely
- we got our christmas tree today. &amp; it hailed.
- winter is coming i guess
- johnny drama was here for a while, which was nice 'cuz we haven't hung out in a while
- stuff between us is still weird, but i doubt it will ever be normal.
- i have work tommorow, which sucks &amp;&nbsp;a parade on sunday.
- this vacation is over for me, and i haven't done anything.

i CANNOT wait 'till christmas break.
goooodday.

This will cause the world to slaughter a sacred calf to appease the gods,      paralyzed by your arrival. Who is this nightmare beyond comprehension? Where did they come from? And why      do they look so good as a brain in a jar?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Stage Two</h3>     <p>Next, you must vaporize the internet. This will all be done from a amusement park, a      mysterious place of unrivaled dark glory.  Upon seeing this, the world will spontaneously combust,      as countless hordes of winged monkeys hasten to do your every bidding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Stage Three</h3>     <p>Finally, you must tauntingly wave your needlessly big weather machine, bringing about an end to sanity. Your name shall become synonymous with the spice girls, and no man will ever again dare make you clean your room. Everyone will bow before your mind-boggling insanity, and the world will have no choice but to lavish endless praise on your misdeeds.</p></blockquote>"

i really don't want to. i want to sit and think about everything.
i made a bad choice last night, i don't know if i should tell anyone 'cuz i know they will just be disappointed in me.
the cycle i finally got out of , i'm getting back into. i'm not sure how to deal with it.
because it makes me happy, it makes me, me. it's not smart.
i know every single one of my friends will hate me if i told them.

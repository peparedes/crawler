"event","you know what i had for lunch?  go on you gymnastic gnat, fucking guess.  if you guessed ""vita-wheat, which is an all-natural crispbread, containing over 85% whole wheat grains and the benefits of sunola oil, a monounsaturated  oil"", you would have been very close.  it's actually called vita-<b>weat</b>.  apparently the H isn't worth a mention.  i had 4 pieces of that, and two glasses of water.  i am the very fucking model of health these days, and i've lost 8kg.  that's about 17 pounds for you children of the old world.  don't tell anyone about the glass of coke i had last night...

last year, i'd expressed an interest in getting a drawing tablet to aid my digital art.  at the time, i'd only considered using it for cartooning, and when my interest in cartooning dropped off, so did my interest in a tablet.  it has occurred to me recently however, that it'd be a good idea to have one for my tshirt designs.  some of the designs ive had ideas for and sketched out on paper would be exceptionally hard to transfer to a nice clean vector format (something streamline sure as fuckity don't offer).  other than using flash 5 to convert bitmaps to vector, a tablet is the way to go.  

SO, i'm looking at an <a href=""http://www.wacom.com/productinfo/intuos.cfm"">intuos2</a>.  it appears to be <b>the shit4</b>.  good price too.  so if one of you germanic warriors of love wants to get me one for my birthday, HAHA FEEL FREE.

<quote>So, say you were meeting a new person--blind date, new friend, who knows. And you wanted them to have some idea of what kind of person you are, and who you are. But you can't actually tell them in so many words. Instead, you have to give them a box, with a dozen things in it for them to look at/read/listen to/taste/whatever. What would you put in the box? And a copy of your journal or a link to your LJ would be the same thing as just telling them directly, yourself, so that's not allowed.</quote>

"event","i have a history of taking stupid risks.  am i doing that again?  jury's out.

so anyway, i let a bus pull me up a hill tonight, while out riding my bike.  i'd just ridden up that same hill 7 times, for exercise, and decided that the 8th time would be a handy occasion to make use of a slowly passing bus.  grabbed onto it's engine hood handle on the back, and did my Marty McFly impersonation.  except i wasn't on a skateboard, and i wasn't being pulled by a pickup.  well, you get the idea.  WHAT A DANGERMAN.  

i was offered half a packet of crisps today, and i turned it down.  watching my diet you see.  fairly proud of that effort, yes sir.  yeah well.. whoopty frickin do!"

"event","incubus are playing melbourne on the 21st of march.  that's excellent news.

also, i pre-ordered their new album last night, at my local music store.  probably didn't need to, but i'd rather be safe than sorry.  

i don't feel like ironing my shirt today.. do you think they'd notice?  i rolled my sleeves up last night, they're gonna be all creased.. *sigh*"

"event","i wonder what it's like to know you're important.
i wonder what it's be like to make a stand.
i wonder who'd notice if i went and took a shot.

i wonder who'd notice if i just threw away all i've got."

"event","i was thinking just now, maybe all it takes to have a meaningful and worthwhile life is when more than 3 days out of a 7 day week actually make some fucking sense, you know?  

i need to throw myself into my clothing company, from a money perspective.  i've got designs that i'm happy with, i know where i can get shirts from, and i have a reasonable idea of where and how i'm going to get the printing done.  shit, even more surprising to me is that even though there's 4 million tshirt companies going around melbourne right now, i'm still convinced that my gear will sell.  i'm not entirely sure why i believe that, and maybe it'd be sensible to do some proper fucking research, but i really feel like i can do this.

mind you, sometimes it feels like i'm just foolin.  i go into one store, and i see 30 different brands toutin their shit, and i go into another store and i see another completely different group of 30 brands toutin <b>their</b> shit.  even if i <b>can</b> get up the money to print my gear, how the fuck can i possibly expect to make a living from it?  how can i expect to become financially secure?  i'm avoiding life's responsibities and requirements and suggested avenues to success by chasing this dream, and if it fucks up, <b>i'm fucked</b>.  i'll be without a business, without a foreseeable future, and most definitely minus one girlfriend.  i spose that's the risk of business huh.  yeah.

i also have no idea how the shit i'm supposed to do any of this if i'm travelling all the time.  lili doesn't think she's going to be able to get time off work to come visit me, and to be honest, i don't want her to have to try.  it's easier for me to find a job than it is for a fulltime student in new york city, so i dont want her risking her position there.  hence, i feel like i'm the only one in a position to make the trip.  that said, if i go to new york, it's 7 months worth of money saving - and time - that could have been spent on my shirts.  all to be in the presence of an amazing person for one or two months if i'm lucky.  you can see the constant decision that tries to force itself into my head everyday.  stay and do what's technically right, or go with your heart and be with the one you love.  YEEEAH THANKS LIFE FOR BEING SO SUPER.  so fucking super in fact, that i feel like a cement-filled bowling ball to the head would be less painful than my day to day mental routine right now.

decisions, decisions, decisions."

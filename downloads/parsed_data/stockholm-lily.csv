"event","so fuck it, i am deleting this thing
i have actually decided to give up right here and go live the rest of my life without this shit. i am happily married, and going to tafe and going back to uni, and i am buying my own house, and just going to be happy. and you know what, the more i think about that the more happy i am. i'm actually going to take hold of the bright future and actually strive for it. and fuck everyone else. 
what i thought was important now isn't worth it.
all i have to say is:
i am sorry if i offended any of you by stuff that i have said in the past. i didn't mean to, i am just blunt and actually believe everyone is entittled to their own opinion and i'll excersise my right to it. just like  the rest of you.
later"

"event","i am blank at the moment.
 i really feel like updating, but at the moment...
it's supprising how little people actually give a shit when it comes right down to it. but then i have given up on giving a shit even more so cos i'm angry.
on a completely different note, why do my dreams involve the cast of characters of the lion king when it's a nightmare?
i'm actually going through a few massive changes at the moment. feeling strange having not spoken to anyone but kelv for a week, other than the obligatory work ""conversations"". maybe if i withdraw enough then i can become like that clea duvall character in buffy, the invisible chick, and then i'll get to be in the cia as an invisible person. but do they really lecture out of text books?
the car is working for some reason, thank fuck, i have friday and saturday and sunday off, so i am going to stay in my room and bed the whole time i think. kelv will be at work so i will be alone, not a lot of point to getting up really. except to feed the cats, because i am a cat lady. i miss kerrilee and ashlee heaps, and it kinda fucks me off that i don't get to see my two best friends at the moment, because a)ashlee is in india and b) kerrilee has uni and dain and on top of that i work mornings and she works heaps at night. the fact neither of us actually has any sort of reliable car to get between plympton and belair also affects that
i'm heaps rambling on. if anyone has picures of our wedding that i can get copies of it would be very much appriciated, as we actually don't have any pictures as of yet.
relatives suck.
i think i may be tired, and really really sore. i want the hot to stop... please let it stop
 love from and accidentally emo chick.... oh fuck now i ave ""accidently kelly street"" in my head..."

"event","hey, so, it's lucy. i have a new journal, though i'm not sure why. i think i just felt like a change. i really can't be fucked updating very much. going to tafe and it's ok, but i actually wouldn't mind going back to uni eventually. i have a bad cold from getting soaked yesterday and i have assignments due. it's been so long since i have had to do an assignment. i should probably do atleast some..."

"event","Don't you hate it when you come to a moment in your life where you realize that you just lost a dear friend?  And you knew it was happening, but you tried to convince yourself that it wasn't?  I mean, I guess it's the same way with relationships.  Sometimes.  But no, this had to be a friend...someone you would have stuck by...someone you thought would stick by you.  And then it doesn't happen.  And the disappointment is insanely hard to bear.

I was patient...understanding...kind.  I was much more so with this particular friend than anyone else.  When second chances turn into third, and when third chances turn into fourth chances, it is more than a pattern, it is a heartbreak.

And this is why I'm sad tonight.  I guess we all have lessons to learn."

"event","It's not that I really want to write in this thing, but I feel like since I have it, I should update once in awhile.  See, the thing is this:  I usually tell the people I want to tell about what's going on in my life, and others most likely don't give a shit either way.  So I guess I write letters to myself whenever i write in this.

Oh well, it's 5:30 in the morning and I figure that it's dumb for me to go to bed now.  I mean, I might as well begin my homework, right?

I did a lot today, despite staying in my pajamas all day.  I fixed my mail program, I cleaned the whole house...especially my room, I sent two boxes out, I sent Congresswoman Schmidt a letter (yeah, it was a bit hostile, but diplomatic as possible), and I emailed the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf about volunteering there.

So the house is pretty clean...I'm proud of that.  I really put a dent in my room.  It was a mess.  Disgusting.  Now it's not so much.  Once the term is over, i'll have more room because these books will all go away.  You know...All three of them.

I sent two boxes to the Apple Store.  Hopefully about 160 bucks will be added back on to my parent's credit card.  I'm an idiot.

Schmidt sent out an email to me.  I get them occasionally.  She said that if we pull out of iraq that our allies will see us as weak and unreliable.  Well, I certainly had something to say about that.  I'm not a great political mind, I admit, but I can see when there's something really wrong going on.  I think I have made the transition to Democrat...fully.  Not that I have much other choice.  I mean...I think it's wrong that we have only two political parties and majority takes all.  <b><i>""Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual)."" --Ayn Rand </i></b>

I simply reminded Schmidt of this and told her that whatever pride she believes we would lose as a result of pulling our troops out of iraq is well worth saving the lives of men and women my age.  I told her that I was an individual, and my views were not being relayed by her in any way.  I had been dying to write a letter lately to someone.  I wanted to take my anger out on someone.  Why not the idiot that made a complete ass out of herself a few weeks ago?

And then I sent an email to the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf.  I asked to volunteer my time there and to get involved in the Deaf community again.  I don't know why...I just really felt the urge to do something with myself.  I want to volunteer my time while i can.  While I still have enough financial support from mum and dad to do this sort of thing.

So I was angry and charitable all in one night.  Yeah, I think I've made progress.

This week has been the most stressful of my life.  I have three classes to study for/write essays for/draw a final for.  All due monday.  I'm coming home tuesday.  It couldn't come soon enough."

"event","Somehow the hospital keeps haunting me.  I was in last week again for the someteenth time.  I absolutely hate how doctors make me feel.  They do this thing where they look at you as if you're not a person...like what you're going through might be painful, but they are so aloof to that.  They don't care how much it hurts because there's nothing they can do and you're just taking up a bed.  

That's what really sets me off.  They can't do anything for me as if it's my fault that I have a rare disorder that they can't comprehend.  I'm not real because they've never seen anything like what I have before.  It's my fault.  

And coming back to school and going to classes is very difficult.  I feel like my brains are squashed from all of this medication I'm on.  My body is like a wet noodle.  My eyes are out of focus.  I'm tired as hell.  And all I do is cry.  Because people keep talking to me about the possibility of going home for a term.  Taking a term off.  Or something.

No way I can do that!  I signed up to be a college student, not some hospitalized patient!  I came to Philadelphia to learn.  I came to Drexel to do well.  And just leaving?  How much will that solve?  Maybe I'll get my crying down to an hour or two a day, but I'll be detatching myself from my LIFE.  I can't just walk away from my life.  I don't know how anyone expects me to do that.  

At the same time though, I can't keep going on like this.  Crying, feeling out of it, not sleeping, being irritated at everything, closing myself off from the world socially.  I can't find something to make me happy anymore.  

A year ago, my life was completely different.  I had just started a new relationship, I was making a ton of friends, I was doing well in my classes, I was in the school play, I hadn't gone to the hospital yet.  I remember waking up every morning and really saying to myself how lucky I was to have such I life.  I really did.  I was happier than I had ever been before.  And now, I don't have time for romance.   My friends have somewhat plateaued and dropped off.  I'm behind in classes from last year and this term.  I don't have time or energy for school plays.  And I keep ending up in hospitals being just...miserable.

My mum is coming tomorrow.  I have a doctor's appointment on wednesday.  Hopefully that will help me a little.  who knows.

Who knows anything anymore?"

I tried updating a few times this summer, but the damn thing never worked so I thought I'd just wait until it seemed like fate brought me back to this thing.  So here I am, fate...trying once again.

I went on a cruise with Caryn...it was so much fun.  It was nine days, and we went to Freeport, Grand Bahama Island, Cococay Bahamas, Key West, Cozumel Mexico, and then we had to skip Port Canaveral because of hurricane Ophelia.  I had a lot of fun, and really loved meeting so many new people.  It's nice to be back at the apartment though, and I'm relaxing a bit before everyone else moves in.  It's a bit lonely, but nice at times.  I have to start studying for my finals.

I think this year will be good.  I hope it will be.  I just gotta find the right people, you know?  I gotta get the right people, and I have to sort out all of my work.  This double major thing is gonna be huge.  I hope I can tackle it.

"event","So.  Home.  Interesting.

I hate it.  I want to go back to my old life so badly.  I'm useless here.  I'm a complete fool.  I'm not doing anything.  I can't get a job because my health is not in the most stable of conditions, I can't drive for the same reason, my parents are hovering, and I'm still spasming.  

What a giant dip in my bucket this whole thing has turned out to be.

I'm freaking out about school.  I want to do the work for my classes, but can't concentrate.  I still am in an enormous amount of pain.  I still writhe on the ground whenever I get an attack.  I'm so embarrassed.

I'm doing normal things though, which I'm grateful for.  I went to Bogarts today to see Unwritten Law and Sum 41 with Chris.  Of course, not exactly my kind of music, but he asked me to go as a last resort.  Well, I had to take my medicine with me and I keep it in a little metal case.  When we were stopped by security at the door, they found the little metal case and told me i couldn't have it.  So i had to talk to all of these people about how I <i>had</i> to take it at ten oclock and the other pill was in case of an emergency.  This one guy started asking all these questions about what they're for, and I was just like ""do I really have to answer that?  I mean, don't I have a right to my own privacy?""  So he kind of backed off a bit.  And I told him that I wasn't handing this stuff out to people, but it was for my own medical safety.  So the guys just told me to bring my prescription bottle or a note the next time.

It's always nice to know when you are the most intelligent person in a room.  It's a good feeling.  Anyway, they let me have my little metal case and my medicine.  What drama.

I miss people from philly.  I miss Emily, Tom, Dave, Mama, Keri, Vinny, Alice, Priya, Kelly, AJ, Mary, Indy, Caryn, Chandler, Ryan, Dan, Deniz, Othello...and of course, Adam.  I know the distance will help me get over him, I know this...but I'm still so insanely in love with him that I wish there could be another way.  But of course, we had always said that we'd split at this point anyway.  So I guess I'll just have to swallow this at some point and move on.

Love hurts."

Not even a last trip to the Sev.  We'll be packing up most of my stuff today.  I hate this.

"event","So I ended up in the hospital again.  Bummer.  My freshman year has turned out to be one big party.  Except that it's been in an in intensive care unit between the hours of 6:30 and 8 or something like that.  It was for the same thing as the last time.  Unfortunately, the doctors still can't fix me and aren't exactly sure what's wrong with me.  Whatever.  Another medical mystery to add to the list.  Not that I'm being bitter or pessimistic.  That's just not my style.

I'm trying to move on with my life, though, but it is hard to just pick up and move on after being through such horrifying events as hallucinating about little albino children covered in blood.  It's hard to sleep with such images in my head.  It's generally just hard to sleep.  It's hard.  I'm not gonna lie.  My life is not exactly easy right now.  I'll have to spend the summer doing makeup work.  I missed two midterms and I have to make one up tomorrow.  I'm stressed out.  But I'm working on it.  I'm trying.  I honestly am.  Who knows what will help me though.  I'm trying to write everything down in my journal, I'm seeing a counselor, I am trying to talk to my friends about it, but there is still just this kind of dark cloud hanging over my head with a constant reminder that I'm ill.

The spasms haven't exactly stopped.  They haven't at all, actually.  But I'm taking my medicine and trying very hard not to stress myself out.

Pah.  Stress.

The season finale of the OC is on.  Marissa supposedly gets shot.  I hope she dies.  I mean, they've been toying with my emotions since last season and I keep thinking ""maybe she'll finally die!"" but she doesn't.  It's getting frustrating.  I love seth cohen and I will marry him.  Too bad I missed last week since I was in the hospital.  Bah.  Fucking hospital.  The ICU should get some TV's or something.  

I miss adam.  Not gonna lie.  It's hard right now because I feel like I need something stable and he was always there this year.  But I should stop leaning on that crutch.  I know I should.  But I still miss him and wish I could get over this faster.  Maybe the summer distance will help.  Who knows.

"event","Life is funny sometimes.  Often not funny ""ha ha"" but just funny as in...well, as in the other type of funny I suppose.  I'm feeling better lately, which surprises me of course, because I thought I could never feel better.  So Mum turned out to be right for once.

I dyed my hair.  Its a darker brownish red.  It looks nice.  I'm thinking about dying it again the same color to get it to be stronger throughout.  Parts of my hair are still a lighter brown.  But I like it.  I feel like it did something good for me.  I did something totally independent.  I just decided to do it, you know?  I didn't ask permission or anything.  Yay!  I'm more independent!  Mum flipped out though.  I think she might kill me.  It's kind of upsetting that she's so hung up on it, but you know what?  I'm not sorry that I did it.  I can only use the excuse that I'm ""young and 18"" for so long.  By the end of the summer, I'll be 19 and be expected to grow up just a little more.  19 is a scary age.  That just seems way too old.  Yet 21 doesn't sound so bad, teehee :-P

And now that I'm not with Adam, I'm hanging out with people a lot more.  Which is partially good and partially sad.  Of course a huge part of my life feels like its missing, but I'm moving on.  I am coming to realize that I have options...even if they're just hanging out with friends more.

Class today is cancelled.  I'll have to work on my script and my editing project.  I'm just so excited that even though life seems to suck sometimes, I'm still doing what I love to do and I'm learning so much about my life and about how to deal with situations.  Mary asked me yesterday what I would change about this year if I had to redo it.  At first I really couldn't think of anything that I'd want to change because I have learned so much, but I guess if I had to pick something, I'd change the way I dealt with some situations in my life.  There's that.  Maybe I would have written my english papers sooner too, that way I could have taken English 103 like a normal kid.  Yeah, i'd change that.  Maybe I wouldn't have spent so much money on people, too.  I've become very broke from buying other people shit.  Not that it's their fault...it's mine because I love buying people things.  

Yeah.  So life is funny.  Ha ha.  I guess if I can't laugh at myself I won't have much to laugh about.  I'm trying to laugh more."

People have scoffed at the fact that I'm fasting.  It really upsets me because all I really need right now is understanding and support.  Is that too much to expect?

I will remove this excess weight.  I just need to begin anew, i guess.  I'm so hurt and confused.  i don't feel like i can function.  I don't know how i'll make it through the next few months.

Since I have never fasted before, i don't want to make mistakes with this.  I do not want to overdo it, I do not want to put myself in danger, I just want to become a healthier person.

Er...I couldn't take my physics exam because I accidentally thought that it was today (monday, I mean) and it turned out to be tomorrow (tuesday) when I'm supposed to be on a plane.  So shit.  I emailed my professor and he said I could take it when I come back from break.  Grr.  I'm really not in the mood to go through this shit.  

And I can't sleep for some reason.  Adam is over and he's fast asleep, but I can't sleep.  I feel bad because I'm not in bed with him, but I figure he's really tired and he won't notice I'm gone.  This week will be rough for him.  He has a lot to do.  Poor boy.  Sometimes I worry he stretches himself too thin.

So now I'm awake and I don't really have much to do.  I've kind of cleaned my room up today so I can come home to a nice clean room.  That will be nice.  I hope I'm all packed.   I don't want to be stressed out tomorrow morning.  I just want to get ready and go.  

So I'll be home until the 26th.  If anyone is going to be around, give me a call if you still like me enough, or whatever.

So.  Finals are coming up.  Finals.  Blah.  Physics will kill me.  My shooting and lighting project will be tough as hell.  I still haven't really started it and i probably need to at some point, considering my shot list/storyboard is due tomorrow.  My playwriting class was cancelled tonight, which was kinda nice.  I'm happy.  

24 is on tonight.  Adam is coming over.  I worked with him all afternoon and was pretty productive, i suppose.  I finished capturing all of Jones' DVD clips.  I even adjusted all of the sound.  I worked a bit on the FMVD clips, too.  I only got a few finished on that, though.  The clips were pretty long.  

I submitted my script for the 48 hour film festival here at drexel.  I am very nervous about it.  I'll find out in a month whether I made it or not.  I hope I did, but who knows.  If not, I'll probably make the film anyway.  Okay, I have to prepare for 24 now."

I miss adam though.  I'll be glad to see him again.  Unfortunately, too...I didn't get any of my design homework done.  I am SUCH a slacker.  Ugh, I don't know how I'll get it all done tomorrow.  It might be an all nighter.  Who knows.  I also have to come up with an idea for my shooting and lighting final, I have to study for my physics midterm, and i have a whole bunch of other shit to do that i don't even want to mention.  So I'm a bit stressed out.

i will miss my bed.  My lovely, wonderful, big bed.  Mmmm....bed....how i love thee."

This upcoming weekend is President's day weekend.  I'm coming home!  My flight is around 3 or something.  I'm very excited to come back and see my family, my dog, Chris, and Nate.  I'll probably even stop by Katie's house.

I'm kinda upset tonight.  I don't know exactly why, but I'm a bit down in the dumps.  I might just need sleep, I guess.  I have Physics and work tomorrow.  I'll work on my 48 hour script tomorrow.  I'll probably work on my other papers too.  And my design shit.  I have a lot of design to do.  A paper to write, and thumbnail sketches to make.  Just thinking about that is making me dizzy.  I skipped out on work today.  I almost feel bad.  

blah.  sorry for never updating this thing.

"event","Hey Kids.

Sorry it took so long for me to get my act together and update this thing.  So life has been pretty busy lately and everything is going really fast.  I have midterms next week!  I also schedule my spring classes next week!  Can you believe it?  Jeez...freshman year is going by WAY too fast.  I wish it would slow down a bit.  Seems like just yesterday that I came and everything was so new and exciting and I was meeting just about anyone and everyone I could.  Now there's snow on the ground, I trudge the same path to my classes, and am pretty comfortable with a few different circles of friends.  Not a bad life, eh?

Adam and I are doing great.  The poor baby has a cold right now though, so I brought him chicken noodle soup last night.  BTW to those who I haven't talked to lately:  yes, the L-bomb has been dropped and I love it!  Or him.  I guess both, hehe.

My classes are awesome.  I'm really enjoying all of them (except physics, of course) and I'm doing pretty well.  I'm excited for next term too, although I'll still have academic classes to take (math and english) and then a second art class.  That'll be a bitch.  Yipes.  But I'll also get to take Editing and Playwriting II which will be tons of fun.  I was looking at all of my required courses online last night and realized how much work a double major really is.  It'll be hard, but I'm going to stick to it.  I might have to stay in Philly this summer to take some classes so I can fit it all in in four years.  I'll get a job somewhere around the city, and I think I might live with Olivia...she offered (or begged) me to stay over the summer to keep her company in the house.  (It's the same house Adam lives in)  But I'm not sure yet.  We'll have to see.  I'm meeting with Abrams today to get his opinion and to work out some schedule kinks and whatnot.  

Monday was awesome--I was chosen to work with this big producer guy from hollywood who is coming to philly to host a seminar on writing and pitching scripts.  He's doing a seminar at drexel and one at a hotel in the suburbs.  My job is...well...I'm not really sure yet, but I think I'm doing some publicity stuff for it, and i have to set it up and shit.  I am very excited.  I'll get paid for it too!  Yippee, hooray!

Hm.  I've run out of interesting things to say.  That's unfortunate because I am usually a very fascinating person.  No wonder i don't update this thing more often."

Physics II
Design I
Playwriting I
Shooting and Lighting
University 101
Film Comedy
DVD work for Abrams where I get credit

Design will be the most time consuming, then Playwriting and Shooting and Lighting.  

I got two boxes in the mail today.  I got my speakers, my clock, lots of food, and other knick knacks that I needed.  Oh...and the three shirts that I left at home because they were still drying when I left.

Its nice being back.  I love it here...it's been pretty warm the past few days.  It was gross today though...it rained all day.  Blech.

I'll have to apoligize to him.  He makes it a rule not to read my journal.  I dunno why, he just says they're trouble.  I agree, but I don't really take mine seriously anymore.  Nevertheless, I am dedicating this entry to my wonderful boyfriend, Adam.

Tomorrow is thursday.  Friday is New Years.  I don't have a party to go to.  I might as well stay at home and get drunk on sparkling apple juice.  Hell, maybe I'll call some people over.  I dunno.  Maybe I'll go out by myself and drive around until I come along a party.  I'll go later that way people will be too drunk to notice that they don't know me.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  

Katie, Evan, and I put together and Nsync poster today for old times' sake.  It took two hours and then we realized that we were missing one piece.  a part of chris was missing.  Oh, tragedy!  

I bought 6 DVDs this week:  Austin Powers, Aladdin, The Lion King, Mary Poppins, Spaceballs, and Garden State.  Three disney, two spoofs, and a freaking amazing movie by my hero, Zach Braff.  I want to be just like him.  When I see that movie, I feel like I need to start writing.  Just to write and never stop.  It's inspirational to me.  Something about the film is just really striking.  Enough of me drooling over a DVD.  I'm thinking that my next DVD purchase will be Se7en.  It was extremely good.  Evan is going to give me his copy of Napolean Dynamite, so I'm looking forward to having that too, of course.

I must learn how to use Motion for my Mac.  I also have a lot to learn for Final Cut Pro HD.  I haven't downloade DVD Pro yet...I figure I have some time before I'll be needing it.  I think I have to make something first, haha.  How clever I am!

It is now 2 am.  I will not be going to bed, but I will now stop writing.  Happy birthday to Adam, my dearest.  I miss him like mad and can't wait to get back to Drexel to see him!  I'm leaving for Philly early sunday morning.  Yay for early plane rides that will make me wake up at 4 in the morning!"

"event","Once upon another time, there were two amazingly sexy women named Kato and Mando.  Kato and Mando were so drop-dead i-just-want-to-eat-you-up-with-a-spoon gorgeous that they could have absolutely any man in the whole world.  So they did.  They were also very rich.  They had just bought New York City (all of it) and had refurbished the very very tippity top penthouses of the formerly known Trump Tower, now renamed fittingly to KatoMando Tower.  

One day, as they were elegantly breakfasting with their select partners of choice (worn out by the night's tower-shaking endeavors), they had an unwelcome visitor impose on their feast of muffins and french toast with raisins and powdered sugar.  The men of choice for Mando were of course George Cleeny and Ewan McGroger and Kato's were Johnny Dipp and Brad Putt (names have been changed to protect the innocent and for various political reasons).  Anywho...they were all delicately feasting when all of a sudden the large bay windows shattered under the terrible force of Kevin, Screech's robot from ""Saved By the Bell.""  Riding on top of Kevin (no sexual connotations intended) was none other than Richard ""Dick"" Belding! All six of the gorgeous celebrities/rulers of the world gasped in unison.  What on earth could Mr. Belding want and why was he out for revenge?

""I am here, Dick Belding!  I am out for revenge on you, Kato and Mando because I was previously banished to South America for no apparent reason at all where i was sentenced to ten years of listening to that awful backstreet boy, nick carter with the pathetic dance moves and annoying whiny voice.  But he died by that tribe of cannibalistic midgets after falling into the sharp and jagged rocks from falling down a deep crevass after being chased wildly through the dense forest by a fleet of flesh-eating hermit crabs.  Anyway,"" he said with a giggle, ""I am here with this newly renovated robot of screech's to take you to South America and to the top of a volcano where I will sinisterly drop you in to the boiling hot magma and watch you writhe and boil and burn like eels would if <i>they</i> were placed in a volcano filled with liquid hot magma or like deer would if <i>they</i> were placed in a volcano filled with liquid hot magma or...""  Mr. Belding trailed off as he realized no one was listening to him anymore and were more concerned with finishing their breakfast.  ""Hey hey hey hey, WHAT is going on here?  Listen to me!  Kevin, do your duty!""

So Kato and Mando were grabbed forcefully by the robot kevin and they flew out the window as Johnny, Brad, George, and Ewan watched in horror.  Hours after flying, they arrived in South America and were taken to the top of the volcano Mr. Belding had previously threatened them and many animals with.  Mr. Belding laughed maniacally as Kato and Mando writhed and wriggled just as eels would if they were being held above a volcano filled with liquid hot magma or just as deer would if they were being held above a volcano filled with liquid hot magma or...anyway...What Belding didn't notice were the faint outlines of other figures in the sky, zooming toward them as if on Firebolt broomsticks, the fastest racing brooms in the world both magical and muggle.  These broomsticks were 10 tousand times as fast as these days' blueberry muffins and probably even more than that when compared to the old floating french toasts.  The four figures were long-time admirers of Kato and Mando and they were Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Cedric Diggory, and Sean Biggerstaff (all actors from the Harry Potter movies, except for Cedric Diggory who is, in fact, a character, but move on already).  They flew straight toward Kato and Mando as the two were released from Kevin's mechanical grasp and were freefalling towards the liquid hot magma whilst writhing and wriggling just as an eel or a deer would (you get the point).  Daniel, Rupert, Sean, and ehem...Cedric plucked the two from the jaws of death and sped upwards, away from the liquid hot magma towards the shocked and appalled Mr. Belding and Kevin, the robot.  In his state of appalled shock, Mr. Belding fell sideways off of Kevin and hurtled into the volcano filled with liquid hot magma whilst writhing and wriggling just as an eel or a deer would in that situation (now <i>that's</i> irony).  Kevin went after his one true love, Mr. Belding, and also disappeared into the flames.

Kato and Mando stared dreamily at their young, hunky saviors and sped off to New Zealand, where they spent many mornings elegantly breakfasting on muffins and french toast with raisins and powdered sugar after wild nights of amazing hippogriff sex.

The End.  

for now......."

"event","Once Upon a time in a land far, far away lived two young lassies (chicks, not the dog).  They're names were Snow Mandy and Sleeping Katie.  They were the bestest of friends throughout their childhood.  Whenever one found themselves helplessly in a pickle or trapped in a mysterious blue aura that smelled suspiciously like cottage cheese, the other would surely help and save the day.  Sleeping Katie loved playing the victim because she always had to be the center of attention when anyone's life was at stake. Their days were like this often and never bothered either of the friends UNTIL...

One day, an evil force took over Snow Mandy's body.  This evil force was the malicious spirit of Nick Carter whom they had previously banished to South America due to their undying distaste for his ugly face and whiny voice.  He had died while in South America a very very painful death when a pack of wild flesh-eating hermit crabs chased him through the dense forest, driving him over the edge of a gaping crevass and into jagged rocks where he was devoured (still alive) by a tribe of angry cannibalistic midgets.  Instead of going straight to hell for that previously stated whiny voice, he decided to get the ultimate revenge upon Snow Mandy, who had banished those midgets as well to south america for not participating in Snow Mandy and Sleeping Katie's annual midget toss competition.  Anywho...one day when she was sleeping in her chamberbed, sandwiched between her loveslaves Hayden Christenson and Steve Irwin (the Crocodile Hunter) after a night of wild, hot, animal chipmunk sex, when the spirit of Nick Carter suddenly overtook her body.  She had the sudden urge to jump up on the bed and start dancing pathetically and singing in that annoying whiney voice: ""OH MY GOD, WE'RE BACK AGAIN...BACKSTREET'S BACK...ALRIGHT!""  So she did, and her love slaves quickly left in disgust.  Snow Mandy was crushed.  And then she ordered her personal slaves to go and bring in her new batch of love slaves: Josh Hartnett and Doug from 2gether.  Little did she know that by the time they got there, she would be long gone.  The spirit of Nick Carter had other plans in store for her...

Meanwhile, Sleeping Katie wasn't exactly sleeping.  Her love slaves, Adam Brody (from the OC) and Dr. Evil were massaging her feet and sensually feeding her carrots dipped in ranch.  All of a sudden, she got a strong wave of ESPN (their own personal telepathic channel) from Snow Mandy implicating something terribly amiss in their midst.  She swiftly jumped upon her Swiffer Wet Jet (regular broomsticks are just so outdated) and flew off into the misty morning sunrise to save her bestest friend.  Upon arriving at the amazingly well decorated and large castle that Snow Mandy lived in, she found her on the roof singing ""I want it that way.""  She immediately knew that the monstrous spirit of the youngest Backstreet Boy had inhibited the body of her partner in crime.  There was only one way to release her of the horrible filth that was his spirit:  Boyband Exorcism.

Sleeping Katie knew exactly what this disease called for:  and so she called for it.  More of their loveslaves were summoned.  They arrived on a giant slice of raisin french toast (the kind with powdered sugar on it) that flew straight up to the roof.  One of the men stepped off and greeted Sleeping Katie.  ""The blueberry muffin was temporarily out of order.  We had to get the old French Toast out...sorry for the delay, my gorgeous and sinfully delicious queen.  How may Nsync be of your service?""  The man reached down and kissed Sleeping Katie's hand.  Sleeping Katie removed the cloak from his head and saw that it was the manly Justin Timberlake.  She glanced toward the french toast and noticed there were only three other men on the flying breakfast food.  ""Where is the fifth member of your clan, Justin?"" she asked with doe eyes as she gazed into his staggering blue eyes.  ""Oh...Lance?  He's dead.  He was captured by an evil boyband on Planet Kartoffelsalat, but when he tried to escape, he was sucked into a black hole upon which he suffocated and spontaneously combusted.""  Justin shrugged.  The other guys giggled.  ""Hmm.."" Sleeping Katie nodded.  ""Anyway, so there is an evil force that has possessed my bestest friend here.  I know you guys can help me.  I'm counting on you.  This may be painful to hear, but you must practice your Boyband Exorcism skills to remove the repulsive spirit of Nick Carter from Snow Mandy.  It must be a dance-off.""

The four beautiful hunks of male flesh gasped.  Nick Carter was the one member of the Backstreet Boys they had not yet destroyed in a dance off.  They thought they had lost their chance at destroying Nick when they heard of his death and they were excited to hear that they had one remaining chance to desecrate the one remaining member of their pathetic excuse for a musical rival in the history of all musical rivals, including LFO and O-Town and The Moffats and 5ive and Hanson and 98*.  Dance-offs were their specialty.

So they called Snow Mandy over and had the easiest dance off of their lives.  After a mere 25 pelvic thrusts, Snow Mandy's head started spinning in circles and the putrid spirit of nick carter was shot out of her mouth.  He confronted the group, but with one good ""bye bye bye"" Nick was sucked into the pits of hell for all eternity.  

After that, all six of them jumped onto the flying french toast and flew to Lichtenstein where they all had wild chipmunk sex and lived happily ever after.

The End."

I'm still a bit stressed over this thing and I have crazy and scary dreams about it.  I feel like I've had more freakouts in the last week to last me all of next year.  I need to stop stressing.

My stomach thing turned into a really weird thing and I'm not sure exactly what it was (the doctors don't even know) but it was a lot more serious than I was taking it.  So I've spent the last week in the hospital under intensive care, and I'm finally back out and kicking.

I'm stressed.  I'm stressed about the work I missed.  School.  I missed the play.  I was looking forward to being in that play more than anything and then I couldn't be in it.  I have papers to write, final projects to do, and I just don't have a lot of strength still.  It's okay...the school didn't expect me to come back this term at all.  They wanted me to take the rest of the term off and be at home.  But this is my life.  I can't just NOT live it.  So I'm getting what I can done and what a can't get done...I can turn in next term sometime.  Not bad, but I'm still stressing out about it.  I just want to take the courses normally and so me will have to overlap now and oh geez...I just don't know.  

It took a lot out of me, I'll say that.  And I'm not a pretty sight to look at.  I have bruises all over the place, and my face and scalp are dry and peely.  The hospital really really sucks.  I hated it.  I couldn't do anything for myself.  I couldn't move, I couldn't walk, I couldn't eat.  I hated the smell.  I'm just glad to be out of there.

And my parents left this afternoon.  It's quiet around here, but it is what I need.  I wish I could go out, but I don't want to get too tired and I know that it doesn't take much to tire me out.  I should write one of my papers now, but I might just crawl back in bed for a little while.

Thanks to everyone who called to check up with me, if i didn't get back to all of you I will...I'm just taking it one day at a time right now."

It wasn't life threatening, they said.  So I came home and slept for a little while, but my stomach never stopped spasming.  So I went to the doctor around 3 and she prescribed me a whole bunch of stuff.  Unfortunately, she said that she had  never seen anything like this before.  She called about 4 or 5 doctors while I was there, and was very nice.  Professor Abrams came over to my dorm to check up on me.  He brought me green tea and chocolate chip cookies.  it was very nice.  He also took emily to the pharmacy to get my medicine and paid for it.  Everyone has been calling to check on me....my whole floor signed a get well soon card, and generally I'm being pampered.

Last night was tough.  I don't really know how a got through it, but I did.  Adam stayed over and was very sweet to me.  My doctor has called twice this morning.

Homesickness is getting a bit worse.  I don't know if it helped or hurt me when I talked to Tony Borzotta for about 4 hours yesterday.  We both miss Skyline and Graeter's.  I told Adam that I was homesick, and he told me that I would get over it.  I suppose I will, but sometimes, I would like to just flop on my real bed an stare out of my window to the peaceful quietness of suburbia, cincinnati.  No drunk freshmen stumbling by my dorm at 3 in the morning, laughing and making a ruckus.  I miss Tucker a lot.  I'm worried that my puppy won't remember who I am.  He was still so young when I left.  I just want to hold him in my arms and play with him, and scratch his ears.  

I think I'm just stressing about everything.  The show is next week.  I'm not doing so hot in a few classes.  I feel dumb a lot.  I got sick last night.  Not even really sick.  But my stomach muscles kept contracting like they do when you throw up.  I wasn't throwing up, though.  I wasn't even gagging or dry heaving.  My stomach muscles just kept contracting, making me double over.  I got really cold, started shivering, my teeth were chattering.  I was really scared because then I started breathing kinda funny.  I was with Adam at the time, too.  He helped me through it, but it was a total spaz attack.  I don't know what happened, but I was really scared.  I felt like a fucking mental patient.  I hope he doesn't think that I'm some fucked up nutter now.

I guess I just need to get more sleep and to lower my stress by not procrastinating on my work.  

Mm...autumn and hot chocolate."

I tried giving blood yesterday.  Unfortunately, I could not because I have an iron deficiency or something.  So I have bad blood.  

I'm at work right now.  Just chilling out.  

Yay."

"event","Yeah, I'm updating again after a day.  So sue me.  It's 9:30 in the morning and I'm bored and I don't want to write this paper.

So today is the big day to vote!  Is everyone out there dashing to the polls?  I'm not.  And I didn't even get to fill out a little absentee ballot because stupid Hamilton County never sent it to me.  I gave them plenty of time, too.  What a bummer, that I don't get to vote in my first election.  

I miss everyone at home.  

I have a ton of work to do this week.  I don't know if I'll get it all done (or done well, at least) but I'm trying just as hard as I can.  I feel dumb.  I feel stupid in some of these classes.  I just don't feel up to par.  

Jesus, I feel like a dumbass sometimes."

She bought me dinner, (filet mignion...yummy!) and I also went shopping for some clothes while I was there.  It was really great to see her, I miss her more than I realized.

"event","I had a pretty good weekend.  I hung out with adam friday afternoon and evening, which was fun.  It consisted of me watching a lot of boys play video games and fooseball.  I also watched two episodes of The Sopranos.  Pretty good show, I must say.  It was the first time I had seen it.  Saturday consisted of me chilling around the dorm.  Emily's little sister came over and we hung out a bit.  It was entertaining.  Saturday night, I went to see Anchorman with Emily, Sam, Adam, Chandler, and Ryan.  It was still funny, like the first time i watched it.  Sunday I worked on my english paper all day and got NOWHERE.  At least it isn't due until next monday.  I drank a lot of coffee last night and then was up until almost 4 in the morning.  Not working on my paper...I was mostly singing songs at the top of my lungs.  Then while Emily was working on her homework, I read the first 70 pages of ""Without You"" to her.  Then I stopped and went to bed.

Tomorrow I have a midterm in Dramatic Analysis.  But I'm really excited for tomorrow night because i am going to a lecture on how to make movies for the IMAX.  It should be very interesting.  It'll be at the Franklin Institute.  I've never been there, so I'm excited.  I'm also excited for this weekend.  I'm going to New York on Saturday to visit my mum who'll be there on business.  I'm having dinner with her, spending the night, then coming back sunday afternoon.  Then I'm going to a Halloweek party, I suppose.  I still have to find a costume for it.  I dunno what I should be.  Any sugggestions?

Rehearsals for the play are going well.  Tonight I had to learn the words to ""Ave Maria"" because my character bursts into song at one point.  Its not that bad, but I already forget how to sing it.  My next rehearsal is on monday, too...so i hop i remember it by then.  I'm supposed to practice it.  I also need to learn my lines.  won't be too hard.  It's not like another ""Proof.""  

So things are overall going well.  I'm very happy."

"event","I've seen quite a few movies lately.  I will talk about them now.

Today I saw ""Being John Malcovich.""  No, it isn't new, but its the first time I saw it.  I thought it was decent.  I thought it was really a good concept, but there were a lot of gaps in the script.  I felt like something was missing.  I think it needed something more, but I can't put my finger on what it was.  Maybe it'll come to me in a few hours.  It could have been better.  It could have been more disturbing, too.  I know what it was!  There were too many events that were just too far-fetched, even in the context of the script.  I give it a B-.

Yesterday I saw ""Team America.""  SO FUNNY.  Some parts were a bit disturbing (ie:  the puppets having sex, one puppet puking a lake in the middle of an alley) but overall, it was a really really funny movie that kept me laughing.  My favorite was the theme song:  America!  FUCK YEAH! You can lick my ass and suck my balls!  America!  FUCK YEAH! 
...or something like that.  It was very entertaining.  I give it an A-.

Friday I saw ""Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter.""  The WORST movie I've ever seen in my life.  First off, it was canadian.  Secondly, the audio was all dubbed over and was irritating as hell.  There were a few creepy musical numbers...one with an out of place transvestite that nurses Jesus back to health.  The plot line was something like this:  Vampires are killing all of Canada's lesbians.  Jesus comes to save them, but has to become some sort of retro-jesus first.  He starts kicking some major vampire ass and at the end, his girlfriend turns out to be a lesbian and his pro wrestler friend falls in love with a lesbian.  I've never seen a movie on such crack before.  Painful, would describe the experience well.  I give it a double F.

Sometime last week I saw ""Animal House"" for the first time all the way through.  Of course, funny as hell and I don't have to say much more than that.  A.

Two weeks ago I saw ""The Undertaker and his Pals.""  Funny as hell too, but it was just one of those ""so bad that its good"" movies.  It was made in the 60's.  I found it to just be entertaining.  C.

That concludes this movie review session."

"event","A month ago, I was <i>almost</i> here.  I can't believe it that I've just been here a month.  It seems much longer than that.  But then again, everything is moving so fast in every aspect of life.

My first paper was due last friday and I'm damn proud of it.  I don't know when I'll receive it back, but I hope that I did as well as I think I did.  My first exam will be on Wednesday this week in Physics.  I'm really super nervous.  I won't do very well on it because i really just don't understand it.  Well, I sort of understand what we did the last few weeks better than what we're doing now, but hopefully i won't fail.  I'm aiming for a B.  I've done all of the homework and I've taken all of the quizzes, so hopefully that will help my grade out ultimately.

But you (my audience) don't care about that, do you?  You want to hear something juicy about my life.  Okay, so here it is:  Adam.  I've been sort of dating him and he is a really sweet guy.  We've hung out pretty much every weekend since I came.  For whatever reason, I feel weird writing about him in here though.  I think its just because I'm still kind of cautious about the relationship (even though its extremely obvious that we both really like each other).  I don't want to get ahead of myself and I don't want to post about anything intimate that has been going on.  So that is that.  I am very very happy, though.  I can't imagine things going more smoothly.

That actually sums up all of college for me...smooth.  I'm really fitting in more here.  I've found a group of people that i can hang out with.  And even though I'm the only freshman in most situations, it helps because adam is there with me.  Being friends with a whole bunch of upperclassmen has its advantages.  And no, I'm not talking about alcohol because I haven't been drinking...I'm just talking about having a more secure net of people around me.  They've all been friends, but they have accepted me and have in some ways extended that friendship to me.  The play will help me.  Speaking of the play, it is going well.  I've only had one rehearsal so far, but my next is tomorrow.  I only have rehearsals twice a week for the next few weeks because my part is relatively small.  I don't mind...it gives me more time to work on my studies and I have to work at the writing center three days a week.  I really enjoy everything I'm involved in so far.  

I have been looking into the classes I'll take next term.  I'll start scheduling in the next week, I believe.  I'm going to be adding a few courses to my planned schedule.  I'm going to add some film courses.  I feel like I need to keep up with the film kids with where they are.  So I dont know if drexel offers it or not, but i'm thinking about double majoring in film and screenwriting.  If they don't offer it, I'll just take as many film courses as I can.  I want to work the hardest I can so I can be the best.  Yes, I am obsessed with competition now.  I think i've already talked about that though.  But anyway, I think I'll take two extra film courses if I can:  Fundamentals of Video Production and Lighting for Film and Video.  I talked to the advisor of all of the film kids, and she said that those were the two classes that i pretty much had to take before I started any other film courses.  I don't want to overdo it, but I definitely want to be as active as I can in making my education the best.  

It's insane that I'm ACTUALLY studying film.  How bizzare is that?  Something that I've always loved to do...and now I'm actually LEARNING about it.  I feel like I've won the coolest educational lottery ever.  

I've never been happier."

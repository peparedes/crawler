"event","<P>jesus, protect me from your followers.<BR>how dare the christians get all hateful on will &amp; grace about that <BR>planned episode with britney spears.<BR>*quick scoop: britney was set to play some tv host on a cooking <BR>show called crucifixins' and due to christian activist groups<BR>complaining that it would denigrate christianity, the episode has<BR>been rewritten*<BR>this is so ridiculous. the one comment I keep seeing in every<BR>story about this is that the christians think NBC does<BR>not exhibit hatefulness towards jews or muslims etc etc and only<BR>towards the followers of christ. um, so? NBC = huge fags. <BR>an appropriote quote ""its a gay network, the symbol is a peacock!""<BR>Its such a stupid thing to be complaining about considering the<BR>horrible things said about every homosexual<BR>(ya kno, 15% of the world population) by these christian activist <BR>groups. Even if I dont buy it, it doesn't feel good to hear that <BR>I'm going to burn in hell for eternity on the crime of loving <BR>another. <BR>I read somewhere that the main argument for this was that<BR>young readers would see the episode and be swayed to think<BR>that christianity just isn't so hot and that homosexuality is <BR>clearly the right choice.<BR>and as for the power of christ? sure, its pretty compelling, <BR>but ya kno, not when put up against the sacred word of britney<BR>spears.<BR>back on topic, shouldn't the kiddies not even be seeing this <BR>show? its rated PG14, if christian parents were truely concerned <BR>that their children be sheilded from this *gasp* public attack<BR>on the legitimacy of christianity then they should cut <BR>off their eyes and ears.<BR>[Edit: they should get that nifty TV parental control thing]<BR>[Edit: ..or a more legitimate religion]</P>
<P>But seriously, if you believe in and love your idea of god,<BR>that's cool, and it's your decision. Do not preach hate about <BR>my decisions because of your decisions.<BR>Similarly, I will carry on my life as i choose to, as will the <BR>pretty kickass writers at NBC (except not cuz they're bending <BR>right over for these activists)</P>
<P>""art is supposed to comment on culture, that is the function of art""<BR>come' on folks, its america. If we aren't going to let people say what<BR>they wanna say, lets at least be fair. What about the muslims? NBC <BR>might not rag on them too too much, but the rest of your goddamn country<BR>sure as shit does. There's a movie coming out that has this super stereotyped<BR>arab group put forward some guy on this american idol-like show to kill the <BR>president. I saw the preview in the theatres and the reaction from the audience<BR>was that of disgust. We aren't subjected to a whole lot of the islamic religion<BR>here in north america, but i'm pretty sure we shouldnt be assualting their beliefs<BR>so much and assuming that they're ALL terrorists (if for no other reason, than <BR>because they might actually all be terrorists, and they might get pissed off <BR>sooner or later...)</P>
<P>I just wish someone important would have the balls to not censor such <BR>things that offend christianity on the reasoning that theres rarely talk<BR>of pulling all media with hateful messages about homosexuality, or judaism, <BR>or islam etc etc etc. If not that I wish the christian activists would try for<BR>such goals themselves, upon realizing that its as hurtful to other religions as<BR>it is to theirs, and that their religion has somewhat firm stipulations about<BR>loving thy brother. </P>
<P>This isolated incident with the Will &amp; Grace episode did not inspire <BR>all of this ranting from me, it's just an isolated incident of<BR>ignorant white people getting supremely offended when those who<BR>they have stepped on for decades decide to take a tiny jab back. <BR>""crucifixins""?, I'll concede it definately cheapens the sanctity <BR>of jesus's crucifixion, and I'll concede that jesus was a pretty <BR>alright guy. However, what about stonewall? what about dont ask dont tell?<BR>what about matthew shepard? what about that lesbien dying of cancer <BR>right now who just spent the last months of her life fighting tooth and<BR>nail just for the right to leave her pension to her partner?<BR>These events hurt actual people who had done nothing wrong. more<BR>seriously I'm willing to wager than the hurt that might've been felt<BR>by a christian who would've seen mrs federline say their religion <BR>wasn't cool. <BR>Had the episode aired as planned, it would not have defeated the spirit<BR>of christianity.<BR>Have you guys learned nothing yet?</P>"

"event","watching Oprah go freak crazy all over retarded author's ass is the best peice of television ever.
It's funny though, if he didn't lie his aaasss off and if it had been released just as a novel that was based on a true story, it'd probably still be a best seller, and the entire world wouldn't be aware that he's a bumbling imbisile. 
To his credit, he did not soil himself on stage, which is more than I think I could say for myself if Oprah and I were throwin' down on national television."

"event","eventful weekend:

friday night - got harrassed by a crazy rotund fellow in my lobby. finally got a call from my monctonian lover mitchell k at around eleven, and headed over to his photographers place to pick him up. we were accidently wearing nearly the same outfit, including our double breasted peacoats. 
""whenever I wear it I can only think about how I want to change the buttons to silver ones"" - kindred fags. I dont see my mitchell enough. we pretty much just cruised around downtown doing nothing and got pizza at le corner. 

saturday - went to Ians mid afternoon to get the liquor run on so we could get the drink on asap. after the fucking frigid walk (its winter now??) there and back, johoe realized 10 feet from the door that she forgot to get my rum. we had to go all the way back, and ended up carrying half the floors liquor run back with us. nice and plastered by 8 o clock, met lots of amazing ladies. 

meredith - ""your only eighteen??? i feel like such a statuatory rapist""
ben - ""but darling we're not having sex yet""
meredith - ""but darling that doesn't mean I wasn't imagining it""

jo's petit homosexual brother loses his liquor at about 11, postponing the bar for everyone (else). once most of them got there, the powergrid was blown out for the bar (easy, hurricane).
I got to spent the whole sick boy drama in Ians room getting hit on on msn (oh brian) and talking to other mitchell. 

spent sunday hangovering at ians. hangovers are no fun.
so I spent sunday night outrunning the hangover in Jojos room."

"event","I'm starting to feel like a queer outsider, its entirely strange. I like everything gay. I don't try to, I hate it when superfags complain because being gay isn't 100% of their identity (hate it even more when that tottaly isn't true...)
But I really didn't enjoy brokeback mountain, and I'm getting fucking sick about reading/hearing all the time about it being the best friggin queer thing to ever happen. Sure, it was a nice story, and it hits close to home for the majority of gay men who had a hard time in the closet, but its just a stupid movie.
Major Issues:
-lack of aging. How old is Anne Hathaway? I don't care, but I do know that making her blonde did not make her look 40+. and Heath Ledger managed to maintain the same cut and colour for 25 years, although in the last scenes he had some nasty looking scaley makeup action around his eyes that can only be assumed was to make him look older, but i dont know any 40 year old men with scaley eyes. I won't say anything about Jake, they gave him a moustache, thats character development. 
-lack of acting on the part of the actors. Heath ledger ""cried"" like 3-4 times in this movie and I did not see one tear. 
-my strange lack of sympathy for enormous assholes. Heath's character is nothing but a dickhead to fucking everyone in the entire movie and I do not understand why we're supposed to feel bad about his personal troubles. When I've said that to anyone they just say that its because he was in such anguish, but thats no excuse in real life for fucking around on your wife, and treating your boyfriend like shit, and that little tart girlfriend near the end. WHAT ABOUT HER!???
-The last one isn't actually a complaint about the movie, its about Jake Gylenhaal. I've read a whole lot that he keeps saying in interviews that the characters are not gay, they're just two heterosexual souls that fell in love with one another. (which is firstly a stupid thing to say because obviously the only audience in the first place for this movie is hetero women and FAGS).... but its Jake's character in the movie who shoves Heath's hand down his pants, and its Jake's characters in the movie who serves it up (lube-free? bitch he'd done that before).. and its Jake's character in the movie who tries to nail the rodeo clown, and Jakey again going to mexico and scamming hustlers in the alley and hitting on that cowboy married to the chick from scary movie. ALL JAKE. thats some gay behavior my friend. 
There, while I didn't fully hate the movie, I was entertained almost throughout, and some of the cinematography close to the beginning was amazing, it does occur to me that not nearly as many gay men would consider it a beautiful movie or an important movie if it was maggie gylenhaal and some other broad banging in a tent. 
However However However, it is nice to see gay presense in the media without the inclusion of hard drugs and screaming queens.

<3 Ben

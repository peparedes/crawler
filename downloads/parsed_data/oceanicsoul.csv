"event","I got to school extra early today to do my admission committee stuff, and so I'm just killing time now before my first interviewee comes in at 9. 

I've always wanted to get something off my chest out these MD applicants -- why do they ALL want to go to Africa?? I know, I know. Some students probably have a very genuine concern for a population riddled with famine, infectious disease, genocide, and just general wackiness. But I can't help but feel most of them use it as a buzzword to be like, ""hey, look, I care about people!"" 

Personally, I believe that medical interventions are necessary but not sufficient; to be quite honest I think medicine isn't close to the top of the list of things Africa needs. Sure, we can give multivitamin supplements, grains, and condoms -- but it all doesn't matter if the population doesn't learn how to sustain it, or if the government won't allow a peaceful society that CAN sustain it. So the argument ""if you let me into med school and I'll save Africa"" doesn't fly too well with me without justification... cause I really know it means please let me in, and I'll just be a US doctor that's wealthy and I'll donate $25 a year to Africa. Because it takes a lot of courage and determination to rack up $200K+ in debt and fly to a unstable, poor country and serve that population at your own expense -- far more than some applicants claim themselves to possess."

Whatever, I feel like I've gotten a good thing going. I had a bunch of things that I planned to work on and part of me wanted to just sit at home and relax once winter break began. However, since my test finished I've been:

Eating froyo
Crepes for a friend's bday 
Eating frogo again
Watching a friend suck alcohol from a tampon/Kris dancing on the bar
A blast from the orient in the form of Mr. Brett
Various card games, video games, and boba
Assembled Kris' new piano

I guess I can't complain. I'll have to look back on this when I'm dying studying for boards to remind myself, ""it was worth it"". lol"

"event","Today my old lab PI Dennis (Santa Claus) took us out to lunch. It was a nice hibachi restaurant nearby. It was a great time -- a lot of familiar faces, jokes, and a warming time. Thus the issue of family crept into my mind.

I simply remember working with my parents, eating meals, and such. Some of my fondest memories of my father are going to the wholesale store market together and stopping by the Far East Center for snacks. Or possibly when it wasn't busy we'd play Chinese chess out in the parking lot. I'd do some side work, like make egg rolls and stuff with my mom during the afternoon. 

But vacations, holidays, birthdays? We never had the time, and so I don't have the memories.

I don't really share it, but it almost makes me uncomfortable to have people look out for me. It's definitely too dramatic an analogy, but it's the slight sting that you feel coming in from the snow. When Kris' mother bought me a tie for Christmas last year, it was such an unexpected act of kindness and caring to me that I felt stunned. The same feelings came when Eric's parents gave us all gift bags to go to college with, or when I found out Dennis went out of his way to express his confidence in me to the Dean at Cornell. I felt so glad to be cared for it almost scared me -- that caring seems so fragile I fear indulging in that feeling might somehow break it."

"event","I'm such a kid at heart still. Whenever I have free time I'm preoccupied with video games, card games, my favorite television shows, and the upcoming D&D sessions (yes, I know, I'm a nerd). Sometimes I think I wrap myself in so much fantasy because its something I aspire to in a way. The things that we're taught to want in life -- a lot of money, nice things, access to exclusive clubs and bars, to be envied for my status... I can't say I don't want all of that as well, but not enough that I actively work towards it. Instead, I want to have that shining moment that you only find in stories. Although there's no monsters or villians, there definitely is real darkness in this world and I want to help someone overcome it. 

But now that I'm only a few months away from entering my clinical training reality is setting in. I've always been fairly good at test taking and academics, and I'm confident I can pass medical school with no problems. The problem is that at the end of the day my real knowledge remains so elusive -- I can't keep every syndrome, every value, in my mind. I make mental notes to review it all but there's never enough time. I'm unsure if I can really become who I set out to be, and that's a little scary."

"event","Okay, I've decided to start blogging everyday -- just anything and everything for a few minutes.

I'm going to resist making much fanfare about this, because it's really dubious as to whether I'll be able to hold myself to it or not lol. Hopefully this isn't spurred on solely from the fact that I'm bored as hell sitting in lecture and learning about how young women need to eat calcium.

"event","Whew, first day at the oncology clinic:

Patient 1 - D.D., a 54 yr old man is suffering from metastatic head and neck carcinoma. Treated surgically, aggressive radiation therapy, and with chemotherapy. Radiation caused burns to left neck and subclavicular, which had become infected. Patient taken off chemo and put on antibiotics, recently undergone maggot therapy to remove necrotic tissue. Sores are still very large and have yellow film. Also, had noticed a recent growth in hilar lympth node (1.4 cm in diameter). Once off antibiotics will resume herbatox (an organic chemotheraputic drug that targets a specific epitheilial growth factor). Avastin works in a similar mechanism.

Patient 2 - C.S., a male who had a melanoma develop on the forehead, which migrated via the bloodstream to the lymph node residing in the parotid gland. Has grown significantly over the past two weeks and is pressing against the facial nerve causing pain and discomfort, resulting in insomnia. Requires a PET scan to determine if cancer has spread to lungs. Patient refuses chemotherapy, which has a 20-30% chance of effectiveness.

Patient 3 - B.S., a female who previously had two left breast carcinomas (removed by mastectomy) came in for routine breast exam. Exam negative. Patient recently fell down stairs, large lump on head; monitor for headaches or double vision indicating slow progressing subdural hematoma.

Patient 4 - C.M., a 67 year old male developed colon cancer in 1998, removed surgically. Then melanoma in 2001, which was excised (along with 1/3 of the lymph nodes of the axilla). The scar from 2001 still exists today with a small scab; slow healing most likely due to chemotherapy (post-cancer standard six month course of fullfox).

Patient 5 - E.T., a 42 year old female diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in Dec 2001. This was treated with hercutan (sp?) that targets esotrogen receptive cells, and now uses Tycobb (sp?) 6 tablets a day which is the pill form of hercutan. She also takes 2 zolotov/day, the combination is giving her severe diarrhea. Will stop zolotov and titrate back to 6 tablets of Tycobb to cease diarrhea. Also, two brain tumors have developed, which will be treated with gamma knife. 

Patient 6 - a 75 year old female has a small lung carcinoid that has not grown in several years; her liver enzymes seem normal but a growth has developed in the liver. This is most likely a carcinoid as well. No treatment will be administered, patient will be monitored.

Patient 7 - T.S., a 45 year old female previously had stage I breast cancer caught early, which was removed surgically. Patient has gained 10 lbs over the past month, saying because her father died recently. Exercise and low fat diet are essential in preventing recurrance of brest cancer (by reducing volume of adipose tissue). She is currently treated with tamoxaffin.

Patient 8 - A.W., a 71 year old female had stage II left breast carcinoma. She had a mastectomy done, come in for a physical exam which came up negative. She is on femarra, which may be causing her hot flashes, tingling in the wrists, fingertips, and back of legs possibly; will cease femarra for two weeks, if symptoms improve then will choose a different chemotheraputic drug.

Patient 9 - a 46 year old female came in seeking 2nd opinion. She had a rectal cancer above the peritoneal reflection (at the level of the sigmoid colon), detected by colonoscopy, which was surgically removed. Surgeon believes all cancer removed but wary of cells left adhered to the posterior abdominal wall. Will use standard six month course of fullfox; patient declined radiation therapy (which would be excessive, but safer) because she needs reproductive organs reconnected (disconnected during removal of growth). Ordered a PET scan, and requires regular mammograms."

"event","I wanted to journal my med school experiences someplace, but procrastination is always a formidable foe and has bested me to date.

Now I have this big backlog of things that could separate posts on their own (orientation week, first dissection, first big exam, medical society meetings, school life in general) so this more general post will simply get the ball rolling for me.

As I spend time with my classmates I can feel all the cynicism and frustrations I developed over the years begin to melt away, and replaced with a true sense of purpose. Our highly motivated student population (11 out of 157 have climbed Kilimanjaro) ranges from a 46 year old former pilot and a surfing journalist to nurses & EMTs to... me. Despite our differences, we're united by a real desire to make a difference. The anatomy professor has told us he's never seen students spend so much time in the anatomy lab -- we proved that's not simply an annual platitude he says to other classes because on the exam 22 students scored above 70 on the lab exam (out of 75), whereas from the classes above us only 5 or less have managed to do so. My classmates remind me that if you don't like the way the world is, we are the intelligent and passionate individuals who will stand up and change it. During a conversation I had on Friday, Julian stopped and asked me, ""James, you really want to save the world, don't you?"" When I replied, ""of course,"" instead the dismissive reaction I usually expect he looked to the sky with a ""yea."" As class co-president I shared many of these moments with my peers, moments so saturated with hope and ambition you can't help but believe the world just might turn out OK.

(Ironically, we're also known to the older classes as the ""crazy"" class cause we drink & party ALL the freaking time. I miss a lot of bar events/parties cause I hang out with Kris and the Asian crowd, and my liver already feels bloated. Go burning the candle at both ends!)"

"event","So I just happened to read something about how a lot of people are demanding additional legislation against food companies from marketing towards young children (under 12) -- stuff like oreos and pop tarts.

First of all, let me just say I'm already surprised there has been ANY legislation already. With how inefficiently our congress works (takes weeks to make a do-nothing ""no confidence"" vote) I can't believe they spend time on something like this. 

I just want to slap everyone of these adults with fat kids and tell them to learn to raise their own children. Kids will anyways want candy and junk food regardless of what they see on tv. Your kids won't eat pop tarts or oreos if you just DON'T BUY THEM. When you take your kids shopping and they demand something, tell them NO. I don't know what little kids can get themselves to the grocery store, or even have the money to buy tons of junk food when they get there. Stop picking up KFC for dinner, put some fruits and vegetables in your house, and you'll stop having stay-puft marshmellow children. It doesn't matter what your kid sees on tv if you have your own daily twinkie time yourself."

"event","A few weeks ago I was driving home with Kris, we talked about why I also refer back to my HS times so often and why I treasure those memories moreso than my times in college.

Admittedly in those times I was popular and well-liked, whereas at Cornell I often felt mislabeled and misunderstood. Despite the solid friendships and good times I enjoyed in college, I never recovered the past feelings of being connected and influential -- I felt the atmosphere would be unchanged whether I was there or not. There are people who would say that is pretty pompous of me to be unsatisfied because of that reason alone, but it's just the way I am.

Everyone that knows me well knows that I never overachieve for the sake of overachieving -- I never do things for the sake of writing it down on a resume. Behind all my hard work lies the belief that a certain greatness resides within me; extracting it is simply a matter of my own tenacity. We all believe the world can be a better place than it is now. A lot of people retreat within their own little bubble and get by skipping from one fleeting pleasure to the next. A smaller few feel dissatisfied, but choose to adapt to the way the world works to achieve their goals of security or wealth. I want to take it a step further, and be someone that can really shape the world with my own hands. When I say I want to be recognized, I don't mean to be looked up to, but to be trusted -- to have my ideas and values and my name have weight in the world. That's why I work so hard, and why I'll continue to do so.

""Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh"""

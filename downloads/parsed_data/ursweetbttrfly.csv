"event","Just another great Tuesday back at Pru. Blah. Lets discuss how its 11:30 and I'm STARVING! Seriously, I don't understand my body sometimes. Yesterday I didn't eat lunch until almost 2:30, and that was only because I felt like I should eat something, not because I was actually hungry. Now today, at like 10:30 I started to feel hungry. Whats with that? Random thought of the day.

Who's ready for spring? I am! I am! I want the trees to bloom and stuff. I'm tired of looking at all the dead plants. Although, I'm convinced I've been sick every day of 2005, and once stuff starts blooming, then my allergies will act up. Not really sure what I'm going to do this week. I had my gay real estate class again last night. Its tough to get back into that after having been away from it for what seems like forever. I have ZERO interest in it, so I have a hard time studying for it. I have a job interview on Thursday downtown. We'll see how that goes. I think it would be cool to work downtown, but I'll have to see what the vibe is there. Well, I think my stomach has waited long enough. Time to get lunch!

Always!"

"event","So I got busy and gave up on the 100 things about me. But hey, you got 50 and thats a good start. I figure I better leave some mystery. Haha. I have to say, this has been a marathon week for me. And now I'm exhausted, not to mention sick as shit. I can not seem to get healthy this year. It sucks. If its not one thing, its another. Everything is never just fine! I started the year with a cold that turned into a sinus infection. So then I was on antibiotics and steriods. PS, not a good combination. So after I dealt with the reaction to those two drugs, I thought I'd be alright. But no. Now I have this killer cold. I'm blaming it on temperature changes. 70 then 10 then 65 now its 30 degrees again. I love living in North Carolina, but damn if I don't get punished for it. Syracuse introduced me to this stuff, Cold-Eeeze. Its suppose to cut the duration of a cold in half, but its nasty. She swears it works, so I keep sucking on it. But it makes me gag. 

Wednesday night was too much fun! And I saw someone I hadn't seen in a while. So that was good. This weekend is the Daytona 500. Personally, I hate NASCAR. I remember, I think it was freshmen year, when Dale Earnhart died. For like a week, I couldn't figure out who the hell he was. All these people were walking around with those #3 hats and stuff. Finally one day in class I was like, what the hell happened? I mean, people acted like the president was dead. So I think my Sunday is going to be pretty boring.

36. Ellen Degeneres is a comic genius for delivering lines such as ""THE BANGS!"" and ""and I like munster""
37. Love to make out. 
38. Have developed governement conspiracy theory in which Walmart Corporation is secret division of Federal Reserve System used to bolster economic conditions by tricking low income locals, migrant farm workers and over indulged college students into purchasing large amounts of completely unnecassary items

45. Always tip at least 20%, but will tip more for attractive waitstaff
46. Wish North Carolina would get the lottery, specifically stratch off $1 tickets. Though on further contemplation have realized may develop serious gambling problem should this occur. Reason no 29385704987 why I'm glad I don't live in Ohio anymore

"event","So in an effort to thwart unattractive, unqualified people from entering my life, I've created a list of 100 things everyone should know about me. Now, I will add a couple every day for the next couple of days. If you can't deal, please move on.

1. Schrauder is not, contrary to popular belief, my first name
2. I have two dimples on one side of my face and one on the other. (You are not the first person to tell me this)
3. My father is quite possibly the smartest man I know.
4. My younger brother, is definetly the dumbest.
5. I have a slight addiction to McDonald's pop. And yes I said pop.
6. I put ice in milk. I put ice in everything. I would put ice in beer if not for the strange looks.
7.  I hate/loathe/despise George W Bush
8. I have watched Ice Age approximately 17,000 times and still think the sloth with the sylabus S is the funniest thing alive

12. I require at least one refill on every prescription regardless of what it is to treat
13. I have never cheated on a significant other, but I have been the other woman

17. Seriously afraid of snakes
18. I have, in the past, cut off 12'' of my hair to spite a boyfriend

21. My favorite class in high school was AP calculus because of the subject matter, not the teacher
22. I have helped someone cheat on an exam
23. When drinking heavily, have bad habit of making up outlandish lies. And will continue to wallow in them even when caught

First I was hot, then I was cold. Then I was thirsty. I tried everything. I got a glass of water, I tried counting sheep. Nothing is working. So I finally just decided to get up. I've got stuff I can do around the house. Maybe I'll go to Pru really early today. And I know what's going to end up happening. By the middle of this afternoon, I'm going to be exhausted. On a day when I have to be at Pru until 10 o'clock. 

Is it possible to fall in love with someone you hardly know? I think I may be in love with someone, and I don't know how or why. Anyway, another story for another time. I'm going to fold sweaters now in the hopes of getting tired.

"event","My Neubian Princess is back! I can't wait to see her. I feel like I haven't seen her in forever! It makes me so happy when friends come back after having not seen them for a while. 

I saw something today, I won't say where, but I saw something about ending relationships where you feel like you have nothing in common with a person. And how do you do it without hurting someone. I think its strange that people seem to focus so intently on everything that is wrong with their relationships. I know its an old cliche, but opposites attract. I mean, look at the family. What do we have in common? Honestly, hardly anything, and we couldn't be better friends. My best friends are the people I have the least in common with. Because I look at what I admire about them that I don't have or what they admire about me because they don't have. It works well for us. I just wish people wouldn't be so quick to jump on a bad relationship band wagan. 

How bad is it that I'm already waiting for the weekend? This weekend is going to be so much fun, especially if the princess is around! We're going to do it up right family reunion style!

Couple of maybe's in the air right now, but we'll see. Sunday afternoon I'm suppose to do an open house in Irving Park Sunday. Irving Park is a really nice neighborhood in Greensboro. For you people back in good ole Perry, its the Canyon Ridge of Greensboro. I was suppose to do it the last two weekends, but the first weekend the house had no heat and the second weekend it was too ice-y. There is suppose to be an ice storm this weekend, but keep your fingers crossed that there's not. I could use the money they pay for that. Working at Pru has probably been the most lucrative thing I could do for myself. I get more side jobs from this job then anything else. I bet I made at least half of what I make annually at Pru in side jobs. And all of that is under the table. Its great.

So I want to go to the Brightwood tonight and get the story on Elvis. The lady that owns/runs the Brightwood Bar in Whitsett has run it for like 55 years. The story is that Elvis ate there once in the 50s or 60s. Granted the Brightwood is kind of ghetto, they don't have beer on tap and hardly any in bottles. But they do have a lot of beers in cans. If you can believe that a bar would serve beers in cans. Haha. So we'll see what I do tonight. I'm just glad its the weekend!

"event","So right now I'm really pissed. Go figure. First of all, my piedmont natural gas bill is $117 this month. Which is bullshit because the only thing running on gas in this house is the fireplace and that has been completely shut off since I got the $70 bill for last month. So I'm going to have to get that sorted out tomorrow. Second, I hate real estate. I have zero interest in it and every Monday and Wednesday I spend 15 hours at Pru so that I can get my stupid real estate license. 

But the real thing I'm pissed at tonight is myself and my past. There are very few people in this world that know my whole life's history. And for good reason. Its graphic and not really all that steller. (Getting better though, everyday.) Anyway, so I am pretty picky about who gets to know what details about me. A lot of people know about me and Phil. That part I don't really hide. I keep just how bad it was pretty much to myself and about 6 other people, but the fact that he beat me is pretty much out in the open. But sometimes I trust people and tell them things about myself. Sometimes they act really interested or whatever, or if the moment is right. But something happened lately that makes me regret telling people and makes me even more guarded with my past. I told someone something about my past because he asked me to. Though I wasn't really sure if I trusted him enough yet, I knew that if I didn't tell him, it was going to drive a huge wedge between the two of us. So I told him and you know what happened? I haven't heard from him since. 

I'm hate Phil for what he did to me. I was punished enough for the relationship when I was in it. What I hate more is that I'm still being punished for it now. I can't change what happened. Trust me, if I could, I would. But I can't. Some people may not understand this, but what happened in my past made me the person I am today. And personally I think I'm alright. Sure, I like to put ice in everything and I eat peanut butter straight from the jar, but if thats the worse parts of me, I'm alright. Part of me is grateful for what happened, because it gives me a new perspective on things. I just wish that everyone else could get some perspective on that.

"event","I resolved this year to try something I did a couple of years ago. When Rob and I first broke up, I told myself that I would work really hard to be the better person. Meaning, that unless it was something really serious, I wasn't going to gripe about or to people. What's the point? It doesn't do any good. 

So instead, I'm going to talk about good people that do good things. For instance, Jerry is the guy that delivers paper to my office. He doesn't take the inventory or order the paper, he just delivers it. But he's very friendly. For some reason, the guy that takes our inventory keeps ordering more letter size paper, but never orders us any legal size paper. Who cares? You may ask. But in real estate, most contracts are legal size. So for the past month or so, we've had stacks and stacks of letter paper, but I have to keep pilaging legal from the other offices. So Monday when Jerry came to deliver the paper, I asked him if he had any legal paper for us. He said he didn't but when I explained the situation he laughed and said he would take care of it. Which I interprutted to mean we would get legal paper on the next delivery, two weeks from Monday. But today he came with two cases of legal paper. I was really impressed. 

I really think its the little things in life that people will appreciate. I heard a commercial on the radio today about complimenting people and how much you can build people up with one compliment and how easily you can beat people down with one stupid comment. Something to think about.

Which I'm blaming on the punctured lung, which I'm blaming on Phil. So there. Actually I think the coughing is psycho-symatic. I'm stressing myself sick. Which is always productive. I'm not really sure what I'm stressing about. Same old same old I imagine. Work, family, friends, men. Its always men. They think we're so damn complicated. Just not the case.

"event","I have this friend, whom I love. I don't know what it is about us, but we just get each other. I'm not saying we're perfect (well, maybe I am) and I'm not saying we never disagree. I can't say we've ever really ""fought"", but we do disagree. But the reason I love her, is that no matter what it is I'm doing, and no matter how stupid she might think it is, she'll say ""I think this is a bad idea."" And then she'll do everything she can to help me do that stupid thing. She always takes up for me. And I know that I have not always been as good a friend to her as she has been to me, but I try. We've been friends for about 4 or 5 years. Who knows. My thought today was, are we that good of friends because we've been friends for that long, or were we that good of friends from the beginning?

And then I thought, have you ever met someone that wasn't in your life very long, but you felt that way about. I had that happen recently, and it isn't that he's not in my life anymore, or at least I hope not. But when I was with him, I was always happy. He was just funny and I don't know, such a great person. And I'm sad that we haven't talked for awhile. I know he's going through a very busy time in his life, I just wish there was some way he could let me help him. But maybe by not helping him, I'm actually helping him more. 

I think this is just the time of year when I always start appreciating my friends more. And most of them know why that is. But don't worry guys, pretty soon I'll be back to taking advantage of you!! (lol...jk)

The good thing about the United Nations is that they put you up in style. He's going to have an amazing appartment. They are going to be talking about nuclear power and its effectiveness. For those of you who don't know, daddy is a nuclear engineer. Anyway, my point in this story is, Daddy has invited me to go with him to Vienna. I haven't decided if I'm going to go with him or not. A lot of people have said, how can you pass up Vienna? Well for one, I've been to Vienna, several times. Second, I know what will happen if I go to Vienna. I will not come back. I've been thinking for awhile about a change of scenery. With Brian in Spain, I feel like if I'm going to leave, this would be the time. But emmigrating to Europe is a big deal. For one, I don't speak the language. I would see my family even less than I see them now. And the people I know in Europe may or may not be anywhere near me. So my question is, do I go?"

"event","I am super excited for tonight. First of all, because my gay ass real estate class is canceled. So about that MBA...being in this real estate class reminds me of how much I hate school, studying, tests. I hate pretty much everything that has to do with school. But mostly I am excited because Poppi has his big show tonight. Even though he always insists on having them on Wednesdays, which is tough on us working people, its always a good time. Whats left of the family is coming out so it should be a good time. Unless the roommate falls asleep and pouts about having to go out, which is probably what will happen, it should be a good time. 

This weekend is going to be awesome. Someone I know is getting a huge surprise, but since they read this, I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

Today I'm very frustrated with some people in my life, but mostly I'm frustrated with myself. This guy I've been dating for a little while is blowing me off I think. Which, as annoying as that behavior is, I've come to expect it from most men. Except that this guy claimed it was behavior he hated. So either he's a hypocrite or a liar. Maybe a little bit of both. I'm frustrated with some of my friends because I am a firm believer that even if you don't necassarily agree with what your friends are doing in/with their lives, you should stand by them. And you NEVER take a man's side over your friend's. For example, if I have a boyfriend and I cheat on him and he follows me to the other guys house to prove that I'm cheating, he is scum for having followed me and for not trusting me. It does not matter that I cheated on him, HE is scum. Lately it seems some of the people who I thought were some of my best friends are just not taking my side. Another example, if I've been dating some one who you think is scum, if I'm willing to give him another chance, YOU ARE TOO! To me, thats just the way friendships work. 

But mostly, I'm annoyed with myself. I swore I would no longer surround myself with people like this and I just can't seem to stop it. I hate that what's happpening between me and the capitan is happening again. I hate that certain men claim that they want back in and I fall for it. I hate that my friends don't take up for me when I have and will ALWAYS take up for them. Always. Always Always. Its the word of the week. And everyone should use it in every context. ALWAYS"

Spain is a beautiful place and I think it will fit his personality. I'm so jealous. I'm not really sure what is keeping me from doing the same thing. Sometimes I claim its because I have a job, a mortgage, a car payment. All these things that tie me here. The car is almost paid for and I could sell the house. The job? Who cares, they'll find someone to replace me. What about emotional ties? I'm not in a serious relationship. I'm not in love. My friends will come visit and I'll certainly make new ones where ever I go.

"event","It seems that lately I hear a lot about how women cause men so much confusion. Lets talk about confusion for a minute. Why is it, that when you are totally open and available, men are not. But the minute the word gets out that you may be seeing someone, even semi seriously, everyone who wanted to ""build a more meaningful relationship"" or who didn't ""have time for a relationship"" suddenly seems to have all the time in the world and your relationship means so much to them? How do we define our relationship? I have relationships with my friends, my family, my dry cleaner. But when it comes to men, we can't even use the word. What is it about relationships that makes it so hard for men to relate?

I have never pushed for something that he didn't want, that he couldn't give. And by he, I mean any man I've ever been with. When they finally reach whatever definition they feel applies to us, I will secede to it. I never push for what I want, what I feel is what they really want but are afraid to ask for. So my new resolution, however late it may be, is to ask for what I want. The number one lesson companies will teach new sales people, is to ask for the sale. If you don't ask for it, you may never get. So here I am, asking for it. I want us to be exclusive. I want you to let me into your life and I want to let you into mine. The good, the bad, the past present and future. I want to spend nights with you. I want to have dinners with you and breakfasts and lunches. I want you to meet my parents, to understand where I've come from and where I'm going. 

What I don't want is to ask you why we're fighting over the stupid stuff. I don't want to have to ask you where you've been. I don't want to have to ask you what kind of pizza you want. I don't want to ask where this is going. It doesn't matter, as long as its going. 

I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm not asking for guarntees or promises. I'm just asking for us to be. We deserve that. Always."

Maybe tonight when I have a second, I will open it. 

I am absolutely exhausted today. I don't know who gave me the bright idea to stay up, ummm, all night, but apparently I thought that would be cool. I might have to come to grasps with my issue about fighting with men. I got had an arguement with a man last night and I absolutely could not do anything to defend myself. I was so terrified of what would happen if I said the wrong thing. I know he would NEVER hurt me, but by the time he got to my place, I had gotten myself so worked up about what was going to happen, to say the least I was crying. Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself, so I wonder what other people think.

"event","I have had popsicles on the brain for the last few days. I don't know why though. I'm sort of partial to bomber pops, the red, white and blue popsicles or ice cream sandwiches. Although, do ice cream sandwiches really fall into the popsicle catagory? Or are they more an ice cream novelty so to speak? Remember when the ice cream truck use to come and you could get all kinds of cool popsicles. Like the Super Mario Bros with the gum ball eyes? I use to love the ice cream truck, but this past summer, I really hated it. An ice cream truck use to drive through my neighborhood every morning at like 8:30. At the time I was working at the hotel, so I would still be in bed and the stupid thing had this annoying voice that would go ""Hello?"" really loud before the music came on. God it drove me nuts. There were no kids in the neighbor, just the mexican construction workers and me. And none of us were eating ice cream at 8:30 in the morning. 

My favorite ice cream memory: The Ben and Jerry's ice cream shop in Charleston with Rob. Not because of Rob, but because of the ice cream. It had been so hot the whole day we were there. And that night I made him take me on one of those ghost tours where they show you all the places that are supposedly haunted in Charleston. You had to walk all over downtown. It was so stupid and boring. So halfway through the tour I told him that if we could just peace out on the tour, I'd buy him some ice cream. So we turned right when they turned left and went to Ben and Jerry's. Peach ice cream in a waffle cone. It was like heaven on earth. And I've never been able to find Ben and Jerry's peach ice cream at any store, but I guess its just one of those things. Whats your favorite ice cream memory?

Alright, enough with the randomness. Always!"

"event","Blah. That is the only way to describe how I feel today. Yesterday I talked to my mom. She said she is sending me a package that should get here Thursday. She's sending me something my godmother gave her when my brother died. She says my godmother was a very ""spiritual"" person and believed that I had a ""special connection"" with angels. My godmother was my mother's aunt. She died when I was pretty young, so I didn't really get to know her to have her explain exactly why it is she thought that. My question is, exactly what is my mother trying to accomplish by sending whatever this is to me? 

Two boys from Harvey High School, a school near where I went to high school, were hit by a train Monday. One of them was killed instantly and the other is in serious condition at the hospital. In 1997, the son of a man who worked with my father was playing chicken with trains and was killed the exact same spot where they were hit. Everybody knows about what happened in Perry with the train. Tragedy causes so much hurt and pain. I think that personal tragedy, versus tragedies like 9/11 or the tsunomi, are much harder to deal with. With things like 9/11, there are so many people going through exactly what you're going through, you will always have someone to turn to. The mother of the son killed in 1997 by the train committed suicide not much later. She ovbiously felt she had no one that could relate to her or help her deal with her grief. 

Last night I woke up in the middle of the night again. It felt like someone was sitting on the side of my bed. It was the strangest feeling. Maybe I was just drowsy from sleeping, but it definetly weirded me out a little.

It sucks, but really what would I be doing on a Monday or Wednesday night? Friends are good, house is good, job is alright (which is saying a lot of a job.) Love life is so-so. Seem to be seeing too much of some people and not enough of others, but what can you do? I wish I had more time to work out, thats my only complaint. I really want to get in shape, not lose weight necassarily, but just tone up a little. I prefer to work out at night when my muscles are a little looser vs working out in the morning when I first get up. Since I like to do a lot of stretching type stuff (yoga, pilates) it doesn't help to have stiff muscles like you have when you first get out of bed. By the time they warm up, the work out is over and you didn't get a lot from it. I'd like to start running, but we all know I hate the gym. Something about touching stuff other people have sweat on grosses me out. Its pretty cold outside though by the time I get home from work, so we'll have to see.

I wasn't feeling real good Saturday night and nothing was really going on, so I didn't go out Saturday night either. Had lunch with some friends Saturday afternoon. Ditto Sunday afternoon. I need to get my eating habits under control. I hate cooking for just one, but eating out all the time is so expensive! Strangely enough, it was always easy to find someone who would come over if you were cooking something. Now its pretty hard to get everybody's schedules arranged. And if you make something that serves more than one, you're eating the left overs for the next week. 

I've been thinking about going to visit my family soon. I don't really want to go back to Ohio until the weather gets a little nicer there.

All in all, other than the situation in my throat, I'm feeling pretty good. In taking this real estate class, I'm realizing how much I don't like being a student.

Every night for the past week I've woken up around 2 o'clock, soaked in sweat feeling like I'm panicing. I think I must be having a nightmare, but I can't remember what its about. Then I can't get back to sleep. I hate taking drugs to help me sleep. Most sleep aides will knock you out for a good eight hours and then you feel tired for the rest of the next day. I can't take something at 2 o'clock thats going to knock me out for eight hours when I have to get up at 6 am. I have a couple of RX pills left from the robbery, but as most people know, I like to hoard my RX medications. 

That maybe a disorder that I seriously need to look into. Whenever I get a RX, for anything, I insist that there be at LEAST one refill and then I will fill the RX, including all refills at as many different pharmecies as it takes. I'm like a crack fien. Its terrible. I never get rid of them either. I have RX from when I was a freshmen. The funny thing is though, that once whatever the RX was written for originally is gone, I will never take those drugs again. Its comforting to me to know that I have them should I ever need them. 

Speaking of disorders, I've been thinking seriously about this thing with me getting involved with unavailable men. Its gotten a little out of hand lately. Its almost like I purposely seek out the most detached men out there. Then I'm surprised and hurt when they turn out to be the way I want them. I think I'm just going to have to stop dating for a while.

No more pop. So long as there's none in front of me. My main concern about resolutions is the word its self. In elementary school we learn that all words have roots. They can have suffixes, prefixes the works. So why is the root of resolutions, solutions. Exactly what are we trying to solve with them? Every year I make the same superficial resolutions. Lose weight, keep sanity. Those two things never go hand in hand. Every seen a sweet tooth thats been deprived of cake for a month? If thats not insanity, I don't know what is. 

So this year I am making some very serious resolutions. I'm going to learn to be the better person. Two years ago I made the same resolution and for that year I rather enjoyed the less cynical, forgive and never forget version of myself. If someone does wrong by me, unless it is something truely horrible, I will learn to move past it. 

I am resolving to make myself less available to unavailable men. I am trapped in a bad dating continium. Constantly I am involved with men who don't want a relationship, don't want a relationship with me, don't have time, don't have money, don't have desire. Enough is enough already. I build up these relationships convincing myself that this is not really happening. Then I am so surprised when the shoe drops. So, thats the end of that.

"event","So I realized today that I haven't written in this thing for a long time. I got some nasty emails from some people about that, I didn't actually think anyone read this honestly. Christmas has come and gone, thank God. I saw my boyfriend today. He had a lot of good things to say. We were making plans for New Year's which I think is going to be a good time. We're going to dress up and he's going to wear a tie to match my dress. How senior prom is that? I love it!

But he did point out something today that I had completely forgotten about. Phil. Tomorrow is the big day, as my boyfriend so affectionatly put it. I don't know how it is that an event that I, that most people that close to me, consider to be the capstone in the most important time of my life thus far could be forgotten. He is gone from my life, forever. And for that I'm grateful. I remember the last time I saw him. He came to Elon and I thought I would die. I was alone in the apppartment and I didn't know what to do. When he knocked at the door, I never thought for one second that he would be on the other side, but there he was. It had been almost three years since the last time I saw him and all he said was, I'm so sorry for everything I did. I just need you to know that. I didn't know at the time what he was thinking. What he was going to do. And part of that leads me back to Mike. 

I use to talk to these groups about suicide. Not about what happens to you, because they all know that. You die. I talked to them about what it does to the people you leave behind. The what ifs, the could've would've should've-s. The last time I saw Mike, in my heart of hearts, I knew what he was going to do. But I didn't want to believe it. Not him, not my best friend. And now everyday I think about the things I would have said, the things I would have done, had I only known what the outcome would be. I would give anything to see him, even just for a couple of minutes, if only to tell him how sorry I am. That I didn't, that I couldn't help him. How sorry I was for hating him that night Phil came after me. For a long time I believed that he should have been there to help me. If it hadn't been for him, Phil never would have had the problems he did. As time goes by I know, if it hadn't been Mike, it would've been something else. And Mike wasn't there, but Rob was. And so I am. 

Anyway, enough emotional baggage for one day. Hopefully I'll remember this thing tomorrow...damn its been a long time.

When you call someone and say, ""Will you let me take you out to dinner?"" Generally that means you are going to pay for dinner. If you call someone and say, ""Lets get some dinner."" That means you're going dutch. At least thats what I thought. Friday night the ""boyfriend"" calls and says let me take you to dinner at Kimbers. Kimbers is a very expensive resturuant in Gibsonville (if you can believe such a place exists). I met him there and by the time I got there, he had ordered, not one, but three appitizers. Shrimp cocktail, oysters, and mushrooms sauteed in barbeque sauce. I can not eat two of those and who wants to eat mushrooms sauteed in barbeque sauce?! So we order dinner, we have a couple of drinks, everything is going really well. Then the waitress asks if we need anything else and we say no, just the check. She says, do you want one check or two? Chris is doing the really weird stare thing and I'm thinking ""Are you serious?! You said you were taking me to dinner?"" So I'm just like...two, thanks. So she puts one and a half of the appitzers on my bill. Now I'm not complaining, because I did have a good time talking to my ""boyfriend,"" but damn, I was not expecting to drop $65 on my dinner Friday night. 

Well Saturday night was Syracuse's going away party. We went to dinner at Top of the Hill in Chapel Hill. No matter what they tell you, the heated patio is not heated. They roll out those nasty kerosine heaters so that have the people are sweating to death and the other half are freezing. We met Syracuse's boyfriend, and he is steller. They are so cute together. She had told us he has this disorder about women paying for stuff. So long story short, he bought all of our dinners. That was out of control and totally unexpected. It was so weird. Nice, but weird. I just don't know what to think about that. Is this normal behavior for men? Or should it be? I hope not, because taking a guy to meet your friends could get really expensive for him. Haha. Anyway, after dinner we went to Goldies for a couple of drinks and then to Players. I do not like Players. I've only been there a couple of times and I almost always get molested by some random. Saturday night was no exception. I was dancing with the girls and this guy comes up and starts just grinding on me. Everybody grinds at the bar, but this was out of control. Then out of no where he shoves his hands down my pants! Now I was wearing pretty tight pants, so I don't even know how he managed it. I was so offended I just pushed him off and turned around and walked away. Again, is this normal behavior for men?

So I think I push men's buttons to see how far they will let me take it. Granted, usually I end up pushing them away. Even though we never dated, my ""boyfriend"" is the only man who's ever caught on to what I was doing and put a stop to it. I don't know what I was doing, but he grabbed my wrist, got right in my face and said ""I know what you're doing Liz and I know why you're doing it. I'm not going to do to you what he did and I don't appreciate you trying to push me into doing it. Now knock it off."" It was such a smack in the face, I hadn't realized that I was doing it. He says he's watched me do it to a lot of men. (Of course he claims he was the only man man enough to tell me to knock it off.)

Thanksgiving and all, thinking about what I'm thankful for. Last year at this time I was not in a good place. I had just been robbed at work, and I wasn't sleeping or eating. That was probably the worst experience of my life. I never really believed that whole life flashing before your eyes thing, but I did after that. Two black men in ski masks robbed me, and after that, as much as I hate it, every black man I saw or anyone in any kind of hat or hooded sweatshirt I was convinced they were going to pull a gun on me. The worst part about that was the fact that my ""boyfriend,"" my best friend, is a black man. Just another reason why I love him though, because he didn't even think anything of it. He had moved to DC at the time and as soon as he heard what had happened, he drove back to stay with me. Good people bring good karma. So this year I'm glad that all of that is over and that I'm safe and I have my friends

A lot of people know that my dad had surgery a couple of weeks ago. They thought he had testicular cancer. My brothers NEVER cry about anything, ever. But they both called me the week of my father's surgery in hesterics. Almost everyone I know knows that religion is a touchy subject for me. God and I didn't exactly get along for a long time. But I found God that week. I don't think I've ever prayed as much as I did that week. Thankfully, Daddy didn't have cancer. So we're grateful for that. 

Ok, finally, my brother is getting married again. He FINALLY got divorced from his henious first wife earlier this year. Now I don't mind saying this, but that bitch was crazy! And she made him miserable. For a long time we thought he had a serious problem with depression. Little did we know her god awful karma was bringing him down. Well, he met a girl that he works with and he is a completely different person. He's so happy. Which is fabulous. 

I'm really happy that my family is safe and healthy and happy this year. (But I still blame George W for all of life's short comings. That is all)

"event","Went to Hilton Head this past weekend for the wedding. The wedding was a good time, but I think the drive down and back was more fun. Chapel Hill and I did a lot of catching up. Not to mention a lot of dicking around. First, we learned a lot about South Carolina. That place is weird! We stopped for dinner and no joke, every single person we saw was wearing camo. Thats certainly a fashion statement. 

Basically I didn't sleep at all this weekend so now I'm exhausted. Friday night when we got to the hotel, I think I basically had an anxiety attack. I'm fully convinced that Hilton Head has horrible karma and I should never ever go there again. Rob met his wife while on spring break in Hilton Head. I haven't really thought much about him for a long time. But when I was there, I had convinced myself that that was the hotel they were in blah blah blah. I don't know what happened. Saturday night after the wedding I was exhausted, but the roommate stayed with us in the hotel and she couldn't sleep so her tossing and turning kept me up. 

I'm ready to go to my parents house to see my family for Thanksgiving. The boys are freaking out, they have called me to remind my mother to tell her that there had better be stuffing and green beans or they are going to mutiny. Thats all I got for today kids!

Always,

Because I really can not imagine what would posses him to talk to me. Don't think you're going to ignore me for three weeks and then I'm going to SUPER excited when you decide you want to ""chill."" Riiiiight.

So Chapel Hill and I are going Hilton Head this weekend for the wedding. It occured to me this morning that I don't know the name of the church or where it is, or the name of the reception hall or where that is. May end up just being a nice weekend in Hilton Head. Haha! So I don't know what time we're leaving, but its going to be a long drive regardless. Not looking forward to that.

My surragate sons birthday is Sunday, but since I'll be in hilton head, I'm going to miss it. But never fear, the gifts have been dropped off. Happy Birthday to the Schween!!

"event","I am a strong believer in karma and what my mother refers to as ""juju."" They're basically the same thing. Basically as long as you are a good person and treat other people good, you're straight. But the minute you mess up, something is bound to happen to you. So, I think I may have offended the universe in some way. I've talked before about men and their spatula routines. I'm usually a pretty forgiving person. Whenever it happens I just sort of brush the dirt of my shoulders and move on. You can't really force a person who doesn't want to be there with you into anything, so what's the point in pushing it? Most of the men who do it aren't worth the effort anyway. I never really let it bother me. But there is one man who just gets under my skin. I don't know what it is about him, he's not doing anything different than any of the other men. I didn't like him anymore than I liked anybody else, but damn even now writing this I'm getting irritated. 

Here's what happened. So I hung out with this guy a couple of times. It wasn't anything serious and I don't really think either of us thought it would be. But he was funny and a good time. Anyway, a little of this a little of that and he drops me like a bad habit. It irked me, but I just brushed it off and moved on. So then last night I see that he's IMed me. First of all, I HATE IM. It is the chicken shit way to do anything. That and text message. If I haven't spoken to you in more than seven days, you had better call me at the very least. I do not accept break ups, apologies or invitations over IM. Grow some balls boys! Seriously. I'm just wondering what this guy wants. Well I'm pretty sure I know what he wants, but I'm also pretty sure he ain't gonna get it.

"event","Last night I had dinner with my ""boyfriend."" Its always good to see him and I love the relationship we have. There's no weird tension between us, at least not for me. We talked about a lot of things, about relationships mostly. Which is really all we ever talk about. He asks about women, I ask about men. Its good. 

Unfortunately I told him about the man I met the other day and he believes that a man in his 30s who is that successful and is not yet married, doesn't want to be and thats sort of scary to me. I'm not saying I'm dying to be married, but it always worries me when men say ""I don't want a relationship."" Who doesn't want to be in a relationship? I can understand statements like, ""I don't want to be in a bad relationship."" or ""I don't want a relationship that is more work than its worth."" But how can you say ""I don't want to be with someone who cares about me and that I care about.""? It just seems unnatural. 

On a side note, I called my match from the 8 minute date and I'd just like to say, an education goes a long way. If I used words bigger than five letters he'd say, ""uh, what does that mean?"" These were not hard words either. For instance, he asked me why I moved to North Carolina and I said, ""Well my relationship with my high school boyfriend was pretty instrumental in that."" To which he replied, ""What did your boyfriend's music have to do with where you went to school?"" And it only went downhill from there. Also, if you don't talk about yourself continually, does that mean you have no personality? A man I use to hang out with, which will remain nameless told a mutual acquintance that I had no personality. When the acquintance asked me about it, believing something must have gone wrong because according to him, ""you have more personality than anyone I know"", I told him that this person a)talked a lot in general and b)talked a lot about himself. All I'm saying is be careful where you point blame.

"event","Yesterday I met the kind of man I want to marry. He's a little older than me, stable, successful. I don't want to tell you too much about him, I don't want to jinx it. People like that make me nervous though. He's doing what he likes to do, he's good at it. I don't like my job but when people ask me what I'd like to be doing, I don't know. Honestly though, I want to be a wife or at least a girlfriend. I just want to take care of a man and have him take care of me. If I could afford it, I would be a stay at home mom. My mom stayed home with us when we were little and I think kids should grow up with their mother at home. My mom always says she was glad to have stayed home with us. 

Also, my match from the 8 minute date called last night. Unfortunately I fell asleep on the couch at 7 and was in my bed sleeping by 9. Who does that, really? So I guess I'll try to call him back tonight. I still want to see that movie The Saw. I tried to see it last night, but nobody wanted to go. So I'm still on the hunt for a date. The roommate's great grandmother died a few days ago and so she's going to the wake tonight and the funeral tomorrow. So I don't know if she's going to be home tonight. Never a good idea to leave me alone in the house.

Picking up the dress for the wedding tomorrow. Its gonna be hot!

"event","This weekend was pretty chill. Friday night the roommate and I decided it was too cold to go out. So we watched a movie. Saturday I went to dinner with Chapel Hill and Syracuse. We went to O'Charley's, which I've decided I don't like. The LITs were ""swell"" though. I should have just loaded up on the rolls because I was pretty wasted by the time we left there. We went to the mall for a hot second, but the Burlington mall is not the hot spot. After the mall we went to the Elon basketball game. I forgot how much fun we use to have there. Chapel Hill and I realized how old we are because we didn't know anybody on the team. Jack Attack, Ankle Biter, Big Scottie and the Protege were still there, but we didn't know anybody else. So sad!

Chapel Hill ended up coming back to my place a little later. We had a lot of girl talk. Mostly about men. Which we decided two things. One, men are just rude and two, men don't know how to compliment women. Here's a little note to men. If a woman calls you and wants to hang out, but you're ""busy"" or you just don't want to. Just answer the phone and say, ""I already have plans."" Also, be careful with your compliments. Telling a woman she has ""a fat ass"" is not a compliment. To anyone! Also, do not compliment on the way she shaves her pubic hair. Eyes and smiles are cheesey compliments if not executed in the right way/moment. You want to compliment a woman? Here's some ideas: Instead of saying ""You have a nice smile."" or ""You have pretty eyes."" Say, ""I like the way your eyes shine when you laugh."" That was one of the greatest compliments I ever got. A compliment that comes across with some thought and seems genuine is a lot better than some cheesey crap line. 

Lots going on this week. Picking up the dress for the wedding on Wednesday. Leaving for the wedding Friday! Should be a good time.

"event","As promised, The Family has issued the following memo for consideration.



Do to the recent increase in occurances, the family would like to take this opportunity to displace some societal miscommunications, specifically in terms of sexual practices. In terms of heterosexual relationships (between a man and a woman)this organization respectfully requests that any form of anal <here in after refered to as ""the area""> interaction come to an immediate halt. 

Great consideration of both psychological and physiological implications has been taken into account. Recent studies conducted of the members of this organization have found that women believe men who posses a certain ""anal fixation"" may in fact be demonstrating underlying homosexual tendancies and would be better served in an atmosphere more conducive to their prefrences. Women are generally greatly uncomfortable with this form of interaction, often believing that some form of embarassement may result from it. 

Members of both genders can apprciate the need for strict sexual hyigene. The placement of any object or bodily apendage within ""the area"" and then replacement in the proper place can result in any number of uncomfortable infections or bacterial unbalances for women. Ms. Sycracuse would like to mention that there are other hygenic practices that follow this same idea. For both genders, Ms. Durham informs this organization, such interaction can result in a condition called ""dookie finger."" For more information on this condition, please contact Ms. Durham personally. 

Finally, but most importantly, the members of this organization, while understanding to the appeal to men for actual intercourse via ""the area"", would like it known that no form of any interaction with ""the area"" in no way stimulates or excites women. 

Thank you for your time."

Definetly a night to remember, though I'm slowly realizing I may not be remembering it in the right order. So last night Chapel Hill and I went to the 8 minute date. I practically had to drag her into it kicking and screaming. But we ended up having a really great time. There were all kinds of people there, which was great. Highlight of that portion of the night has to be tie between either the 'smooth operator' and his coolness line or the drunk old guy during the mingle session. 

Then Chapel Hill and I came home to pick up the rest of the family to go to Poppi's show. A little shout out to Poppi here - so about that going on at 11:15 thing? Riiiiight. All night long I was pounding drinks like it was my job. Now, Poppi has this friend who the family affectionately refers to as the beanpole because he is the tallest man I've ever met. I saw him out Friday and Saturday this past weekend and I figured I'd see him last night. Well he kept buying me beers on top of the drinks Chapel Hill was buying me, needless to say, by the time Poppi went on, I was hammered. But I got to shake it like I own it, which is always a good time. 

Unfortunately for me though, after getting home at 3, going to bed at 4 and the alarm going off at 5:30, I won't be going to work today. At least not before lunch. I don't know that I can afford to take a whole day off, so I might have to suck it up and go in this afternoon. We'll see.

Always recooperating,

"event","So finally I saw the Protege last night. I decided I was going to quit acting like the old fart I've become and stay up to see him. I like hanging out with men with personality and a sense of humor. I reminds me a lot of Rob, just minus the cheating asshole bastard parts of Rob's personality. Never underestimate the value of conversation and laughter. Anybody who can laugh at the genital herpes commerical while kissing a girl is down in my book. Granted, I'm quickly learning that staying up that late the night before the longest day of the week is a bad idea, but it was worth it.

So, now onto my busy day. Work all day, which we all know the only energy I put forth there is to keep my eyes open. Then tonight Chapel Hill and I are going on the 8 minute date. For two hours, we will meet a new man every 8 minutes. At the end of the night everybody writes down the names of the people they'd like to get to know better. If there are any matches, they give you each other's contact information. The roommate has been making fun of us, asking ""Do you know what kind of people go to those things?"" Whatcha trying to say roomie? Haha. Poppi has a show tonight, so I think we're going to try to make an appearence there.

One final side note, I know I mentioned my need to be in a relationship earlier. Now I know the Protege is younger and most likely interested in a relationship. I'm not even saying I want a relationship with him per say, but someone like him. Funny, very chill...just cool to hang out with. Well thats all I got for today.

Always,

"event","Something very karmic is going on here, and I can't decide if its good karma or bad karma. Friday night, the roommate and I are getting ready to go out and I get a text message from the Protege. The Protege and I hung out last year for awhile, but our age difference wasn't working to our advantage (He was a freshmen, I was a senior). A little ""The Graduate"" -esque, but younger men are definetly hot. Basically we talked about hanging out again, but he was in Virginia for the weekend. The roommate and I went to Heaven Friday night. Even though it was just the two of us, I had the most fun I've had in a while. The roommate got absolutely TRASHED. The Kid was there, women hanging all over him like usual. The whole drive home she spent reassuring me that I was much prettier than those girls who were f-ugly. As she started to pass out, she would just randomly blurt out ""yeah...f-ugly."" Too funny! Even though the situation with the Kid and I is over in my eyes and he can do as he pleases, its still funny to see how people will act around people they use to hang out with.

Then Saturday night the Mormon calls. The Mormon has to be the funniest dating situation I've ever been in. He came knocking at my door the day I moved into the townhouse and sold me a security system. The first night I had a house warming party with everybody and I invited him over. I noticed he wasn't drinking or swearing and he seemed really uncomfortable anytime anything sexual came up. And you know how sometimes when you're drinking you have a sudden instance of genius? I was just like...OHMIGOD! You're Mormon! I have to say, that was probably the only time in my life a man has just been like, ""and I'm not sleeping with you. Ever."" The sad thing was, he was probably the most beautiful man I've ever seen. So depressing. 

So basically I'm wondering is it a good thing or a bad thing that these past flames are calling? And what about the fact that I couldn't actually see any of them? I think my real problem is that after being single for almost two years and loving it, I'm ready to be in love again. I want the security in a relationship. Is THAT bad?

"event","Does this story make me a snot? So I went to the Greensboro library last night. Walking from the parking garage to the library, I saw some sketchy people hanging around outside. When I got inside, I went upstairs to the none fiction section. As I'm looking for the books I want, I notice these two guys with walking sticks and lots of walmart bags sitting in the chairs up there. It was ovbious they were homeless. Now I feel bad for them because I know its starting to get cold outside, but it sketched me out. I don't want sketchy people hanging out in the library. Is that bad?

Ok, moving on to the important stuff. First, I DO NOT look cute today. Not even a little. I woke up this morning and was like, I'm not even going to try. First of all, it was freezing in my house. The thought of washing my hair just made me feel sick. It was too cold to be walking around the house with wet hair. So I didn't wash my hair, but in my own defense, people who color their hair as much as I do aren't suppose to wash their hair a lot because it makes the color fade. And I will wash it tonight before I go out. So the hair ended up on top of my head in what my father calls the ballerina look. A mess on top of my head and an elastic head band to keep it there (its too thick to stay there by itself). I'm also wearing the closest thing to sweatpants I can wear to work and get away with. But on a side note, I have cute shoes on. Four inch mary janes. They're cute. 

Not sure what I'm going to be doing this weekend. My surragate son is coming to town. Too cute! Its starting to get too cold to be dressed cute at the bar. Thats depressing. You just don't feel as cute in bulky sweaters and boots. I'm not saying you can't be cute, just not as cute as you look in the little strappy dress you'd wear in July. Well I guess thats all for now kids. Have a good weekend, be safe, have fun!

A couple of weeks ago my roommate and I threw a bridal shower for the bride. It took her weeks to get us the list of people she wanted us to invite to the shower. The list had about 60 people on it. Well, first we had to narrow that list down to about 30 people. Then we send the invitations and only 5 people show up. FIVE! Well after the shower, the bride said some pretty ugly things about a friend of mine. Needless to say, I don't care for the bride. Last night the bride and the roommate go shopping for make-up for the wedding. My roommate comes home in tears because the bride was cutting her down all night and just being stupid. Why do people have to be so henous to each other? Especially to people they consider their friends?

So moving on to the good people. Maybe good isn't exactly the right word. I've really come to admire a couple people in my life who, on top of being a good person, are really good at what they do. I was hanging out with this guy, Poppi, for awhile. He was a funny guy. Not funny like haha funny, but I guess funny because he was SO different from me. He was an artist, in a lot of different senses of the word. But particularly music and design. Everything he ever showed me that he did, I just couldn't believe it. Though I don't know a lot about the type of music he does, anyone who knows me knows I studied classical music my whole life, you could just tell he knew what he was doing. I wish I could give you some examples, but that would give away his real identity. (HAHA) Anyway, we don't really hang out much anymore, which is mostly my fault. He put up with a lot of shit from me, or well mostly stupid behavior, but I feel like anyone that tolerates half the shit I do, is a good person. 

You know what question I hate? When people ask you, ""So what do you want to do?"" In reference to my career. Cause you know what? I don't know what I want to do. And I have a lot of respect for the people who have found something they love and are really good at it. The Kid, he is so meant for the job he is doing. He's definetly the goofiest guy I've ever met, even writing this I'm laughing. I'm not going to tell you how I met him because its WAY too embarassing, but even that story fits him. He just has the best personality.

Basically today I'm saying I love good people and as for you mean bitches, get a life! :)

"event","Disclaimer: I've decided that in the interest of all parties involved, if I talk about anything personal in here, I'm not going to call people by their real names but to call them by their nicknames. Most of these people already know their nicknames or can figure out who they are if they read this, but no one else will know who they are. 

I had lunch yesterday with my ""boyfriend."" We had a really long discussion about my dating life. Which seemed to be a hot topic yesterday. But more on that later. So anyway, he had asked if I was dating, how it was going blah blah. And I filled him in on the recents minus a few details. I told him about the spatula routines I've been getting and here's what he said about the situation. He said that I have some ""quirks"" that sometimes can freak guys out. He talked about the fact that I have my fridge set so cold that bottles of water freeze in the fridge part but that I still put ice in a glass of milk because 'it's not cold enough.' But does the fact that I put ice in my milk make me undatable? But he agreed that I am the kind of girl every guy SAYS he wants, but then when he actually gets it, he's a little weirded out.

Second issue from yesterday. I had a fight, I think, with one of my best friends. There were a lot of things brought up from our weekend activities to dating. But my biggest pet peeve about the whole situation was the inappropriate use of pronouns. Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""I"". And don't say ""you"" in the plural form when you mean ""You"" singular. I felt like I was being ganged up on, which she claims I wasn't, because she kept refering to ""we"" as in her and her roommate. Her roommate is a friend of mine also, who I talk to almost everyday and she has never said anything about it. I just wish that if people had an issue, they would talk to me, instead of this ""we"", ""I"", ""you"" bullshit. 

Ok, third and finally, I have decided that I hate the word busy. It should be eriadicated from the english language. Busy has apparently become sinonimous with uninterested. And I'm not claiming that men use it singularly, because I've pulled the busy line too. ""Sorry I didn't call you last week, I was busy."" Translated into real english ""I didn't call you last week, I was uninterested."" Don't say sorry, because you're not. And don't say busy because NO ONE is that busy. I realize that pretty much everyone has a lot of engagements in their lives, but if you are truely interested, try harder. We are all still reasonably young, we can work it out. Thats all I'm saying.

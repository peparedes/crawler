"event","ya a pasado mucho tiempo desde la ultima vez que escribi en este diaro. no puedo ecribir en papel porque algunos de mis soeurs o freres podrian obtenerlo y leerlo. muchas cosas han pasado en los ultimos meses. creia que queria salir con una chica pero en realidad no pude hacer una decision. tengo sentimientos por dos muchachas pero no sabia que hacer. incluso mis copains hacen la vida plus aterrorada. uno dice que voy a querer a la que el dice y el otro quiere que me haga la otra de novia al azar. ya no puedo parle con la que era mi meyor amie. a veces nos reunimos juntos para hablar pero desde vendredi ha dicho que ya no nos podremos mirar asi. afortunadamente mi mejor amiga ya ha llegada a visitarme y podre hablar con ella. pero lamento que no sera sufficiente nuestra relacion a cambiado mucho y todo fue mi culpa. toda via no se lo que mas pueda pasar se que mis mejores copains estan en relacionnes unas mas fisicamente intimas que otras preo la verdad es que ya no tengo en algien con quien puedo confiar. estoy tout seul. con la exepcion de mi amiga alma con quien confio mas cada jour. pues hasta luego y vallan con Dios.

"event","i am really sorry i was mad at GOD for me losing my best friend. i was just too ignorant to realize that all i had to do was talk to him. my best friend was like a brother to me. i loved him as i did any other person of my family and when he fell in love i was happy for him but soon he was dumped and totally distruaght. he kept alienating himself and i just feel so bad because i felt like i just never reached out to him. i talkedc to him but it was just dificult. i felt like he thought i had betrayed him but it was really that he needed to be reached out to. then today i got to talk to him and now i will hopefully make plans and we can do something together. i just ask god ythat he forgive me for not letting him just take care of my situaton. if i had put more faith in him it would have gone much better. i know i would have been able to think with a clearer mind. but i just cannot explaine just how happy i am."

"event","well it has been quite a while since i have last written so i thought i might talk about what has been happening in the past few weeks. well now i must start out by saying i finally told Nikki how i felt about her even though i knew she probably didn't feel the same way about me. nevertheless i told her how i felt and was obviously shot down but this was the first time that i had ever had that happen to me. i guess since i expected to be shot down i was not dissapointed when it actually happened. anyway since i have movedd on and went on my next little avdenture and i went to a winter retreat with my church. it ws the first time i had ever seen snoww and i was just so full of excitement. i had the opportunity to go thanks to my youth minister Jaymes who is the best youth minister ever. without him i might have not been able to go. i played in the snow sang laughed spent one on one with myself and my lord in the mountain and came back refreshed, inspired and just ever so full of Gods undying love. now by this time track had also started and today i played in my frist intersquad meet but i was sadly taken down by some awsome throwers Jay and matt and brent. i took second place in my best event and took third in the shot put. i was dissappointewd but i at least now have opponents to beat on my team and once i have surpassed them i can defeat my opponents in the league. well that is all i have to say and i must now get to work and really just be better than i am now in all aspects of my life and with the help of my lord Jesus the holy spirit and god our father i know i can succeed after all if God is with us who can stand against us."

"event","Well today after a long day of work i arrived home and began to eat my dinner sinc i had not taken a break all day becuase i had so many things that had to get done. And my father asks did you bring an extra hot dog i said no you guys went somewhere else and i did not expect you guys here. and so i began eating than he starts with ""You little fucken asshole son of a bitch good for nothing bastard"". so i ignorre him and continue eating when he Continues: miserable, hijos de puta"". then he says i Hate people like you bastard son of a bitch. i i contained my anger but now i was faming mad. i did not answer but let him leave the room and i sat on the sofa. the i walks into the room again and says for the second time in my lifetime that he does not want me to count on him ever for the rest of my life. But now he mentioned:"" as soon as you turn 18 you can leave for all i care actually leave i dont care and never come back and when i die i dont even want you to come to my funeral you pathetic hypocrit. i dont want hypocrits in my house and i tell you this because i dont care if you leave or what happens to you. you think you can make it on your own without depending on someone else leave as soon as it is your 18 birthday just get out you son of a horror"" during all this verbal abuse i just looked away sternly and took it in silence. this is the only time i looked away and just took it as it came at me because i know  had i looked at him i would have started to fight back with that friggen poor excuse for a father. to think that i am even related to that man makes my blood boil. to many times throughout my childhood he has treated me like this and this is the only time i actually just took each and every word into my braine. I find it so Hard to cope with the commandment of God that says though shall honor thy mother and thy father. but what is there to honor about him. my mom was alone in mexico when i was born and he was stuck in jail.i do whatever possible to make his life easier and forgive him time and time again and he keeps abusing me. i dont understand what god wants me to do with this. all i can think of is that i have to start opreparing for when i must move out. i dont care where i go i just guess he is right he doesn't want me in his life and i just can't stand having him keep making me feel like bloody shit all the damn time. it is just not fair.but i have no place to go really go. i feel like i have been backed into a corner with no esxcape and i am just gettibng desperate. this time my own mother was in the sam eroom when she heard half of the damn crap he was saying and she did not once open her mouth to say something. it is a time like this that makes me question why is it worth living if you dont have a home to belong to and infuriates me because i have to put up[ with so much bullshit."

"event","well it has been another day and i just plain did not like that i had to work most of the day on new years eve it is times like these that i feel like i am being taken advantage of. i work holidays i dont get paid time and a half and i am stuck with some people feeling sorry for me. but at other times i am glad that i have a job that is so incredibly flexible with my hectic schedule some times. i am also having problems like in relationships wise. i like somone but i like someone else and then i wonder do i even have feelings fopr the person i want to ask this girl; out but it just seems so difficult since i am almost positivre she may say no but she is deffinitely not out of my league. i think i have a very good chqnce but maybe it is just my insicurity and the words of another friend that just keep ringing in my head. and another friend wrote what i think is very true about how i feel and she wrote this in one of her poems    

For me depression is the love, 
the love that I can't have,
the love that's just beyond my reach, 
the love that drives me mad.

My name is Santiago but some people juist call me Santo, Santi, or Sebastian
I am in high school and I am involved in Track and Field, Hip Hop, Deance etc.

I am a pretty easy going guy Religious, and very friendly. Tall. play violin.

"event","while all of you are dancing the night away at prom, i am balling my eyes out, so let me explain.Let me go back in time at like 2day at noon, when i was putting my furniture back into the house that was in the garage.So i opened the garage door, and as i kept walking back and forth from the garage and the house i had noticed this little black bird sitting next to my sisters car. I  didn't think anything of it, but why was is it just sitting there, and not out flying? So, then i went inside, then came back out, and the same bird was sitting on the edge of this basket that was in my garage. I was like aww, it's cute, so then i went up to the bird,but he didn't move, so i went on taking in the furniture. Time went on ,and around like 4 i went out again to take my dog out , and the bird was sitting by my front door, and i was like hey, thats funny. So then another couple hours go by, and i go outside ,and see the bird hoping across my drive way, and i was like wow, that bird has been here all day, so i went outside to see what was up, and when i got close enough, i saw that the bird was hurt. It looked like his right leg was hurt, and he couldn't fly, but just hobble his way along.  I had called my dad to see what to do because i didn't the little bird to die, so my dad said to keep a eye on him, and wait til he got home.  I went back outside ,and manuvered the bird into this basket thing, and put him in our garage.I also put a piece of bread in there so he could eat.  So i went inside a little while to watch th o.c., and i heard somthing like fall or something, so i went to check on the bird. By that time i had named him Dusty because well, he looked all dusty from the sand he was sitting in. So i looked at him, and he was like head first into the corner of the basket, and i knew it, and my eyes started to swell, and i petted his head, and he didn't move... that was it. It was all downhill from there. I know i shouldn't have cried, but i helped this poor little creature, and i watched him suffur, and i couldn't do anything about it, i watched him die. He was so helpless, and i felt as if i could have done more, but i just sat there saying "" you can make it, you can get up, and i just saw his head drop, and he died.  That is an expierence i never want to go through again. It was only a bird, and i cried my eyes out, jeeze, im a stupid girl. But then it started to remind me of m mom dieing, and i couldn't help,all i could do was watch her slowly die.  So, i had to cry again, and look at pictures, and i am so sad right now. I just need to get out of my house, but i have no one to go to because who i want to talk to is busy having fun at prom, and all i need is someone to talk to.And all i can do is watch the time go by, cause i'll never be able to go to bed, you can forget that. Anyways, my macoroni is done, so im going go eat dinner,until next time...  

 I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing"

"event","Ok, well, let me start by saying im in the library with nothing ot do bc my class is on a field trip, and my father got me out of going. I would be on a bus going to St. Petersberg, but once again, im stuck in naples,yea! I would also be on aim talking to Jess,(sry)this dumb computer doesn't have aim on it, and im UPSET!,lol, cause i have no one to talk to but the librian, but thats ok. It's so quite in here, i don't know what to do, but anyways. Yeah, this weekend was fun, on Sun. Jess helped me clean my car, well, i freebreezed it ,lol, it works great. For some reason, my dad isn't proud of my truck, but i like it, it is my practice car yes that means we can mess it up Jess. But no holes in the roof this time,lol. So i just saw three gansters walk by the door, What up G- Unit! I might get shot if i say this, but it is naples. I really wish i was at home sleeping right now, cause these cramps aren't working out for me,nope! There's all this art in here, and i was looking at it, and all i have to say is that there is alot of really freaky people. So i think that me dad is going to get rid of the really awesome rental car , because it was due back like on Sat. and he didn't return it. So he told me that he was going to get the titles to his van and he was going to drive that around. I told him there was no way i was going to drive around a Scooby Doo van, but whatever. Speaking of my father, he didn't come home last night, or this morning, so when i called him this morning to drive me to the stop he didn't pick up his phone, i was really mad. On a happy note,um, i forgot what i was going to say, but that im in a room filled with geeks, i feel out of place. They acually want to come here and read, but hey good for them. Ok, so that was a waste of an entry, but o well, i have nothing else to do, so until next time ..."

"event","Well, i just got done reading Jess's journal , and i was going to write bout spring break, but she basically said it all, and if your friends with her, then i bet you already read it, lol. But i do have some more stuff that i could tell all you. I'm sure all of you are tired of me saying that i'm hungry, but im sry, i just haven't ever gone a day without eating, and if you know me, i LOVE to eat, so it was a pretty big day for me, and not one of the best. I just want to go to bed, but I'm not quite tired yet, but hey, no school for me 2morrow, yea!!Lets see, that's all that has been happening with me, but that i drove to my bus stop this morning ,and no i didn't hit any predestrains on the way, Damn,lol, just kidding!! I like the kid who rides the bike. Anyways, this rental car my dad has is so awesome ,and i got to drive it twice, and i don't want him to get rid of it, but one day he will have too, ::tear::. Hmm, i think spring break could have gone on a little longer, im not rested yet, well at least my stomach doens't hurt any more from when i fell on the shopping cart at Publix. At least i have summer to look forward too, even thought i have nothing planned, but maybe i'll get to re- do my room like my dad said i could. Well, i don't want to re- do it when in like 4 years my dad is selling the house, and maybe he'll finally buy his condo on the beach like he's been talking aobut.  Yeah, i wouldn't mind one bit, but it would be strange not having a back yard, and umm some privacy. O well, i'll get over it, hopefully i'll be in college when all this happends so i don't sad when he  moves all our crap out of the house. I have been living there since i was 3, and hell, there are so many memories in that house,good, the bad and the ugly! I'm  going to miss this old house. Enough reminsing, untill next time ..."

"event","i didn't have much to say, so here are some quotes that i like...


Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes hasten to their end. ~ Shakespeare 
  ~~ He's freaking awesome, and he's my favorite arthor, and i really like the beach.

Its when we allow others to think for us, that the whole world suffers 
  ~~ I believe in that so much, you got to think for your self, but sometimes it's ok to listen what other people have to say.

Your dream starts as soon as you wake up.
 ~~ That's true because your dream won't come true unless you get up and do somthing about it.

We could all take a lesson from crayons: Some are sharp, some are beautiful, some have weird names, all are different colors; but they all have to learn to live in the same box. 
 ~~Yeah, i thought this one was cute.

Time is the best teacher; unfortunately it kills all of its students
 ~~People take so much time, and wste it cause they think time will always be on their side, but one day your just going to die.

Try to see if you're perfect, then change your name to nobody. 
 ~~ No one's perfect and if you think you are, you got another thing comming!

30 years from now its not going to matter what shoes you wore, how your hair looked, or the pair of jeans you bought. What will matter is what you learned and how it helped you to get where you are...
 ~~ What we do now, really won't matter in the future, materials ,i mean. The friends we have the love we think we feel, those do matter in the future, they help you make the person you are in the future.

What if finding the love of your life meant changing the life that you love
 ~~ They always say, you would do anything for love, but i don't think you should have to change your whole life for someone, but hey, i might be wrong.



Until Next Time ..."

On the other hand i got an 80 on my science midterm, so that's a little better. Yeah, and today i got to do my schedulying for next year, and i got to pick alot of clases, but i picked for my electives ( tv. production, early childhood 2, beg. aerobics, and beg. tennis) yeah sounds weriod, but i wanted to get back into shape,lol.

It was so awesome, i want it to come back, but it was fun. riding the bumper cars w/freaks, talking to a carnie, and EATING!! But i do have to say it did get pretty cold out, but the music was good. Even got to see some Gulf Coast blood. Then Sunday came, and i ate out all day with my father, it was the most i saw him all weekend. For breakfast we went to cracker barrel ,and it was good, then for dinner we went to T.G.I. Fridays. We had Monday off, so i watched movies all day, and layed in the sun, nice and relaxing! Yeah, i had the whole house to my self literally all day. From 7 in the morning, to 8 at night. My dad came home for 40 minutes, and then he left again, i was pretty upset. Anyway, SPRING BREAK is only 5 DAYS AWAY!!!!!!! I can't wait for that, i think everyone needs a vacation form everyone, and should hang out with the sun,water,food, and music, and of course family, because i really need that vacation, eventhough my family doesn't do that, o wait they never have time. But over spring break  my kitchen, dinning room,living room and laundry room is all getting new tile, well wood isn't a tile but whatever. So that should be interesting. O yeah, and im going to the doctor over vacation,( sure you all needed to know that,lol) Im going to the ---->, lol, ( Jess & Ashley) Good times, Good times! I think that's all  i really have to say but i need to go cd shopping, i haven't bought a cd in like a month, now that's just a sin,lol.

In my science class i was an assistant( i held up a poster board) and it was so much fun. I don't know why it ws so much fun, but that class puts me in a mood, and it's freaking awseome!! Like my englich class last semester, i coluld just say something ,and people would laugh, but in my science class it't the same way, but even better! The people i sit by are so funny, and well you have to be there. Omg, then don't even get me started on my 3rd block, it's soooo much fun.I acually like my math class too, when we have free time, it's cool, cause the girl who sits next to me we talk about clothes, and earlychild hood class, and it's fun. OMG, yeah, i got an 85 baby on my last math test. When i got it back, i just started freaking out , and i was so excited, and everyone around me was like "" What""?, but they went along with it. You know this cereal Kix, it's freaking aweosome, i've almost eaten the whole box, and I can'r put it down. Thought you should know that. It's my favorite cereal!!This weather can soo go away now, I mean come on, it's florida for sake, where's the sun?!?! But it's ok. alittle change is ok, but i've had enough!! 3 days til I see Craig Morgan!!!! I can't wait, "" What I Love about Sunday!!!!"" Best song ever.

"event","Well, this weekend takes home the award, "" Waste of my 2 freaking days "" award!!! You know, it;s useless for me to even have a weekend, cause i don't do anything,i might as well get a job, cause im tried of staying home alone, and having no to talk to, or any thing to do!!!!!!!! Let's see Friday night, i went to golden gate city, and had dinner, and i freaking spilled spagetti sauce all over me,and dropped hot noodles on my lap. Then these stupid girls were standing right in front of me,so i had their butts right in my face, and if i looked the other way , there was a mirror, so either way i was screwed!!Well, Saturday sucked a big one, my fmaily left in the wee hours of the morning, and i was left to watch the house as usual, and nothing to watch on tv. Then saturday night, my dad came home late, then went out. Oh, how I just love waking up to an empty house. My dad didn't come home,and we had to be in fort myers at 11, and we got there at 11:15. Yeah, and this stupid thing i had to go to for colloege finacial aid thing, i had to listen to this girl talk for about 2 hours, and i wasn't even listening, i was watching this dumb girl in front of me play with her hair,it was so annoying. The hotel was so cold, but they had a really cool bathroom, anyways, so we got out at like 1, and went out to eat at Outback. I haven't eaten there in like a year, last time i hd their food i was with Amanda. So of course i got me a huge steak ,and our waiter was so cute, and he had a slight southern accent, it ws so cute. He really wanted me to order desert, but i ate my whole steak ,and i was really full,i felt bad. So now, im waitng for my dad to come back inside so then we can go to the new SweetBay place, and get food, ooo, I can't wait! Damnit, and there is still freaking testing tomorrow, jeeze, i think im going to go crazy!!!!! I need help, i need to get out of here!!!!!!!!

"event","This morning, I had missed the bus because of my so called ""father figure"", beacause he wouldn't get up. So when we got to the end all I had to say was ""I told youuuuuu!!!""But anyways, so it was dead silent in the car on the way to skool, besides the radio. I thought wow, what a perfect way to start the freaking day, that means it's going ot be a bad day.And for the first block it was. For one, it was like all cold and stuff ,and thought that it was going to be rainy all day. But I so didn't want ot be in Spanish class, so I did nothing all block. Then 2nd block came and changed my whole day, it was soooooo much fun. Eventhough we had a quiz, (which i didn't study for), but we watched this video that the teacher made with his two kids, and they're so funny. Oh, oh, and then the lock down was the best part of the WHOLE day!! It was so much fun, I sat on the floor and talked to my friends and we were laughing the whole time, and some people were being gay, but for the most part it was F-U-N!Then don't even get me started on 3rd  block. The kids in that class are so funny, and i have never laughed so hard in my life before.  Omg, Corbett, I'm so seeing you in hell,lol!! Next came lunch, and when food is involed, it's all good. LOL, In 4th block i had the whole block to do whatever I wanted, so I left and did my science homework, so now I have no homework , YEA!! Now, im typing this all up, and thinkning wow, another freaking fri. and no plans, no plans for the whole weekend, now that's just a freraking outrage!! But my dad will be home on Sun. so that means i won't go out til like 5 in the after noon, man i HATE that!! But o well, spring break is comming, and all im doing is laying in the sun, and shopping!!Unless by some mmircale, my dad takes me somewhere, but I have nothing to worry bout. Here is a little song to  ease into the weekend....



Raymond's in his Sunday best,
He's usually up to his chest in oil an' grease.
There's the Martin's walkin' in,
With that mean little freckle-faced kid,
Who broke a window last week.
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me. 

That's what I love about Sunday:
Sing along as the choir sways;
Every verse of Amazin' Grace,
An' then we shake the Preacher's hand.
Go home, into your blue jeans;
Have some chicken an' some baked beans.
Pick a back yard football team,
Nothin' much of anything:
That's what I love about Sunday. 

I stroll to the end of the drive,
Pick up the Sunday Times, grab my coffee cup.
It looks like Sally an' Ron, finally tied the knot,
Well, it's about time.
It's 35 cents off a ground round,
Baby. cut that coupon out! 

That's what I love about Sunday:
Cat-napping on the porch swing;
You curled up next to me,
The smell of jasmine wakes us up.
Take a walk down a back road,
Tackle box and a cane pole;
Carve our names in that white oak,
An' steal a kiss as the sun fades,
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah. 

Ooh, new believers gettin' baptized,
Momma's hands raised up high,
Havin' a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face.
That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah. 

That's what I love about Sunday,
Oh, yeah."

Anway, today was interesting, the first day of FCAT, yipp ee!! But w/e you got to do it right, well, untilk next year, then im done. And of course by this time next year I'll be driving, and I can come in late, like today lol. You know, i think that im really confused on something, but i don't know what it is exactly. I want to do someting in spite of what someone tells you to do. Yeah you could call that not listening, and doing what you want, but i forgot what I was trying to say. Maybe it'll come back later. This weekend better be sunny out, cause I SOOOOOO want to go the beach, you have like no idea. But if that plan fails, i'll just lay out by my pool, since on sunday  i have to up at the crack of dawn and be in fort myers for this college thing my dad is taking me to. But yeah, im not very um hyper right now, im kinda tired, and don't want to do gay testing tomorrow, but what's a girl to do? I know, SHOP!!, lol, yeah 2morrow i have to present to my science class, which won't be that bad , since im not the dombest one in there, thank god. You know what i think PRHS needs to do? they need to draft hot boys in that can dress good, have a car(maybe a job), and aren't so gay like the ones here. It's a freaking outrage that isn't like more cute boys here, i mean come on,you gotta have some eye cand right? But , i'll live with the ones that we have, it was just a thought. I must go for now, ~ mallory"

Locker number 1921 is now home to a fat spider. I saw it crawl into my locker a few days ago. I thought it would have left but of course not. Everytime I got to open my locker it's just chillen there. I tried to kill it twice today with no luck. One of us is movin out..I have a feeling it's not gunna be the spider. It's probably laying baby spiders inbetween my books. Maybe I should give him a name.. 

I think Jeff's right, whereever I go, spiders follow. There are always spiders in his car when I'm in it. ..that can possibly be a good thing.

-Never demand a serious relationship early on -- and never try to be the only thing in your Aquarius' universe. They need space to explore, and time to devote to the world at large.

-Try not to lure an Aquarius into your arms when their mind is elsewhere. They may turn down the invitation. Worse, they might not even notice that you gave it. 

-Keep yourself at a safe distance emotionally, at least at first. Aquarius is a detached Sign in some ways, and Aquarians need space to be happy.

"event","I took PSATs this morning at 8 oclock. I never want to wake up at 730 on a Saturday again. Each section is 25 minutes, at the end of one section the proctor decides to leave the room. Some other guy comes in and doesn't even know that we only had 5 minutes left, so we sat there for 50 minutes until someone said...yeah I've got places to go..we've been sitting here 25 minutes over the time. I better get higher than a 980 this time.

My weekend was suppost to consist of me sitting at home everynight, working on my two essays. That plan went out the window... I can't write anything to save my life. 500 words may not seem like alot, but I've only got the intro done, and now I've got..writers block. hah I laugh...This isn't happening. I'll do it Monday morning.

I rented that movie that someone was talking about, Momento. I ended up getting the one with spanish subtitles...."

"event","Tonight to say the least...was strange. 
First, I went to my schools homecoming game. Of course we lost. I think I got called a slut a few times from the sophomores. Remind me again why I was at a football game?....

Then I went to a pizza place with like 7 people that I don't hang out w/ besides Brittany and Carlee. We ended up sitting on Pauls car in a Publix parking lot waiting for <b><I>someone</I></B>to come for like an hour. Then we went to Shawns house.. I haven't talked to since like elementary school, I really don't even know if I talked to him then... With a bunch of Nova kids. I don't know how people can tolerate the girls that go to my school, they all bring on drama.

Paul's a cool kid. It's funny, Carlee talked to him more than I did. In math class I had a migraine and couldn't really look up because of the lights. I kept asking people if they had aspirin, but noone did. Whenever someone walked down the hall, Paul would jump up and ask them if they had some.....how cute. Today was just strange. I can't explain it anymore.

over and out, captain."

Every person on the shirts were black, not that there's anything wrong with that...but where are the white kids at. Her idea for our class shirts was an Escalade running over a senior, with the kid in the drivers seat sticking his hand out the window with 4 fingers in the air. Brittany goes ""I don't know about you, but I'm not ghetto. If we're gunna do that..at least make it a BMW.""

This night is going by realllly slow. I was watching making the video with Christina Aguilara er however you spell it. I used to think she was one ugly rat faced slut, but there's something about her now that makes her hott.. maybe it's the fake tan, massive black eyeliner and the labret piercing. who knows.


I think I have a.d.d when it comes to history, for some reason I remember saying this before. maybe because I say it all the time. I seriously can't read anything from that book and remember what I just read. I've read section at least 3 times since the beginning of the week and I still don't know what the chapter is even about. Who needs to learn history anyway.

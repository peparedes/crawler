the dude that i ussualy like to wait on me loves death metal. you wouldnt think it looking at em, but he likes nile alot, amoungst alot of swedish death bands that will blister ur brain. wierd huh?

speaking of which im making blast beats with my drum machine trying to play grindcore/death metal/black metal, but it is SO hard to do right, u need to keep it simple and brutal yet technical enough to make people say ""wow"" and it has to be absolutly flawless and continuous 16th notes at around 215 bpm... and also im playing it all in E, or A harmonic minor so its hard to regulate it all."

music is the greatest form of human expression.

gene even showed his face at hildys after work (genes my brother for those not knowing) and bought me a pint of guinness. dereks friends who never met me bought me shots, it was dollar shots night at hildys but it still meant alot to me. not alot of people are as appreciative as me (Im not gloating, please dont mistake me) and people arent used to such honesty but each of thier dollars bought them more then they could imagine... and yes i know its customary on the big two-one to buy one drinks.

now i shall rob one of my fathers gifts from the fridge.

that being said i love my friends, and ill see you all in hell... whether you care to admit it or not, if you hang out with people like me, thats where youll dwell for eternity...

If she doesnt respond ill be furious. cause im serious. i wanna marry her. but without further a-do, here is the e-mail:
____________________________________________________    

   Tour america... thats something you most likely have no control over, but even if you must kill someone... do it. Do they speak english in Holland? I know, I'm a stupid american. I'm gonna email the guitarist and ask him for an amp... I'm sure an established band has an extra amp laying around that they dont use (hint* hint* I play guitar). You should marry me... It would be a wise life decision, you can be the bread winner and i can lay around the house and eat cheetos and watch television, that'd be tottally awesome. Also, when im sick you can sing songs to me and make me feel better. And when you're sick or sad I can play Iron Maiden songs for you on my guitar of healing powers. Oh and we can make fondou (spelling?) holland style... i dunno if they do that in Holland but in my mind when i think of Holland i think of attractive people making fondou. Oh yeah, im 20 years old and kinda nerdy, so if you're looking for a big dude to protect you and stuff, you may have a problem, but if you dont want a big muscle dude then we are set... we'll start fights with Arnold Schwartznegger by telling him hes a terrible politician and runaway from him together. so yeah, marry me and give me free things... like shirts and albums... Oh, and your love, that'd be good for a marraige too, i'll give you mine. This isnt meant to be stalkerish, I'm just looking for a way to not have to work and have an awesome girlfriend and/or wife (I'd tell you how attractive i think you are, but i dont wanna flirt until we're making fondou).

Love,
Sean Gallagher

P.S. Sorry about the typing errors and horrible mis-use of the english language... i fuck things like that up alot... probably because I'm american...

also i got a very very awesome item which can only be found out by all of you by reading the entry and clicking the link! its on its way from... well if i told you that id give it away without u clicking on it.

I also saw the movie ""Big Fish"" very good by itself but i kept getting choked up during it for the wrong reasons. those actors are really good. and i hate to keep harping on it cause its a lost cause... but thats not the point... the looks the old dude (forget his name, sorry, thats wrong of me!) recieves from his wife and the son recieves from his i thought were intrigueing cause i kept saying ""damn, that french lady <the sons wife> looks familiar the way she gives him those lovers gazes... where have i seen her?"" then i realized i dont recognize her i recognize the looks from maria, and its not that im out to get her back, the whole thing comes full circle to it sucking knowing ill never achieve another G-to-the-F... and thats the whole point.

so virginia was fun, i also saw the third harry potter, so ryan, you can tell ben to take his precious and shove it you-know-where! it was a nice mini vacation. i listened to nightwish-century child for a vast majority of the trip back. and wishmaster and once on the way there. i just thought about lost love, find ing it again, why ashley isnt answering her phone and is she okay, happiness for bob and danielle, what natsha and derek are up to and how is steph rollin along with the sinister vinister. i thought about death and how i want ashley to get my journal i kept for a short while when i lived with pop pop, danielle i want to have the white box i keep everything of personal value achieved from ne girl, whether romantic or friend. how id want ryan to get the amp and pedals and ed get my main guitar. and steph get the telecaster, and the bass to my mom or dad or something since its the originale. how id want gene to get my computer, and how id want my cds to be split up between my friends (the girls getting first pick of course, its only custumary) in whatever way they want based on if the both want the same cd i want the decision based on rock paper scissors for the original copy of it (mainly cause itd be my last joke on ryan... he thinks hes the shit at rock paper scissors... and ill be watching his face when he loses the all the original nightwish albums to danielle and he has to settle for copys! hahaha! wallow in slightly lesser quality audio!). i would also wanna be holding my guitar at the viewing and at the funeral but of course not be buried with it, itd be a horrid thing to bury a completely awesome instrument. i take pride in my ability to turn 200-300 dollar guitars into hgih quality instruments with perfect string hieght and hotrod pickups! and it shall be used. oh and out of spite the only thing i want justin to have is a guitar pick and the stringwinder/cutter, and only copys of cds (not the orginal ones). just cause itd be funny to me in a sick way. but enough with that nonsense;

i also thought about the relationship between love and lust and the relationship of heart and mind. i also thought about how short life is and ways i can change my own. i thought about how important is for everyone to know that one of the few rights we should all excercise is to think what you want, know what you want, and say what you want and how noone can take it from you (yes i thought that when listening to iron maiden-journeyman). i thought about how the one scene in 'shawshank redemption' tought me that one ccan take everything way from you but they can never take the music away from your mind. i thought about the infamous fransesca lia block twist where weetzie realizes that someone always has to recognize the bad for the sake of a lack of ignorance and thats witch babys purpose and how for some reason i relate witch baby to ashley alot. needless tosay i thought about alot on the way to and from VA, i love those drives and its what i look forward to the most, and its even better when its alone. oh and most importantly i thought about how my darkness isnt really a thing of evil but a thing of... well its witch baby-esque. i thought about my darknesses alot and i related my prescence (when im in that mode of thought) to a shrouded ghost that swirls around me endlessly often grazing slightly against my cheek sending shivers through me. thats what it feels like so thats how i explain it.

it sucks cause a main purpose of going to va was to watch iron maiden-rock in rio in surround sound... but alas i forgot it.

if i think of nething else that i thought of that was kinda cool i post it again about it.

I cannot be warped into anothers mode of thought

I notice everything others do not

I see through your eyes and i know who you are, even if you do not

I see your future, whether it be dismal or glorious, but i will never tell you what it is

People like me do not become kings, leaders, tyrants or figure heads, but people like me DO create those in power

I am like no other, in mind or in soul

I do not believe in the heart, only in the mind and soul

I see beauty where others do not

I am nothing more then a boy in body and never will be ne more then that, but my thoughts and my emotions are ethereal and can never be reached

As soon as you think my mind in void of all though, that is when i am truly contemplating

I am a soldier of retribution

I see lacerations in clouds and i see demons walking the earth, but ill never tell you who they are

I can tell you someones character by their walk, how they speak, how they move and i can tell oyu who they are deep inside.

I yearn for transcendence but i know i will never find it... for if i did, i would never be able to feel what needs to be felt... and i am one of the few people left on the face of the earth with the courage to feel those emotions and see those visions.

I know for a fact that someday i will meet my dream girl and she will be beautiful... in scent, sight, sound, touch, and taste... but out of nothing more then cowardice i will let her slip through my fingers like granules of sand, and i will know when that moment has passed. i will weep and i will deny that ever met her, but in my spirit i will know the time has passed, and my chance gone forever.

I know there is not thin line between love and hate, nor is there a blurred one... there is a space of nothingness between love and hate, and that nothingness is a feeling all in itself... and i have felt it many times, for many reasons.

The only reason I am alive is out of selflessness. many think im selfish and hateful... an asshole even... but its those people ive influenced the most. everyone ive influenced has the oppritunity to be a great person. if i picture a round table with eveyrone ive every known sitting around it, i see myself making an offering to the rest of the table... it is not a wrapped up box with a ribbon or a bow, and it is not a dish... but it is a feeling... a new emotion that is the opposite of nothingness. what i also see happening at this table is everyone accepting and applying the gift to them selves... everyone but me.

There is no day, and there is no night, there is no AM and there is no PM, there is not early, and no late, no morning, afternoon, or evening. there are no digits, no clocks, and no watches... there is only time untouched.

I know what i want and i say what i want and more often then not nobody cares.

most of all: I attract people of evil origin and enemies... and i dont think i will ever know why. but i will always cry about it.

This entry is not about an ego... or a need to declare my place... nor was it about making myself out to be better then everyone else... its just an excercise for me to type out some of the things i feel at times... and see what they look like put somewhere else then my head. and ill be making more these... just to see hwat some of it looks like, and to determine if its true..."

speaking of rock, i rocked with ed on sunday and it went pretty well. i dont think he enjoyed all the artificiasl harmonics tho. but if i read up on scales and such and construct everything alot less chaoticly i think there is a future for acoustic lullabyes with tottally sweet metal underscores. its like ur sitting there like ""wow that homeboys supersweet acoustic stylistic is soothing my tortured soul!"" then all of the sudden...""OMG! artificail harmocics and tottally sweet double stops are coming to lacerate my flesh! what do i do now? its like imn relaxing with acoustic style and being destroyed by sweet metal riffs! this is GREAT!""

christ, im an idiot.. i should die.

"event","I LOVE FANTASY METAL!

see my logic is that my life is sub par so i make up for it with music. and want songs like ""bruce dickinson-tyrrany of souls"" allows me to do is imagine im one of the four horse men crushing people under my horses hooves (is that fucked up?), or in his song ""kill devil hill"" i can imagine i spend day after day slaying demons. lemme prove my point, awesome Bruce Bruce verses bitch ass guy from brandnew...choose one:

""a tyrrany of souls
that love has lost
a tyrranny of souls
a pentecost
speak in tongues of fire
its raining our disires
watching as we die""

OR

""every body wake up wake up wake up
its time to get down
and when i pass the bottle back to pete
on the overpass tonight ill bet we laugh
im gonna stay 18 forever so it can stay like this forever""

...EXACTLY FOLKS! EXACTLY!

i was kinda a dick to justin tonight but i dont feel bad like i normally would, when he realizes hes a fag with no identity to call his own, and that hes pretty much a frat boy and a big pussy except when his friends tell him he sucks. i rule to see the day he sticks up for himself amidst a stranger. 

i shoulda left his ass in the gutter long ago when jon started to think he was a meddling, prickish, fuck. but i wanna wait to see what happens, i mean if ryan keeps hanging out with him there has to be osmething worth my time. but then again ryan could be dealing with him cause he feels bad, which is highly possible. time will tell.

well, sleeping is as close as ill get to riding dragons in leather, spikes and iron, wielding my mighty sword, and vanquishing enemies of metal."

he has the new remove soul card which says ""counter target creature spell"" as opposed to my version that says ""counter target summon spell""...

now i cast a dust to dust which ""buries two artifacts"" on his horned helm and his yotian soldier... but casts a remove soul to counter burieing the yotian soldier saying that since i selected a creature with the dust to dust that it prvents him from being destroyed... uh... WRONG! since every newer creature card says ""creature-beast"" or ""creature-insect"" or ""legendary creature-beast"" in the spell type section, the remove soul card was revised. but the dust to dust is a sorcery card... im sorry, i know its a game but i get very riled when people do dumbshit.

thats the same with justin using ""counter target creatures abilities"" card, with him trying to use it to switch around words in the cards ability as to COUNTERING it. all gene is doing is switching shit around. its a remove soul. it ocunters a summoning spell. like the old one does.

"event","We held hands on the last night on earth. 
Our mouths filled with dust, 
we kissed in the fields and under trees, 
screaming like dogs, 
bleeding dark into the leaves. 
It was empty on the edge of town 
but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. 
So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea 
and the shattered seasons lay, 
and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. 
In our cancer of passion you said, 
""Death is a midnight runner."" 
The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. 
We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars 
that wore like an antique wedding dress. 
The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn 
as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. 
The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime. 
I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked 
if you would accompany me in a quick fall, 
but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't good for two. 

I rode alone. 

You said, ""The cinders are falling like snow."" 
There is poetry in despair, 
and we sang with unrivaled beauty, 
bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence. 
Of blue and grey. 
Strange, we ran down desperate streets 
and carved our names in the flesh of the city. 
The sun has stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon 
and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. 
Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, 
and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation 
scratched into the earth like a message."

"event","woo havent updated in forever. this thing is gaycore.

i have come up with a list of people god must hate. ill give u a few samples:

doctors- this choice may or may not be obvious. apparantly lots of people become doctors to help others, and alot of doctors are 'devout' catholics. the bitter comedy i see in all this is that APPARANTLY God called all doctors to help people by charging in excess of 100 dollars for basic check ups, and charge astronomical prices for surgeries that shatter people financially. isnt it so sweet that by helping people by pinning an ankle back in place, you cause crippling debt (if not homelessness, which is an extreme case) due to having to pay the bill and to make it worse the feller who broke his ankle cant work nemore to make the money to pay your greedy ass. therefore doctors are no better then partakers in the spanish inquisition. but theyre neccecary. so i deal.

people who give up meat on fridays for lent- this one i figured out earlier this month. now tell me why ur going to so strongly obey a human practice to appease a god who u supposedly 'adore' when ur such a fucking hipocryt, and everyone does it. its particularly funny that people who give up meat ussually have some other thing they should care about much MUCH MUCH more then a fucking porkchop... like alcolism, or duechebag-itus.

people who vote for bush- this mystifies me.... the presedent doesnt make the law of abortion, your only seeing which way he sways. but either way hell sway towards money and wont veto an pro-abortion law in the first place. so in voting bush all u do is vote for war, more death added onto what abortion is already doing, and greed. but really u vote for that neway.

that said, i bid u adue and hope u all find god... but keep in mind if u do ur still as much a prick as u were before (provided u were one in the first place). i dont know about u guys, but before i decide to let myself be bible-thumped i plan on choosing the right path to god."

speaking of which me and ryan tryed to make a song today. didnt go bad. but note for the future... when writing songs with others, have riffs pre-in-mind so things get down better."

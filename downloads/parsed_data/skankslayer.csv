Hello, journal.  It's been a really long time.  You're kind of gay and I don't like you but I'm bored.  The swimming pool was clean enough for me today so I decided to give it a whirl.  My big toe has been hurting me for a while and it's red.  My dog stepped on my foot and yellow stuff squirted out of the toe.  That was really nasty.  Then my 10 year old niece shoved me into the water with all my clothes on.  She's such a bitch."

I drank a lot of soda today and I eventually got this acidy taste in my throat.  I went to drink some milk to try and cancel out the damage and it seemed to work.  Then I burped and it smelled like gasoline.  

Either I'm going to explode or I've found a revolutionary formula that will solve our nation's fuel problems.

I'll tell you about how Wednesday went at school.

Last time I checked, my grade in Chemistry class is 26%.  This is due to falling asleep as soon as I sit down at my desk and waking up only to go to my next class.  My mother was kind of upset and said I had to pull up my grade in there.  I had missed school on Monday and I didn't go to Chemistry on Tuesday so I had take a make-up test on Wednesday.  Of course I knew nothing about Chemistry so I was in a dilemma.  The rest of the class was moving on to cover new things so the teacher asked if I wanted to go to the library to take my test where I could concentrate.  I said yes and immediately went to the biology class down the hall where most people were familiar with Chemistry.  Thanks to their help, I completed the test.  I then left the ""library"" and came back to Chemistry where I turned in my test, made fun of the foreign exchange student and tried to fall asleep."

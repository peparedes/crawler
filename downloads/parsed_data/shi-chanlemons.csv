Of course, he endured everything for the sake of the family's future and dedicated his existence to serving the tenth and everything else related to the name Vongola (Lambo hasn't gone missing yet).<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>   <p class=""p1"">The only thing he developed that wasn't really approved of in general was his smoking habit. Otherwise, if he were to paint a picture of how content with life he was, his painting would have a lush green garden, gallavanting unicorns and fluffy white bunnies, frolicking puppies, flora blooming everywhere, singing canaries and robins, blue skies, a bright rainbow and sparkling stardust all around.</p>  <p class=""p1"">That very picture that he managed to keep rock solid for the past several years was now as good as a toddler's attempt with art (using mud as a medium). His life's painting now consisted of dead and decaying mythical animals, wilting weeds, mud and continous monsoon season.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">It all started roughly about a month ago when he was over at Tsuna's house one summer evening, indulging on mama's snacks and generally having a good time with Tsuna (and Yamamoto, but he refused to acknowledge that) with their very first boy's-only-night. Mama and Bianchi had taken the kid along with the two girls (Kyoko and Haru) on an all-woman's-trip in the neighboring city (Lambo and Ipin <i>insisted </i>they come along) leaving the house all alone to Tsuna's care. Reborn made sure that Tsuna wasn't alone and that was why Gokudera (and Yamamoto) ended up under Tsuna's roof in the first place.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Reborn - surprisingly yet not much so - vanished for the weekend.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera remembered it clearly like it was only yesterday. They were having some of Mama's pudding while Tsuna fiddled with the remote control of their satellite-receiver. There was once a time when Gokudera wondered why Tsuna's family didn't have cable-TV and it never really got him thinking and mentally-raving-mad up until that evening and Yamamoto was the catalyst of it all.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">The rambling oaf suggested that they change the satellite dish's positioning via the remote of the digital receiver in order to access some movie-channel that had the latest action and adventure movies. Apparently, one of the fifty positioning on the digital receiver's list contained that 'really good channel with all the latest movies'. He also remembered Yamamoto saying something along the lines of:</p>  <p class=""p1""><i>&quot;Besides, it's for free? We don't really have to waste much cash on rental fees.&quot;</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">Needless to say, Gokudera had shamelessly agreed (silently) on the logic and even assisted Tsuna in finding the options in the main menu. It took about half an hour to figure out how to work the options and alot of arguing and swearing at Yamamoto from Gokudera's side but finally, Tsuna figured out how to work the receiver options and was going through the channels one by one.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera never thought that channel surfing was actually a good way to kill time (each positioning ranged from fifty to four hundred channels). It was actually quite amusing to see foreign channels and try to figure out what the people were saying (he remembered getting in to an argument with Yamamoto - actually, Yamamoto was only laughing - about some cooking show's ingredient). So while they bickered (and Yamamoto continued laughing), Tsuna chose to completely ignore them and continue channel surfing.</p>  <p class=""p1"">He happen to be in the middle of telling Yamamoto how much of a dumb idiot he was when he heard Tsuna scream. He turned just in time to find Tsuna toss the remote skywards with enough power to make Ryohei absolutely ecstatic before the brunette scurried backwards against the couch, grabbed a throw pillow and burried his face in to it. Of course, Gokudera panicked and momentarily forgot that the remote was yet to land back on the ground. Yamamoto gave out a loud and pained howl when the receiver remote landed on his head. The pull of gravity was so strong and Yamamoto's head so hard that the remote's battery lid popped off, along with both the AAA-batteries within. One of those batteries managed to somehow hit Gokudera just above his brow bone, causing him to howl and curse like sailor.</p>  <p class=""p1""><i>&quot;Damn you, Yamamoto! You baseball-oaf! What the hell was that for?</i>&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1""><i>&quot;It wasn't me! It was the remote!&quot;</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>It's your head's fault!&quot;</i></p>  <p class=""p1""><i>&quot;Tsuna lost control! It bounced off the ceiling!&quot;</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>Stop blaming the tenth for your blunders!&quot;</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera relentlessly insisted that it was Yamamoto's fault and that perhaps his head had some spring-like-attribute that others didn't have. He was so busy getting angry at Yamamoto (of course it wasn't Tsuna's fault! The boss can never be at fault!) that he completely forgot what caused Tsuna to scream, meep and scurry away like a wounded animal. He realized - after thinking back and making sense of things - that somewhere during the remote's trip to the ceiling and it's impact against the said ceiling, the volume control changed and the television was blaring whatever program that was currently on.</p>  <p class=""p1"">He was about to raise his fist and give Yamamoto's spring-head a good beating for blaming the tenth when a very loud <i>moan</i> filled the room. Tsuna squeaked again, cowering even further against the couch and trying to mesh together with the floor, face and ears as red as an apple.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>Make it stop!</i>&quot; Tsuna begged, yelling in to the couch's throw pillow.</p>  <p class=""p1"">It was only <i>then</i> did Gokudera (and Yamamoto) glanced at the television to find three naked men, all in great physical condition, with handsome faces and family jewels to be proud of. Gokudera felt his throat, mouth and eyes go dry as he watched the smaller of the three men lay back and spread his legs, while another man pushed right in to him. Apparently the loud groan came from the middle man because the third man was busy finger-fucking the middle man pushing in to the smaller whimpering and begging man. There were just so much 'man' about the whole act that Gokudera could feel his jaw hit the floor as he helplessly and powerlessly continued watching three very manly-men screw each other completely and helplessly entranced.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>H-Hey, it's gay porn.&quot;</i> Yamamoto said and when Gokudera glanced at him (because all three of them was suddenly as silent as a graveyard), the baseball-athlete was as red as Tsuna.</p>  <p class=""p1"">The three naked men contined doing each other until they were moving in synch and in a daisy-chain. Gokudera couldn't help but start to feel a little too warm and a little too uncomfortable with two other male friends being too close too him. Somewhere in the middle of all the groaning, flesh slapping and dirty talking, Tsuna resorted to banging his head repeatedly against the throw pillow while Yamamoto decided to form some sorth of mental thesis on how floors make good entertainment. Gokudera wasn't even aware of how much detail his brain was swallowing as he remained helplessly glued to the animalistic act on the television up until the three climaxed and Tsuna really, <i>really</i> started yelling.</p>  <p class=""p1""><i>&quot;Turn it off! I said turn it off! It's so loud! The neighbors! The neighbors! Augh my ears! My ears are bleeding! Turn it OFF!&quot;</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">Never the one to disobey a direct order, Gokudera scampered for the remote and ended up hitting his head against Yamamoto who also decided that the remote was the solution to all of their problems. This resulted in another round of swearing and Gokudera reminding Yamamoto (again) how much of a foolish maggot he was. Tsuna started hitting both of them - because he was so flustered, the poor guy - with the throw pillow, embarassed and turning an interesting shade of purple. Tsuna had his eyes closed and somewhere after hitting them each roughly about eight times, he started feeling the floor for the remote, still refusing to open his eyes.</p>  <p class=""p1"">By the time the three of them started poking around for the remote (which they later found to be on the other side of the room where it skidded across the floor after Yamamoto accidentally kicked it), the three men on television had started wokring each other up again and this time, the room was filled with loud long sucking noises coupled by moans and whimpers of, 'oh yeah', 'oh suck it good baby' and 'yeah, I'm gonna fill you up with cock'.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">There was so much commotion in the tiny orderly living room because even after they managed to find the remote, the batteries were missing. So the three of them turned the entire living room upside down to find the small alkaline-power-supply and by then, one of the three men was screaming and begging. Gokudera remembered the lines 'oh yeah, harder! Yeah fill me with cock! Ahhh!' because those were the only words he could hear for the next several days.</p>    <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>Oh my god! It's in him! It's in the guy! Look! Look! Yamamoto, how is that possible?!&quot; </i>Tsuna was raving, torn between trying to be a logical individual and being a man. He was gripping Gokudera's arm so hard and shaking him back and forth while raving.<br /><br />Yamamoto's eyes were so wide that Gokudera could have sworn - while trying not to whimper because Tsuna was quite strong - they were dinner plates.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Somewhere between the second climax and three getting worked up again for heaven's knows what round, right about when Gokudera's pants was starting to feel uncomfortable, he gave up in trying to locate the batteries and simply jerked the television wire out of the electric socket. The screen blacked out and the whole room was filled with blessed silence and three of them panting hard.</p>  <p class=""p1"">When it registered in Gokudera's head that all three of them were panting due to shortness of breath (what with the way they were running around the living room like headless chickens and turning every piece of furniture upside down), his mind took a trip to the gutter and <i>stayed</i> there. He couldn't sleep all night and their sleeping positions didn't help things either. With Tsuna on the bed while he and Yamamoto took the floor, it was very hard for him to not imagine being the middle man in the porn-show. With Yamamoto on his right and Tsuna on his left, his mind was conjuring up what it'd feel like to have man-sex with two of his classmates and family members.</p>  <p class=""p1"">He felt humiliated.</p>  <p class=""p1"">At first he thought that the hard ons he had to wrestle with every morning (along with the high-definition wet dreams) were just a bump on the road and within a day or two, the habit would die completely (or it would just remain to that level). A week later, Gokudera wasn't just wrestling with wet dreams and hard-ons, he had to tackle his newly developed skill of simply <i>spacing out</i> in the middle of <i>everything</i> which then came with a bonus two days later where every <i>male</i> that walked passed him was suddenly <i>naked</i>.</p>  <p class=""p1"">At the end of the first week, Gokudera was smoking exactly one pack of cigarettes and two cigars per day.</p>  <p class=""p1"">With his new x-ray vision, Gokudera didn't think anything else would come after that. It started becoming a real, <i>real</i> problem when he started bushing around <i>males</i> in general (especially in front of Yamamoto and Tsuna). There was once an occassion where he actually blushed in front of Reborn. He got kicked in the shin so hard that it knocked some sense in to his fried brain. Since then, any male the size of Reborn was out of the question (and he was very glad). He managed to come up with the facade that he was an angry individual and that the blush on his face was because he couldn't decide whether monkeys were smarter than the person he was talking to. He pretty much got away with blushing so much (even when all the girls cooed in the background) and for a moment, he thought that he could relax.</p>  <p class=""p1"">By then he was going through two packs of cigarettes and three cigars per day.</p>    <p class=""p1"">One day, sometime in the third week, Yamamoto came up to him to give him some sort of note from one of their teachers. The guy was innocently doing what he was told, parotting instructions on some project for some upcoming occassion that the school held anually when Gokudera started to hear things he shouldn't be hearing in the first place. The sentences that were screamed out in his dreams were coming out of Yamamoto's mouth; sentences like 'I'm going to fuck you, fill you with cock, you like that baby?' were flowing easilly out of the athlete's suddenly kissable lips that Gokudera mentally went on meltdown mode. He remembered yelling at the poor soul to 'shut the hell up, you pervert!' while grabbing the folders and shoving him away. He would never admit running <i>away</i> from Yamamoto of all people, but at the moment, he had no choice but to run away.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""><br /></span><br />After Yamamoto, he set a whole new record of smoking three packs of cigarettes while going on a tray of mini cigars per day.</p>  <p class=""p1"">He told himself that Yamamoto was a nobody and that he can just ignore the guy some more(since he ignored him in the first place) and move on with life. His mind argued that the guy was indeed rather physically attractive from being an athlete alone. To top that attribute with kendo training meant that Yamamoto posessed a body of a pin-up model. Gokudera swallowed his pride after his dreams became plagued with images of Yamamoto doing him in the doggy style and up against the wall.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Still, Gokudera believed that if he ignored it hard enough, it would go away. All he had to do was make sure he didn't speak to Yamamoto at all (<i>for absolutely </i><b><i>any</i></b><i> reason</i>) so that he wouldn't suffer through seeing him in x-ray vision while his mind conjured up illusions worse that Mukuro himself.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">When the fourth week looked around the corner, jacking off in the bathroom (be it at home, school or public parks) was starting to lose its charm. When at first all he needed to do was jack off once, now he needed to jack off at least three times before he could actually think straight. His torture, dilemma and complication really popped up when Tsuna became a part of his brain-fuck.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">It was one thing to start seeing him in stark naked mode but when his reality bent to a complete one-eighty degree while simply <i>talking</i> to Tsuna, Gokudera simply went <i>mad</i>. He didn't think he could stand it when his boss while innocently talking to him about something or the other would suddenly spew dirty talk begging to be taken, eyes wide and wanting, blush on his face and lips parted and moist.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera remembered screaming at the top of his lungs, his stomach churning worse than when Bianchi was around and bolting out of empt classroom like a cheetah on crack.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Which was why, after he holed himself in the apartment for several days, refusing to answer calls (both cellphone and landline), refusing to open the door (even when the milkman tried to reason with him that the milk would rot), Reborn decided to take things in to his own hands. It took alot of kick and will from Gokudera's side to keep the earphones in his ears that was attached to small player constantly repeating a pre-recorded mantra in to his head. Gokudera nearly crumpled when Reborn tossed the small player playing, 'I am the only man on earth and I don't see naked men' out the open window that he broke in through.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Gokudera Hayato. Is this the way to act like the Vongola's right-hand man?&quot; Reborn asked, standing on Gokudera's bed post while Gokudera remained cowering in the corner.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;I have retinal-allergies.&quot; Gokudera tried to reason pathetically. The days of living like a hermit in his room, not eating properly and generally not inhaling any sort of air from the outside world had turned him in to a hollow shell of his lively, fit and good looking self. He looked like he just walked out of a horror movie.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Yes, of course you do. Well, then I suppose Yamamoto will just have to take your place then. At least he doesn't let insignificant 'allergies' get in the way of his duties.&quot; Reborn shrugged.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera popped out the first excuse he could think of (and when he thought about it, he wished someone would hit him on the head with a sledgehammer). &quot;He's a sushi-man.&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Reborn didn't seem to be pertrubed by the bullshit Gokudera was spitting out and merely turned towards the window because Gokudera was simply being difficult. &quot;You're worrying Tsuna. My student can't even eat, sleep or study from constantly wondering what's gotten in to you and if he's done something wrong. Even Yamamoto came to me personally when you refused to open the door for him a few days ago.&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera felt his chest constrict, like he just broke all of his ribs and his lungs collapsed. He didn't give a flying shit what Yamamoto thought of him, but to think that Tsuna was worrying so much over him that it hindered his everyday life, Gokudera felt worse than phlegm spat out on the side walk. He knew how Tsuna functioned and the young man was probably too worried and too scared to 'piss him off even more' that he didn't even dare knock on his door. Tsuna was a good man, worthy of being the tenth and definitely one to feel what others were feeling. To think that his previous antics that was mostly due to his lack of control would cause Tsuna pain, Gokudera felt his eyes water. Tsuna wasn't the type to order people around unless he had to and Gokudera figured that Tsuna was putting enough faith and trust in to his right-hand man to take care of whatever personal problem he had. Still, the very idea of Tsuna trying very hard to put up a face of happiness for the rest of the family while deep inside he was wounded by Gokudera's actions was more than enough to sober him up.</p>  <p class=""p1"">With tears of shame and embarassment in his eyes that would have made Lambo proud, Gokudera dropped his head on the ground before Reborn - the only man who he believed could solve his entire problem and hopefully de-fry his already black-crisp brain - and told him <i>everything</i>. &quot;Reborn-san! Please, help me! I am so ashamed that I can't control these feelings and that is hindering my role as the Tenth's right hand man. Please advice me, Reborn-san!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Reborn was silent for a long while before he a smirk crawled its way to the Arcobaleno's lips. Gokudera felt his spine tingle. &quot;Did it ever occur to you to simply <i>tell</i> Tsuna about your problem?&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera <i>sputtered</i>. &quot;I - I can't tell him such shameful thoughts and desires! What would he think of me? He'd be disgusted, he'd fire me! I can't tell him that, Reborn-san!&quot; Gokudera came close to screaming and tearing his hair out till he turned bald, but Reborn looked down at him with an irritated and pitying look. Gokudera froze.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Tsk. What a shame that you don't trust your own boss to understand. And you call yourself the right-hand man. You don't even have enough faith in Tsuna that he'd understand what you're going through.&quot; Reborn shook his head and hopped away towards the open window.</p>  <p class=""p1"">By then, Gokudera put the term ghastly-complexion to a whole new level of shame. He was so white that he would have meshed in to his walls perfectly. &quot;I-It's not like that Reborn-san!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;I never would have thought.&quot; Reborn shook his head and disappeared out the window.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;No! No, wait! Reborn-san! <i>You can't leave me like this!</i>&quot; Gokudera <i>shrieked</i>.</p>  <p class=""p1"">The wind flowing from the open window was the only answer to his undignified call. It was only then did it dawn to Gokudera that he <i>really</i> needs to take matters in to his own hands before things really started exploding. Literally. A true right-hand man faces problems like any man would.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">He was going to have to tread carefully. He didn't want bad things happen because he didn't try to solve it. At least if he tried, later when things do go bad, he can simply tell himself that he tried and it was just not meant to be.</p>   <p class=""p1"">Gokudera picked up his house slipper and useless thwacked himself on the face with it.<br />&nbsp;</p>   <p class=""p1"">XXX<br />&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""p1"">When he vowed to take matters in to his own hands, he didn't think he'd choke everytime he attempted to speak to Tsuna. Yamamoto was but a mosquito in the background so he paid him no attention. That didn't mean he didn't choke around the athlete either.</p>  <p class=""p1"">His first plan was to slip in high-resolution male-threesome sexual pictures in to Tsuna's bag when he was sure no one else was going to be around should Tsuna 'accidentally' stumble over it. He admitted that it was a cowardly thing to do but he didn't want to be so vocal about it at first without having some sort of 'insight' on how Tsuna would react to the images (he knew the boy would freak out). His plan was to get Tsuna to see it while he was around and then (after all the freaking out) he would strike up a conversation regarding the matter. Hopefully, they would get in to a deep and meaningful understanding and Gokudera would finally be able to ask Tsuna to advice him on his problem.</p>  <p class=""p1"">He wasn't expecting his master plan to backfire<i> and</i> explode in the first ten minutes.</p> <p class=""p2"">They were coming down the school staircase to head home when some jackass decided that it was funny to trip 'no-good-Tsuna'. Gokudera watched with horror - both at the blasphemous act of tripping the Tenth and Tsuna falling face first towards the floor - as Tsuna's bag took a tumble down the last four steps and the picture - that large, glossy, expensive print - slipped out of bag and landed on the floor face-up, open for everyone to see. Gokudera felt his knees go weak and give out from under him as he slid against stair-railing and watched the train wreck in front of him.</p>   <p class=""p1"">Yamamoto was already walking up towards the bully who tripped Tsuna when one of the bully's minions spotted the picture and laughed out loud.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Ha! No-good-Tsuna, you like this kinda' stuff? Ugh! Man-pervert! Hey guys, take a look at what Tsuna-Tsuna keeps with him!&quot; One of the bully's cronies called out, waving the picture.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna was <i>lost</i>. &quot;Eh? What? <i>Man-pervert?</i>&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">The bully and two other cronies walked up to the stupid idiot waving the picture and all hell broke lose.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Oh my god! That's sick!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;No way! Hey, yo, maybe No-Good-Tsuna collects these stuff!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Turned out to be that he's Man-pervert-Tsuna after all!&quot; The bully laughed out loud and his cronies followed the example.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera was fuming and judging by the look on Yamamoto's face, the athlete wasn't very pleased with the situation either.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Come on you guys. Making false accusation on Tsuna isn't very nice.&quot; Yamamoto said, trying to quell the tension.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna was already on his feet and attempting to grab the picture. &quot;Let me see that! Just <i>what </i>is that? I didn't have a photo-print in my bag this morning!&quot; Tsuna was still a bit short for his height and the bully was having a jolly good time watching Tsuna jump around him to grab the picture. &quot;Give it!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Is that what you say to your boys, Man-Pervert-Tsuna?&quot; The bully crooned, grinning like a maniac.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Stop calling the Tenth a pervert!&quot; Gokudera couldn't stand it. There was no way he was going to let some retard walk all over his boss. That would happen over his dead body.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Of course, his name calling was ignored and the bullies continued to pass the picture to each other, clearly amused at how Tsuna was jumping around like an insane little bunny. Gokudera pulled out a couple of dynamite from his hidden pockets, ready to send the vermins to hell when Tsuna - he must be far too used to this - show him a look that clearly meant that the act was not going to be appreciated.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Gokudera-kun! No!&quot; Tsuna shook his head, warning look in his warm and embarrassed gaze.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>Ooooooh!</i> He's <i>commanding</i> his boyfriend!&quot; One of the cronies cooed.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna glared, temper rising. &quot;He is my <i>friend</i>! <i>Not</i> my <i>boyfriend</i>! Now give that back, whatever that is!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera barely heard the collective laughs from the bullies and barely saw Yamamoto shove them back, successfully taking the print and telling the goons to bugger off. He didn't really hear the name calling Yamamoto got in return for standing up for his friends and he didn't really see the expressions on their faces either.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp; </span>He was busy glaring at the linoleum floors, dynamites squeezed tight between his fists, his knuckles white. He was angry at the bullies for calling Tsuna names. He was angry at them for calling him - the righteous right-hand man - the Tenth's boyfriend, when clearly he was not. He was just a friend.</p>  <p class=""p1"">He was angry at himself for feeling bitter and crushed towards Tsuna's words.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Here you go, Tsuna.&quot; Yamamoto said, handing him the print, face a bit red and looking away.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1""><i>&quot;What the hell is this?&quot;</i> Tsuna screeched, dropping the print like a hot potato. His face turned scorching red as he palmed his forehead several times. &quot;Oh god. Oh god, no, no, no, no! As if No-Good-Tsuna wasn't bad enough!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera swallowed and picked up the fallen print. &quot;Do you want to keep this, Tenth?&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>No! Of course not!</i>&quot; Tsuna shook his head, flailing his arms. &quot;I don't like - I mean - Kyoko-chan, and I - <i>augh!</i> I will <i>never</i> live this down!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera felt flames of shame lick at his entire body. He didn't mean for Tsuna to get hurt or humiliated and everything was his fault. All plans of confessing or mentioning anything to Tsuna promptly flew out the window. He didn't know what to do. &quot;I'll kill them.&quot; He grumbled darkly. He remembered the faces and he can access private data whenever he felt like it. The bullies wouldn't even know what hit them.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna looked alarmed and Gokudera felt his insides churn even more. Thankfully, Yamamoto was there to break the sudden quiet that fell upon them. Gokudera didn't think he'd feel <i>minutely</i> relieved at the athlete's intervention (he also wasn't close to admitting it out loud too).</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Maa, things will die down. Don't worry about it, Tsuna.&quot; Yamamoto said, smiling just like always and patting Tsuna reassuringly on the shoulder.</p>  <p class=""p1"">With just a little bit of I'm-beating-you-down-envy, Gokudera watched as Tsuna sighed and smiled back up at Yamamoto. &quot;Thanks, Yamamoto.&quot;</p>   <p class=""p1"">Gokudera was pretty sure that he was going to keep his mouth tightly shut about the whole plan. He was also sure that not even Reborn would be able to convince him otherwise.<br />&nbsp;</p>   <p class=""p1"">XXX<br />&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera was practically scowling behind his curtain of silver hair as they walked back towards the Tenth's house. It was far from his way but it was his duty as the right-hand-man to make sure that Tsuna reached his abode safe and well. The walk was a rather embarrassing one, none of them really talking after what just took place in the school campus. Gokudera knew his face was as red as Tsuna's dying will flame and he was glad, that somehow, Tsuna himself was blushing the whole walk home. A quick glance at Yamamoto told him that the taller teen was unfazed by what just took place; Gokudera summed him up as an idiot who had no feelings.</p>  <p class=""p1"">The walk had to end sometime and they soon found themselves staring up at Tsuna's house. Gokudera kept following Tsuna even as they walked passed the house-gates. He was forced to come to a sharp halt when he felt a large hand grip him by the arm, pulling him back.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;We'll get going now, Tsuna. Do you need anything?&quot; Yamamoto asked, killing all protests that was ready to explode out of Gokudera's mouth by effectively squeezing his arm hard enough to bruise.</p> <p class=""p2"">Tsuna smiled, shaking his head. &quot;I'm good. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Really, you two, you didn't have to go through the trouble.&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>&quot;N-No trouble.&quot; Gokudera said, turning to glare at Yamamoto who still refused to let go of his arm. Gokudera was suddenly very tempted to shove one of his dynamites up the baseball-nut's ass just to watch him explode in to a spray of red. &quot;We'll see you tomorrow, Tenth.&quot;<br />  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Yeah.&quot; Tsuna said, giving them a short wave before disappearing through his house's front door.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera all but wrenched his arm out of Yamamoto's grip - well, he tried to. Yamamoto simply dragged him out of the gates and continued to do so till they were four houses away from Tsuna. &quot;What is with you! Let go of my arm, you twit! I said, let go! Are you deaf? Quit dragging me around! <i>Yamamoto</i>!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera nearly flew back from the inertia as Yamamoto suddenly let go of his arm. He lost his footing and ended up leaning against the cemented wall-fence behind him. &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;What the hells is the <i>matter</i> with <i>you</i>?&quot; Gokudera all but howled at the taller teen and nearly did a double take when he saw Yamamoto <i>frowning</i>. Yamamoto did <i>not</i> frown. &quot;Do <i>what</i>?&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Why did you put that print in his bag?&quot; Yamamoto asked, very calmly, very flatly; it drove Gokudera up the wall.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Because!&quot; Gokudera said, all reason flying out of his mind. He didn't think he could weasel his way of the conversation, not when Yamamoto was looking so seriously at him (and <i>frowning</i>).</p>  <p class=""p1"">Yamamoto sighed and shook his head, the frown disappearing and his carefree expression coming back. Gokudera started to feel a little bit uncomfortable, neck warming up. &quot;Why don't you just ask him? Tsuna is a cool guy, he'll understand.&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Look!&quot; Gokudera snapped. &quot;There is nothing wrong, that was an accident, leave me alone. Go away.&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Without another word he turned around and stomped towards the general direction of his home, hands in his pockets, scowling and the blush not leaving his cheeks. Yamamoto didn't follow him and he found a little comfort in that for when he reached home, he filled the tub with icy cold water and submerged himself in it completely.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Yamamoto wasn't helping things at all; not when he so readily suggested that it was doable, that he <i>didn't</i> mind.</p>   <p class=""p1"">Gokudera opened his mouth and screamed in frustration under the water, watching as the bubbles rose around him in the tub.<br />&nbsp;</p>   <p class=""p1"">XXX<br />&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""p1"">He knew he was exercising his patience to the point that it was starting to get unhealthy. After a week passed since Yamamoto cornered him in the street, Gokudera was starting to feel exhausted, the random sparks of arousal whenever he got close to the male homo sapiens was wearing down. It was a good thing for him in a way because he had officially turned to a full time insomniac (and with it, he couldn't eat, he couldn't focus and mostly functioned on routine). According to his calculations, he should be fine (that meaning, he wasn't going to jump Tsuna and Yamamoto at the same time any time soon).</p>  <p class=""p1"">What he didn't calculate was the fact that his fatigue and loss of focus was going to gloriously backfire on him.</p>  <p class=""p1"">It was a Tuesday when it happened. They were at the gym, doing P.E, their teacher making the boys run laps and he was starting to struggle after the tenth one. Perhaps it was the fact that he skipped breakfast (partially because Bianchi popped in with poison-toasts and partially because he had no appetite, what with the way he was consuming cigarettes lately) or perhaps it was from the lack of sleep, Gokudera wasn't entirely sure. Somewhere between the eleventh and sixteenth lap, Gokudera felt his knees go weak and suddenly, he was skidding across the gym floor, about three pairs of feet accidentally stomping on him and his lip split, nose also bleeding profusely from where it hit the floor.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Gokudera-kun!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Gokudera!</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Oi, you!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to step on you!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera felt himself hiss as he slowly struggled to get back to his feet, a hand coming to his nose in a futile attempt to stop the bleeding. It wasn't so bad because he might have just nicked something within; the blood flow was starting to slow down. He snarled at the concern his classmates was expression, scowled a 'I'm fine, damnit' at the teacher who was starting to berate him for being careless, and nearly cursed at the girls practically screaming at the other end of the gym of 'how dramatically beautiful' and 'cutely injured' he was.</p>  <p class=""p1"">It was downright ludicrous.</p>  <p class=""p1"">A strong hand pulled him up on his feet as his arm was slung around a slightly broader shoulder. He scowled (the action futile because of his bloody nose and lip area) when he noticed it was Yamamoto. He parted his mouth to give the nut a good verbal spanking when Tsuna's face loomed around him, a warm and smaller gentle hand on his shoulder.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Gokudera-kun, are you okay? We're going to take you the infirmary all right?&quot; Tsuna said, wide brown eyes full of concern. &quot;Sensei! We're taking Gokudera-kun to the infirmary! Please excuse us!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera could feel his heart sink at making the Tenth worry over his pathetic no-control self.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Tsuna, can you get Gokudera's towel?&quot; Yamamoto said, shifting Gokudera's arm on his shoulder.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Stop ordering the Tenth around!&quot; Gokudera sneered, glaring up at the slightly taller boy.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna returned with the said towel, pressing it against Gokudera's nose to stop the bleeding. &quot;It's okay, Gokudera-kun. Really. Now, hold on to that. Let's go Yamamoto.&quot; He said and quickly moved to open the door.</p>  <p class=""p1"">The walk back to the infirmary felt like a solid decade and silence wasn't helping things either. By the time they did reach the infirmary, Gokudera got the 'Why are kids so clumsy these days, geez' lecture from the nurse as she not-so-gently rubbed some bitter tasting ointment on his slightly cut lip and later on shoving an ice pack against his nose. He had half the mind to actually bitch right back because of her attitude but decided against it.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">He slumped on the bed, sighing as he pulled the ice pack down. His nose was feeling numb and it didn't help that Tsuna and Yamamoto were looking at him like he grew two heads.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Don't let him out of here till I get back. I'll be back in a few minutes.&quot; The nurse huffed, checking Gokudera's face once more before clicking her tongue and leaving the infirmary with the door slamming loudly.</p>  <p class=""p1"">The staring resumed.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera snapped.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Yamamoto didn't budge from his stare, still looking calm. Tsuna - he noted - got all flustered and started flailing his arms, shaking his head and lamely attempted to explain how they meant no harm.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Gokudera-kun, what's happening to you? You space out. You're angrier, your temper is worse, we're worried. <i>I'm</i> worried. Are things okay?&quot; Tsuna asked, fingers twisting the hem of his shirt, a habit, Gokudera noted, that Tsuna developed when the young man felt that he was intruding in to things he shouldn't be.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera felt himself blush and Tsuna's concern shot straight to his groin.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;I-It's nothing.&quot; Gokudera said, lying through his teeth. It was right about then when he saw Yamamoto's eyes darken and Tsuna's face fall.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Oh.&quot; Tsuna said, fingers gripping his shirt even more. &quot;Well, w-we're here if you ever need anything. Gokudera-kun ... is my friend after all.&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1""><i>And right hand man and I should even be thinking like this, but fuck! </i>Gokudera smiled weakly, fingers gripping the ice bag a little too tight than normal, fingers going numb from the cold.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Thank you, Tenth.&quot; He said, groin stirring some more. His desperation, his libido that needed to be quelled - Gokudera bit his tongue as he struggled to regain some semblance of self control.</p>  <p class=""p1"">And failed miserably.</p>  <p class=""p1"">His fingers clenched on the ice pack before he dropped it recklessly on the ground, getting on his feet and walking up to Tsuna, flicking a look at Yamamoto that clearly indicated what he was planning to do. It was stupid, ridiculous and downright risky - <i>but damnit, I'm mafioso, risk comes in to the game all the goddamn time!</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;G-Gokudera-kun? You shouldn't really get out of bed. Really. You still have to ice your nose!&quot; Tsuna said, fussing and wondering why his friend's demeanor changed so suddenly.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;He's fine, Tsuna.&quot; Yamamoto said, moving from his position against the wall to pick up the discarded ice pack and placing it on the table.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;But -&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Tenth.&quot; Gokudera said, now a good feet away from Tsuna, hands on the smaller and narrower shoulders. &quot;Tenth - I -&quot; He felt his heart skip several beats, his fingers dig in to the soft shoulders as he licked his lips. &quot;I <i>must</i> do this.&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;D-Do what?&quot; Tsuna asked, eyes wide as Gokudera sank down on his knees before Tsuna. &quot;Oh - <i>oh</i>! Gokudera-ku- <i>ah</i>!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera yanked down Tsuna's P.E pants, letting it pool around the the sneaker-clad feet before firmly taking hold of the limp cock before him and wrapping his lips around the head. Gokudera didn't wait for permission anymore, knowing full well he was going to regret the crap out of it later, but with Tsuna in his mouth then and there, he <i>really</i> couldn't bring himself to give a fuck.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">The sounds Tsuna was starting to make went straight to his groin. He whimpered around the the hardening arousal in his mouth, sucking as hard as he could and making Tsuna stutter as the Vongola heir attempted (and failed gloriously) to voice a protest that was starting to slowly morph to deliciously arousing mewling sounds.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Tenth,&quot; He Gokudera gasped after pulling his mouth off the throbbing arousal with a rather loud and obscene popping noise. &quot;I need this. I'm sorry to have worried you, but I really, really <i>need</i> this.&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna slid down the wall due to his weakened knees, legs apart, cheeks flushed and lips parted open as hots breaths was exhaled. Gokudera could put two and two together; Tsuna wasn't comprehending things right, not when Gokudera had his mouth on him again and was sucking with even more renewed vigor. The half-italian could feel his own throbbing arousal being confined by his extra tight underwear (he had to start wearing a size to tight to keep his libido under control) and a part of his brain was screaming, <i>where the fucking hell is that baseball-nut?</i></p>  <p class=""p1"">He flicked a gaze to his left, mouth busy and hands lightly massaging Tsuna's all too warm balls, and caught site of Yamamoto staring at Tsuna then at his full mouth then back Tsuna. Gokudera felt a warm pleasure spread through out his chest when he noted with a smirk at how Yamamoto was standing as rigid as a surf board, unmoving, flushed and breath coming out a little too fast than normal. It was so good to see the idiot in an expression other than his calm-happy-go-lucky face.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;G-Gokudera, a-are you -&quot; Yamamoto stuttered, swallowing thickly.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Ahhh G-Gokudera-k-kun, s-so good ...&quot; Tsuna moaned, throwing his head back against the wall when Gokudera ran his teeth against the head of Tsuna's throbbing and already leaking arousal.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;You!&quot; Gokudera gasped, hands making wild strokes against Tsuna's rigid and slender cock while he scolded the taller boy. &quot;Get that tube of ointment and <i>get</i> busy!&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> <br /></span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera felt a twisted sort of satisfaction when heard Yamamoto scamper for the nurse's medicine cupboard, taking the first tube of ointment while Gokudera busied himself with nibbling on Tsuna's thighs.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;I-Is this f-from that - ahhh - night?&quot; Tsuna asked, hands fisting on Gokudera's hair. &quot;I-Is - damnit, more! - this t-the reason you're -&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Yes.&quot; Gokudera breathed out, sucking on the inner thigh, his other free hand moving to rub at Tsuna's navel area. &quot;Always. Ever since.&quot; He answered in between licks and nibbles.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;W-What - d-don't s-stop!&quot; Tsuna moaned, completely lost in the adrenalin and hormonal rush.</p> <p class=""p2"">Gokudera shivered when he felt a hot hand pressed against his shirt. He got horribly distracted when that hand slid under his shirt in an almost tantalizing slowness before calloused fingers touched the base of his spine. Gokudera cursed - and a foul one at that - because Tsuna was mewling with need at the loss of contact and Yamamoto was messing around by <i>hesitating</i>.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>   <p class=""p1"">&quot;G-Gokudera, a-are you sure -&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;For fuck's sake, Yamamoto!&quot; Gokudera growled, a few more curses accompanying his phrase that made Tsuna blush even more. &quot;Pull my pants down, lubricate the goddamn thing and <i>fuck</i> me already!&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Under normal circumstances, Tsuna would have flailed at the foul language. Under normal circumstances, Gokudera wouldn't have cursed like a sailor and of course, Yamamoto would have simply laughed. But they were no longer in a situation which could be categorized as normal; not when Tsuna was half lying against the wall, legs apart and pants by his ankles, not when Gokudera was bent over Tsuna, his back side slightly raised and his trembling hands firmly planted against Tsuna's inner thighs and most definitely not when Yamamoto was kneeling on shaky knees on the ground, right behind Gokudera and squeezing a good amount of muscle-relief-ointment on his fingers.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera would have shot him self with an AK47 if such a thing ever played in his head in the first place. It was ludicrous, insane, irrational and beautifully animalistic.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera's pants came off - or was practically jerked down with brute force - and as a result, he slipped on his kneeling position and ended up face first against Tsuna's belly. Tsuna had automatically wrapped his wiry arms around Gokudera's neck, hips arching off the ground and rubbing his erection against Gokudera's P.E t-shirt for some much needed friction just as Yamamoto pressed a curious and almost hesitant finger against Gokudera's entrance.</p>  <p class=""p1"">The intrusion was clumsy - they were all clumsy - and Gokudera whimpered against Tsuna's chest as the long slim and calloused finger slowly wriggled its way in to his body. He gritted his teeth, mind clouded with pure unbidden lust. It was purely out of instinct and his engraved desire to never hurt the Tenth that somehow made his motor nerves function again. A pale shaky hand reached down to prod at Tsuna's entrance. Balancing his weight on his knees and the forehead on Tsuna's stomach, he reached behind with his free hand and grabbed Yamamoto's knee, fingers digging in to the muscled flesh.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;H-Here ...&quot; Yamamoto breathed out heavily, voice a deeper baritone than normal as he pressed the tube against Gokudera's fingers.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera moaned and went about spreading a good amount against Tsuna's pliant and tight entrance, before slowly pushing his fingers in. Tsuna nearly screamed then but was somewhat smart (later on, Gokudera admired it even more) to quickly bite his lip down, gather a portion of his shirt and stuff it in to his mouth as a makeshift gag. Later, Gokudera would praise him for it (assuming he'd have the balls to even bring the subject up) but for now, he concentrated on stretching Tsuna, taking his time and biting down the urge to just shove all three of his fingers in to the tight, tight ring of muscle.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">His fingers faltered when he felt Yamamoto's second finger slide in and he nearly - nearly - passed out when the idiot started to scissor-stretch him. He had to quickly bite his own shirt to keep himself form screaming, further burying his face against Tsuna's stomach (whose breaths was so labored). As a result, he had unconsciously shoved two of his fingers against Tsuna and that made the smaller teen tremble and tightly shut eyes to water with tears.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;I'm sorry ... I'm sorry ... I'm so sorry ...&quot; Gokudera whimpered, all three fingers very still as he felt Tsuna's muscles close in on him like a vice. &quot;Gods, Tenth - Tsuna, I'm so sorry.&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Yamamoto was silent - always silent as he continued to stretch Gokudera to the point that it was almost painful. Gokudera knew the pain he was causing Tsuna because Yamamoto was doing the same to him. His apologies - he knew - were going unheard because Tsuna's wanton face said everything.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;G-guy,&quot; Yamamoto gasped, just as he pulled out all three of his fingers (Gokudera felt relief). &quot;W-We should h-hurry. T-The n-nurse ...&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Tenth.&quot; Gokudera gasped, shifting his fingers twice before pulling it out completely. &quot;I - I - We -&quot; He stuttered pitifully, feeling hot desire pool in to his groin at the flushed and nearly-begging site Tsuna was dispalying before him.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">The temptation to just kiss the teen before him nearly killed him but he held back. A kiss was too personal, too intimate and there was nothing intimate about what they were doing; he was <i>not</i> Tsuna's lover and he was smart enough to not think otherwise even in their current predicament. They were on an hormonal rage, just like how anyone would feel the urge to just jerk off when seeing something easy on the eyes; only their situation had escalated to the point that fucking was the only way out.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;G-Gokudera-k-kun, y-you g-gotta h-hurry. I-In m-me, <i>n-now</i>!&quot; Tsuna gritted out through his shirt-gag, eyes flashing at Gokudera with a warning.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;G-Go first, G-Gokudera.&quot; Yamamoto said, shakily reaching down and smothering Gokudera's cock with the ointment they used as lube.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera moaned, throwing his head back as hot hands ran up and down his throbbing and already dripping cock. He was was trembling even more than before. When he felt the hands leave, he moved to hoist both of Tsuna's legs over his shoulder, leaning his weight down on the teen below him, hands on either side of Tsuna's side as he touched the tip of his erection against the spasming ring of begging muscles.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;I - I - &quot;Gokudera was hesitating in the wrong time and Tsuna did <i>not</i> like it.</p>  <p class=""p1"">A thin hand grabbed Gokudera's hair from the base of his skull and Gokudera found himself face to face with his boss's smothering eyes, the look going straight to his chest and turning to molten lust that pooled over his belly. &quot;<i>N-Now</i>!&quot; Tsuna growled, and Gokudera complied.</p>   <p class=""p1"">He was going to reach with his free hand to guide himself in but a calloused one beat him to it. He hissed when he felt Yamamoto's hand firmly grip his erection and slowly pushed in through the tight entrance. He felt Yamamoto's desire pressed against his backside, the thing large and long and very slick. He was blinded with excitement for a moment that he didn't feel anything when Yamamoto guided his waist down in to Tsuna's body. He only sobered up when he felt Tsuna's body tighten around him and he was buried to the hilt and Tsuna had gone deathly silent.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p> <p class=""p1"">A glance up told Gokudera that Tsuna had his eyes closed, neck tilted back to it's fullest, eyes wide and mouth open in a silent scream of pleasure and pain.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;S-Slowly. H-Hold still.&quot; Yamamoto said, voice barely a whisper. &quot;R-Relax, G-Gokudera.&quot;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera was about to snark at the words but it never made it passed his throat as he felt himself being stretched to his fullest. He grounded his teeth, breath hissing out through said teeth before burying his face in to Tsuna's chest, biting at the fabric of the shirt to keep himself silent.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;F-Fuck!&quot; He cursed, knuckles turning white against the cold marble floor of the infirmary as Yamamoto stilled behind him, who was biting down a moan and the urge to just fuck Gokudera in a frenzy.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p> <p class=""p2"">They remained as still as statues, only their harsh and heavy breathing filling the room. It may have been a minute or ten, none of them were sure. It wasn't until Tsuna managed to moan wantonly again and mumbled <i>beggingly </i>for Gokudera to <i>move </i>did the silence break. It was like the curtain was raised from over their lust-drugged minds and the need to finish and hurry took over, bringing along with it a strange form of excitement at the idea that they might get caught.</p>  <p class=""p2"">Gokudera swallowed thickly and pushed himself up, leaning his palms against the wall, as Tsuna slid against the ground and lying against it completely. Gokudera shifted a bit, adjusted his balance while Yamamoto held his waist steady for more stability.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class=""p2"">&quot;H-How ...&quot; He asked, or the first time at a loss, because their positions weren't right and it was going to be difficult.</p>   <p class=""p1"">&quot;Loosen up ...&quot; Yamamoto breathed out, gripping his waist tight. &quot;Move in slowly.&quot;</p> <p class=""p2"">Gokudera looked down at Tsuna, affectionately brushed off a strand of the sweaty brown locks and made a short thrust. The play on Tsuna's facial expressions then was worth it. Tsuna cursed - he actually cursed - before begging.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>&quot;D-Don't s-stop!&quot; He moaned, head thrown back. &quot;A-Again!&quot;<br />  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera moved once, twice, thrice until he set a quick rhythm, Yamamoto's body behind him following his rocking motions. It was only after he managed to set a steady rhythm and Tsuna was panting underneath him, brown irises obscured by tightly clenched eyelids, did Yamamoto change his rhythm. He wasn't moving Gokudera anymore and instead, he moved against his rhythm. Gokudera was rattled out of his haze clouded mind when he felt Yamamoto thrust in to him just when he pulled out of Tsuna. The process repeated and soon they were all panting and spouting out nonsense as their bodies moved and the hormones took charge.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna came first, quick, hot and strong, teeth tearing through the fabric of his own shirt, groan coming out strangled and needy, a sound of freedom as his body tensed. Gokudera had to <i>stop</i> moving, not because he <i>wanted</i> to, simply because Tsuna's body went impossibly <i>tight</i> around him and he <i>couldn't</i> move. He gritted his teeth, throwing his head back as Yamamoto continued to move against him. He felt the foreign heat spread through his body just as Yamamoto dropped against his back and sank his teeth in to this shoulders.</p>  <p class=""p1"">It didn't take more than a few seconds and about three thrusts later from his side and he too reached the peak of orgasm, Tsuna's body tightening against him at the release and his own teeth tearing at Tsuna's shirt as well. He made a pitiful and lost like sound at the base of his throat as he went perfectly still.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">For a fleeting moment, neither Tsuna nor Yamamoto existed. He was the only person in the world, floating in an endless expanse of white and freedom, the accumulated stress due to his own stupidity and lack of control slowly melting away to blissful nothingness. He sighed deeply, the need in his body sated to the core.</p> <p class=""p2"">Everything was just peaceful ... until the loud tapping of stiletto heels and the irritating whiny voice of the infirmary nurse echoed down the halls.</p>They all stiffened.<br />  <p class=""p1"">&quot;Shit!&quot; Yamamoto growled.</p> <p class=""p1"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""p1"">XXX</p> <p class=""p1"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""p1"">To the current day (which was a good one week later), Gokudera will never, ever understand how they <i>managed</i> to detangle themselves from each other, get rid of the stains on the floor, discard the abused and empty tube of muscle-pain-reliever ointment and still look normal as if nothing happened all in <i>ten</i> seconds flat.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">He did know that he ended up with a dead toe nail from when he stubbed the said toe against the foot of the bed in his rush to sit on it (painfully because his backside was <i>raw</i>). He also ended up with a slightly bruised nose from when he roughly shoved the solid ice pack against it in a rushed and therefore rough manner. He briefly remembered Yamamoto moving to stand by the window and sliding it open to air out the room and Tsuna sitting obediently in one of the chairs, arms crossed against his chest to hid the saliva patches and the holes made by their teeth.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Gokudera bought him a new school shirt.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Mercifully, none of them broached against the subject nor did they even even ask. As a result, Gokudera was far more relieved because somehow, they all fell in to their familiar daily routine: school, classes, bicker, argue over lunch, walk the Tenth home, hang out a bit, disperse. No one brought it up, no one asked about it, no one bothered.</p>  <p class=""p1"">And for that Gokudera was grateful.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">There were times - rare times - when he would look at Tsuna or at Yamamoto, eyes burning with intensity and begging for a sentence or two regarding the matter. In those rare times, he would see in the eyes of his boss and family member that they knew, that they understood and that they felt what he felt and a need to simply let go. They were no longer children, not since their battles, not since suffering wounds that even adults don't go through sometimes and not since their losses and wounded pride.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">It wasn't like they didn't <i>wan</i>t to understand. They simply <i>had</i> to.</p>  <p class=""p1"">And in those rare times, Gokudera would <i>see</i> just what a capable and understanding leader Tsuna was, to know his subordinates, to give his subordinates a hand when things clouded their minds and most of all, to not burden his friends - not just subordinates anymore - with the weight of carrying something almost shameful. But it wasn't shameful, because first and foremost, Tsuna didn't categorize it as such.</p>  <p class=""p1"">Once, and only once, did Tsuna speak and since then, Gokudera didn't dwell on the matter and the sex slowly faded to a distant memory, a teenage blunder of hormones, nothing more. He knew better than to make personal - they all did and they were mature enough to not push the subject against the other.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">It was the mafia way if one would tilt their heads to one side and look at it closely.</p>  <p class=""p1"">&quot;We needed it.&quot; Tsuna said, calmly, collective, no longer the stuttering and hesitant no-good-Tsuna that the school labelled and knew him for. &quot;We're better now, we understand each other. We respect each other. And I can't ask for anything better than that.&quot;</p>  <p class=""p1"">Tsuna's will was Gokudera's will. If Tsuna says it was better, then it was better.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">He wasn't going to ask for anything more and as the Tenth's right hand man, he was going to stand firm by his boss's words, decision and claims. His personal feelings can rot in hell for all he cared.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>  <p class=""p1"">Because despite everything that happened, despite what he felt about the situation and how he wanted to do it again, with Tsuna, with Yamamoto - the Vongola Family and it's firm foundations came first. Always first. And he was not about to jeopardize their friendship, trust and family-relationship by bringing in his personal baggage. He knew the loses, he knew the price he was going to pay, and it wasn't worth his personal gain.</p> <p class=""p2"">It was the way of the mafia, the way of the family. It was the way of the hit-man. And Gokudera Hayato was a goddamn good one.</p>FIN</div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Kakashi dangled it in front of Iruka's face, his other hand reaching down to push the shirt up. Iruka tugged the shirt off and tossed it behind his head on the floor. He allowed Kakashi to stare all he wanted, noting how the mismatched eyes lingered on the jewelry he donned. Iruka eyed the simple metal framed bed and shifted so that he was lying with the footboard behind his head. He raised his arms, closing his eyes as Kakashi tied his wrists to the foot of the bed, the ropes long enough for Iruka to tug a bit but not enough for Iruka to touch any part of his own body.</p><p>A shuddering breath escaped Iruka's lips as his nervousness elevated when Kakashi started to tug his pants down. Kakashi leaned forward once Iruka heard his jeans drop to the ground, lips claiming Iruka's once more. Iruka closed his eyes, forcing himself to relax despite his visible nervousness.</p><p>&quot;Scared?&quot; Kakashi asked, lips brushing against his as he spoke.</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>Iruka swallowed thickly and kept his eyes clothes. &quot;I don't know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't be. Pain and pleasure can make you forget everything.&quot; Kakashi said, voice promising exactly what he just said.</p><p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Iruka asked, watching as Kakashi leaned back on his heels and pulled something out of his pocket, dangling three metallic rings over Iruka's nose. Iruka recognized it and his eyes widened, the sight of the sexual device heating up his belly. &quot;W-Wha -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn't think you'd show up. But I planned this just in case you did. Had to go get stuff just for you.&quot; Kakashi said. Iruka watched as Kakashi's eyes trailed down his belly and towards the waistband of his blue boxers. Iruka tried to keep himself from arching up when Kakashi started drawing light circles over his waistband.</p><p>Iruka's mind started to turn into an uncomprehending organ and he found himself whimpering without control. &quot;P-Please, no ...&quot;</p><p>Kakashi's smirk filled the room as he tugged the boxers down, cupping Iruka's twitching desire and slipping the device on. Iruka gritted his teeth and arched when Kakashi had to squeeze a bit too hard without the help of lube to get the device in its proper place, making Iruka bite his lower lip to stop the agonizing scream from escaping his mouth; Iruka never thought that a day would come when he will be wearing a triple-ring cock-ring. The cool metallic feel made Iruka buckle under Kakashi's towering shadow, a groan tearing itself involuntarily out of his throat.</p><p>&quot;You know, that thing has your name engraved on it. Customized.&quot; Kakashi said, kneeling down to kiss the slightly red testicles from his harsh squeeze earlier. The kiss only made Iruka grow harder. &quot;Ready for more?&quot;</p><p>&quot;N-No ... Ka-Ka-Kashi ...&quot; Iruka blabbered, turning his head to one side, completely forgetting that he was lying naked in front of a man he once thought was insane. Then again, with the way Kakashi was speaking, he could have been insane; Iruka was enjoying it. &quot;Y-You c-can't ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Funny how you keep saying no and no.&quot; Kakashi chuckled leaning over to nibble on the jewelry on Iruka's navel. &quot;Should I take my shirt off, Iruka?&quot;</p><p>Iruka turned his lust glazed eyes over at Kakashi, tugging as the ropes that bound him so that he can pull Kakashi down to kiss him and shut the yapping trap up. &quot;K-Kiss ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't think you're in any position to demand right now.&quot; Kakashi smirked and got off the bed. Iruka groaned loudly and whimpered like a deprived man when the heat of Kakashi's body disappeared. He felt something dropping on the bed but he couldn't see what it was. Kakashi leaned over him and kissed one of his collar bones, teasingly leaving a short lick-trail and making Iruka's arousal harden even more. &quot;Take my shirt off?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kashi...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're not answering the question.&quot;</p><p>Iruka forced himself to peel his eyes open and found Kakashi looming over him, looking devilishly handsome in the dim light. Iruka briefly wondered if it was possible to fall in love with a person with a cocky smirk on their face. &quot;Y-Yes! Please!&quot;</p><p>Iruka also wondered how he was reduced to begging in such a short time.</p><p>Kakashi did take his shirt off, tossing it somewhere on the floor before he uncapped a tube of lubricant. &quot;I am going to play with your body, 'Ruka. And I'm going to make you feel good. I haven't had dessert yet.&quot;</p><p>Iruka briefly caught sight of the purple colored liquid spilling over Kakashi's fingers. Iruka turned his head away, feeling rather pathetic in his helpless position with Kakashi looming over him and fussing over something he couldn't really see. He felt the cool gel drop over his straining manhood and it made him bite his lower lip once more. The gel heated up against his already hot and begging member, making him whine like a needy virgin. He kept his eyes squeezed tight, not wanting Kakashi to see the helplessness that he was sure was mirrored in his eyes.</p><p>&quot;K-Kashi ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look at me, 'Ruka.&quot; Kakashi said, his breath against Iruka's cheek. Iruka shook his head and immediately got bitten on the jaw for refusing. &quot;Look at me!&quot;</p><p>Iruka shuddered and complied, breath hitching as he opened his eyes and slowly turned his head up, looking up at Kakashi. He could see the thick layer of lust and want in Kakashi's face, barely restrained by patience and will power. &quot;W-What -&quot;</p><p>Iruka forgot his sentence as he opened his mouth to a silent and pained scream as something large, cold and slick as forcefully pushed up his puckered and unprepared entrance. Kakashi's face wavered in front of him till the painful stretching sensation disappeared. Iruka felt something filling him and something tugging that very thing that was in him. He managed to gather enough of his wits to look up at Kakashi and attempted to glare when another large and round object was pushed in. This time, Iruka managed to cry out a bit, feeling horribly ashamed as his legs forced themselves to close in an attempt to stop the unappreciated invasion.</p><p>A large and slick hand held one of his legs in place by the thighs, a finger caressing the inner region gently in an attempt to comfort him. Iruka arched away, savagely pulling against the ropes that dug in to his wrists like hot wire as the process repeated itself over and over again until he felt something in him shudder. Iruka gasped, eyes staring widely at the ceiling as his backside felt extremely full and stretched.</p><p>&quot;You're really, really good 'Ruka. You took all five in.&quot; Kakashi whispered, hands reaching for something beside Iruka's leg as a popping noise echoed in the room. &quot;We just started and you've eagerly taken in five beads. I'm impressed.&quot;</p><p>Iruka took several minutes to understand what Kakashi was saying as cool sticky liquid started to coat his stomach. The smell of chocolate and syrup tickled his nose as his wits managed to finally form words. &quot;B-Beads? W-What b-beads?&quot;</p><p>Kakashi pushed the half empty bottle of syrup over the bed and held up a string for Iruka to see. Iruka saw how the colored plastic string was connected to the anal beads Kakashi managed to push into him. They weren't small from what he could feel and it's been a while since he indulged in anything anal-related. Iruka couldn't help but feel that Kakashi was treating him harshly.</p><p>Kakashi dropped the string on the mattress and tucked Iruka's thighs under his arms, his chest pushing Iruka's throbbing erection against his navel, going unnoticed. The contact made Iruka squirm and arch upwards, lips parting to suck in heavy, panting breaths as Kakashi started to lick the chocolate syrup he smothered Iruka's chest with. Iruka lost his ability to think once more at that moment as Kakashi rocking chest rubbed against his manhood, the hold of the rings sending waves of pleasure shooting up Iruka's spine and directly to his brain. He struggled with futile effort against the ropes as Kakashi licked his chest clean, tongue dipping in to his navel and sucking on the round jewelry before trailing up and nibbling on the nipple that donned the piercing gently with his teeth, all the while cleaning up any chocolate trails he left behind. The sensation made Iruka ejaculate prematurely, the hold of the rings and the painful feeling of being too full and not stretched enough helping the process of pushing his poor release out.</p><p>Iruka whimpered and thrashed till Kakashi made a disapproving sound and grasped his semi-soft manhood with his sticky hands. &quot;Hey, come on. Don't be like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;C-Can't - I - I need you t-to -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Later.&quot; Kakashi said firmly and started pulling at the string that connected the beads together. Iruka whimpered in pain as the beads were eased out one by one till it was all out. He sank heavily against the mattress, hands lying limp over his head and against the metal railing of the footboard, legs apart and breath coming out fast and uneven.</p><p>Iruka was about to relax and collect his wits once more when Kakashi's finger started caressing his entrance again, smearing a good amount of cold and scented lubricant over the puckered flesh. Iruka shut his eyes once more, feeling a finger probe and wiggle inside of him. He gasped and subconsciously pushed down against the finger, wanting to feel more of it.</p><p>&quot;N-Not f-fair ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like that?&quot; Kakashi asked, kissing Iruka's knee and rubbing his inner thigh with his free hand, gently massaging the firm yet tender flesh, forcing the blood back to Iruka's arousal. With each second, Iruka's manhood hardened and when it was straight and rigid enough, Kakashi pulled his finger out. &quot;Good word, baby.&quot; Kakashi whispered, trailing kisses from Iruka's knee to his inner thigh. &quot;Now, no matter what you do, don't scream.&quot;</p><p>Iruka didn't have time to understand the apparent order as he felt something larger push in to his lubricated entrance, making him grit his teeth and finally scream out from the inconsiderate force Kakashi used to shove what felt like an entire water pipe up his entrance. Tears involuntarily came up to Iruka's eyes, dripping down his temples and on the green sheets. He bit his lower lip, aggravating the cut that was already there beforehand and re-opening the already dried wound. He shivered from the pain blinding him, shaking his head from side to side.</p><p>&quot;P-Please! N-No more!&quot; Iruka begged and Kakashi silenced him by kissing him fully on the lips, licking his bleeding lips clean. Iruka heard a light click before vibrating sounds filled the room and the thing inside him wiggled and made him arch up. His feet dug in to the green bed spread, lips breaking the kiss as he screamed out at the movement going on inside of him, feet pushing downwards so that he could get away from the sensation overwhelming him.</p><p>Kakashi straddled him then, pinning him on the bed and pushing his hips down the mattress, making the phallic shaped dildo inside him push against the his spine, causing pleasure and extreme pain to mingle and render him immobile for several long minutes as his cock dripped with newly pumped out semen. Iruka shivered helplessly, legs wide apart and Kakashi's heavy weight on his hips.</p><p>&quot;Beautiful.&quot; Kakashi whispered, raining kisses all over Iruka's body and sucking on his nipple as the vibrator continued to move inside of him. Kakashi clamped his teeth over Iruka's nipple, his finger tugging on the jewelry on the other side as he bit hard, forcing a scream out of Iruka till it died down from the raw feeling that pooled at the pit of Iruka's throat. &quot;Baby, you're <i>so</i> beautiful.&quot;</p><p>Iruka's words hitched painfully in his throat, head lolling to one side as he tried to tug against the ropes once more. &quot;N-No ... please ... I - I c-can't ...&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're going to love this.&quot; Kakashi said, reaching down and increasing the vibration of the device inside of Iruka. Iruka squirmed until Kakashi grasped his length, squeezing and allowing his thumb to caress the slit of Iruka's head. &quot;You came hard last time. Can you come just as hard now? Can you come harder for me, Iruka?&quot;</p><p>Iruka grasped the rope extensions, knuckles turning white as Kakashi's eyes bore in to his body and his hand stroked his length. The hand job was irregular, sloppy and very distracted. Iruka could feel Kakashi's hardness against his stomach as the man continued to stroke him up and down, pinching the skin at the bottom of his balls hard enough for Iruka to scream again before pulling at his length a few times till Iruka couldn't hold it back.</p><p>The orgasm was lacking and incomplete but it removed the weight of the torture somewhat. Iruka felt his cock soften up a bit in Kakashi's hands as he lay still, watching the ceiling with a blank gaze and rosy parted lips. Kakashi wasn't moving on top of him for a long while, the sound of the constant vibration and their heavy breaths the only sounds filling the room. Iruka's calves and thighs remained tensed from the continuous vibration; a click sounded off and the vibration stopped. Iruka found his shoulders relaxing and the knots in his legs come lose. His cock was somehow hardening from the few short minutes of the continuous vibration but not hard enough.</p><p>Kakashi eased the vibrator out of Iruka gently, placing it on the bed and pushing it away till it landed with a thump on the floor. Iruka relaxed a bit, getting more air in to his lungs as Kakashi started to lick the traces of his release clean. The hot tongue brushing up wetly and hotly against his awakening manhood made Iruka give out a throaty whine. Kakashi's hands pushed his thighs further apart, licking every single white drop off the tanned skin in agonizing slowness till nothing was left and Iruka was hard again.</p><p>Iruka watched Kakashi through lowered lashes as Kakashi pushed his pants and boxers all the way off, leaning forward to undo the ropes on Iruka's wrist. Iruka remained confused and wondering as his hands fell limply on the bed, red and bruised from all the pulling. Kakashi tossed the ropes aside and started to kiss Iruka deeply. Iruka opened his mouth willingly, mustering enough strength in his numb arms to pull them up and wrap them around Kakashi's neck as he kissed the man back with all the passion that was cooped up in him.</p><p>Kakashi shifted so that their manhoods were pressed together and while maintaining their kiss, started to rotate his hips. Iruka could only gasp in to the kiss, fingers digging in to the Kakashi's neck as his nails left half-moon marks on the pale skin. Kakashi started to loose focus on the kiss as their arousals rubbed against each other, sending friction up their spine that blinded them both; soon it was only their gritting teeth pressed against each other till Kakashi pried his mouth open and came with a restrained groan, as Iruka raked his fingers down Kakashi's back, arching up as he came as well.</p><p>Kakashi managed to collapse on his side beside Iruka, stomach stained in white. Iruka felt the hot splatters on his chest and stomach start to cool off as he stared at the ceiling, panting again. He glanced at Kakashi several minutes later, cock semi-hard and libido still thirsty for more. Kakashi sat up and threw his legs over the edge of the bed, keeping his back to Iruka.</p><p>&quot;A-Are you d-done?&quot; Iruka asked, surprised at the lack of pleasure. While every nerve in his body was still singing, his desire wasn't quenched.</p><p>&quot;You can't take anymore. You're bleeding.&quot; Kakashi said, shoulder shuddering in the dim room as he sucked in a shaky breath.</p><p>Iruka groaned and pushed himself off the bed. He really <i>couldn't</i> move. His entire body felt like lead and a glance at the sheets between his legs told him that he was indeed bleeding a little bit. Chocolate, blood and semen mixed on the sheets; Iruka glanced to the side of the bed and noticed the green colored vibrator and anal beads lying discarded on the floor. Kakashi did keep his promise on that fact that he won't be able to move. Shifting his position was an effort on its own. Iruka's hand pressed on something by his knees and he noticed the rather large butt plug remaining unused on the soiled sheets.</p><p>What his mind conjured up then scared him, but it was enough to make his body move. &quot;I'm not done. Y-You can't l-leave m-me like this.&quot; Iruka said, determination creeping in to his eyes as he forced himself to get on all fours, taking the large butt plug and pushing his face in to the mattress, stretching his arms behind him so that he had the tip of device aimed at his entrance. He couldn't see anything but he knew that he was making one hell of a sight.</p><p>Kakashi turned to find him preparing himself, without lube and erection hanging mid air as Iruka pushed the inflatable device all the way in, screaming in to the sheets as he did so. A glance from underneath his lashes told him that he had Kakashi right where he wanted him; he was stupefied and aroused on the bed.</p><p>Iruka had to muster up all the flexibility he could find, tugging at the small pump and grasping it between his two hands.</p><p>&quot;I-Iruka! Y - You -&quot;</p><p>Iruka pressed his cheek on the mattress, facing Kakashi and raised his hips higher up in the air, hands squeezing down the small pump as he inflated the device inside him. The self inflicted pleasure blinded him and stretched him at the same time. &quot;Oh - Oh gods! Kashi! I - I - <i>oh gods</i>!&quot; Iruka squeezed the pump without thinking and screamed Kakashi's name out when he felt something inside him being caressed that sent a blinding pleasure up his spine, killing the pain on its way. Iruka started moving his hips in a manner that had Kakashi staring at him hungrily and predator like. &quot;I'm going to fucking come! I swear I -&quot;</p><p>Kakashi tugged the pump out of Iruka's hands, placed a hand on Iruka's butt cheeks and undid the screw on the pump to deflate it. Iruka whimpered at the loss of the pleasure, knees sliding down the mattress till he was lying on his stomach, face pressed firmly on the green sweat soaked sheets as Kakashi slowly eased the device out, dropping it on the floor with the rest.</p><p>&quot;You are the very, very definition of sex.&quot; Kakashi whispered, kissing the firm cheeks lightly. &quot;Can you sit up, Iruka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck me.&quot; Iruka whispered. &quot;No. Wait.&quot; Kakashi reached down and gently squeezed enough lubricant over the rings holding Iruka's release imprisoned, easing them out with difficulty that had Iruka crying out in pain. Kakashi tossed it aside when it came free, kissing Iruka gently and apologetically. &quot;Ka-Kashi?&quot;</p><p>Kakashi looked down at him. &quot;I'm sorry, baby.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Make love to me</i>.&quot;</p><p>Iruka peered from underneath his lashes to find Kakashi's expression pained as he dropped his face on Iruka's shoulders, shoulders shuddering as he wrapped his arms around Iruka in a possessive manner. &quot;Iruka. My beautiful Iruka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Make love to me</i>, Kakashi.&quot; Iruka repeated, wrapping his arms around the broad back and tightening his hold.</p><p>&quot;Can you move?&quot; Kakashi asked, suddenly hesitant.</p><p>&quot;Help me.&quot; Iruka mumbled, and Kakashi eased him back on all fours, guiding Iruka's hands to the metal railings of the bed's foot board.</p><p>&quot;See the mirror, 'Ruka?&quot; Kakashi whispered against Iruka's ear, eyes locked on the mirror across the room. Iruka could see his flushed face and sweat soaked hair that still held his loose and messy ponytail. Kakashi reached up and freed his hair, kissing the top of his head tenderly. &quot;Can you see me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-Yes.&quot; Iruka said, breathless. Kakashi looked <i>beautiful</i>. In the dim lights, his body contours was accentuated with the shadows, his lips rosy from the kiss and sweat glistening over his pale body. His eyes were thick with desire and his hair hung down in messy spiky clumps that made Iruka want thread his fingers through them and comb them back.</p><p>&quot;I'm going to watch you. And you're going to watch me. Ready, baby?&quot;</p><p>Iruka swallowed and nodded, eyes strained on the mirror as Kakashi adjusted his hips and lowered his hand to Iruka's backside to guide his hard member in to the waiting entrance. &quot;Please, Kakashi... Hurry...&quot;</p><p>From the mirror, Iruka watched as Kakashi gritted his teeth and start to push in. Iruka tilted his head back and his hands gripped the metal bars tightly as Kakashi sheathed himself neatly and easily inside of him. Iruka trembled from the heat, the sensation nothing like he felt earlier. He could feel Kakashi's pulse beat and blood flow inside him. He groaned when Kakashi shifted, causing movement inside him and sent his head back in pleasure, eyes rolling back as his chest and throat stuck out and his fingers go numb from his grip on the metal footboard.</p><p>&quot;S-So tight, 'R-Ruka ...&quot; Kakashi hissed, reaching out to press his hands against Iruka's on the railing.</p><p>Iruka didn't feel movement for very long moments till his muscles contracted and adjusted to Kakashi's very well endowed length. He never caught sight of the length but judging to how big Kakashi felt compared to the dildo and butt plug, Iruka had no doubt that it was as impressive as it felt.</p><p>&quot;M-Move!&quot; Iruka choked out, pushing his hips back and making Kakashi grunt. &quot;P-Please. H-Hurry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Baby.&quot; Kakashi hissed and rotated his hips once before pulling out. He pushed back in and it jolted Iruka forward with the force, making Iruka scream at the feeling of pleasure setting his body on fire.</p><p>&quot;H-Harder!&quot; Iruka growled, looking at the mirror beggingly at Kakashi. &quot;P-Please...&quot;</p><p>Kakashi didn't look like he could indulge in further foreplay or teasing. Iruka knew the face he was making on the mirror could make any man or woman sink on their knees and lose control of their senses. He closed his eyes, mouth parting open as Kakashi moved in and out of him, the front of his pelvis making slapping noises against Iruka's backside. Iruka wanted to feel more and not caring whether he tore more of his muscles or not, he pushed down, meeting Kakashi's every thrust with his own, hair swinging back and forth as he was jolted forward with each of Kakashi strong thrusts.</p><p>&quot;Baby - Oh gods, baby!&quot; Kakashi groaned, head lolling back as he continued to push against Iruka, hands moving down to hold on to Iruka's waist.</p><p>Iruka didn't know that he was calling out Kakashi's name with every thrust, the pattern only being broken with an occasional whimper or cry. &quot;Good ... so ... so ... good! In me ... please ... in me ...&quot;</p><p>Hoping that Kakashi would understand, Iruka squeezed his eyes shut as he pushed back hard one last time, the flow of orgasm wracking his entire body as he threw his head forward and screamed. He briefly felt Kakashi move twice inside of him before he felt something hot fill him. He'd like to think that he felt Kakashi's orgasm all the way into his stomach but he couldn't think anymore as his arms shook from the orgasm and he collapsed on the green sheets, panting and staring back at Kakashi with one eye. Kakashi had his head over his shoulder, breath coming out in hot puffs into Iruka's ear.</p><p>&quot;B-baby ... my Iruka.&quot; Kakashi mumbled, closing his eyes and tiredly lifting his head up and easing his softening erection out of Iruka's entrance, pulling a trail of sticky white with him.</p><p>&quot;Kashi ... so ... so good.&quot; Iruka whispered, closing his eyes as he allowed Kakashi to man handle him and pull him over, pillowing his damp head over the firm and muscular arm. &quot;I - I can't m-move ...&quot;</p><p>Kakashi shifted and toed the duvet over, pulling it over the both of them. &quot;Doesn't matter. I'll hold you ...&quot;</p><p>Iruka pressed his forehead against Kakashi's collarbone, barely managing to snake an arm around Kakashi as he felt Kakashi's other hand come to rest on his waist. The cooling effect of orgasm lulled Iruka to sleep, every once in a while, he'd shudder till his tingling nerves finally calmed down. He didn't know whether he fell asleep first or not, but snuggled up against Kakashi, Iruka couldn't bring himself to care.</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"" class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;--<br />&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"" class=""MsoNormal"">Fanarts and illustration can be&nbsp;found&nbsp;in my LJ user account below.&nbsp;Note that stuff will be friends-locked once more within a week or so.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;See fanarts&nbsp;etc here --&gt;</p><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://shi-chan06.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border-width: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;"" /></a><a href=""http://shi-chan06.livejournal.com/""><b>shi_chan06</b></a>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>"

Edward Elric had been quietly digesting his sandwich and pie when he overheard a group of soldiers speaking not-too-subtly about losing yet another girl friend to the Colonel. As a normal reaction, Edward immediately tuned out most of the conversation up until the phrase &lsquo;both ways&rsquo; and the title &lsquo;Colonel Mustang&rsquo; came up in one sentence. Normally, anything related to Roy Mustang was automatically tuned out, especially if it were one of the thousands of soldiers muttering or whining about losing another girlfriend. <br /><br />But why is this any different?<br /><br />Simple. Edward Elric was a curious little jitter who wanted any information available (be it solid proof or mere cafeteria gossip) to black mail the &lsquo;Bastard-Colonel&rsquo; &ndash; or so he thought. It was, to say, quite interesting to listen in on how the soldiers started discussing Roy Mustang&rsquo;s preferences might actually swing towards the male population. Their reasoning &ndash; which amused Edward to no end, and made him agree &ndash; was that after so many years of being in the military, why has Roy Mustang never settled down? There were flocks of beautiful females in both personality, looks or maybe both that would most likely appeal to the Colonel. However, even years later, there was still no improvement. And so the question remains:<br /><br />Does Roy Mustang prefer men?<br /><br />It was at this point that Edward found himself wondering about the same question and started to keep track of Roy&rsquo;s dates and affairs with the female body. Also, it seems that Roy&rsquo;s sexual preference became a popular lunch topic amongst the many soldiers during lunch time a few days later. The more Edward listened in, the more he agreed with the gossiping soldiers.<br /><br />That was when he started unconsciously pouring tea for Roy first instead of the Fuhrer.<br /><br /><br />XXX<br /><br /><br />The day Edward Elric lost control of the gates holding down his highly-suppressed-yet-very-active-and-need-of-release hormones happened on a spring afternoon, an hour before sunset just as the Fuhrer was signing the last batch of documents that would require Roy&rsquo;s attention later. Because Fuhrer Bradley had an appointment to attend to, he left Edward with the documents to be given to Roy as he bid his pleasant goodbyes and left the vicinity in his private car. <br /><br />On normal occasions, it wouldn&rsquo;t really have mattered if Edward had to give a post-it note to Roy or if it were a box full of papers. But after the particular joke earlier on in the cafeteria of Roy taking what he wants from his prey on that large desk of his, Edward found himself avoiding eye contact with anything that was associated with the word &lsquo;desk&rsquo;. Also, he avoided looking at Roy at all times, even when he still poured tea for him first. Ever since lunch, he&rsquo;s been getting the flutter in his belly whenever he saw a desk or heard Roy&rsquo;s name. <br /><br />So it was minutes later, when Edward knocked on Roy&rsquo;s office door, carrying a folder with a bunch of stapled papers within did his face suddenly turn the shade of a ripe cherry.<br /><br />&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Roy replied, voice in its usual deep baritone with the smugness that was ever present.<br /><br />Edward entered, closed the door behind him and decided that the window behind Roy&rsquo;s head was way more interesting to look at rather than the man himself or the desk. If possible, he looked a tad bit redder than a ripe cherry; maybe it was over-ripe cherry. <br /><br />&ldquo;Fuhrer left this for you. He had to leave early to attend to an appointment. He says he trusts that you will take care of it.&rdquo; Edward said, really not looking at Roy. <br /><br />&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Roy took the folder and set it aside, quite amused to see the shade on Edward&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter Edward? The weather isn&rsquo;t even remotely hot.&rdquo; <br /><br />Edward made a face at remark. It was at this point did Roy finally came to his proper field of vision, along with his very large desk. Sturdy, mahogany, rose wood desk; one of the finest, or so the word goes. The reaction was quite immediate in relation with Edward&rsquo;s already raging hormones. A somewhat strangled &lsquo;meep&rsquo; sound managed to escape the blonde&rsquo;s lips.<br /><br />Roy was most definitely amused, because if possible, the smirk on his face got even wider. Word got to him fast and he knows what is being said about him; he knew perfectly well about the gossip that spread like wildfire in the cafeteria, especially about the &lsquo;desk thing&rsquo;. <br /><br />&ldquo;I &ndash; I should get going, if there&rsquo;s nothing else.&rdquo; Edward mumbled, trying vainly to hide his already flushed face from the scrutiny Roy was directing at him.<br /><br />Roy&rsquo;s tone dropped down a notch, as he stood and rounded the desk and head for the door, locking it. &ldquo;Maybe later.&rdquo;<br /><br />How it happened, Edward didn&rsquo;t know. <br /><br />Two seconds ago, Roy was by the door. A few strides later, half the contents of the mahogany desk were shoved aside with a gloved hand while Edward found himself being pushed against it. Whatever sense of control &ndash; despite it being very small and unstable &ndash; Edward had of his senses quickly disappeared when Roy pinned him by the shoulders on the smooth desk, lips crushing against his. <br /><br />It took a mere second for Edward to realize that Roy Mustang was kissing him and that there was a set of teeth nibbling at his lower lip. Edward hungrily opened his mouth, purely thinking with his second-lower-head rather than his brain as he sucked in Roy&rsquo;s tongue in to his mouth, eyes drifting shut as Roy continued to kiss him with raw passion. Edward&rsquo;s hands crawled up Roy&rsquo;s broad back, pulling off the gloves that he normally wore and tossing it to one side to thread fingers against the soft raven locks, pulling, tugging and just feeling its smoothness. The cool metallic feel of the automail against Roy&rsquo;s scalp, temples and neck made him groan deeply in to the kiss, breaking only for a second to suck in a breath before clamping down against Edward&rsquo;s already bruised and rosy-hued lips. <br /><br />By the second kiss, Edward was long gone. He felt Roy&rsquo;s gloved hands trail down the front of his uniform to undo the buttons and push the blue clothing off lithe shoulders while Edward himself busied his fingers with trying to undo the small clasps on the collar of Roy&rsquo;s uniform. Roy roughly pulled back against the kiss, pulling Edward up from the desk and shoving him against the wall beside the window.<br /><br />&ldquo;Take that off.&rdquo; Roy growled, glaring at the bulky uniform Edward was wearing. Edward complied, finding himself taken and quite obedient to the tone Roy was using, as excited trembling fingers shakily tried to undo the buttons of his white under shirt &ndash; with very little succession. Roy growled louder as he grabbed the under shirt collar and pulled, the buttons popping and flying all over the office. <br /><br />&ldquo;My shirt! Damnit, Roy!&rdquo; Edward snapped, staring at one of the buttons lying on top of the desk. Edward found himself gasping when Roy cupped a gloved hand against his groin, squeezing none too gently while another gloved hand came to undo the buckle of Edward&rsquo;s pants. Edward gave out a strangled cry, hands pressing behind him &ndash; one on the wall, and one on the window sill. <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Colonel, Edward.&rdquo; Roy corrected, and shoved the pants past Edward&rsquo;s waist before grabbing the automail arm and pinning it above Edward&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Remember that.&rdquo; He hissed before pushing Edward further up the wall and ravishing his exposed neck with hard nibbles and sensual licks.<br /><br />Edward shamelessly groaned, tilting his head back as far as it can go, making begging little noises. Roy&rsquo;s mouth, tongue and teeth busied itself with the hollow or Edward&rsquo;s neck, leaving markings that claimed Edward as Roy&rsquo;s property while Edward deftly tried to kick his boots off and free his ankles from the confinement of his pants. He was wiggling and writhing against Roy, unintentionally rubbing up and down the toned chest and slim waist of the brunette while he tried to struggled off his pants and boots. As Edward&rsquo;s thigh came brushing against Roy&rsquo;s already swelling groin, Roy breathed a moan loudly, while his teeth sank in to one Edward&rsquo;s nipples. <br /><br />A small scream escaped Edward&rsquo;s throat as he whimpered and begged for more, successfully kicking his pants away. He stood naked in front of Roy, save for the ruined white under shirt and blue army top that hang around his shoulders. Roy was smirking and licking the red bud in between his teeth while Edward arched up against him, wanting the pain in his lower belly to disappear. His straining erection begged and wept for release, making Edward shamelessly rub against Roy&rsquo;s thigh once again, in hopes to ease the growing tension if only for a little bit. <br /><br />Roy pulled back to look at Edward, who had his automail limb held up by one of Roy&rsquo;s hands and the other one white at the knuckles from gripping the window sill too hard. Edward&rsquo;s ponytail was disarray and loose from being grinded against the desk and wall. Lips were a now a deeper shade of red and his cheeks were flushed. Roy&rsquo;s teeth and kiss marks littered Edward&rsquo;s neck and chest, ensuring future itchiness. Golden eyes stared in to Roy&rsquo;s dark ones, coated with lust and begging for release. Roy had to smirk as he brought one of his gloved hand to his lips to bite at the material and pull it off. He did the same with the other hand before running the said hand down Edward&rsquo;s smooth chest to his waist, making Edward toss his head slowly to one side, a shaky moan escaping those red lips. Roy smirked yet again and pulled back to pull his blue uniform off and undo the first few buttons of his shirt.<br /><br />Edward&rsquo;s eyes came to rest beggingly on those hands that moved smoothly over the expanse of blue that was slowly peeled away and set on the chair. Edward swallowed, staring at between Roy&rsquo;s legs as Roy placed warm hands on his shoulders.<br /><br />&ldquo;On your knees.&rdquo; Roy said, smirking. Edward obeyed, sliding against the wall to get on his knees and nimbly look up at Roy. One of those smooth and warm hands grabbed Edward&rsquo;s ponytail and yanked it free, causing Edward to yelp and give out a whimper as the elastic hair band was tossed aside. Said warm fingers grabbed Edward by the hair and pulled his face closer towards Roy&rsquo;s impressive and well hung length. &ldquo;Get to it.&rdquo; Roy said, looking very smug.<br /><br />Edward raised both his hands, curious to have a go at the straining muscle before him. Roy gave an impatient sharp pull against Edward&rsquo;s hair before Edward opened his mouth and shyly took the tip in his mouth. Roy made a hissing noise at the base of his throat before Edward found himself gripping Roy by the waist with his automail limb and licking at the tip the best he can. Roy&rsquo;s grip on his hair only tightened as he pushed Edward against the wall, hips moving forward to gain more heat from Edward&rsquo;s willing mouth. Edward could only react with a whimper as his mouth was pried open wider than it usually would, more and more of the length filling him and brushing against the back of his throat. Edward whimpered louder, trying to wrench his face away but Roy held him in place. Tears gathered at the corner of Edward&rsquo;s eyes as he shut them tight, trying to work around the muscle in his mouth till he found a correct way to accommodate all of it without choking. It seemed that his speed for wallowing down food came in handy in developing his gag reflex because minutes later, after struggling and wriggling to no avail against Roy&rsquo;s grinding hips, Edward was bobbing his own head; each bob being accompanied by a throaty groan while Roy tilted his head back, the setting sun glowing against Roy&rsquo;s pleasured features. Edward had his eyes tightly shut and it was only when both of Roy&rsquo;s hands grabbed the sides of his head and something bitter shot down his throat did he stare widely at the waist in front of him, as Roy breathed out a deep groan and pulled back.<br /><br />White fluid dribbled down Edward&rsquo;s lips as he coughed and sputtered at the bitter and burning sensation that slithered down his throat. The back of his blonde head was aching from being grinded against the wall, while Roy moved to lean shamelessly against his deck, erection growing limp from the release. Edward wondered if that was all Roy wanted.<br /><br />&ldquo;Are we done?&rdquo; Edward asked, almost sounding a bit disappointed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Give me a minute, Edward.&rdquo; Roy whispered, sucking in shaky breaths as the bliss of orgasm washed over him. &ldquo;So your mouth is capable of other things other than shouting.&rdquo; Roy teased, grinning quite broadly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you &ndash;&ldquo; Edward didn&rsquo;t have the time to finish his sentence before Roy grabbed him from one side of his collar and dragged him around the table to the carpet in the middle of the office. &ldquo;R - Ro &ndash; C - Colonel!&rdquo; He whimpered, being pushed against the carpet, while Roy leaned over him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Amazing you even remember my title. Seeing as how you&rsquo;re loosing your mind due to this.&rdquo; Roy ran a finger teasingly down Edward&rsquo;s erection that looked like it was ready to burst. A sadistic part of Roy wanted to make sure that Edward wouldn&rsquo;t walk straight for the next few days. Just the mere thought was changing the course of his blood flow and heading southwards once again. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; Edward hissed, impatient as his hips arched in to that teasing touch.<br /><br />&ldquo;So eager.&rdquo; Roy mused, slapping at Edward&rsquo;s thigh so it left a hand print and earned a rather loud yelp from Edward&rsquo;s mouth. <br /><br />&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Edward gritted out reaching out and grabbing Roy by the neck and pulling him down so that they lay pressed against each other on the floor while Edward kissed Roy&rsquo;s lips. The sticky dribble that was the result from Roy&rsquo;s first release turned in to some sort of toffee as it was passed to each other until Edward swallowed upon reflex. <br /><br />Roy pulled back grinning down at Edward&rsquo;s sweaty face and damp hair. &ldquo;I see that I&rsquo;m your flavor.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Bitter and sour. It&rsquo;s so you.&rdquo; Edward retorted only to be kissed hungrily once more by Roy&rsquo;s eager mouth while his hand moved down to pump at Edward&rsquo;s erection, finally giving it the attention it deserved. Edward bucked and writhed under Roy&rsquo;s broader frame while his mouth was abused passionately once more. It didn&rsquo;t take long for Edward to buckle, wrench his mouth of the kiss and cry out with a strangled almost-sob-like sound as his release was granted by Roy&rsquo;s hand. Edward slumped bonelessly against the woolen beige carpet, staring hazily at Roy who was grinning down at him. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Edward mumbled.<br /><br />Roy brought a sticky white coated hand up to Edward&rsquo;s face, smearing some of the fluid over Edward&rsquo;s mouth. Edward&rsquo;s cry of release hardened Roy fully, as if the earlier blow job didn&rsquo;t even happen. Edward watched wordlessly with his hazy eyes as Roy smeared the whiteness some more on his chin before lifting the hand and running a tongue up one finger. The word &lsquo;shameless&rsquo; came to Edward&rsquo;s mind that was followed by words like &lsquo;sexy&rsquo;, &lsquo;hot&rsquo; and &lsquo;erotic&rsquo;.<br /><br />&ldquo;Tangy. Just like you.&rdquo; Roy said, smacking his lips and grinding his waist against Edward once more so as to make the blonde aware that they were far from done and that Roy&rsquo;s member now needed another round of attention. A funny sounding throaty groan came out of Edward&rsquo;s parted lips as Roy ran his tongue up from Edward&rsquo;s chin to his mouth, pushing the white stickiness past those rosy-red lips and exploring the mouth and caverns once more. Like before, Edward swallowed upon reflex, making Roy smile in to the kiss as he deepened it, his previously sticky hand moving down Edward&rsquo;s thighs and leaving trails of white as fingers deftly prodded the entrance.<br /><br />Edward broke the kiss, staring wide eyed at Roy. &ldquo;Wha &ndash; What?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be satisfied with a simple blow job did you?&rdquo; Roy asked, quickly and quite harshly pushing a finger into Edward&rsquo;s entrance.<br /><br />Edward wriggled away but Roy held him in place firmly, fingers digging deeply in to Edward&rsquo;s waist. If it dug any deeper, nails would have broken the skin and Edward would be bleeding. &ldquo;Nn &ndash; But &ndash; you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Roy asked, wiggling his finger inside Edward, pushing it further in. <br /><br />&ldquo;You &ndash; ah!&rdquo; Edward buckled, screaming quite loudly as Roy wordlessly and without warning pushed a second finger in. The stickiness of Edward&rsquo;s initial release proved to be quite hindering since it seemed to act like glue around Edward&rsquo;s entrance and Roy&rsquo;s fingers. Not that it bothered Roy one bit as he started pushing his fingers apart to stretch Edward some more. <br /><br />&ldquo;When we&rsquo;re over, you&rsquo;ll be begging for more.&rdquo; Roy said smugly as Edward whimpered louder and tried to edge away from the violating fingers. Roy deftly spread his legs out behind him so that he can lean down and gave Edward&rsquo;s limp organ a slow lick. Roy was not disappointed by the noise Edward gave out as the member slowly and gradually stiffed with every slow lick Roy provided it. Some of Edward&rsquo;s essence remained at the tip of Roy&rsquo;s tongue but he wasn&rsquo;t one to complain. It was rare to find Edward so willingly wanting to be touched by him no less. <br /><br />Once Edward&rsquo;s member was standing tall and proud, Roy rammed in two more fingers to spread the entrance wider. Edward&rsquo;s scream bounced against his office walls and he was not the least bit bothered. When he locked his door, no one dared disturb him unless it was Edward himself. <br /><br />The setting sun behind Roy&rsquo;s back illuminated the beads of sweat on Edward&rsquo;s front and on his own back and thighs. The painful tears forming in Edward&rsquo;s eyes made Roy look down at him with almost no emotion, as Edward stared helplessly and in pain up at him, breathing coming out in ragged breaths. Roy almost &ndash; almost &ndash; fell then. He smirked down at Edward and pulled his fingers away slowly, watching as Edward threw his head to one side and whimper some more, biting his lower lip hard enough that it could draw blood any second. Roy bent forward and licked those red lips, shaking his head at Edward.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bite too hard or it&rsquo;ll bleed.&rdquo; He warned and rubbed at Edward&rsquo;s waist in comforting little circles that earned that hazy glow within those golden eyes.<br /><br />&ldquo;Like it&rsquo;ll make a difference to you.&rdquo; Edward said, almost bitterly but the want there cannot be ignored.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh it will.&rdquo; Roy said, smirking and grabbing Edward&rsquo;s flesh leg and lifting it up. &ldquo;It will, Edward. Believe me.&rdquo; Edward could only blink in reply as he watched Roy hoist his flesh limb over his broad uniformed shoulder. &ldquo;Spread your other leg.&rdquo; Roy whispered, kissing Edward&rsquo;s knee cap that was over his shoulder as Edward complied. <br /><br />Edward&rsquo;s chest was thundering as Roy shifted and pushed against his entrance, face contracting in to a tensed expression, more beads of sweat forming on the temples as Roy deftly pushed his hardness in to Edward. Edward made a throaty sound of protest as he was invaded bit by bit before Roy just pushed in with one swift thrust. Edward, at this point, started to wonder why he was even doing this or why he was even allowing it.<br /><br />Roy was smiling down at him when he was at his most painful and vulnerable position. &ldquo;That hurts!&rdquo; Edward managed to choke out; the carpet under him was digging in to his back and rubbing hotly that it gave him the odd feeling of having blisters and sunburns. The invasion felt like Edward was being torn in half and the carpet burns weren&rsquo;t making things any better.<br /><br />&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to walk after this.&rdquo; Roy said with that almost-silly smile on his face.<br /><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Edward demanded, eyes going unbelievably wide as he stared at Roy like the man had a penguin on his head.<br /><br />&ldquo;You heard me.&rdquo; Roy said, grunting as he pulled out and pushed in to Edward, this time it was easier and it earned him a scream. Edward&rsquo;s hands dug in to Roy&rsquo;s shoulders, eyes tightly shut at the pain filled him. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to walk.&rdquo; Roy pulled back and pushed in as hard as he can and this time, it wasn&rsquo;t a scream he got. It was a silent throaty parting of Edward&rsquo;s lips in a wide &lsquo;oh&rsquo; as the golden eyes turned hazy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure of that.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Roy.&rdquo; Edward breathed out and this made Roy pushed up against him harder. Edward moaned loudly and threw his head back before managing to look at Roy, no longer caring if he felt liked being ripped in half or if his back felt like it was on fire. &ldquo;Move!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What did you call me?&rdquo; Roy demanded, pushing even further till the front of his hips was pressed against Edward&rsquo;s buttocks firmly. <br /><br />&ldquo;Roy. Roy.&rdquo; Edward begged, whimpered and groaned shamelessly loud. &ldquo;Colonel!&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Roy asked, smug of course.<br /><br />&ldquo;Move! Damnit! Just move already!&rdquo; Edward screamed, yelled and glared at Roy, slightly pushing himself up and grinding his hips down against the man on top of him.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no position to give orders, Secretary.&rdquo; Roy teased, as Edward contracted under him, nearly making him see stars as the younger man&rsquo;s temper quickly sky rocketed. The tightness was so overwhelming that Roy himself was wondering why he was still not moving. The lack of movement made Edward beg and claw at Roy&rsquo;s shoulder blades. Even the automail felt strangely hot.<br /><br />&ldquo;Damnit! Please Colonel! Colonel!&rdquo; Edward repeated, begging with half lidded eyes. Roy wriggled his hips and repeated his earlier hard thrust one more time, making Edward throw his head back yet again and breathe out deep throaty moans. &ldquo;More, Colonel! Colonel! Please, oh god Colonel! More!&rdquo;<br /><br />Roy gritted his teeth as his fingers dug in to Edward&rsquo;s thigh, hips moving in fast and hard rocking motions that left Edward pinned to the ground and his hips bobbing from the motions Roy was inflicting upon him. The room filled with the sounds of Edward&rsquo;s incoherent vowel pronunciations as Roy pounded in to his entrance, lifting Edward&rsquo;s hips higher up for more leverage. Roy didn&rsquo;t stop and moved in and out as hard as he can, making sure that Edward would not sit nor stand or walk properly without the visible strain. <br /><br />There was a sharp knock on the door that made Roy see red. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy! Come back later!&rdquo; He gritted out loudly and full of frustration before the sounds of scampering footsteps hurried down the hall.<br /><br />Edward didn&rsquo;t even seem to care anymore for his fingers were ready to break the skin on Roy&rsquo;s shoulders from gripping too hard. The tightness and heat overwhelmed Roy that he barely remembered to grip Edward&rsquo;s straining shaft to pump it as hard as his thrusts were, until Edward&rsquo;s scream filled the room and Roy&rsquo;s chest suddenly felt warm and sticky. <br /><br />A few more hard thrusts against Edward and Roy bucked in his release, coming hard and long and filling Edward. He gave a short and bitten down cry as orgasm washed over him before he slumped against Edward. It took minutes before Roy pulled out of Edward slowly and lay on his back, the sun&rsquo;s last violet rays disappearing from the sky as evening came.<br /><br />&ldquo;You ruined my uniform, ass.&rdquo; Edward bit out, lifting a finger to the collar of his under shirt that was now damp and sticky around his shoulders. In the middle of Roy&rsquo;s thrusts, it had gathered up around his neck and shoulder blades. Edward had no doubt that the middle of his back would be red and blistering from rubbing and rocking against the carpet. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as soiled as you are.&rdquo; Roy said, smiling and just plainly satisfied. <br /><br />Silence fell after that.<br /><br />It was only when the loud knock on the door, did both of them blink and semi-sit up from their lying positions on the carpet to look at the door behind their heads.<br /><br />&ldquo;Colonel, the documents you have requested have arrived from the western headquarters.&rdquo; Hawkeye&rsquo;s clipped tone sounded from beyond the wooden doors.<br /><br />Roy got to his feet and started arranging and straightening his clothes and wiping his hands clean before running his fingers through his hair in an attempt to look less disheveled. He pushed open the windows to air the stuffy office before grabbing Edward by the collar of his uniform and straightening it the best he can. Edward winced painfully, barely able to suppress the painful whimper that came out of his lips from the pull and at sudden movement of his legs. Edward&rsquo;s backside, as Roy thought, was as red as the ball pen sitting on one of his pen holders on the desk. <br /><br />&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand can you?&rdquo; Roy asked, fixing the blue-top uniform for Edward and pulling the white undershirt. Wordlessly, Roy helped Edward in to his pants and boots for Edward himself was gripping the side of the desk in an iron grip in an attempt to remain standing without collapsing. <br /><br />&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Edward gritted out as Roy stood behind him and started straightening his hair out. Both of them dully noted that they would need to take a long bath later.<br /><br />&ldquo;But you were so good, Edward.&rdquo; Roy whispered huskily as he took the hair tie from his desk that he picked up earlier and tied Edward&rsquo;s hair up. &ldquo;So, so good.&rdquo; Roy teased more, nipping at Edward&rsquo;s ear that made the blonde blush deeper. <br /><br />&ldquo;Colonel!&rdquo; Another sharp knock from the door as Hawkeye&rsquo;s impatient tone from beyond the door.<br /><br />&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;m done with you. Now get out.&rdquo; Roy said.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ass.&rdquo; Edward mumbled. <br /><br />&ldquo;Only yours appeals to me.&rdquo; Roy winked and just for the hell of it, he pinched one of Edward&rsquo;s butt cheeks that was already painful from the carpet burns and the previous ministrations. Edward limped towards the door, opening and looking very strained, as Roy watched with a smirk of grave satisfaction.<br /><br />Hawkeye&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t waver as Edward pulled the door open, gave her a tight greeting and limped down the hall towards his desk on the third floor to clear up for the day. If Hawkeye caught sight of the white smears on the carpet and floor on the window, or the mess of papers on the front of Roy&rsquo;s desk, she did not say anything. <br /><br />&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Hawkeye said, as she set the papers on the desk. &ldquo;You have a meeting tomorrow and those need your immediate attention.&rdquo; She gestured to the papers.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Roy said, not the least bit perturbed that his uniform was stained and crumpled. Neither was Hawkeye for she left the office wordlessly &ndash; most probably because she didn&rsquo;t really care. Roy could only laugh as he finished his paper work for the evening.<br /><br /><br />XXX<br /><br /><br />When Edward got home later that night, Alphonse fussed over him like a mother hen. Edward merely told him that he slipped and lost his footing hence he slightly pulled a few muscles to explain his painful limping. Edward then spent more than hour soaked in a hot bath until he fell asleep. By the time he woke up, the water was cold already. He didn&rsquo;t even have the energy to have dinner and merely told Alphonse that he was going to bed.<br /><br />Since that day, Edward has been taking long hot baths and falling asleep in the bathtub till the water turned cold. Not that it was intentional, but with it came him feeling too tired and getting sick. <br /><br />Of course, he&rsquo;d never admit it out loud that it was Roy&rsquo;s fault.<br /><br />Once Edward recovered from his fever and he was as chipper and healthy as a bird, he went back to his duties with a skip in his steps. He still poured tea first for Roy then the Fuhrer. <br /><br /><br />XXX<br /><br /><br />Two weeks after the incident in Roy&rsquo;s office, Roy received a small note. The handwriting was not unfamiliar. Once lunch time came, Roy stood from his desk and left his office.<br /><br />The note said:<br /><br />I have useful information for you. Come to the resource room at lunch time and I&rsquo;ll show you how useful it is.<br /><br />Roy looked smug, strict and probably &lsquo;emotionless&rsquo; as he climbed the steps to the last floor of the building. The look on his face, as Breda, Fury, Havoc and Farman knew was the expression he usually wore when he had a &lsquo;date&rsquo;.<br /><br />Roy knew that this information would indeed be very useful.<br /><br />After all, since when did Edward Elric disappoint him?<br /><br /><br /><br />FIN<br /><br /><br />Uh yeah. Done.</p></div>"

He had to blink several times as he stood up to his feet slowly, rubbing the side of his aching neck from leaning against the couch armrest for too long. The bones on Iruka&rsquo;s shoulders cricked as he stretched, looking around his living room warily. <p>&ldquo;Iruka?&rdquo; Genma emerged from the small hallway, closing the bathroom door quietly. &ldquo;Did I wake you?&rdquo;</p><p>Iruka smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;No. My neck did though.&rdquo;</p><p>Without saying another word, Genma was at his side, rubbing the tensed muscles around Iruka&rsquo;s neck and shoulders, easing firm circles with his cool fingers. &ldquo;I was going to wake you up to shift over to the bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is useless now.&rdquo; Iruka said, leaning against the fingers some more as he cast a tired glance at the clock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seven in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Genma shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the weekend. You're off duty as Hokage-sama ordered and I have night-watch duty with Raidou tonight.

His neck was feeling much better.</p><p>Genma stopped moving his fingers, ghosting them over Iruka&rsquo;s shoulders and turning him around. Golden eyes reflected concern and genuine sincerity. &ldquo;So should you.&rdquo; Genma said softly, in a way as if his lips never moved; as if they were but a wind&rsquo;s whisper.</p><p>Iruka leaned against Genma&rsquo;s forehead, lightly kissing the corner of his lips. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why do you look so tensed? Why is it every time I look at your face, it&rsquo;s as if you have the weight of the world on your head? Why is it that I feel that while every one of us is chilling, you&rsquo;re in some boiling pit?&rdquo; Genma asked, not angrily, but with fear. He moved to pillow his head against Iruka&rsquo;s warm shoulder.</p><p>Iruka would have laughed, but he found that he couldn&rsquo;t. Not when he could see the Jounin before him so afraid; so small. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>not that</i> bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ever seen a mirror?&rdquo; Genma snaked his hands around Iruka.</p><p>Iruka smiled. &ldquo;I need it to shave, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Genma said nothing but pulled Iruka with him towards the wall mirror in Iruka&rsquo;s bedroom. Iruka allowed Genma to lead him, to do what he wants, hoping that maybe this will somehow ease the other man&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; Genma pointed at the mirror, with what seemed to be a slightly shaking finger. Iruka remained where he was standing, looking at his reflection and smiled. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p><p>Iruka blinked, reaching out behind him to wrap an arm around Genma&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re worrying over some silly little reflection, Genma.&rdquo;</p><p>Genma traced the barely visible lines of stress at the corners of Iruka&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Look harder.&rdquo;</p><p>Iruka found himself focusing on his eyes, dark pools of brown that reminded him of just how much he&rsquo;s lost, yet gained at the same time; how much he&rsquo;s seen and could not stop, yet how much he&rsquo;s made happy and safe. Iruka couldn&rsquo;t see any new signs of aging save for the ones he already knew were present like the slight crinkle at the corner of his eyes. If any, it was his eyes that mirrored his age.</p><p>&ldquo;I see too much Genma.&rdquo; Iruka said, sounding like he just got home from an unending war.</p><p>Genma&rsquo;s gaze pierced in to his through the mirror. &ldquo;You see? I don&rsquo;t understand why you have to suffer when there are people around you who&rsquo;ll gladly share the burden.&rdquo;</p><p>Iruka knew Genma meant well, but this time, he couldn&rsquo;t look at Genma anymore. Genma didn&rsquo;t know what kind of science his brain worked for him to see his visions. Genma didn&rsquo;t know the amount of headache it caused in the long run. Iruka knew he&rsquo;d pay the price of having such ability and he had a sinking feeling that when the time of payment comes, he&rsquo;ll never know what hit him.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no burden.&rdquo; Iruka reached up and pulled the hands that were resting on his shoulders, turning to face the Jounin. &ldquo;There never was. What gave you the idea that I was,&rdquo; Iruka chuckled a bit. &ldquo;Burdened?&rdquo; Genma didn&rsquo;t reply but looked away instead. Iruka cupped a cheek with a hand and made Genma face him again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here. If there ever was such a burden, Genma, you being here makes it all easier. Feather weight.&rdquo;</p><p>Genma, for all his graces, blushed. &ldquo;Iruka.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am thankful that I have you. Because,&rdquo; Iruka leaned against Genma&rsquo;s chest, eyes closing, listening to his heartbeat, basking in the knowledge that Genma was alive and with him at that very moment. &ldquo;Because, every time I know that you are alive, that you&rsquo;re breathing, I can rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Genma didn&rsquo;t know how deep the words went but he knew sincerity and he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from claiming the other man&rsquo;s lips and holding him close to his chest. Iruka let himself be claimed, melting in to the man's arms. Genma dragged his lips away from Iruka's towards his jaw line, eyes tightly shut. He was frustrated.</p><p>&quot;The way you speak. It's like &ndash; I don't know.&quot; Genma dropped his head on Iruka's shoulder.</p><p>&quot;Like what?&quot; Iruka asked softly, hand coming up to caress Genma's slightly tangled hair.</p><p>&quot;It's like you're leaving. Not coming back.&quot; Genma mumbled in to Iruka's shoulder, arms around the Chuunin's waist tightening in to a very possessive hold. &quot;Like you're tired of living.&quot;</p><p>Iruka laughed which later faded. &quot;Sometimes. But I can't give up now, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't even think about it.&quot; Genma grabbed Iruka by the arms and looked at him for a long time. &quot;I can't understand you.&quot;</p><p>Iruka was not disturbed by Genma's grip on his arms. &quot;People say I'm like an open book.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They say so. I used to think so.&quot; Genma led Iruka to the bed, slowly with small steps.</p><p>&quot;Then you must be able to read me.&quot;</p><p>The back of Iruka's legs hit the side of his bed. He lowered himself, Genma crawling over him and pillowing Iruka's head with his hand. Iruka could feel Genma warm thighs pressed against his sides as the elder man peered down at him, studying him and trying to understand. Iruka remained motionless on the bed, his cheeks coloring slightly in the dim room at Genma's close proximity.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Genma spoke quietly, pulling a pillow and replacing his hand with it so that Iruka was slightly elevated. &quot;When I look at you, it would seem like you're just being you. The normal you. The Sensei everybody loves and adores.&quot; Genma dragged his fingers lightly over Iruka's eyes, feeling the soft folds of the Chuunin's eyelashes before moving on to trace the scar on his nose. &quot;But when I really look at you, at your eyes, it's like staring in to a vast space. A space with so many things.&quot;</p><p>Iruka had to shut his eyes then. If Genma knew how hard he's hit home, he'd be very surprised.</p><p>&quot;You see more than the Sharingan. More than the Byakugan. You understand more.&quot; Genma said with undertones of accusation. &quot;Look at me Iruka.&quot;</p><p>Iruka didn't move.</p><p>&quot;Look at me!&quot;</p><p>Iruka opened his eyes but his pupils remained looking off to one side, where he can see Genma's arm rather than his face. &quot;Sometimes, I don't want to open my eyes any more. And one day, I will pay for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Genma blinked.</p><p>&quot;I'm not sure.&quot; Iruka forced a smile that faded almost as fast as it came. &quot;One day, you'll understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What if I'm already dead then?&quot;</p><p>Iruka closed his eyes. &quot;I doubt so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How sure can you be?&quot; Genma asked, hard edge to his voice.</p><p>&quot;I just know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How can you gamble with death?&quot;</p><p>Iruka has been playing with lives for as long as he can remember. Sometimes, he had to make choices. His visions clashed several times with lives on the line and he hated choosing who he had to save and who he had to leave behind. It was the Third that reminded him at times when he felt at the edges of his sanity that he can't save everyone.</p><p>&quot;I don't.&quot; Iruka lied.</p><p>Genma pulled him in a fierce embrace. &quot;Liar!&quot;</p><p>Iruka understood Genma's frustration and he let it fly over his head. He ignored the accusations and how hard Genma's fingers dug in to his back that surely it'd leave bruises later. He remained quiet till Genma calmed down, opting to just caress his hair once more. It was like when he held Mizuki back then. Whenever the man was frustrated, he'd caress his head, threading his fingers through his hair. Same went with Naruto during the days when the burden placed on him and village's hatred got the best of him.</p><p>Iruka decided that perhaps it would be better to lie just a bit more to cover up for things he can't explain. He was generally an honest person and avoided lies. But seeing Genma now and how his back was starting to ache that it made wince and bite his lower lip, he decided that a little more lying wouldn't kill.</p><p>&quot;Things will work out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're speaking that way again!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Genma, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.&quot; Iruka wrapped his arms around Genma's head, slowly reversing their positions so that Genma was lying down. &quot;I don't plan to go anywhere. Never did. Where would I go?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You keep too many secrets.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We all have secrets. I just learned to never ask.&quot; Iruka leaned down and kissed Genma's temple. &quot;Because I don't want to ask. And I won't ask for yours. I don't want to know what you stole as a child, what you did years ago and what sins you've committed. I don't want to know of your dark side, because the Genma I like, the Genma that I fell for,&quot; Iruka leaned and kissed Genma lightly on the lips. &quot;The Genma I love, is right here. What's important is now.&quot;</p><p>Genma's lips thinned, a sure sign that he was stopping himself from arguing. &quot;And the future?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let it unfold by itself.&quot;</p><p>Genma closed his eyes as Iruka kissed him again, deepening what started soft and slow, till they were both trying to mesh themselves together. Iruka kept his hands busy, pushing Genma's shirt up and breaking their kiss to pull the shirt off completely and shoving it aside. Genma wrapped his arms around Iruka's waist as Iruka adjusted himself so that he was straddling Genma more comfortably and returned to kissing him again.</p><p>Genma had to break the kiss himself to breathe; a large heavy gasp that left him choking for a brief second, making him blink away the black spots he was starting to see just as Iruka pulled back to get rid of his own shirt. His hair dropped down his shoulders just as Iruka got rid of the shirt neckline and discarded it. Genma watched as Iruka slid down a bit to undo his pants so that he was straddling him naked.</p><p>&quot;Oh god, Iruka.&quot; Genma had to remember how to breathe. Iruka dipped his head and pulled at Genma's pants standing up from the bed and undressing the Jounin completely. It embarrassed the Jounin for some reason that he was completely aroused and weeping for attention.</p><p>Iruka leaned over Genma once more and kissed the corner of his lips. &quot;Breathe deeply.&quot; Iruka grinned. &quot;I'll make you forget your worries.&quot;</p><p>Genma couldn't stop the little whine that escaped his throat at slyness of Iruka's words. He momentarily forgot what he was thinking when Iruka kissed his neck. He couldn't stop his own body from shuddering and arching up for more. Hands fisted on the sheets as Iruka kept working on his body with his lips, leaving small marks on his chest and sides, and large ones on his neck.</p><p>&quot;I hope you have high collared shirts.&quot; Iruka mumbled in to Genma's jawline, hand playing with a nipple.</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot; Genma choked out and later groaned when Iruka sucked on his Adam's apple.</p><p>&quot;What would people say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who the fuck cares!&quot; Genma shuddered and groaned loudly, throwing his head back and tugging at the sheets harder, leaving the bed completely messed up.</p><p>Iruka didn't say anything to Genma's reply and instead slid down to take care of Genma's arousal. He started with his hands, leaving Genma struggling to breathe. Genma could hardly believe that Iruka was so good with his hands and mouth that it suffocated him. He loved it and was completely mesmerized by Iruka's movements.</p><p>Iruka offered Genma a quick lick that made Genma shiver and suck in a large breath. Pleased by the reaction, Iruka proceeded to take Genma in to his mouth. It's been a long while since he got intimate with someone, so he had to adjust to the feeling to his mouth being full and at the same time keep up in his ability to suck. He found a rhythm and was starting to taste the bitter leakage of pre-orgasm that he quickly jerked his head back, stopping Genma from his release.</p><p>Genma could not stop the hiss and the small whine at the back of throat at the loss.</p><p>&quot;Not yet.&quot; Iruka kissed Genma's folded knees and moved on top of the bed, pushing Genma's legs back and slightly apart. He caught the wide eyed look Genma threw at him at the understanding of what was going to happen. Iruka kept eye contact, shifting one of Genma's legs over his shoulder as he brought his fingers to his mouth and began to lick it wet.</p><p>The wide eyed look Genma had aimed at him previously quickly dissolved to a look filled with need. Iruka lowered his hand and gently caressed Genma's entry, prodding it with a finger to coax the muscles to relax before pushing a digit in.</p><p>Genma's eyebrow furrowed at the entry, the invasion not at all pleasing to him at the moment. Iruka worked his second finger and noted the twitch on Genma's lip that pulled back to reveal him gritting his teeth. The third digit made Genma shut his eyes and silence the cry that wanted to tear out of his throat. Iruka kissed the knee over his shoulder, reaching with his other hand to caress Genma's slightly softened arousal from the pain induced entry of his fingers. He caressed the base of Genma's manhood, working up the blood to flow once more till what he held was a full aroused organ once more.</p><p>Genma had forgotten about Iruka's still fingers in his entrance while Iruka continued to pump him alive again until he moved the said fingers. Genma had to force himself to relax and breathe properly. Iruka wiggled his fingers, twisting around the warmth of Genma's body and making sure that muscles have adjusted slightly to the invasion. Genma whined at the movement, at the feeling of curved fingers stretching him</p><p>Iruka had to withdraw his fingers off one by one, forcing him to leave Genma's arousal for a while so as to soften the withdrawal and not make it irritable for the Jounin. Genma was torn between feeling good and feeling bad. He was relieved when Iruka removed his fingers. He caught his breath just as Iruka arranged himself and he could feel Iruka's arousal touching his entrance.</p><p>&quot;Trust me.&quot; Iruka said, adjusting his grip on Genma's other knee as he pushed the head of his arousal with his vacant hand in to Genma's entry. Genma cried out at the forced parting of his muscles, at the feeling of Iruka's hot arousal pulling him open. He felt vulnerable when Iruka left his back side and held his parted legs in place and pushed in slowly.</p><p>Genma couldn't stop the scream then. The gradual opening of his tensed muscles hurt. When Iruka stopped pushing, Genma forgot the pain. He felt something inside him being touched that sent shivers all the way up his spine that left his eyes half lidded.</p><p>Iruka watched the sudden change in reaction and kept in mind how he was positioned so he could trigger that reaction again later. He knew how painful back penetration could be the first time. His wasn't very easy either. He didn't have words to comfort Genma because he knew that Genma understood how painful it could be at first. He kissed the Jounin's knee once more to comfort him, reaching out and fingering the head of his arousal to wake Genma from his haze.</p><p>&quot;Iruka. More.&quot;</p><p>Iruka slowly pulled out and pushed in again, keeping himself in the same position he was in previously and watched Genma writhed under him, bucking and throwing his head back in pleasure.</p><p>&quot;Faster. Faster Iruka.&quot; Genma whispered, voice hoarse and thick with desire.</p><p>Iruka obliged and started pumping his way in slowly at first so that he wouldn't tear any of Genma's muscles. He increased his pace gradually until Genma was groan with every exhale. Iruka kept staring at Genma's face as he moved rhythmically in and out. Genma groans came faster and when Iruka felt Genma tighten around him, he gritted his teeth and bent down quickly to seal Genma's parted lips in a kiss.</p><p>Both broke apart from each other, the hard release making them pant for air. Genma had clawed in to Iruka's back, leaving large red nail marks from the mixed feelings of the searing kiss and the orgasm. Iruka remained in his upright position, his hands by Genma's head supporting him up.</p><p>He noted Genma's rosy lips, how his hair lay scattered over the pillow and how he had his neck thrown to one side. He watched as Genma writhed under him slightly, turning his head that felt as heavy as lead from the orgasm and looking at him with a blissful expression, a sheen of sweat covering his face and body. He pulled Iruka to his lips, kissing him. Iruka kissed back, nibbling on Genma's lips, as Genma ran his hands all over Iruka's back, reaching up and tangling his fingers in to Iruka's hair.</p><p>&quot;Iruka.&quot; Genma breathed out.</p><p>Iruka reached out and pushed the hair out of the Jounin's face, slightly moving his hips to pull out of him. &quot;I'll wake you in a few hours for your night duty.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stay a while.&quot; Genma said, closing his eyes.</p><p>&quot;I'm right here.&quot; Iruka lay next to Genma gathering him in his arms and tucking his head under his chin.</p><p>Genma let out a slow breath, pushing his face deeper in to Iruka's neck. Iruka remained still as Genma wrapped his arms around Iruka's back and fell in to a quiet sleep. Iruka looked out the window, waiting for sleep to claim him. He remained wide awake however, till it was time to wake Genma for his night duty shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>XXX</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truth be told, Genma didn't want to leave the apartment. He didn&rsquo;t want to get out of bed, he didn't want to leave the pillow and he didn't want to be away from Iruka's presence. Iruka had to resort to pulling him out of bed and pushing him in to the bathroom to take a shower and get dressed. Genma's reasoning that since Iruka was the one who dirtied him, Iruka should be the one to clean him didn't work. Iruka merely rolled his eyes and shut the bathroom door.</p><p>Genma's eyes twinkled in reminder of the hot sex that took place a few hours ago. He slept like a baby right after that intense orgasm. He was also wondering what Iruka packed in the small dinner box he handed him before he left the apartment.</p><p>&quot;So why are you seeing stars?&quot; Raidou asked, amused.</p><p>&quot;Because it's night time.&quot; Genma sighed, staring blankly ahead, a small smile on his lips.</p><p>Raidou rolled his eyes. &quot;No, not those stars, fool.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Genma shrugged and stretched his arms. &quot;Nothing. You know, the usual.&quot;</p><p>Raidou reached out and pulled the collar of Genma's shirt down to reveal a large love mark glowing bright red and purple. &quot;Yup. Seems like it. Finally.&quot; Genma pulled his collar back up and blushed. &quot;I'm happy for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; Genma turned and smiled at his best friend.</p><p>&quot;I give you my blessings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'll make you my best man.&quot; Genma grinned widely.</p><p>&quot;Marriage already?&quot; Raidou laughed, wrapping an arm around Genma's shoulder and tousling his hair. &quot;I'm very glad to see you like this. You're happy.&quot;</p><p>Genma looked at Raidou sincerely and nodded. &quot;I feel happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's a good thing. Not a bad thing. Remember that.&quot; Raidou waved a finger in front of Genma's face, which he swatted away.</p><p>&quot;Let's see what Iruka packed! I'm hungry.&quot;</p></div></div>"

"" class=""ljcut""><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10""><u><strong>HOPE - Part 12</strong></u><br /><br />Kakashi looked up and found Iruka blushing. &quot;I'm sorry but I don't think I'm prepared for anything fast or -&quot; Iruka swallowed. &quot;Rough. I start to remember things.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi smiled with understanding in his eyes. He stood up and took Iruka's hand in his, guiding him to the bedroom. &quot;We'll take it slow.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka's mind reeled with what was going on in Kakashi's head. Kakashi left him on the bed before disappearing out in the hallway. Iruka trembled from the kiss, but not from fear but from excitement. He felt tingly and light all over and the kiss was burning within his lips. He brought a hand to his lips, remembering the warm sensation that filled him, followed by a roaring fire that was so intense and so warm that Iruka found himself lost and melting into Kakashi's kiss.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">The door opened and Kakashi flicked on the lamp, turning the lights off and sat in front of Iruka on the bed, a plate in hand. Iruka looked at the plate and found several ripe red strawberries on them. He forgot that Kakashi was suddenly in front of him and reached out for the fruit. He picked up one from the leaves and sank his teeth in to the fruit and pleasured sigh escaping his lips as he began to suck and nibble at the fruit he was chewing in his mouth. He then licked his lips and bit in to the fruit again until on the leaves were left behind. He then licked his fingers before hungrily reaching for another one.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi watched with growing want and arousal as Iruka ate the fruit. He intended to feed it to him himself but watching him was better. Kakashi thought that strawberries were like Iruka. If you take care of them just right, they turn out sweet and delicious. If you are a bit reckless and did not devote enough time to it, it turned out either sour or real bad.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka was reaching for the last one but Kakashi took it in his hand and sank his own teeth in to the fruit. Iruka seethed and hissed then pouted. Kakashi chuckled and set the plate on the side table and kicking his sandals off. He lay on his back, still chewing on his strawberry and pulled Iruka down towards him, a hand on the back of his neck.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;I think I know why you love them so much. They're delicious.&quot; He said in between chews then finally swallowed the fruit he was eating. Iruka stared down at him, not used to being the one in control. &quot;Go on, Iruka. Do what you want to do with me.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka stared at him as if he had grown a second head. &quot;Do what I want?&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;Whatever you want.&quot; Kakashi said and flashed him a handsome smile. &quot;I am all yours.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka stared at Kakashi's lips, which were parted as he took in breaths. He then dipped his head down and placed a kiss on Kakashi's lips, brushing his hair away from his face as he placed his other hand at the curve of Kakashi's jaw. Kakashi kissed him back with equal passion. Iruka kissed him for several minutes, never getting tired with Kakashi's lips. His tongue traced the deep caverns of Kakashi's mouth and he found that he was missing a tooth on the right hand side of his cavity. It became is favorite spot and he would always run his tongue over it. Kakashi noticed and a chuckled in to the kiss. Iruka then slowed his kiss and pulled back, both of them breathing to each other.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;Kakashi.&quot; He whispered, eyes heavy lidded as he stared down that silver haired man. He then pulled Kakashi up from his lying position. He then placed a kiss on Kakashi's scarred eye and then slowly began to undo Kakashi's shirt and slide them gently off his shoulders. Kakashi liked having all of Iruka's attention on him and allowed the man to cast his shirt aside, his torso now exposed. Iruka then took his hands and placed them on the collar of his own button down shirt.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi understood the message and slowly began to undo the buttons, gently peeling away the shirt. Iruka was slender and lean and Kakashi was actually eager to kiss his entire body. It surprised him when Iruka moved close and enveloped him in a hug before pulling him down so that he was on top of the slightly smaller man. Iruka's hair was free from its ponytail and the long locks were sprayed all over the pillow. Kakashi found himself mesmerized by the sight, and the heavy lidded eyes and flushed cheeks only aroused him even more.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;You're beautiful.&quot; He whispered, and Iruka flushed.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi kissed him, nibbling at his lips and then exploring his caverns once again. Iruka tasted better than the strawberries and he found himself wanting more. He left Iruka's lips and began to trail open kisses to his ear, nibbling at the lobe and licking it. Iruka gave out a pleasured groan and Kakashi decided that he liked Iruka groaning from pleasure. He trailed his lips lower, to Iruka's pulse and found it beating erratically against his kiss-swollen lips. He licked the hollow of Iruka's neck, the little licks soon becoming gentle bites and kisses and this caused Iruka to wrap his arms around Kakashi and hold him closer.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;I've dreamed about this.&quot; Iruka whispered in between breaths.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;Did you?&quot; Kakashi asked, interested. He left several red marks down Iruka's neck and then began to kiss his chest. &quot;When?&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;After -&quot; Iruka suddenly buckled under Kakashi who had wrapped his lips around one of his nipple. He let out a whimpering pleasured sound and began to suck in more breaths. &quot;After - you - left.&quot; A gasp escaped Iruka's lips when Kakashi gently bit in to the bud and then licked. Iruka's arms came around Kakashi's neck, his fingers running through the silver hair in uncoordinated patterns. He shifted his attention to his other nipple, teasing it with his tongue and making Iruka squirm under him and pull at his hair.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;I like it when you squirm under me.&quot; Kakashi whispered to Iruka's chest. He then took the bud wholly in to his mouth and nipped and sucked at it, making Iruka whimper and buckle. Kakashi suddenly stopped and pulled back, making Iruka whimper and give a pained expression on his face. Kakashi got rid of the pants both of them were wearing in one fluid movement that Iruka did not even know what hit him. Then there was a pleasured feeling of their erections rubbing against each other. Iruka groaned loudly and Kakashi hissed as they kissed and slid up against one and other repeatedly. Then Kakashi stopped again and got up to fetch the lotion on the dresser. He then straddled Iruka's thighs and popped the lid open.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;W-What -?&quot; Iruka asked, looking up and breathing hard. He found Kakashi coating his fingers with the lotion and then set the bottle aside.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;I promised not to hurt you, remember?&quot; He said and gently touched Iruka's entrance with his cool slick fingers. Iruka suddenly tensed, an image of the monster that abused him months ago assaulting his memories. When nothing happened for several seconds, he opened his eyes and found Kakashi looking at him. He wanted this and he trusted Kakashi. &quot;I won't do it if you don't want me too.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka shook his head and gave him an encouraging smile. &quot;I want this.&quot; He said, and swallowed. &quot;I need this.&quot; Kakashi felt his manhood twitch at the lust coated voice that came out of Iruka's kiss-swollen lips. &quot;I trust you.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi turned his eyes to the erection of Iruka. He traced a finger up Iruka's erection making him squirm in reaction to his touch. He liked Iruka's expression so he swooped down and began to run his tongue up and down Iruka's length. The man tossed his head back, exposing his long neck to the moonlight. While Kakashi busied his lips with Iruka's length the gently probed his entrance with his coated finger. Iruka was blinded by the pleasure of Kakashi's mouth and the intrusion at his entrance. Kakashi took Iruka in wholly and at the same time inserted a second finger, making scissoring-movements to stretch the muscles. He could feel the little pearly drops escaping Iruka's organ, the bittersweet cream that tasted of only Iruka. He sucked harder, wanting more of Iruka's precious pearl drops and as he did so, he inserted a third finger, stretching him a good deal.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;Kakashi!&quot; He cried out.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi found himself licking Iruka clean like a cat. Iruka lay spent on the bed, hands on either side of him and breathing heavily in and out. Kakashi gently pulled his fingers out and Iruka did not even notice. His eyes were closed and cheeks strained red, a sheen of sweat covering his lean body. Kakashi felt hot himself and struggled to be patient. He watched Iruka catch his breath, which slowly began to even out. Kakashi slid up Iruka, trailing kisses around his waist then up his chest then finally on his lips. Iruka kissed him, instant energy surging in his body and he wrapped his arms around Kakashi's neck and back.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;I love you, Iruka.&quot; Kakashi whispered and kissed his forehead lightly.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka swallowed and sucked in a shaky breath. &quot;I - I love you Kakashi.&quot; He said and placed his hands on Kakashi's shoulders. Kakashi positioned himself to enter Iruka and slowly began to push through his tight entrance. Iruka bit his lower lip, shutting his eyes in pain. Kakashi gasped as the tightness drove him made with pleasure that he began to see white sparks behind his closed eyelids. He let out a moan as he brushed the end of Iruka's entrance. Iruka's eyes flew open and a silent shout escape his parted lips, his head thrown back in pleasure. Kakashi stared at the beautiful reaction he got from the man below him and noticed that Iruka was suddenly hard again. &quot;Kakashi! Kakashi!&quot; He said incoherently, throwing his head to one side. &quot;Oh Kakashi.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi felt orgasm coming close with just the sound of Iruka's voice calling his name. &quot;Iruka.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka turned his eyes slowly to Kakashi and then smiled at him. &quot;Love me.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi brushed a lock of hair away from Iruka's face and slowly shifted his position so he can move easier. He slid out slowly and then entered just as slow. He brushed that point which made Iruka buck under him and grab the sheets hard, a cry escaping his lips. &quot;More.&quot; He whispered and Kakashi obeyed. He slid out and then in again. He repeated it several times, making sure he hit that spot within Iruka until he rode a steady rhythm. Iruka gasped and cried out his name, tossing his head from side to side as his hands fisted in to the sheets. Kakashi allowed himself to be carried by the feeling of Iruka wrapped around him completely before his world was nothing but pure white light.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Iruka gave out a cry of pleasure as Kakashi emptied himself deep in Iruka's body. Kakashi felt himself drain of all his energy and slowly turned his head to his lover lying under him, sated and pleasured. Kakashi gently pulled himself out of Iruka, licked him clean then lowered himself to the bed, lying on his back and staring at the ceiling. Iruka's breaths finally evened out and soon he had fallen asleep. Kakashi pulled the covers over the both of them, and pulled Iruka close to his chest. He then closed his eyes and allowed sleep to carry him off to another place.<br /><br />*<br />Iruka woke up to find Kakashi staring down at him lovingly. Last night had been intense as well as loving. Kakashi had been patient, gentle and caring to him the entire time. Last night was the best example.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">He smiled up at him lazily, feeling every nerve in his body sing of pleasure. Kakashi placed a kiss on the tip of his nose. Sunlight poured through the tinted window and the birds outside sang their morning greetings. Kakashi did not want to get up. He lay back down and pulled Iruka on top of him, liking the tickling sensations that he got from the way Iruka's long soft hair teased his cheek and neck.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;I don't want to get up.&quot; Kakashi said, and closed his eyes.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">&quot;Who said I wanted to?&quot; Iruka responded and kissed Kakashi's lips slowly.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">They remained in each other's arms. Iruka could not think of anything better than their current state. He never felt so safe and so relieved not mention so pleasured before. Whatever demons that haunted him vanished in the abyss of darkness somewhere in the back of his mind. For now, his light was with him to keep him warm and safe. He no longer felt the icy-needle cold of loneliness. He just felt happy.</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">Kakashi himself thought that Icha Icha Paradise is a looser compared to the paradise he had lying in his arms.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c11""><p class=""c10"">FIN</p></div></div>"

It was just reflex, but Naruto's hand quickly came up to Kakashi's hair and pulled the nin's hair hard, jerking his face off his shoulders and bringing it to his line of vision.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi was smirking, lips red with the young ninja's blood. Naruto frowned as Kakashi wiped it away with the back of his hands. He placed his finger on Naruto's lips, outlining it slowly, studying every curve and mark on the now plump and pink flesh, bruised from their heated kisses. Naruto closed his eyes slowly and parted his lips, slipping his tongue out and giving Kakashi's finger a little lick. Kakashi felt his breath catch in his throat as he watched Naruto grow bolder with each growing second and was soon engaged in a heated vision of watching Naruto suck at his finger. Naruto dragged his lips in slow lazy movements along his finger before taking it into his mouth completely, nearly making Kakashi ejaculate.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Mmm!&quot; Naruto mewed, looking up at Kakashi and seeing his flushed and perspiring temples. Naruto abandoned the finger slowly, hoisting his weight onto his elbows and giving Kakashi's lower lip a long and lazy lick. &quot;Like that?&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi answered him by pressing their lips together and kissing Naruto deeply, tongue swirling in Naruto's caverns until the need for air pulled them apart. A few short intakes of breaths and Kakashi discarded his own pants and pressed his body against Naruto's naked flesh. Their bodies were already moist with sweat and Naruto tilted his head back as their manhoods rubbed against each other.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Someone might see us.&quot; Naruto hissed, reminding Kakashi that they were not in the safe confines of their own homes.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi gave a little unconcerned click of his tongue and shook his head. &quot;No one's here. Besides, wouldn't it be nice?&quot; He brought his lips to Naruto's ears and gave it a gentle lick, making Naruto shiver. &quot;To have a little audience?&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Kinky, aren't we?&quot; Naruto gasped out as Kakashi began to suck at his neck.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Touche.&quot; Kakashi whispered and brushed the locks of gold off Naruto's sweaty face. He began to playfully kiss him once more, his other hand snaking down Naruto's chest, down his stomach, glazing little feather touches over his thighs. Skilled fingers gently began to stroke Naruto's testicles, making him buck under Kakashi, and shutting his eyes in sheer pleasure, lips shut tight with pearly whites in an effort to prevent any noise escaping his throat.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi dragged his hands expertly up Naruto's length and gave the tip little teasing brushes with his thumb. A moan escaped Naruto's lips, sounding both pleasured and annoyed that the touch was light and teasing. Kakashi chuckled and gently ran his tongue down Naruto's neck, taking a nipple in his mouth and rolling and nipping at the bud while his hand busied itself with rubbing Naruto's length. Naruto was no longer thinking. He was torn between the teasing sensation on his chest and the mind blowing feeling Kakashi's hand was giving him. He let out a long loud groan when Kakashi run the nail of his thumb down his length several times. Kakashi coyly made his way up to Naruto's face, his hand no longer stroking Naruto's over-excited Bob. He looked down at Naruto, who had his head thrown to one side, panting, flushed and lips parted. Blue eyes looked up at him with need, want, lust and love - all combined. A groan of protest escaped Naruto's parted lips.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi gave Naruto's manhood a tight squeeze, making Naruto gasp out loud which Kakashi immediately silenced by kissing him, swallowing Naruto groan of pleasure. He kissed the blonde ninja with renewed fervor while Naruto continued to groan and pant as Kakashi increased the pace of his squeezing and rubbing, altering the positions and occasionally brushing the tip with his thumb. Naruto trembled and tried to toss his head from side to side, but Kakashi's other hand kept a firm hold on his hair as his kissed him senseless, pausing for a few seconds to catch his breath and then it was over. Naruto gave out a strangled and loud pleasured cry into Kakashi's kiss, as white-hot seed spilled all over Kakashi hand and waist.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Naruto breathed raggedly, his head thrown to one side, eyes shut after a rather intense orgasm. Kakashi kissed the top of his nose and gently brought a finger to his lips, licking off the white liquid that was just pure Naruto. He gave a pleasured sound before reaching down to Naruto's entrance and gently coating it with the white seed from his hands. Naruto was still caught in the after effects of his orgasm to notice. Kakashi spread a good amount at his entrance before taking some and sliding it over Kakashi Junior. He reached for Naruto's entrance and began to massage the tight skin with his fingers, before gently slipping a finger in.</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;AH!&quot; Naruto gasped, bucking against the intrusion. He stared at Kakashi wildly as another came, then another, until Kakashi had three of his fingers inside Naruto, wiggling and stretching. Naruto was caught between being surprised and being hurt at this penetration. Kakashi gave his lover lip a lick and a few nibbles.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi shifted to a better position and readied himself. He stared in to Naruto's eyes, before easing himself inside him. White flashes appeared in front of Naruto's eyes as he shut them tight and bit his lower lip to stop the scream of pain from coming out. Kakashi was so big and thick that Naruto wondered how he even managed to take all of him in. Then it was over and he could feel Kakashi's testicles on the cheeks of his buttocks. Tears hand involuntarily made their way to his eyes. He knew it would be painful, but not THIS painful. Kakashi was watching him, and gently wiped the tears away, before shifting a bit and hitting something inside Naruto that made the blonde gasp in pleasure and his eyed widen. Almost immediately, Naruto's sated sex erected and began to secrete more of his private flavor. Kakashi stooped down and began to lick away the pearly drops, while he willed himself to be patient as Naruto's muscles grew accustomed to his length.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Kakashi! Kakashi!&quot; Naruto gasped out, as Kakashi licked and sucked at his manhood Bob. &quot;Oh damn, Kakashi!&quot; He groaned and bucked under the copy-nin.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi stopped his licks and made sure that Naruto was clean before looking in to his eyes. &quot;Trust me.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Naruto stared at him and smiled. &quot;You know I do.&quot; He brought Kakashi's face close to him and kissed his lips ever so gently that it was very sweet. &quot;Love me.&quot; He whispered.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi gently eased himself out of Naruto halfway and pushed himself in again. Naruto gasped and groaned as his nerves burned with pleasure. Kakashi repeated the movement several times until he picked up a steady rhythm, the tightness of Naruto's being heating him up and sending wave after wave of pleasure washing over his mind and body. Naruto had wrapped his legs around Kakashi's waist sometime during his thrusts but he was so preoccupied he didn't notice. He was lost in Naruto's being, deep in his heat and body as he rocked forward faster and harder. Naruto's fingers gripped his shoulders tight and, almost simultaneously, they came.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Kakashi!&quot; Naruto gasped out, an intense orgasm overcoming him again, not once but twice in a row.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Kakashi shut his eyes and threw his head back as he drove in one final thrust, and gasped out Naruto's name, emptying himself inside Naruto's body. Kakashi almost collapsed painfully on Naruto, but managed to support his weight on a trembling arm, staring down at Naruto.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;I love you.&quot; Kakashi whispered, kissing him slowly. &quot;So so much.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">Naruto smiled and closed his eyes, wrapping arms around Kakashi. &quot;Me too.&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">It sounded cheesy but Kakashi was happier than he ever felt in his life since the loss of his precious ones. He watched with silent pleasure as Naruto closed his eyes and fell asleep after the mind-blowing sex, lips giving a pleasured sigh before finally surrendering himself completely to Kakashi's care. Kakashi eased himself out of Naruto very, very slowly and gently watched him sleep. He lay beside him, wrapping his arms around the smaller shinobi securely and keeping him warm.&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">&quot;Boy, I'm really lucky.&quot; He smiled up at the moon. &quot;Ne, Obito? Sensei?&quot;&nbsp;</p></div><div class=""c13""><p class=""c12"">And the stars blinked back.</p></div></div>"

"" class=""ljcut""><p>Genma pulled back from his kiss and stared down at Iruka, letting his finger trace the lines of Iruka&rsquo;s face. He took in the blush; the heavy lidded eyes, the kiss-bruised lips and found himself getting <i>very</i> excited. Iruka whimpered when he brushed his fingers around the bobbing Adam&rsquo;s apple due to the heavy breaths Iruka was currently heaving. Genma found himself smiling at the scene below him, not able to resist the urge to dip his head down and gently sink his teeth on to the bobbing Adam&rsquo;s apple. Iruka&rsquo;s breath hitched, arms circling Genma&rsquo;s torso, as his fingers dug in to his back, leaving little half moon marks on to the caramel skin.</p><p>&quot;That hurts.&quot; Genma mumbled, as he continued to kiss and nip at Iruka&rsquo;s throat.</p><p>&quot;Hnnn!&quot; Iruka managed to choke out, lips parting in a silent gasp as Genma moved to one side, just above Iruka&rsquo;s collarbone and began to leave a rather large love bite. &quot;G-Genma!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes?&quot; There was a string on incoherent groans and words that Genma stopped and sat up, looking down at Iruka. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p>Iruka was breathing heavily, head to one side, hair spilled all over the light blue pillow, lips parted. Genma had to literally claw at his patience, which he was glad to have after years of training. But Iruka all open and vulnerable below him &ndash; Genma could feel his brain go in to over drive. Iruka swallowed and turned to look up at him, and for a moment he just looked. He reached up with a hand and gently touched Genma&rsquo;s shoulder, closing his eyes and just <i>feeling</i> him. Genma watched as the sexiest display was performed right below him. He allowed Iruka to touch him in however way he wanted to. Iruka&rsquo;s hands slid to his waist, feeling the curve of flesh and bones, down to his thighs, memorizing the hard and folded muscles of his legs due to the straddling position he was in. Iruka&rsquo;s lips would part or close as his hands moved, like he was sculpting a clay pot. Those hands ever so slowly slid up once more, roaming over the well-toned slim abs then to his chest, over two hard buds then to his shoulders.</p><p>&quot;Shoulders.&quot; Iruka whispered, a smile gracing his lips, but he kept his eyes closed. &quot;You have such strong shoulders.&quot;</p><p>Genma found his breath taken away as Iruka&rsquo;s hands crawled up to his neck, fingers tracing his jaw line, then his cheeks and forehead. Genma closed his eyes and allowed himself to get lost to the feeling of Iruka touching him. Iruka&rsquo;s thumb danced over his lips, fingers giving lighter and lighter touches until they felt like mere wind blowing over his face. Genma reached out and took the warm hands in his, holding them to his cheek, before kissing the palm several times. Iruka kept his eyes closed, but his lips were smiling. Slowly, he pulled Genma&rsquo;s hands down, abandoning one and taking the other in both his open palms. He brought to his lips, eyes still closed and kissed each digit. Genma suddenly remembered to breathe, but it hitched in his throat, when Iruka took his thumb in to his mouth and began to suck on it, all while, his eyes fluttered open, the half lidded look now staring right at him.</p><p>&quot;Tease,&quot; Genma whispered while Iruka merely smiled and pulled his lips away from the finger, using his own hand to guide the finger down to his chest, sliding down his chin and neck. &quot;You raunchy tease!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You like it.&quot; Iruka whispered, and settled Genma&rsquo;s hand over his navel. &quot;Admit it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I love it.&quot; Genma said, grinning, before dipping low, lips hovering hotly over Iruka&rsquo;s. &quot;I love you.&quot;</p><p>Iruka parted his lips for a kiss and Genma took the invitation with no question. Iruka wrapped his arms around Genma&rsquo;s neck, running his fingers through the soft locks of honey, tugging and gripping as their tongues did a battle. Genma pulled back, both of them gasping loud and panting hard.</p><p>&quot;Genma.&quot; Iruka groaned, and shifted, tugging at Genma&rsquo;s pants.</p><p>&quot;Impatient.&quot; Genma chuckled and stood up to get rid of the pajama bottom he was wearing. Iruka sat up from the bed and stared at Genma&rsquo;s manhood, all alert and ready to fire. &quot;Well? Is it like your dream?&quot;</p><p>Iruka had the sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu wash over him. He stared at Genma&rsquo;s manhood for a while and began a mini debate in his head. <i>So is it bigger? Or smaller? Or is it the same? How the hell am I going to take in all that?</i> &quot;Uh &ndash; I can&rsquo;t tell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Genma asked, placing his hands on his hips.</p><p>&quot;Because, I&rsquo;m looking at it and thinking, how?&quot; Iruka blinked, and swallowed, suddenly nervous.</p><p>&quot;Well, you&rsquo;re made of muscle. So you obviously stretch.&quot; Genma said, noting how Iruka was now blushing very hotly. &quot;We don&rsquo;t have to do this if you &ndash;&quot; Iruka got on his knees and pulled Genma to the bed, making him sit while crawled over his lap, placing a very shy kiss on &lsquo;Sharpie&rsquo;. Genma was stunned and stuttering. &quot;T-That too c-can be an o-option.&quot;</p><p>Iruka looked up at him and blushed. &quot;May I?&quot;</p><p>Genma shrugged, eyes wide. &quot;Y-You can do whatever you want with me, love. I&rsquo;m not going to complain at &ndash; AH!&quot; Iruka gently bit the tip, raking his teeth over the hard flesh before beginning the gentle motions of licking and sucking. &quot;Oh god!&quot; Genma gasped, tilting his head back and blinking wide eyes, as Iruka&rsquo;s hair caressed his thighs, fingers massaged his length and lips and tongue just roam all over him.</p><p>&quot;Hnnn &ndash; I like this.&quot; Iruka said, humming a soft tune at the back of throat.</p><p>&quot;Like what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I like <i>this. Doing this to you</i>.&quot; Iruka whispered, and continued sucking. Genma tangled his fingers in to Iruka&rsquo;s hair, as the man below him as he began to feel the contractions of orgasm coming up. &quot;You like that?&quot; Iruka nipped at one side, while he let his nails trail up and down the rather impressive length.</p><p>&quot;Yes! Oh hell yes!&quot; Genma moaned and bit his lower lip to prevent himself from shouting as he ejaculated. Iruka coughed a bit, before he felt that tongue move again. &quot;Hnn! Iruka!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Iruka looked up, licking the side of his lip, the white sticky substance that coated it vanishing under the swipe of his pink tongue.</p><p>&quot;You are one hell of a tease!&quot; Genma breathed out and pulled Iruka on top of him, allowing Iruka to settle just above his semi erect manhood. Even after one hell of an orgasm, just seeing Iruka being himself was enough to turn him on again. Iruka shifted a bit, his bottom rubbing against the slightly drooped down flesh. Genma&rsquo;s eyes widened at the thighs grinding against his hips and almost immediately, he was hard again. &quot;Yes. Definitely a tease.&quot;</p><p>He pinned Iruka below him, and kissed him senseless all the while his finger prodded at the entrance, gently parting the folded tight flesh. Iruka moaned at the intrusion of fingers, not know what was going to happen. Genma kept kissing him, slowing and increasing the pace of his lips against Iruka&rsquo;s as he concentrated on making him comfortable.</p><p>A sharp cry escaped Iruka&rsquo;s lips, his mind registering the fact that he was feeling quite <i>full</i> and stared in to Genma&rsquo;s eyes with horror and a pain stricken face. &quot;What &ndash; how &ndash; what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three.&quot; Genma whispered, flicking his tongue out at the earlobe. &quot;You have three of my fingers inside you right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-Three?&quot; Iruka blinked and stared at the hand that Genma used to support his weight beside his head. Genma had long fingers and nicely boned ones as well. Three of them together were &ndash; &quot;H-How?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Y-You stretch, love. You stretch.&quot; Genma whispered and wriggled his fingers inside him, making Iruka gasp and groan out loud. Genma continued to wriggle his fingers, and found Iruka begging him for more. Feeling that he was stretched enough, Genma pulled out his fingers and used that hand to support his weight on the mattress. With his other hand he held two fingers in front of Iruka. &quot;Lick.&quot;</p><p>Iruka blinked, but took the fingers anyway and gave it long wet licks until they were thickly coated with his mouth enzymes. Genma reached down for Iruka&rsquo;s entrance, wetting the muscles thoroughly. He shifted his position and lifted Iruka&rsquo;s leg to his shoulder, all the while Iruka was staring at him with wide eyes.</p><p>&quot;Is &ndash; Is it really necessary to hold my leg up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&rsquo;ll be more comfortable.&quot; Genma answered. &quot;Ready?&quot;</p><p>Iruka swallowed and inhaled shakily. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>Genma watched Iruka&rsquo;s face, as he slowly eased in to him. Iruka&rsquo;s face scrunched up in pain, teeth flashing a bit as he bit down on his lower lip. His fists tightened around the bed sheets, as he threw his head to one side, groans of pain vibrating in his throat. Then he gasped, once Genma was fully inside him, and began to pant heavily, face tainted red, and eyes wide. Genma had to close his eyes for a while as the tight feeling surrounded him, hot and wet. He didn&rsquo;t know that he could feel this good. He remained still for a moment, until he felt a hand on his arm, and found Iruka looking up at him, a vision of erotic heaven, looking needy and beautiful.</p><p>&quot;Genma.&quot; He whispered. &quot;Move.&quot;</p><p>Genma blinked for a second before it registered in his mind. He slowly set his hips in to rhythm, finding a pace that was both comfortable for his spinal column and for Iruka&rsquo;s body. Iruka had thrown his head back, little small gasps escaping his lips as Genma moved back and forth. The familiar contractions was coming again, and Iruka was getting louder and louder, until he threw his head back, damp hair framing his flushed and sweaty face, cried out his name in ecstasy, warm sticky cream spilling over his stomach. Genma bit down his lower lip as orgasm washed over him, seconds later after Iruka&rsquo;s. He slowed his movements, and remained very still in his kneeling position, Iruka&rsquo;s leg still on his shoulder. Swallowing and regaining some coherency, he set Iruka&rsquo;s leg down and eased himself out, pearl drops coating his relaxing manhood, as he lied down beside Iruka, both feeling sticky and wet. The cooling effect of after sex washed over them, the heat and stickiness almost immediately forgotten.</p><p>&quot;Wow.&quot; Iruka whispered and closed his eyes. &quot;That was an experience.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah?&quot; Genma wrapped his arms tiredly around the slightly smaller frame beside him. &quot;Glad you enjoyed that love.&quot;</p><p>Iruka smiled at Genma being a romantic, he sucked in a shaky breath and began to relax, snuggling closer to Genma. &quot;Don&rsquo;t leave me. I don&rsquo;t want to be alone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I won&rsquo;t.&quot; Genma whispered, kissing his cheek tiredly. &quot;I won&rsquo;t.&quot; Genma fell asleep in minutes. Iruka snaked his arms over Genma&rsquo;s slim hips, and closed his own eyes.</p><p>&quot;I love you.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><p>In the office, Raido was holding his hand out to Anko, who was grudgingly counting bills and placing it on the open palm.</p><p>&quot;I told you! I told you! I told you my plan would work!&quot; Raido said, almost dancing on his toes in joy as more bills were piled in to his palm.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. All you did was tell me to go and make Genma think I like him so that Iruka would wake up! I did the work! Shouldn&rsquo;t you just get half of the bet?&quot; Anko reasoned, not wanting to shed more money.</p><p>&quot;Nope! You never believed it would work! Well, hah! You saw it yourself! Iruka entered Genma&rsquo;s apartment with him and <i>never</i> came out again!&quot; Raido clapped once in joy as he counted the bills he received.</p><p>&quot;What makes you think they&rsquo;re having sex?&quot; Anko asked.</p><p>&quot;Oh believe me! They will be.&quot; Raido began to laugh like a maniac. He glanced at everyone in the office, which included Aoba, Gai, Kurenai, Asuma and Shizune. &quot;You guys want to bet on it?&quot;</p><p>A loud chorus. &quot;NO!&quot;</p><p>Raido continued laughing.&nbsp;</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><p>Iruka woke up in the unholy hour (according to him) of nine in the morning. He found himself staring right at Genma&rsquo;s sleeping face, and he smiled, remembering the other night&rsquo;s escapades. Gently brushing the hair out of Genma&rsquo;s face, he got off the bed, covered Genma with the blankets and padded to the bathroom. He took a spare towel from the rack and turned on the hot shower. He washed away the dried semen on his thighs and stomach, soaping himself clean till he was feeling refreshed.</p><p>Turning the knob off, he grabbed the towel and dried himself, before wrapping it around his waist and padding back in to the room. His clothes were damp with sweat from their make out session the other night, and just remembering it made him blush. He shook his head and looked around. He hoped Genma didn&rsquo;t mind if he borrowed something for a while. He spotted a robe folded on the chair in the corner of the room and pulled it on. He wrapped the terry cloth robe around him tightly, not wanting to be exposed for the mean time. He run a comb through his hair took the towel to hang in the balcony to dry before padding to the kitchen.</p><p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s see.&quot; Iruka mumbled, and spotted the kettle. He began to boil some water, and as he waited for that to finish, he went about searching the cupboards for things to eat. He found some biscuits in one of the cupboards, along with a bottle of apricot jam and a sealed bottle of chocolate syrup. There was a can of tuna, which he ignored and a can of sweet corn, which he stared at for a moment before ignoring it completely. He opened the freezer and found some bacon still in its plastic package. He took one glance at the expiry date and tossed it in to the bin. He looked at the fridge and found a packet of frozen chicken nuggets, which he also threw away because it was already five months past its expiry date. The freezer was practically empty after he rummaged through it and the kitchen bin was already half full.</p><p>Sighing he looked at the bottom fridge door and found some eggs, a whole shelf with foil wrapped sandwiches, some pears that seemed fresh and crunchy, a new pack of toast, a packet of expired milk and a drawer full of rotting vegetables, it being cucumbers, tomatoes and a potato.</p><p>&quot;Silly man. You&rsquo;re not supposed to put potatoes in the fridge.&quot; He mumbled and threw everything away. He tied the black plastic of the trash bin and sent one of his clones to throw it out. He sent another clone to fetch some breakfast from the nearest supermarket. A good ten minutes later, he was flipping pancakes and stacking them on to a plate. He was turning the burner off when arms snaked around his middle, the hands playing the opening of the robe.</p><p>&quot;You look good in my clothes. Very sexy.&quot; Genma whispered, smelling soapy and clean from his shower.</p><p>&quot;Good morning.&quot; Iruka greeted, and turned around, promptly kissing Genma senseless. Genma crushed him to his chest, kissing with equal fervor, as his hands began to get a bit naughty and began to cup Iruka&rsquo;s taut bottom. &quot;Breakfast?&quot;</p><p>Genma nipped at Iruka&rsquo;s neck. &quot;What? You&rsquo;re not?&quot;</p><p>Iruka laughed. &quot;Come on.&quot; He lead him to the kitchen table and sat him on a chair, placing a mug of warm coffee beside him. &quot;I found some chocolate syrup in your cupboard.&quot; Iruka set a plate of pancakes before Genma who helped himself to some syrup.</p><p>&quot;Oh I love these.&quot; Genma said, and took a bite. &quot;Hmm! But I think you&rsquo;re tastier.&quot;</p><p>Iruka blushed at the comment and teasing, and went about eating his own breakfast. While Genma wolfed his down, he took his time. He was sipping his coffee, minutes later when he heard Genma&rsquo;s chair scrape the tiled floors, and him carry his plate and mug to the kitchen sink. It surprised Iruka a lot when Genma took <i>his</i> plate and <i>his</i> mug and set them on the kitchen counter, promptly clearing up the table. Even the chocolate syrup as gone.</p><p>&quot;Uh &ndash; do you have to be at work? I&rsquo;m sorry, I &ndash;&quot;</p><p>Iruka found himself pinned on the table, Genma above him, a jar of apricot jam in his hand. &quot;Shush, Iruka. I&rsquo;m not going to work today and neither are you.&quot;</p><p>Iruka was staring at the jam. &quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Raido will take care of things.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He knows you&rsquo;re here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In fact, he was the one who urged me to follow you. Last night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&rsquo;s a great friend.&quot; Genma smiled fondly. &quot;Annoying, but one of a kind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But anyway.&quot; Genma shrugged.</p><p>&quot;What about Anko? Last night, weren&rsquo;t you two supposed to &ndash;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Raido told me to forget it and just follow you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s see.&quot; Genma slowly unscrewed the lid of the jar and dipped his finger in. He was dressed in nothing by old Jounin pants, that had a hole on one cheek of his butt and it looks like he wasn&rsquo;t wearing any underwear either. He pulled his finger out, licking the sweet jam and smiled. &quot;I like jam. Especially apricots. Actually, I like raspberry better. But the store didn&rsquo;t have raspberry. Do you like jams?&quot;</p><p>Iruka was staring at him stupidly, as he licked his finger and scooped some more from the jar, only to lick it away again. &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Iruka nodded.</p><p>&quot;Good! Because, I&rsquo;m going to share my jam with you.&quot; Genma said, taking two finger full in to his mouth and smiling down at Iruka, almost childlike and cute. He leaned closer and kissed Iruka, and <i>shared</i> his jam with him. &quot;I can share some more if you want?&quot; Genma said, licking his lips.</p><p>&quot;Put that mouth of yours to better use than talking!&quot; Iruka growled.</p><p>&quot;Oh, authoritative, are we?&quot; Genma teased and got rid of the knot that held the robe closed and spread it open, running his eyes over Iruka&rsquo;s body, and smiled. &quot;You sound very sexy, Iruka-<i>kun</i>.&quot; Genma reached out for a spoon and scooped jam on to Iruka&rsquo;s stomach, spreading it all over, while Iruka yelped at the cool jelly-like substance. &quot;But as much as you turn me on, I don&rsquo;t take orders. Bad, bad Iruka! I should punish you.&quot; He chuckled and began to lick the jam off Iruka&rsquo;s stomach.</p><p>&quot;Genma!&quot; Iruka gasped, bucking under the skill full tongue that was licking him clean like a cat. &quot;I just took a shower!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t hear you complaining.&quot; Genma said in a singsong voice, and toed a chair over. He unzipped his pants and sat on the chair, gathering Iruka in his lap, while he pushed the robe off completely. &quot;You&rsquo;re so beautiful.&quot; Iruka blushed. &quot;I can&rsquo;t help but feel so incredibly lucky. You&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re sexy, you&rsquo;re hot and boy have you got one hell of a tongue!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Genma!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmmm! Just remembering you last night, hmmm!&quot; Genma closed his eyes as he spread some jam on Iruka&rsquo;s throat with his finger. &quot;You know what I mean, love?&quot;</p><p>Iruka blushed. Genma was such a romantic. &quot;Genma, it&rsquo;s broad daylight. We&rsquo;re in a town filled with nosy ninjas and the curtains aren&rsquo;t even closed!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what?&quot; Genma whispered, running his tongue up Iruka&rsquo;s throat till his chin. &quot;Let them see.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Genma!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, it&rsquo;s free porn.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What the &ndash; &quot;</p><p>&quot;But I love you! I do this, because I love you so, so, so much! I can&rsquo;t get enough of you.&quot; Genma whispered, now sucking at his Adam&rsquo;s apple, that he so loved for some reason. &quot;So, to me, it&rsquo;s not just sex. It&rsquo;s just you! Being with you.&quot; His voice dropped to a husky tone. &quot;Feeling you.&quot;</p><p>Iruka swallowed, and grabbed on to Genma&rsquo;s shoulders as Genma shifted to a more comfortably sitting position. &quot;Genma, I &ndash;&quot;</p><p>&quot;I love you. Don&rsquo;t forget that.&quot; Genma kissed him gently, softly. &quot;Don&rsquo;t ever forget that, okay?&quot;</p><p>Iruka smiled. &quot;I won&rsquo;t.&quot;</p><p>Genma grinned. &quot;Good. Kiss me.&quot;</p><p>Iruka obeyed, and pressed his lips down as Genma tilted his head back, allowing Iruka to ravage him good. &quot;Sweet.&quot; Iruka mumbled. &quot;Very sweet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The magic of apricot jams.&quot; Genma chuckled, and began to finger Iruka&rsquo;s entrance. Iruka shifted his legs, and slowly lowered himself over Genma, feeling the thick intrusion fill him, small whimpers escaping his lips, as Genma groaned his name out. &quot;Hnn! You feel so good!&quot;</p><p>Iruka found his stomach doing flips at Genma&rsquo;s words. His heart beats so fast that he wondered if it would explode. &quot;Big.&quot; He whimpered.</p><p>&quot;All the more better for you to ride on.&quot; Genma grinned, pulling Iruka in to a kiss. Iruka remained still as his grabbed the jar of apricot jam and placed some on his shoulder. Genma moved forward and began to lick at it, arms tightly around Iruka&rsquo;s waist while Iruka had his around his shoulders. As Genma began to lick the sweet treat off Iruka&rsquo;s shoulder, Iruka began to move, making short sliding movements that drove Genma over the edge, making him see stars and gasp in between licks. Iruka was holding on to Genma&rsquo;s shoulders like he was a lifeboat, afraid of falling at the same time afraid of loosing the fantastic sensation of feeling <i>Sharpie </i>in him.</p><p>&quot;Hnn! Genma!&quot; Iruka gasped, his erection rubbing against Genma&rsquo;s taut stomach, as he bucked and orgasm washed over him.</p><p>Genma grabbed his bottoms and continued moving for him, until he felt orgasm rake through his body, shouting out Iruka&rsquo;s name on his sticky shoulder. Both remained still until Genma began to lick his shoulder again, savoring the last sweet and salty taste of jam and sweat from Iruka&rsquo;s skin.</p><p>&quot;If my mornings are always going to be like this,&quot; Genma whispered pulling back to stare tiredly at Iruka. &quot;Then I must be the luckiest guy in the world.&quot;</p><p>Iruka merely laughed.</p><p>XXX</p><p>It took a month before Genma moved in with Iruka. The news spread like wildfire amongst the office staff, and everyone, especially Raido, was very happy for Genma and Iruka. It was practically glowing in Genma&rsquo;s face that he loved Iruka to bits whenever Iruka&rsquo;s name was mentioned. And vice versa for Iruka.</p><p>Raido couldn&rsquo;t forget the one time when a student called Rika gave Iruka a daisy during valentines day.</p><i><p>&quot;Iruka-sensei, here&rsquo;s flower for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you Rika.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Iruka-sensei doesn&rsquo;t get any flowers from Genma-sensei?&quot;</p></i><i><p>&quot;Oh, Genma-sensei does give flowers still. Not all the time though.&quot; Iruka laughed nervously.</p><p>&quot;You look happy, Iruka-sensei. Genma-sensei makes you happy, ne?</p><p>&quot;Well, that&rsquo;s something.&quot; Iruka laughed nervously again, not sure how to handle the child before him.</p><p>&quot;That&rsquo;s good! Iruka-sensei is not lonely anymore! And you look younger now!&quot; Rika giggled and waved good bye to Iruka as she ran out of the Academy gates to her waiting mother.</p><p>&quot;Hey, what do you mean younger! I&rsquo;m twenty-five!&quot; Iruka suddenly snapped, huffing.</p></i><p>Raido couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing after that day. Every time he remembered it, he would laugh so hard, that tears would trickle down his cheeks. Iruka still worried about Naruto and no matter how many times Genma told him, he still looked for him during his missions. Raido once told his friend that he had to respect Iruka&rsquo;s love for Naruto and Iruka was not the type to give up easily and in time, Genma did and at the most, he accompanied Iruka on his missions.</p><p>There were times when Iruka would cry and Genma would hold him. There were times when Iruka would feel sick and Genma would take care of him. But Genma never complained and continued to give Iruka his undying support and love. Raido would sometimes laugh at how the relationship started, all because of a pot of hot coffee. Now, watching Genma and Iruka walk down the street, side by side, after coming home from a mission, he couldn&rsquo;t help but smile as he walked down the opposite way to his own home.</p><p>And he chuckled during his walk, because for the first time in a long time, he was felt truly happy for Genma and Iruka. &quot;Looks like the cheesy saying is true after all. True love spawns from the silliest things.&quot;</p><p>In Iruka and Genma&rsquo;s case, it was the pitcher of coffee.</p><p>FIN</p></div></div></div>"

It was a rather cool night, with winter coming just around the corner. It didn&rsquo;t snow in Konoha, but the cold winds and rain were just as nasty. Although snow was beautiful, it was still troublesome to handle. Naruto inhaled deeply, sitting on the roof&rsquo;s railing and gazing at the mountain carvings. They were already working on Tsunade&rsquo;s, the shape of the face and hair already present. Last he heard, the statue would be completed in about four more months. Naruto felt himself smirking. His eyes drifted to the fourth&rsquo;s face, taking in its shape, his gaze lingering towards the eyes. Almond shaped eyes, like his. They were supposed to be blue, not the dull color of stone. His hair was supposed to be gold, like the sun, not the color of stone. <p>Naruto felt loneliness wash over him. In nights like these, when he let his thoughts wander, he wondered how his father sounded when he spoke, or when he laughed. He wondered how he would hold his cup when drinking his coffee or tea. He wondered how he ate his meal, or how his wrist flicked when using his chopsticks. He wondered what his shoe size could have been, or if he preferred eating oranges to grapes. He wondered if he slept on his side or on his back or maybe even on his stomach. Sometimes, he even wondered if his father was a prankster like himself when he was kid. Was he lazy? Was he always smiling? Did he like telling jokes?</p><p>Then the bitter truth would hit him.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know his father as the person that he was.</p><p>Naruto brought a hand to his face, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p><p>It was also on nights like these did he wish he could cry so freely.</p><p>&quot;A penny for your thoughts?&quot;</p><p>Naruto flicked his eyes to one corner, seeing Sasuke standing behind the railing. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a nice night. Went out for a walk.&quot; Sasuke said, hands in his pockets.</p><p>Naruto nodded his head. &quot;Haven&rsquo;t seen you around the mission room lately.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, well, I got discharged from the hospital a few days ago.&quot; Sasuke said, staring up at the sky. &quot;Got injured during a mission. Hunters brought the entire squad back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah?&quot; Naruto said, trying not to smirk.</p><p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Sasuke turned to look at Naruto. &quot;Naruto -&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have to go.&quot; Naruto said, turning his sitting position before hopping off the railing. &quot;It&rsquo;s dinner time.&quot; He dipped his head in a form of a polite parting and began to walk the other way when Sasuke&rsquo;s arm shot out, his hand landing on his chest, stopping him. Naruto quirked an eyebrow as Sasuke stared into his eyes.</p><p>&quot;Naruto, answer me honestly.&quot; Sasuke said, eyes losing its hard and cold edge for a brief moment. &quot;Do I mean anything to you?&quot;</p><p>Naruto looked at him for a long moment before bringing his hand up and pulling Sasuke&rsquo;s hand off his shirt gently, giving it a light squeeze before walking away.</p><p>Sasuke kept staring at his back, even as he hopped down towards the lower rooftops.</p><p>For now, that answer was enough.</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><p>Naruto gaped at the table. &quot;You made all this?&quot;</p><p>Haku smiled, pulling a chair and sitting himself. Gaara was already helping himself to some of the rice. Haku made some curry and vegetable salad. Naruto had never had such a spread on his table before and he only ate such food when he was staying over at Iruka&rsquo;s house and that had been a long time ago. But to find it on his table, which was normally empty, Naruto found the sight rather endearing and somewhat heart-warming. It wasn&rsquo;t only the food that did the trick, but the fact that Gaara was already tucking in to his plate, muttering compliments towards Haku, while Haku, in return merely laughed and turned to look at him.</p><p>&quot;Some rice, Naruto?&quot; Haku asked.</p><p>Naruto, for the first time in front of Gaara and Haku, grinned. Gaara had to stop in mid chew for a while to just stare. Haku continued smiling, glad that he emitted such a reaction from Naruto.</p><p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; Naruto said, pulling a chair and sitting. &quot;Yes, please! No, one more, just a little bit more, yes, that&rsquo;s it!&quot; Naruto said, taking his place from Haku who had been scooping rice on to it and setting it in front of him, the grin now a smile on his face, eyes twinkling like a child.</p><p>&quot;You&rsquo;re smiling again.&quot; Gaara said, eyes softening as Naruto swallowed his rice.</p><p>&quot;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&quot; Naruto said, then stared at his plate, eyes not leaving it as he continued to scoop some rice with his chopsticks. &quot;I found a home in the both of you.&quot; For a long moment, there was stunned silence, before Gaara gave a small smile, and Haku looked at his own plate, a blush on his cheeks, but his face looking serene and <i>happy.</i> &quot;Can I have more rice?&quot; Naruto asked, holding his plate out, mouth stuffed with food. &quot;This is delicious!&quot;</p><p>Haku began to laugh and took his plate, scooping more rice on to it, while Gaara, for the first time, began to chuckle.</p><p>XXX</p><p>A few days later, Haku&rsquo;s papers were ready and he was officially a Konoha citizen. He was given a job in the academy as a field instructor. To say that Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura were shocked was an understatement. They were busy ogling at the mere figure of Haku, who was now standing behind Naruto and Gaara in the mission room, looking at them with a smile.</p><p>&quot;You - You&rsquo;re here!&quot; Sakura exclaimed.</p><p>&quot;Good afternoon, Haruno-san.&quot; Haku said, still smiling.</p><p>&quot;When did you get here?&quot; Sasuke asked, a smirk on his face. Obviously pleased that Haku was doing well.</p><p>&quot;Just a few days ago, really.&quot; Haku said, rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;Hokage-sama was kind enough to allow me to work here, seeing that I am not a registered ninja of the mist.&quot; Sakura and Sasuke nodded in understanding. &quot;Naruto-kun was also nice enough to let me stay at his place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He what?&quot; Kakashi asked, blinking and shifted his gaze to Naruto, who was now looking at him with cold and unforgiving eyes. Kakashi found himself shivering at the sight and he remembered the eventful day when Naruto <i>nearly</i> choked him to death. &quot;Naruto, you&rsquo;re full of surprises. What else do you have up your sleeve?&quot; He said, sounding like a joke on the outside, but he meant it. Naruto did not give him an answer but only intensified his heated glare. &quot;So, Haku, are you going to take the chuunin exam? Or Jounin exam?&quot; Kakashi asked, shifting his gaze away from Naruto uncomfortably.</p><p>&quot;Neither, really. I&rsquo;ll be teaching at the academy, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of it, Haruno-san.&quot; Sakura gave a happy nod, smiling. &quot;No ninja work for me. I&rsquo;d rather teach.&quot;</p><p>There was silence for a moment and only then did Sasuke and Sakura realize something. Naruto was not supposed to <i>know</i> that Haku was dead. Sasuke turned his eyes towards Naruto, staring at him for a long while. &quot;Naruto, how did -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thanks for not telling me.&quot; Naruto said, and turned to look at Kakashi. His teeth ground together, before Gaara&rsquo;s hand came to his shoulder. &quot;I&rsquo;m going for a walk. Cover for me, will you?&quot; He said, looking at Gaara, who just nodded.</p><p>Naruto left, without saying another word to the people behind him and headed for the waterfalls towards the outskirts of the village.&nbsp;</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><p>Kakashi&rsquo;s mind was a whirl. Gaara was not pointedly looking at him, before green eyes moved towards Sasuke&rsquo;s figure, then back towards his.</p><p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t you have something to do, Hatake-san?&quot; Haku said, turning to look at Kakashi. &quot;Don&rsquo;t want to be late again, do we?&quot; Sasuke and Sakura turned to look at Haku with raised eyebrows. &quot;Ah, Naruto-kun always whined about the fact that Hatake-san was always a late person when he was younger. I sincerely hope that the habit has gone. Waiting does get tiresome, don&rsquo;t you think?&quot; He smiled at Sakura and Sasuke.</p><p>&quot;Yes, in fact, there were times when we simply wanted to just leave our team&rsquo;s meeting point.&quot; Sakura said, rubbing her chin in thought.</p><p>Kakashi did not care to what Haku was saying. There was just <i>one</i> thing going through his mind at the moment.</p><i><p>Naruto remembered the old days!</p></i><p>&quot;Well, I have things to do and places to go.&quot; Kakashi said, offering a wave before leaving the room.</p><p>Once outside, he began to look for Naruto.</p><p>He never would have thought that the day would come when he would curse the village for being <i>huge</i>! It took him a good two hours of searching, simply because Naruto didn&rsquo;t leave a trail behind him, which was another thing that puzzled him. Naruto&rsquo;s chakra tracks were <i>barely</i> even present. Even someone like Neji and Sasuke, who were expert ANBU members did not mask their trails this well. So he had to search the long way and before long, he found Naruto sitting on a large rock, overlooking the river, the roar of the waterfalls several meters to his left, as he stared at the flowing water. Kakashi decided to approach him after a minute or two, and stopped a few feet behind him.</p><p>&quot;Anything I can help you with, Hatake-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry. I should have told you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yet you didn&rsquo;t.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was to protect you.&quot; Kakashi stated, a desperate edge present in his voice.</p><p>Naruto faced him, eyes filled with rage. &quot;And have me thinking about him over and over again, wondering why I couldn&rsquo;t help him, stop him, wondering why he had to die? You call that protection? Damn you! I nearly went nuts after what happened then! Don&rsquo;t talk to me about protection, you bastard! Don&rsquo;t you fucking <i>dare</i>!&quot;</p><p>Every word was a blow to him, but he stood his ground. If he had to beat the living daylights out of his thick blonde head of his, he would. Teacher&rsquo;s son or not, he didn&rsquo;t care now.</p><p>&quot;It was my duty as a teacher to do what is best for my students.&quot; Kakashi said, trying hard not to snap.</p><p>&quot;Of course, of course.&quot; Naruto said sarcastically, turning back to look at the water. &quot;It&rsquo;s no use arguing with you. You were just doing it to protect me, after all.&quot;</p><p>Kakashi ground his teeth together. &quot;Naruto, look at me.&quot; He said with barely-contained anger. &quot;Look at me!&quot; He shouted, when Naruto didn&rsquo;t listen the first time. Much to his surprise, Naruto did turn to look at him. &quot;Tell me, at my face, that you hate me, and I swear to you that I will <i>never</i> bother you again.&quot;</p><p>Naruto continued to stare at him, before his eyes suddenly moved to a spot behind him. &quot;I hate you.&quot; He hissed.</p><p>&quot;Look at me! Not behind me!&quot; Kakashi snapped. Naruto jerked at his voice, the act itself seeming like a crack on his wall of nonchalance. Kakashi felt something inside him soften at the gesture he just witnessed, before Naruto before him vanished in a poof of chakra smoke. Kakashi found himself smiling softly.</p><p>Naruto does care.</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><i><p>He groaned at the finger running down his spine, gently doing a detour at his hips and trailing towards his stomach, before fingers spread out and caressed his chest, hot breath beating against his exposed throat. A groan escaped his lips as he felt soft ones press against his own, a warm and very wet tongue giving his lower lip a long lick, parting his lips. As they kissed, hands rubbed the side of his arms, as they trailed down to his hips, rubbing the tanned thighs, before crawling lower. He wrapped his arms around the smooth neck, his fingers grasping the soft strands of hair, tugging at them as he groaned when the lips left his and attacked his neck, teeth nibbling at the sensitive skin.</p><p>&quot;Hnn! More!&quot; He breathed out, groaning. &quot;Hnn! Kakashi!&quot;</p></i><p>&quot;Naruto.&quot; A hand came to his shoulder, and snapped his eyes open, staring at Haku&rsquo;s smiling face hovering above his from behind the couch. &quot;Dinner is ready.&quot;</p><p>Naruto blinked his daze away, and felt a blush cross his cheeks. The dream had been almost so real, so intense and he was suddenly feeling very hot. Shaking his head, he got up and headed for the bathroom, washing his face before joining Gaara and Haku at the table. After eating, Gaara placed a scroll on the table.</p><p>A mission scroll.</p><p>&quot;Target?&quot; Naruto asked.</p><p>&quot;Affiliates with Akatsuki.&quot; Gaara answered. &quot;Not big, but still a dangerous one. Eight people.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They&rsquo;re in the fire country.&quot; Haku added. &quot;It says we should complete it before tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>Naruto nodded, before looking up at the clock. &quot;We should get ready then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Haku answered, and began to clear the table.&nbsp;</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><p>It was four AM when the three made their way back to the village, smelling of blood and sweat and feeling very tired. Naruto had a rather deep gash on his shoulder, but nothing the Kyuubi couldn&rsquo;t handle healing. Haku and Gaara were fine, but they were worried.</p><p>Shower fresh and clothes in the washing machine spinning with detergent soap and water, Gaara approached Naruto. &quot;You were distracted tonight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was.&quot; Naruto admitted, and it was all because of one dream. And hell, their targets didn&rsquo;t even put up a fight. They had full advantage of the situation and yet, he came away with a gash on his shoulder. &quot;It&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t handle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go to him.&quot; Gaara said suddenly. Naruto looked up at him and blinked. Gaara shook his head and smiled. &quot;Just for once, throw everything away and get what <i>you</i> want.&quot; Gaara handed him his jacket. &quot;Go.&quot;</p><p>So Naruto left.&nbsp;</p><p>XXX&nbsp;</p><p>Kakashi woke up to three loud knocks coming from his front door. It was all he could do to not throw the pillow at it. His house was a mere room, with a kitchen and bathroom attached to it. He didn&rsquo;t have any couches or a coffee table, since his bed and bookshelf took up most of the space.</p><p>&quot;It better <i>not</i> be a mission.&quot; He groaned, and covered half of his face with his hair before padding towards the door. &quot;Coming, coming.&quot; He mumbled, and fumbled with the locks, throwing the door open. He blinked in surprise at finding Naruto standing in his doorway, looking up at him with an almost soft expression, but there was still a hard edge to it.</p><p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t hate you.&quot; Naruto said. In two strides he had his arms around Kakashi&rsquo;s neck, kissing him for all he was worth. Kakashi kicked the door shut, and bolted it with quick fluid motions of his hand before wrapping his arms around Naruto&rsquo;s slender frame, inhaling the barely noticeable sweet and manly scent.</p><p>Kakashi pinned Naruto against his door and stared at him, taking in the flushed cheeks and rosy parted lips. He leaned forward and gently licked the soft folds of Naruto&rsquo;s lips before straying to his ear. &quot;I love you. Always have, always will.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kiss me.&quot; Naruto answered, and Kakashi happily obliged.</p><p>In seconds, all articles of clothing were on the floor and Naruto was lying on the bed, Kakashi on top of him, lips kissing and sucking at his chest. Everything was so hot. Naruto swore that his surroundings looked rippled from heat. They were eager and hungry, not caring if everything was clumsy and rather rough because of the pulsing desire in them. Kakashi had to hold himself back and brought his fingers to Naruto&rsquo;s lips, prying them open and allowing Naruto&rsquo;s tongue to glaze over them, coating them thickly in saliva. He lowered his fingers towards Naruto&rsquo;s entrance, gently parting the tensed muscles, that relaxed, as if knowing what was going to happen. He pushed a finger in, then two, then three, making Naruto squirm and whisper gasping breaths of &lsquo;more&rsquo;.</p><p>&quot;You don&rsquo;t seem to feel pain.&quot; Kakashi whispered.</p><p>&quot;You&rsquo;re not my first.&quot; Naruto answered back, and for some reason, Kakashi felt something inside him snap at those words. &quot;Kiss me.&quot; Naruto whispered staring up at him through half lidded eyes, as Kakashi positioned himself for entry. Ever so slowly, he pushed himself forward, making Naruto throw his head back in pleasure, exposing his long smooth neck, the muscles around his stomach rippling as it tightened from the intrusion. &quot;Hnn! K-kakashi!&quot; He groaned, lips opening in a gasp.</p><p>Kakashi bent forward, capturing the parted lips in his, lifting one of Naruto&rsquo;s legs to his shoulders, supporting his weight by one hand beside Naruto&rsquo;s head and the other beside Naruto&rsquo;s hip. Naruto had one of his hands crawling up his arm, and resting on his shoulder, staring up at him with desire-coated eyes.</p><p>&quot;You&rsquo;re beautiful.&quot; Kakashi whispered taking in the entire and very erotic image in front of him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hnn! Kakashi.&quot; Naruto twisted making Kakashi&rsquo;s member flare in hot need. &quot;Move.&quot;</p><p>Kakashi shifted his hips and slowly picked up a rhythm, head dipped forward, lips parted and breathing hotly into Naruto&rsquo;s neck. A thin sheen of sweat covered the both of them as Naruto began to gasp out his name, incoherent and begging. Kakashi bit on to Naruto&rsquo;s shoulder as he heard Naruto give out an uncontrolled cry of release, hot and sticky liquid coating his stomach. Kakashi bit down harder as his release followed, making Naruto gasp out loud, his fingers digging into his shoulder and forearm. For moments, they remained like that, before Kakashi released his teeth from Naruto&rsquo;s shoulder, which was now red and bleeding. Kakashi watched in amazement as the small wound closed, and all that was left was the bruise of the bite, now looking like nothing more than a rather large hickey.</p><p>Kakashi gently eased himself out of Naruto and lay on his side, Naruto&rsquo;s head tilted to one side, lips parted and breathing loudly. Kakashi&rsquo;s shoulder and forearm were stinging from the grip Naruto had on them during his orgasm, but he didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>All because of one request/demand for a kiss, and they both somehow managed to fall asleep, naked and sated, as the first few rays of the morning sun crept up the horizon.</p></div>"

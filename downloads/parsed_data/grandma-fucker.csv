I was finally able just to spend some one on one time with her and it was a pretty great thing.  I wish that I could be with her forever and then again there's times that I just want to fuck Sam so hard.  I hate having hormones.  I'll talk to the world later when I feel like it.  You're all a bunch of mother fuckers!"

"event","I'm not sure whether I still have a girlfriend or not.  I realized how fast I rushed into things and how slow I have to take this relationship.  I was doing so much wrong and I was dating younger so obviously I was going to have to deal with immaturity.  I love the girl and everything, but I need to slow things down."

"event","My tongue feels so swollen.  I just got my tongue ring on Sunday and I'm completely swollen.  I can barely eat or drink or talk and it mother fucking sucks.  I couldn't get my lip rings done though because I was in so much pain.  I'm getting them done when I get back from the hockey tournament.  I don't want my mouth to be totally swollen for the games, so I can wait for a few weeks.  I hate not being able to eat normal foods.  There's a huge white ball of puss in the middle of my tongue, and a silver barbell (eight gage) in the middle of my tongue.  It looks fucking awesome, when it's not swollen.  But there is a good side; my girlfriend gets to play with it now.  And tomorrow is my one month anniversary.  Peace fuckers."

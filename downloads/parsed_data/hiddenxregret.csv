The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.

<i>it had been three days. such a short amount of time, yet it seemed like forever. to her amazement, she had stayed strong. strong in a sense that meant she was not going to give up. emotionaly, she was just the same as ever. or it seemed. she was desperate for changing, starving for truth. relentlessly pilfering others' thoughts that proved close to home. she had been there, done that, and survived. barely. this time she was going to make it out <b>alive</b>. 

change. she was dwelling on the concept for quite some time. had she changed? would she ever? how would she now? would it come too late? too many questions. the thing that had brought this all about in the first place. but what was this feeling? it was a sense of change, yet the confusion of whether or not it was the right kind. she always thought of change. just now more than ever. as of late, someone had always told her, <b>if you don't like something, do something about it.</b> more than anything, she wanted to take this advice. not only about simple everyday habits, but about everything. especially, in the situation she was currently in. when things like this came up in the past, she'd go the wrong direction and force out all who were important with an overdose of words. words that were meaningless no matter how much thought was put into it. the reason for this meaninglessness was simply that fact that it had been overdone, overplayed; redundant. she didn't want to be that way again. this was the inspiration for her three days. three days without going back to the person she knew so well and secretly longed to remain. the person who never learned from the past, but rather, dwelled profusly in it. when the time came, she would say to herself, <b>i'm going to change, i'm not going to do what i did before.</b> but hours, sometimes even minutes after this self declaration, she'd revert back, give in to old habits, and fall deeper into the infinite abyss that was her soul. no more.

this is the source of her amazement. these <b>three</b> days. it had been tough and will continue to be, but she will be stronger than yesterday. even though the tears periodically came, they were for the best. no more festering. albeit, a little festering never hurt anyone, but the way it ruled her life, change was for the best. no more extended periods of festering. it broke her heart too much to do so. no more paranoia. it just led to festering. no more second guessing. it just led to paranoia. no more dwelling in the past. it just lead to second guessing. only understanding. understanding, calmness, sincerity. she wanted to learn, wanted to grow, wanted to change. and she was.

feelings filled her head as she listened to music that would otherwise make her feel worse. she wondered about this. <b>why is it that when we feel lost and confused, we do not listen to songs that will lift our spirits, give us new insight, or make us feel better, but we must hear the words that relate to us, make us contemplate, make us feel worse. do we find comfort in knowing that at some point, someone felt as we do now and they survived, therefore, we can too? or is it that we wish to dewll on sore subjects until there is nothing left to dwell on and we are left empty and hopeless? are we venting or merely drowning in our own sorrow with the naiveness that a savior will pull us out just in time.</b> she looked at her playlist as she contemplated these questions. <b>and why do i follow suit?</b> she sat in thought. believing that it was a mixture all those reasons for which she listened to the same old theme songs. <b>i guess some things never change</b>. this, however, was a lack of change that she could handle. it was the way it calmed her down that made her okay with it all.

she sighed. all things considered, she was now ripe with anticipation. she knew she was doing the right thing and that she would become a better, stronger person from it. and this was a change she could live with."

<b>I give myself very good advice,
But I very seldom follow it.
That explains the trouble that
I'm always in.
Be patient is very good advice,
but the waiting makes me curious.
And I'd love the change,
should something strange begin.
Well, I went along my merry way,
and I never stopped to reason.
I should have known there'd be a price to pay, some day.
Some day.
I give myself very good advice,
but I very seldom follow it.
Will I ever learn to do the things I should?
Should I ever learn to do the things I should?</b>

<i>we all go through life giving and receiving advice. we also go through life not following through on what advice has been given to us. why do we ask for advice if we had no intention of using it? the answer, for me, is simple. we ask for advice because we want to hear that what we want to do is what is right. most often when we ask for advice we already have a plan for ourselves that we intend to follow through with. we want the reassurance that we will be doing the right thing. when given a peice of advice, it takes a lot of courage to actually take the advice to heart instead of say ""nah, you're wrong... that'll make things worse.""  but how are we to really know? advice, like many other things, come with a price and with the need for trust. trusting someone's advice over your own is something not many can do. i, for one, have had a terrible time doing so. only recently have i been put throught situations in which i trust others' advice over my own. and in those cases, i made the right choice. now more than ever, i wanted to go back to old habits and do what i usually do in situations like my current, but i've been strong, miraculously, and i feel that the advice i have taken is the best. sometimes advice is harsh and you don't take it for that reason, but it not good to shove away everything you think will hurt you. sometimes it's for the best. you just have to know when to take what and you have to trust that it's right. follow your instincts, but never forget to follow your heart."

<i>""Yes, sooner or later it comes our way,""</i> he answered.... <i>""One day, just as we're about to give up hope, it suddenly appears. Then new horizons open up, and it's as though a voice had called out, 'Here it is!' You feel a need to tell a certain person everything about your life, to give him everything, sacrifice everything to him! You don't have to explain anything to each other, you guess each other's thoughts. You've already seen each other, in your dreams.""</i> He was looking at her. <i>""At last the treasure you sought so long is there in front of you, gleaming and sparkling. Yet you still have doubts, you're afraid to believe in it, you're dazzled, as though you'd suddenly come from darkness into light.""</i>"

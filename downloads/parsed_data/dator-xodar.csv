"event","This August has been hard for my Girlfriend and I.
She is facing a juncture that I would be hard pressed to deal well with.
She has a cervical disk that is putting pressure on her nerves that run through her spine. She is in intolerable pain. So much pain that she is on disability. Her fear is that her job will replace her if she is unable to come back to work in a timely fashion.

She loves her job. She is one of those few people that get a job that they really love doing that makes them feel better and simply does not just provide money. 
Her condition is breaking down her spirit.

 I do everything I can to keep her going and try to research the problem and find out other options that she can do. Of all medical problems herniated disks seem to be one of the hardest things to correct diagnose and get overall great results from various techniques to deal with them. 

The first Doctor we went to has suggested a surgery that involves a anterior approach (through her throat) to her spine.
Because of other surgeries and some of the side effects we are not sold on this approach that involves screwing two vertebrae together and patching it with a titanium plate.
Needless to say she has been distraught over making a proper decision for her. It has also put a strain on our relationship.
She has even tried to break up with me.

After our wonderful trip to LA in May and her trip earlier in the Spring in London, everything has gone bad for her health..The pain she goes through makes her physically nauseous and having someone touching her unbearable at times.

If anyone knows a neurosurgeon that could do a consult, I'd like to talk with someone who personally knows a doctor that could do a procedure that is not as invasive or something along non-traditional lines.Chiropractors cannot help her condition in fact they can make matters worse. The pressure being put on the nerve could be made worse by joint manipulation in the area.
I wanted to blog and get back into talking about what is going on with me, but it's about my girl right now. She needs me."

Also the sound quality is amazing.
Yes better than cd's

True there is limited availability but the artists I am into now definitely will be pressed.

Besides rediscovered interest in music, I am in the process of looking for employment. the task has been difficult but I feel that I have alot more to offer employers now.
I am working on two projects a corporate id project and a project that I can't discuss due to legal wranglings.
As soon they are done I'll let y'all know.

"event","Over the last week I have been trying to get help with writing a resume. I am not a writer. I am not that great at it.
So I asked around and thought of 2 people that were very good writers.
Unfortunately they both are very unreliable. After about 8 emails each concerning the subject and being canceled on to meet I have given up on asking them to help any further. It's not like I am paying them to do this but I thought that their word meant something.
Anyway I went to the library and picked up some books on the subject hopefully I'll get something usable. I have lost a week of not being able to send out a resume.
I have not bothered to further contact either person. They have not responded to other emails or calls
This is not the first nor last time something like this will happen. I am just wondering if other people share  the difficulty of having people that are close be so unreliable?"

There has been a lot of death amongst my friends and I have been reluctant to discuss it much. I have lost touch with just socializing and being comfortable in my own skin.. I am concerned about how I am dealing with stress and my lack of a social life.

Uncharacteristically I have gained back all the weight that I lost when I was 22- 26 and I have discovered that it's harder on this end of things to get to a reasonable weight. I have been lax in my maintenance of ""me"".

I need to just get in gear and join the working throng, yet I seem to be less confident of my abilities even after learning so much.
 
I am a contradiction of having all these new abilities yet feeling inadequate to the task.
I'm just going to write and hope that I can work out through writing what I am not able to express to a close by friend.

Period.Top of the list.
They are awesome.There is a short video that showcases some of their music and background.
They were at the 9:30 club in DC a few days ago.It sounds like they are back east right now. If you can see them go. You won't be disappointed... and ladies I'll understand if you get a Rockstar Crush from the lead singer, Justin.

3. Response and content. 
Evidently I am significantly more interesting in person and what I say here is not really of vast importance.Even after writing something of importance it's really a crap shoot if I get feedback. I know it is not a requirement to respond to everything someone reads ... I have never thought that I would be so uninteresting to people. I tried a Less is more with entries and that did not work with my blog. When I was willing to make frequent entries it was either too difficult for people to read or people just lost interest in my daily struggles.
 Seemingly my life is not interesting. All I do is work. I have no circle of friends to hang out with or write about here. All I do is work and stay focused to hopefully have a better life. Maybe once I reach my goal I will be of interest, until then I'll just place this message up and then move on.Ironically I suggested a friend start a blog and thier blog has thrived and they have a daily readership of @ 50 people. So I have no one to blame but myself.

""The rise of virtual worlds such as Second Life is making it easier for companies to justify hiring offshore workers for tasks that may include building virtual offices or even working as virtual-world ""meeters and greeters.""

The market for outsourced virtual-world services is still very new, but businesses increasingly are taking an interest in the likes of Second Life, so momentum is likely to build. 

Last month, news emerged of a partnership between a Chinese online-entertainment company and Entropia Universe, a virtual world with a science fiction theme, to create a virtual economy that could provide as many as 10,000 jobs. 

Over the longer term, customer contact jobs, including those for help desk and call center services--could migrate into virtual worlds, where customers can be both informed and entertained.""

Were you in Dolores Park (San Francisco) last night? PLEASE HELP OUT!!

Roisin (pronounced Row-Sheen) Isner, drummer for the San Francisco band Tinkture lost her hand in Dolores Park last night watching the fireworks. Her dad sent the email below to some local media outlets...

Subject: Roisin Isner, Tinkture drummer

Hello,
I am Roisin's father. July 4th, Roisin and friends were in Dolores Park watching fireworks. Some stupid piece of shit threw an M60 at them. It landed on Roisin's right hand and blew it apart. She will undego surgery later this morning but it doesn't look good. Most likely she will lose her index finger; second and third fingers will also be permanently impaired and disfigured. Needless to say, her musical career is over.

I want this fucker. Media attention will help flush him out. People know who did it and I'm offering $20,000 for a name. Please do whatever is necessary to get the story out. Do so and I will reward you as well.

Thank you,
Chris Isner

"event","While watching G4 I found out about this experience called Second life.

http://secondlife.com/

 It seems similar to Sims. It has online content and virtual money that can be converted into real money(no joke) and the digital inventions businesses that you have there are owned by the creator. They retain intellectual property rights.The environments are created in some cases by professional digital artists.

(Anshe Chung's Dreamland
With more than 500 regions of professionally designed landscapes, Dreamland is organized in 16 themed zones, each hosting a unique lifestyle, experience or architectural style. Plush City, the capital of Dreamland, is Second Life's largest business and entertainment district, a bustling metropolis full of life and commerce. Governments, fortune 100 companies, billionaires and celebrities have chosen Dreamland as their virtual home, as have thousands of enthusiastic residents.)

Strange but in some way intellectually and philosophically interesting. Creating lives,businesses, homes,ideas and inventions virtually. Is reality that distasteful and unable to attain those things that we can click into existence in the virtual world? Possibly.
 Perhaps it is just a distraction. escapism.. nothing more than entertainment outside of the real world. Maybe this ""artificial reality complete with Avatar versions of Concerts( Suzanne Vega had a Avatar and guitar created for a in environment concert)Probably less expensive than to see her in this reality.
Is it just me or is this just stunning?

"event","This is for all of my friends that Smoke.
Don't.
Stop now.
Period.
Arron used to smoke.
Now he is fighting cancer again. He has had several surgeries and is not in the hospital again looking at his third bout with Chemotherapy. He and I worked together for years at The Art Store in LA and I was there when he was first diagnosed for cancer in 1994.I was there to see him fight through cancer the first time.. when he was tired sick,drained,nauseous.. how people alienated themselves from him.. all of that pain and here he is back in a fight for his life.It just seems unfair.
We all thought he was past this. He was blessed with the ability to still have children.. it was thought that he and his wife would not be able to. 
Hen he had spotting. Small tumors that were removed.. Then Tyler his youngest is in the hospital fighting a cancer known as neuroblastoma.
Ivy is a amazing woman and has been with Arron since I can remember she sponsors a site that keep me up to date on what is happening with my bud's family. 
I honestly do not know where her strength comes from.
But I can safely guess it's her love.
The past few months have been very difficult for my friends and I am hoping that all these horrible events will pass and my friends can see them through. I also got news today from another friend that his brother's wife has cancer.
 I have known both of these men for over ten years and I am heartbroken that they have to deal with this.
I will see Arron this weekend I have to be there for him.

"event","During the last few weeks I have had alot on my plate. I have just finished finals and the school quarter is over.
some examples
However there have been other things happening that made the latter much harder to deal with. My Gf's dad was rooming with a man named Lloyd. He was a pretty gentle guy that we had come to know during our visits to Modesto. He was shot to death @ 3 weeks ago. During this time we were being supportive of my Gf's dad as he in turn had to deal with lloyd's vulture like family.There are no leads to the case.

Then It got very ugly. Dan ( GF's dad) at one point had to break into his own home.We managed to get everything in some state of calm however there are still lingering issues that will need to hopefully just pan out for Dan.
My stepfather's brother Micheal was also murdered @ a week before LLoyd but I did not know about it until a few days after Lloyd was killed.
 I have very few memories of Micheal save for one time after meeting him after watching airplanes take off at National airport. 
Both D and I have been kind of weirded out about violence on News channels and in general. It seems that the year has been filled with unexpected passings and strange news.
I was very angry and upset during the weeks I had to grieve It was just a mass of feelings and emotions I really had no place to put.
It's good to be on the other side of this but the sadness kind of lingers."

      <P>
      You have all the sophistication and charm one would expect from such a high-class hare. Very upbeat and generally laid-back, you are remarkably calm and peaceful even in the midst of the most stressful of situations. On those rare occasions that your anger is aroused, your retaliation usually results in embarrassing the aggressor and laying-bare how foolish he or she really is -- rather than doing any real harm. You likely have many friends and more than a few admirers and would make an excellent leader, if you had any interest in being one. But, being a leader would require hard work and attention to detail, both qualities you are lacking in. In fact, if you are not careful, your laid-back attitude will often lead you to drift through life completely oblivious to the changes happening around you. You also tend to have a horrible sense of direction.

This is a very dangerous site for me. I thought I'd share in the visual delight. They also have a book @ the King Kong movie ( Yes I know not so great a movie, but the concept art is amazing.)So for all of you low meets high tech sci fi guys like me will really enjoy the website.
This weekend was a much needed get away for Me and Danyele. We stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel

http://www.travelpost.com/hotels/photos/Galleria_Park_Hotel/p17028

had dinner there friday and went out with my friend Lan and her friend fron SD peter. Went to a very good hip hop joint in the mission called Duplex

http://duplexsf.com/.

And as you might have read in an earlier post I am now the Apt. manager for my building. Just scant minutes ago I got to punt a person who was sleeping in the laundry room! Good times...
Not litterally but I had to ask him to leave.
Now off to get my grub on and BBQ!!

NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- The costumed pirate wore a plumed hat and held a squat bottle labeled ""rum"" in his hand. Inside the bottle, dark liquid sloshed and fizzed. 

""It's Coke. I didn't think rum would be appropriate at a school,"" said Capt. Arrrghdee (pronounced R.D., with ""emphasis on the arrrrrrr""), otherwise known as Richard Reid of Deer Park, Texas. 

He's among at least 750 people attending ""Pyratecon,"" a New Orleans weekend of piratical dress-up and lore. The weekend gathering also includes good deeds, such as giving supplies to a school re-emerging from Hurricane Katrina.

"event","Excerpts from a Cat's Daily Diary:

Day 683 of my captivity:

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little
dangling objects.

They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other
inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry
nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the
rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat
something in order to keep up my strength. The only
thing that keeps me going is my dream of
escape.

In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on
the floor.

Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless
body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear
into their hearts, since it clearly
demonstrates of what I am capable. However, they
merely made condescendi ng comments about what a 'good
little hunter' I am. The audacity!

There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices
tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the
duration of the event. However, I could hear the
noises and smell the food. I overheard that my
confinement was due to the power of 'allergies.' I
must learn what this means, and how to use it to my
advantage.

Today I was almost successful in an attempt to
assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his
feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow
-- but at the top of the stairs.

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are
flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special
privileges. He is regularly released - and
seems to be more than willing to return. He is
obviously retarded! The bird has got to be an
informant. I observe him communicating with the
guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my
every move. My captors have arrange d protective
custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is
safe..... .. for now.."

"event","Once upon a time I did not feel separate from my people specifically Black... today not only did I fail to make a point I closed the door on a pointless chapter. 
My experience African American youth are lost. They respect nothing but violence and money. There is no true respect to be found at all... The rare exceptions that I can relate to..to an extent are people that I go to school with because we share same goals.. but in the Real World.. Me being an artist in the Black community is worthless.. I am not valued or sought after.. I feel like a novelty act among my own people..If I have some obviously marketable quality it would be a different story.And to be honest.. I am equally to blame for their behavior because me and every other person that claims to be black have let the problems of classism and material wealth overshadow values.
I have always believed that as a Black Man I am responsible for trying to uplift.. to not fall into stereotypes.. and to check those that are bringing everyone down with foolish behavior... But I am not Captain America.. No one will listen to my words.  People Just want people to mind their own business regardless if the behavior of a race causes so much damage that it is irreparable. Nowadays blacks call themselves n#####..
If thats what they want to be it's their right to do so.
 They are right..It's none of my business anymore.
I'm tired of trying."

Well after about 7 hrs of looking I finally found a african american animator That was working on Disney films since the early 50's

 Now Why doesnt anyone mention him....
after metasearching for african american animators,Library of congress' web site.. nothing.
Even Instuctors at school had their doubts about finding a black animator.

Floyd Norman started working as an animation artist for the Walt Disney studio on Sleeping Beauty and eventually graduated to the story department where he did story sketch on The Jungle Book. This was the last film Walt Disney personally supervised.

In the mid-sixties, Floyd and his associates launched their own production company, Vignette Films, Inc. Floyd served as writer-director in the production of educational media. Vignette Films, Inc. was one of the first companies to produce films on the subject of African-American history.

During the seventies, Floyd wrote and produced animated segments for Sesame Street, Villa Alegre, and dozens of educational films.  Also, Floyd supervised animation layout at Hanna-Barbera Productions and storyboarded several shows including The Flintstones, Smurfs, and Scooby Doo.  He wrote scripts for The Quicky Koala Show, The Real Ghostbusters, and Monster Tales.

Floyd returned to Disney in the early eighties to join the Disney Publishing Group. He wrote the syndicated Mickey Mouse comic strip and contributed stories for Disney Comics.  As Project Supervisor in Creative Development Publishing, Floyd created, wrote and designed several children's books. After a ten year absence from film, Floyd returned to his roots doing story work on several feature length Disney animated films, Hunchback, Mulan, Tigger Movie, Dinosaur, and Toy Story 2.

Floyd continued work in television storyboarding such shows as Garfield and Mother Goose and Grim. The Cartoon Network called on him to script several wacky scripts for their new show, Cow and Chicken.

He was the only black friend that respected me, what I represeneted and treated me as a man not a sterotype.The career I have chosen has next to none in the realm of Black representation.

I was on a mind to lay your burden down
And leave you where you stood
You believed I could
Youd seen it done before
I could read your thoughts
And tell you what you saw
And never say a word
But now that is gone
Over with and done
And never to return

I can tell you why
People die alone
I can tell you why
The shadow on the sun

Staring at the loss
Looking for the cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned

I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you on
The shadow on the sun

Shapes of every size
Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within
Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lived inside my skin

I can tell you why
People go insane

windows XP sytem problem.

now for the good news...


I can still legally vote... However there may be some out there that don't want people like me to vote...
33 house members voted against the Fannie Lou Hammer, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act. 
NAACP President Bruce S. Gordon said today's passage of the Fannie Lou Hammer, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act (VRA) ""is an example of how non-partisan political action can serve the best interests of our community."" The House voted 390-33 to approve the bill without amendments. 

The bi-partisan majority beat back attempts by some House radicals to hijack the legislation. Three key sections due to expire next year were reauthorized. These provisions are Section 5, which requires covered jurisdictions with a long history of voting discrimination to obtain approval or ""preclearance"" before making any changes to their voting practices.  

Section 203 requires covered jurisdictions to provide language assistance to citizens who are limited-English proficient.  Sections 6-9 authorizes the federal government to use observers in elections to monitor VRA compliance.

More negative reaction than I had thought.. However looking over some of the men that voted against.. I was not suprised.

Some of those who voted against

Bonner, Alabama. Shocking.
Everett, Alabama.
Franks, Trent, Arizona 
Shadegg, Arizona 

Herger, California
Doolittle, California
And about HALF of the Georgia representatives voted against.

It looks like I may have to buy a scanner. I did not really want to go that route. I don't use one often but making a trip into the city to scan a document and come back takes up a fair chunk of time and money... not to mention whatever a place will charge. Normally It would not be a big issue I could do it at school.

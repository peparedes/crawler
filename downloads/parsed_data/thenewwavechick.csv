I discovered a group Glenn is part of called Honeyroot and they have a great cover of, Love Will Tear Us Apart.  
That's all for now.  :)"

"event","Tech question: The laptop I'm borrowing is a Dell Inspiration 2650 and since I'm using it as a regular computer instead of a portable one do you think it's okay to take the battery out? I have noticed the computer gets pretty hot, which I've read is normal for laptops. I have also read the battery can lose life if it's in the heat too long.  My boss, who is letting me borrow the laptop said the battery isn't good anyway, but I don't know how good it is to leave it in if it's going to be plugged in all the time. I've never used a laptop and I'm just wondering about his. And also, is it good to leave the laptop on for hours or should I shut it down after a while. As I said before, I notice it does get hot. It's well ventilated, so that's no issue. I just don't want to ruin anything since it's not my computer."

"event","Have you discovered you had an allergy to something that you didn't know about until that thing cause an allergic reaction?  This is the second time this has happened to me.  The first time was when I took Sulurmeth and found out I'm allergic to sulfur based antibiotics.  
Well, I'm now thinking I might have a latex or adhesive allergy.  I had this boil on the front of my neck and I covered it with this waterproof band aid.  When I took it off this morning, I got this horrible red rash and it started blistering.  I had to go to the gynocologists today anyway, so I thought I'd have him look at it.  He thinks I may have a latex allergy an told me to just monitor the area and put a non latex bandage on it.  I'm not sure he's right, I think I may have an allergy to the adhesive, because I remember when I have had the band aid on my arms it's hard for it to come off.  My skin sticks to tha band aid and it sometimes is hard to come off and sometimes it leaves a red area.  
I'm going to look for an alltergist and see if I can get an appointment to see them.  If not, I will wait until next week when I see the general surgeon to see what he says.  
Right now, it feels like I have a really bad sunburn.  If you have ever had this happen to you, what did you do?"

Yesterday, Buffalo had their annual St. Patty's Day parade on Delaware Ave.  I didn't go, because I went once and there were too many drunken idiots there.  It left a bad taste on my mouth when this woman in a wheelchair was trying to see and a bunch of drunken asswipes wouldn't move.  Sometimes drinking brings the worst out in people.
I'm celebrating St. Pattys Day late, because my Mom's having a corned beef and cabbage dinner next weekend with my aunt, uncle and grandparents.  I'm going to drink Guinness and listen to some great Celtic music.  
I love this time of year, mainly because I can listen to Celtic music. 
If you're going to celebrate tomorrow, don't drink & drive.  :)"

I hate this and I hate having infections.  I was tested for several things including diabetes.  I'm a candidate for it and I'm going to get help with changing my diet and getting on a better routine.  
I feel fine during the day but at night I am in pain.  I'm going for a GI test next Friday to see how my stomach is holding out.  I totally don't like it.  I'm taking Aleve for the pain, which is tolerable, I guess.

To listen to his show, go to http://www.wfdu.fm and if you like his show, call 1-201-692-2012 or you can pledge on the site.  I'd love to see him do well tonight.  So please listen and help out.  I wouldn't do this if I didn't care.  This is the last week to pledge."

I love the winter weather.....NOT.  I got a ride in to work today, which was nice.  Buffalo doesn't close when the weather is bad.  Some places close when there is an inch of snow on the ground.  I know I may bitch and complain sometimes about the weather, but I'd rather take this weather over hurricaines or tornadoes.  
People think Buffalo is the snow capital of the country, but places like Syracuse and Watertown, NY both get more snow than Buffalo does.  It's because Lake Ontario is shallow and it stays warmer than the other lakes.  
I'm glad I live in Buffalo.  :)"

I used to have their CDs, but during some money trouble I traded them in, and I've been looking for their albums: ""Herd of Instinct"" and ""Fields & Waves"" ever since.  They have a very techno sound and I loved their music.  
If anyone knows of where to find their material or has them on CD or .mp3 let me know.  Thanks."

Craig Ferguson   	     
Mainstage Theatre
Friday, October 5

An Evening of Great Stand-Up Comedy!

Craig FergusonCraig Ferguson entered the world of late night comedy following a diverse and eclectic career that encompasses film, television and the stage. Since taking the helm of the Late, Late Show on January 3, 2005, the show has set all-time viewer records. Additionally, Craig recently received his first Emmy nomination for his work on the Late, Late Show.
 
Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Ferguson got his start in the entertainment industry as a drummer for some of the worst punk bands in the U.K., a profession he held for several years. Following his musical stint, he began bartending in a local pub in Glasgow where he was introduced to Michael Boyd, the artistic director of The Tron Theatre in Glasgow, who persuaded Ferguson to give acting a go. After several low paying acting gigs, Ferguson discovered he had a knack for comedy and was soon the star of his own BBC television show, The Ferguson Theory.
 
After several stints on the English comedy circuit, Ferguson brought his act to America in 1995 to star with Betty White and Marie Osmond in the ABC comedy Maybe This Time. After the show ended, ABC decided to add the talented Scotsman to The Drew Carey Show, playing Drew Carey's boss, Nigel Wick, from 1996-2003.

Ferguson has also starred in, written or directed several feature films.  In April 2006, he debuted his first novel entitled Between The Bridge and The River, which became a critically acclaimed bestseller.

"event","Lately, I've been getting several phone calls from this telemarketing agency in Michigan.  I usually screen my calls for telemarketers and I got this # for Phone Bank Systems, the phone # is 517-203-1400 (I normally wouldn't put a phone # here, but I needed to warn you all).  I called the # and left a message for them to stop calling me.  They call at all hours of the day, and they are getting to be too much.  I'm thinking of reporting them to my phone company and the BBB of Michigan (the number is from East Lansing, MI)."

"event","This if from my friend Brian (or DJDioFan at <a href=""http://www.renegaderadionetwork.com"">Renegade Retro</a>:

Allow me to introduce myself to those who may not know me. I am DJ Diofan. I Produce and host Metal Shop on <A HREF=""http://www.renegaderetro.com/"" TARGET=""_blank"">Renegade Retro</A> Which Airs Sundays at 10 PM Eastern.

The reason I post this Bulletin is not to promote my show or the station it airs on (Although it couldn't hurt for you to tune in either *Grin* ), No I'm here with an IDEA on how to help save Internet Radio.
If you've viewed my profile, or my fellow DJ's Profile, or virtually ANY Internet Radio Station profile on myspace, you know these are perilous times for Internet Radio. As a DJ as well as a Listener of Internet Radio, I came up with a possible Idea for PSA's (For those not fluent in Radio-Speak, PSA means ""Public Service Announcement"" a form of on-air advertising.) My idea is simply this...

<U>DJ's from Affected radio stations</U> (ALL Net Radio in the USA..this is YOU) make a short 1-2 minute PSA about why the CRB Decision should be repealed. 

<U>Listeners</U> You too can make a PSA...Even if you don't have an MP3 editor..Make a short 1-2 minute voice recording (Preferably Wav or MP3) of what Internet Radio means to you and why you think the CRB ruling should be repealed! (You must give permission in Writing to use your voice for legal reasons.)

I think if we all get together on this, We can add another arsenal to the fight against this unfair decision and possibly SAVE Net Radio!

You can PM Me on Yahoo Messenger at dj_diofan or visit my profile at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rr_metal_shop"">RR Metal Shop</A> for more info on contacting me/sending me your PSA.

I will see to it that I get the PSA to as many DJ's and Stations as I can!"

Right now, my friend, Ghosty on the Radio is doing his show, ""That Modern Rock Show.  He plays stuff from today (The Killers, Goldfrapp, Artic Monkeys) and classic stuff (The Smiths, Ultravox, Echo and the Bunnymen) listen to his show.  This is the last week the station is doing their pledge drive and if you like what you hear call him at 201-692-2012 or go to the WFDU site and pledge what you can.  
To listen online, go to the Warp Radio button and click it.  You must have Windows Media Player installed to listen.  His show is awesome, so please listen and if you can pledge.  :)  His show is on now until 1am EST."

Go to <a href=""http://www.wfdu.fm"">WFDU</a> and click Warp Radio.  You have to have Windows Media Player.  If you like his show WFDU is doing their annual February pledge drive, and they are looking for pledges.  So if you like his show go and pledge.  If he doesn't get pledges then his show goes off the air.  
I am not a fan of pledge drives, but this is important since Ghosty is a good friend of mine, and I want to help him as much as I can.  I already gave $40 to his show, so it's your turn.  Again, go listen to his show and if you like his show pledge.  You can pledge any amount from 45 to whatever you can think of.  Thanks.  :D"

<lj-cut text=""Life Goes On"">
<i>Life goes on and on and on
If you think it's al gone wrong
Go on and on and on 

Life's a con a con a con
If you think you can't go on
Go on and on and on 

But always remember
This is the happiest day of your life 

Life goes on and on and on
If you think it's al gone wrong
Go on and on and on 

Life's a con a con a con
If you think you can't go on
Go on and on and on 

And as the years they move along
I see it now, there's something wrong
'Cos life is for always
Take your time
Who cares what fools say
I don't mind
'Cos this is my day
I'll live it my way
Today, there's just today 

Life goes on and on and on
If you think it's al gone wrong
Go on and on and on 

Life's a con a con a con
If you think you can't go on
Go on and on and on</i></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The Dog"">
<i>She wanders alone through the night
A child with eyes burning bright
She extends her arms for an embrace a tiny smile
Her ruby lips on her doll- like face 

The danger's a mystery here
As she invites you to hold her near
Her mirrored image could not be linked to
A woman's mind so sharp and so distinct 

Like a swimmer in a secret sea
Undecayed for all eternity
Claudia
Better stay away from Claudia 

The silkiness of her lips
As she bends low to kiss
A tiny seductress in ringlets and pearls you reel
In madness as the whole world about you whirls 

Like the tinkle of a small silver bell
Her voice will put you under her spell
A crushed crysanthemum in her hand a beautiful doll of death
She'll take your dying breath 

Like a swimmer in a secret sea
Undecayed for all eternity
Claudia
Better stay away from Claudia
Like a swimmer in a secret sea
Undecayed for all eternity
Claudia
Better stay away from Claudia</i>

BTW, <b>The Dog</b> is about Claudia, from Anne Rice's book, <i>Interview With the Vampire</i>."

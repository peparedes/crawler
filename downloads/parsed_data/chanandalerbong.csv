"event","Well Heathers Surprise Party (aka THE GOLF OUTING) went off without a hitch. It was on Monday, I went to the Hanahan's home right after work to help setup. Me and Nass blew up a few ballons becuase Nass and Matt wasted all the helium. Then Megan came home, and we went to the Dollar Store to get more balloons. And I got Heather's Presents. First of all, the bag was said, ""Dear God, I'm glad I have someone to talk to."" So that inspired the ""DEAR GOD"" Notepads and Notebook. Then I got her a Pirate HAt, and I love Baseball Keychain, a Ink dotter for Bingo, and the gem THe book of Sarah. I know what you are thinking, HEr name is heather. But my quick wit inspired me to change all the Sarah's to heathers. Then me and Megan picked out balloons. The only ones they had were cheap and very small HAPPY BIRTHDAY Balloons. and OVER THE HILL BALLOONS that were actually good ones. So we bought both. Then we went back to the hanahans and blew them up and wrote inside jokes on the balloons. Mrs. Hanahan told us to put the balloons in the pool, so we did. I went back down to the yard to put more in, and all the balloons flew out of the pool, and half of them popped in the grass. I was wicked pissed. So then people arrived, and we were all hanging around in the backyard, and then we heard Shaff bringing heather back. So we all went by the gate, and it opend. And only chris yelled surprise. I was and then no one else did, so I stopped. WE WASTED THE GOOD SURPRISE ON YOU! Then Felicia came a little while later, and we went to pick up Jenna. When we got back, Me, Nass, Shaff, Chris, Heather, and Krystal went swimming. It was freaking freezing, but we all toughed it out. Then we ate and heather opened presents...she was lauging so much at my gifts. Then ppl decided to go swimming again...i didn't becuase it was even colder than before. Then we got a fire started and just hung out for a little while longer. It was a great party. I had to leave at like 10:50 becuase I had work in the moring and had to be in by 11:00. They were all playing Ghost in the Graveyard. 

Yesterday--- After Work, I took Megan, Heather, and Felicia to Best Buy in Matteson. Megan wanted to buy Edward Scissorhands. After Best Buy, we went across the street to Lincoln Mall and I got Ice Cream at Dairy Queen. I called a blizzard a blitz on accident, cause I am so used to Blitz up at Twist N Shake, the girl was like YOU MEAN BLIZZARD!!!!!! I was like...Yes.. I'm sorry. NO one wanted to go to the mall and i said, Real Quick I just want Dairy Queen. So then Fe and Heather looked at shoes in a store and Megan went to the bathroom. And then we passed Dairy Queen on the way out and they ALL wanted Ice Cream. Felicia called it a Blitz to on purpose and the lady yelled at her too. Felicia is like, OH, Sorry. Have you ever been to Twist N Shake, Cause they call them Blitzes there. Then we all came back to my house, watched Edward Scissorhands, and went to McDonalds for dinner. Then I dropped them off and Came home and watched Family Guy on dvd. I always fall asleep towards like 10:30 in the middle of an episode...IT really ticks me off. DAMN ME!

YESTERDAY- I woke up around 9:00, showered and such and then went to Ambrosinos for my mom. Then I was going to Chicago Ridge to vist my 2nd cousin Barb and her kids. I used to babysit them ALL the time but stopped a 2 years ago b/c Mike (the son) got old enough to babysit. But, I could not find my keys. WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY. I looked all over the damn house. I had put mail in the mailbox for my mom, so I thought maybe I put it in there. As I journeyed to the mailbox and the expedition was fruitless, I was walking up the front steps and where were my keys? In the front door in the keyhole. I left them in there as I was coming in w/the groceries.Then I left to go see my cousins. Well Barb was not there so for about an Hour I caught up with Mike and Matt. Then She came home and we waited for my other Cousin Ryan to come home from summer school. He is autistic and can not talk. so I thought! He is improving so much! He can say Mom, Dad, Mike, and Matt. And Hi and Bye. He is such a good kid So Barb, Matt, Ryan and his's therapist Shannon went to Chicago Ridge Mall for lunch. I GOT TACO BELL! Ah, how I love Taco Bell. Then me matt and barb went to this new Sport's Store- Steve and Barrys. EVERYTHING is 7.98. WHat A Country! So then we went back to Barbs house and I stayed and talked to her for an hour or so. It was good to see her. Then I came home, ate dinner, and went to pick up Felicia. After much debate, we decided to go Bowling. We tried THUNDERBowl, but it was LEAGUE day, so then we went to Centenial Lanes is Tinley. Needless to say, I lost. So then we went to a park by Mokena Elementary. It is a huge wooden fort. I spun Fe on the tire swing and she almost got sick. Then we went to Mokena Video and rented some stuff. We came home just in Time for OZ. That is a great show. So VIOLENT! Then Me and fe were playing a Video game and realized it was 11:320. And I could not drive her home cuase it was passed Curfew (MY PARENTS ARE SO GAY ABOUT THAT WHOLE COUNTY CURFEW THING) Well I had to drive her home anyway...When I got home I watched TV for a bit, and the went to sleep around 2AM. 

ON TO TODAY- I woke up around 11:30 and layed around until 3. @ 3 I got in the shower and then layed around some more until after dinner around 6. Then I went to the store to get some stuff for my mom. Then came home, dropped of the groceries, then went to Bagwells to give my sister her glasses. Then I came home, talked to Heather. me her and Megan went to that Park @ Mokena Elementary. We were spinning on the Merry Go Round, and some creepy kid (maybe a freshman) was like Oh, I can help. After a while me and Heather were kind of freaked out, so we went over to the tire swing. Well then he came over there too. So as I was pushing Heather on the swing it hit the kid, and heather ""ACCIDENTALLY"" Kicked him. OOPS. Then me and Heather and Megan went back to there house to play SIMPSONS CLUE ( I never on in the two games we played) Then we played B.S. and Sonic 2 + 3 on GameCube. Then I came home and set up Megan's journal..Ah That was a long one."

""Receive your first DRIVERS LICESNSE but aren't able to drive casue your mother is over protective"" Collect a LIFE TILE! 

Yea...that really blows. My mom is being a crazy person and not letting me drive. So that's cool.

Tuesday was boring as usual except Geometry of of course! I got moved. (What a surprise!)


OK... On to today. Let's see, Chem was ok...we learned something new, VERY VERY Easy... Gym- We had to go out for softball. Our team only had 6players today, needless to say we lost. Finished the Crucible  and took a quiz on the vocab VERY Easy. MADE TACO SALAD for our What's for Dinner Picnic? DON't ASK!!!!! Spanish was awesome becasue half of our class was gone b/c of SIX FLAGS Day. Then Lunch/Study NORMAL AS USUAL... Geometry...I ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE DOING!! surprise! (IT's because it is Algebra stuff) History...Stew rambled on and on and on and on...You get the picture. I slept..


So then I came home and did my Geometry homework, which took a while because it was alll graphs. Then I did this little history handout and then made a handout for our 60's day on Friday. Then I worked on some of my Crucible Study Questions that are due Friday.

Anyone else ready for the end of school.!? The only hard finals I have are Geometry and Spanish III. Chemistry FUNDAMENTALS IS THE GREATEST CLASS! We get to use sooo much shit on our final. These flowcharts make it IMPOSSIBLE TO FAIL. SO that's good. FRIDAY IS THE BONFIRE! (Hopefully I can drive there and get Felicia) Wait, is DRIVING what you use the license for? Later."

We were going to to Quincy University to visit my sister. On Sat. we left for QU. WE had fun there. We watched REMEBER THE TITaNS in my sister Maggie's dorm room. We got a hotel room. We went swiming. It was fun.. We did more than that.. I am just lazy so I don't feel like typing anymore~"

"event","Hey... I can't wait to be a dad! Well, I don't mean I want a baby anytime soon, it's just that as soon as I get married... I want one! I was babysitting my little 6 month old cousin, he was looking at me... like I was a hero when I picked him up when he was crying.. or fed him when he was hungry.. I WANT THAT! It made me feel so special. My other cousins look up to me too. They love it when I play Fireman with them. All I do is write stuff down and they love it! 

   When I have kids, I have decided that I am going to be a cool dad. I mean when you are a parent, you can't act like a kids BEST FRIEND, but I want to be a dad who plays with his kid. I mean my dad DID, but not that much. I still had a great childhood,but I would Take off work or anything for my kid. My dad would take off work only if HE HAD TOO! I would just like to sit and watch TV with my kids.. Man, I can't wait. Only about 9 more years till I graduate college.. but who know's if I will ever get married. If i didn't.. I would adopt one! That is how much I WANT Kids!"

When one's plotting to deceive...""

One expects no less.

It's... odd, really.  I know... what do I call it?... Marik's ka is inside of me, and yet... it's so strange...

Darling is still in fits... bitter about the entire situation... still threatening Mahaado about how he should have finished the job...when I am thankful that he spared Marik's life...

I had only expected for one to take my own, after what i had done.

No, Darling, I am not turning back on you... do not fret.  I still love you more than anything in the world.  I will not, however, shout and fit in Mahaado's face about what he SHOULD have done.  What's done is done.  It would be best to sit back, and let things go their course.  You, for one, are in no condition to be doing anything... and nor am I.

I suppose I'll just call him Ra...

Ra is taking up a lot of heka, so much that my powers are very limited.  In fact, due to the fact that I have not used my powers, good nor bad, in such a long time, Ra is requiring that I give him a lot of my own physical energy.  It's not too bad yet; after all I just get a bit short-winded.  I expect it to be far worse after I being... showing.

Darling, please.

Just sit back.

And make sure you ka remains okay, as well as I.  Right now, we are both essential to your survival.

Osaka is boring.  There's not a lot to do when I'm not on the set, so I just kind of go and pass out at the hotel room when I'm done.  Playing an emo-angst ridden teenager takes a lot out of you, you know.

Other than that, life is going.  Not as smooth as I'd like it do, but getting there.

...Noa being back after... all of that... certainly is a big factor in that.

<small>[Seeing Noa's name light up on my cellphone when he calls, talking to him, hearing his voice, all these things make me realize all over again why I was in love with him.  He had pulled me out from a sorry rut, and will continue to do so again and again.  I have no doubt in that.  As long as he does't leave again.  I know it wasn't his fault, even though I was so angry I blamed him forever (and I still blame Kaiba, since he refuses to talk with me) until he came back.  I just can't imagine life without him again.  It was so hard the first time he left.  Which, is why I had to break things with Seth, even though it hurt him.  But he doesn't seem to get that it also hurt me.  It's not like I didn't feel anything when I eventually broke the news to him.

I hate seeing people's faces like that, and I hate it even more when I'm the cause of it.

Thanksgiving is coming up.  I have a feeling noa will want to spend it with Kaiba and Moki, so I'm just going to have to swallow my fear/butterflies/anger amd just deal with it.  It's only one day.  Just one.  Besides, I refuse to spend it by myself in a hotel room, like I did last year.

...Not now that I have someone.  To be strong when I can't be... which, unfortunateky, since my dueling days (or at least aince after Horus and Seth took over my body... I STILL have nightmares about that shit...), I seem to have lost a lost of.]</small></lj-cut>

I'm worried, oh Ra... I've been trying to use Ramses to catch your scent, but wherever you are, it seems to have faded... he'd always follow it up to a certain point, but then stop, and when he did...

So Noa and I never went on our meeting... I ended up staying with Seth, sleeping on the couch with him, way past our meeting time.

I have to find Seth, and quickly.  I leave for Osaka soon... and I also have to find someone to watch over him while I'm away, if I can't get my manager to agree to let me take him along. (And it has to be a human, since Seth seems to dislike Ramses being his ""babysitter"".  But I have my reasons.  People aren't completely trustworthy... and Ramses is hella strong, and will protect Seth with all his might, need it be.)

"event","Well, luckily Seth is back.  Turned out Pegasus... you know, the crazed, bunny loving one... was holding him hostage, or something...

<lj-cut text=""PRIVATE"">

<small>[Okay, so... I went in, got Seth out, Mind Crushed Pegasus (I wonder if he has recovered?  Probably not... but then again, the Mind Crush I used was significantly weak compared to the one I gave Seto all those years back), and then hauled ass out of there, Seth in tow.  However...

Well, while I was taking care of him (bandaging, giving him fluids, the works... I ended up kissing him.

The first time, alright, I leaned in and then, BAM, out lips connected and we were both startled.  He was confused, I was confused... Jesus, he must have been confused...

But I had to go and make it worse by going and kissing him... AGAIN.  I don't know WHY I did it, honestly (there was no actual lust behind it--it was more like, at the time, it seemed like the right thing to do), but I did.  It was very... interesting.

I told him it wasn't because he looked like Seto.  Really, it wasn't.  After all, I had dated both Noa and the other Seto without my romantic thoughts towards them going anywhere around... him.  But I don't know WHAT to tell him.  Was I curious?  No... I really have no idea...

But I wish I could explain it--it would calm both him and I down.

I do have an odd... well, I guess maternal instinct over him.  After all, I wanted to CARRY him everywhere, and I nearly bit his head off when he wouldn't let me help him with anything or if he did something that could cause harm to him without my supervision.  I didn;t want him to get hurt.  Hell, I never want ANYONE to get hurt.

As to what to do, I have no idea.  I can;t pretend like it never happened, when indeed it did.

Also, I don't know Seth's feelings in regards to Seto.  Does he remember him at all?  The love they shared?  I am already making things too complicated.  Seth should be concentrating on his past relationship with Seto--not on me and my idiotically timed kisses!

....I don't know WHAT to do.

...And I wish I did.</lj-cut>

Yes... Seth is back.

<lj-cut text=""The Story"">

<small>I ended up finding him while out on a walk.  I had just moved into Seto's house a mere hour or so before I found him, in an alleyway surrounded by trash. <strike>He seems to have a penchant for ending up around garbage.</strike>  He was lost and confused, so, I took him back home.

He seems to have no clue as to exactly what's going on... not even the things in Egypt.  Oh, there's GOT to be SOMEWAY to get him to remember...

I got him back and got him to take a bath.  There I tried to fill him in about what he was blanking out on-- Egypt, the things here in this world--but, of course, this is a lot of informtaion to take in.  At least he is content with his own name, now.  I think Seto will do a better job in explaining these things.

I told him about Seto--he wants to meet him tomorrow.  

Anyhow, the night consisted mainly of talk, and then we decided to go to sleep.  We were originally in my bed, but I ended up moving to the couch <strike>and then Seth followed me there.  Great.  Right in full view for Seto to see, which I'm sure he did</strike>.  He seems to act like the Seth we knew... he just... forgot.

it should be easy for him to get back into the swing of things.

I'm sure Seto will be happy.</small></lj-cut>

Well you know what?  FUCK YOU.  I'll do whatever the hell I want.  I'm so fickle as to just give up on him like that!  I love him from the bottom of my heart, even though he;s said several times over he doesn;t feel the same way?

J - Junk foods you like: Doritos, Sprite and Dr. Pepper, chocolate with caramel filling~, this list could go on...

N - Number of relationships you've had: Not sure.

O - One wish you have: I wish that Seto could share the feelings I share for him, but if I got the chance to actually wish for it, I couldn't, because that would be forcing him into it.

Q - Favorite Quote: 

R - Reason to smile: Beautiful days, a job well done, Katsuya doing well in his training, seeing hikari happy, Seto.

Yes, you heard me.  I did it.  I couldn't take all the loneliness they ut me through, and all the nights spent alone while they worked, and they had each other so, basically... fuck you.  Have a nice life.  I'm sure it's better without me, since ignoring me was rather easy.

In other news (other than the fact that I'm single AGAIN, oh joy), it seems that I need to buckle down on Kat's training soon.  And Shiz, we need to go out when those casts come off.

I wish to try for him again.  I want to ask him out on a date... <i>eventually</i>. <strike>Like, maybe in a few decades or so, maybe I'll be able to crack open Mr. No-Care by then, huh?</strike>

Don't you know what's gonna happen tonight?
Nothin.
Shut up.
Don't you know
What's gonna go down in my hood?

Up high
In the sky 
All alone is where I stand...
Down low
Far below
I want to take your hand..

So what can I do tonight?
Everything's not gonna be OK...
So how can I live through the night?
Knowing tomorrow brings nothing but pain...?
It's gonna rain.

Sweet love.
Love that I can not have.
I've tried enough time to share with the world
My stories.
Sweet pain.
Pain so frighteningly dull
I'm suprised I can still feel it when let down...

Don't you know?
Even if seems, impossible.
Heros need love too?
And don't you know?
When the darkness in their mind and heart break through...?
...Well just be thankful you don't know!  So...

What can I do tonight?
Everything's not gonna be OK...

</lj-cut>

Anyhow...

There's not much to do.  I've been given a few weeks off from work.  They said they needed some time to go work with a new model for a bit, so now I've been given some liberty until about September or so.  Unfortunately, all I can really do is sit here, since Noa or Seto STILL won't call me.

Since I have such a long time off, I can finally take Shiz out like I said, and probably work with Katsuya for a bit on his breathing and pitch. <strike>And even though it sounds horrible, maybe hit a couple of bars and see if there's anyone worth exchanging numbers with.</strike>  There's not much to do anyhow, so I may as well get these things done while I can.

Maybe I should call Seto-kun and see what's up?

...Maybe.  

<strike>And if I'm lucky, maybe he'll at least answer his god damned phone and talk to me and act like I'm a human being.</strike>

<lj-cut text=""PRIVATE"">

<small>[Seriously, I probably need to take a step back and reevaluate myself.  I'm attractive, right, which is why I'm all over TV and on billboards and such things.  I mean, I know not EVERYONE is attracted to me, but being a model means I do have SOME semblance of attractiveness, correct?  I'm smart, I've clever, and I'm quick on my feet... I'm very well off and I have a great personality, so, can someone tell me exactly WHY can't I seem to keep a boyfriend? <strike>Or at least get the one I've been after for awhile?</strike> It's really something I need to think about.

Am I dong something wrong?  I mean, there's got to be SOMETHING.  I'm going to blame it on acting too clingy.  And I am, really, when I'm seeking something.  I suppose I feel as if I must attach myself to someone for them to notice me, but when I have it I'm not nearly that horrible.  After all, Noa and I then only saw each other at leisure.  But now, it seems like I don't see ANYONE.

I'm unhappy.  I'm very glad my album is almost done, because I am returning from the music buisness after that, as well as modeling.  I haven't told my bosses yet.  I want to go back to gaming.  Playing Duel Monsters, even though now it seems like odl hat.  Perhaps I'll try another game instead?  Poker, perhaps?  There are many things to do out in the world, all I have to do is find it.

However, even though this seems disturbingly fantasy-dream like, I really do wish to find love, SOMEWHERE.  I think my hearts beaten enough.  I already know I don;t like the pain.  However...

I don't like the pain of admitting defeat, either.

Or never knowing what I could find... because I didn't <i>keep trying.</i>

How many other people feel the same?

There are a lot of things I already regret.  I regret attempting to push Seto-kun into even THINKING about a possible relationship between us, even though, at the same time I don't and still long that, even though I have given up actively persuing it.  Is that giving up?  Does that count?  It seems, in such a place, I have admitted defeat.

That that mean I have lost?  Even though my heart still fights for his attention?  I haven't really though about him much.  Well, that's a lie, but I haven;t thought about him as much as I had before.  It has picked up, however, on the account of since my own boyfriends seemed to have simultaneously cut contact with me.

...Do they hate me?  Have they found all the love they needed with the other?

...Am I the third wheel?

It's true.  Only I was upset when I found out Noa and Seto had been together.  Only I was upset when they asked to be together, when they asked for my forgiveness.  And like a fool, who wanted to desperately keep what little I had, gave into it.

I suppose I knew all along it wouldn't work.  Even though I wanted it to... if just to see that I was... or could act... happy.

I hate that I was able to be so easily decieved.  Aren't I the one who manipulates minds?

Fuck it.

I won't try anymore.

I know who I love.  I love Seto Kaiba, the one who stood by me with all that dream crap, the one Pegasus and I constantly bickered over, the one I saw in my dreams, in my visions, in my thoughts.  The one I fell in love with.  I wish people would stop telling me to forget.

I don't want to.

I wish he would stop giving me that regretful look.

I don't want that, either.  I hate it.

I hate myself for loving him, and I hate myself for still trying even though I know he doesn't feel the same.

He and I are both stubborn.  Stubbornly in love, and stubbornly repellant.

I love him, and no one else.

Nothing will change that, and I won;t let it change.

So now, I make an oath to myself.

I, Atemu Niu, will close my heart forever.

And he, Seto, will forever be the only one allowed to break it.

Pain, stubborness, pride, and pure, pure, unconditional, unrequited love.  I resign myself to this fate.  I will stop trying.

Because even though around Noa I can smile, even though around the other Seto I can laugh... my heart knows the truth.  Only he can make me happy.

And if that's what I want... I'll keep what I have locked up.

If I don't...

...I might lose him not only in body, but in memory as well.]</small>

See the space in between my last entry and this one?  More than a month.  What has happened in between there?  Nothing more than Kat-chan and his boyfriend uniting, Shiz breaking her limbs, Seto-kun still in ""Anti-Mokuba"" euphoria, Ramses being the perfect pet, and Seto and Noa ignoring me.

I've memorized their answering machines, even the part where Noa fumbles at ""Leave a messager, er, message"", I've heard it so much.  The door is never opened.  Calls are never returned.  I know they're getting them.

...And I'm lonely.

I know I'm being pathetic.  I know I'm being selfish, but I want someone to be with my right now, like Kat-chan had Mado, and Ryou had Malik, and Pharaoh has Amane... they're so lucky.  Do they realize how lucky they are?

Even if they don't, they still have it.  And me, who cherished every moment with the people I cared for with all my heart, can't even seem to find a single moment now.

It hurts, a bit.  No, a lot.  I talk to my pet more than my boyfriends.

If only once, right?

...I tried for Seto.  I was told to give Noa a chance.  he seemed to like me.  He cheated on me with the OTHER Seto.  Then WE got together.  Now...

...I don't know what to do.  And if only once...

...If only once, could something go right.

...If only once, could I reach for someone's hand... they'd reach back, and not only acknowledge it, or take it, they'd pull me up and take me with them.

...Just like the man I had in my dreams over a year ago.

Life is short, and fickle, and oh so confusing.

I'm glad its easy for some.

I wish mine could be like that, too.

<small>I'm just a rollar coaster waiting to be ridden,
I try and make sure my heart is never hidden,
But--when this is true
Your heart's almost bound to be stomped upon
Whether it's on purpose
Do you think you deserve this?
No--so stop trying not to solve it!

I walk a trail of my own...
Where my heart is sure
Where my love is pure
How my feelings still grow... 
For you.
You look back and you'll see
What we had was destiny.
But damn--ha ha ha!
Obviously not!
That was shot.

It's been such a long time since I dreamt of you,
If I did again I wouldn't know just what to do
But start to cry... and I...
Never thought it'd end this way.
But what, tell me, what can I say?
Would I've had a chance
If it was yesterday...?
Ha!  I doubt it.

I walk a trail of my own...
Where my heart is sure
Where my love is pure
How my feelings still grow...

You look back and you'll see

So here I write all alone,
On paper you just can't tell the tone,
Of a voice.  But believe me--
I'm crying.  Oh...
No matter what I say or do,
My heart'll never get to you,
You'll never feel the same,
Give up, Give in
That's the song we sang
'Til the bitter end.

One more time, two more laughs
Before we go our seperate paths,
But oh wait,
I'm a little too late,
You're already half way down the road.

I move along,
To my song,
If you try to forget you can't go wrong--
TIl you cry.  One more time.
And all you see is a semblance of hope...

I walk a trail of my own...
(Where love never could live)
Where my heart is sure
Where my love is pure
How my feelings still grow... 
For you. (Make them stop...)
You look back and you'll see
What we had was destiny.
But damn--ha ha ha!
Obviously not!

However, it was the usual photoshoots and voice tests, and some INSANE amount of dance work for my new music video to the song, ""Touch That Not This"".

It's been a long night.

I went upstairs to the kitchen a couple of times to grab a snack, and every time I heard Seto inside his room, still awake.  Guess he was serious about stay up all night.

I just finished busying myself reading one of the new glossies that was out on the rack, letting one of the maids give me a manicure and pedicure.  Very nice. I'm supposed to have a photoshoot tomorrow, but maybe I'll pass on that one...

There wasn't much else to do this late at night, so I took out my old deck and began shuffling through it, wondering why there weren't anymore tournaments.  Ever.  I do rather miss it.

... When was the last time I felt my heart swell in excitement at the sight of a Blue Eyes White Dragon on the field...?

The night before was quite exhausting.  After Noa and I bickering back and forth so horribly, i thought it would never end.  I know I deserved to be yelled at, but I think Noa was too cold at times.  i couldn't help but be defensive and snap back, which, in turn, only led to more problems.  In the end... well..

I haven't spoken to her since that episode with the gods Seth and Horus and Khons and whatnot.  It was fairly rude of me, but, I really didn't know where else to go at that moment.

The ""Fight-and-More"" between Seto and I was... to say the least, utterly horrific, expecially my part in it.  I wanted to tell Isis, but, I didn't know exactly WHAT to say.  The truth would have been nice, but... I didn't want to say anything, really, so I gave her a horribly abbreviated version of it.  I'm sorry, Isis.  Perhaps you can tear it out of Seto...

<lj-cut text=""Private"">

<small>I left Isis and company early that morning, as to not disturb anyone.  More than I already have, anyway.  I didn't think I could ever get so bad.  No wonder so many stories of me being a ruthless dictator back in Egypt circulate like wildfire.  They're probably true... Ra dammit...

I'm not STUPID.  My method of getting Seto to hate me was extreme, but even though he SAYS he's not, he's so much more kind and gentle than he lets on to be.  It was too much.  But at least I've made sure he doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

<i>...How could you ever look a monster like that in the face again</i>...?

Right now, I need to concentrate on finding a house for myself.  yes, a house.  Something stable and PERMANENT.  That way, I can do... whatever I want with it!  Perhaps I'll make it in momory of my Egyptian heritage?

...What am I thinking...?

As of now, I'm looking for somewhere to stay.  Maybe I'll buy a house?

In a blink of an eye
Everything we see and know
Changes, changes
Faster than any wind

The Weather outside
Changes, changes
Much slower than the weather
In my head.
Love, hate, anger, passion
Lost in all infinity.

Cut, bleeding fingers
Brought to your pink lips
Comfort gained, gained
Every little thing done wrong
Makes a cut into your heart
Or whatever your have in there.

Sometimes I wish
That I cried blood.
For if it was so,
Every time I got hurt,
When I cried
I'd die a little faster.</small>

An act to mesmerize all who's near...
A dance to kiss away your fears...
A song to shed to a tear to all who hear...
All brought to life by the mask he wears...

I kiss your lips
I share a smile.
In the end
Your friends are worthwhile.

Through all the drama
Past all the hurt.
Stick together
We'll make it work...

I try to be <i>optimistic</i>...
To tell me ""Be realistic""...
No matter what I'm told,
I'll make it through--
Cause I told you...

I go about my life
Here's what I say:
""I've got some enemies,
But they won't have their way!""

I face the rivals,
I try and try,
I won't be beat and someday
I can soar high!

I try to be <i>optimistic</i>...
You tell me ""Hopes are sadistic""...
No matter what I'm told--

I'll seize the day!
I'll go my way
Cause life's Cliche...

---Storytime---


I'm used to it by now, really.

Life is nothing short of a game.  And for me, the King of Games, I am sorely losing it.  This is a total, one-sided beat down.  But life goes on.  Or at least, the days do.

If you ask someone the definition of life, you will get different answers.  The time span in which you live.  The events that take place within that time span.  Some will give you an answer filled and dutifully crafted with woven, whimsical words that fill the page with an artistic flair.  Others will slowly recall things that make there life what is it today, full with subtle shyness and a soft, gentle voice that shall only reach the ears of those who care to hear it.

For me, however, the answer is short, blunt, and to the point.  To the point, where, it makes <i>some</i> people uncomfortable.

Life is nothing with Seto Kaiba.

Here's the deal, however.  How many more times must I weave the same words over and over again?  How many times must I slowly say them, hoping not to scare him off, or spirit him away, due to words alone?  How about this: Seto Kaiba, you really piss me off.  One, stop <i>fucking around</i> with people who hate you and your company, you fucking masochist.  Two, don't tell me you don't want to look for love when you pine after Seth.  You're a Ra-damned <i>hypocrite</i>.  Three...

...I don't even know anymore.  There's a lot inside of me... so much anger and love and hate and excitement and fury... so much emotion... I just... I'm going to <i>burst</i>.  What do I do with it all?

...Why does it all have to center around <i>HIM</i>?

I've tried to find someone else.  I really have.  I tried here in Domino, I've tried other actors and dingers and models like myself, tried the people in the foriegn lands I visited the months I was gone... I tried and tired, letting them get close enough to see me, but not enough to get a chance further than a kiss.  Not until i could rid myself of that... that <i>man</i> that I am so desperately, hopelessly in love with. 

And I hate it.  I hate that I can't do anything to stop it, hate myself for making him feel how he does now.

Am I so worthless?

I know he cares for me, and I care for him, but it's different, it's not the same kind, or the same way, and I can never, <i>ever</i> hope to get him to feel the way that I do.  He told me it won't happen, and what Seto Kaiba says won't happen, <i>WON'T</i> happen.

But I'm still here anyway.  Still desperately clinging and hoping, because that's all I have left.  If I let go, then what will I have?

Nothing.  Not even that sad, <i>pitiful</i>, <b><i>pathetic</i></b> little hope for change.

I'm weak.  I'm pathetic.  I'm clingy.  I'm hopeful, foolish, idiotic, moronic, pleading, deperate, and most of all, the thing I hate the most...

<i>Like a bad star, I'm falling.</i>

What can I do?  What can I say?

Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Just like my hopes, my dreams, my heart...

And my future.

I am absolutely nothing.

And if that's all I ever get for giving my heart and soul and entire being to loving him, that intelligent, <i>beautiful</i>, mind-defying man, you know what?

...So be it. </lj-cut>



Anyhow, I'd better find something to do.  It's getting boring just laying here.

"event","Well, now that I'm back in my own original body, everything is... sort of back to normal.  It was a bit fun messing with Mokuba as I threatened the peace of Moki's body, but I never planned to do anything to it.  But it was still fun.

I'm still living in one of the guest rooms in Seto's house.  Mokuba asked if I would be an MmmK model for him.  It does sound like fun.  It also gives me something else to do than lay around like a lifeless lump.

<small>But then again, maybe that's all I am, now.</small>

I walk by Seto's room sometimes and hear him typing.  It's a rather peaceful sound.

<small>I've also been reading up and hearing about how well Mokuba and Moki or Malik and Ryou are doing.  Why are THEY so lucky?</small>

I really need something to do. <small>And someone to hold on to.  I think I'm beginning to suffer withdrawls.  Even thought Kaiba didn't care for me that much, at least he let he snuggle with him...</small>Everything seems to be just falling apart again.

....Ah well.

...Not as if there was anything held together to begin with.

I was thinking about how to solve it, but then I mentally berated myself.

<small>Curse my want to keep the promise we made each other so long ago, Seto...</small>

"event","So I get turned down <strike>by yet another Kaiba</strike> again, and end up running to Seto. <strike>You know.  The one that I liked to begin with and still do and tried to forget through means of the other?</strike>  I was soaking wet upon entering his house, and crying and everything else completely unattractive (unless one has a superhero complex).  

However, as per usual, the kind Seto managed to show his soft side and allow me to stay with him.

As usual.

That sounds pathetic.  And it is.

Just like me.

I went to bed, completely devistated... only to wake up and fine out that I had shrunk.  I mean, I knew Kaiba's PJs were large on me, but this was ridiculous.  However, I noticed that my hair had grown longer--much longer--and was now to my knees and dark, dark black.  I scrambled to a mirror, noticing my even MORE apparent lack in height, and took a look in.

....Holy crap.

...I was Mokuba.

And not the Mokuba who's obessed with dressing up his brother and getting off as much as he can each day.  Oh no.  The latter.  The kinder, smiling, nicer version of the little one we all came to know.

Moki.


I was... in MOKI'S body.

...Well.

This will be interesting.

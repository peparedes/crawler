"event","for the past two days, the majority of my hours have been spent secluded in my room, sitting on my bed, with my nose buried in harry potter and the deathly hallows. 
kelly and i got the book on friday night. i was number 358 in line.
i finally finished yesterday morning, around 3 A.M.
tears were all over the place. of course i cried. i just had to.
<i>it was nothing short of amazing.</i>

JK Rowling...........is a true genius.





i've decided that i freaking love my life!
i was looking through some old pictures and they made me so happy.
i don't really know why, because i've seen them all a hundred times before. 
but they did. 


i'm going to the beach on saturday for a week! i'm so excited!

it's just that when i come home, ben will be leaving the next morning.
and when he comes home, it will almost be the end of summer :(
it's been good though.

maybe the best in a while."

life rocks.

ben came home after 4 days of being in new york.
he wasn't feeling well and was not comfortable being up there for three weeks.
so he came back. and he's staying.
:D!


and then on tuesday night at midnight....
I SAW HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX AND IT WAS SO AMAZING.
and next friday...we're getting the book right away. 
midnight party at barnes and noble! yaayayyayayyyy!
i'll be up all night reading probably.

"event","is it considered selfish to be depressed that my birthday was sabotaged by the works of a higher power?
is it selfish to even consider downpours of rain and hail as sabotaging?


i don't know why i'm so worried about being selfish lately, i guess it's my mom finally getting to me. she tells my sister and i all the time that we only care about ourselves. i'm hoping it's not true.

today was my seventeenth birthday.
I GOT A CAR. hello 8:30 a.m. tears-of-joy fest.
i love it. a whole lot.

if i had to describe my day in one word, it would probably have to be blurry.
it's kind of always how my birthdays have been. 
there always seems to be so much more going on that i usually forget that it's my birthday. i'm not sure if i like that or not.

of course my day was great, for the most part, but the whole rain and tornado watch thing.......nope. not good. not good at all. 
the fireworks had to be cancelled. they're my absolute favorite part every year. 
it sucked. 
and yeahh, they are rescheduled for saturday night, but saturday is after ben leaves for new york, and i'm probably going to be semi-depressed.

and that brings me back to the guilt trip i've been on all day.
it's my birthday, I GOT A FREAKING CAR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. 
i still can't believe that it's alllll mine, but i feel like i should quit whining and complaining about everything else, because well...it is! 

i suppose my expectations are too high.
<i>it's just a birthday.</i>

but something just doesn't feel right. it's missing. and i don't know what.

i can't blame it on anybody...oh god i could never do that...everyone was so great today and they all made me smile and i had a lot of fun but i still can't help feeling kind of sad. 

i duno.
i'm a year older. 
and here i am once again at the end of my birthday, taking in everything that happened, and i just wonder if this is really all it is.
in exactly one year from today, i will be eighteen.
it will be my first day of being eighteen, just like today is my first day ever of being seventeen. just like last year was my first day ever being sixteen. weird, if you want to call it that i guess.


ben's parents gave me a birthday present.
how cute is that.

and ben...gave me flowers today. the first time i ever got flowers from a boy. i was rather excited. 

do you ever wonder if people just say they love you because it's what they're ""supposed"" to do?
like parents. okay they say they love me (and i'm pretty sure they do), but what if they really didn't?
would they say it anyway? how can you be a parent and not tell your kids you love 'em? it's just wrong. but i mean, what if they seriously didn't? i just wonder that if by some crazy chance it was a lie they would tell it to me anyway.

whyyy do i get such weird moods.
why.

i can't explain it on here, let alone to myself. 
so i won't try.


god i'm going to miss ben so much. FIVE WEEKS PEOPLE. 
he got out of mallory's car tonight, and it was all i could do to stop myself from jumping out after him. he's not even leaving until after tomorrow. but he leaves and i want to go right after him. it's how it always is.

six minutes until my birthday is finito.
nice knowing you, sixteen.
but i'm ready for bigger and better things.
so seventeen, bring it on."

i don't know what i was going to say.


but anyways, today was just weird.
the next few weeks are going to be weird.
my birthday is next wednesday (the 4th), and i'll be seventeen.

ben is going to ocean city this weekend. he just told me tonight. and i'm not okay. because he leaves on friday, comes home tuesday, and then leaves two days later for <b>3 whole weeks</b>. so i'll see him on my birthday, and then maybe the day after that. even worse is that when he comes home on the 27th, i leave the very next day for ocean city. it gets better. we come back on the 4th of august, and he leaves on the 5th for the very same place that i will have just left. 
my mother denied the idea of him coming down to the beach with us.

i couldn't even talk to him earlier without getting choked up.
maybe i'm just being a loser but whatev. 
it's five freaking weeks and i can't imagine how rough it's going to be.

by the time things are normal again summer will be almost over.
sometimes i want to know why things can't just be easy for once. just once.

i just sneezed.

   thank you so very much for scheduling me to work on the first night of summer vacation.
not to mention the 6 hour shift on my last day. i'll be really happy to be there. it should be nice to leave with such good memories of baskin robbins, and the ever-so-friendly customers that come in to get loads of ice cream at a time. i'm assuming we will have a line out the door that day, but i won't mind. don't be fooled if i look like i want to scream...i'll just be trying to contain my eagerness to work my butt off.
   thanks again for always finding a way to turn my day around.
farewell, 
   scooping sam.




so tonight wasn't THAT bad.
ben surprised me and came in to work. it was so cute.
i won't see him tomorrow even though it's our ""month-aversarry"" (he said it; not me...gaybutt) haha. he's going to hershey park. did i already say this? i don' think so. i hope not. HE'S SO LUCKYYYY i love hershey park.
the great bear is where it's at. ahhhhh!

i remember going to hershey park in the fall when we had first met furbee and everyone. me and kel came up with a plan to freak them out.
we told furbee that kelly hit her foot on a rollercoaster and was being rushed to the hospital. he totally believed us. and he wanted to kill us when he found out that we were joking. so funny, so funny.

not because...it's supposed to be that way?

i don't really know what i'm getting at.
and i guess that i shouldn't really try to explain it, either. 
because, well.....i just am not very good at that.
it makes sense in my head though.


i think it's kind of weird that i'm using this thing as practically a diary now.
...posting my business on the web for anyone to access...
it's kind of creepy, right?

..maybe it makes me look like i have no life?

well whatever.

ben and i matched at school today.
it was by complete coincidence.
i thought it was the funniest thing ever (being the overdramatic person that i am) but ben just felt ""gay.""
paahaha. 
if you ask me, i say we looked cute. i think it's perdy cool how we both ended up wearing hot pink shirts.
(aaaahah and now you probably <i>do</i> think he's gay.)


ohh how that boy makes me smile.


tomorrow is mallory's birthday!!!!
she's going to be seventeen. we went to uno's tonight for dinner and it was a lot of fun. we haven't hung out super six-wise in forever. and i mean <b>forever</b>. it was nice.

i'm starting to think that paranoia should be my middle name.
and that makes me sad.
because it's the truth.

but it's just because i don't want right now to go away.
i love it too much.

(i'm trying not to fall in to my freakout stage where i freeze up at everything and just end up making things worse)

summer is in one week from today.
it's one of those times where i want to go forward with my life SO bad but i'm scared of leaving things behind and then can't let go.
i seem to have those times a lot.

it would be nice if summer just came..and then never left. only because i do and don't want to be a senior. 
(mostly don't) 
i have so much crap that i have to do before the end of next week. some of it deals with big decisions that i'm not ready to make...

on a happier note, my last day at baskin robbins will be next saturday.
i'm going to miss some of the people that are there, but i sure as hell won't miss customers asking me to make five billion large chocolate fudge milkshakes. or even one for that matter. 
the things that i will miss are silly. i'll miss sneaking ice cream behind bill's back (mmmmm pralines and cream). i'll miss having the leftovers of people's drinks. i'll miss wearing my visor. i'll miss thinking how gross it is from watching people come in to get ice cream that they really don't need. i'll miss working with kelly. i'll miss goofing off with angie. i'll miss making fun of bill for calling himself the president (haha). 
so you see, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling. that's how it always is with me.
but i'm still ready to move on.

well it's late, and seeing that i couldn't even keep my eyes open for ten whole minutes earlier, i think i should get to bed."

today was wonderful.
and it was raining.

we got our puppy.
she's insanely hyper, and insanely cute.
one happy little fluffball of life.
she likes to be cold. 
on the way home, she was laying up against the AC vent in the car. and her new favorite thing to do is lay flat on her stomach on the laundry room floor, which is always cold.
we are still calling her ""puppy"" right now. 

i worked today for about 2 and a half hours [i was late because we drove all the way from cumberland (after getting the puppyyyyy!!) and got stuck in traffic]. i cannot wait to get out of baskin robbins. it's exciting.


ben came over for a while after work :)
so of course that was fun.
we just hung out with puppyyy and my fam downstairs most of the time. 
he brought me a present though. it was pretty much the cutest thing anyone's ever done for me, in a weird kind of way. haha<3
oh and then he busted my foot open trying to pick me up and throw me in to the pool.
i hit a rock while struggling to break free of his grasp.
it actually hurt pretty bad.

tomorrow is monday and it marks the beginning of the second to last week until summer break. we've got five days this week, five days next week, and then i will officially be a Class of 2008 Senior.

good golly.

ben and i are almost at our one month. hahaha.
june 10th!
it feels so much longer than that though.

summer is in eleven school days.

the beach with furb and kelly is in about...17 days (that's including the weekends).

everything i've been waiting for is so close now and it feels more than good.
if you'd have asked me this past fall to predict where my life would be now...i never would have guessed that i'd be where i am. it's just interesting.


did i mention that i took the SATs today?
i don't think i did.
i took the SATs today.
and some of the questions were ridiculously worthless. 
i'm kind of...excited to see my scores.
i'm kind of excited for life.


and just for the record, i know i said i was never going back to stupid relationships with boys, and you can smack me for being a total hypocrite, but what the heck. i've found this amazing guy who treats me like i'm an amazing person, and i'm happy. and that's honestly all i care about."

so today.
numerous things occured.
1-i actually finished an english essay for once, and then...omgosh...turned it in! woop woop.

3-I GOT MY FRICKINGDLIKHOIFGHOIHDOIHIGHOIN <b>LICENSE</b>@!!!*!*)!&&!)(*!)(&
SO wonderful. 
it wasn't raining, i didn't knock over a cone, and i stopped where i was supposed to. sweet life. 
i got home and went to kelly's. for the whole two minutes that i was driving to her house, i was freaking out..due to something that i say reaaally should be made an official medical condition. 
<b>new driver's syndrome.</b> 
symptoms include: loud music, the occasional squeal of excitement, the rolling down of windows, and the overpowering feeling of 100% freedom.
<i>i can go anywhere i want to now.</i> and when i actually have a car of my own....oh boy. it will not be good news. i'm going to be all over the place.
 
after visiting my baby, i went to see furb and timothy at work down the street. 
and then i made my way over to ben's. 
i didn't get lost, and i didn't parallel park infront of his house like a total retard. 
i like his house. i like his dog. i like his dad. i like him!
we had oranges on the sofa and watched (or maybe didn't watch..) meet the fockers.
he's suuuuuuuch a cutie.

after getting lost in a maze of one-way streets, i drove home, had dinner, and went out to the gym with kel, mal, and buff. sweeeeet. 
then drove home (in the dark...for the first time...eeeee!) and went to dinner at olive garden with my girls. it was a lot of fun. and kelly got hit on by our black waiter. dayummmm.

tomorrow's going to be lame. i've got work 12-6, and then who knows what my life will consist of after that. i'm so ready for summer. 


the seniors don't have to come back anymore. and that means that i am now a senior in high school. after this year, there is no more. what am i going to do with myself?


i remember 4th grade recess when all us girls would run around the tennis courts picking up the caterpillars so the boys wouldn't be mean and smush them.

i've got problems.

i just lost my cell phone for the third time in about a month. i don't think i'm going to be lucky enough to find it this time.
this guy has suddenly returned to my life; making things more complicated than they were before.
i 'm torn between going with my heart, or listening my brain. 
i feel worthless.
i yell at my mom when she wakes me up in the morning without even realizing what i am doing. 

and i'm starting to not give a shit about some stuff. i don't know if this is bad or good.

i'm not happy like i used to be.

i wish i could get back to that place where i was excited.

but most of all, i just wish that i knew why all of this stuff is bothering me so much. i've been sad and mean lately. and i don't like it."

haha i know it's random. but it was on hellogoodbye's myspace. and i really liked it.

it's march today :)
i am SO unbelievably and insanely excited for what's coming up soon. spring, prom, summer...oh my gosh.
right now my main desire is to wear flip flops. oh god, that day will be truly amazing.
i just feel really excited and happy about life right now. i'm so tired of not living. i wanna get out there and just have fun and be CRAZY(er) and not care about anything but the moment. i hope this summer is fantastic. i'll probably have my lisence (let's hope) by early summer, which is going to be absolutely fantabulous. i can't wait. i want to do everything. i want to feel adventure. i wanna feel a rush of adrenaline. i want to feel love. i want to feel freedom. i just want to feel aliiiive.  

but it's not like i don't feel alive with things how they are now. because i honestly can't complain about my life at the moment, which is an incredible feeling. i'm happy, and from here on out, things are only looking up. i just hope they stay that way. i feel like i'm at such an important time during my life right now, which is scary but weirdly thrilling at the same time. i mean, these are the times that i'm going to remember when i have kids and tell them stories about growing up, right? hanging out with the boys, being loud, being completely retarded, going crazy with my best friend and us being the only ones who knew what was going on, getting lost on roadtrips, staying up super late just to be able to talk to someone...it's crazy. i guess i'm just starting to realize that this is the time i'm going to think about when reflect on how i became who i am. 

i just feel so motivated to live all of a sudden. mr. owings, who is my second period american lit. teacher, told us this thing yesterday that most people spend like 1/3 of their lives asleep, and if you live to be about 73 or so, only about 50 waking years are left. it kind of depressed me. i don't want to waste time anymore.

lately i've drifted from alot of people. i'm sad that it's happening, but i do believe that it's happening for a reason. i feel it in my heart to just let things go how they will, and then we'll see where i end up. the main crew as of now consists of kyle, furbee, me, and kelly...we have alot of fun together. 
kelly's kind of branching off back to old friends which is perfectly fine but i do kind of miss her sometimes. but i know she'll ALWAYS be my soul sister. always<####. 
furb and me can be kind of insane sometimes. he talks about anything and everything (except tampons) and gets me riled up for some reason. he makes me be loud. he's one of the best guy friends i've ever had.
and then there's kyle. kyle makes me smile. alot. alot alot. he's hilarious. he's the one that proves me wrong (he finds a way to prove everyone wrong) but still amazes me at the same time. nothing's official right now. but i feel comfortable around him. i can be me. now of course i get the butterflies alllll the time when i'm near him, but i think i'd be worried if i didn't. kyle is a goofball. he makes me laugh and it's safe to say that things just feel like they should. we're slowly getting there. 

i really hope the rest of the super six knows that they will always be my friends, no matter what happens. we've all been together for so many years and made so many memories together that i could never ever ever forget about them. they're insane and i love them all more than they know. 

you know, i'm not really even sure if anyone reads this anymore. i don't know if they ever really did. but i love writing, and the thought of not knowing who's reading and who's not kind of excites me. i could be spilling my guts to the world (doubtful) or nobody (likely), but who knows. who cares. cool, right?

i feel so relaxed and mellow right now. tomorrow's friday. i love the weekends.
it rained tonight and i had the biggest urge to go run in it, but i wasn't going to do it alone. so i didn't. maybe it will rain again tomorrow night. 

god i'm so excited.

no school, so i slept until about 12 :)
then sat around did basically nothing until workkk at 3.
wasn't so bad. some new girl was there training, hah that was me like 3 weeks ago. i felt smart because she asked me for help
angie was there, i love working with her she's so easy to talk to. and she doesn't care if i screw up, which i do.
i had to watch some lame video about packing because i can't do it right and cheat baskin robbins out of money. woops. 
then kelly came in at 5 to work but bill let me go home like 45 minutes early so i didn't get to work with her.

valentine's day is pointless. it's so stupid to have a day dedicated to showing affection for whoever. and i'm not just saying that as a result of not having a valentine, because i do, but i don't think it's worth it. whatever. 
maybe i'm just bitter because i didn't get to do anything with him today.

god i hate headaches. i've had one for almost a whole day now.
i'm gonna go eat some cookies. hopefully there's no school tomorrow. it's pretty bad out there.
like an ice jungle or something."

"event","have you ever thought about how miniscule and insignificant your life is to the rest of the world?
like seriously.
this has been coming back to me the past few days.
just think about how you have your friends and your little life routine, and it's all you know.
out there is someone doing the exact same thing that you do; hanging out with their friends on the weekends, driving around aimlessy in cars, singing at the top of their lungs flying down the highway, getting a job, whatever.
it's just really weird to think about it.
like someone on the complete other side of the continent might be doing what you're doing at any given moment. i could think about it forever. 
and i wonder if there's someone out there who looks like me? there has to be. there just has to. everyone has to look like someone. it's a little creepy but insanely fascinating.

and another thing.
you think you know someone. but when you reaaaally think about it, there's no way in hell you do. 
there's so many things that people don't know about me, like what i do when i'm alone...my little quirks and stuff like that. nobody's ever going to know unless i tell them. i could keep a whole can of secrets from the world.
i won't, but i could.
this kind of stuff really gets you thinking. it makes you wonder what goes on in other people's minds. their mind is all they know, too. you wonder what people think about you. and what if you're looking at the exact same object but see something entirely different? like colors! what if your red is not the same as another person's?
god i'm getting too carried away with this. i have homework.

today was nice.
school-saw a fight. developed pictures :). report cards.
work-learned how to close. paycheck. lots of tips. woopwoop.
now it's time for homework. and shower and other crap.
tomorrow's friday :D"

"event","okay so today was amazing, to say the least.

woke up this morning after my really weird titanic dream...who knows where that one came from...but it was SO nice outside and i was in such a good mood and it was just really nice.
hmmm i ate breakfast, showered, did some stuff, and then went out with kyle and furb so they could get pit beef sandwiches haha.
i got fries with gravy. :)
then we went to take a sandwich to kelly at work and talked to her while she was on break then went back to furb's house and hung out in his backyard for like an hour. haha OH MY GOD there was this dog at his neighbor's house that was outside scooting around on it's two front paws and it's butt and it was just about the funniest thing i have EVER seen. i was laughing so hard i almost fell of the bench. thennnnn we went on a hike in the woods, i just about killed myself trying to keep up with them, i was definately NOT wearing the proper shoes for that kind of activity. lol kyle basically tried to demolish me; he tossed a rock at me and since i was holding my phone i didn't catch it right so it hit my finger right below the nail and it started bleeding and it wouldn't stop for the longest time and it was a real big problem. then he started shaking this dead tree while i was walking under it and the branches started falling all over the place...that boy never ceases to shock me.
we got back to furb's and he got into this hilarious argument with his mom about having to shower before he went to dinner or whatever, then me and kyle left and drove around for like 45 minutes until we had to pick kelly up from workkk. 
after that we went back to her house and went on the TRAMPOLINE! god i love that thing. then we went inside, her parents came home, and we had cereal! then kelly smelled a candle and got black stuff all over her face. HAHA. shortly after that we left kel's house to go see andychangchaaang and ended up meeting him at relay elementary playground, after we got lost for about 15 minutes. ohhh what a place that is. kelly and andy were talking on the bench while kyle and i layed on the slides for seriously like, an hour just looking at the stars and the clouds.
i was freezing cold but it was wonderous. then furbee came and we sorta just walked around until him and kyle decided to drive through the baseball feild in furb's truck. after that we left and went to furbee's house and went walking in the woods again! only this time it was dark. i still wasn't wearing the right shoes, but furb let me wear his big warm jacket so i didn't have to be freezing anymore. we walked down this crazy intense hill with rocks and wet leaves and practically nothing to hold on to if you started to fall and i was kind of taking forever to get down but kyle stayed behind and helped me which was really nice :)
then we got to the bottom of the hill and walked across the dam which pretty much scared the shit out of me because on either side was a dark pool of rushing water and it was kiiinda in the middle of nowhere. 
the hike back up was not at all what i expected. it wasn't even that hard. we did it in like 5 minutes tops, with a few slips here and there. then kyle and furbee sprinted off leaving kelly and me abandoned in the middle of the pitch black woods. but we had flashlights. when we got to the end of the trail they jumped out and scared us. it was totally predictable. haha back at furb's house was craaazy we just sat around and talked in his backyard about who knows what. then kelly and me got really cold so we took furbee's jacket and huddled inside of it and started doing these really random things. haha we are sooo cool. we could NOT stop laughing to save our lives. she was making the weirdest noises and she sounded like a bird and i was doing weird stuff that made her laugh too and we were cracking up harder than ever and it was amazing!
furbee and kyle thought we were complete retards, but it wasn't worth explaining it to them. only her and me could understand it, that's for sure. i love that girl so much. she is like my other half. 

i love days like this.
goodnight:)"

so it's been over a year...
and i suddenly just got the urge to write in this
i also added a new layout and picture.

lots of stuff has happened.
halfway through junior year now, and christmas in TWELVE DAYS which i can NOT wait for :D
i really hope it snows. 
temps have been insanely warm; today it got up to about 55 or so, 
which is completely unacceptable for this time of year don't you think?

i really wish i had something interesting to write about...
because i'm in the writing mood.
i love writing.
but i also love sleeping, and i think i'm gonna go to bed soon
but idk. 
i still have to do my spanish homework...ughh i'm so tired of school.
today i was getting pissed of at the littlest things
like my history teacher, we had a test and he gave us an essay which he DID NOT tell us about(he said the test was going to be very easy and mostly short answer so i was like okay yeah, i got this) and mine totally sucked but whatever.

maybe i'll read.
and put off my spanish homework until lunch tomorrow. haha
i just hate doing homework. alot.
i have so much other stuff that i would rather do and homework just ruins it

bleh. okay...well enough of my complaining i guess..
i've got some stuff to do.
goodnight"

so its saturday...yesterday school was not that bad except i couldnt remember it was friday
and then after school i had a doctors appointment and the wait took forever and a year and then i saw the doctor for like 5 minutes. he wasted my time

then we got in the car and i saw that courtizzle called me so i called her back and she asked if i wanted to walk to opies!! opies means summer is on its way<333 so i met mal and courtney and then we waited for megan which took a while and then we started our walk =). it was kind of chilly out but we got snowballs anyway! mmm i got strawberry with marshmallow on top and then we sat and talked and then walked around and did not see anyone we knew. thennnnn we went back to mal's house and goofed around like we always do but it was a blast. and since we were home alone we made dinner and had an indoor picnic!! we made so much food lol but we didnt burn the house down so that was good. and we watched harry potter and listened to music(b a n a n a s!)and then courtney left and then mr.willard haha and ms.kathy came home and we watched this thing on vh1 about lindsay lohan and then we went home. 

i have nothing to do today and i really dont want to do homework so tell me if you want to do something!!"

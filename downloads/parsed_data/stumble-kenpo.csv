What's with the sudden affection? Whoever, the guy who said everyone' making out in the streets? Totally right. It's kinda gross, really.

They're so distracted. They don't <i>notice</i> anything else.

Instead, I curled up by a fire at Roy's house. It was warm and toasty, so I took a nap. I can't help it - warm places make me sleepy. 

I wish there was a way for there to be snow that didn't melt in warm weather. But that's sorta completely impossible. On the other hand, isn't everything about this city? >3

By the way~ Ikki~ When's the tournament? I've been practicing this AT stuff and it's just too cool. &hearts;"

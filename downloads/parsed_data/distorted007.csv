"event","I need something like a social life.

I have thrown it all away, and the outcome is less than pleasurable from my viewpoint.  In contrast to who I was before, I have not only thrown away friendships, but probably created a persona that is not what I want others to perceive.

Rather, the long hours at work and the responsibility has thrown me into this ""stand still"" of being not a career woman, and not a good friend.  I am a loner.  I come home to Tyler and  Yahtzee, and even at times, that does not make me happy.  What more can I ask for?  It is too easy for me to be one emotion one second, and then a split second later, a totally different person.

Chemical imbalance?  Sure, why not.  I have stopped myself on more than one occasion utilizing those happy pills my PCP has prescribed to me.  Why should I?  Should I become like the rest of mainstream America and pop a pill to become happy?  AT times like this, it seems the easy way out.  I have talked to those who have finally started taking anti-depressants...besides the awful side effect of losing your libido (and folks, let's face it.  Losing my libido at the age of 26 is NOT a happy forecast) it seems to have given a certain someone a life-lift.  It's amazing the turnaround I have seen in the past months and ""i want to go to there.""  I'm getting bored of my life once again.  
While i'm still not done with a BS, at least i am less than six months away from achieving that milestone in my life but what then?  What happens after that?  Something is going to miraculously make me happier because of that?

I hate opening up my feelings and expressing them, but it seemed to work back in the day when I wrote in this thing...I guess i'm afraid someone will read every single entry and try to psychoanalyze me.  Sure, I would love for you to do that, as long as you were a certified professional with plenty of experience.  If not, then please, all I want is a friend.

I find myself associating more with older women than women my age.  Why is this?  Probably because I feel as though my phase of my life is the awkward stage.  THe one where you know you are getting older but unfortunately cannot get to the next step of creating a family because...well...i won't go there at this time.

WHAT DO I WANT OUT OF LIFE?!?!?

I think i am so ready to move onto the next step of my adult life that i am failing to see the beauty in what i have to date.  Among that, there are other personal scenarios in my life at this moment that are hindering me from feeling certain things.

In any case, i'm in the dumps at the moment, that is not hard to tell.  If only I could fully express how and what i feel to others in a manner that is non-judgmental...alas...that will not happen anytime soon.  That takes effort from both parties, none of which exist at this very moment.


The question as asked to me recently...""What is that ONE thing that you do not tolerate?""

I couldn't answer.  Her reply was ""I do not tolerate people talking down to me, not even if Jesus himself were on the street and spoke down to me,  I would not tolerate it.""

...okay......

I think i put up with things...no matter what, and I think i know why.  I over analyze.  ""Sure, that person just gave me the evil eye...maybe she is having a bad day...or maybe she wasn't looking at ME.""

Is this denial or forgiveness?  I can put up with a lot of things until they pile up onto one another...that's when the trouble starts.

Until then, the thought of utilizing exercise into my life sounds like a great stress reliever..but then i over-think that too.  'What times is it?  oh man, the office people are at the clubhouse, and there are no blinds in the gym....i don't want them staring at me...""

Yes, i have issues, problems and diversions that stop me from doing what I really want to do.

Any advice?"

"event","Well, I've decided that i'm going to take a couple of semester off of school.  I haven't indulged this information with any of my parents yet, but they will know soon enough.

I have been going to school non-stop since i've been a senior in high school.  I know many students do this, but i just can't seem to move anywhere...

I'm seriously thinking about changing my major, too....I just can't imagine myself becoming a nurse...

"event","Well, none of you know (at least, i don't think you know) that I have not been on speaking terms with my Mother for more than a month.  Well, ever since Jeni's wedding (sometime in Sept..LIke Sept 6 or 7th), that is...and i'm pretty sure that has been well over a month by now.  The reason being something totally stupid and childish, but none the less, it has been bothering the HELL out of me.

I don't have the best relationship with my Mother.  There are so many unsaid things that need to be said about her reactions to things, her views, and how she handles them.  I have yet to say any of it to her because I can't.  I can't seem to tell her that she has flaws, like me and anyone else.

So anyway, it's been bothering me.  1/2 of me wants to pick up a phone and call her, to tell her hi, how's it going, but the other 1/2 just wants to be stubborn and say 'you didn't do anything wrong, why are you picking up the phone?'  And the reason i haven't is because i think she wants an apology from me, but I don't owe her one.  I didn't do anything wrong.

Also, i know if i call her now, she will rant and rave as to why i hadn't called sooner.  Or worse, she'll just hang up on me like she did the last 2 times i called when it all started.  I hate being hung up on, especially by someone i care deeply about.

So anyway...I called her today.  She didn't answer her cell phone... i can't remember if it rang enough times for voicemail to be picked up...I take that back...If someone calls and my Mom doesn't want to talk, she'll just let it ring...I left a message, told her it was me, and I wanted to know how she was doing...and that the whole deal with us not talking to one another was bothering me (which it is, to the point that i think about it everyday, and try to stuff it to the back of my head).  I told her i Loved her and that i Missed her.

That was it...

I was shaking, i didn't think the words were going to come out of my mouth.  I asked her to please call me.  I don't know if she will, but at least i'll know in my mind that i did call her.

The holidays are coming up, and i couldn't just keep on ignoring the problem.

I even sent her a card a couple of weeks ago, telling her that i didn't mean to hurt her...and asked her to call me, but she didn't.

So only time will tell now if she wants to talk to me or not...I know she's going through a hard time right now, especially with the whole Abbi ordeal...And i want to be there for her.

Mom, I love you."

"event","So...what's been going on with moi?!   Well, considering the fact that i don't remember the last time i've updated in this thing...I don't know where to start.

school.

School has been okay.  I missed my first class for the whole semester this past tuesday, because i didn't leave work until a quarter past 5 in the morning, didn't get home till a little after 6, and i DID NOT want to get up at 830 to get ready for class. 

NOTE TO SELF: get that problem fixed.

I figure if i sleep all day Monday, i can stay up for my class...But then again, i'd be in class until 2pm Tuesday, so i don't think that's a good idea either.  I could talk to managment and tell them i can't leave past 330-4ish that morning so i can at least have SOME sleep....But i don't know.  

I'm really beginning to hate my job, but only on Mondays.  We had 2 call outs in less than 1 minute.  I wasn't too happy about that, b/c Mondays' suck ass anyway...ugh.

Relationship:

My relationship with pretty much anyone is alright, i guess.  I haven't pissed anyone off lately (good) and i've also not gotten into any big fights w/ anyone lately (good).

Car:

I have reached 130,000 miles on my car since yesterday.  STILL haven't changed my timing belt....I'll get to that soon enough, though...(Once i have the 700 dollars to put down on it).

Feet:

My feet KILL me.  Yesterday, i volunteered to help out with the Easter Seals in Nashville.  THE KIDS WERE ADORABLE!!!!!  Unfortunately, i had to wear black pants/shoes and the only shoes i have that are black and closed toed are not for wearing around more than a couple of hours, especially while walking around with kids and playing with them!  Nonetheless, i had fun.

Head:

I still have this persistant aching in my head.  It's not a full-blown headache, but if i move my eyeballs around the center of my head hurts.  Also, if i sneeze or cough, it hurts like hell.  I've taken decongestants, allergy pills, and headache medicine (all at different times to see which one would heal it) and none of them do.  this will be day 4 of this pain.



Well, i'd love to write more, but i have to get ready for class, since i've already missed it once this week.  I hope everyone is doing well in class. ;)"

Please keep the 2 of them as well as the families in your thoughts and prayers.  My worst fear is that she continues to keep on driving on the terrible roads and ends up having an accident...

I'm trying to be optimistical about this, and not be pessimistic, but its very hard.

It scares me...She just recently turned 16 and does not have a lot of driving experience under her belt, much less experience in the road conditions Louisiana has right now.

*yikes*  That was kinda....scary.....



ANYWHO...Lately, i have been in 'drone mode'.  Meaning, I've been going through the daily tasks of my life without really knowing that i'm doing it.  No feelings.  No gratitude.

School starts this monday (29th).  i'm not really too excited about it.  Sure, i spent 140 bucks on a 1 credit hour class for books, but hey!  I don't care....

It seems, anytime i want to talk to a family member of mine, they are STILL too busy to talk to me.  I feel like such a loser, and my thumb is sore after dialing everyones house phone, cell phone, work phone...I finally got to talk to Annie...and she was in a sour pissy ass mood, so i ended the phone call rather quickly.  Abbi is too busy driving, my Mom is working with her customers, and my  Dad doesn't answer ANY of his phones.  (Ben is always somewhere else....smart guy).

Sometimes i wonder what my life would be like if i didn't move to Tennessee...
If i still lived in Depressing Madison, Alabama.
I'd probably end up becoming a huge drug addict with no friends.

...Or maybe, i'd have been done with school sooner, and working at a REAL job....

Who knows.  This is the hand of cards God dealt me.  I guess i'm just going to have to deal with it.


On relationship news---Justin and i aren't doing too well.  I mean, i've grown f-a-r-t-h-e-r away from him than ever.  I guess putting up with his extracurricular activites has left him to not 'be there' for me...It's made me realize that I CAN'T BE WITH SOMEONE WHO CAN'T BE THERE FOR ME.  What can i say?  I guess i'm high maintenance when it comes to the communication department as well as attention.  I'm just tired of coming home from work to find his ass on the couch, passed out...CONSTANTLY.  When can i have someone to cuddle with in bed, and to play with their hair, and have them COHERENT where i can be asked, 'How was work, hon?' or hear me babble on about the crazy things that happened to me during my day....

No, i can't do that...Because i come home to a passed out body and the sound of crickets.  I'm lonely. 

I can't call someone up at 4 or 5 in the morning to talk...

Will someone be my friend?

so yeah, i've grown distant to him.  He says 'give me another chance!' and i point out (very calmly) that this is like the 3rd or 4th chance THIS SUMMER that i've given him...and he shows NO progress whatsoever.  I used to be the person to get mad, and yell.  I'm WAY past that point now.  I don't give a fuck.  I really don't!  I pointed out that his brother and mother will never change, so he won't.  Harsh, maybe, but like i said, i'm past the point of being angry and hiding words to make everything sound better.  It's best to let everything out in the open.

Thanks to his extremely unattractive drunk self, my sexual libido has run out the door like speedy gonzalez.  Is it wrong for me to not be 'attracted to him sexually' anymore since most of the time i see him, he's already piss ass drunk and swaying around like a drunk sailor?  STuffing his mouth with whatever food he can find and leaving a mess everywhere?

I don't think so.  I'm happy w/out it, though.  Geeze...never thought i'd say that before.

I've told him all this, about growing distant, about no attraction anymore...And all he says is 'i need to straighten up'.  When those words come out of his mouth, i just shake my head and walk out of the room.

I feel more like i'm living with a guy who just happens to sleep in my bed every once in awhile...Not to have sex, just to sleep there.  I don't feel like i have a 'boyfriend'.  Not all the time, anyway.

Sure, he helps me out by lending me money, takes me out, showers me with kisses (ugh) but once a beer is opened, he's not that person...Or if he is, he can't seem to keep his hands off of me.

So why...why am i still with him?  Because i have nowhere else to go.  AND...i always have the option of crashing on someones couch if it gets really rough.  NO...He does not hit me.  If anything, i'm the one that hits him when he gets stupid.  Yes, i know that's not healthy...but i have a problem channeling my anger.

I suppose if something else comes along that seems a hell of a lot better, i'll grab at the chance.  I don't hide any of my feelings from Justin-i tell him.  It's not like i'm going behind his back or anything...

Friends, anyone?"

"event","Well...


I've neglected this website for quite sometime now-so i thought i'd let you all in on a little view of what has been going on in my life.

I still have one more payment on this bridesmaids dress for Jeni's wedding.  I better be putting some use to it besides this one wedding!  I still haven't found shoes to wear...Maybe i could just go barefoot....I'll still be the shortest one.

I ran into Mrs. Westmeyer at Kroger on Thursday while i was in town for my Mom's birthday.  Here i am, carrying to bags of Red leaf lettuce, and looking for some dish liquid soap and (not wearing my glasses, so when i saw someone staring at me with their jaw open you can figure out what i was thinking).  We had a nice chat---We talked about the his/her bridal/groom shower in August.  

Talk about weird-i haven't seen most of these people in more than a couple of years, and here we are all going to be reunited at a WEDDING.  I can't help but feel a little anxious about the whole thing-i'm not great around large groups-especially people that knew me when i was in High School-not now, years later.

That got me to thinking about how different i am from when i was.  Aside from the physical aspect of everything, I've grown to be accustomed to the 'WGAF' attitude.  Not only that---High School was weird for me.  I can honestly say though, that of all the people i've known in High School-Jeni has been the one to stick with me.  She's visited (although i don't visit her often...shame on me) and she's pretty much the ONLY person i'll make an effort to visit if i'm in town...And even now, that's rare.

We can pick up the phone from one another and start off like we talk to each other everyday.


*Sigh*


I love the new place i live in.  It's at an extremely reasonable price, and throughout the weekday, during the day, i'm all by myself-free to run around naked or just slouch on the couch and zombie out on the t.v.

I still have yet to schedule a cook-out.  I really need to do some landscaping out front, but i'm terrified of all the bugs out there.

I ended up working a 12 hour shift yesterday.  The Russians came to wax the floor inside the lab, and i got stuck there until 3 this morning.  I'm sure John will be excited about that.

-I don't want to go back to school.
-I miss people.

I better go-i have less than an hour to get ready for work...


For all of you who are reading this-Wear sunscreen."

<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>Knowing that i got done with my summer class the Friday before July 4th, I still haven't had time to be by myself.&nbsp; That Sunday, my Mom and Brad came into town to do the DMA's Convention at the Opryland Hotel.&nbsp; I helped them out Sunday, Monday, and then on Tuesday.&nbsp; On Wednesday and Thursday, they had left to go to Flordia to do a Tremaine's convention so I was left alone with the other vendors for those two days.&nbsp; TALK ABOUT STRESS!!!!!&nbsp; Needless to say, i didn't make too much.&nbsp; On Thursday, I had to pack up all the merchandise and take it to the loading dock.&nbsp; I was driving Justins' Dad's HUGE Ford F150...Down Briley pkwy where all the construction is, and the lanes are REALLY close together.</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>I finally got back to the Boro-My dad and the kids and Linda were waiting there.&nbsp; (For like 30 min, b/c i had to stop on the side of the road and put a cardboard box into a trashbag b/c i was getting ready to run into some major rain).&nbsp; The box got a little wet, but didn't soak through to the clothes (THANK GOD!)</EM></P>
<P><EM>Dad and Linda left shortly after the kids got there.&nbsp; Dad instructed me on giving Abbi her meds.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><EM>I must admit, i thought it would be harder to take care of the kids-but they weren't much of a problem.&nbsp; We all managed to keep ourselves busy doing things like going to the Greenway and playing with the 'waterfalls' and going to my apartment and getting most of my other belongings (Thanks kids!)</EM></P>
<P><EM>Abbi made dinner both Friday and Saturday night.&nbsp; I ended up not going to work b/c:</EM></P>
<P><EM>a). I felt like crap---i think i have a major ulcer or some kind of gastrointestinal problems</EM></P>
<P><EM>b). I felt even more like crap---I kept on breaking out into cold sweats and coughing.</EM></P>
<P><EM>c). The kids were here-and hey-how many times do i get to spend time with just <STRONG><U>them?</U></STRONG> Not their friends, or Mom and Dad and everyone else, just THEM.</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>I would post some pics that i took while we were at the Greenway, but unfortunately they are on my sisters camera, and well...She still hasn't sent me any.</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>All in all, i don't want to go to work today, b/c now my sickness has turned into a head cold or something like that.&nbsp; I'm waking up with no voice, or sounding like a really sick person, and coughing up phlegm.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Tomorrow, my Mom and Brad will be back from FL and coming here to p/u their merchandise.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><EM>I have a dentist appt. Tomorrow.&nbsp; They called this morning, a missed call, but didn't leave a message, so i'm glad that i called the # back, otherwise i wouldn't have known that i had a dentist appt. Tomorrow.</EM></P>
<P><EM>I think i'll go into work some tomorrow, to make up for my lost hours on work for Friday.</EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>In the meantime, i have laundry to do, and a couple of boxes to unpack.&nbsp; I've got 97% of my things from the apartment.&nbsp; My room is totally clean, except for the white cable cord that i can't unscrew from the wall. (At the old apartment).&nbsp; I still have *some* food in the fridge, a couple of items in the laundry room, and then a couple of this and that in the kitchen/ living room.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>I guess my SUMMER time for myself will start on Wednesday--even then, i'll probably be pressure washing Lona's house for some $$$$$$.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>My mom's and aunts birthday is this Thursday, so i'll be in town then to spend it with them....I have NO idea how old my Mother is going to be.</EM></P>"

I started my summer course at motlow---other than the fact that i drive about the same distance in the opposite direction as if i was driving to work, it's not so bad....


Well, unless you count us having a test every monday after having only 4 days to cover COMPLETE chapters in anatomy and physiology....

.......then it's bad.

I haven't cleaned my apartment in about a month and 1/2 now...I refuse to.  I figure, since i'll be moving out at the end of this month, i shouldn't have to clean it now, and then when i move...Then again, it's getting pretty damn groty.  I did clean the kitchen-but then i came back from work, and it was all messy and piled with dishes, so i said 'FUHGETTAABOUTIT'

I haven't had much time to have fun...but it's all good.  I figure 5 or 6 weeks of hard rigourous studying and i'll be good to go for a great long party when i'm done.

Anyway-i've gotta leave to go to school now. I hope everyone is enjoying their summer vacation and hopes that everyone is being safe :)"

"event","I'm drunk.


I opted to buy a 6 pack of amberbock on my way home tonight after work.  I don't know why i did it, it just seems like the 'thing to do'.  I was going to be alone tonight-justin was at some party with girls fighting in a jello pit.
I really don't seem to care.  I think, if he were to cheat on me, i'd just be non-chalant about it.  I know this sounds really weird on my part, since those who know me know me as the jealousy monster, but i think i'm at the point in my relationship where i just don't care.  


Seriously...So what, we've been together for 3+ years...?  People would say that it's just a number, and although i'd be going against my beliefs in all the things we've been together in that time, i'm beginning to believe that yes, it is just a number.  Who cares if i've been with someone for 10 years?  If things aren't going well, and i'm not happy, then what is  the use?  Sure, we've had great times, and along that comes the bad times...But if you aren't happy, then what is the point?




I've finally figured out that i'm good with relationships.  Sure, i've been in long relationships, but they've never really worked out.  I'm even at the point now where my parents expect me me to get married to Justin and have kids with him...The sad part?  If i was pregnant with his child right now, i'd be terrified...Not so if it was in the past.  I would be happy, but i've been getting really tiresome of his drinking (and i know i've been like that before) but now more than ever...I do'nt know exactly why, but i'm  at this point in my life right now where im just REALLy tired of it...Like i said, if he cheated on me, then so what?  What can i do about it?  Absolutely nothing.  I could kick and scream and throw a fit, but that wouldn't change anything.

I had a dream the other night.  I was pregnant with Justin's child, and he was (in front of me) telling this girl on the phone that he couldn't come and see her tonight.  He was talking to his 'other' girlfriend  right in front of my face.  In my dream, i got mad.  I basically beat the crap out of him, stomping on his balls, all the while carrying his child.  Then i told him that i'd make his life a living hell, take all of his money, and his child.


Is that who i really am?  Am i really that kind of female that would do something like that?  


...I think i am.



If i were to get 'fucked over' by a guy, i think i truly would make his life a living hell.  I think that would be the only way to get any real satisfaction out of it.






I'm tipsy.  did i already mention that?  I'm too lazy to scroll up to see if i had said that.

I talked to Mike again tonight.  Why can't i just be friends with him?  Why does it have to bend down to some sort of 'akwardness?'  If he comes to see me this week, we are both convinced that it would be akward, but only if we allow it to be.  I don't want him to feel that way, I really don't...but then again, i don't want him running off and not talking to me for another 2-3 years again either.  I really do feel he's the ONLY person that can understand who i am and how i feel.

It's a 3BR house 2 BA and  has a nice deck in the back w/ a front porch.  It is owned by a co-worker of Justin's who works 2 jobs and is NEVER home (except to sleep).  I figure it's the best choice, and the cheapest, although the bedroom is i believe, smaller than the one i have right now.  If i can use the 2nd bedroom to put my computer desk and some bookshelves in it, then im good to go.  Luckily, he has a shed in the backyard where i can store my plastic boxes.  In the next couple of weeks, i REALLY need to go through al of my junk and get rid of a LOT of stuff.  I figure i'll pep myself up by buying a whole bag of trashbags.  I think i can go for the huge black yard bags that people use for stuffing leaves and grass into.  That should do the job quite nicely.

I'll have to trade beds with justin---i have a queen, and he has a full.  i'm not quite sure how much of a size difference it is, but when the BR is 11X11 (my feet, not regular feet) i'm sure that small change will make a lot of difference.  


i'll actually have MY OWN bathroom.  wEll...if people visit, they'll be peeing in that bathroom, but i've had to share bathrooms with each of my roommates, and its exciting to know that i'll have my own.
The backyard is fenced in, so Buddy will be moving back in with me.  He'll stay outside, of course, b/c i don't think i want to deal with all of his hair again.

You can't beat that for 200 a month.


I think i'm depressed.  I don't know exactly what i am.  It's like...WEll, i don't know.  I just don't seem to be very happy.  I think more than anything, i'm discontent with my life right now.

"event","Well, i'm officially 22 now.  I don't feel it at all.  A LOT has happened since Saturday....


Saturday:
Woke up after 3 hours of sleep and drove to Pulaski to see my 'sister' graduate from Martin United Methodist College.  I think i already posted this info, so i'll move on....

Sunday:
Went to work, had fun doing pretty much nothing except trying to stay awake.  I had been up since 6am that morning from cooking my Mom's Breakfast w/ the kids.  Met with Linda and my Dad again for coffee (before going to work).  Reached 120,000 miles on my car. *yikes*
Recieved a phone call from Mike, whom i haven't heard from in a LONG time.  Didn't even go to sleep that night, Mike and i talked from like 130am - 420am.  I had to leave at 5 am for Tunica w/ John, Mandy, and Justin.
Packed clothes as fast as i could and went on.

Monday:
Drove to Tunica.  barely got enough sleep...had to listen to Justin Fart constantly by putting his hand on his buttcheek and allowing the airflow to not juggle his butt cheeks. *gross*
After driving from th Casinos to the town of tunica 3 times, we finally reached our destination.  There is not SHIT out there.  Fields and fields of....well, i don't even know b/c they aren't growing.  The reason we went back and forth so many times was b/c i needed to cash a check, the guys wanted to buy some liqour and Justin also had to find an Amsouth, that doesn't exist over there.  Little did we know that if we went down the road to where some of the Casinos were, we'd find all of that and more (well, not the amsouth, but an ATM).
The first one we stopped at was Sams Town.  no luck there...I drank about 3 or 4 bloody marys and then dveloped a headache later on that day.
We ended up staying at Hollywood-they have a casino right there in the hotel, and the rooms were decent.  there was a replica of the titanic, batmobile, elvis's car, and the car from back to the future as well as other things.
We decided to hang out by the pool-i was having fun until my headache hit really hard, and i wasn't really enjoying myself.  That's what you get when you drink early on in the day.  MAndy and i made a beer run, and by the time i got back, i didn't want to get back into the pool, which in turn made Justin mad and caused us to have a spat in the pool.

Needless to say, that day went pretty shitty, w/ him being 'tipsy' or whatever and unable to reason with.  I ended up going back to the hotel room and taking a shower, crying, b/c my feelings were hurt from being called a 'retarded-party pooper-bipolar'.

Times like that make me want to flush his head down a toilet several times.  He can't be reasoned w/ when he's drinking-and i told him to stop drinking so much b/c it was only like 4 in the afternoon, and i know he'd be smashed by 10pm.

Everyone else came back upstairs, and i know i was making mandy and john feel uncomfortable, but I JUST CAN'T HANDLE HIM WHEN HE'S LIKE THAT.  Seriously...I was thinking about calling my aunt to come pick me up, that's how terrible i was feeling w/ everything.

Some may say i was acting like a Baby, but hell...I guess i'm not the type of person to just go buck-wild.    I could've been in the past, but not now.  And for someone to accuse me of being bi-polar?  Unless you have a phd behind your name, i don't want to hear it.

That night, i dolled myself up, and went out.  I was being quiet, and a little tired.  I ended up having *some* luck on the slots, but around 1130pm, i encountered a extremely drunk justin that was really getting on my nerves.  I had been drinking, but i wasn't in the mood to be drunk happy, so i was more or less just drinking, w/o the effects.


Later on that night, i finally got back to the hotel room and passed out myself, only to wake up the next morning feeling refreshed.

Everyone else had a hangover.

Tuesday:

My birthday!!!! I was 22, and feeling kind of depressed.  I felt better when i recieved voicemails from my siblings, telling me happy birthday, and then one from my mom, singing me happy birthday.  It made tears come to my eyes.  i guess i'm spoiled w/ birthdays, used to the 'whole day' being my day.  Not so this time.  No cake, no card, actually, no happy birthday from my present group until i mentioned that i recieved voicemails from my family.  I guess it's just that once you get older, nothing like that seems to matter anymore.  I don't care if i'm 80.  Im going to have a cake, card, and presents to open...Even if it happens to be from a complete stranger.

Nonetheless, i didn't want to spoil my own day w/ my attitude, so i straightened up and made the best out of it.  Kind of hard when Mandy and John were complaining of their headaches and how crappy they felt.  THat was ok, though---I was feeling just fine.  My dad called, and wished me a happy birthday, so did my aunt.  I got a text message from Elaine, Stephanie, and another voicemail from Justin (my other friend).  It was great.

We ended up staying until around 4 or 5...one or the other.  John and Mandy didnt' gamble-they found some booth to sleep in.  I became addicted to the quarter machine and started to play like 3 of them at a time.  I was happy sipping on *more* bloody marys and making the tips of my fingers black from all of the quarters.

We ended up leaving and going back home.  It was an okay drive. I offered to drive, but mandy doesn't like other people driving her car.  Then we got home, and i ate my mom's leftover ribs w/ the other people and watched National Treasure.

Wednesday:
My mom calls me at 8, only to reveal that she's about 20 minutes away from Murfreesboro.  I jump into the shower, and get ready.  She's taking me to Atlanta today.

We ended up eating some great food, shopping, and then eating some more great food.  I drove half the way home and then she drove back to Alabama.  I love my mom.  She's the greatest. :)



And so now, it's Thursday, and i have to be at work by 5 pm.  I'm wondering how i'm going to spend this day...I think i traveled most of the South this past weekend...

I guess i'll start by taking a shower."

Well, I spent the weekend with my mom.  She finished in 4 hours and 28 minutes.  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!

I had a good time with her, although i think she was disappointed when she found out what i'm going to be doing for the rest of my college career.  I don't blame her, i'm a little disappointed in myself as well, but dammit, it'll get me out of school sooner, and Lord knows i need that!!!

The only next issue i need to worry about it my grades for this semester and if i'm even going to get in.

It's weird waking up on a Monday morning and not having to worry about going to school...I kind of like it, actually."

Not too bad, though.  took my final....Not going to talk about it.

I'm SO tired.  It didn't help that i didn't get to sleep much last night.  I thought i'd be able to see my Mom before going to work,b ut that's not going to happen.  She hasn't even left Madison yet.

So now, i'm just waiting until i want to venture to Party City and retrieve BDAY stuff for the birthday babies...and a cake.  CAn't forget the cake.  I'm out.


OH yeah, i can only take ONE class this summer at motlow.  They are only offering one that i need to take, and it's at an inconvenient time, but bah...if i have to do it, i'll do it.  I'll end up waking up early in the morning, driving to moore county, going to class for 4 hours, and then driving straight to work.  IT's really going to suck. I should just take the summer off...."

I kept on thinking how they got the brightly coloured cloths, and the stones and stuff to make their homes.

That is so me, just always looking behind the big picture of things.



OH...Stephanie isn't going to move in with me.  She has decided that it would be best for her and Madison to live by themselves.  In a way, a small way, i'm relieved, but now i have to find ANOTHER roommate.



Anyone want to come and live with me?!  I'm only the bitchiest person to live with, i promise!!!!

I can't go to sleep. it's 2 am, and i have a final at 1230 tomorrow.  Am i ready for it?  Sure...

"event","Allergies suck.

Even though the springtime is a beautiful time filled with blooming flowers and etc...IT KILLS ME.  (Literally).  I don't know why God thought to play such a cruel joke on me to have me suffer in such a beautiful season. Sure, i've got the allergy pills, the nosespray, and well, i don't have but NEED the eye drops, they just don't seem to work this year.

I have gone so far to by an air purifier for my bedroom.  Nothing big, just a small one.  The HEPA filters cost just about as much as the dame purifier itself.  it doesn't help.

So, i wake up every morning sounding like a 'foghorn'.  Hahahaa...Justin has offered to get me 'nose surgery'....that's REALLY funny.

Last night at work was okay. I was in a silly mood.  I didn't feel like i got much done, but still managed to clock out before 4:30 in the morning, so that's a plus.  At least i made up for me leaving 30 minutes early on Friday.

I'm supposed to go to they gym w/ Mandy today.  I STILL can't seem to find my Student ID card, and i'll be damned if i'm going to pay 2 dollars just to work out. (Yeah, call me a cheapskate).

Since i've stopped going to my AP class, i have no school today.  I thought about getting ready to tackle this jungle room of mine, but i'm not feeling it.  

Gina at work lended me 'The Village' so i think i may curl up on my couch and watch it.  I know it's probably going to scare the shit out of me.  I get scared at the stupidest things.



My birthday is coming up.  I will be TWENTY TWO.  I don't feel special about it, and i don't think you are supposed to feel special.  Actually, i just feel like even more of a loser and even older...

I want to go camping
I want to go to Tunica
I want to go to Gatlinburg

I guess i just want to go SOMEWHERE and not spend it here.  Mothers Day is that Sunday before, and i'll be in Madison to take her out to breakfast or something.  My parents haven't asked what i wanted, but my DAd has gotten to hte point where he doesn't ask-just does.  I want to tell them that i don't want anything, don't deserve anything.  I still owe my dad 450 dollars, and my mom?  Well, she's in a tight bind w/ money as it is.  I just want some of her FOOD.  

Speaking of food, i'm STARVING.  I don't know what's been up with me lately, but i've had an appetite of a horse.  (no, i haven't been eating a whole bunch of grass).  I went semi-grocery shopping yesterday, just got a couple of items.  I may venture into my kitchen to see what i can find.

OH!!!!

I got my CDROM-DVD drive to work again.  Thank you, Cynthia at HP support who told me how to fix it.  I don't know what the hell all that crap is that she made me do, but it did the job.  I'm still at awe as to how i could have those drives one day, and then not have them the next.

Computers are weird.

Hope everyone is doing well-i seem to be in better spirits...For now, at least."

"event","This month sucks ass.  Finals are coming up, and I already know that i'm not going to pass yet another AP class.  Maybe this is God telling me that i shouldn't go through with this major, but i refuse to step down from it.  I haven't told my parents.  I'm at the point right now where i really don't give a damn about myself, but i feel so bad for my Dad, because he's paying for my education.

That's why i'm going to tell him to stop paying for it.  I don't want to feel as though he's wasting his money on something that is not going to be getting me anywhere.  I'd rather rack up more debt on my behalf then feel responsible for something like that.

I've also been feeling so damn emotional.  To the point where i'll watch some stupid commercial and have tears in my eyes.  TEARS IN MY EYES OVER A COMMERCIAL...Yeah, so i'm a woman, and i pump myself with extra estrogen every month...I hate it.  Sometimes it's not so bad, but other times, i'm so sensitive, i feel like a little girl left behind.

As for my relationship---Well, i don't know if it's a mixture of the stress and emotions, or what, but I feel sometimes like i'm the only pushing it.  I'm tired of becoming a wallflower when his 'friends' are around.  It's like an invisible cloak is put on top of me and no one can see me.  Don't get me wrong-i don't think very highly of most of his friends anyway, but still, common courtesy, please!

I'm tired of everything.  I clean the apartment, scrubbing it, and making it look great, and once i leave the house, and come back, it's all messy.  It's a never-ending battle, and i don't know why i continue to clean.  For some reason, i feel as though it's the only thing i can control (for a small period of time) and see the effects of it.  For example, dirty dishes...You clean them and scrub down the sink and VIOLA! you have see the effect of what you have done.  I don't feel like i can do that with my life.  School, life goals, losing weight, it just doesn't seem to be making any difference to me.

I know when i tell my parents that i probably won't be passing one or maybe even 2 of my classes, shit is going to hit the roof, but if i don't qualify for financial aid for this summer, i won't be going to school this summer, and that will further my graduation date even farther, but at this point, i really don't care.  I know my mom has been so proud of me, going to school and working full time, but it's beginning to take a toll on me, and it's not making me happy.

I was talking to my Aunt yesterday and just about told her that i was ready to quit school, or at least take a break from it.  I feel like such a LOSER.  Seriously, i mean i have nothing to show for all of this time and money going down the drain.  

I'd rather take up some job that pays well and move my way up the ladder.  I really don't know what to do.  i'm thinking about taking some phlebo classes at the red cross this summer so i can be certified, and at least that will broaden my horizons in jobs.  (That is, if i don't go to school this summer).


I'm depressed, and that's the end of that.  I don't get like this very often, but when i do, i try to cope as well as i can with it.  Sometimes it's not so easy, but i try my best most of the time.  

In addition to that, I guess my boyfriend doesn't really realize how to 'take care' of me when i'm in this state.  
Do you ever feel like you're lookng for love in the wrong places and compensating so you don't have to get hurt again?


I'm off to get ready for work now :|"

"event","IT's funny that everytime i put my fingers to the keyboard and start to begin my 'journal entry', my fingers want to say ""I realized"".....

Is this something my subconscious is trying to tell me?

I DO realized that i'm a loser.  4+ years of college and i have nothing.  No degree, nothing...Just a shitload of credit hours that don't amount to anything.  Priority registration was sometime this week for me.  I didn't even jump to the thought of registering.  Usually, i'll skip a class to register at my alotted time, but strangely enough, i didn't that this semester.  

I'm REALLY sick of school.  Almost to the point that i'll quit.  Both of my parents have accepted that i may do that.  Hell, at the rate i'm going w/ my classes, i should.  I figure, if i take the next year off, i'll WORK MY ASS OFF (Literally).  Since my endeavor to lose weight, i've lost a total of almost 15 pounds...Needless to say, i'm not THAT fat as a cow that i was 4 months ago.  But yeah, i'd get another job, pay off my debt, and then i'll have a clean start.  No debt, no needing to work as much = more time to take school more seriously.

I find that i'm not as 'conservative' as i used to be.  Me? Party?!?!  Nah...Crystal doesn't do parties.  Well, not big huge ones.  I like to have me, close friends, and something amusing to do keep ourselves busy.  Sure i've endeavored the keg parties and frat parties (Vandy is crazy).  I've even subjected myself to joining people i work with to party like them.  The only white person at a party?  That's me.

I guess now that i've totally accepted the fact that i'm under fewer restraints, I am letting myself loose just a bit.  

....I just hope i don't lose it as time goes by.  Sometimes, i feel like i've been losing my mind little by litte day by day.  I don't want to end up being one of those sets of parents that are so oblivious to what their children do in their personal lives...




Oh well...Just a few thoughts going through me head."

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was wearing a tank top (too big for me), no bra, and some flimsy ass shorts.&nbsp; No shoes or socks...running across the courtyard and onto the gravel road where pebbles and stuff were pounding into the soles of my feet.&nbsp; Boobs flopping up and down, for a minute there i thought i'd have to put one back into my tank top, but i didn't care...I didn't want 50 dollars to fly out through the window.&nbsp; Finally..Justin spotted Cheeky.&nbsp; She was at the end of our apartment complex on the sidewalk, just walking around as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was sooooooo relieved.</P>
<P>Yesterday, i found a house for rent.&nbsp; It was absolutely PERFECT.&nbsp; It had a huge fenced--in backyard, 3 bedrooms, one was really really small-it could've been the nursery or maybe even a study.&nbsp; Only one bathroom, but it was a nice big bathroom, and a dining area, huge living room and decent kitchen.&nbsp; The closet spaces in the bedrooms weren't all that big, but they had a garage (that couldn't be used as a car garage) with PLENTY of space and wouldn't you know it, a perfect spot for Justin and his friends to hang out in there...My plan was to get a place with a fenced in backyard that allowed dogs, and a small of to the side of the house shack or something where Justin could entertain his friends....I was ecstatic!!!! I had finally found the perfect spot.&nbsp; We called,&nbsp; but the person was busy and all we got was a 'we'll call you' type of thing...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, they called back...Unfortunately, it had already been rented out...Justin didn't bother to ask how much it was for rent.&nbsp; I was thinking it would be like 700 to 800 a month...I wanted to know how much it would cost so i could stop feeling so bad that it had gotten away from me.</P>

nada.
zilch.


*sigh*......

Cheeky is molting right now....Do you know that the new feathers she is growing out don't come out as nice fluffy feathers?  no...It's more like they are 'rolled' up feathers that feel hard and thin....I don't really know how the process goes on putting them out to be all fluffy and stuff, but i'm positive it involves her beak seperating each strand until they are all flared out....

Now i am probably totally wrong, b/c i don't know what i am talking about...Bullshit...coming out of my ass. ;)

She's also really moody now that she's molting...and making a mess on my computer desk w/ her mullet seeds...

"event","Ok, well not anymore...i flicked it off....

Btw-i had gotten a cockatiel-i don't randomly have wildbirds fly through my bedroom window and relieve themselves in my bedroom ;)

I hope everyone had a good Easter Sunday....I really did plan on going to Church, but like always-i didn't.  I'm sad to admit that i have not yet attended a church weekly since i've moved to the boro----That's just about 3 years.  I found a Methodist Church down the road-St. Marks United Methodist Church.  It looks HUGE!!!!


Justin and I threw Stephanie her baby shower this past Friday.  It was a success-especially for use b/c we had never attended a baby shower before, much less host it.  I must admit-it's extremely expensive...But we all still had fun.

I'm in the market to look for a big(ger) house to live in...I figure with a child coming soon, we need more room.  I can't believe it!!! In less than 3 months, there will be a baby girl in the apartment...*sigh*  I love babies.  I've always wanted to have one.... :)

Justin's brother is in the living room right now.  he got kicked out of his parents house...Last night, after i came home from work-he was ranting and raving and thanking me over and over again for allowing me and Tara to let him stay the night.  I figure it's the least i can do for him...I just hope he gets his problems straightened out....

Justin is extremely worried about him.  He's talking about killing himself and the such.  i hope he doesn't do that...

Well i'm off to look for some pectoral muscles to draw.  I have a group project due tomorrow night...I haven't really even started it too much.  I hate this damn class...


I hope everyone is doing well-My best wishes to all of you.  May you find happiness at the bottom of your coffee cup. :)"

"event","Wow..my 'paid' account expired.  That sucks-I'd like to thank Rebecca Skelly for paying my paid account last year. :)

anyway...spring break-nothing spectacular.  I called out of work on Monday and relaxed...I needed it.  ON Tuesday, i went back to Madison, and spent time with my beautiful family.  I really do miss that bunch!  I even got to see the Paxton girls. :)

I realized something...I think guys (and you male species can comment on this if you'd like) make an effort (or don't make an effort) to get to 'know-know' their girlfriends the way females do to males.  For instance (and i'm not saying ALL males do this-i'm talking on behalf of my boyfriend), I will make every effort to know about Justin-his likes, dislikes, etc.  Whereas, he (the obnoxious bastard, i love him) doesn't do that.  I heard him make a comment since we were talking about his friend Gary and how he and his 'girlfriend' weren't really together anymore (his excuse: they moved too fast, and there was nothing 'new' in the relationship) So they broke up?  Anyway, Justin says to me ""That's why I don't want to know everything about you, i don't want to get bored"".  I didn't know if i wanted to take that as a compliment or not...But i got to thinking about it---He's right, and maybe this is his explanation for not being as (what's the word?) 'knowing' to me as i think he should be...Then again-lately, i've been noticing that he has been remembering the 'small' things...Does this mean that he's attaching himself even more?  I have no idea-but i have an inkling.  


*sigh*

I did'nt even do ANY homework this week. I'm hoping (and this is BAD) that there are no surprise tests or anything like that going on..If there is, i'm in a deep pile of shit."

"event","So...I semi-confronted/scared away my roommate.  Why you ask?  Hahahhaha...So, on Tuesday night, Justin and i went to eat at Demo's and he bought us both a top sirloin steak. It came with a side of spaghetti and i ate that before the steak, and was STUFFED and so was he, so we brought home our not even half-eaten steaks.  We were going to eat them on Wednesday, after he got out of class.

Tuesday night, she and her 'boyfriend' bring over the guy who had cocaine the last couple of weeks ago...the guy i said for her to not bring over b/c she didn't know him, plus he had that stuff, and etc?  Yeah...same guy.  RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE!  I didn't say anything at the time... I was stewing.
She says nothing to me that night.

Wednesday morning...I'm waking up to get ready for class, and that guy is asleep on my couch.  He left last night, but apprently he came right back sometime during the night.  I didn't think anything of it...I went to class.

I get back from my class, walk into my front door, and there is that guy standing over the kitchen sink, eating something.  I thought nothing of it.  I gave him a weird look (still not knowing who the hell he is, no one bothered to introduce me) and walked into my room.  I could hear the two fuckbirds making noises in her bedroom, blah blah blah.

Billy leaves with the guy in tara's car.  She takes a shower.  I call my mom to tell her about the situation.  She offers to tlak to her, i say no, i'm waiting for her to get out, and then i'll talk to her.  by that time, Justin has come home from class, and i'm talking to him...phone rings...IT's billy.  I tell her she has a phone call, and then she literally dashes out of the door before i can say 2 words to her....IS someone avoiding me?!?!  I think so.....

So, we decide to eat our steaks...


We can't eat our steaks...Someone else ate them.  There, in the trashcan, was our takeout platter...empty as hell....2 top sirloin 16 oz. steaks GONE...BOTH OF THEM.

Justin is pisesd, because he bought them.  I'm pissed, and i tell Justin to call billy's cell phone.  He starts talking to billy, saying how rude it was to eat or have his 'friend' eat our food.  Turns out, he (or whoever) ate the whole box of granola cereal i have (well, he left like .0002 of a bowl left in the box) and left a half-eaten bowl of cereal with milk in it in the sink..That is what he was munching on.  He didn't even bother to throw away the box of cereal or close it...How rude.  I hope the milk was rotten.

So i tell justin to give methe damn phone...I start to talk-but wait!  Billy hands the phone over to Tara....I'm pissed, so i'm not talking straight. (normal for me) and i'm asking her why she brings these people over, who eat my 40 dollar steaks, cereal, leaves a mess, leaves bloody loogies in my bathroom sink, etc, and i don't even know who the fuck he is!  She says she had no idea anything like that was going on (of course, she's a damn blonde) and then apologizes.  I told her that her apology doesn't really work over the phone, especially since i need to talk to her, and everytime i try to, she dashes out the door or just avoids me.  She started to say something, but i cut her off.  THEN....i asked if she even went to school or work anymore.  She sounded offended, and said that she was on her way to class right now...(Whatever, she's always coming home from class/work around 5 to watch the simpsons...it was 430).  i said what the hell ever, then (and the phone is breaking up at this time) i ask if billy was selling drugs...she says 'WHAT?  NO!!!!' like she's all surprised, and i told her that we'll talk aobut it when she gets home.  I ask her when she'll be home, she says later.

Well...i go to my night class, but justin is at home.  from 6-9, she doesn't come home.  I get home at 8:30 (got out of class early) still not tara or billy.  I stay home that whole night, still no-show.  I scared her off, i think, because she knows that i'm onto something.  The only reason i think he's a drug dealer is b/c she's not going to work, and he doesn't work....She lives off friggin' food stamps, and has been eating out for the past couple of weeks, coming home with shopping bags every couple of days...WHERE THE HELL DOES THE MONEY COME FROM?!?!?!?  

Exactly.  Plus, i've heard him on the phone..and he had the audacity to leave marijuana hidden under my coffeet table out in the living room area one day.  I told justin the next time i find anything like that, it's going straight into the trash/toilet (i don't know if it'll clog or not...i've never dumped drugs down a toilet).  WHO THE HELL HIDES DRUGS IN A COMMON AREA WHERE MORE THAN 1 PERSON LIVES?!?!?

So we've got the shit that was left on the toilet....bloody loogies left in the bathroom sink, and this morning, Justin found a cigarette butt left in the shower.

This never happened before we had mr. 'i just got out of jail' staying here.

So it's 3:25, almost 24 hours since the phone call, and she still isn't here.  I'm not going to sit here forever to see if she ever comes home, but she'll run out of clean underwear/clothes soon enough and will have to come back to clean herself.

I'll be waiting."

"event","I parked on the side of my apt. building this morning after work, and it was right above my roommie's bedroom floor (2nd floor).  I could hear her doing the damn thing...AT first i thought it was my imagination, but as soon as i walked into the apartment (mind you her beddroom is on the other side of the apartment from the front door) i could hear her screaming and moaning....and whatever guy she has in there yelling some obscenities....


Yucky.


IT's been about 25 minutes...and they are STILL going at it."

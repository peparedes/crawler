"event","My actually starting to game again has taken a big step towards reality, and it all hit me: I've got to start small. 

I'm essentially starting over from scratch, whatever skills I had are covered in rust.  I'm going to be using a new system, with new players, in a new format.  Let's see, what else could be challenging?  Oh yeah, I essentially have the same time available as I have had for the past two years.  The next chunk of time opens in fall 2013, when Finn enters kindergarten. 

All this implies that I've got to delay the big game that's been percolating for a couple of years now.  Instead, I'm going to dive in to a little story, most reminiscent of _Dust to Dust_.  Instead of finding the right forum/wiki/chatroom doohickey, I'll use email.  Yes, email, ancient and venerable conveyor of text.  I'll avoid any system that is map-oriented (sorry D&D) or requires a lot of depth (sorry HERO, GURPS).  I'm using the _Feng Shui_ system, and hopefully style, though not the setting.  It supports a lot of broad types, plays fast (in theory), and is almost too simple.  (Must resist making modifications, that way lies madness, and delay).

The last thing I can do is to keep the number of players small.  Fortunately, I don't exactly have a player group in mind, thought Josh and Ross have a place at the table, if they're up for it.

Since launching a game before the HallowthanksMas season is certifiable, we won't start playing until January.  We'll take some time and get characters, then I'll work them in to the scenario I've got going.

There.  By posting this, I have officially started the process.  Wish me luck."

So Thankgiving this year, we didn't want to fly, and we decided to visit my sister, w/ hubby and extremely adorable toddler.  Bonus, my folks are coming.  There's innumerable fascinating details about this trip, but the good news is that Finn didn't freak out tied down in a car seat for 8 hours (or more).   He saw cows and trains and lots of his eyelids.  Sam loved it, with grandparents doting and lots of face time with Mommy (and a stream of surprises doesn't hurt).   We overdid it Saturday, pushing all the way through Montana and we are just beat. Worth it, though."

<lj-cut text=""Would this work?"">
My understanding of the financial crisis, is, in a word, minimal.  Housing prices fell, so people couldn't just sell their home when they had to start actually paying back the ARMs they used to buy the house with insufficient cash and/or income.  More houses on the market, prices fall, foreclosures skyrocket, mortgage-backed securities lose value rapidly.  Companies that leveraged those securities are suddenly bankrupt.  Basically, that's the issue, right?

Now the govm't is thinking about paying $700 billion to buy all those toxic mortgage-backed securities and prevent a domino-effect wave of crippling bankruptcies and tight credit (which prevents businesses on the brink from riding it out).  Oy vay.  But back up a miniute....

The U.S. census (http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/annual07/ann07t9.html)
says that the housing inventory (estimated) in 2007 was about 128 million.  According to CNN, 1.2 million of those homes are in foreclosure right now. Let's assume triple that number need to be refinanced or the ""owners"" will be unable to make payments.  That's 3.6 million.
$700 billion / 3.6 million = $194,000 each.  
http://www.realestateabc.com/outlook/overall.htm looks like the average home value in the nation is around $215,000.

Why not refinance all the homes that can't be sold, by the U.S. goverment extending the homeowners a fixed-rate loan to pay off the balance due on their house?  The mortgage-holder takes the refinanced loan,  and waives repayment penalties.  All of the sudden, the ""toxic"" securities have value again, perhaps less than before, but still something.  Some firms go bankrupt, the really stupid ones, but the rest tighten their belts.  Homeowners who just can't afford the house they're in (because they have no income, or seriously less income then they needed) would still be screwed and in foreclosure right-quick.  The U.S. gov't would soon own their homes.  People who can make their payments can still have a place to live, and keep their homes off the market.   Eventually, the government gets back most of the bailout money.  I'm sure renting out gov't-owned homes to low-income folks could get some traction in Congress.  Yes, Wall Street gets screwed a little... but that seems fair.  And going directly to the root of the problem means that it's actually solved, instead of continuing to snowball in the background.  

Yep, it's a lot of money.  As long as we're going to spend it, let's spend it in the right place.

More work required, then tonight, emails to Congress reps.  
</lj-cut>

Any input would be appreciated."

<u>Ender's Shadow</u> by Orson Scott Card
<lj-cut text=""AKA Publish your rewrites"">Don't get me wrong, it was a good read - I burned through it in a few weeks. 
However,having (at the time) just re-read <u>Ender's Game</u> - one of my all-time favorties, I just couldn't escape the sequelitis comparisons.  Bean is Ender, except painted in larger strokes.  While Ender had to fight bullies at school, Bean had to tame an entire child-eat-child culture.  Ender had his amazing game, Bean had the entire Battleschool to explore.  Ender was a brilliant leader.  Bean was often two steps ahead of him, frustrated that he was so slow.  Ender figured out that the games were rigged.  Bean figured out what the games really were.  I like a lot of the changes in the rewrite - Ender's Earth was very much a backdrop for exploring the Wiggin children and how they were each masters of it.  Bean's Earth seems to have a lot more meat on it, including (gasp) smart people who aren't directly involved in Bean's life.  Bean is, due to a Big Secret, more believable than Ender, and more flawed.  I do intend to read the rest of Bean's story, because I want to hear more about the world, and I don't feel like Bean has actually peaked in his first adventure (like Ender certainly did).</lj-cut>

<u>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</u> by Douglas Adams
<lj-cut text=""Still crazy after all these years"">
What to say?  Adams plays with words and ideas like Sam plays with markers and paints - no rules, little consistency, but lots of fun. 
When is ""flimsy"" a good thing?  When the novel is flimsy enough to stay out of the way of all the wacky asides.  The Hitchhiker books are classics in the same way the Simpsons are.  Which will be funny longer, '42' or ""D'oh""?

"event","On A Pale Horse by Piers Anthony
<lj-cut text=""Longwinded blather"">
Because it was handy, I read this old first of a series.  Reminded me why Anthony was fun, but no more than that.  Some interesting ideas, particularly with an eye toward game worlds.  The lengthy author's note gives decent insight into his writing process (and a fine, workmanlike process it is) and none at all about the book itself.  Mainly that's because the book delivers thoughts with the subtlety of a sledgehammer - hey, that's Anthony.  Whoa, this book is about how people face death!  
But enough carping, here's what I liked. The Eternals are pretty neat, as a group.  I'm almost interested to see the rest of them get their  moment in later sequels. Almost.  A good model for divine beings that are not omnipotent - like conventional fantasy world deities and their spheres of influence.  The world is very magical, moreso than most fantasy worlds (barring Xanth of course). And yet, I can't recall a single actual spell-casting. The magic was entirely bound up in magic items: common ones, simple ones, fantastically powerful ones. Magic exists in parallel and in competition with science.  Good to keep in mind the next time I'm thinking about Shadowrun or GURPS Cynosure
</lj-cut>

Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson
<lj-cut text=""gushing"">
Damn but this was fun to revisit.  Another fantastically realized world, though the Metaverse looks kind of stale compared to Second Life (shameless plug).  I got much more of the <i>nam-shub</i> stuff this time around, I guess I wasn't as focussed on Hiro, Y.T. and the Rat Thing kicking butt.   Fido the Rat Thing is now officially the guiding force behind the barbarian dwarf I have in development.   I did notice that this book was mostly literary play - Stephenson really did put things in just because they were cool.  Best example - ""I'm sure they'll listen to reason.""

"event","The Hobbit, 2/15/07

Great to revisit this one.  I like the effortless storyteller stance Tolkien uses - ""Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back again to the evening when he smashed the door. and flew off in a rage two days before."" (starting ""Fire and Water"").  
I'm really curious to know to status of the overarching works (Silmarillion and LoTR) as The Hobbit was written.  I caught many more references this time than I remember ( of course, it's only been a few years since I read the whole history).  The trolls' swords forged in Gondolin.  The brief history of the splintering of the elves (when Thorin gets nabbed by the Elvenking).  And this, from ""Riddles in the Dark"" - ""Who knows how Gollum came by that present, ages ago in the old days when such rings were still at large in the world? Perhaps even the Master who rules them could not have said.""  Finally, in the last chapter, Elrond's prophecy that the Necromancer would not be banished in this age of the world, even after the council of white wizards drove him from Mirkwood.  I suppose I shall, one day, have to read the _History of Middle Earth_ to really tie it all up.

Ender's Game, 2/29/07

I discovered that I can read a cheap paperback while rocking Finn to sleep - that will help!  Another old favorite, well worth revisiting.  This story, for me, is all about the terrific battles.  I know Card has some issues, but he grinds them very little in this one.  Ender is the modern incarnation of the literary superhero, like Sherlock Holmes, who is always just smart enough to stay ahead of his enemies.  I've started Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality ('cause I could reach the first without waking the baby)."

"event","Hmm.  One of the routine things that is no longer routine is shaving.  Frequently, I don't want to block out 10 minutes for buzzing my face and staying smooth.  It's not a big deal, I just shave some other time - being very blonde is a real advantage on that front.  Sadly, the infrequency of shaving has grown longer and longer.  I don't want to grow a beard (which is what I did during the great upheaval and move) but the electric now takes 20 minutes to finish the job.  

Anyway, I've found the solution (at Amazon, of course).  Now I'm curious.  Anyone know why badger hair makes a superior shaving brush?"

<lj-cut text=""V For Vendetta:"">Masked men really belong in the comics.  V's Guy Fawkes mask works great for an instant, but over the course of a scene, it loses the impact, and I just wish I could see the emotion behind the words.   Otherwise, no complaints.  OK, there is a Matrixesque action sequence the seems gratuitous, but really, one gratuitous action sequence is almost quaint.   The W-ski brothers wrote a good adaptation of a dense graphic novel (I re-read it before the movie) and captured the core of the story for the screen.  The topical updating for modern audiences (it was written in the 80's) is subtle and very much in the spirit of the original, I thought.  The movie is less unrelentingly dark than the novel was, but I think that's a good choice for the big screen.  The contrast between complacent life-as-we-know-it and the V the zealot/terrorist/madman is stark.  Evey's transformation rings true, and Portman turns in a good performance (Oscar calibre? that's fanboys gushing...)  My favorite was Stephen Rea as Finch - a wonderful understated character.

in the final analysis, V for Vendetta is a movie both entertaining and thought-provoking.  Subtle?  No, not much, unless you can look between the lines and see how little the fictional Norsefire party has changed from the Neo-Conservative movement that spawned it (that's Margaret Thatcher's movement, BTW.  This movie is about more the Dubya and the Iraq War).  Freedom and Anarchy.  Are you willing to embrace the latter in pursuit of the former?  Responsibility is messy, hard work and fear is ever-present.  There's nothing fictious about that.</lj-cut>"

"event","Hey,

A bunch of stuff came together and I started sleeping much better!

First of all, I went on a hike, about 2.5 hours in briones state park - just up the road from our new place.  Yay!  Exercise, green space, mental dow time.  Some day I'll figure out how to extract photos from my cell phone and I'll show the herd of cows I walked through  I also started just getting up and doing stuff if I didn't fall alseep easily.  Takes my minds off it, or something.  

Contract work?  No, not so much. for embarassing reasons (MySQL/php -nope, not even a little bit, webdevelopment? well, I know about ten HTML tags, does that count?) and regular ones (I don't have a day free, nor will for approximately five to seven years).  I was getting stir crazy, I think, but I don't need more to do, I need more perspective on the things I do.  Does that make sense?

<lj user=""remmer"">, your gaming fusion ideas are mindbending, at least this late at night. ds

I didn't need to go to drugs, but if I do, I'll ask for Ambien first (I assume this is a doctor's presciption kind-a deal).  Of course, I'll have to make an appointment and meet my doctor,, fill out more forms and yada yada yada.  If I have that kind of time, I'll just go for another hike first.  Of course I'll see a doctor eventually... sure I will.

So, it's after eleven, why am I still awake?   I did start ""tightening up"" today, trying to get more done in the day.  Perhaps I just can't do that.  The perspective thing - I start thinking about everything that I'm not doing (not just the housework - that's my job, but correspondence, Dr.'s appt.s, scheduling, comemerating birthdays, paying bills)  Jesus - it's getting worse as I type).  Yeah.  I think I just lost the perspective. 

Did the niggling self-imposed ""obligation"" to follow up in LJ about my insomnia cause me to have a relapse?  Bah, postmodern horsepucky.  Still, I wisk I didn't pick tonight of all night to enzyme my contacts - my glasses suck.    

Eyes tired, brain whirring though.  Perhaps some laundry folding in front of TV well empty my head.

"event","Hi.  It's a little hard to think, so pre-apologies for the scrambled brain.

Yeah, I haven't posted in forever.  I moved (now living in Martinez, home of John Muir and a Shell refinery).   About half of our stuff is still in boxes.  About a third of what's unpacked isn't really well situated yet.  <lj user=""riffraff814""> started a new job which is awesome, but has a commute.  Sam the toddler lost her regular daycare.  But it's been OK. 

I had been making progress on all these fronts - Sam has DC for two mornings a week now, frex.  We have new health insurance, hence new doctors to visit.  Stuff comes out of boxes and moves around most days, or had been.   I've been itchy to do something outside of work, I just didn't think it would happen like this.

You'll remember, my job now is ""homemaker"" - long hours, terrible pay, but the benefits are great.  Sam and I are finding parks to visit, other kids to play with, local restaurants with highchairs and fans, great stuff.

Yep, things were humming along until this week.  This week I started having trouble falling asleep.  Tonight is the third night with very little, and it looks like the latest one yet, note the post time.  I know some of you don't think that's so bad - but Sam's schedule hasn't changed - she still gets up between 5 and 6 am every day.  Holy shit, I'm tired.  

But I can't get down off the crisis mode.  I can't close my eyes and drift off.  Tonight I just decided to put my contacts back in and stop being angry about it.  I'm getting pretty desperate.  I called Sarah to come home early today - Sam missed her afternoon nap and I was worried I was going to lose it.  I tried to go to bed at 8:00.  I tried warm milk.  I drank one of Sarah's beers, for the love of God.   I have to sleep.  I have to finda way to get 6 or 8 hours in a row (well, except for getting up for Sam's change, but that's not the problem).  Tomorrow/Today is Saturday.  Sarah is taking care of Sam, and I'm going to go for a hike - three hours, if I can manage it.  I'm going to get medication.  I'm going to sleep, even if it means taking habit-forming drugs.  I'm worried that I'll snap.  I'm worried that I'll ""adjust"" to being a sleep-deprived zombie and I'll hate life.

OK, thinking is getting hard again.  Time to give the bed another shot.

Sorry, thanks, bleah"

I moved the remaining paper into the supply closet, stacked the day's abandoned print jobs, and logged out from my workstation.  I turned in my keys, filled out the ""exit survey,"" picked up my checks, and left Caltech after seven years.

I admit I did look around my old office for about five minutes, ostensibly to see if I had left anything there, but really because I will miss it - I'm not sure I could do anything for seven years and not miss it, no matter how menial.  Sigh.

And now, shameless predictions:
<lj-cut text=""about the lab"">
In the immediate future, the lab will run out of paper, and probably toner too.  Complaints will be made, and someone will (probably against his wishes) end up becoming the next lab manager.  The printer tables will be overflowing with abandoned documents (they were today, and I was in on Wednesday).  Someone will ask the help desk why something-or-other isn't on the lab machines.  Security (i.e. Ruth-Anne) will recommend a patch or software upgrade and it won't make it to the Windows boxes for a month (Jason was a busy guy - and he doesn't have Alex any more).  Might not *ever* make it to the Macs...

Looking ahead, in January, the lab will move.  It will probably move across Del Mar or Wilson - i.e. far enough that the traditional users won't want to follow it.  Some of Dimitris' crew will pack it up and put it in a new room.  People will be wandering up to Steel 214 in a daze for another month.  The faculty who have been sponging off the lab printers for years will raise a stink, but, since they had two months to read the damn signs, they'll swallow it and buy color printers for themselves.   Somebody else takes over managing the lab, as the user base shrinks and the facility starts looking old.  Finally, probably at the end of 3rd term, the lab is quietly closed and nobody cares - it's just not useful any more.

Fast forward to 2009.  Several groups on campus come independently to IMSS (or whatever its called by then) with problems.   One group wants to run a computer training seminar for summer visitors.   One professor has written a class-specific application for Linux and requires his students to use it, the TAs are trying to find boxes for 50 people in the class who run something else.  Graphic Arts, after years of debate and price fluctuations, decides that they should provide a centrally located printing facility with modestly priced automated print jobs and users get 500 pages (black and white) per term free...  and whadd'ya know, the new lab is greeted with great fanfare and excitement.

Until 2016, when it closes again...
</lj-cut>

As for me?
<lj-cut text=""I'll be fine"">
I'm going to be a homemaker for a while.  I expect that, like any other job, they'll be good days and bad days.  The pay is bad - but not as bad as you think.  Full-time daycare is expensive, as is eating take-out every night.  I'm going to try to balance our budget and build our college fund.  The benefits are excellent.  I'll get to watch Sam grow up and more.  I get to teach her, and learn from her, every day.   I'm a better Daddy than I've ever been anything else.  I'm frightened of all the mistakes I might make, but I know that I've got more motivation to raise Sam than I ever did to run the ITS Lab.   

Sarah is currently looking for work, and already has some prospects.  We've talked about what she needs - a career that supports the family and gives us the financial security we both want.  She's got the tools and the talent, and I'm confident she'll do well.  We also need a place that gives maternity leave, because we'd like Sam to have a sibling some day.
  
I don't know how much free time I'll have, but I think I'll be happier with less.  My exercise will be walking (and running) with Sam, cleaning the house, and maybe a 10-minute home regimen in the mornings.  This month, I'm going to make a stab at <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/"">NaNoWriMo</a> again.  Last time I did it was 2002, and I finished before leaving for Thanksgiving weekend.  Later on, there's the political vision quest, the reading list (like the universe itself, always expanding at an increasing rate) and the new episodes of Justice League Unlimited.

Oh yeah, and work on several RPGs.  I hope to be able to run games again when our kids are in school.  And this whole LJ thing, that too. And religion, and correspondence and...

I thought I'd do the same - though my list is a darn sight shorter.  Little things are good, and I continue to add good stuff to my life, but I still seek the great vision...  looks like I'm not alone.
<lj-cut text=""My list"">
Money matters
There are way too many good causes out there, and the charity money I spend is all over the place - Habitat for Humanity got our Katrina-based contribution.  International Red Cross got one for the tsunami.  
I'm proud to use <a href=""http://workingassets.com/"">Working Assets</a> for my long distance carrier - Sarah brought them into my life.  I regularly kick in a few bucks ""rounding up"" my phone bill and I visit the website for news and opinions several times a week.  I should get my local sevice from them as well, but I haven't priced out the change.
We spend extra money on my electric bill (can't remember how much) to use renewable energy.
A few years ago, I started giving charity as Christmas presents, mostly from <a href=""http://www.heifer.org/"">Heifer International.</a> So far, I haven't started a tradition, but I'll keep trying.  
I'm not very good at spending liberally, but I do boycott Blockbuster (essentially symbolic these days) and McDonald's.  I avoid Wal-Mart, but Target's not much better, and I'm there every few weeks getting something-or-other.  I'm still one of those people who prioritizes by price and convenience first, ""Goodness"" second.  I figure I get some slack because I commute by bike whenever I can, and I do a fair amount of shopping on foot.

News and Perspective
In addition to the Working Assets site above, I visit a blog regularly: <a href=""http://www.thetalentshow.org/"">The Talent Show</a>.  Mostly it's vicarious venting (and reassurance that I'm not the only loony), but once in awhile he brings up something I haven't seen or thought about.
I read wonderful magazine for thoughtful, meaningful investigation of the human condition is <a href=""http://www.thesunmagazine.org/"">The Sun</a>.  No ads, intelligent interviews, gripping and sometimes heart-rending accounts of real life, outside of my limited experience.
I recently joined the LA Post-Carbon mailing list.
And, of course, there's The Daily Show :-)

Activism
In terms of actually getting off my butt and doing something, I'm pathetic.  I should be writing Congress - U.S. and California - frequently - there's always something yucky getting passed.  I'm not well-read on the issues that concern me, and that makes me doubt my ability to take meaningful action.  The biggest problem is time - I can't believe how much free time I had when I was single and alone.  Of course, at that point, I was too depressed by the present to care much about the future.   Progress is grand, ain't it?

Like <lj user=""clynne"">, <lj user=""erich_schneider"">, <lj user=""a_steep_hill"">, <lj user=""riffraff814"">, <lj user=""irilyth""> and others, the aftermath of Katrina has shaken me deeply.  The recovery is proceeding well, with the inevitable hitches and a sadly typical degree of callous profiteering, and I'm starting to see the bigger picture again. 

I want to do something, but I don't know exactly what.  I'm having thoughts, and I think they're worth sharing.  Maybe you can help me focus.  I'll put this behind a cut for now, but if you'd prefer I can put it is a special friends-group-thingy so you don't have to read it.

<lj-cut text=""Long, political and ill-informed"">
I'm not thinking about the next issue, or even the next election, but something more important than anything - my daughter's future.  My father and his father both grew up in a world where he expected his children to have a better life than he did.  I don't expect that.  I expect Sam's life to be harder than mine has been, maybe even terrible, in comparison.  I love Sam more than I thought I could love anyone or anything, and I want to help her.

The time frame is the next 60 years, the prime of Sam's life.  What can I do today to make the next 60 years better?  Ignore the personal stuff, the education and health and love - I know how to do that, I learned from my folks.  It's the state of the world that worries me.  My dad may have been worried about nuclear annihilation, but I'm worried about things more inevitable, more insideous, if not so inherently frightening.

I don't think my daughter is doomed - I still have faith in humanity that we won't see self-inflicted genocide in the next generation.  Instead I predict a radical shift in the world economy driven by peak oil.  I foresee accellerating climate change and the ensuing mass migration.  I see class conflict on every scale, from the street mugger to open warfare.   I see an aging populace with wants and needs far outstripping the desire of the working age to supply them.  I think we may be headed for an age where the population of the Western World, and possibly the world as a whole, will contract - or at least stabilize.   

The historical allegory (which I'm gonna read about, soon) might be the years of the Black Death in Europe and Asia.  I know that the Black Death was, in some ways, the progenitor of the Enlightenment, rational thought, and all that good stuff.  Maybe this dieback will have similar long-range, but that's Sam's kids, Sam's gonna have to live through it.   I want to prepare her for it, and I want to make it as short and painless as possible.

So I recycle and vote Democrat (or Green) and that kind of thing.  It's not helping much, and I vaccillate between trying not to think about it, and cursing my inactivity.  I know I'm not going to drop out of society and live in a commune.  Heck, I'm not even going to give up red meat, probably.  Those little things are good, but that's not going to make much difference in Sam's life (except possibly increase her disconnect with the situation).    I want to be part of something bigger.

I know there's all sorts of organizations addressing individual issues - health care costs, corporate domination of politics, greenhouse emmisions, sustainable energy, etc.  I don't have time or energy to even keep abreast of all these issues individually, let alone help.   I think that's a losing strategy.  You don't see Republicans doing that, and they have (for whatever reason) won the majority of American hearts and minds.  I think I want to be part of a new vision, a great, all-encompassing vision to combat the future I anticipate.

You're a pretty smart bunch of folks, with various levels of activism and various favorite causes.  Have any of you found a grand vision?  Have you looked?  Where?

(a variant on the rule of healthcare: don't get sick)

I gave it to Di-No computing along with a $50 deposit before I left for Milwaukee on August 23rd.  The problem is purely physical - the right hing is cracked, indeed, I played with it for some time with no problems before giving it over.  I still can't get an answer for when it will be fixed.

I admit that I didn't do everything I could to get the problem dealt with expediently - I didn't make it clear to them that I wanted the hinge fixed.  I didn't give them a good contact number for me while I was in MKE, so, yeah, when I got back I had an old message on the answering machine to the effect of:
""Hi this is (some name), and you have a broken hinge.  It will cost (some amount). Let me know.""

I have channeled the rampant stupidity reaction and have made peace with the utter lifelessness that must be working at Di-No computing.  I will not patronise them again, if I can avoid it. Who else services Macs in the Pasadena area?  

So, if I remember, I know how to avoid these problems in the future, using a good contact number, speaking to the staff as if they are semi-autonomous robots instead of service professionals, and trying a different place.  That's for the future.

For the here-and-now, the semi-autonomous robot with which I'm corresponding says they don't have the necessary part, and that it is back-ordered from the manufacturer.  There is no estimate for when this situation might change. I tried another place in the phone book, just for grins, they said ""Our Mac guy is in the field, but he'll call back.""  

I have great reluctance born from being on the other end of far too many irate user rants, but I feel that I must increase the pressure.  I don't attribute any malice to Di No, and indeed the whole situation my be out of their control.  I just want the hinge fixed, or, barring that, to be able to read my damn email again. How best should I proceed?

I have a few thoughts: suggest that they loan me another computer or suggest that they give my machine (and my $50) back until they can fix it, and finally withdraw my business entirely and start over elsewhere a little wiser.  The temptation to ask for a manager and become irate is very strong - but I doubt that would help... well, I might feel momentarily better.

Seriously, the Neitzsche thing only works in your teens and early twenties.  Lately, I'm much more interested in taking a nap then overcoming my weaknesses.  I'm pretty sure that getting up at 4:45am never makes you stronger.  Maybe if you could work out or clean or something... huh? 

On the plus side, gaming last weekend was a blast.  We explored the entire east coast in only five hours -  that's good abstraction, baby. Lots of game time passed though - I should remember to make Artan more stir-crazy next time.  Poor Pat, afflicted with GM's luck in bucketfuls!  

At home, the munchkin still isn't sleeping through the night.  Teething? Hungry? Poor timing, who knows?  It's an annoying cycle of not-quite-good-but-we-survive.  Sarah continues to battle school / work / motherhood / portfolio gamely, despite more trouble on her side of life.  Three^H^H^H^H four birthdays coming up.  All the women in my life are August babies... that must mean something.  I already sent something to Lisa, and Sam isn't even aware of birthdays yet, but the other two I've got to think on a bit. 

Work continues, the state of the lab one small piece of the ITS/ATC merger puzzle.  With typical pessimism, I'm having trouble envisioning the lab surviving the transition.  History, however, teaches us that any change at Caltech takes longer than you're told - so I'm not burning too many brain cells on that yet.  I'm on bonding leave starting Aug. 15, just hanging on until I can get a few days' breather.

"event","A random thought drifting through my brain (while reading <a href=""http://www.thesunmagazine.org/"">The Sun</a>, unsurprisingly) - are movies now a luxury?  For me, personally, it is the time that makes them a luxury, not the money, but the box office slump appears to be a long-term trend.  Ticket prices are going up everywhere, and grosses are falling (especially for lesser movies).  I used to watch a movie in the theaters every two or three weeks, but I could usually catch a matinee, and that cost about $5 - not the $7.50 matinee price you see these days.  I used to be happy to see a good movie twice or more in the theaters, but I can't remember doing that since Titanic (yes, I contributed, I think it's a good movie, sue me).

Movies aren't necessary - but there's a level of economics between food and shelter and a real luxury.  I don't think anyone on this board would call their net access a ""luxury,"" but you wouldn't actually whither and dies without it... I don't think.  

Personally, I think buying new car (being the first owner) is a luxury - you can get good, functional transportation for much less on the used car market.  GM is going to make cars cheaper and make fewer cars to be competitive.  Have movies hit the price point that makes people stop going to the theater and say, ""Maybe I'll buy the DVD instead?"" 
<lj-cut text=""And DVDs are..."">  Even DVD sales are leveling off... not too surprising, after all, how many movies do you intend to rewatch for the rest of your days?  My parents have a big collection of DVDs, they haven't even watched some of them - it's time to stop buying them.  When you buy something twice because you can't remember if you've bought it already, you may be an American consumeroid.

Well, the screw-holes are now covered by another appliance, essentially a fixed metal bridge capping the five implants.  This doesn't come out, but is not flush with my gums either - I can (and should) floss under it daily.  On top of that is a partial - but this is a metal piece with specific docking points for the bridge underneath.  It's very tight, there's a little pain as I pop it in or out.  IT feels big in my mouth - but I suppose anything would.  It doesn't cover my palette like the temporary used to, and it fits very well - if food got caught under this, it would be a real pain, but that shouldn't happen.  My bite is different - I got my tongue four times over lunch.

"event","Tapped by <lj user=""erich_schneider"">.  Thanks a lot.  I feel like a shmuck with this meme.

1. <b>How many books do you own?</b>
Too many I haven't read!  I've tried to stop buying books and use libraries.  As <lj user=""riffraff814""> mentioned, <1000, probably <500.

2.<b> The last book I bought?</b>
Do gifts count?  I bought <i>Out of Gas</i> specifically to give to my Dad.  Silly, I know, he knew everything in it, but I had this idea about getting it signed by the author.  Do TPB's count?  I got myself the collected <i>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> one day when I desperately needed some mind candy.  Last true book for my own reading?  I succumbed to book lust about two years ago, got a Middle Earth collection of stories, <i>Slippage</i> and several others.  I've read the Ellison.

3. <b>The last book you read?</b>
<i>The World of Null-A</i> A. E. van Vogt.  I finished it in less than a week, but still took too long, <lj user=""remmer"">.  I didn't like it much.

4. <b>Five books that mean a lot to you</b>
<i>The Silmarillion ( through LotR) </i> Tolkien created a world, from scratch.  It's not a metaphor for some period of Earth history, it's not derivative, except in that it is a myth, like the essential myths.  That's what I call impressive.  The trilogy is the perfect capstone to the literary edifice, but the amazing thing is the entirety of the myth.  Yes, some day I hope to read all the documentaries about it.
<i>Ender's Game</i> I've read more short sci-fi than novel-length stuff, but Card's little throwaway introduction to <i>Speaker for the Dead</i> is one story that deserves its length.  When they make a movie of it, I'll see it, but I'll hate it with a fanatic passion, because it won't be like I see it in my mind.
<i>Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do</i> Peter McWilliams.  Yeah, it's one-sided, but if you ever feel like the law is treating you like a child, you'll find lots of support for that feeling here.  Outlines an essential problem of this society.  No solutions yet, sadly.
<i>The Crystal Cave</i> Mary Stewart.  Particularly in contrast to Le Morte D'Arthur.  The world is so much more interesting if magic is mysterious and limited, if wizards are fortunate pieces in a larger flow of history.  This series is sort of the anti-LotR, and the root of much of my gaming philosophy.
<i>Watchmen</i> Alan Moore.  I can't resist putting this one in here.  While it might not meet some folks definition of a book, it is certainly a literary work with all the richness and power of a fine novel.   Comics are a medium crippled by their own longevity.  By stepping out of the decades-old characters and the implied limitlessness of the story, Moore tells a wonderful yarn with words and images.  Disturbing, gripping, tender and philosophical.  

5. Tap five people?  No, I think not.  Let my pathetic excuse for literature serve as a endpoint."

"event","Today I went in and got the appliance put on for the first time.  Hey, there are real teeth on it and everything.  There was the requisite scary moment when I got an X-ray to check on one of the implants (apparently I have some inflamed gums. Prescription antibiotic toothpaste will be obtained). The line (the middle of the two teeth) will be adjusted and the hooks will be installed. If (knock on wood) all goes well, I should be done on June 6th.  Sam could beat me to teeth yet..."

"event","<a href=""http://www.freepress.net/news/8120"">Bill Moyers talks about media reform.</a>
That's a far, far better rant than I could write today. I'm starting to think, for real, that the Daily Show does more balanced reporting than the network news.  At least you know when they are making sh^H^H er, stuff up.

If anyone else is starved for alternative views (and you don't want to read any of the blogs and sites that work just fine), get <a href=http://www.thesunmagazine.org/"">a suscription to The Sun</a>.  Just be prepared to be grumpy... a lot."

"event","Sarah and I have been married two years.  We celebrated last night with a quiet dinner at home, splurging on La Luna Negra delivered.  We exchanged minor 2nd year gifts (cotton, thank you very much, not the <a href=""http://www.weddingtips.com/annv.html"">inflated modern list</a>) and had a grand time just hangin' out together.  

This morning, I got my contact lens off the iris and Sarah fished it out.  Then she locked herself out of the apartment and I let her back in. 

It sure is nice to share my life with Sarah."

"event","Yesterday morning was the next step of the fitting.  The healing caps came off, the anchors went on, the partial (still a framework without teeth) snapped over those, and an impression was made. Then everything went back to the way it was.  It still hurts to get stuff screwed on and off the implants - not surprising, I suppose, but still a crummy way to start the week."

"event","I threw out a small relic yesterday - a blue collared shirt.  I've had since it was given to me in 1989.  I was in high school chorus, because back then I had time to do *everything* and the group went on a singing tour around CA.  I missed half of the tour to attend Prefrosh weekend at 'Tech.  

Time and use has finally worn out that shirt, just like it has that eager, limitless youth I was.  It's good to remember, though."

"event","In the teeth saga, today was quick and nearly painless.  The mounting posts got put on and the partail which fits over them was test fitted.  Nothing scary happened, and the dentist appeared pleased with the fit.  The only painful part was replacing the healing caps, which echoed the sensations from the gum-stretching incident, but I handled it without local anaesthesia (which always seems to make things worse later on).  

Inching ever closer."

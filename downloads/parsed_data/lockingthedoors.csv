So I walked up to DQ to borrow James'.

So I'm driving his car for the night.

How fun.

I'm *way* too independent for this, ya know?"

"event","So I'm cranky, I don't feel good, I look like shit today, and my entire torso is extremely burnt from the tanning bed.

All that plus a bad day at school, an empty stomach, a tight wallet (I have $27 to last me for two weeks...yeah right...that'll happen!), and the coldness, and my eye is watering and won't stop. 

And I'm going out to James' house tonight. This is crazy. And my belly button piercing hurts. I changed the jewelry in it and it's a dangly type thing and I keep pulling on it. Ouch. That one's my fault, but whatever. I can still bitch about it....

Well just got off the phone with Satan and he won't be at his apartment until 7 ish or so. That's wonderful. Like I had planned on having awesome sex then discussing everything that's bothering me. Guess that talk won't be happening. 

I'm listening to Nine Inch Nails ""Closer"" over and over and over. I wanna have sex to this song. It'd be extremely sexy.

I'm really hating being in love with James right now. I almost wish I wasn't. And if my patience runs out before we talk, I really will wish I wasn't, and I'll be destroyed. 

Love is the best *and* the worst feeling. By far.

*Maggie*

I <3 James

I miss Jenny.

My soul is crying for so much right now."

[Verse One]
You gave your love to me
When I didn't have a thing to offer you the dreams 
And you believed, and now you think that I'm gon' dip
But I know you aint gon' trip 
Don't act like you don't know just what this is

I can tell when we kiss, when we touch, when we making sweet love
You know this thing is forever
You know the drill keep it real 
Nothing will ever come between us 
And I won't leave you never

[Chorus]
I put that on everything I love 
I put that on my momma, baby you can trust in us 
I put that on everything I own, for all my life I promise 
That you will never be alone 
I put that on everything I am, you gotta understand 
I'll always be your man
I put that on everything I know, I never let you go
'Cause girl I love you so
I put that on:

[Verse Two]
Everything you need, I'll get it for you
A few heads I'll split 'em for you, you know I die for you
And girl you make me whole, you are my sisters soul
And you can try to act like you don't know
But, I can tell when we kiss, when we touch, when we making sweet love
You know this thing is forever
You know the drill keep it real
Nothing will ever come between us 
And I won't leave you never

[Chorus]

[Break down]
Everything I need I got right here with you
You know I'm true
Don't worry baby, I will never leave you
I adore you 

And I put that on everything"

"event","Aww...my entry before the last one was cute. I was talking about James and about how much I like him. 

This entry isn't going to be very long. At least I'm not planning on it. I talked to James last night for about an hour and I asked him if it was all about sex for him and he was like ""Haven't we discussed this already?"" He sounded sort of exasperated, but I realize now, after him explaining it to me again, that he really does like me. He really wants to be with me, we just need some time. He was like, ""Whatever you have to get out of your system, you better get it out now, because after you turn 18, you are committed."" I tried to tell him I don't have anything to get out of my system and I'm definitely not commitment-phobic. It was an adorable little conversation, and I wish I could have recorded that to play it over and over and over again because I'm psycho like that.

Anyways, Jenny, I miss you so much. I must see my Jenny-fur!

I wrote James a one million page letter today. I told him about it. And he was actually excited about getting it. Last time I wrote him a note, I teased him with it and he was like ""You aren't going to tease me again are you?"" It was cute. He's amazing. ;)

Jenny, what do you want for Christmas? Please give me some ideas...I have no clue. And please don't be like everyone else and tell me ""nothing."" I know there is stuff you want. So tell me, damn it!!

My dreams are getting worse. I think it's the stress from everything. I'm extremely stressed and the dreams are getting worse, causing me to get less sleep and to be more stressed. 

And I was just informed by my brother that I take the fun out of everything. Wahoo. Go me. My parents ruined my life, so I get to try and ruin his. That's how it works, right?

*Maggie*




>sigh<


I could so see myself married to this guy Jenny. Is that bad?"

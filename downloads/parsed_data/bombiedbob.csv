I was on the phone at 2 am trying to get ahold of a kaiser advice nurse and she didn't pick up till like 2:50 and then she was like ""Sounds like you're in labor, why don't you take a nap or a shower or <insert more advice here>"" and I was like ""ok"" and it took me a bit, but through the pain I managed to get to sleep because I was soooo fucking tired anyhow. And here I am this morning... no baby."

I'm still not fired and it's making me mad... but I decided that being fired sucks anyhow and that I should quit. I just wish I had gotten that letter from the doctor a few days ago..... damn me. Atleast this way I can make a few more bucks... that way I can pay off my visa AND have a little more money left for gas and things. I've been spending like a mad woman these days. I am really surprised I have as much as I do right now. But... anyhow.... I guess I'll go back to my room now. I've been in bed all day... I'm being lo-pro....

"event","Telling people something and then finding out that they told people you don't even like what you said. Like the big thing thats going on in my life right now. I've told few people, but lord only knows how many people I don't like that they've told already. And the bullshit about it is, everyone would probably pull the same thing christy did on me... ""you didn't tell me not to tell anyone"". Ok, heres the deal with people telling you things- you don't need to tell strangers or people those people hate their business. Just because I told ya something doesn't mean you need to run off to people I don't care about and tell them things you DAMN WELL KNOW I wouldn't particularly care for them to know. I don't fucking care if it's your boyfriend I hate.... he needs not know because I hate him... and it's my business and since I hate him he's not involved in my life let alone my business. Or if it's your friend that I hate... your friend doesn't need to know my business just because you know it. I'd hang up a fucking flyer if I wanted everyone to have the scoop. And as for the asking me if someone else can be told, sure.... as long as I don't hate them. If I like them and they know my business but I haven't gotten around to telling them.... fine. But if I hate them or if I never talk to them, they don't need to know my business just for the sake of someone wanting to move their lips. Gay gay gay. It's my big news and I'd really like to be the one telling it. MINES I SAYS! MINES! If I find out one more person I hate knows my business I'm going to fucking kill."

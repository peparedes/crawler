I have no educational future and as much as I want to believe I have a future to look foward to in general. Everything I've done is for the present time and I have nothing to look foward to. Things that I do look foward to aren't reality there only dreams."

These conversations between us sticks into my head and really makes me think. I really don't know how to react but I guess I'll roll with the punches."

<br>
I've been at my dad's house and his computer is so slow that I barely bother going on it.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm at my mom's house now. I should be with my dad though. He's
going with my sister to darien lake today, and then to see my newest
cousin (she's&nbsp; 2 days old), Jesayda Maria. I&nbsp; didn't want to
drive (or ride in the car) for that long, or sleep over in Buffalo with
my relatives. So, I just stayed home with my mom. Lucky me.<br>

But neopets is fun. I have 2 pets, and 2 petpets. Yeah....

Okay, Blah. Blaaaaaaaaaaaaah."

"event","I spent the night at Arielle's house.  We stayed up until 4:00am then, I didn't wake up until 11:00.  It was fun we watched a lot of Degrassi, there was a marothon on, even though the guide said differently.  It was fun. Then at, like, midnight we put on our swimsuits and got in the jacuzzi.  It was fun, but i was, like half asleep. Oh well."

"event","Hi, I'm Emma.&nbsp;This is my first entry.&nbsp;I am spending the night here @ Arielle's. I will be having nachos for dinner, and we will sleep on the couch and talk, probably until 3:00 am again.&nbsp;Yeah! I am in a good mood because my birthday and party are coming up.&nbsp; I will have lots of people (including Arielle) @ my party.&nbsp;I'll have a lot to talk about after my party. Until then, I shall remain utterly and entirely boring."

"event","Wow the rain finally stopped but not before the flood started around here.
Spent all day trying to help friends move there livestock out of flood water also trying to get them to evacuate there property but they will wait till it is up to the house before they will go.
National guard came in to help evacuate the people in town but I guess they don't think of the country people.
Daughter stuff in storage just under about 15 feet of water poor girl may have to start all over,but daughter and granddaughter safe.I enjoyed the moose thanks."

Your mom is broken. Your dad is broken. Your teacher is broken. Your boss is broken. Your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife/that-person-you-have-a-crush-on - they are broken. 

The jerks who come into work and disregard all my friendly efforts, treating me like an idiot, and less than human- they are broken.

The person who has it together, or who was raised in a ""perfect family"" with ""no problems""- they are broken too. 

""so may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain."" 

I hate the fact that I have caused brokenness. Some of my brokenness is not the result of what I've been through, but what I've put others through. The very thought of how much damage I can bring, how much pain I can (and have) caused, out of selfishness or pride or fear or blatant disregard- it breaks my heart.&nbsp; 

""we are bruised and broken masterpieces, but we did not paint ourselves.""

I am broken, but God is breaking me. If I let the world break me, or satan break me, or myself break me, I will be left in pieces. I will be destroyed. That is why I feel hopeless, and why i despair in my brokenness. But God breaks me so that he might rebuild. He wounds so that he can heal. HE is the rebuilder, not I.

""the world breaks every one, and afterward many are strong in the broken places.""

I want to cry out, to give up, to lay down. But to give in is to remain as I am- broken. I want to be whole.

""when all of the sudden, I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory, and I realize just how beautiful you are and how great your affections are for me""

How he loves us 

oh&nbsp; how he loves us

oh how he loves...."

"event","After giving blood yesterday, I went to Kim's house to go tubing ( despite the warnings- don't go tubing after donating blood ). 
There were two tubes and four people. Things started getting rowdy, and Dan Westerman and I were thrown off of our tube somewhat violently. In a dream like moment underwater, knee met face- and won. We resurfaced and he asked if I was ok. 
""I don't know yet, gimme a second."" I could tell we hit hard, but nothing hurt yet.
""Oh... you're bleeding. A lot.""
The boat returned, and Sarah loveland was the rescuer of the day. She gave me a towel- which I bled all over. Blood doesn't bother me all that much, but her words freaked me out.

""I think you bit all the way through your bottom lip.""

It kind of hurt, but to be honest I was a lot more scared than I was in pain. Dan drove me to urgent care ( I did leave a bit of a bite mark on his knee!).  I definetely bit straight through. The doctor congratulated me. 
 ""You did a nice little number on your lip. Good job!"" 
I really liked that she called me kiddo. It was funny being in urgent care in a bathing suit, shoeless.
Three and a half hours and 5 stitches later, I was back at Kims.

The amazing part is, it's not really that noticable. My lip's just puffy and it's hard to eat. So if you'd like a laugh, take me out to lunch. (Thanks Matt)"

So I did.<br /><br />I ended up hanging out at that gas station for 2 hours. It was so cool seeing life from another perspective- the night shift.

The water was clean and cool, and 6 hours of accumulated dirt was washed away. It was fun swimming fully clothed, I just wish my coworkers would have joined me.

Also amazing: POURING RAIN. I visited Azita at the library (where she works) and she joined me outside for a bit of dancing in the downpour.

Some other great things in life include Cowboy hats (I've got 3!), Motorcycles (my boss has one, he offered me a ride),&nbsp; playing guitar (one morning, sarah was an hour late.

Boy, I can't believe it's only half done. Summer is taking it's lazy old time, and I like it. It's really weird not going anywhere. No vacations, no music festivals, no mission trips or road trips or sailing trips or campouts that last longer than a weekend. Meanwhile, everyone else IS doing all of these things, and I am at home enjoying each time a group of friends arrives back from their various locations.

It's really neat to be here, and to enjoy those who are here with me. No matter how many people leave at one time, there are always plenty who stay. These people are SO COOL! I love the opportunity to get to know individuals more personally, because I am forced NOT to spend time with the people I usually do. Not that I don't love them.

So, let me list some advantages to my circumstance:

1. Summer never seems to end
2. I have a crapload of unscheduled time
3. I'm not going to miss the Ann Arbor art fair
4. I'm coming to know and appreciate a lot of new people
5. Every time someone arrives back I realize how much I missed them, and how important they are too me. 
It's an endless celebration!

"event","Mary and I were talking about what it means to hunger for God, and what it means to thirst for God.

When you're thirsty, your body doesn't necessarily need food. When you're thirsty, you'll eventually get dehydrated. Though you will feel weak, it's a different kind of weakness than the weakness felt when hungry.

I want to hear what everyone has to say about hungering for God versus thirsting for God.

It seemed to Mary and I that thirsting for God has more to do with the Holy spirit, and with a personal relationship with God. The part of your relationship that is one on one and intimate, that doesn't involve fellowship with other Christians or evangelism or anything like that. It requires listening to God. Being silent WITH him. Spending time alone with him. 

It's like meditation that they do in Yoga, when you clear your mind of all thoughts. Clear your mind of every thought, plan, opinion, decision, concern, fear, doubt.... clear your mind of every thought except God's love. Not even what he did, or how glorious he is. Just his love. And wait on God. Don't rush his timing. He is never late.

Mary and I laughed when we looked up on her desk to see the title of an unread book: Thirsting for God."

I went to a loverly wedding reception Saturday with Joan Wolfe, and we didn't know anyone AT ALL including bride and groom.

We blew bubbles and danced (no one else danced), we met a southern gentleman in a seer sucker suit with a hat and crazy sideburns. We did the dishes. We got paid a lot.

Joan and I drove to Azitas where we spent the night. We dressed Azita in middle eastern clothing while she was on the phone, toasted marshmallows over the stove, drank persian tea from a Russian kettle, watched the Rocky Horror Picture Show, went swimming at about 2:00 a.m, adventured (sopping wet) to Meijer to buy some cake mix, and finally went to sleep.

We were discussing Baba Yaga (cannibalistic witch who lives in a hut with chicken legs), and trying to figure out where the story originated.

We got off at 1:30 instead of 4:30, and I had such a great time bonding with everyone in the sunnnshine...

Here's the rundown: Charles (a large black christian minister/ my boss) and his sister Marcy do the administrative stuff. Jimmy (a 31 year old adam plomaritas with a mowhawk) and Sarah (a 35 year old former paramedic) have worked here for a couple of months. Emily (29 year old graphic designer), T.K. (just graduated from pioneer) and I all started on monday. 7 of us total. Usually 5 of us working. We get along so well! Which is good, because we spend hours together daily, and we have to cram all of us in a car to drive to each job site.

Alright, I need that tattooed  on myself so I don't forget. 

So, the big exciting news: On Tuesday, God told me to quit my job at the mall. I was thrilled, because I have not been a big fan of this job. However, I also came up with a lot of reasons why quitting would be a bad idea, particularly because I didn't have another job lined up despite numerous efforts. I quit last night at the beginning (as God directed). It was a good thing, because by the end of the night I probably would have changed my mind. 

This morning, I got a job! Literally... the next day. It's a landscaping job, and I'm aware that it's a ""sucky job"" (that's what my new boss told me, haha), but it's gonna be sweet!

One moment everything is straightforward. I trust God, I feel secure, and I see clearly.

The next moment my vision begins to blur as obstacles pile up. Dentist appointment. Too many cavities. Too many appointments to come. Too much money.

My mind becomes a beehive of activity, as I realize that I'll probably be getting a new job soon. So how can I make a half dozen appointments? Yet the solution to this money deficiency lies in a job. And I don't want to come back to this office! It makes me feel nauseous. Then I discover that my bike tire popped while I was in the appointment. Dissappointment. Frustration. 

I'm working tonight. I complain about work a lot, but God gave me peace about it. With the flat tire and the dentist, I start feeling nervous and stop trusting God. Like walking on a tightrope, suddenly I'm grasping for anything even mildly secure. I look down. I take my eyes off of the goal.

The girls had gone upstairs to talk. I was left downstairs with four boys who were entertaining themselves with the retractable cord on a small vacuum cleaner. A boy we will call **** pretended to worship the vacuum cleaner. I wasn't too surprised by this, but then the others joined in. It kind of weirded me out, but I laughed anyways. Next thing I knew, they were coming at me, dragging me off the couch, and one of them was holding a drill (turned on) over my face. It was terrifying.

My hands and feet were soon bound with duct tape. They set to work, moving the couch, propping up an easy chair, setting a drum stool on top of this furniture (draped in a red blanket), and atop it all they set the vacuum cleaner. I was carried onto the sofa, directly beneath the vacuum cleaner on its precarious pedestal.

As they bowed down to the vacuum, one called ""the dark one"" fell out of rythm from the rest. They nearly sacrificed him too. A boy called ""high priestess"" stood up at intervals, silencing the other three with a wave of his hand. In a very forboding voice, he read the warnings against use of a vacuum cleaner outside. The worship intensified.

At the most intense moment, when the drill was held close to my face (SOOOO CLOSE) once more, the girls came down the stairs to my rescue."

Well, they were wrong, but I don't regret a thing. Two months ago I was sitting in the courtyard at our school. God showed me all of the awesome things he had done in the time that I was in high school. I prayed that the next two months would be the most productive 2 months of my highschool experience. I daresay they have been. It's certainly been eye-opening.

It's been like biking up hill. and I felt like I was just getting more and more tired the closer I got to the top. Now that I'm so close, I'm giddy with excitement and exhaustion is just irrelevant. I didn't sleep all last night. It's swell. I'll probably crash later, but that's totally cool with me. I'm just really happy to be alive, and I'm so glad for what God is doing right now.

I'm extremely excited for Mission Christ. I love having the Richard guys there, like Westy, Macari and Fonz. I love having Dave Williamson and Megan Clark back. I love that Robin is a Christian now! I love how Mark feels high when he's serving people, (giving rides, vacuuming, whatever). He literally feels like he's on drugs.

Last night I was feeling fo' crappity, and it was no good. After dinner, I decided to go for a walk. I didn't realize that it was raining until I got outside, but I didn't bother to change. I just kept on walking, and strolled through the woods. I was singing about God's faithfulness, and the thunder kept getting louder. I was singing along with thunder! I had to belt it out to be heard. It was sweet.

When I got to the middle of the forest, I was singing Kim Weezy's song about the Walk to Emaus. I had this sudden and overwhelming urge to dance. Usually I resist those urges since I can't dance anythign besides the charleston. But being alone in a huge forest surrounded by enormous trees and all the glory of God, there was nothing to hold me back, and everything urging me on to worship in this way. So I just started dancing and singing, and there was such freedom!

I really enjoyed all the different senses God has given us. I could hear the thunder, the rain, and the birds. I could feel the warm mud and leaves on my feet, and water dripping off my face, becoming warm as it ran down my arms. I could smell the rain and the flowering trees (such a beautiful smell!). I could see BRIGHT green leaves against dark wet trunks, towering oaks, dark gray clouds and red flashes of lightning, the forest glowing from the ground up. I could even taste the rain! It was sweet on my lips.

The rain became so heavy that puddles formed in an instant, and I started to run, splashing and dancing some more, rejoicing... thinking of Rina. 

I walked all the way to the neighborhood across the street, and stood beside the pond. It was such a beautiful feeling, being soaked to the skin and knowing God's presence is in every rain drop.

Today I found out that Kim Wiesner did the same thing. http://foggyandfriends.livejournal.com/5392.html"

Naps are awesome, even for 10 or 15 minutes. I took two today, one during AP english and one on the couch. Though they were short, they did precisely what was needed. A nap for me is like rebooting the computer. It's a reset button, which places all of my thoughts and feelings and attitudes and perceptions on shuffle. That way, when I wake up I can begin again what had seemed stale before.

Here is a very good way to pursue peace when you feel unpeaceful or stressed. Stop whatever you're doing. Make some tea. Turn on beautiful soothing music like sigur ros. Read the psalms. Do it outside if it's warm enough. Put every other thought out of your mind. Rest in God, and stay there until you have allowed God to have control of your mind, thoughts, and life once more."

I was praying last night, ""God, when are things going to get easier? When am I going to stop feeling attacked, tired, and weak? When will this season end?"" And then I realized how incredibly close I've come to God through all of it, how much I've gotten to know him, and how I've finally begun to depend on him. So I changed my prayer. ""God, do whatever it takes to keep bringing me closer to you.""

Sometimes my priorities are wack. I'm working on it though.

Sooo I'm on the hunt for a job, and an awesome opportunity recently arose.
I was at Value World (a wonderful used clothing store which I frequent) and I saw a sign on the door: ""Now hiring. Talk to Bob for an application.""
I thought to myself, ""What a perfect opportunity!""
As I approached Bob, he said to me ""Why don't you just get a job here? You'll get half off of all your purchases, and I know you need that. I see you here all the time."" I replied that I had hoped to do so, and asked for an application. Everything seemed perfect, the job, the hours, the other employees, the half off- but my hopes were shattered when he asked, ""How old are you?""
Lousy lousy seventeen. I guess there was some law suit... now they can't hire anyone under 18. I won't be 18 until fall! AGH! He told me to tell all my friends, but continued to say ""It's a shame. This job would be perfect for you. You're one of those people who just drips Value World.""

In short, God loves me and has a wonderful plan for my life. I can't wait to find out his plans for my summer job! (Maybe he doesn't want me to have one? That would be interesting.)"

I'm very happy with what I've seen of Livejournal- which is to say, I'm very happy with how my friends are using it. I'm so encouraged when I hear what God is doing in people's lives, or that someone else is going through the same things that I am. I'm amazed by the ways that God is using Livejournal. I see real community in the encouragement, support, and prayer that people offer up to each other. It's wonderful to have a place where people can be open and honest without the complications of ""bringing it up in conversation.""

GOd thank you for all the opportunities you have given us. Thank you for the awesome community you have built up, and all the ways that I can see it. At school and at church and online and everywhere I am, I see this community you have built, and I see your kingdom coming.

Extracted from a song:

Answer me when I call to you oh my righteous God
Give me relief from my distress
be merciful to me and hear my prayer

How long  oh men 
will you turn my glory into shame?
How long will you love delusions
and seek false Gods?

Know that the Lord has set apart the Godly for himself

In your anger do not sin
when you are in your bed, 
search your heart 
and be silent.

Offer right sacrifices and trust in the Lord

Let the light of your face shine upon us oh lord
You have filled my heart with greater joy
Than when grain and new wine abounds

I will lie down and sleep in peace
for you alone, you alone oh Lord
make me dwell in safety.
Dwell in safety.



(Funny thing- I was going to write about how I feel like crap because of all that I have to do and all that's going wrong and the things that I'm anxious and afraid about. I don't feel that way anymore though.)"

"event","Cb was yesterday and it was awesome. well actually it wasnt what i thought it was going to be at all. it was exactly like a middle school dance except everyone was pretty. also i think there was less drama there than what there was in middle school. the trio had a good time and i think our dates did as well. wil was ready to get out of there. haha. oh the torture one can put another through just by dragging them to a school function. muhaha!!! everyone looked pretty so that was really cool. 

so the day started off as i had to get my hair done around 12. when i went to get it done, there was this bride and her two best friends getting there hair done for the girls wedding and they reminded me so much of me cait and jules it was even funny. actually it was. so they were my entertainment for that part of my day.

next thing i went home and tried as much as possible not to mess up my hair so i cleaned my room so cait and julie wouldnt have to sleep in the junk on my floor.

and the next few hours were the longest hours of my life...

and then i put my dress and stuff on and wil came over with mom and dad and video camera. soo we took a bunch of akward pictures that moms must have...yeah that was torture. then our parents got to know eachother while we both wanted to run off and play in the middle of the road or with something having to do with fire. yeah.

then off we went. got there. got pictures. danced. all that good stuff.

then came limo time...it was awesome. Pargo's was good.

$35.69 was how much me and wil's dinner cost. $5 of that was what mine cost. haha.

and then more limo time....


and they lived happily ever after. sort of."

"event","""Whoaaa!!!!! Jaybles, that whole rant was totally ripped from my mind. My thoughts exactly, as they say. I believe that this year is definitely The Year of the Trio. That's it, kids."" -Caitlyn D. Uer ladies and gents. Yeah well i havent really written anything in here in a long time so i thought it was about time to do some updating. So the year of the Trio, sounds good indeed. It really hasnt been all about the trio this year, but its been pretty darn close. every yeah we say the same thing, ""this year it will be just us girls...no one else."" now we dont say that to be mean or leave others out of our lives but we always just wanted a year with just three best friends and no drama between them. yeah right. this year has been pretty good so far. We have had our crushes and our enemies and also some that were of both. But overall i must say this has been pretty good. i should probably hold my tounge cause im sure something will come up. Cb hopefully will be great. There are many things running through my mind when i think about Cb and what will come of it, who knows and who cares. To change to a happier note im glad i know someone who has realized some things before i had time to. We both went through the same thing. Almost Exactly the same thing. weird. Anyway but its doing a lot of good for this person, as it did for me. Thanks cause I am still learning from you.

"event","yesterday was a drag. i dont really have any idea why, just the day was really bad. night turned out to be a little worse, but then got better. school was alright, i have had better days in that department. then came after school, which was awesome. me, julie, val, and ben all road to wendy's with nikki and then she left to go to the bank and matt showed up in the ""stang"" and we all road around with him for awhile. but before that we attacked him in the parking lot. he has grown up a lot. not that he was immature or anything before but he is now an adult and not some high school kid anymore, which is weird, but cool...i mean dairy(we are trying to replace the word cool with ""dairy"", i dont know, ask matt about it). anywho we raod around with matt for awhile and then he took us up to the h.s. so we could get ready for the game. ugh. i wasnt all that excited, i knew we were going to lose. anyways we got ready for the game and it seemed the entire band was in a melancholy mood. including me, and i really didnt seem to have a reason to be i just felt that way. sooo matt and nikki were at the game and that was awesome cause i love those kids. but yeah the game was bad for many more reasons than our team sucked that night. aww man i was ready to cry...blah. but yeah after the game we went to nikki's and matt and amanda were there and they stayed until about 2:30-3ish in the morning and then went home. i came home about 11 today and i stil dont feel myself, hopefully the billy wayne/soul divine concert will cheer me up.

"event","well school, thats one we could start with. so far its been pretty good. i like all my classes. last year i hated most of my classes but i loved band, thats what kept me going. it seems the year those two have switched roles. i never thought that would happen. i miss matt and nikki like you wouldnt believe and at the start of summer practices i was so excited about the freshmen comming because for some stupid reason i thought it would be like it was in 8th grade, well i was wrong. we all have grown up at different speeds which i saw that comming but now i hate it. things have changed and i dont think they will ever be the same. i am going crazy because of this whole concert band thing, i havent played flute but like four times this summer because of marching band and now that i have to play it...i suck, plain and simple. the only reason it bothers me is because its been something i have been doing since 4th grade, and no the 4th graders can most likely play better than me. ugh. ok im done with that. like i said not everything is bad, school is awesome so far and i never thought i would see the day when i actually thought that. but band...well....no comment. i would rather do spanish than play flute. let me tell you that is bad....REALLY BAD! ohh last nights game was lame...we lost. peter falling on his face on the bus made it worth the 2 hour and 45 minute drive. because we lost wasnt the only reason it was a bad game...julie knows what i am talking about. lets just say when you think you know what you want, you have no idea."

"event","I took that from Lauren's journal so I could work off of it in mine. Thanks buddy. When I was reading Lepa's entry about wishing your life away, im sure that I have done this several times, I couldn't help but think that someday instead of Meghan standing up there saying that, it could very well be me saying the same thing. I remember sitting in the circle last year and thinking ""Yeah I have a long time before I ever have to say anything like that."" Really...I don't. It hasn't hit me until this year that I am going to have to get a job and grow up. Ugh. The thing that made me realize it most was Matt and Nikki are in college. The senior speeches for some reason set me off this year thinking about all this.

"event","yeah i came back from band camp this week and it was awesome like always. we got through our show and it is alright this year...it was ten times better last year but im ok with that. its weird cause matt and nikki arent there, well together, nikki was there but she was staff ??what fun is that?? but she hung out in our cabin all the time so it was like she was one of us again. but i miss this always being around. i love them both very much. tear tear. anywho me ju ju and cait cait all had to be there early cause our parents are officers for the band and julie had to ride with me so we got first pick for rooms which was cool cause we picked the one we had the year before. but then  mix up happened and we ended up moving into a bigger room with me julie cait lepa hannah alicia and val. so it was all good after we moved in. we all worked our butts off and were really tired but we had fun while doing it all. ohh yeah and we had peter and kyle and the younger boys there like it used to be. kyle is a sweetheart...and thats all that needs to be said there. we did lots of things that normally would get you in trouble bt we had an awesome counsler...mrs. fox. haha she loved us. a few things we did was kill a bat, line the stairs with mattresses and go down on them in tubs and sleeping bags, steal posters and cover them with duct tape (uhh no comment as of what was on the posters) and lots of other fun things. ohh so many memeories...the bat was deff. the best though, we didnt mean to kill it. there is a really really long story behinde that one...whooohah.


went to micheal w. smith and mercy me concert last night and didnt really like either of them. i loved the opener band though...DAVID CROWDER BAND IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!

"event","soo we had another Hitchcock'n night at Val's last night which was awesome like always but this time it wasnt hitchcock movies we were watching...instead it was Tom Hank's movies, we only got through one and started one the next morning. Our first one was the green mile which is really sad yet funny at times but mostly sad. When i first got to vals i was the only one there so we had to wait on nikki and cait cait to show up sometime. so 20 mintues later nikki shows up and we start to tell her we dont like her and she smells you know like we always do. anyways cait shows up some time after that and when she comes into the room she picks up this shirt that val had ty-dyed(uhh spelling??) anyways she picks up this shirt and was like ""Val are you going to wear this?"" and val was like ""yeah why?"" and cait says ""because it looks small"" and then we all died of laughter. ohh man cait cait good one. anyways like two seconds later cait tells val that her legs are hairy...one more point for cait. you can say it was an interesting night. then after that we decided to play chinese checkers which i have never played before but it was anyways. so we played that on her deck behinde her house and turned dave up really loud so all of waynesburg could hear it. so we are playing chinese checkers and her dog comes up and licks my hand (by the way it is pitch black outside and we are playing with candles) and i screamed at the top of my lungs. scary. soo after that was over we decided to watch the movies. the next day val made us waffles. she is so nice to us. even though they came out of the freezer they were the best i ever had. indeed.

OOh wait Liz Gruber from camp called me, she is an awesome kid who happens to have a hott brother even though he is like 19...but it's a running joke that i am his stalker..or is it a joke?? haha umm no. band camp is also right arond the corner and i cants wait for that because i mean whats better than a bunch of hot and sweaty band kids killing eachother yet also loving eachother?? wait i know something better than that...my bad. i had a really funny convo with lauren today here is some of it: </P>

AAHHHHHHH!! i am so aggrevated with learning this music and the fact that i am slacking on the other instrument i play. BAH! i dont know. anyways that is why i am a little testy at the moment because i cant seem to be able to play small simple things like certain high notes and the scales perfectly...I MEAN COME ON THEY ARE SCALES! sorry again for my complaining but considering we dont really have the 30 peice brass section that would be nice i need to be able to play everything...i mean our section is really good so they dont need me screwing it up. yeah that was my venting about band...
ohh yeah i decided to take spainish this year rather than russian...because izminger is teaching this year. wooohooo! i just hope i can request having him.

"event","today was the first day of band for everyone together...cause before today they had the freshmen practices but not everyone went to those hence the name, anyways it was pretty good and everything blew over pretty well and no one died which was something i was predicting because someone always gets ticked off at some point. but like i said it went over pretty well besides that i was really mad at myself for not being able to play as well i would have liked, it really wasnt that i couldnt play i was forgetting fingerings and little things like that and schaffer knows when you forget something and my entire section was doing it. but other than that we all played well and it wasnt completely a reck. i dont think this years field show comes anywhere close to last years though...last years was a hard one to learn. when we were do marching fundamentals we got really cool group to teach...the only freshmen in it were Vanessa Edgar and Sarah Walko and they already could march fine but as every freshmen experiences sideways and backwards marching will come in time lol. but they were really nice and seemed to understand what we were saying so that was awesome. i really like those kids. anyways yesterday i went to vals and hung out with her and nikki...well more val cause nikki had to work til some time or another. me and val found it very humorous to look at some girls infos and make fun of them because they are so freaking stupid... but yeah we got some good insiders with that one...such as: ""Holy Poo!!! Val we have some many memz rember all the detiontions we got??? OMGGGGGGG!!!"" and yes all the spelling errors are suppose to be there....yeah great times with those two. Oh another band story is that i am married to ben phipps yet again...for like the tenth time, he is awesome as well. also i look for a few freshmen to drop band on account they were not pleased at all being there today. but you win some lose some..."

"event","yesterday i didnt really have anything to do and nikki thought she would take pity on me and invite me to carps party...even though she claimed that he told everyone at dave that we were all invited..uhh dont remember that but anyways i decided that nikki didnt have to many friends so i thought me and val would be nice and go with her, i lied nikki has lots of friends, anyways so i met her at vals around one and we hung out there for while and burned some cds and then we went to carps. i love carps family they are so freaking nice all the time and they didnt even know me so that says something about how nice they are. so we were mingling with the crowd and everyone decides to go swimming because it was too hott to do anything (we attempted to play volleyball and badmitten but it was to hott) so we didnt want to swim, one because we didnt have bathing suites and two we didnt want to embarass ourselves in front of all the buff guys that carp has made friends with...so needless to say we didnt make it into the pond where they were swimming so we just sat and watched. then we got this bright idea that we would go to Wal-mart and see if we could find Matt because he was working that day. so the time is about 4 ish so nikki says we have time to get there before he gets off at 5. so we say our goodbyes to carp and whatnot and head out on a search for matthew rogers. so we get to wal-mart at about 4:45 and we look for matt inside and look for his car in the parking lot...no luck. so we give up and go to my house where nikki and val meet my parents and put up with them until we ate dinner which it was the first time val ate deer meat and she liked it! haha had to laugh at her when she found out what it was...so after we ate at my house and hung out for awhile we went off to pick up matt at his house to go bowling. the same time we were going bowling amanda and her friends were there...but matt didnt go with them...he came with us ?????? i dont know. so we all bowled together and i sucked. my team was nikki val and lindsey. the other team was matt amanda and her two friends cali and umm some kid who was really hott and everyone thought so. i feel bad i dont remeber his name. sorry but whoever you were you were hott!!!! so that was my day....ohh yeah and turns out matt saw us comming back from wal-mart...he sucks...ohh yeah and there are two men working as cashiers at wal-mart...matt and a gay guy. hah.

"event","well i am getting ready for a party at the Bailey Household in about an hour...i get to see the baby cousin which i have only heard about so it will be awesome. There will most likely be free food which is always a plus in my book. Summer seems have had died down a lot after dave because everyone needs to do the ""family"" at one time or another. Band starts next week and im not so sure how that is going to blow over. this year is the first year mason is completely in charge from begining to end. i think he needs to be a little harder on us just because we really have never seen that side of him and i think it would be a good start to people showing up more often and taking this seriously. me and julie were listening to her moms record of her band concert when she was in high school and gene cappilline (spell check) ran the show. they were amazing and i know if mason hears one more time that ""when gene ran the show the band was great!!"" he is going to have a heart attack on the spot. well there is always hope that shcaffer will be the bad cop if mason plans on playing good cop this year. i hope he chooses to play a little of both sides. but i mean i cant imagine all the things he goes through with this band so i guess i dont have anywhere to say anything about the way things are ran. who knows what will happen...hopefully its good though whatever it is....i dont think haleem would let his feild show be anything less than wonderful though which is awesome..that man is amazing. period.

"event","yeah again that was dave....my quote i mean as opposed to what you might have thought it was, which i dont know what you thought it was...anyways, i made it to NY alright the car ride was a bust and it was sooooo long...8 hours....in a car...with my uncle scott which he is cool and all but there isnt much convo there. Well i reached NY at about 6pm ish and went to one of my cousins (randy which is who i am staying with) friends house for dinner. Now i always wondered what it would be like to eat with a massive italian family and lets say i got the full experience. they have six kids of their own...and then there are the many aunts and uncles and gradfathers and grandmothers and whatnot. So i am eating with this big italian family...and actually i dont know if they are italian i was guessing that by their name...and the way the cook, but anyways so i am eating with this family and then they start to talk about stories about when my mom was around sixteen and used to come up here and stay, and they had crushes on her. well lets not talk about that convo, i really didnt want to hear it. at all. so after we were done eating one of the kids who ""knows"" my mom comes up to me and starts telling jokes and whatever (i took him as the jokester of the bunch) and while he is telling me these jokes he is kissing his dog named, yeah no kidding, named ""pooper."" he is in love with his dog. it looks like a bat. its about the size of a bat actually. they call this kid pick boy. why you ask? well he looks like the guy off of nickelodian (spell check please) who pick the day time cartoons and who wears the suite that looks like robin off of batman...yeah that is pickboy. well you could say that dinner was interesting. ohh yea and not that you care but people seem to be way different here as opposed to home. example: during this dinner one of the kids, a 14 year old girl, who was dressed well rather...undressed i should say...well she had her bf over for dinner...and they acted as if they were married...and no one seemed to care about it...uhh sure. I also learned a new word today...NY style:

Fresh (verb)- meaning ""bad""; ""untasteful""; use in a sentence: ""Stop screaming...dont be fresh.""

i will continue with my NY stories later haha

It was cool for the little kids but me and julie would have rather went shopping, dont get me wrong we really arent girly but it was gross, and the cows were gross....dirt is cool but cattle, im no so sure about that one. Lets just say there is a reason why we didnt take Ag Ed. There were some cute babies there though, cows i mean not children, which they were cleaner and nicer than the mom cows they were evil. The little kids seemed to get a kick out of being there and that was our goal so overall it wasnt too bad. Oh yeah and at the end of the tour we got free ice cream and i mean come on who can agrue with that? 

Things with the trio seem to be better a little bit which is totally awesome...not just partcially but totally! yeah we always will have our rough spots here and there but every friendship does and it would be unhealthy if we didnt. I think once Dave comes around we all will be much happier...who wouldnt? yeah DAVID J. MATTHEWS CONCERT!!!!! we have been waiting two months for this baby and it is next week!!!! SCORE!


ohh yeah and the trio is going to church camp together which is awesome cause we are KP's aka being lazy the whole time and can do whatever we want! CHYEAH!!

I could start this entry off as something that appertains to the recent buzz about love vs. lust which i think i babbled about it my last entry. Im gald that Julia had brought that up cause it seems to have had some effect on other people which i think this whole journal thing should be about. Ohh yeah and thanks Lauren for saying I was intelligent. Actually that brings up something that has been a problem lately with some close friends of mine, which i really have yet to take part in this, well, i dont really know what to call it...but anyways it seems to be more of a battle between those two and doesnt really include me, which dont get me i DONT feel left out, its just something i have learned to overlook and act as if it is just their nature to be like that which all three of us have something that makes the other two annoyed but this has built up over the years and is not only affecting us but people outside of this ""group of friends."" I have been a victim to this sort of treatment and yes i know its not a pleasant feeling but this seems to be something that makes this person either feel better about themselves or something they use to make people realize something about themselves. Im not really sure which one they do this for but there are other reasons i can think of but those two seem to be the most mild ones so those are the ones i will talk about. Im not writing to cheese anyone off but this is going to become a bigger problem and its not something we can come out and directly say ""this is what is happening and this is how you can fix it.."" we cant say that because in a way we would be letting you win again because the problem kinda resides in realizing what you do wrong and admitting it but there is more than that to it. As much as you would like to think that you are better than anyone in anyway you need to realize that in thinking that you bring on some hostile opponents who do anything in their power to stop those thoughts. now i could be completely off base from what the real problem is with you but as i see and speaking from personal experience with the comments and knocking down of everything i cant see why else you would say things to another person as mean as they seem to be. Being blunt to people isnt what people need to hear im sorry but its not. Its painful. Im not saying that i have never said anything mean to someone and that i am perfect and i am better than anyone else all i am saying is that this has become a problem and you have upset so many people by what you have said including me so i am telling you as a friend to sit back and think about it and if you cant realize what you did wrong then i suggest you lay back on some comments and personal thoughts about people should stay PERSONAL! I cant really state much more about it because as i said i would be giving you the solution and thats not what needs to happen. SORRY if i have offended you in anyway, SORRY if any of this seems to have come out of nowhere, SORRY if you dont believe i am intelligent enough to be telling you about this because if you need someone intelligent enough i know a girl who would love to, SORRY if i am way off base but this is how i see it a lot of times, and SORRY for making a big hairy deal about it but im tired of seeing people hurt because of the things you say.                  ....now if there wanst enough hints in that than there is no hope for this....



This journal entry was made for me and my close friends and to help resolve something that has been quite the complication for some time so as I said dont get me wrong, I am not a perfect person saying i have never hurt anyones feelings and I hope you dont get the wrong message by this but this is something purely for me and my two closet friends....something im not sure you will understand unless you have been there and seen it all go down.

"event","I just was reading someone else's journal and this someone is rather close to me and she is someone i really respect...a lot. As I was reading this entry it dawned on me, well this is most definitly not the first time this has happend, but it dawned on me that I am a sucker for romance. I mean im not dependent on having a boyfriend for survival like some i know but I think I have, well had I no longer have, the whole ""looking for someone to fill the void"" syndrom. When i say i HAD it i actually mean that. I dont think I had it as bad as some people seem to but it was a mild case, i think we have all had it at some point in time and we all have seemed to deal with it differently. Some of us go out and find someone random to date who we really dont even know and claim to be in LOVE with them. During these LUST relationships a lot of things happen that we later regret. Other people turn to friends for support and they joke around about things and it helps it blow over a little bit (this is a rather useful method). But sadly most of us choose the dating someone random whom they've never really got to know all that well yet it seems perfect at first and then later on things start to blow up in your face because you never got to know them and they ARE NOT what you thought they were. things become painful and hard. then the relationship ends and you move on to someone else. SO WHATS THE POINT?? i honestly dont understand why people do it but i mean i have experienced it as well as most people have. LUST vs. LOVE? that seems to be a wonderful journal topic. sorry about being so random about everything in here but as i said its 10:30 in the morning and something was bothering me. and yes dont get me dating is wonderful but i think we should tone it down a bit...well a lot. but thats my opion and dont take any of this to offense but speaking from someone who has experienced it very well its not the most wonderful thing after all. 


sorry about the babbling about it...im not judging anyone, and like i said i have been through this so im not a perfect person writing something about someone else i know who has done any of this...personal experience, thats about it. personal opion.

"event","Sunday I went to Kennywood with Kurtis and Jules and it was awesome, well kennywood is kinda lame after about the 10th time you have been there but kurtis and jules made it fun. the entire time we picked on kurtis and he did the same back to us so you can say it made for an interesting car ride. Ohh yeah and his parents love us, well i think anyways, but kurtis has to move out cause we are moving in...even though we will have to redo the whole Barbie theme in his room, yeah that was sooo last year...The Little Mermaid is in! Anyways it was pretty cool overall. And I mean everyone always needs a set of adoptive parents...and since the Ammons family movied away we had to find a new one. even though mommy ammons hated us i do believe. but who cares.

Me and Jules are helping my mom teach at VBS this year, which is cool cause we have the little kids who are easily amused by shiny things so it doesnt take much to hold their attention. I like kids when they arent screaming at you. haha like Stewart off of mad tv, ohh funny stuff there. I never went to a Bible school class til I was older, which i wish i would have had went to something like this as a child cause it's really cool and sometimes you can see them understanding the point of it...and other times they just scream for snack, but like i said sometimes they get it, which is awesome!



there seems to be some major tension between some good pals of mine. I mean sometimes i am involved in the tension but i have learned to ignore it and to try not to let it build up to something that could mean a major fight between these pals. when you spend everyday with someone im sure you wil find something about them that really cheeses you off a lot but you sort of learn to look past it a few times, but then after awhile it does build up, and i think this one has about reached its limit. I wish there was something i coud do to make it all better...like some comic relief would work for this one...i doubt it. Maybe what we need is a screaming battle....i dont want that but if thats what it is going to take then so be it....and i feel it comming on...soon.

"event","Have you ever been in one of those moods where you have no idea what's going on in your life...it's like you are watching it all go on but really aren't taking any part in it?  I dont know if i am in one of those moods or if i am really unsure of myself right now. it all kind of goes back to the whole ""seeing what you want yet there is always that fog there to hide it"" thing, which is not a wonderful thing to expirence. I see a lot of other people, particually one, who can move things along rather easily, which is a good trait to have at times but at other times they are unaware of what they are buying and dont spend enough time shopping...hows that for analogies?? anyways that persons life kinda makes me wonder what i was thinking becoming a part of it. Well that was almost a dead give away of who it is. Alright im a little off track now so i will pick up somewhere randomly...ohh yeah i had a wonderful (sarcasm) convo with an old pal today and im not worried about protecting his identity...eric wayne morton...he never ceases to cheese me off. Im sure you could guess what that was all about....and I quote ""Bible Humper!""...ohh how he is so smart (more sarcasm), ohh yeah he also got in his jabs about every mistake i make in life, which is always fun to hear (EXTREME SARCASM) yeah but i can deal with him, he has the witt of a goldfish (no sarcasm, just extreme laughter). Sorry i just insalted the goldfish.  anyways time heals all and so my faith will remain strong...

"event","Julie and i went swimming today wich was rather uneventful. Peter and KT were there but they left around three ish. we hazed peter a little but didnt want to scare kt so we decided that we would wait until band and then get him really good, im thinking a trash can would work...or maybe a cubby...anyways we were molested like 10 times by many little kids, so that was a little weird. we also saw some girls who were all giggly over some boys...i sure hope we were never like that...but anyways there was one really hott kid there but me and julie wont release his name..muhahah. we also thought it would be a good idea to tan a little, so well we sort of got tan..more of a burn/tan depending on the lighting...but i sure am proud of it haha. overall it was lame. i am starting to realize things that were cool like two years ago are pretty dumb now that we are lazy and dont want to do anything. thats sad. Ohh yeah and i also saw Sable there which was AWESOME! i love her. Ohh yeah and there is a new ""who is attending dave list"" here it is: me, julie, cait, matt, amanda, carp, nikki, val, jones, christina, and alicia.

"event","Matt and Nikki's party was awesome! We went camping and all the girls fit in one tent...almost haha. Putting the tents up was another story...they say it is easy to put up but they lie! Anyways it was really fun and I love those kids bunches and I am going to miss them like crazy, but im sure they will come back and see us...i sure hope so. 

well all that was the happy side of my brain, well who's to say im not happy right now, actually i dont know what i am. It's summer, i should be a little more stoked about it than i am i think. the trio has spent an entire year away from the (will be freshmen) 8th graders. which has i think had some effect on us in a weird way that i might be making up in my head, who knows. but this withdrawl from them might make next year a hard year for everyone to adapt to eachother because we all have changed and it is rather apparent to me that we have matured a lot, we have changed for the better i believe. speaking for the trio we are over the punk phase and we are moving on to bigger and better things...DAVE!, but not only dont we act immature as often as we used to, we know how to act when needed to. like when we went back to the middle school things sure have changed, people were throwing things and screaming, and normally we would think that is funny and join in but for some reason it was annoying and we just wanted to kill them all...thats how we have matured i guess. 

As for speaking for myself I have made some major mistakes, i dont know what i was thinking through some of the things i did but i wish that i could start over and start fresh and innocent. Dont think that i did something that was bad...it was more emotionally, nothing phsyical. But this thing was something that taught me what i didnt want in a person but it has also i think told people that i am one kind of person that im not but i can see where they are getting this. You know how there are people that can do something wrong and than bounce back from it and no one really notices what they did wrong in the first place...well if you dont know someone like that i sure do, but anyways i wish i had that ability to hide things and make them seem that they were better than what they really were. I sort of know now what i want but there is always that fog that blocks you from seeing what really is there for you. I just really wish that i could sit down with all my friends and the people i care about and tell them who i am really am i what i believe and that i am not what they have always thought i was. it really sucks that i cant do that but i am willing to work at convincing them that i am a better person than they think. I know i havent done everything in my power so far to do so because their are people who i shouldnt have brought into my life because they havent helped me in my search for this...im not blaiming them on all my problems because i am the biggest part im sure but they also have helped make me look different in other people's eyes. I think the one thing that hurts the most is when you tell people ""ohh yeah i am a Christian"" and they respond with ""wow you dont look the type."" WHAT WOULD POSESS SOMEONE TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT!!! AHH! yeah well i guess to many people are heartless. wait that was harsh. but thats just one of the many personal examples i could throw at ya. I know i should just sit back and wait for my day to shine and let God take it all over but its eating away at me...i dont know what to do. I am just sick and tired of having to prove myself to the people who mean the most to me, no one should have to do that.

"event","today was soooo much fun. well it started out as getting up at 7:30 to go and clean out the cubbies and paint them and clean the band room up as much as possible which was a good idea...well so we all thought. We finished up all the painting and then we had to clean up and the spilled paint and thinking logically we are like ""it will come up with a little paint thinner and some rags,"" well easier said than done that is for sure. So we realize that none of the paint is comming off with just using the rags so we such for some brillo pads and we find a few and then we eventually sent peter and kyle h. back for more (they will now be referred to as ""our slaves"" haha thats what they are now). Anyways so after we got a head start on getting all this paint off the floor and getting high off fumes like crazy from the paint thinner, the paint itself, and some cheap Orange Clean that Mason was sooo proud to have. Yeah so we are scubbing and when i say we i mean me, julie and cait...not kyle and peter...they  were playing a form of hockey on the paint thinner soaked floor which was most deff. dangerous but nothing stopped them thats for sure. So me julie and cait are working our butts off and our slaves are playing hockey and then mason comes in and is like well guys i have some good and bad news for ya....and he proceeds to tell us that the principle and director of matenence is comming over to check out what needs done to the band room....remember this is the situation-me, julie, and cait covered in paint scrubbing the floor where the paint can be seen more than the tiles, our slaves playing hockey in paint thinner, peter always screaming that gasoline would work better but we might die, the floor is soaking wet with chemicals of all kinds, and we are all really high from fumes-so we are cleaning up as fast as we can so no one falls and dies on the floor and then we decide to walk to peters while mason talks to the ""important men.""

So we are walking to peters and us girls wanted to see his duck...Edward, he is amazing. So we force peter to run after it and catch it so we can look and gaze at it and then the dog almost killed it...it did get away and overall it is a really nice duck...i want one now...anyways so we walk back to the band room and met up with mason.

So we are all done painting and cleaning up and peter and kyle fight with mason over some mt. dew and they win and they have a mini party with themselves while we watch. So while my mom is talking ""band business"" with mason we all go out in the hall and sit and talk and then peter starts to laugh with pop in his mouth and it comes out his nose...ew. that was wrong. I remember one other time at austins peter...cough cough.


well thats all for today



well i could talk about some problems in my life but i dont want to bore you...muhahahahahaha


Oohhh yeah i went to see Harry Potter today with Kurtis and Jules...it was alright...so many hott men though...well not so much in that movie but the previews....growl...oh la la...AMBER GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF!!!....*sigh* men..."

I think it will be just like middle school because now we have the same ppl in band just we are a little older and hopefully more mature or mason will end up having a heart attack. I didnt really realize how immature we were until you see it from a bystanders point of view and then you realize...ohh man i am a moron for thinking all that was funny. I wont mention any names but mostly the girls were the immature ones which that could be due to the fact that guys are predicted to be that way..sorry i dont mean to tick anyone off but im stating a fact. Wow it is really weird to look back on things that we did and realize they werent all that funny, but they were because you were taking part in them, other than that they were about as funny as a circus clown..i hate clowns...anyways yeah its weird to think that lauren and hannah are jr.s and they will be graduating in no time...ohh man i am having a mommy moment so deal with for a moment...alright i thinks its over, ohh wait no, for once in my life i am not the one who has a boyfriend and gets burned for answers which in a way is a nice feeling..what am i saying it is AWESOME!!! ohh i am going to hell for that one...yep hell it is.

Kurtis's was awesome. yeah ben made some new friends and me and julie beat on kurtis the whole time it was great, ohh and his mom is awesome, i think i am moving in maybe soon. good times. graduation was sad but im sure they all were happy they were leaving, well we know matt was happy, but i will miss them all as i have been saying for the last past month. we created some good inside jokes this year and it is pretty sad that there wont be to many more of those but i think we will live...maybe. today is one of our many family cook out things and i might kill someone or something who knows yet. family is alright when they arent anywhere near you thats my rule. sorry about all the a.d.d.-ness. i think that is something that my family has also brought on...i will do anything to get away...gerr.

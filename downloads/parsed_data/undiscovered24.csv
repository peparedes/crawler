"event","haha, so I'll update you guys on my life since march 26th...<br>
<br>
I went to Prom. Jeff was quite the amazing date... haha. After that my
life basically consisted of Jeff and Tyler every day. LOSed it up a few
times. Need to do that again so if my lovely LOS people see this pick a
date. <br>
<br>
Summer thank god... I've seen Jeff and Tyler every day all but three
days each... Then I went to six flags with Aly it was such a good time.
<br>
<br>
Then the LOVELY jamie spinello is now at my house for&nbsp; 10 days,
she came on tuesday of last week.. shes awesomee and shes making me
update this.. idk why though. tuesday we went out to eat at my marys...
then came home hung out with tyler jeff and lauren at some playground.
wednesday we went out to eat and then went to gregs and then i had a
bunch of people go over my house to suprise her. didn't turn out as
well as i planned but it was very fun. Then Thursday night me jeff
tyler and lauren went to old mystic village, then lickety splits and
back to my house to watch team america... then the next day we went to
newport all day it was just me lauren and jamie. Then later that day
Tyler came to my house and we went to jamestown to see fireworks but
then never ended up doign that cause they were postponed so we went
back to newport and walked around and ate at panara bread....
then&nbsp; saturday I suprised Jamie by having her sister Lauren come
and we went to the zoo, beach, out to eat and mini golfing. much fun.
and then Jeffrey came over that night and we all talked and had a
really good time we went to stop and shop and got food and pigged out..
then yesterday... bad day.... Jeff and Tyler came over but decided that
it'd be really cool to be mad at me for no reason and then when I tried
to talk to them and figure out what I did they didn't feel like telling
me but whatever so lauren kicked them out ... then we went out to eat..
and came home and went to Will's party. Which was so much fun. It
started out boring but then once we all started hanging out it was fun.
Talked with Katy a lot. met some new people. idk it was a really good
time. they're a fun group of people<br>
<br>
now its fourth of July !! We're gonna get ready and go out for most of
the day I think, then going to the fireworks laterr! Hoping to see a
lotttttt of people! <br>
<br>
<br>
Happy 4th! <br>"

"event","Today was boring. IPS was okay. Aly and my spaghetti tower barely even holds the box. Oh well. we suck. 

World civ =  horrible. I hate those fishbowl things.

Spanish is so dumb! Mrs. Risley gets so mad at me for talking and then i stop and just mind my own business and shes like LIVEN UP JANE! shes gay. ihaterher.

After school Me Lauren Matt and Greg went to Applebees and ate a bunch of food. It was fun. Matt and greg fight so much. GOD GREG GET YOUR FEET OFF MY SIDE haha... oh well. I love when its just us and the boys, too bad Josh isn't apart of the ""crew"" anymore. he was always so much fun.

Saturday I went out to eat with Kelly and my parents at some wiiicked fance place, they had a harp player. I loved it. I was kinda not feeling great though but it was still fun.

Sunday me and Lauren picked up my cousin and went to the championship game. dissapointing loss but thats okay. Then we went out to eat at the pizza place. I love Jordan and Lauren. It's always a good time when we're together. During dinner Kelly called, shes been so depressed over the loss of dan so she needed to get out of the house. so when we left I went food shopping with her and then we went to blockbuster got shall we dance, it wasnt too bad. Then I watched that all night and fell asleep. i'm really tired today though. Oh wellll.

"event","With Lauren and Dan both having their license, its great. But I mean. Dan's obviously apart of the family. Just to think that with him driving around something bad could happen to him or lauren. Thats really scary. I care about them both way too much, and love them both. It's so scary to know that when Dan leaves my house he's not leaving in the company of my dad or when lauren leaves his house my dads not there in the drivers seat to pick her up. I guess it's stupid but I just get nervous sometimes watching them drive. Especially when I see Dan struggling to get out of my driveway. The poor kid tries to use the turn around since my driveway is HORRIBLE to get out of everyone knows it, but the snow is so bad that he just gets stuck there and has to attempt to get himself out. and It probably doesn't help feeling like you're being watched and not knowing what to do. Then I have to watch him finally get himself out, then back out instead of being turned around and then get stuck at the top because he didnt press the gas as hard as he could to get out of the driveway cause you have to do that too. Then he FINALLY gets out after he realized he needed to press on the gas. It all basically made me wanna cry. My mom made him promise he'd call when he got in. I really hope he does. Just to know he's okay. I mean, it's really nerveracking with lauren cause shes my older sister and all but I know how she drives cause I had to spend six months with her driving everyone around everywhere and I've been out in the car with her. So maybe thats why I sound like I'm more worried about Dan when he's driving. It's just scary. I've always been like that though. When it's snowing or raining really hard and its thundering and lightening and my parents arent home I'll sit on the couch in front of the window and every 30 seconds I'll turn around to see if the car comes down the driveway. And everytime I see an ambulance on the road I think of everyone thats not with me, like if I was on my way to the mall with Kelly and I saw one and Lauren or one or both of my parents were out I'd immediately think of them, and it always makes me wanna call them. It doesnt help that everytime you turn the news on theres always bad news about car accidents or on the radio with all the traffic interuptions. I feel really lame thinking like that but it's the way I am.

Anyways the phone just rang and it was Dan. So he's home.

The week back to school was lame. I hate school. I want summer. I've been so tired lately I don't even want to do anything. Even if it's hanging out with friends. I don't know whats wrong with me. 

Twenty-four days until my birthday! 

I'm gonna go now that I feel alot better."

Kinda mad that the guy didn't come and bring wood this week after he said he would. Now the kitchen isn't gonna be finished by my birthday. Which is in like 32 days. I don't even want anything this year. I know that my sisters getting me Aladdin, The Lion King, How to lose a guy in ten days, and I'm gonna ask someone to get the little rascals. But that's all I really want. Or that I can think of. 


I want to get a job, but I'm so lazy that I don't know where to get one. Hopefully i can do something easy like a hostess or maybe someone who just answers a phone. who knowwsss. 


I'm gonna go though <3

Afterwards Aly came back to my house and we talked on the phone and watched tv until like 12. Then in the morning we watched some of Garfield, it's actually really funny. Then we made cake, and watched the rest of the movie. We watched a lot of tv, and then aly begged me to let her put makeup on me, basically she made me look like a hooker, and I definitely got revenge, we took pictures , once the computer in my room gets fixed i'll put them online. After that we listened to music and such. 

Then after Aly left I took a shower cause I was sticky from trying to scrub off all the makeup. Then I napped. Then I ate dinner. haha, then I watched tv.

basically it was a boring rest of my night.

Tomorrow I'm going shopping. =D souped for that. I need more shirts. I love getting new shirts.

Me and Katie got scarred for life by some 20 year old man, lol. and My favorite Truth or Dare competition took place in the food court with some chill guys. Then We got pizza at like 2:30 and watched some girls kick the shit out of eachother. had to have been the greatest thing ever. Then we talked to Jose and Jeff until four, and met his cousin alex who looked identical to Vin Diesel...It was a lot of fun, I loved it. '05 white chicks haha <3 Aly, Katie, Syd, Ariel and Britt. 

Valentines day wasn't anything special for me. No big deal. 

A certain kid has me and a few others a little bothered. I hate to be mean so I'm not saying anything, It'll pass. 

Today was boring as usual. 

I'm going shopping with My family in providence on Saturday, but if anyone wants to hang out Friday night or Saturday night let me know. 

Might be going to see The wedding date with Lo and Aly, idk though. 

I <3 Gregory David because he helps me with absolutely everything. 

I'm almost positive one of my friends has a pretty big crush ony my sister. I think its great. 

Happy Late Valentines Day Everyone

"event","Last night I went to the games, It was fun, but I was in a pretty bad mood so it wasn't as fun as it could of been. Afterwards I just went home. I was real upset from everything and then the car ride home just killed me. I got home and wouldn't talk to anyone, I went upstairs for awhile and thought I was okay so I just went and watched tv, and I just started balling my eyes out. My mom came in trying to get what happened out of me but I couldn't talk to her about it cause I know she would just get really mad, if not at me then at Kelly, and the other thing that was wrong wasn't really anything important. She kept asking me questions like, did someone hurt you or was someone mean to you, did you have a bad time tonight whats wrong. I wanted to be like why don't you ask your daughter she should know, but I just kept shaking my head no. Then she told me If i needed to talk to promise that she'd talk to her and thent old me she was a good listener. Then she left and I watched a movie. Was way too tired to finish it and I went upstairs to sleep. Lauren got back from Dans and came in my room and woke me up and she was like.. Are you okay, and I told her to go away and that i was too tired, and she was like I just wanna make sure you're okay and that nothing bad happened and you're not in trouble. so I promised her I wasn't in trouble and she kissed me on the cheek and left. I love that they care but, sometimes I know that  if i say something about it it won't make me feel better, just talking about things doesn't always work , especially in this case. I feel okay this morning Mainly because Kelly isn't home. The whole time I was downstairs she kept saying stuff about it and my parents just kept getting mad so that was another reason I wasn't gonna open up to them. And she kept trying to figure out what was wrong. I just wanted to turn around and tell her it was all her fault but I would of regretted it. I know by talking to Lauren she would just tell me the same thing kelly did, in a less harsh, and not screaming kind of way. Lauren's always so much nicer and understanding, but I know it's the truth, it's just .. hard.

Well, anyways, I'm done complaining... 

Whoever is commenting anonymously, you're part of the reason I was upset last night, just stop cause it's not even funny anymore. you're not cute, i tried to be nice about everything but you're just really immature and you comeplain about me and my friends being stuck up and snobby and saying we're always mean to people but then you turn around and are completely the same way towards us for no reason. So please just stop.

"event","Lets see... Today started off okay

Health sucked horribly. The test was basically stuff he never taught us, but whatever. Then after health I didn't have an exam so me and Sam left and went out to breakfast. 

Afterwards, dropped off Sammy. Went home, took a shower, played some gta. Layed around. Then went out to lunch with Lauren Kelly and Vince. 

Which leads me to something...
I don't understand how someone could be so mean to someone who does nothing but nice things to them? They complain about how ""scrubby"" they look when they're not around you and how they don't want people to think you're dating some 'scrub'. Why do people care so much about what other people are saying? Honestly you should have better things to worry about that being the most perfect person in everyone elses eyes. Why does what other people think matter it'll just make you unhappy when really you should concentrate on making yourself and the people you really care about happy. 

I'm beginning to hate livejournals for their immaturatiy. 

Comment if you want.

HAPPY SWEET SIXTEEN NATALIE!! I <3 YOU"

"event","I didn't go to winterball. I don't really think I regret it. yet anyways. theres 3 more years of it anyways. Instead I went out with Jordan Aly and Lauren. We spent like a million dollars on candy. Went out to eat. Went to Dunkin' Donuts, went to blockbuster. We got cellular, it was really good. Then we went out to breakfast this morning, and then went to the mall and tried on all these dresses. It was fun. 

Now it's snowing. 

I'm not in the mood to be updating though so I'll write later."

I Love Buckwheat, Porky and Alfalfa.

Honestly, without Buckwheat the elementary days would be imcomplete and sad, and I wouldn't know what people mean by a supermarket tabloid, and I would miss my chats about people, and our crazy lunchroom sarcasm.
And Porky we all know is my best friend, and without her I'd die because shes like my other half. and I would never be able to talk about how I really feel, or be able to just laugh about the most random things.
And without Alfalfa, the whole gang is incomplete, of course we were never friends until this year, and of course I hated her before, but where would I be without someone to make fun of mr. fee, or any of the teachers at that, or to have the sarcasm you need to get through a hard class, or just someone to tell you a completely random story that even though it had nothing to do with you or what was being done at the time , brightens your day completely.

I <3 you guys. 

and I love all my friends"

Last night was fun, Went to my aunts house at like 6:30, played scene it tv edition, we were losing when I left, we ate food too. Then I got picked up at 8:00 and went to Kyle's with Aly, Katie, Jamie, Rachel, Ashley, Shadeck, Kyle, Zack, Frank, Gabe Alex, Matt, and Sean? I think that's it. We hung out, the boys played a lot of basketball. We went outside sledding in the dark on a hill that had barely no snow on it. That was fun, jumped on a trampoline that a lot of snow of it, got soaking wet, got hit in the face with a snowball, got snow down my shirt from shadeck, put snow down his shirt. Talked with Zack for a lot of the night about old Elementary times, and our secret crushes on eachother haha. Went inside and watched the Ball drop...

First minutes of '05 i spent laying ontop  of zack and aly .. Love it haha..

Aly came home with me, we ate food and watched Napoleon Dynamite and fell asleep on the couches. Woke up around 10, talked... Watched made, went online aly left.

Now I'm here debating a shower lol.

Anyways.. today sucks.. IPS went by pretty fast.. Got a WONDERFUL present from Aimee haha... World Civ I had to present some gay project.shitty. Then Lunch was fun as always with Aly Grace and Nelltar. Web Design I didn't do much. Hung out with Nicole Aly Grace and Anthony and looked at peoples livejournals the entire time.... Spanish was stupid as always... took a quiz did some gay worksheet and then sat around for the rest of the class. 

Got a lovely poem from Lauren today...

Jane is such a big big slut
why does she have to be my sister? YUCK!
She has the biggest eyeballs in the world.
Too big to be on such a little girl.
She likes to discuss all of her waste 
and when she was little she used to eat paste.

(picture of a girl)

Like Sean's Picture? Isn't it pretty?
Do yuo care or are you busy rubbing up fitty?
You both know you'll get married someday,
and then you can jump in the hot tub and play.
Just kidding Jane, I cannot make fun
Cause we both know that you're number one!
Merry Xmas and a happy new year!
and I hope that your life is filled with cheer!

She loves me we know it.

I'm gonna go watch Oprah"

"event","This weekend I went to Aly's and then we picked up mark and me mel mark and aly went to both the basketball games. I hung out with Zack and Kyle the entire time.. Greg was being gay towards the end of the night and was purposely trying to make me mad but whatever I don't care. I'm officially apart of the club that Katie and Chrissy are in lol... It's nice. 

I spent the entire day doing that gay world civ project so I can go shopping tomorrow for all the christmas stuff. I got the present for secret santa, and I got sam's present. I need to find something for Amy. I know what me and Aly are doing for Shadeck. It's friggen awesome. We still need to figure some more stuff out though. I need to get something for Vince because he always does he nicest stuff for me and Lauren and he deserves to have something good for christmas. Oh and I'm gonna get Jordan something too. I might get something for Aly. Or I'll make her something. not sure yet. I'll probably end up getting my mom and dad something. But if not i'll get them something after christmas when i can actually spend money on something good instead of trying to find something cheap cause by the time i'm done shopping for friends I never have much left. 

I'm excited for christmas even though it kinda snuck up on us this year. I hope it snows before christmas.. so it'll feel like christmastime cause it doesn't right now.. not sure why.. It's going by too fast I think."

<P><STRONG>I woke up around 7 I was wicked sick and spent the entire day throwing up.. it sucked. Everyone went out looking for a car for Lauren .. they left at like one thirty and came back at 6. The entire time I'm all alone cause Kelly never came home... It wasn't fun but I told them to leave, I slept a lot though.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Friday school was school nothing happened that was exciting... web design wasn't as bad today.. me aly and shadeck had a nice talk about a few people who suck at life. but thats okay. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The football game got postponed until today.. I'm not sure if I'm going... I don't know yet.. After school I went home really quick and paul was here working on our garage that lauren destroyed.. then I grabbed some food and went to Matt's to hang out with him and greg.. We ate a lot of food...and played grand theft auto and watched tv and talked.. then natalie came over and made more food then eventually me aly and greg came back to my place and we hung out watching movies and talking.. then my mom came home and we watched some of full house and greg eventually left...So me and Aly were gonna go to the mall but .. my family spent like 4 years long talking about a car for Lauren and arguing over it.. so me and aly went to blockbuster and got Fahreinheit 911 and Dawn of the Dead... Then we went and got food, aly got pizza but I had soup...then we went BACK to blockbuster cause when aly was complaining about wide screen she took the movie away from me and put it back only she put the wrong movie back&nbsp;and we got two of the same move...way to go aly lol ... Me and Al fell asleep at 8:30 like a half hour into the movie ..</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Then saturday we woke up.. on the couch downstairs.. and then we got up and got some pizza and made hot chocolate.. what a mix.. lol.. then we watched dawn of the dead.. and i must say watching ""scary"" movies with aly makes the day start off excellent... haha it was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life especially that little girl at the beginning who reminded me sooo much of aly hahah.. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Then we went upstairs and hung out for awhile.. and watched tv.. and then eventually aly went home at like 1:30? and i slept for the rest of the day.. Then Tim came over and we watched random movies that were on tv and he left around 1030..</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Of course my entire family is wicked sick now because of me.. Including Aly... which i'm sorry about.. haha &lt;3</STRONG></P>

nothing more, nothing less.
My eyes are swollen and sticky.
I guess they are comfortable that way.
There is no definition in the skin around my eyes.
Just warm water covered by thin, pink skin.
I'm always waiting for something, then it comes, then it leaves, and then I am waiting for it again.
I think that is why people live. They look forward.  Look forward to something.  Something positive. Then sometimes something positive happens. Then it disappears and you feel indifferent, you are waiting for something new to look forward to.  For me, it's an endless cycle.  I think about you. I am with you and continue to think about you. I am alone and thinking about being with you. Then I am with you again. And that is all. That is what I do.  I love you.

Good, bad. Happiness, sadness. There is enough of each and its opposite to leave me feeling apathetic.

I am too dependant on too many things.  I've probably been a very dependant person for a long time.  I don't think this is good, because I will be screwed if certain things are ever aken away from me.

Prom was fun.

My weekend was decent, babysitting in New Hamshire was a lot better once Brendan came up.  We went swimming and my nephew Harrison (hes only 1) is possibly the most beautiful little creation on the face of this earth. (him and someone else, of course)  If you are ever upset, call me and I will come to the rescue with Harrison and he will hug and kiss you because he's wonderful and affectionate and could make anyone smile. I love him.

I also love how people are stupid and leave comments in my livejournal that don't pertain to anything that I've posted. It's funny. If you are a nice person, you won't leave rude anonymous comments in my livejournal.  

I have met some really nice people in the past few months. It's so nice to know there are still some nice ppl in this town who I have yet to meet. I'm so sick of the miserable ppl who don't relaize that the only reason they are miserable is because they are bitchy and rude to everyone and this is why no one likes them. Maybe you wouldn'y be so miserable if you didn't walk around with your head in the air like you're better then everyone else and making comments and the most disgusting faces because that is why you come to school, you come to school to make other ppls days miserable, you dont come to make friends and learn, you come for everything that you should be staying home to acheive.  So if you plan on being a miserable bitch, dont look a me, because I'm going to smile at you. I'm going to give you the biggest smile I have and hope your life changes so you don't have to be miserable.  I don't want all you suck asses to be miserable, you all deserve to smile and have friends that are nice. I dont know why you deserve this but you do. Everyone does. haha

Like it's this inside joke that no one else knows about. A sad joke that makes them seem completely pathetic to me.  Some peopl catch on to the joke and other people go on believing that these people are amazing (ha or something)and this is exactly what keeps the ""scene"" cycle going.

Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch
Watching the clouds roll by
They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago,
When she used color carelessly, painted his portrait
A thousand times - or maybe just his smile - 
And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go

'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves
A lovely world

Oil streaked daisies covered the living room wall
He put water colored roses in her hair
He said, ""Love, I love you, I want to give you the mountains, the sunshine,
the sunset too
I want to give you everything as beautiful as you are to me

'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves
A lovely world

So they sat down and made a drawing of their love, an art to live by
They painted every passion, every home, created every beautiful child,
in the winter they were weavers of warmth,
in the summer they were carpenters of love
They thought blue prints were too sad so they made them yellow

'Cause they were painters, and they were painting themselves
A lovely world

Until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil
And in her heart she knew something was wrong
She went running
through the orchard screaming,
'No God, don't take him from me!'
But by the time she got there, she feared he already had gone
She got to where he lay, water colored roses in his hands for her
She threw them down screaming, 'Damn you man, don't leave me
with nothing left behind but these cold paintings, these cold portraits 
to remind me'

He said, 'Love I leave, but only a little, try to understand
I put my soul in this life we created with these four hands
Love, I leave, but only a little, this world holds me still
My body may die now, but these paintings are real'
So many seasons came and so many seasons went
and many times she saw her love's face watering the flowers,
talking to the trees and singing to his children,
And when the wind blew, she knew he was listening,
and how he seemed to laugh along, an how he seemed to hold her
when she was crying

'Cause they were painters, and they were painting themselves
A lovely world

Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch

Yes, she and her canvas still follow 

Because they are painters and they are painting themselves

My parents are home from Aruba. I missed them and their hugs and how they drive me crazy, I dont know how I'll ever be able to go away to college, I can't be away from them for more then a week.  

I don't understand how people change their mentality so quickly.
I'm actually talking about a specific person.  But it's not good to ditch your friends as soon as you meet a member of the opposite sex (or of the same sex, for that matter.)  If you're out there and you do this, then you should probably stop because it makes yuor friends feel like shit.

I saw Being John Malkavitch (i dont know how to spell that one) last night and it was fucked. I would definately reccomend seeing it, if you like crazy movies.

I have been extremely unsuccessful with making a new friend. I really have been trying, in an effortless sort of way.  It sucks when you are a hermit who can find your way outof the shell you've been living in for years.  I need lessons on how to friggin talk to people because I'm shy or weird. im not sure which one.

"event","I've stumbled upon what I would call a huge problem. I wont use this journal to complain about how miserable live is .. because I dont think people usually want to hear about it .. everyone has their own problems. Dont take this personally if you use your lj to vent all your problems.. I just dont plan on doing that myself. I feel like i want to be really young again and have sleepovers where i stay up all night giggling about stupid things and eat ridiculous amounts of food.. and I want to do this with friends. I want to drive around and scream because thats fun and i want to have fun before its too late or something. I want a friend or friends who can do this with me, we dont need to sit in and cry our hearts out.. (although that's necessary sometimes) Are there people out there who want to do the same things as me? I wish i could go back to being 13 years old, when i could talk to anyone and make new friends.. but everyone jst wants to find reasons not to like people and that makes it really hard to meet nice people. Cant everyone put their petty differences aside and just be nice to each other and have sleepovers and just have some fucking fun???? HHaha ok so ill relax but if ppl like this still exsist, then theres still some hope.. and thats great so please if youre out there.. let me know. anyone who hates me for no reason.. I have a suggestion for you.-you could always realize that lifes too short for this shit, and lets just have some funnn. please!!! I'm not going to reread this becase im afraid ill delete it if i do so .. here you go.. i dont know?"

"event","so i dont know what im doing with this livejournal business because i live in the dark ages or something. but im doing my best. im thinkin about 2 ppl might read this.. so this is more like a thing to keep me busy from doing things like cutting my hair for no reason other then keeping me from going insane... boredom drives me insane or into a senseless rage where i either flip out at ppl for no reason or ... cut my hair. im trying to find myself a nice nude pic to use as my icon thing.. but all the ones ive found arent working for some reason. is it wicked immature to think i might make a few new friends by making a friggin livejournal? oh wait that was a question that wont be answered because i have no friends to answer it for me. haha i dont feel sorry for myself im just being honest.. anyway im done."

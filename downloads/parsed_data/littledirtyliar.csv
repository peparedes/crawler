"event","i have a headache. i hate nights where brennan has a rough bedtime. i called chris so that he could talk to him before i yelled some more (i hate, HATE yelling and it makes me very sad to do it, i wanna cry afterwards.)and chris was like he's prolly upset cause he doesn't want us to live apart anymore. well bullshit. cause then he followed by saying brennan didn't sleep well last night. it was totally a case of brennan was overtired and not cooperating because of it. also i was getting angry, which i know doesn't help but i am only human myself. chris and i seem to fight almost as much apart as together. the last few days have been good but still. he gets angry over little things or doesn't listen to me (like always) and then says i am one-sided, when in reality it is often him. he tends to be only out for himself. he needs to change that. i sacrifice things all the time. often times my sanity. or my well being or whatever else i can give give give. i dunno. bad bedtime puts me in a bad mood and then makes me feel like a rotten mommy for not being able to handle it. it makes me not want brennan and then i get really angry because i love him very much. he is my world. it's just sometimes and more so lately i don't know what to do. i just don't want to feel so robotic and worthless, stagnant or like a bad mommy. sometimes everything boils into one thing. ack. i have a headache. i don't even know if i make sense."

So when you slam
Down the hammer
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when youre standing
On my fingers
Can you see it in your heart ? 
And when you try
To break my spirit
It wont work
Because theres nothing left to break
Anymore
All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded
I never said, I never said that they were
Completely unfounded

Until the earth that wants me
Finally has me
Oh youve done it now
You wont rest
Until the hearse that becomes me
Finally takes me
Oh youve done it now
And you wont smile
Until my loving mouth
Is shut good and proper
Forever

All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded
I never said, I never said that they were

Written lies, twisted lies

They werent lies
They werent lies

I never said
I never said

I could have dragged you in

By association

Ive always been true to you
In my own sick way

that isn't there
i want to live
i roll over and you're not there
i'm only standing on the shore

i had some friends but i want more...

i see the future and it's all mine
want to be perfect, i'm taking my time
i'll try not to act like i'm so far away
i try to be right in whatever i say
deeper feelings recur again & again & again & again
a complex spiral leads me to spin...

to see the earth turn one more time
i wanna live

"event","it rained and rained all day yesterday. we got well over 7 and 1/2 inches. we are expected to get more today. people near winona drowned in their cars. we had at least 9 cars stall out on our street. one car died completely and with one car, the people couldn't get out of for awhile. i called for help but before the police could get here or ever show up for that matter, someone with a pickup truck helped them to safety. the water was up on my car doors. the waves lapped our front steps like the wave pool at noah's ark. my neighbors front lawn was a lake. we don't even live by the river. no one can get to my job because they all live in minnesota. it is a mess around here."

"event","i am actually enjoying todays cold and rainy weather. i love when it is about this temp outside. 65-75 is fine with me. i cant wait for fall and i know it will go by fast. way to fast and then stupid winter. i had a really great day yesterday with dan and brennan. we went fishing in lansing and didnt catch anything. mostly we got sucked under the rocks. it was not as good as the fishing the three of us did last weekend at my parents house. there we caught a ton of fish and had a great dinner of beer batter fried fish. mmmm. anyway. after fishing we went to a park in waukon where brennan knocked me off a teeter totter (never had to spell that before) type thing...hard to describe and really smashed up my right arm/elbow. ive got a few decent purple bruises and it hurts. plus it hit my right shoulder which is part of the neck and shoulder issues that i have been having go on. it was a park i played in has a kid and something that was there since i was little. also the rocket was still there. it was fun. later in the afternoon while walking at twin springs in decorah my shoulder popped out of place very loudly. it hurt so bad i got dizzy for a second. its still pretty sore and strange feeling today. i guess im not really sure if it went in or out of place. my shoulder is so messed up anyways. oh well. the walk was beautiful. it felt like fall outside and we saw tons and tons of cool mushrooms of all kinds. some were bright red and some were bright yellow and orange. it was just a perfect day. i need more of those."

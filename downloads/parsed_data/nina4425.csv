"event","goodmorning eeeveryone. Its most deffinatly  10:09 and im not exactly sure why im up. but im going 2 go back 2 bed very soon here. I woke up to my sister asking...whos car is that in the driveway? I look out and theres a silver car with seat covers thay say ""wild"" on them. hm. interesting. very.  we'll sooon find out bcuz with 3 little sister, they ask the same question every 5 seconds so someone will eventually tell. 

so in my last entry i said somethings that were mean about dusty. I totally take them back becuase were cool now. and i love him.

last night. went 2 the canfield fair with Kayla. Got a meatball sandwich and cheese fries. UGH. wonderful. Then we met up with Gates,Dusty, and Dewey. then went home. the ride home was a little akward. Me and Gates were in a..i wouldnt call it a fight..but...we im not sure. We didnt talk. Or sit by eachother. Which made me feel like shit but..he said sorry like 10x and he's super hott so i forgave him of course. Kayla almost murdered Dewey. Which was the funniest thing ever. Then dewey asked her on a date to top it off. hahahaha funnyyy...and Dusty. hm. We told him 2 watch the road cuz he was doin some major swerive. lol anyways, yep thats how my night went.

oh yea the bonfire got cancelled cuz my little tessy got sick =( aww feel better babe! lol


weeeell..back 2 bed. laaaater kids.

"event","<P><FONT size=2>yea..I had one of these a while ago, but i stopped writing in it. Im not sure why but i decided to start one up again. alright, now dont get me wrong. I really really like Gates. I do. Alot. but, theres another person in the picture who keeps interfering. that person would be DUSTY. i know what you were thinking, that I prob. liked another guy or something? but i dont. i only like gates. the thing is dusty acts like he likes gates the same way i like him. ew.&nbsp;seriously..he has to be with gates 24-7. and it bothers me.&nbsp; I really dont mind Dusty. I dont care if he hangs out with us. I really dont. But sometimes I need a break. And i need to be alone with Gates. Idk, maybe its just me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Let me note: friday I had a really really fun time with Tess,Christie,Michelle and Abby. Were deffinatly good fans. and the hottest girls that got on tv. lol o yea..good game to the boys friday night. you all did very good.=) check out the pics!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>hmm tonight, Tess is having a bonfire. Which is FUN. because its acually something to do. I wanted gates to go with me, but...""he's probably doing something else"" or atleast thats what he said. So i hung up on him. is that mean?? hm i didnt think so. so when he texted me and said ""thanks for hanging up on me."" i replyed- ""thanks for hanging out with me"" yep..oh he's calling..this should be interesting. </FONT></P>

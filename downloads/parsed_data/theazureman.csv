[& echoed in the well]
</b>
There's a term audio producers use when recording. It's called the signal-to-noise ratio, and it's basically referring to the fact that the greater the number of sounds are being recorded, the less any of them has any impact, the more of a jumble it all becomes. That's why when you see microphones outside, they're covered with foam clown noses or the scrotums of particularly shaggy muppets. Cut out the extraneous noises of street and breeze.

I mention this because sometimes when I visit you, Internet, I get the sensation that you are a giant stadium, filled to capacity, and every single attendee was told that they would be giving the keynote address. At one o'clock. And now it's 1:03. & I will endeavor to keep this brief, so as not to add overmuch to the commotion.

When I was younger I imagined (a flight of fancy that might have become a story, or might still) the construction of a library, assiduously and deliberately assembled, of all the books that were never read. How big would it need to be? The size of the NY Metropolitan Library? The Louvre? The Pentagon? Belgium? How many plaintive, unattended words committed with urgency and sincerity and lost without a trace, except in this strange library. I still wonder about it.

How much more so are you, Internet? Within your vast & ever-expanding confines, what enormities of text are floating in neglected servers or languishing in the dreaded oubliettes of tl;dr? All of the forgotten blogs, unseen tweets, articles posted into the yawning thunder of your capacity digital stadium. If the Internet were physical, the Earth would not have enough dust to bury these undistinguished volumes of prose.

& thus, LiveJournal, the Sargasso Sea of social media. Only MySpace and Geocities are more hollowed out (unless you are a young Russian, in which case this joint is quite vibrant), their constituents drawn to the brightness & brevity of more colorful sites, where, to quote Arthur Jensen, ""All necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredoms amused."" I miss the thoughtful, sometimes heartfelt, sometimes poignant, sometimes whimsical voices I would encounter here, and the time when such expressions seemed appropriate, instead of memes and soundbites. But I always was a whore for the written word.

Most of the friends I had, are no longer here. Some of those that remain here, are no longer friends. But a couple of sweethearts & I have conspired here to make our way here, the way we once did. We will be living fossils, like coelacanths, cruising in the inky, abyssal Madagascarene trenches of the internet, unknown save for perhaps an unsuspecting and very surprised fisherman. 

And given the reception my writing has gotten over the years, it's only fitting that I should be here, in this graveyard of voices that never made a sound."

[wherein your humble narrator reveals his crankdom]</b>

I was in my car listening to the radio when the news of Osama bin-Laden's killing came on. I was on my way to a downtown bar, and while I was there I heard both of the dominant political positions expressed, each driven to their strident, alcohol-soaked extremes. All I could think about it was, <i>that's going to alter the game a bit.</i>

What I am unable to understand is the veritable ORGY OF EVIDENCE that has poured forth from the government & the news media regarding this operation. Details which would normally deflected and doused in secrecy are instead paraded forth, with just enough withheld to arouse the casually curious in idle speculation. It's been more than a week, and STILL more details are forthcoming. I know most of my Dear Readers are too young to remember the 1979 effort to rescue the hostages in Iran (under the title Operation Eagle Thrust or some such bombast), but it took dedicated reporters an awful long time to piece together that A) there was an operation, and B)it somehow managed to fuck itself in the ear. 

Now, maybe my trust in the public dissemination of information has been irreparably tarnished by the fact that said providers of information regularly spin the truth so hard that it staggers around afterwards & ends up puking on its shoes. Maybe I've heard too many lies issued regarding paramilitary operations that were later revealed in all their venomous, squirming glory. But this deluge of normally confidential data sounds like a new method for fashioning a cover-up.

Don't get me wrong. Osama is dead. We dumped him in the sea. Some Navy SEAL probably shot him in the eye. 

What I'm saying ~ and what I can't believe no one else has even <b><i>postulated</i></b> ~ is that he was dead when we got there.

Occam's razor alone points glaringly to this. You have a man who has chronic kidney disease (to the point where he needs dialysis on a regular basis) who has been living as a fugitive for nearly a decade. You have an American state department desperately trying to create a back-channel line of reliable intel with a reluctant Pakistan, with almost no success, for nearly as long. You have an American military who is chronically unable (not allowed?) to find Osama. You have a Pakistani intelligence community unable (unwilling?) to locate him, & fully aware of the support he garners in certain sectors of the country. What changed? Under what circumstances would it no longer matter if the Pakistanis ""discovered"" Osama's whereabouts & made that information available for the Americans to discover?

If he was already dead.

There. I've said it. I would like to believe the story that is being enthusiastically and comprehensively shovelled into my craw. In the long run ~ legalistically, operationally, geopolitically ~ it doesn't make any difference. But I can't shake this feeling."

[with all your power, with all your power, with all your power, what would you do?]</b>

In his masterwork of crackpot science <i>Chariots of the Gods?,</i> Erich von Daniken made the (largely absurd) case for the visitation of extraterrestrial civilizations to the Earth in the distant past. These vastly advanced creatures supposedly are responsible for most of the (remarkably primitive) engineering wonders of the ancient world, perhaps going so far as to genetically alter the human genome to a form that was more to their liking, and then departing without leaving so much as a concrete shelter or piece of non-corroding technology behind. According to the author, humans who witnessed these events cowered in terror, watched with wonder, and incorporated what they saw into their mythologies and art styles for millennia.

To support the theory, Daniken points to parallels between accounts and depictions by the ancients of the gods & their deeds, and photos of men in space suits, accounts of nuclear detonations, the mundane wonders of radio, air travel, tv. He points to the remote tribesmen of New Guinea, once visited by US and British soldiers during the Second World War as they built their airstrips to battle the Japanese, and how the tribesmen created a cult around these GI's after their departure, watching the skies, building replicas of airplanes & runways in the hope of enticing back these powerful, exotic visitors.

The argument is poppycock. Still, the author stumbles over a profound, unsettling truth. Our civilization <i>does</i> ascend to the stars in fiery chariots. We <i>do</i> communicate any idea, instruction, or image over vast distances instantaneously. We <i>do</i> have access to flying machines, and weapons capable of terrible annihilation. We <i>do</i> rershape the entire earth after our desires, paving it and extracting from it what we will. We do all these things routinely, easily, even thoughtlessly. 

<b><i>WE</i></b> are the gods the ancients were waiting for. We are the result and culmination of millennia of dreams for godlike powers. If any ancient were to be shown even the basics of American life, they would understand us as keepers of divine might. We are what nine hundred generations of people fantasized about, prayed to for deliverance, worshipped, feared.

And like those gods they believed in, we are almost blind to the capability in our grasp, caught up in endless cycles of squabbling, nesting, scheming, pettiness, distraction. We would seem, to them, to be just as capricious, mean and indifferent as the dieties they were familiar with. Though our technology is godlike, our behavior is much more like the lemurs we descended from, than the angels our powers demand of us. If you are looking for the divine presence in the heavenly chariot, you need only glance in the next lane over on the freeway, trapped in bumper to bumper, chattering about his business into his bluetooth."

"event","<b>A REMINDER: GO EASY ON 'EM</b>

It's the most difficult when you feel blue, to keep a light touch. Sooner or later there comes that time when you feel neglected or isolated or abandoned, and you do the best for yourself but the cheap shots just keep rolling in. And you're sensitized to it, almost looking for it, turning your chin into the expectation of a blow. Because it might mean a chance to fight back, to let the inner animal out of its cage, the joyous rage that comes with tearing something down.

But you have to go easy.

You're aware of more than you know, and you know more than you think. And all the good you do with that, you could do so much more damage. And unlike good, damage is something no one ever forgets. It stalks off on hard, mean boots, and you can't call it back. You can't change your mind and unhurt someone.

Remember that people are fragile, and even when they're handled well they still break so easily. We all get broken sooner or later, sobbing on a curb or staring at nothing with faces lonely as graves. Life teaches its lessons with the subtlety of a tire iron. You don't need to help it along. 

There is much less evil in the world than you wish there was. There are mostly cross-purposes, and mistakes, and misguided intentions. The failure to forgive. And complicating most of these is pride, the high, wobbling pride of a child on his first bike, in love with potency, heedless of consequence. Ask yourself ~ how much evil have <i>you</i> really done?

Well, do you want to add to it now?

So go gentle. Do what you have to, but lay it down carefully, like putting a drunk girl to bed, tucked in soft with a glass of water on the nightstand, a chaste kiss goodnight. Do it for yourself, because you know hatred is a smoldering kind of slavery, a chain that binds you to something that will never give you what you want, and gives it power over you.

They will almost certainly mistake your mercy for weakness. Do it anyway."

<i>Jeffrey, 

I feel a like a bit of a jerk at the moment.  I'm home, alone, not sleepy.  Doing mundane things.  Cleaning out old emails.  I come across one you sent me a long time ago.  It's the last email you sent me at my hotmail address.  It had an attachment.  I clicked the link and Jango radio started to play Stars - Your Ex-Lover is Dead.  Which was so lovely, I immediately bought it.  And signed myself to the radio station.  See, now that I've quit the band, I'm in charge of designing my own sound and destiny.  And you always sent me lovely music, and I was caught up in other things.  I heard the songs, but I'm sorry I didn't give them enough time.  Now I know what I was missing.  I needed to hear that song today.  And I was finally ready for it.  I feel like a fortress has fallen, or a focus has been created, I don't know.  All I do know is that I once thought these songs were pretty and now I can hear things I couldn't hear before.  I feel much more.  You have unwittingly foreseen my soundtrack for 2011.

[i can nearly understand, the main thing]</b>

Your humble narrator has been recommending this piecemeal to everyone he meets who expresses any interest in movies whatsoever, often with the zeal and tactlessness usually reserved for Scientologists whose thetans are ingramming their Marcabs (or however the hell that works). So instead, I've decided to offer it to everyone in a massive spam that will reach all dozen of the people who still come to LJ.

That movie is this ~

<lj-embed id=""26""/>

It's the story of a man who has been grieving over a lost love for several months before the film opens, and in his own words, ""waking up actually hurts."" He decides, very deliberately, to change his life on this day, and we follow him through this day as both he and we discover how this change alters his perspective. The central tension is between the lost past pulling him forever backwards and away, and the vivid promise of life drawing him on.

<i>A Single Man</i> is atrociously, rapturously beautiful, and despite its unquestionable stylishness still tells a story with real depth, poignancy, and mystery. 

Please please see this movie. And if you do (or already have), please please comment on what you thought of it here. I'm curious to see if anyone was as touched by as myself."

[a repost, because i need a prod]</b>

It must be tiring.

How much energy does it take, to keep all that locked up inside you? You clench your jaw shut, your lips a white line to prevent the beauty and conviction inside from spilling out. You walk slouching down the street, concealing a dazzling fire inside a coat you hold closed.

Because it's in you. That lone ability, that solitary grace that shames you so because it isn't more. It burns and whirls and raves in its captivity. Containment takes strength. It takes discipline. And it takes fear. The vague, geopolitical fear of a state in the grip of a cold war, never knowing when the enemy may strike, keeping constant vigilance. The controlling, lurking dread that haunts a warden holding a terrible prisoner. It's in you, and you forbid its release. 

For fear of what might happen, out there, to this precious only treasure you keep. For fear of what might happen to you if it ever got free and lost. For fear of what might happen to your world when it sees the light of day, the transformations that could be wrought by its power.

I imagine the control you must exercise, keeping your face still as emotions pass like great undersea leviathans, without leaving a trace. Holding still instead of striking, silence instead of expression, caution instead of passion. Trying so hard to be the still point in a life that's fully in motion. How much does it cost? How much does it take?

You come home exhausted. You barely muster the energy to get through your routine. When the night comes, you collapse into bed. And while you dream, daybreaks of brilliance peep out from under the blankets."

Who imagines the lives of clouds? Starting as a saltwater haze over a limpid tropical sea, trembling, climbing into the great shimmering vault of sky. What is it like to gain reality from the relief of a cool breeze? Trailing white limbs like gossamer, drifting, remaining formless but gaining substance all the while.

Cruising the wide sky highways, gathering numbers, intersecting, tumbling, interpenetrating and reforming and parting and combining, an orgy of fluff, all the while approaching the great hurdle of a continent.

Then to reach it and break like a wave, thrust up, overpiling, jammed up against the ceiling of space, a great anvil shape trailing ice against the rim of the earth. From below, they appear as an inverted sea, steepening, undulating, deepening, darkening. From above, they are a riot of billows and tufts ripped from a Parrish fantasy, playing with whatever the sun gives them - pearl gold or blinding true white, or, at dusk, scarlet or soft violet or salmon or peach or some twilight color so ephemeral it lacks a name.

Finally, in the night, coming to an end, weighed down with flight and long journeys, a spectacle of days and nights sailing the sky. Emptying themselves in a storm of tears that lack sorrow or joy. The death of clouds is the life of the earth, and the leaves and puddles all whisper the gossip of far-off seas, swirling winds, scorching sunsets. 

The earth is grateful. In the night are those who turn their faces up to feel the clouds kiss their cheeks and eyelids. Others sleep, deep untroubled dreams of love. When the clouds weep, it is because they long to live again.

Puddles. Trickles. Streams. Rivers. The sea. Currents. Heat. Torpor. A shimmering haze rises in the afternoon."

[you can take the future even if you fail]</b>

Stevenson crosses the few blocks from Our Lady to the cafe with the box tucked under his arm, making his way in those few hours between late morning and mid-afternoon when he still has the energy he can remember always having. Those hours are like a gift to him now. The rest of the time he finds he grows tired so easily. Aside from the box, he wouldn't attract attention. But it's a garish orange with a blast of blue graphics on the lid, the logo for a shoe company whose name consistently eludes him, a box that once held sneakers for someone he can only assume was a giant. The box he keeps with him, always.

He has a suitcase, too. But it doesn't come with him. Changes of clothes, a shaving kit, are necessities, a kind of social politeness. Kindly people let him place it for the day here and there ~ the cafe, the post office, behind the doorman's desk at Rue Martine, occasionally with the wizened Father at Our Lady. It rests among their feet like a snoozing cat until he comes back for it. 

The box is different. The box is what Stevenson has left. He had more, much more. A whole house full of things and a garage besides. But the family drained from the house, then the love, then the trappings, then the furniture, and then, finally, Stevenson. It's simple, really, what's tucked under his arm. A scarf. Three books. A painting his child stuck to the fridge. Photos he took travelling. Of his wife. A thumb drive filled with files he hasn't opened in a decade, so obsolete that to port it he needs an adapter that no one ever seems to have. A jade sea turtle, no bigger than his fingernail. A journal he kept in college when his mind was burning. And tucked into the pages of that journal, two letters he can't bear to read or to throw away. A white gold pendant with two pearls, but no chain.

It seems as big, as full as everything else around him. A balance, tiny substance versus meaningless profusion. It seems natural, this slow sloughing off of things, the winnowing away. Others have more use for the rest of it. He forgets himself sometimes, thinking of the contents of the box.

But here he is, crossing the street, glancing up at the poplars lining it, their crowns turning gold while their lower branches blithely continue pretending its summer. What brought him here, back to France and this little city in Provence? Closure? A longing to complete a cycle? Memories? Nostalgia? <i>They might as well be one,</i> he thinks. Here he is, and it doesn't look like he's going much further.

Aurelie finishes tidying up the attic room, gathering up the bed linen, putting the simple array of cookware and flatware back neatly on the shelf above the stove. Collecting the few possessions of Mme Sagnier and putting them in a box, the same box Sagnier brought in with her when she came. It's the same stuff she's used to finding ~ a few trinkets, writings, pictures. She takes care to find them all.

She has nearly a dozen collections like this now. They clutter one wall of her own apartment, but she can't seem to part with them. Sometimes she'll find herself musing over them, trying to imagine their meaning. The enamelled hummingbird brooch. The battered map of Turkey. Aurelie wonders which face she knew in this photograph? Was it the parent or the child?

It's no surprise to her that they're drawn here. They hear about it in the cafe downstairs, perhaps even visit one of the residents during their short tenure. It has a queer reputation; Aurelie has mixed feelings about it, pride mixed with melancholy.

And it's a lovely room, almost quaintly cramped, but streaming with light ~ a little balcony over the street, another window opposite, and the huge skylight, forty eight panes as big as her hand, and after all this time, it heroically refuses to leak. It turns the sky into an aquarium. Most of the furnishings were her mother's, and she supposes that's comforting, too, right down to the blocky microwave and the telephone that's attached to a wire coming out of the wall. Installing the little WC on the landing at the top of the stairs was worth all the effort. <i>Now, if only I could get a month's rent from it,</i> she thinks, rising, hefting the slight weight of Mme Sagnier's things.

She's on the ground floor landing when Jacob pokes his head in from the door that adjoins the cafe. He says, ""Monsieur Stevenson thinks he might like to see the upstairs room.""

Aurelie nods, opening the door to her apartment. Jacob lingers, expectantly. She says, ""He's here now?""

Jacob steps aside to reveal Stevenson standing almost shyly to the side of the counter. And immediately her eyes fall on the box. Of course they do. How couldn't they?

She sets Mme Sagnier's things on a chair just inside, and closes her door. ""Come on through, Monsieur Stevenson,"" she says in her best English, even though his French is quite good. ""It's on the third floor. A bit of a climb, but I think you'll agree it's worth it."""

As your humble narrator makes the effort to post here more regularly, he has wracked his brain for topics of interest. I've turned to my calendar to check out the kinds of things I <i>used</i> to post, when I was updating several times a week, and you know what I found?

I've got nothing to whine about. Right now, it would be like me trying to sing the ""I'm Entirely Too Fortunate To Have The Blues"" blues. But I promise, Dear Reader, that I will try to occupy this space with content worthy of your time. Any requests...?

For now, here are two musical outfits that are blowing my mind & you just might dig. The first is Budos Band, a low-tech funk inspired groove group with more horns than a tricreatops marching band. They will prepare you for, & perhaps inspire you to, all manner of badass muthafuckery:

[you will see, oh now, oh the way i do]</b>

We have lost someone, in the circle I inhabit. It came suddenly & way too soon. I wasn't as familiar with the one we lost as many; still, I see how it has sharpened everyone's sensibilities to the importance of the immediate.

My tribe is scattered now. I think back four years, when we were at our strongest, our most complete (at least through my eyes) & think it wasn't so long ago. Our gathering tonight was as meaningful as it was incomplete. And perhaps it is the historian in me, determined to make a story of it, that sees the rifts & divides & failings that existed in us from the beginning, leading us to where we are now. That the overwhelming energy that made us so brilliant, is eventually what flung us apart. Is it a weakness to grieve that disintegration, to fight the heat death of spreading so far & so thin? 

Because fighting it is what I seem to be doing.

Strangely enough, it seems to be working. The ones I care most about seem to draw closer to me, even as they slip through my fingers. There is so much love for me ~ love like low-hanging fruit, love like a red carpet, love like a jacuzzi. I never expected it, however much I may have loved. I can't tell you how fortunate I feel.

I was raised to see love as a weakness. It never did anything for anyone, except make you a sucker. Dependent, helpless. I was lied to. And now, I find myself amazed, saying <i>This has power? I can make things happen with this? Can I remake the world, the way I want it to be, just by planting these tiny seeds?</i> I was likewise raised to believe power was a hard-boiled thing ~ dominance, force, coercion. The gentleness of the power I'm experiencing, of the power that, to my astonishment, I am wielding, is so gentle ~ like an artist painting light into a darkened scene. 

You must pardon your humble narrator. I speak of love so often. Only because it's such a mystery, still revealing itself to my wondering, almost disbelieving, eyes. I speak of the politics of love, because each would have you believe the other did not exist.

A friend told me tonight that they were going to start blogging again, so that I could keep up with them better, as a kind of tribute to how much they thought of me. I'd be lying if I said that wasn't part of the reason I'm here. And I'd be lying if their sentiment hadn't made me think the same of you, my Dear Reader."

I have been so distant, Dear Reader. How can I explain? If I were to tell you that there is a kind of guilt that comes with happiness, a fear of inflicting it upon the unhappy, a dread that it would seem like gloating... would that even make sense? Because if I were honest, that's all I would have to offer ~ falling into the English way, of feeling only guilt because I feel no pain. It is a lame excuse.

That being said, & the moment being what it is, I declare that I should do all my posting under the influence of a decent quantity of Maker's Mark. That is my truth serum.

It's 2:30 in the morning, & it's still 68 degrees. A good moment for a candlelit sojourn on the porch.

So I shall tell you now that I spent the night out at one of my favorite haunts (Rumours), during one of its most auspicious occasions (Pride), and, well... it felt like old times. And then I came home, & sat on my deck, gazing drunk & emotionally full at the sky, & that also felt like old times. And new times. 

I tilt my head back, and there they are, where they have always been, where as far as I know, they always will be. Stars, planets, the fabulously distant blurry limb of the Milky Way. Comforting & cold as gods. How can I explain to them? Or to you?

I used to feel miniscule and inferior, when I saw you. But that's not true anymore. Even beneath the baleful steadiness of your uncaring glare, I feel worthy. Because I love, and am loved. From the most obvious (like Rachel), to the more oblique like CJ & Malia & Michael, to the inexplicable like Erin whom I barely know, and Kim & Martin & Starrrie who weren't even there ~ I share love. & no matter how eternal or wonderful they are, the stars never felt anything as meaningful.

This is a warm night. I still have a single candle burning.  

I watched a sattelite drift overhead, moving from glaring brilliance into the dimness that resides behind the limb of the Earth. I saw a meteor that did all that in the course of a second.

Being alive is just as profound as being immortal.

As I watched the sky, listening to Yo La Tengo, my eyes sought out the dimmest, most insignificant stars. My irises opened, I saw more & more & more again. If you have the patience for it, you will discover that their light fills every bit of the sky."

If you think you can get to know someone by reading the equivalent of photo captions (often without photo) about their lives, then more power to you. You might also enjoy <i>US Weekly</i>, and get to intimately know some celebrities. I'll stick with it here. There are some people here I don't know any other way than through this site ~ and I'm grateful for them, and it. This is more than a place for people to update where they're going to be tomorrow night/tonight/last night, or what their latest achievement on Farmville might be. People <i>express</i> themselves here ~ what troubles them, where they're going, and what compels them to go there. If you're lucky, you can find strangers and actually become friends, without ever meeting them. That's been a unique experience for me.

And I need to keep up my end.

So let me just say for now that recently, I have been struck by my ordinariness. There is no shame in this feeling, no guilt. Just recognition. Ordinary. Most of us are, but we build these narratives around our ambitions and thoughts and struggles that make us feel like we're in the center of a drama, that something heroic might occur from our actions.

Another casualty of age I suppose, as what you hope to do becomes gradually what you've done. I'm just a guy, with a job, and a girlfriend, who lives simply. I live in the mightiest nation on earth, but it & I have almost nothing to do with one another, incidental contact. We are not so much at cross purposes, as living in different worlds. I have ambitions and dreams for myself like most ordinary people do, and those around me smile and nod when I mention them as you would if you were humoring a mental patient.

I've had some thoughts. I am reluctant to share them. They are big, somewhat complex, and not entirely pleasant. I will probably lay them down here eventually, just to get them out and make room for something else. You have been warned.

I've read some good books. Perhaps I'll tell you a little about them.

I recently returned from LA. I saw my family, which was difficult but fulfilling and necessary. Diana proved yet again how much she deserves to be my best friend, and I love her for it. Rachel and I have been snuggling our way through winter. 

It's not much to tell, but I will tell it, Dear Reader. I will tell it all, and it will take more than 142 characters to do it."

This is something that I haven't seen attempted before ~ grand fantasy on an indie budget. And if you can overlook a little flat acting and some camera hedges that gamely try to hide the shoestring budget, it works. Oh man, does it work. It creates a complex story arc and some of the best visual metaphors I've seen in a long time.

Forget sparkly magic vampires and metadisasters. This is what you really want to see... something you haven't seen before."

"event","<b>GONNA DO MY VERY BEST, & IT AIN'T NO LIE

[if you put me to the test, if you let me try]</b>

Let me start by mentioning how much I love that, when I roll my little pointer up to my userpic of Gregory Peck, it always says ~ flatteringly, reassuringly ~ 'this is you.' Thank you, LJ.

Writing is something of a challenge. Not that I am loathe to do it, Dear Reader. But I've been posting pics for so long, and not really done any solid, old-fashioned navel gazing soliloquies, it's hard to know where to begin.

So let's go ahead and bite at the biggest piece, the most daunting one, right now shall we? The one that I'm most nervous to discuss, because it means the most.

Let's talk about love.

I am in love. I feel pretty confident that my girlfriend Rachel is in love with me. We've made the admission, we both say the words pretty regularly and seem to mean them even more. I don't have to tell you it's a wonderful feeling, to know that you're loved, that someone is looking forward to you like you're Big Manly Sexy Christmas. 

She snuck up on me a bit. I knew we had the chemistry, but honestly I had no idea where that would go. She's adventurous, and honest, and silly, and sincere in a way that is endearingly vulnerable. If you asked me, I'd say those are the things that got me.

But all this is obvious, really. What I really want to tell you is how much the way I love has changed. I imagine most people's approach to love changes as they get older, more experienced. This is mine.

I can only say that is seems more <b><u>sane</u></b> now. There's no lack of passion, but I'm free of those fits of obsessiveness/smothering, and of towering, unsusbstantiated jealousies. Hopefully that means I'm further away from the insecurity that fuels them both.

I'm more fatalistic now, and I have no idea whether that is a good thing or not. Things change, whether we want them to or not, and feelings shift with them. I don't know if it will last. I know now that promises are just breath pushing hope ~ they are meaningful but nonbinding. There's no cause to rest on my laurels, nothing is won and never will be. All I can say right now is that we're winning, and I hope it lasts.

While that may seem like bleak terrain for love to flourish, I can only offer this ~ I try harder because of it. I can't make her stay. I can only treat her in ways that might make her want to. I no longer want to say (or even think) that someone belongs to me. There's something that tastes controlling & possessive about it now. I want to help her be happy with her life, make her feel comfortable and valued and loved.

And it doesn't hurt that when she's happy, she's so pretty. It's like a reward for doing right by her. I'll take it and smoosh it in my arms, because I'm in love, and a fool, and happy."

So that was your humble narrator's summer. It was marvelous, but I must admit that I'm glad it's done. I feel I've spent the last ten weeks at a feast, gobbling every dish, sampling all the novelties. Now, I have a chance to sit back, and digest. Make something of it all. Savor it, and what might be to come. 

Isn't that what autumn is for?

Yes, that's my city under that <i>pee-inducing horror</i> of a mushroom cloud. It was a memorable day.

Back in the day, Rachel used to go swimming in a little place back there called Pixie Pond. After the explosion + fire + poison, the area was understandably off limits for a while. Over the winter, those restrictions appear to have relaxed, and although the trails are utterly erased, we decided to try our luck at getting back to Pixie Pond.

[we can worship pagan idols, there together you & me]</b>

Last week, I took Rachel on her birthday trip (anybody else noticing a trend here?), a surprise run out through Deception Pass to Port Townsend. I've only briefly visited before, and wanted to explore more. Due to my getting taking a wrong turn, we got there a little later, and didn't have much time. But I think we made the most of the few hours we had. I'll let you be the judge.

Besides, with a trip like this, the travel is better than half the fun. <u>WARNING: lots of pretty pictures, which are awesome and will make you want to look at them. So there.</u>

So that's been the adventures of the last month. And now tomorrow I'll have another one, if weather permits. If it does not permit, I will still have an adventure, but it will be more of the sensually-tangled-bedclothes variety ~ and there will be fewer pictures. Tough luck."

Two weeks ago, I took Kerry on her birthday trip. We ran over to the market & threw together a spontaneously sumptuous lunch ~ egg salad sandwiches, herb crackers & smoked cheese, strawberries, and a hazelnut cake/chocolat mousse/fudge fondant baked concoction called a hedgehog. Then we were off, up the Ski-to-Sky Highway, to Shannon Falls. We ate our lunch basking in its sight and sound, then approached it with our cameras like ardent, worshipful acolytes.  

There comes a point, when you're shutterbugging away at something you feel very passionate about, when it goes beyond recording or artfully capturing, and it turns into something lusty and obsessive and greedy and frankly, just a bit creepy. This time around, Kerry & I dubbed it ""<b><i>waterfall porn,</i></b>"" and be warned, Dear Reader, because you are about to be drawn into its gushing, fluming, cascading, liquid depths.

[yes, i see the cities by the sea]</b>

Well, work was long and brutal and difficult tonight, and I left things in a way that almost ensures that it will be long and brutal and difficult tomorrow. So in response, I am going to light my candle lantern and sit on my back porch, drink several beers, lounge in the warm breezes taking bad pictures of the elusive moon, and listen to <i>Treasure</i> by the Cocteau Twins until I am ready to pass the fuck out. Give me, like, forty minutes.

But first, for you, Dear Reader ~ more pictures!

I feel it is incumbent upon your humble narrator that he should make known all the distractions in his life for the last several weeks, distractions that have kept him from dispatching his duties to you, Dear Reader, in a timely fashion.

Seeing as this is mixed company, I will leave out the ""R"" (or NC-17, or XXX for that matter) rated anecdotes. Rest assured, however, that those little romps consume time and passion like a furnace, and its exhaust consists of luxurious sighs.

But in the course of the next few days, I will post pix of where I have been, and what's been there that was worth looking at. I hope you will find them distracting, as well.

There's a fat moon over the pond tonight, and through the summer-tall reeds, the water doesn't so much glimmer as hint at gleaming, deep and alluring as sin. Croakings, burpings, barkings, chirpings rise from the water's edges like so much gas. It's an amphibian happy hour. It's a meet market. It's prom night. It's the 'casual encounters' section of craigslist. Despite all the noise, you never see the males at all. They are boastful, concealed, exhibitionist, mysterious, just like any sexually hopeful male wishes he could be.

Suddenly, the pond goes quiet. Perhaps passing headlights have swept over it. Perhaps someone walked by. Perhaps there was an owl lurking, or a cat.

But somewhere in the reeds, half-submerged, a lady frog strains into the silence, aching for the chorus to begin again, her body thinking <i>the first one who calls out will be my lover.</i>

[sextown usa we can go here or there it all becomes sextown usa]</b>

It occurs to me that I've failed in posting much in the past month. That is most remiss of me, Dear Reader, and I apologize. I'll make it up to you, promise. There's pictures behind the cut!

The fact is, other things have been consuming most of my time and thoughts... and I've been stymied about how to write about them here, and not act like a complete douche.

But fuck it. Chips, fall where you may ~

Starting pretty much since I've returned from Hawaii, I've been having sex. 

No, that doesn't quite cover it.

<b><i>I'VE BEEN HAVING SEX!!</b></i> Weekly extended sessions of enthusiastic, playful, sweaty, ridiculously uninhibited carnal gratification! I've lucked into a partner who is as deep into the <i>fun</i> of sex as I am, & shares a few of my kinks (best if you don't ask). The body as playground, an instrument for producing pleasure. Hedonistic? You bet. But also some of the goddamnedest, passionate sexplay I've ever been involved in. The kind that leaves you shuddering randomly for minutes after you actually cum, like a Chrysler running on bad gas.

And of course there is a relationship that goes along with all this fucking. So far everything's gelling pretty well between us, in & out of bed. We went for an impromptu pre-season camping trip up Church Mtn Road during my last days off, and had a tremendous time. She wanted to take me up there and test out her equipment. Er, yeah. 

But I don't want to get ahead of myself. When things started happening, I made this kind of vow that I wasn't going to do what your Humble Narrator is so notorious for doing ~ letting my fancy get the better of me, and not paying enough attention to what was actually happening. I told myself that I wasn't going to convince myself this was anything it wasn't, or deny that it is something that it is. I was just going to be honest, upfront, and let it roll.

It's working. I hope it keeps doing that. I'm having a great time!

[i went out to the country park & hung around til after dark til the girls got home, til the girls got home]</b>

It was the birthday of <lj user=""michaelocalypse""> tonight, and I went out to celebrate it. We are reverse birthday twins ~ his 24 to my 42 ~ and if there is anything I would like to engrain within him, it's that he will realize how admirable and capable he is before he is thirty. It will save him so much time that I wasted. I'd like to spare him that. Consider it my gift to you, if you can take it.

I recognize spring, starting tonight. No longer a potential, a longing of winter to melt away, not a crest on a horizon, but something immediate,  already washing over us, we watch the trees bud & blossom in the wavering currents, sea fans white and pink and shedding their petals like snow candy. The frogs still chirped in the reeds when I got home, songs to a moon not yet deflated, still ripe with light & promise.

For so long, I was such a champion of romantic love. And there was already someone waiting there, clucking their tongue and telling me in a sympathetic and only slightly condescending tone, ""Oohhhh, no no no, it doesn't work that way, sorry."" I ignored it & charged forth, only now recognizing that it never really worked, and that I was the only one who believed in it. I refuse to say that I am wrong, out of zeal or pride or perhaps simply spite. But I will admit that maybe I actually know nothing, that I would do better to just pay attention to moments, rather than attempting to attach them to an ideology, however beautiful... the moments or the ideology. I just don't know any more. & that will have to be okay.

Taoism teaches us to be like water, and I accept that teaching, in that I will let myself flow, and seek my own level. Tonight, so many people received what I have to give, and I gave it, not trying to direct or categorize it. It's been that way for a few weeks now. And the thing is, <i>it works.</i> And it feels good.

I just dropped off a girl with a long cascade of teal blue hair. It's as beautiful as it was unexpected. I think people who are miserable with their lives are maybe not paying enough attention to them, how they surprise, how they shift. They may not offer what you expect, or even what you thought you wanted, but there's always something there for you.

That's what spring feels like. There's something out there for you. You can catch a hint of it in the drifting breeze that comes up after midnight. It's sweet and barely there. It will haunt you, if you let it."

"event","<b>YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY MY ATTIC HAS ITS CHARM, & THAT YOU DID NO MAJOR HARM

[you can always say that, you can always say that, oh spare me if you please]</b>

Two points drew more than a line for me tonight.

The first, a couple looking at colors, their little girl sitting in the child seat in the cart. The couple held the color cards up between themselves & the girl, in a fan, as if they were playing poker against her, comparing tones to a pillow or something, engrossed. And the girl sat up straight, hands wrapped around the rail, fully attentive, gazing quietly and solely at them, with a slightly unhappy, yearning expression that was emotionally singular and complete and heart-shattering to me.

I've seen so many kids do so much crap to get attention. Squawking like peacocks. Throwing things. Deliberate misbehavior. And the perennial, ""Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. <i>Mom. Mom. <u>Mom.</u></i>"" But here was this kid, waiting patiently for attention that, as the minutes stretched out longer and longer, must have seemed like it was never going to come. The couple eventually made their way over to me to order, but they never did glance at her.

I wondered for a little while why that was so wrenching for me. But of course it was obvious. I was that kid, so often. I remember following my mom through the K-Mart, keeping a close eye on her, certain that if I fell out of sight that she wouldn't notice I was gone. I waited for my turn, which sometimes would not come. I sat up straight in the cart and held the rail and was desperately patient. I was that kid. Sometimes, I still am.

Later, at lunch, I was reading a book and fell across a line that hit me so square in my chest-clock that I read it at least a dozen times before I could move on. It was a toss-away line, buried in a conversation, presented as matter-of-factly as the necessity of breath: 

""Well, every artist, every performer, has an origin in neglect.""

We make these testaments, these expressions, because at the beginning it was the only loophole in the Immutable Grownup Law of <u>Wait Your Turn</u>. It seemed at the time that drawing Magic Marker pictures of dinosaurs descending the ramps of flying saucers was the only way to say <i>notice me</i> without throwing cantaloupes in the supermarket.

Then it becomes a habit. Even now.

Maybe she will be a painter, when she gets older. Her pallette consisting of grays and blacks and stark brilliant whites, sensing that color is an old enemy without exactly remembering why.

Before they left, I gave her a Mickey Mouse sticker. It's all I had. 
<i>I see you.</i>"

"event","<b>HOUSE BURNT DOWN</b>

My computer caught a virus, and after several misguided, vainglorious attempts to fix it myself, it bricked on me. I ended up taking it in. All my file access tags had been corrupted to the point where they were no longer readable by any of the programs i had. Or, it turns out, that the repair shop had.

I lost a lot of things. The one that hurts the most is that I lost all my photos. There are a lot I've posted to photobucket, but it's still just a pittance of the pretty stupidity I've aimed my camera at. I try not to think about it too much. All my ""important"" (completed, longer) writing work has long ago been backed up to disk. But my short stuff ~ notes, harebrained concepts, and such ~ have returned to the ether. I feel sheepish now that I was so shy about posting my silly erotica to the internet, or even granted it the importance to back it up. Now that it's gone, I realize that it wasn't half bad.

And just to prove that I am a slavish bitch to my technology, I also acquired a virus a couple weeks ago. I was very sick, but I'm mostly better now.

I don't want to spend this entire post moping, or even making it sound like I am moping. Events have taken more exciting turns than a Grand prix circuit in the last few weeks. And even though my internet access was gone for a while, it was replaced by intensely exciting forms of amusement that make it pale by comparison. 

This post was mostly to explain my (probably unnoticed) absence to you, Dear Reader. Don't think I was ignoring you.

But here's the thing ~ I don't think I'll be backlogging my f-list to catch up. In keeping with the scorched-earth nature of my latest computer adventure, I think I'll start fresh with wherever it is now. No looking back."

[& it won't be me]</b>

I had no real intention of socializing tonight*, but I did (more than I anticipated) and I found some things out I wouldn't have otherwise.

I've been out of touch. Sure, I was in Hawaii, but I've been ""away"" much more than that. Now I find that I've been insulated, heavy shit has been going down in my absence, some so heavy it's barely discussed even now. Where have I been? I feel something like a shit.

The consolation is this: Hawaii has made my heart quiet. I can't describe it any other way, & if you don't get what I'm saying, Dear Reader, then I am sorry, truly. I am quiet, inside. There is only one other thing in my life I can count on to leave me feeling like this, and right now she is 1000 miles away. 

So I have been reintroduced to this environment littered with troubled people, challenged people, scared people, broken people. And I'm actually in a position to do them some good ~ moral support if nothing else, more if they need it. I'm noticing more how life will do this, if you let it... bring someone freshly filled and someone running on empty together, just to allow for that opportunity. A chance to balance things out. Maybe it will happen, or not. Mostly depends on the disposition of the parties involved. But the opportunity is placed before us. I don't know if I recognized this before now.

Now if only Starrrie makes it up this weekend, it will be complete. Everyone else gets their rudder, & I get mine. 

The currents of life are subtle and deep. They don't even cause a ripple.

"event","<b>I AM CONVINCED THAT SOMEWHERE, THIS CAT ACTUALLY EXISTS

[plus some nanotech paranoia]</b>

The first thing I recall in this dream is watching an advertisement on a screen as large as a movie theater's. In extreme closeup, someone is pouring dust ~ so fine it behaves almost like fluid ~ from a pipette directly into an open, upturned eyeball. The dust soaks into the eye like soil flung onto a pond. The background is white and overlit and impeccably clean.

""If you blink,"" says a charming male voice-over, ""we made it too big.""

The dust is a million nanotech cameras, which gaily colored computer animations show settling into a lattice inside the eye, then sending electrical impulses directly to the brain. It corrects nearsightesdness, farsightedness, color blindness, and astigmatism. And according to the placating voice, if you use a device that looks like a bluetooth earpiece, you can digitally record what you see, effectively turning your head into a camcorder.

All this horrifies me.

I go out into the hall of my apartment building, and head down to my friend's place. To one side of his door is a line of people, stretching down the hall and around the corner, like they're waiting to get into a club. I know they're all just waiting to see him. I also know that when he emerges from his apartment, he will simply wave and smile a friendly smile, and walk away from them.

I step to the door and walk right in. He lives in a huge studio, where the living/kitchen area is separated from the bedroom area by a massive hardwood post and lintel archway. He's sitting on the leather couch and says hey and we talk about some plans we made while I cross the space. I don't remember exactly what our plans were, because I'm noticing the two strikingly attractive women in his place, one seated next to him on the sofa, the other perched on the edge of the bed, flipping through a magazine, facing him.

There's an old papasan chair that I sit in, and I remember that some girl brought it in with her a while back, when she was trying to surreptitiously move in, one piece at a time, until he gently stopped her. She was a lot like these two, I'm guessing, and I don't blame them. My friend is beautiful. He's six foot four and slender, graceful, with longish feathery blonde hair like a surfer, brown eyes with huge, doe-like lashes, ruddy cheeks and a smile that is wide but somehow humble, genuine. <small>(I'm drawing not a little bit on my co-worker Ben & an old college friend Perry to patch this dreamwork together)</small> He always looks calm, at peace. He was a magazine model before he came to college.

As we talk, the girl on the couch edges closer to him, the laptop on her thighs bobbling when she moves, her feet angling on the coffee table. He's buried in a massive textbook, with a title like <i>Chemical Properties of Industrial Plastics</i> or some shit. He's having at it with a highlighter pen. I tell him in ominous tones about the nanocameras. He nods, and seems pretty jazzed about it.

The girl on the bed chimes in. ""I heard that soon you'll be able to hook the headset up to your PC, and stream movies directly onto your eyes!"" I look at her dubiously. She glances my way, discards me. If it were possible to visually crumple someone up and toss them in a wastebasket, she just did it. She goes back to gazing at him, picks at the bedspread.

""Stupid paper,"" the girl on the sofa says, seemingly to her laptop. She sets it aside and stands, stretches, showing off her belly to him. ""Do you have any ice cream?""

""I dunno,"" he replies. ""You're always the one who brings it over.""

She crosses to the kitchen. I pick up a magazine which appears to be composed entirely of ads for men ~ watches, shoes, cologne. He looks up from his book to the girl on the bed. ""You feeling okay now?""

""I guess so,"" she says. ""I'm so tapped out, though. I might need a nap later,"" her eyes averting meaningfully from him to the bedspread, which she continues to pluck.

""Sure, fine,"" he motions vaguely, stands up, heads toward the bathroom. He says to me with a laugh, ""I swear, this is the place where all the angry blonde girls end up."" He opens the bathroom door to reveal a girl seated in a lotus on a yoga mat on the floor. My eyes immediately notice her brownish nipples. ""What the hell are you doing in here?!"" he says.

""I always meditate in the nude,"" she says innocently, tipping her chin up at him. ""It helps calm me down."" Her eyelids go <i>batt-batt-batt</i>.

""Yeah whatever,"" he says. ""Just let me know when you're done, okay? I gotta pee."" He turns and shuts the door on her crestfallen face. 

He reutrns to the sofa and sits at the same time as the girl who has returned from the kitchen with a bowl of ice cream. I try to ask him if he finds it worrying to replace your primary perception with electronics. The girl on the couch isn't interested. ""Share,"" she demands, and he good-naturedly lets her feed him a spoonful. I wonder if any of them remember that he has a girlfriend already, not too far away, in Spokane or Portland or something like that. He goes to see her twice a month. It's no secret. They probably do.

I glance down at one of the ads in my magazine. ""Who's the Marlboro Man?""

""Cameron Brody,"" he replies, and I note that it sounds like a male model's name. I tell him that he could be a Marlboro Man himself pretty soon. The girls nod encouragingly. He explains that you have to be at least 35 to be the Marlboro Man, it's something that normally caps a career rather than sparks it. Besides, he jokes, he'd have to spend a lot more time in the sun getting leathery.

The door bursts open and another pretty, fiery girl storms in, tossing her head and gesturing hugely. ""My goddamn boyfriend! Jesus fuck! All he does is write write write, he'll hardly even look at me. But this chick in his class starts talking to him and all of the sudden they're <i>collaborating</i>,"" this she says with eyeroll and finger quotes. ""Fucker! Doesn't he know how that looks to me? Doesn't he fucking care?!""

He's stood up during this tirade, palms out, mollifying. Suddenly she is spent. She sidles closer, arms at her side like a little girl. ""He hurt me,"" she says. He looks at me again, ""All the angry blonde girls, I don't know what it is about this place,"" he says and draws her into a hug.

<i><u>You're in it,</u></i> I think, looking at them as he rests his chin on the top of her heard and shuts his eyes, stroking her back. Her eyes are still open, and there's a secret, triumphant little grin on her face. The other two women glare at her. I flip through the magazine, wondering how far beyond my paradigm all this seems to me. On the page is an ad for the nanocameras, a docile medico injecting them into someone's happy eye. It's hideous. I try to figure out if he sleeps with these girls on the sly, if it's all a big secret that only I don't know about. I try to calculate how much viagra spam they could download into your eyes before you went blind. I shudder a bit."

[of nothing in particular]</b>

Tonight brings the first stormwind that feels anything like spring. It's just a rumor, but if you lean into it, you can smell green. I stood on the porch listening to my windchimes compose their thoughtlessly perfect nonsense music.

I started the year with no prospects, and now... there are (maybe) some. I don't know much what to make of them yet ~ I feel like I had very little to do with bringing it about, other than responding when the appropriate moments presented themselves. Is that all there is to it? I've been plotting entirely too much.

This situation makes any notions of loneliness and the heart... not more achy, really. But more poignant. I've been cruising with my heart on autopilot for the last year, I notice. Now I have to take stock, dust the damn thing off, and figure out <i>yet again</i> what my relationship with it is like.

I suspect that for the longest time, my heart & my dick have been wired entirely too close together to be healthy for a male. And what makes me think this is that the women I pursued last year were quite a bit less romantic & sensitive than I am. That can't be good. But I found I respected their attitude, and am starting to adopt it ~ <i>I'm just trying to get what I want, & right now I want your attention, but if you get your heart mixed up in it? that's <u>your</u> damage, don't get it on me.</i> Replace the word 'attention' with the word 'body,' and I'm pretty much there.

There's something a little insulting in being too considerate of someone else's feelings, almost as if you feel they can't look after themselves. I never looked at it like that before, but now the mild scorn of some of the rejections I've received in the past make sense. As long as I'm honest and upfront, I can ask or suggest whatever I want. If she doesn't agree, I can trust her to say so. After all, a little backbone, a little courage, is something I find so appealing. Why not trust it to come out?

I've been doing some kind of bullshit projection, worrying when getting involved about not hurting someone, about whether I'm leading them on, about being too aggressive, about how involved they're getting. When all the while, <i><b><u>I</u></b></i> was the one who was falling. Then would come the moment when I would express all my big stupid <i>feeeeeeeeeeelings</i>, and they'd be all ""Dude, we're just making out, what's your deal?""

It's kind of liberating, only taking responsibility for my own feelings & behavior. I hope I'm not wrong about this.

In the same way they came into my life, I have to let these things sort themselves out. My only point right now is to shape things up the way I want them to go, pay attention to who these women are turning out to be to me, and ~ like before ~ when the moment comes, <i><b>pounce.</b></i>

Just got home from fetish night, which despite the number of people who failed to make an appearance, was wonderful just the same.

Over the course of my carousing, I was told by several ladies that I was being bad, or mean, or evil. These same ladies looked at me as if I weren't any of those things, at all.

I can't imagine what Lenora ~ who I just met ~ must think of me. I never thought of myself as the Bad Man, but when I think of the women I sent home with shining eyes and lascivious thoughts... when did I become wicked? Why don't I feel wicked, in that I don't feel guilty in the least bit, for any of it?

They say the Devil makes his way by convincing you to do exactly what you want to do. & now I'll go to bed wondering, is it really so bad, being bad? Maybe the Devil needs a new publicist."

So for the 3rd time in 2 weeks, some attractive woman I have known & lost contact with has strolled into my workplace. Not to seem ungrateful , but WTF? Really? This one I recognized but barely recalled ~ we only met a couple of times, two years ago ~ at the periphery of our respective groups ~ and she went to lengths to remind me of them. I was a little embarrassed as memories flowed back in; I won't forget her again.

And was that... flirting? & was that her, flirting back? What? At least I had the presence of mind to get her number, despite my shock. It's not a promise, but it is promising. Just when I was feeling 'meh' about the whole thing.

At times I think the universe is more concerned with my well-being than I often give it credit for. My standing position is that it is completely indifferent. Jury's still out, but this recent streak has been duly noted."

"event","<b>THOUGHT THERE'D COME A DAY I'D RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY

[but now i know it's true, no one listens anyway-hay, <i>yeah!</i>]</b>

""What makes you write?"" I got asked, and for a full minute I was unable to articulate an answer. It turns out, he was actually trying to ask me <i>would you rather be rich or famous?</i> and I should've expected as much; he's very rewards-oriented. But your humble narrator is much more internal, and a pretty obsessive bastard, and thus has been turning this question over for a full day.

So, for the none of you who asked, here's what I came up with. Despite the fact that it has turned out to be the longest-running failure of my life, I continue to write because it helps me figure out my life, however obliquely. The main trouble I have with life is that I love things way more than they love me, probably more than they <i>can</i> love me, because I am an idealistic, sentimental idiot that entertains all manner of cockamamie notions about how love could transform life into something without so many limits. But there are just enough people out there to whom this attitude looks like an endless gravy train suckerfest, that I've had to learn to <i>temper</i> my feelings, and try to adapt. I don't think I'm alone in this.

For the most part, that's why my characters suffer. That's why they lose so often. An inability to adapt, to temper, to cope. Perhaps my lack of happy endings will be my undoing, rendering me unfit for public presentation. Well, so be it, I guess. I don't have anything else that compels me to write about it. That's where my truth is. Maybe I'll end up like Henry Darger, privately crooning over his Vivian Girls, casting frolics & battles over yards of butcher paper. 

Writing's the only thing I think I do particularly well, and it is the only thing I've set myself to that I've wanted to excel in. I'm no tortured artist. I'm not even an artist. I'm more like a mason than a sculptor. What I do may not make you sigh, but you can live in it. I tell stories. And I try to make those stories honest, even when everything in them are completely egregious and unapologetic lies.

Ever since I can remember, I've struggled to make myself clearer, to make what you read off my page more lucid, to say what I mean. But with this most recent piece, I came to realize that all of that kind of missed the point. Two of the characters spend most of the time <i>avoiding</i> saying what they mean, lives of obfuscation, subterfuge, fishing for what others think by flirting with the truth, escaping responsibility by never committing or rejecting or admitting a thing. It wasn't hard to find models for these people. The third character is straightforward and earnest. He loses.

You may appreciate someone who speaks plain & clear. You might like, or even respect them. But what I've learned is that people who speak amorphously, who only hint at a great show without ever really pulling up the curtain... they <i>fascinate</i> you. You love them, the mystery of them. You almost can't help yourself.

& so I clack away, hoping that, instead of trying to teach you anything new, I might help you remember something important that maybe you've forgotten. I love words, the endless invention of them, that they can make dialogues, ideas, rules, sex, puzzles, worlds, impossibilities. I try to get better, closer to home, more like life, more subtle, more precise. But this post is way longer than I intended it to be, so maybe I'm not even very good at that."

My weekend was good. On wednesday night I got together with Wes & Michael & we all ate quesadillas & watched <i>High Plains Drifter</i>, followed by conversation and the descent into online sketch videos. Good times ~ I think we could all afford to macho it up a bit more regularly. On thursday I went to see <i>Frost/Nixon</i>, which is as good as everyone says it is (Frank Langella holy crap), then went out to dinner with cj. While I was loitering around waiting for her, I bumped into Kim, which was wonderful. We caught up a little bit, and then cj showed up and we all chatted for a minute or two, mostly about watching Disney videos. We're dorks. 

cj's able to initiate the most wonderful conversations ~ conspiracy theories and activism and the implications of levitating scottie dogs. She's endlessly interesting; I hope she feels the same about me. I try to keep up, & even throw in my own stuff. Nothing's off the table, which is how conversation should always be. The older I get, the less use I have for politeness. I'm going to do what I can to get/keep these guys & girls in my life ~ I've had them on the periphery for so long and, they are <i>amazing</i>.

At lunch today, I was walking across the parking lot, and I slowed to stop and stared. It was sunset, and a bank of low puffy clouds was almost directly overhead, a wall of pastel violet and its leading sunward edge a lambent peach froth. Beyond that, a chalky flat of blue sky, the orange sun winking on the horizon. I wish I'd had my camera ~ I know some skywatchers here that would've appreciated it. I gawked, strangely satisfied in an animal way. The sun was back. It was after five pm, and it <i>wasn't even dark</i>.

Most of what makes me up is very old, and responds to very basic things. I have this tottering superstructure of ego and learning and clever that likes to pretend that it's in charge & O so <i><u>important</u></i>, but if it came to a showdown between the mind that intrigues or the body that breathes, I know which ass would get kicked. This newfangled world deserves a more modern model than it got with me. Might as well be draggin a club.

For the last few nights, I've been having recurring sensuous (but not quite erotic) dreams about one particular person. And that person is Colleen McMurphy ~ Dana Delany's character from <i>China Beach</i> ~ a long-ago silly crush I'd forgotten all about until I started dreaming about her making sultry eyes & nuzzling me EVERY DAMN NIGHT.

That's her on the left, and she's just my type of kryptonite. It may not look like her threat level is that high, <lj-cut text=""but no, yeah, then there's that""><a href=""http://s231.photobucket.com/albums/ee182/azuresky_photo/?action=view&current=dd1-sized.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i231.photobucket.com/albums/ee182/azuresky_photo/dd1-sized.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a></lj-cut>. 

This is further complicated by the fact that recently, my body's memory of what it's like to have sex is entirely too vivid to be comfortable. I try to tell it that there's really nothing to be done right now, but it just goes on reminiscing in its distracting, futile way. It leaves behind a troublesome feeling that is flat and smooth and cool as a freshly disinfected countertop. Who knew that this kind of burning would give off so little heat?

<i>O, I got a zoo, I got a menagerie, inside my ribs, under my bony head, under my red-valve heart - 
and I got something else:
it is a man-child heart, a woman-child heart: it is a father and mother and lover:
it came from God-Knows-Where: it is going to God-Knows-Where -
For I am the keeper of the zoo:
I say yes and no: I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world:

Saw <i>Revolutionary Road</i> last week & been meaning to post about it since. Brilliant, rough, emotional film. I think it should be mandatory for every 20-year old, perhaps kick-starting some discussion about what they want out of life, and the peril of not thinking about it. Thought the ending went a little Thomas Hardy, author-as-magical-enforcer-of-victorian-moral-justice (hm, doesn't look like a spoiler), but otherwise gripping & magnificently acted. Came out feeling like I dodged a bullet, lifewise (although if I had a wife who believed in me half as much as she did him, I would be luckier than I have ever been in love). Still madly in love with Kate Winslet (<i>dancing in a ponytail! *~sigh~*</i>), and covet every article of clothing Leo diCaprio wore:

Went to Steve's crossdressing birthday party. Sorry, could not X-dress as came directly from work. At first I was very uncomfortable, as I didn't know hardly anyone there, and seemed to be the only one who didn't. I am still shy in situations like that, don't know what to do. I was preparing to leg it, when a bunch of people I knew (& dig) showed up. Made it better. Steve has tremendous birthday party ideas ~ I hope he enjoyed it as much as everybody else seemed to. His tiara was so very very pretty. Oh, & Jade should wear neckties more. Hm. Or maybe she shouldn't...

My romance with winter is officially over. It's too cold to play outside, the days are too short, and nothing green is growing out of the ground. Sick of it. Sleepy when I shouldn't be, lazy when I shouldn't be, lonely when I shouldn't be. I've taken to escaping, pixel dreams in my hibernation, sweating it out with elliptical and dumbbells rather than climbing something tall. It keeps me going, but it's just substitution. Escaping is an addiction ~ it takes more & more to get the same high I would get out of just one summer afternoon on the mountain. Glare at the calendar & countdown Hawaii.

One thing I still enjoy which is wintertimey is the birds (& squirrels {& once a raccoon even!}) that come to my balcony because I give them seeds to eat. I especially get a kick out of waking up in the morning & seeing birds huddled like disgruntled hobos under the feeder, because it is empty, and eyeballing my door.

Ducked into a drug store today to get something, and found my eyeballs being savagely & pinkly bludgeoned by V-Day falderall. Had forgotten all about it til then. One nice thing about being an underconsumer who is underexposed to media ~ you remain blissfully ignorant of shit that has nothing to do with you. I really didn't need that. It made me bitterly irritated, and that's the last way I want to feel about the lovey-dovey stuff. It's so stilted, forced, stuntlike... less Don Juan, more Evel Kineval. Do not want.

I would only amend that I reserve the right to make many stupid mistakes, and to laugh openly at my earnestness at any time.

Ridiculously, at some point during the evening I was sat alone between Erin & Jade. HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN?? How lucky am I?

It's their eyes. Goddammit. Animated, flashing. At moments serene. And then they smile, gathering all that vivaciousness up like goddesses, and turn it like a searchlight onto me. On a jamoke like me. Seriously ~ whatever I did to deserve this, I hope I keep doing it. If only there were words.

The other day, someone from my past walked into my life, right there at work. Her name is Tammy, & she was one of our ""couple"" friends back when I was married and we hung mostly with other couples, as couples do. She was the girlfriend of Hacksaw, & he & my wife and a couple others had been bandmates previously and were still pretty tight. So Tammy & I were kind of thrown together on the periphery, and though we were/are both quiet people, we clicked.

We talked books, I helped with her horses. We flirted outrageously, because frankly, there was nothing else we could do about that. Tammy is super centered and confident, she had this proud, daring, level look she could lay on me, and I swear she could see every slinky little inkling in my mind. I would vibrate inside, while I gave that look back just as hard as I could. It was <i>fun</i>.

We haven't seen each other since shortly after my divorce, which was eight years ago, I guess. I'd heard she'd broken up with 'Saw, & hooked up with somebody & moved deep into the County. Now she's back, for whatever reason, and in the Depot fixin' up the joint. So we chatted for a few minutes.

Situations like this always accentuate the passing of time. We both have most of a decade on us, and although it's completely mysterious, we both have changed. Subtly but certainly, like the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. She's pushing fifty now, and when she gave me the Look, I saw something (maybe) softened there a bit, (maybe) wondering if she could still do it. Maybe a bit shy? It was alarming and endearing to me. Maybe it's how I've changed that I see her that way now, less intimidating and more human.

She's got no reason to shy up though. When her green eyes turn on me, Tammy still makes me thrum. She's something else."

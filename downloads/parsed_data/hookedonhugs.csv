And since it IS florida, its always going to be extremely hot outside and by that time, I had already ran out of water.

Anyway. So I hope the fence and take off my clothes, and just while i'm unsnapping my bra, I look in the water and see a pair of eyes, then another pair.

2 gators the size of me maybe even bigger are snakin in the water just staring at me.

Good thing I looked into the water before jumpin in. I mean shit, I don't think I could ride my bike with just one leg."

"event","is sorta dull.

Some moments were a blast. But mostly..A dull life of smoking pot and doing nothing.

I've been planning a trip to the beach. But somehow, Something always intervenes.

Whether it be my bike breaking, a family member passing away, or some other sort of interruption that seems to keep me from my destination.

But heh, My bike is fixed. So getting some sun shouldn't be a problem tomorrow.

I've been dating lately, which really isn't all that interesting. But its a change. Shes pretty awesome, i don't think I could have found a more perfect person, and she doesn't even smoke pot. Heh. so this should be a different experiance.

But uh, Yah. So, My best dawg may be commin back to town. So maybe i'll find my sense of adventure again. And enjoy my summer in florida again.

But w.e.

I'm getting a camera. Because I think pictures say alot more than words. So fuck typing from now on.

Peace."

I'm chillin at the nude beach here in miami, making an attempt to get tan.

When 3 fat, middle-aged, hairy, small penis'd mexicans come up to me and start smiling and talking to me.

Well, Of course, Those fuckers only spoke spanish, and don't understand that their fat ass is blocking my sun light, and they start starring at me.

I swear, If I had a nickel for every time a fat naked mexican stared at me.

I'd have 3 nickels."

Its gettin to that cold season again.

Last year was amazing, so this year should be twice as great.

School is going...Ok. Major improvment, but if I want to graduate, i better study hard :/

I've missed 2 days of school this week. I need a break. Its stressful.

But hopefully, when i come back, i'll be able to focus on homework.

Later."

I didn't go to school today.

I can't breath. I feel like my uterus is ten times its actual size and its trying to burst out.

I took some pills, but they really arent helping. Stupid generic ibprofin (sp?).

I hate life.

Fuck you!"

Rosa had her baby, so i stayed at her house most of the weekend.

After a funfilled couple of days including: Lack of sleep, and thinking the cat was tripping on acid, I'm ready for a good rest.

Today was boring...I slept from about 3 till now. 

and i'm probably just going to go back to bed.

I don't work till saturday, so during the week i'm going to be searching for a new job."

I don't even know when i'm supposed to pick up my schedule.

The point is, i'm not looking forward to ANY of it.

I just wish I could graduate now and get it over with.


School is bullshit, and busses are overrated pieces of shit that deserve to be driven to the fuckin junk yard.

Probably get a better education from the bus driver than from the teachers at FPC.

Whatever."

"event","What a great couple days. 

Monday I woke up and started riding my bike. I stopped by work to pick up my paycheck and saw Matt, the food prep guy. I told him I was heading to St. Augustine and he asked if I wanted to hang with him and his GF.

So, I met up with them at matanzas beach, and watched Ian surf for a bit, kicked back, had a couple beers, and smoked a little. They made me feel so welcomed. Later, we all rode back to matt's house and sat by the bonfire just jamming out on acoustic guitars and dreaming loudly.

I left soon after, the shitty thing is, halfway home my handlebars broke.

So I walked home in the dark. I get home and fall asleep as soon as my head hit the the sheets. 



Tuesday, i walked back to the hammock, and got burnt to a crisp at the beach. 

A few hours go by and I start walking back to JT's. After i'm about half way there, some old women pulls up and offers me a ride.

I get in and she drives off.

Its amazing how people always think the worst out of hitch hiking. She seemed to be like the typical crazy grandmother that most people have.

And to be honest, I've never met a kinder woman..

She mostly just bragged about her grandkids.



She parked in the back parkinglot and gave me a bottle of water telling me that I reminded her of her grandaughter.

Her name was Diane."

I havent really adapted that concept completely over the past year..

I'd ignore homework, all the plans I had were left unfufilled (sp).

So...Its time for a change :)

No more being lazy.




Glutony and sloth wasn't really my cup of tea anyway."

"event","So. I've been sleeping for the past 5 hours. Sounds like a waste of a great saturday huh?

But...its actually kinda nice. The past few days i've been drained at work because I havent gotten enough rest.

In fact, they are starting to think that I'm narcoleptic(sp?).

I fall asleep outside with my sunglasses on, and my boss catches me all the damn time.

So, tomorrow I work 9-4, and I should be up and ready to go to work :D

I hope I get a day off this week. Its been awhile since i've been out to hang with my friends."

If only there was a way to carry a little fragment of everything 
that ever touched you
And for each fragment to be big enough to bathe in
when you thirst for the splendid past.

Then goodbye wouldn&#39;t feel like violence 
against love as delicate as a spider&#39;s thread
that binds hopelessly to dying things.

I wish there was a forever place
to store all sources of wonder
of which you are one."

Such is life when you&#39;re used to winning. In a direct and confessional mood, Orietta tells her worldly bed-fellow about her habit of photographing herself constantly every day &quot;to get to know myself&quot;. She asks if he&#39;d like to see some of the photos. He accedes but is then gone before she gets back with her glowing MacBook.

It <i>is</i> ridiculous to get to know yourself through the shallow medium of the selfie. So why have I got this affliction as badly as Orietta?

Getting close to something good and rich and meaningful yet still encumbered with habits of the uninspired.

<![endif]-->  </span><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"">Dear Diary,<br /> <br /> As of 24 hours ago I have been driving myself insane.<br /> <br /> I don't believe in love at first sight. I particularly don't believe in love at first sight when I&nbsp;have deadlines waiting the following day. I tried to calm myself earlier with some lovely codeine but it was much stronger than usual and I&nbsp;have just risen from four hours of lying paralytically still in bed. This has not helped the deadline fear or the romantic insanity.<br /> <br /> You have to understand the context. I do not trust men. This trust has been leaking away quietly and now I am forced to confront a thoroughly empty bucket. The empty bucket I&nbsp;understand. I&nbsp;like men and flirt with them and amuse myself with interactions that are neither here nor there. This is convenient as I have no time or mental space for a romantic escapade right now. I&nbsp;have two deadlines tomorrow, a media law exam in a week then after that a month to complete my final masters project. </span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"">This is not the time to start anything.<br /> <br /> But I&nbsp;must be a fool because I am thinking that a 24-year-old Swedish-Irishman who speaks six languages can offer more than this postgraduate course which cost more effort than anything before and is nearly over.<br /> <br /> I&nbsp;should do the right thing and describe how we met.<br /> <br /> Again the context may have something to do with my current palpitations. I&nbsp;watched two people who were dopey with love get married in a church in York. It wasn't like I&nbsp;was watching the bride thinking &quot;when will it be meeee?&quot; but, discounting the cloying levels of Jesus in the ceremony, I guess it was a beautiful day. However I caught the train back to London before desert so I could attend Phil, the editor of the music paper's birthday.<br /> <br /> This in itself had me in a state of anxious pride. Why the hell would I be invited? Also, what mind-bogglingly stupid thing would I say to poison my future relationship with him and the paper? I&nbsp;had to go. If someone you madly respect who can also help your career invites you to something, you go, even if it means missing chocolate parfait.<br /> <br /> I got the train to Kings X then hopped on a bus to Old St. Sitting on the bus I could feel the boy beside me staring. Eventually, he stuck out a hand so I turned to look at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can I touch your hair?&quot;<br /> <br /> His eyes were wide and blonde hair poked out from under a beanie. There were massive retro-style headphones slung around his neck. I drank him in while saying &quot;uhhhh&quot;. Despite his looks, it would have been my instinct to not engage with a boy who asks to touch my hair on a bus. However, I was in a wide-open mind state from a week of travelling in Germany by myself.<br /> <br /> I let him touch my hair then he said he had only been in London for two weeks and had been travelling for two years round various places in Europe + the North Pole but he hadn't reached N90 so he was going back to do that. He was going to Brick Lane now to meet a friend who was heading off to Thailand the next day. I told him I was going to Dalston for the birthday which was open invitation. He showed enthusiasm so I&nbsp;wrote the address into his phone. He guessed my age which people usually get wrong. I&nbsp;was impressed. Then it was my stop. We parted on a note of maybe-see-you-later.<br /> <br /> I&nbsp;wasn't convinced he would come. Most Londoners would show enthusiasm and then not. But most Londoners wouldn't have approached me like he did.<br /> <br /> I got to the address of the party and waited down a dubious alley for Siobhan. Was too crippled with self-consciousness to go in by myself. She took fifteen minutes then we went in.&nbsp;It was like a sauna. Sweat was dripping down the inside lining of my demure cream dress within minutes. A nice man at the bar bought us drinks then I spotted Luke who works for the music website. Went over and chatted to him. Then Phil came. He seemed genuinely pleased I had come and tore open my card like he was an eleven-year-old boy who knew there was an xbox inside. He gave me a lovely hug then...<br /> <br /> ...fuck me, it's the bus boy with his friend. I was so happy. It was a slightly different vibe from earlier. There had been no touching earlier. This time he hugged me. Everything about him was pumped full of vitality. I could see how fit he was under his shirt&nbsp;and the combination of this with the jungle heat made me feel weak at the knees.<br /> <br /> Everything else was going well from the free drink to the good reception from both Phil and Luke - men I admire professionally and personally to a stupid extent. Bus boy's hand would occasionally graze me accidentally-on-purpose and my every nerve electrified. I&nbsp;like to think I&nbsp;played it pretty cool conversationally. <br /> <br /> Went downstairs to watch a heavy guitar band. Siobhan hated it and seeing as she had been such a good sport about keeping me company I&nbsp;asked if she wanted to head to a warehouse party she had mentioned earlier. Hers was an unequivocally affirmative response. I told the boys and asked if they wanted to come too. Yes.<br /> <br /> Said goodbye to Phil and Luke. Outside the club I&nbsp;decided I should go home to give myself a fighting chance of working the next day. Bus boy tried to persuade me to come with them but my logic was powerful and he conceded. Something about him was so...assured. He made it so clear he liked me. He even said &quot;I&nbsp;really like you&quot;. It felt so good, being in his headlights. I can still feel the small kiss and his powerful arms.<br /> <br /> See, this was a perfectly-contained romantic episode. I am happy with this. I&nbsp;almost wish we hadn't exchanged numbers because it can only go downhill and undermine the gentle enjoyment of our brief time together. I&nbsp;have already imagined the best-case scenario and even that will surely fuck up my masters.<br /> <br /> Oh god.</span></span></p></lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>"

When the evening is spread out against the sky&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Like a patient etherised upon a table;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The muttering retreats&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Streets that follow like a tedious argument&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Of insidious intent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
To lead you to an overwhelming question &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Oh, do not ask, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Let us go and make our visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the room the women come and go&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Talking of Michelangelo"

"event","Oh, the constant agonies of...generally everything. I have to do so much nice stuff&nbsp;to keep the balance even. 

Today, I&nbsp;had oysters for the first time. Public Enemy may&nbsp;say 'don't believe the hype' but actually go ahead and believe it. Oysters are sensual explosions whose aftertatse and effects just keep bouncing around your mouth. Me and Abby bought two Colchesters&nbsp;for &pound;2.80 at a stall on Borough market. A little later we came back and bought&nbsp; two more. The next thing we know we're in Wright Brothers having a lunch of oysters and champagne. The decadence. I'm going back for the Fruits de Mer platter. 

Reading Graham Greene and in agonies over my stupidity and my lover's reserve. At my request, he let me have it with both barrels on Wednesday night and since then&nbsp;I have been in fear of desertion and in awe of the breadth of my attachment to him. When I was single and yearning for a boyfriend, I imagined how we would be joined together in a montage of wholesome fun. I&nbsp;never thought about the arguments, the silences, the insecurity, the crticisms. If someone had told me that there would be so much of this I would have said 'dude, you walk away at that point' but love feels more important than an easy life. Love feels like a medicine that you'd have to be insane to reject even though it sometimes tastes like battery acid."

*don't eat on the underground unless, and perhaps even when, rabid with hunger - the stifling conditions make me want to choke it back up
*build people up always, in print and in life - perhaps with the exception of when dealing with official bodies on the phone 
*don't give money to homeless people until i have cleared my debts with loved ones (got fleeced out of a fiver by a ridiculously charming man at london bridge. muggins)
*i need more than five hours sleep and am lying to myself when i plan to get up after 0.3 seconds and perform 12.5million tasks
*the foal is nice! - i felt mortified when - in the wake of asking him to email me his set list - i acted retarded and he acted moody but he DID email me, and in a pleasant fashion to boot
*like many things, friendliness is about intelligence
*don't mix two stressors - e.g. liam and mother
* when people say negative things about people&nbsp; that i like, instead of clamming up and being neutral, attempt to engulf them with positivism. this is the way to world peace.
*the goal is wit and humour. the goal is ALWAYS wit and humour
* i feel better when i restrain the urge to tell lots of personal stories and instead LISTEN to the personal stories being told
* liam has a bossy streak. when it rears its voluble head do not argue. this will only inflame the bossing
*my next boyfriend will be sociable, financially secure and calm. i'm not falling in love with any more losers.
*i'm starting to get why people value 'niceness'. irresponsible people are rapidly losing their charm. once you start to believe in social good, rogues taken on the appearance of spoilsports. OH FUCK, i am heading to the establishment, i have a convert's zeal for it
*erotic review is a haven.
*do not facebook stalk my friends (even if i do think they are totally beautiful). it makes me feel awkward when i see them which is not remotely helpful."

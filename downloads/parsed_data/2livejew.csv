"event","This Friday is my twin sister's wedding. She's having it in Boston. This should be a very interesting day for me.  My father will be there, along with his whore of a wife. Both I haven't seen or spoken to in about 6 years. There's still a lot of animosity between us.

I just think the whole wedding is a big joke, and I'm not the only one.

At least it's open bar all night."

"event","Well, I've been struck twice. After I finished my overnight 12 hour shift, I went to go get my slashed tire replaced. I arrived to my apt, to find the front door unlocked. As I enter MY domain, I notice that two laptops are missing (mine, and Chucky's). Both which were gifts from my mother. I notice my closet light on, which I never leave on. I look over to my stereo unit, and notice that my Dell Digital Jukebox is missing, which again was a gift from my mother. I spoke to Chuck, and he wasn't home at all. I also noticed that Chucks camcorder was missing as well. 

So, we were officially robbed. I called the fuzz, made a report. Called my insurance company, thank god I had renters insurance!! (Thanks mom for bugging me to get it). So, my week has pretty much SUCKED!!!

I have my camping trip next weekend, and I just hope against hope, that is doesn't rain on my parade! FUCK I NEED A VACATION!!! 

So, I won't be able to access my myspace, LJ or AOL for awhile. So, if you need to get ahold of me. Please call my cell. 603-547-5170. DAMN YOU LIFE! DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!"

"event","Camping trip June 16th. So far the list includes, Myself,Chucky Ballz,The Bishop Don The Magic Juan, Big Poppa John, Bryan Dean, hopefully Joey Cogs, and Bob Knob. I'm sure the list will grow. 

The camping trip will be at Lafayette Campgound, in Franconia Notch,NH. It's a beautiful place, and I reserved two sweet sites. Both are by the river. This will be a big bro-fest, I wonder how long everyone will last without their cell phones? Mead,Brendan and Josh, if you read this you're more than welcome to come along. Actually, I hope you do!"

And I was so excited about getting the slippers, that I couldn't wait to go home and ""slip"" them on. Does that make me boring, or easy to please? Or both? The slippers are totally sweet though. Finshed up my night with chinese food, and chocolate ice cream for dessert. Along with some Spike tv. MXC rocks!

The people are cool, and it's in Nashua..which rocks! I also got a new apt in Nashua, with Chuck.  I always wanted to get a place with him, and it finally happened. So, we're a happy couple in our new pad.
The place ain't fancy. But it's my first place..so I'm stoked.
I've been going to a lot of great shows lately. Locobazoka was a blast. 
We went crazy on the nu-metal kids. I have a lot of great pics from the show. I'm going to be heading down to W. Mass for a show at Fat Cabot. Should be a blast. That's really pretty much it. I've been wicked busy with the new job, bar gig, and new apt crap. But all is good and I'm happy, and that works for me.


Long distance marriage? WTF does that mean?? Funniest thing I've read in a while.

Speaking of marriages, where the hell are the pics from Meads' wedding???"

"event","<P>So..I went skydiving on Tuesday. It was amazing! But, I wasn't nervous or scared at all. I think it's due to the fact, that I had another person strapped onto my back. That way, if I go down..I'm taking that person with me.&nbsp; I have the whole thing video taped, I'm sure the video will be quite amusing.&nbsp; Tuesday was my little sister's 21st birthday, and that's the reason for the whole skydiving ordeal. My sister had an awesome birthday. She had about 10 friends who went skydiving with her. She's turned into quite a amazing woman. It makes me feel old, to see how mature she's gotten. I remember changing her shitty diapers.&nbsp; </P>
<P>No stupid drunkeness this week, these younging's don't know the first thing about boozing. It was getting boring sitting in the hotel room drinking, with everyone watching me. These kids get a little buzz on, and the next thing they pass out. What ever happend to dedication!?</P>
<P>I got some cool pics from this week, I'd put them up here..but I have no idea on how to do it. Someone school me!</P>
<P>Big props to Joey, for hanging with me on Tuesday. I know it was a bit out of his element, but he pulled it off nicely. It was great to have someone with me, who I can relate to and talk to.&nbsp; And a big thanks for blowing up all those ballons Joey..I love ya!!! Well..that's about it for now. If anyone is in the Manchester area..and wants to keep me company while I'm bartending..then come on in. </P>


Missing her greatly."

I'm sick of looking for something but finding nothing. The only thing I've ever been is honest and sincere, but all it gives me is regret and depression. I'm fine with being used as a sexual void, just don't bother with the pillow talk and no one will get hurt."

"event","So, lastnight I was a bit bored. I decided to go for a few beers at the Uptown Tavern. Some doods know about this place, we had some heavy metal rocking good times there. 

I'm at the bar, enjoying my Miller Lite. Which was going down rather easily, I might say. About 30 minutes later, this girl creeps up next to me, and bluntly tells me that I look ""so loooooooonely"". Because I wasn't sitting or speaking with anyone. I was however reading the paper, enjoying the music and relaxing. So I guess that means a person is lonely, if they're reading. Well..she starts babbling like a brook, about some crap that I don't care about. Then she asks me if I would like to go back to her table. I respectfully declined, and told her that I was just relaxing and reading the paper. Well..I guess that wasn't a valid answer, for she begged me 3 more times. But I still held fast and told her that I might in a few. She left, and went back into her corner to get ready for round two. About 15-20 minutes later she came back, surprised that I haven't joined her and her friends at their table. I again told her that I am still reading the articles and that I might..MIGHT have you...join them in a few. Still that my reply had no affect, for she wouldn't leave my side. Now she wanted to know what was so interesting in the paper. I came up with some lame ass articles, that were in the local city paper. Update soon.."

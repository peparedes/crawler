"event","yay a new thingy. i love this things but im always too lazy to write haha.


so yeah, today should be a fun day...im hangin out with melissa for most of the day. whoopers.

lately i've figured out some stuff. i really didnt know how hard it was to deal with some stuff in your life but now i'm past that. i've figured out that you dont always need someone to be happy. im perfectly happy without someone, because you have your friends there for you. id take 10 best friends over 1 person to love any day. you can always gain love but friendships are hard to regain...i learned that you dont want to EVER drop a friend for someone also. that can ruin mostly everything in your life. its like that one person is controling you and you have no way to get out...its not fair to the friends you have to just kinda drop them to be with someone that might not be around for very long.
my friends inspired me to really step back and think about all this stuff. why bother if it wont work anyways right? sometimes you just need a friend...when people say they need someone to love, they really need someone to be there for them...which is a friend.

i cant even explain what im feeling right now. im all the emotions combined. its never really one emotion for me. and i cant explain it but i know that im gonna be okay and that i just have to deal with all the nonsense in my life. everyone around me has lived through it, so can i.


sometimes i really dont think i know what im talking about. but honestly, right now, i really know. i know how it feels to just be dumped and left to the side hanging while they go off with someone else. i know how it feels to be ditched. i know how it feels to be wanted to be hung out with. i know how it feels to ditch someone. i know the aftermath of everything happening in my life will be good. i know everythings going to be alright, i just doint know when."

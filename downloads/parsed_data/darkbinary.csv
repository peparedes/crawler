"event","Wow~ haven't updated in a while, I am acutally really tired, its like 3 in the morning but here I am :P
I guess I didn't talk to my friend on the phone tonight and it seem like I am missing something before I sleep.

WelL~ I don't know if everyone who reads my LJ know that I don't celebrate ""Christmas"" but well..I don't :P Yea I know, its seems weird that a christian doesn't celebrate Christmas. There is a fairly detailed explantion but to sum it up its basically..
1) Christ was not born on December 25th (There are no way shepards are tending their sheep in the fields in december O.o)
2) The bible only recorded two birthday celebration ever and both were ""bad"" accounts such as the beheading of John the Baptist
3) December 25th used to be a day of celebration of the birth of ""sun god"" but gradually changed over to what it has become today...
4) Most things about christmas are not from the bible, for example, Santa, Mistltoe, Christmas Tree, Gift exchange.
5) As a christian, I celebrate Christ birth 365 days ^^ more importantly, I celebrate that he died for my sins and that he have risen again and is living right now! 

I am not here to say that others who celebrate Christmas are WRONG^^;; Its just looking into the origin of Christmas have shown me how the core message of Christmas is not even Christ himself and have never been. Its like forcing Christ to be part of something that was never a celebration of him in the first place~

But during this time of year, I do take the time out to reflect on everything God have given me since it IS new years ^^ So with that said~ Happy New Years to everyone :P God have given me so much blessings over the last year that listing them would take too long and just time wasted^^;; Blessings such as brothers and sisters at church, family, new friends at school, old friends from school :P, and someone there for me when I need the most and also Christ there for me when I need the most ^^

So far I have failed one course and passed everything else so far which is 4 Pass and 1 Fail out of 7 courses. Hopefully I will get the rest of my marks soon ^^

I have some other stuff to update..loooots have been happeening but I guess its time to sleep so until next time :P"

"event","wow I ""DO"" have a balanced life o.o

according to that, I view fun and career as the same value...so I probably will try to look for a job that I can have fun in at the same time. I noticed that Love is very close too...thats probably because...how do you have love wiht out having fun ^^~ I mean when I am with the one I love~ it will definitly be fun :D Then its my health..yea..I guess I don't look at my health as that important...then its money and family...I think this chart reflects like..immediate family, like my mom and my dad, not my future wife cause I would consider her as ""love""~ ^^......and well..everyone knows my life does not revolve around money :P

Back to studying for my last exam!! ^^

i am so happy that I passed 263 ^_________________________________________^"

Started studying for EECE 251 today..I am totally going to fail..I have no idea whats going on and I got tomorrow to finish studying for it...The library renovations are weird...its looking nicer..but then since I've been at that library since grade 5..it feels like they are putting new wallpaper on..it doesn't really feel like they made the library any better (probably also because Koerena (sp?) and David Lam owns XD

Anyways~ I couldn't go to fellowshpi today so thank you Gary for taking over singsparation for me ^^ Or else I would have had to go which would have cut my studying time -.-;; I have very limited time...I am not going to make it..I know I am going to fail something...maybe I sohuld just decide what to fail =P anyways~ alrite, back to showing my cousin Black Cat, they just finished FMA like a month ago (I see them once or twice a month and they only get to watch it here)

<lj-cut text=""Cutttt :P"">
You've been tagged! 

    * You must now follow the rules and list eight things your lover <33 must have..
      in addition:
      you must tag 8 other people and tell them in your blog + prop them
    * if tagged twice, you'll only have to do this once (=

My <333...

**Since I am a guy, these are going to be super short with no explinations whatsoever >D
1. She must be a christian ^^~ Just that I really believe a relationship needs a foundation where both person is going towards the same goal. And as christians, our goal is always to glorify God ~ I mean its going to be hard to help each other and carries each other's burden if we arn't even moving in the same direction

2. Willing to communicate ~^^ Unfortunately for the ladies who are reading this, we caaan't read ur minds XD Buuttt with that said, I wouldn't expect her to have to tell me every little thing. I mean, as her boyfriend, I should be able to read her mind :P But if I notice something is wrong...she wouldn't go ""you should know what is wrong /an""...:P

3. Smart (Common Sense^^), but also rely on me for certain things cause I ""am"" the guy ^.~
4. Pretttty ^^...okay I am not ""that"" shallow but ...glasses, medium length hair... muahhaah >D
5. I don't know anymore...
6. This is hard....
7. Especially that...
8. I haven't really ever thought of..""requirments"" ^^;;

She would just be perfect~..for me ^^

Anyways~ I have to tag 8 people..obvious this was stolen from xanga..so I can't prop people...

the only people who check this would be Theresa XD....and maybe Jingie~...and Joanas? O.o And since I got this from helen shes already done it...ssooo

*TAGS* -> Theresa, Jingie, Joanas :D

"event","wow its been so long since I updated this journal, countless people have already nagged me to update ^^;; And I guess eventually one of them got to me :P Well...my...last..entry...is all the way back to when I can't even remember ^^;; lots happened through this past year so I am not going to try and recap everything.

2nd Year EE + Work is very tiring, that sums up my last four months in terms of school. But then I have a good balance in my own personal life so its okay ^^ I am still surviving :P

<lj-cut text=""Church construction :P"">Church construction is near completion, I am so excited for it ^^ It looks awesome, I can't wait to acutalyl move in but I heard the rooms are going to be smaller then expected and acutally smaller then some of the rooms we are currently using. Which in my opinion, makes sense -.-;; cause my current fellowship is renting out STM right now and there is no way we can get as big of a room for us. 
Here is a picture from its construction :P I probably won't be the first one to walk down the aisle there~ but I would love to one day ^^..(wow that totally made me sound like a chick XD)

My Exam schedules are as follows
Dec 7,8,9,13,,15,16 at 8:30 AM
Dec 7 4:00 - 5:30pm

In the Order of Math 265, EECE 251(FAILAGE -.-), Math 263(FAILAGE -.-), CPSC 260(Fail?), APSC 201, EECE 256(...I don't know...). The other Dec7th one is EECE 280...its a weird course, I may do fine, I may completely die. As you see, I have 3 exams in two days on the 7th and the8th...but unfortunately, UBC policy says that we can only defer an exam if 3 is schedules to be ""COMPLETED"" within 24 hours...and the current schedule is that the exams will be completely within..26 hours ...=.=;; Gotta start studying ^^;; Probably going to study in this order, 251, 263, 265, 260, 256,...

I think I work too much so I am going to start cutting back a while, I quit maximum tune though so I don't need as much money anymore ^^ I saved so much money~ I took out a hundred dollars this week from the bank..and its thursday..and I still have 100 dollars !!! :D I am so glad I was able to cut back since I have better things to save the money towards and people that I would rather spend the time with ^^

Anyways~Went to UBC on monday, that was fun. Pretty much it was just a ""get-ubc-id"" day, but it gradually became wander around UBC and richmond day. Went to UBC in the morning to get my Upass and ID card so I can start busing for ""free"". After getting the ID...oh wait...I went with Theresa, anyways After getting the ID, me and her wandered around the campus just kinda looking around. I can't remember the order of things. I wanted to stock a tour group and follow them XD that didn't work out very well. Visited the Music Building, the Student Union Building, and then..found out what Chan Center looked like *sweatdrop*...yes I did not know it was a big cillinder shape~ like I said to Theresa, they should make chan center garbage can suveneir. Anyways~ So after that,&nbsp; I wanted to check out the library. We went to the main library first thinking it was.....well..the main library...I was wrong....it was the maze of books XD It was a relatively old building, it looks beautiful, it felt more like an archive filled with records and old maps. Right across from it is the new building. Looked around there for a while and was amazed at the volume of books and also found where I will spending lots of my free time...the Computer Lab >D We also saw the 99 chairs and I thought it would be funny to bring in another chair just to screw them up XD Anyways after that we decided we were bored .....so we wanted to go bak to Richmond for lunch...perfect...lets put our new bus pass to use~ Saw a 99 and wanted to get on...except the bus driver shut the doors...when we wanted to get on so it was like O.o Then we went over to the 41 and took that......long story there that no one needs to know.....except...I was stupid and made us wait longer ^^;; Anyways transfered to the 98 at Granville and saw Cynthia on a bus going the othre way O.o...o.O...Then came back to Richmond and got off at Aberdeen, had some lunch~ went to Frabrica..(sp?) XD I dont' go there obviously.....I was accompanying her. Anyways after that, she went wiht me to future shop and radioshack where I spent like 30 min looking for a stupid radio. it was pretty much like, I went with her to buy frabric, she come wiht me to electronics. Then we went home~ That was the end of that day in a nutshell~ it was fun never the less and i took out lots of litle details.

Updates for today~ Relatives left today~&nbsp; I couldn't be with them for departure since it is my 1st day working. Learned so much things, about Domains and networking. The job duties are pretty much, format and update computers for 15/hr. Pwn! So thats great~ did a laptop today, almost finished a desktop and started on another one before I left. I get a little door scanner card and keys and everything. Information System Specialist~ even the title sounds cool XD Good company, very easy going environment. I go to work at 8:00 and get home at around 5:30 ish~ the hours are very loose, its pretty much on a when you want to be here basis. Anyways~ thats my little update^^

My relatives are over from HK, they went to toronto for the past 2 weeks I believe and got to vancouver 2 days ago. I havn't seen them for 10 years and those that know my memory knows that 10 years is waayy too long. Its my uncle from my father's side and they brought along 2 sons, one that is 12 and another that is 6. They can be really annoying but they are my brothers since its from my father's side so as annoying as they can be, I found myself to have an overwhelming amount of patience, probably from God XDD Anyways~ I am not going to share much about summer camp here, only that it really revived my spiritual life and restructured my praying attitude. Yesterday was north vancouver / standley(never got there cause it rained) day, today was whistler. Whistler brought back so much memories from 2 years ago when a whole bunch of us from Senior band went to the band trip.Walking around the place, seeing the hotel we stayed in, the starbucks that became our hangout place bceause there is pretty much nothing u can do at whistler, the earls that was uber expensive, and the subway that was used as our source of food. So much memories, I miss band. Anyways~ enough about that, they are here for 2 weeks, so I declined my job offer and focus on being their tour guide for 2 weeks. Its going to be fun cause I think they are going to go on tours around Vancouver and they are going to drag me along...-.-;; 

Alrite, I am super tired and want to sleep but then.....Naruto first XD

Lets start with grad dinner dance~ That was an awesome eventXD too much fast songs for my liking, it got redundant towards the end ^^;; but it was fun never the less. I had a great time, regret that I didn't go in a limo, cause honestly speaking I hardly doubt that will ever happen XD </FONT>

The desert was good ^^...mmmm ....food...XD we went to bubble tea after, I didn't put those pictures on cause well..I am lazy but lets just say~ that was an awesome nite, the girls looked gorgeous and the guys looked smart~

hmm...then came valedictory....wow.....I have to say, it feels completely different when you are part of the group that is graduating. I have been to 3 valedictories, and most of them were pretty boring, but when u are the one that is standing up there receiving your certificate....it feels completely different~^^

Alrite...I just went through all the pictures again writing down what I want to put on and oh my goodness there are a lot of pictures. Like 10 Plus x.x

to a man, he will get bored with you
i don't think this is wrong
a girl says that she will never be fooled again
but she will fall in love again

Hey babe
the pain
it's not enough to describe how i feel
we were so happy together
but I know now
I've been blind
you told me that you'd never let me down
whenever I needed you you'd always be here
I can forgive but I cant forget
even though you hurt me
I still love you
I still love you

School started I guess, it still hasn't really settle in that I am grade 12. I guess nothing really settled in yet. All this moving and everything. Although I say nothing have been happening, I guess in a weird way, so many things are happening around me. Everyone feel that much further away now that I moved, not just location wise, I just feel like I don't belong. Anyways, I should transfer my english block and get a spare in B, that would really free up my schedule, I hope I didn't make a wrong decision to stay in Mr.May's class, I've always liked him more then Mrs. Bentley and besides, I like the class mate in my B blk english. As for all the other blocks, everything is as I thought it would be. Nothing is a surprise, nothing is out of the ordinary, everything is exactly how I expected it to be...its not good, or bad, its just....there....like I am...just there..."

After watching TV late at nite yesterday, I walked in my room at about 1 o'clock ready to sleep. And I walked into the room and the room was kinda brighter then usual. I was wondering where the light was coming from since I almost never turn on the light in my room. I looked out the window and there it was, the brightest moon I've seen in a very long time. I went on my bed and just looked at the moon for the longest time. I don't know why...I just can't help to think that at the same time...other people are looking at it  too..and for some weird reason, that made me feel less lonely. Anyways, I stared at the moon for I don't even know how long...then I woke up this morning. I've never been one to remember my dreams, I guess it has its good side and bad side. I wonder what dreams I had yesterday nite..I will never know~ 

Anyways~^^ Provincials and Piano exam....lol.....watch me fail both.

the camp kinda sucked, did like nothing except play cheat, big2 and travel scrabble.
Kinda wasn't really up to doing anything either. Anyways, its been a long 2 weeks for me, but I think I made the right chose. If it was really a chose for me to make. It just kinda fell apart, everything just kinda happened and I wonder it was my fault.I kinda saw it coming and I kinda pushed it more, some what on purpose...why? I have no idea. I mean she was willing to try, but I couldn't live with myself, the distance and everything, I just can't do it. I guess thats just who I am as a person, I kinda need security in my relationships. I miss her a lot though, at least knowing that I miss her, kinda tells me that what I felt for her is real, and wasn't just me lying to myself about my feelings. Anyways, summer school starts tomorrow and I guess its kinda good..fresh start with summer. .....I need something to do to keep my mind off >.>;;

Report came on thursday, nothing really shocked me, nothing really made me proud. I mean its gr.11 .....its like...eh~...whats new?...XD Summer school is coming soon like next wednesday~ And I have camping on sunday to tuesday (I think I forgot to tell you Tea or Jay O.o) Which is going to be fun, I don't know. Today we went BBQing, it was acutally quite fun, talked a bit and played around a bit. Although I keep saying that it can be organized better, I think it was great. Everyone had fun, I guess I am always the person who is picky about stuff like that. Angela brought like some magic lighter thing that isn't really coal, a lot of last minute stuff but its all good. We ate everything, had lots of fun, took tons of pictures. And it got me out of the house with some friends and also away from AIM and RO. RO have been increasingly boring lately, the new guild helped for a while but I think I just won't be playing that much. Mia is like lvl 87 -.- and Jess is a good 81. Shaw is kinda making me play less which is acutally good imo. Leveling my wizard is incrediblely slow. I don't think I am going to quit, but I am definitly playing less, unconsciensely(sp?) I was going to hunt for a 4lc but then shaw pissed me off so I didn't bother, I don't mind as long as I don't get disconnected every 3 min -.- Anyways, yea probably going to play less. Maybe hang out with friends some more, watever, call some ppl up. Thinking back to BBQ, yea, I really enjoyed it. Saw some old friends like Angel, and it was just good, to get away from ppl from RO and get away from her for a while. Just need to sort out myself, and where I am. It was nice to get it all out and acutally hear myself say it. (thanks~). I havn't talked with her like that in a very long time, it was nice~ And maybe next time I can the listener =D I missed fellowship today, I wonder what I missed. I hope I can acutally get my friends to actually come to church once. Just to see what I believe in, because Christ has really been important in my life. Its kinda whats keeping my family together, its what I rely on, and when people compliment me on whatever, I just think that its God's glory that I am able to have believed so young, and to have the bible as my moral standard. I am not the best witness for Christ cause I swear excessively...I really need to work on that extremely. Anyways, its now 3:45 am. I should sleep although I am not really sleepy, don't know why. Maybe wake up early tomorrow and go  online or something, or find someone to chat to. My room is actually clean O.o Neways, *looks up*..whoa~......drop me a comment for whoever reads it, even a hi would be lovely ^^"

School is kinda picking up nicely, the mandarin play although I have issues with the other so called director, as long as other people acknowledge that the play is mine, I am not about to start a conflict, I care less if he gets full marks, as long as the play comes up well ^^ Physics is fun~! Theresa probably would insert her sarcasm here going ""riiite"".....Relativity is fun though, I acutally get some of the theory and how stuff work, I am still a little stuck on the concept the light speed is the only constant and everything else its relative. Honestly, relativity is only a concept, unless we travel at anywhere close to 50% of light speed, we won't even notice a difference. Chemistry is pretty striaght forward, tutoring vicky is pretty easy, she seems to get most of the concepts and how to write the chemical symbols. Robotics is kinda pissing me off though -.-;; I found out ""one"" of the problems today, apparently my pic chip when I reprogram it didn't delete the ""wiggle"" program, thats why it was acting all weird and I had to buy a new chip .....-.-;; English....havn't done anything, I am going to die. Math is normal as always, CAPP is just CAPP, we are starting on ethics and morals, interesting topic really, and class discussion is pretty good. Accounting, w00t~! I just got perfect on the last inclass so happy....test tmr....-.-

......weird how I like to go through all my classes and tell how they are all going. Probably because I never update.....soem much stuff I have to do in the coming weeks, mandarin play for one, robotics competition, robotics kiosk display, english big big test, accounting final coming up.....blah~!

I don't wanna do anything anymore. Its like I losted something, that it isn't there anymore. RO, which used to be my escape, have now become another place where I've losted my purpose, my direction. People around me are getting hurt too, I've become some what cold hearted, neglectful(if that is a word), and inconsiderate. All I want is to get away from people now. Everything I put my time in have changed, in the exact same time last month, I would have said everything was going great. But now, the guild is unstable, and breaking, My wizard have been messed up again because of the useless area spells. My goal of having a strong guild have disappeared and it just doesn't seem plausible. They need a better leader, I am doing a horrible job as of now. Typical, when you think everything is going well. It never is. I probably won't post for a while cause I have no idea what to put here anymore, at least not in the public section.

Its interesting, I was talking to William about this when we were walking home too. But then I proably shouldn't write it here...^-~ RO registration is ending in a few days or somethign? I dunno. I better check, I can't get in touch with Andrew lately and I've been calling him trying to get Theresa's old credit card number so at lesat if I can get one for her, she can re-register. *holds up fist* stupid gravity and thier no debit card policy. I am still thinking about giving her my Credit card, at least this way one of us gets to play. And I think she would want to play IRO more then I do. As much as I like to play RO. If I go over to CRO alone, I proabbly won't go on, maybe this is the end for me in terms of RO. I have 3 more days to find myself 2 credit cards. 

Cource Planning was today. Whoo~!..*sweatdrop* I am planning to drop mandarin and Account gvien the fact that both are realyl useless. 

For Sure Course:
Chemistry 12
English 12 ( No Theresa, I am not taking AP...=P)
Physics 12
Math 12
Calculus 12
Infotech 12A(Summer)

Thinking about:
Prep Business - Data management
Data Management course..>.>;;
AP Phycology 12
Spare Block of cources.

I wanna take chemistry in the summer seeing as the protential Grade 12 chemsitry teacher is horrid.....from previous yearrs, he was known as someone who teaches way too much material that will not be covered. Never the less, I will have to see, as for Infotech 12, I knida need that cources for applying to SFU, if I can, I will apply to SFU and UBC, and if SFU does take me in their stupidly high 90-95% .....that would be good. I was planning to go to UBC with all my friends and what not, but I am havn't second thoughs about priorities between school and freinds. Oh well. Lets hope I can focus on school a little bit more.

I kinda thought it was just the cold air in my lungs, that I would want to throw up. But for the last few days. I have been throwing up rite after I eat, or a little later after I eat. Today, I threw up at lunch, and I didn't even eat...this yellow looking liquid came out that tasted...I have no idea how to describe it. I feel sick, I should take my friends advice and go see a doctor. But all he is going to say again is how I am being affected mentally and there is not physical problem..>.>;;
I hope I get better soon, I just have to....there are people who are worried about me."

"event","Well, lets retype everything I wrote, since stupid computer just crashed. Okay....I was talking baout....o rite. First weke of Christmas holidays is over. I guess everything went well the first week, all the ""parties"" and ""outtings"" were great, I had fun and everything was fine. =P I guess everything was fine until yesterday -.- WARNING, RANT -> I guess everything started yesterday, when I was arguing with parents again. On the fact thatthey want to delay my learners test again. They have already delayed it like for 4 months and they wanan wait until min Jan again~!...we argued about how they promised, and now they wana go bak on it. One thing led to another and they were on the subject of my grades, my lack of practicing piano and also the continous hours infront of the ocmputer. My mom was nagging and I was yelling with her so much. We were obviously both wrong, i have been spendign too much time on the ocmputer but she have delayed my Leanrer's test for 4 months. THen I literally shut them out of my basement and tried to go on RO. The server rejected me like 6 times in a roll, tat added to my anger>.>;;. Then it really went off, I went on RO and I guess I didn't nkow the guild server wasn't working properly, that people couldn't see that I logged on. I thought everyone ignored me and I was literally spazzed out at everyone. I was selffish, selfcentered, and completely mean. I yelled at who I've considered as my friends, and my close ones. I completely flipped out. I hurt my friends and I hurt someone that I really cared about. I felt so bad afterward, that I was reluctant to go on RO again. I could have handled it better, I should have handled it better, but I didn't. Instead I went and released my anger on everyone, on those who I care about. They obviously cared about me but I shut them out. I was mean, and I was.....horrible. The worst thing is that I completely shuted out a close friend, someone who I wanted always to ask if something was wrong, and when they did, all I said was it doesn't concern you. Why did I say that?...It was completely not wat I meant, it wasn't even remotly close to wat I meant. Whatever happened was no excuse to what I have done, no excuse to my inability to control my anger. I would do anything to make them forgive me, to let them understand its one of my weakness and something I am working on, that they won't expcet tat again from me. But I have worn out my promises, I can't blame them if they chose not to forgive me. Well, heres wat happened and its still something tatz on my mind. I dont' want to hurt my friends, I don't wanna do anything like tat. I have to control my anger, even if something is really troubleing, I have to understand, my friends are not there to be used as punch bags, but there to understand and comfort me. T.T    I hope they forgive me

Apart from that..I dont' wanna type anymore. But yea, tatz watz been happening. I needed to get it out. Its been driving me crazy."

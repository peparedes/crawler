"event","Hokay, so the movie has been out for quite some time now. Yes, I know, I've been dragging ass. Where to begin? I guess I'll go with the hollywood aspect. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. That was a brilliant casting decision. Considering that it was almost our good buddy Nic Cage, I'd say we lucked out. <br />This movie had so much to be happy about if you read any of the comics. Sure, they picked a lesser known villain for the movie, but in all honesty Iron Man never had any really believable enemies. At least, not in a movie sense. Most of the bad guys in the comic required entirely too much suspension of belief to put them on the big screen. Iron Monger fit pretty well. As a side note, JEFF BRIDGES!? WTF MATE!? 'THE DUDE' WAS SUCKED UP BY CORPORATE AMERICA MAN! <br />The only issue I really had with the movie was the weird retcon of his creation. I can understand why it was done....but it just wasn't the origin I'm familiar with. In the original story, Stark served in Vietnam. This was later retconned to the GulfWar to try to keep the character from becoming too dated. The movie version did its own thing, but still very well done. <br /><br />Now it's time for cool comic book moments that they included in the movie. S'a long list! <br /><br /><ul><li><div>I have to get this out of the way fist....Stan Lee's cameo as Hugh Hefner. Holy crap, that was hilarious. </div><br /><br /></li><li><div>The moment where Jim Rhodes looks at the other suit and acknowledges he REALLY wants to wear it! In the comic books, Rhodes is War Machine and has his own armor. <br /><br /></div></li><li><div>This one I BARELY caught, but I'm oh so glad I did. In the scene where Pepper catches Stark changing out of the armor, on the work bench you can see he's been working on Captain America's shield. Go back and look, I'm not making it up! <br /><br /></div></li><li><div>They kept Jarvis! Only....they killed him. Apparently they wanted to stray from the whole 'Alfred' stigma so they made him a computer. Eh....I guess it worked. <br /><br /></div></li><li><div>The theme song was all over the place. Of course, this isn't a comic book thing.... but still, it made me very, very happy. <br /><br /></div></li><li><div>S.H.I.E.L.D. People, you have no idea how crazy and convoluted the story arcs get when both Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. are main focus points. <br /><br /></div></li><li><div>The name of the extremist group that holds him hostage is an homage to Mandarin. Wicked. <br /></div></li></ul><br />&nbsp;"

"event","For the sake of time this entry will be in a cut.  I'm going to do my best to give you guys as much information on the subject as I can, as well as my motives.  

I was trying to think of a way to tell people, and after trying to call the guys and getting voicemails, I decided to just wait a bit longer.  Well shortly after that I got a few screaming phones in a panic, I figure since the cat seems to be out of the bag I'll just set the record straight.  

So here it is.   

I'm <lj-cut text=""enlisting"">
This whole thing started with my last trip to the Keys.  I spent some quality time with my godparents and their friends.  My godfather Jack is a retired Air Force pilot, and his friend Don is a retired Navy pilot. They both understand that my dream is to be a pilot, and I don't really care how I get there.  Well, up until then, I had only really understood the Air Force path.  I knew what it would take to make it as an officer, and the hoops I'd have to jump through in order to make it.  It was going to be tough, but I knew I could do it.  

Well, Don enlightened me to a Navy program designed specifically for people like me.  Enlist as an E1 then immediately enter flight training.  If you wash out, you're a fucking Cadet, and it's tough luck for you.  If you make it, upon completion of your training, you're issued a BS from a university in connection with the Navy for Aviation Science, and you become a Commissioned Officer.  Only requirement is a 2 year degree.  Of course, this sounded like the best thing I'd ever heard of, so I did everything I could to learn more about it.  

After searching everything I could find on the internet, and couldn't find a damn thing on the program.  So I contacted the Navy directly, informed them of my intentions, and asked them to send me a packet with the information I needed via Navy.com.  Two days later, there was a knock at my door and I met Petty Officer 1st Class,(PO1) Barker.  He informed me that the program was perfect for people like me, but that it no longer exists.  Last year they had 200 applicants, and only 32 are now flying.  This caused the Navy to dismantle the program.  

I thought about showing the guy the door right there, but since I had only really concentrated on the Air Force, I didn't know anything about the Navy and I figured this guy could give me some answers.  Now before you say it, I KNOW!  He's a recruiter.  His job is to tell me what I want to hear, and get me to sign.  

With all of the information I gathered from both PO1 Barker and his CO Cabral, I now know that the Navy route would supply me with FAR less hoops to jump through in order to fill a pilot spot.  Now, I made a mistake on my part.  I <i>told</i> them I was interested.  They of course tried to get me to sign ASAP and threw every recruiting tactic they had at me.  PO1 Barker eventually gave up and realized I was going to be a nightmare for him.  His CO, however, decided to play hardball.  I didn't bite for any of his enlistment ploys, so I told him I'd see him in two weeks and we'd go from there.  That's when I was labeled high asset/high risk.  I took their practice ASVAB and blew it out of the water.  This meant that as an enlisted sailor, I'd most likely take a very technical field and later get picked up for officer training.  This would make the eval of the office go up.  Well, after I received such a label, I got a call from Chief Pullen.  Apparently Cabral didn't know what to do, so he called a Chief Petty Officer to intervene.  

With the information I was able to gather from the two Chiefs I was now dealing with, it was a lot easier to come up with a decision.  Chief Pullen and Chief Krevda are not recruiters.  The information I was given was not candy coated, and was very straightforward.  

It breaks down like this guys. If I finished my 4 year degree and tried to enlist as an Officer, I'd most likely get accepted, but it would be pretty difficult to get picked up for a pilot spot.  As a civilian, I'd be about average as far as applications go.  Now, if I joined as an E3 with my AA from BCC, and did well on the ASVAB I'd get to pick from a long list of technical careers.  Careers that if things did go 'worst case scenario' and I didn't get picked up for Officer Training School, I'd still be very, VERY happy with.  But if I enlisted and took a good technical career, I'd most likely get accepted for OTS upon arrival at my first duty post.  It's sad to say, but it's true in all branches of the military.  ONLY. OFFICERS. FLY.  
Because of that, I have to take the best path that will make me look like a great candidate for OTS.  Being a diamond in the rough on the E side of the fence benefits me more than being an average civilian that wants to climb inside a billion dollar jet.  

I'll be entered to the DEP program.  My ship date will be sometime in January after my graduation from BCC.  This is only if the few remaining variables do not change.  The first one being BCC's class schedule.  If they do not offer the classes I need to take in order to graduate, I'm going to have to delay the enlistment.  If I don't pass the CLAST, I'll have to delay enlistment, AND fucking kill myself.  Seriously, that test is easy, but it's something I have to take into account.  
There is also the chance that I go to Jacksonville, get my career list, and they say 'oh no, we dont have a spot for you in that training session, now youre going to be a chef on a submarine'.  If this happens, I can still walk out and will do so.  





</lj-cut>

I did my best to explain my thought process and my course of action.  You can agree with my decision and support it, or you can disagree and respect it.  Either way, this is what's happening."

"event","<p>&nbsp;It's almost 4 in the morning and I'm not even remotely tired.&nbsp; I tried to sleep in today, but that apparently wasn't in the cards.&nbsp; The pugs decided they didn't want to wait for breakfast, and Boomer decided he didn't want to be the only one sleeping on the floor.&nbsp; Oye. <br /><br />Today was rather uneventful.&nbsp; Did a whole bunch of nothing then had the ritualistic pizza&amp;wings at P and Pangie's.&nbsp; After hours of shenanigans and tomfoolery, I made the trek back to bumfuck nowhere Malabar.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I'm the only one awake this side of 192 and I'm kinda losing it.&nbsp; I should have at least brought my sketchpad or something.&nbsp; This fucking sucks.&nbsp; I do have a PS3 here, but I've already run through Call of Duty 4 about a million times.&nbsp; It's the only thing I played when I was in Orlando for a week while at Pinky Manor.&nbsp; Ha, I don't even know if they're still calling it that, but I'll just go with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />So far, the only way I've been able to entertain myself is to throw things down the hallway and watch the cat go apeshit chasing it.&nbsp; I have no idea what the HELL is wrong with this ball of fluff, but she thinks everything is a toy, and must be attacked.&nbsp; I think even Boomer gets attacked occasionally, he always seems to give the damn cat some extra room whenever it comes by.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />At this point I understand that I'm </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Edit:&nbsp;<br /></strong>Ok I realize that this entry kinda trailed off there, but it was a late night for me, and then something ran through the yard and was attacked my a bigger something.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; I saw something kinda meander across the yard and I watched it for a bit and got bored.&nbsp; I came back here, and started writing again.&nbsp; After a few more lines I heard this god awful yowl or yelp and some really deep growls.&nbsp; I fuckin' SPAZZED.&nbsp; I'm watching 2 pugs and a golden retriever and all of them were inside.&nbsp; So I jumped up to see what the HELL was going on out there, and this black shadowy thing was on top of what I guessed was bobcat and was kicking its ass.&nbsp; It was fucking nuts.&nbsp; Fur was flying, the yard was getting ripped up, it was fucking crazy!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point I yelled something from the window to try to break it up, no dice.&nbsp; I ran to the garage to grab ANYTHING before I stepped outside to start handing out furry woodland creature beatings but when I opened the side door, they were gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was actually really funny.&nbsp; I stood there kind of upset that I couldn't do anything, AND that I didn't get to find out what the hell that thing was.&nbsp; Then I realized I was standing outside in my underwear and I had lost sight of two predators that I had so brilliantly decided I was going to fuck with.&nbsp; After a brief WTF AM I THINKING moment, I decided to head inside and call it a night.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I checked out the spot this morning and there was only bobcat fur and a lot of the lawn was torn up.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","<p>Last night my mother's friend had a pipe burst in her house around 10 or so.&nbsp; So I had to rush over and try to see what the hell happened.&nbsp; The house was completely flooded and when I opened the closet door that the leak was coming from, shoes floated out.&nbsp; I ended up taking some drywall down to find the pipes just to see what the hell happened.&nbsp; With that all taken care of, I came home to try to relax and catch the end of the playoff game.&nbsp; Though I did get to see the game, relaxing was apparently not on the agenda.&nbsp; [Caution, heavy sarcasm ahead]&nbsp; Oh, thank the good Lord in the heaven that Megan has been blessed with unlimited text messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />God that sucked.&nbsp; It was like a horror film.&nbsp; You can just watch, and you can't do anything about it.&nbsp; First I shut the phone off, that just made the message pile up in the inbox.&nbsp; Then I changed the settings on the phone to keep it from opening messages automatically....that sucked.&nbsp; It's always great when you have to read half the message in the preview.&nbsp; shes in love with someone apparently, but my brain cant really deal with that at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankfully, I finally figured out how to block the goddamn texts, but not until last night sucked thoroughly.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Edit:&nbsp;&nbsp; See, just like that.&nbsp; Didn't read it, just deleted.

"event","<p>I just threw myself out of bed to gather my shit for the beach without my alarm going off.&nbsp; What the hell is wrong with me?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still really sick, and playing the show really only made things worse.&nbsp; Why my body randomly decided it was time to go surfing, I have no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; The funny thing is, if it weren't for this cold snap....I'd probably go.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...stupid addicting sport.&nbsp;&nbsp; I blame it all on my uncle's visit.&nbsp; Before he came down, I never really even to the beach.&nbsp; Then when he was here I practically lived there for a few days in a drunken haze, out on the water every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then I keep having the same dream.&nbsp; It's the first wave I caught when we paddled out this year.&nbsp; We just made it out and the biggest set of the day rolled in.&nbsp; He had the better line on it, but I had to catch it too.&nbsp; I couldn't let my 48 year old uncle out paddle me on a wave.&nbsp; My ego refused it.&nbsp; So I went nuts to try to get on this stupid ,chest high, closing out, slop-tastic wave just because I couldn't be shown up by my uncle.&nbsp; Well I paddle into it and I find myself in an 'oh shit' moment.&nbsp; I managed to catch it, but it was one helluva late takeoff.&nbsp; Stupid board damn near went vertical as I dropped.&nbsp; To this day that's the fastest my feet have ever moved as I shuffled back on the board to keep the nose up.&nbsp; It was also only the 3rd wave I've ever really 'dropped' in on.&nbsp; Everything around here you either grab, or you roll.....it rarely gets big enough for drop ins.&nbsp; Anyway, my uncle noticed the ordeal and fell off his board laughing.&nbsp; Felt pretty good though.&nbsp; While he was gargling white water&nbsp;from laughing at me, I was well on my way to taking the largest wave of the day in.&nbsp; Since then I keep trying to make more trips out, but either the weather won't cooperate, or I get sick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lame.&nbsp; </p>"

So instead of attempting the drawing I have since opted to do a survey I'm sure I've done before, but I thought it'd be fun.

"event","In about a week, I'm going to have a golden retriever puppy.  Emma.  My uncle is bringing her with him on his trip from TX.  After the holidays, he's heading to New York and leaving the dog with us.  She's completely spoiled, but really well trained.  He takes her every place he goes, and she knows how to surf.  She doesnt listen to my aunt real well so when she gets left here, it'll be up to me to take care of her.  I don't know why, but I'm really excited about that.  I'll finally have a beach dog.   


Besides...the last time I took Emma to the beach she was just a little puppy....and she introduced me to Camden and Stephanie.     


...Golden Retrievers rule.

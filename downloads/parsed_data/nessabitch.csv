and yc on saturday. im gettin so pumped up already. i have the biggest adrenaline rush right now i feel like running. maybe i should. 

i even got my period today and i could care less. that's the first time thats EVER happened i think. I've never had my period without horrible horrible cramps. 

and finding out about the 2nd yc show made my month complete. I mean yc can't come around without me seeing them more than once. I'd go nuts. MM yes go life. keep up the good work haha"

going to see brand new tomorrow and yc on saturday. oh yea dani we need to talk soon. 
i need to email people. i have some homework to do, not much though. hm. todays just rainy and boring. it makes me so lazy. i want my cuz to get outa school so i can go chill with her and figure out the show tomorrow and saturday. im so psyched for both of them, what a good week. 

does this only happen to me, there will be no shows for months then all of a sudden in the same week or span of a few weeks there will be 19057235823y959 shows to go to then im broke.

then they take a few months off and all come back again at the same time. lol i mean if brand new was a few more days behind they could be playin WITH yc again and that would be wayyy more worth seeing than soco. in my opinion at least. but o well 2 shows is still good. thats 2 nights of fun hehe 


i love shows.
they put me in a good mood for like 3 weeks. mmm. shows. haha"

If brian says one thing to me about just chillin out im gonna kill him. I don't chill out at shows and I warned him he might not have fun so i dunno we'll see. 

I found out yesterday that I'm going to see brand new wednesday. I totally forgot i told my cousin to get me a ticket if she was driving and she told me shes got permission and tix. I'm psyched. I didn't realize how much i liked brand new til I started getting all psyched up for the show. 

i got my car inspected finally. seeing as how my sticker expired in december. haha its april now. i got in touch with a kid i used to work with who now works at a inspection station and he hooked me up.

ok well im off to take a shower."

dude it's raining so hard out here.  I seriously could swim to class if I wanted to. And I have no gas in my car so I just might. haha

My dog is being SO annoying. He keeps coming up to me and biting my elbows. then barking. I hate that shit. It's like hellllooo can you leave me the fuck alone, you slept on my feet all night what else do you want from me? 

15 days til YC. WOO. I can't wait. It's gonna be so awesome. Dani's gonna be there, and my cousin, and brian, and of course the boys. I am so psyched. It's so closeeeee hehe. Mark and Angel and the cutest kid of the year are going to see them tonight. I'm jealous. If I lived on the west syde I'd see them SO much, but I don't so I just see them whenever they come here. 

Besides that I need to find another job. Hopefully a REAL job. one with REAL hours. not this 5-9, 11-9, 11-5 bullshit I've been fed the last year. If I can find decent hours I wouldnt even mind working saturday and sunday mornings at the pizza shop. I was gonna get that internship but I can't dedicate the majoirty of my time to something that's gonna cost more than graduating from Necco without a good paying job. 350 a month is a lot to shell out, I can barely shell out 153 ever other month for this semester. I have no money saved and I'm pretty much fucked. 

I just want the summer to come and I don't wanna have to work ever again. Maybe I should start buying scratch tickets lol. I wish i could just get put thru school so I wouldnt have to worry about anything but learning to get the hell outa there and into the real world.  But since I decided to drop out I said I'd cover my schooling. so i fucked myself over. dammit. lol 

OK I need gas and shit so I'm gonna go do that."

Today's april fool's day, I think I'm gonna tell brian im pregnant. I dunno tho thats kinda mean. 16 days til yc. :) WOO Dani I can't wait haha. 

I downloaded YC's live show from montreal, it's sweet cuz now I have a live YC cd with a label I made myself. 

Ok I have nothing else to write right this second, take that little thing I have below this. ""This is gonna stain"" haha. good shit. ok I'm out."

"event","So this weekend is slowly turning into a flop. My aunt doesnt want my cousin to go so I have to lie to her and tell her she can't go. It's completly unfair if you ask me.. Last night she said she could go and we booked 2 hotel rooms for 6 people.. now theres only 5 of us in 2 rooms. kinda pointless and now expensive. 

The show's sold out now too. So I don't even wanna go up there and bother the boys with getting me on the guest list. It's just not right to come to ben 2 shows in a row and be like look, it's sold out. I can't get in.. I feel like a dick for more than one reason and i dont like it. I totally dont wanna have to LIE to my cousin about this. Why can't everything just go as planned? Everything always gets too fucked up.. 

Last night the plans were set.. My brother and one of his friends, my cousin, my two aunts and I were going up to Vermont. We were gonna snowboard in the afternoon, then go to the show that night. My aunts were only gonna be 15 minutes away and we were still gonna get to stay in our hotel. now everything got fucked up. I don't understand why all of a sudden my aunt doesnt want anything to do with it.

After Mike talked some sense into me I figured this place isnt THAT bad. I mean, it could be a lot worse. I just gotta get away from some people. Today I got a new job, that makes 4. Come summer I think I'm gonna be working in boston interning if all goes well. If that doesn't go as planned I got back up at a little recording studio in town.. Hopefully I'll be doing SOMETHING I want to do. Pizza shops and Gas stations can't last forever.. I need to get on track with my work having to do with WHAT i want to do. not just money. 

But yea, as for now I still have to work a lot and I'm gonna have no more free time once I start this 4th job.. I cant believe how much I work and how much i DONT have any money. It's kinda annoying. Ah stop talking about work stupid



This weekend is gonna be insane. I'm more than excited. The fact that the whole weekend is gonna be so cheap makes me even more happy.. Plus I get to see them awesome boys in yellowcard again. It seems like I don't ever go that much time without seeing them, but it always feels like forever in between everything. I really love going to see them though, even if I didnt get to talk to them I'd still have a lot of fun. Their shows are always the shit. This is gonna be my 7th time seeing them and it totally feels like more, i guess you could count it as 8, but I mean times I've gone to see them play.

I also got a new dog sunday, his names Jake. He's awesome. I'll take pics and put them in here sometime in the near future."

"event","I'm sick of this place. That's the bottom line. I know I'm falling down the same path as all the other fuck ups here and I feel like I'm gonna be a fuck up for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm gonna do somethin stupid and get pregnant with someone I don't care about then be stuck here with him... hmm wow, that sounds EXACTLY like what my mom did... she's tryin to tell me that once you get away you'll always come back cuz its home here. but I don't understand how ANYONE could want their children raised here. Drive down washington street and you see a bunch of 3 family homes, some of them nice, some of them shabby.. Look inside each one, some people you know, others you've never seen before, but look inside and you see home after home of broken homes. Broken because their daddy left when they were too young.. broken because mommy drinks too much alcohol.. broken because mommy AND daddy both took off. Maybe they're crack heads and their kids are crack babies.. but its repetitive and it all makes me sad. What's worse is that Washington street is the street that all my ancestors who came over here from europe thuoght of as the promised land, and now look at it. it's disgusting, i wont even drive down it because i think im gonna get shot. 

The thing that bugs me the most is day after day i wake up feeling the same as i did the last. This place makes me feel worthless. I'm a high school drop out in community college. just like all my friends. we're a bunch of fucking idiots. I just want opportunity to do what I want. To start my own company.. Kids do it every day, I hear about 18 year old kids with successful busniesses and i look where they came from.. A nice town with money. Not a shitty hell hole that's been in debt for 20 years. it makes sense, their parents could help them out a little to get started.. mine can't. I wouldnt ever ask them to tho. 

I dont know what I'm getting at, mike helped me out a lot today, he put my mind back on track. I think i just went to  bed with a scrammbled head and woke up the same way not knowing what to do. I still hate this place tho."

It kinda helps tho. This is the only thing that makes me remotely better. Today has sucked since the second I woke up. My alarm didnt go off this morning. I was supposed to go to work at 930. I wake up at 922. By the time I was dressed and ready to go I had been crying for 15 minutes and I would have been a half hour late so I didnt even go. This is an invitation for both my parents to give me dirty looks and attitude all day. 

Why do they think that accomplishes anything? If they wanted me to feel better they could be a little bit more supportive. When I wake up and I'm flipping out because I'm gonna lose my job they dont have to sit around all day and bitch at me about everything I do wrong. Again, I can never do enough for them."

YOU HAVE NO LIFE ALL YOU DO IS SIT AROUND AND SMOKE POT! RAR RAR RAR! and im like mom, i was GONNA get it for you, but obviously you dont want anything to do with it if it pissed u off that much. and shes like oh yeah right, bullshit. 

ok thats the last time i think about buying her anything for christmas. fuck her. we finally stop fighting longer than a week and i think we can actually get thru a conversation and she goes back and picks me apart and tells me how much of a low life i am. THANK YOU, MOTHER! BUT I ALREADY KNOW MY INSECURITIES.. SO, FUCK OFF! 

i just figured out why im insecure too. my whole life shes been picking me apart and telling me ""I just wish you could get more involved in something. do something you like"" as long as I can remember shes been tellin me that.. So I did everything I could to find something.. I picked up snowboarding 5 years ago. I'm still obsessed with it.. oh but god forbid!! snowboard equipments too expensive for me to want to snowboard because then she'll have to buy me stuff with the money that she'd rather spend on drugs. 

<marquee> MY MOTHERS A CRACK WHORE!!!! </marquee> 

this makes me cry.. I take the time out of my busy life to sit down and look for something that she wants and something that I think she'll like and she shuts me down and fucks me over. i hate her. im never happy because im always worrying about if mom will be proud of me. she's never once told me she was proud of me. wait no, she did once. when i made JBS at brewster but she only said it over the phone. and that same night she was bitching at me again for something stupid. she hates me, i know it. deep down she wishes i would just leave and get out of her hair. so ill sit back and take it... why the hell not, theres something im actually good at.. i may not enjoy it but it makes her happy to yell at me and im good at taking the shit and holding it in. yeah. thats it. problem solved."

(all along we could have taken the train from haverhill...it would have been cheaper too.) so we leave his work and we go to the train station.. and we cant find the train station... so we have to go to newburyport, another 2 towns away. and we find that station at 2.. and its starting to rain now. so the train leaves at 245. so we sit on a bench for 45 mins looking thru free newspapers and whatnot. we finally get to boston at 335 and we have to be home by 6, so we have to take a 515 train. theres no time for the aquarium so we just walked around. we went to fanuel hall and ate, and we went to a magic store and bought mini fire works where u just pull the strings in different directions and it goes off.. and i got itching powder to put on some annoying bitch. lol. yeah. so that was boston. we got back at like 615 and we went home. lol. yea good day tho.. a lot of fun. yeah thats all the catching up you're getting today, im goin to watch the turkey day parade.."

I gave up and moved on. On to a new life almost. I mean, the same people are here, but theres more. I needed something more, I needed love. this week I've matured and grown up more than I could ever imagine. I learned that there is no secret behind life, you're just supposed to live it. i guess you could say that's the secret.. Living it to the fullest.

I just dont understand why he can't tell me anything. If he doesnt want anything to do with me then he should tell me so I can move on with my life and stop sitting around and waiting and wondering why. If he's just pissed and plans on talking to me again (which i doubt, cuz he should have done it by now) then he can tell me that too. he just sits there and doesnt fucking say a word. how am i supposed to know? I'm not a god damn fucking mind reader. this fucked my week up so bad. whenever we fight i get insecure and always seem to go out with someone. sometimes i feel like ""well, he lives 4 towns away, we havent seen each other in forever... why should i be torturing myself with loving him but not seeing him?"" then other times i'm like ""everything is perfect with him, im so in love, i dont want to be with anyone else forever."" and this changes like 4 times a day. they go back and forth. this is my day, I wake up thinking about him, i go to school and see his picture in my locker and think of him more. it was love at first sight. the FIRST time i saw him i was like thats the boy i'm gonna marry. I feel like Steve-O in SLC punk. thats what he felt like when he met brandi. but they were more meant to be. neither of them were TOO SHY TO SEE THE OTHER ONE! <--shitty excuse boys, never use it. See, I'm so miserable without him that I would rather deal with it being over forever and move on, then be miserable cuz i dont know whats gonna happen. god forbid he can tell me tho. all i wanna do is IM him rite now even tho hes away. i IMed him 2 nights ago and he never IMed me back or emailed me like i told him to, so i guess that means he hates me.. o man and the worst is once we get over a fight its like walking on egg shells for a few weeks.. so either way, if we fight for a month then start talking again its more like 2 months cuz u dont know if ur saying anything right at all. ok i've been blabbing for so long about this so i'm gonna go and have a good day."

I just wanted to tell the truth and not hide anything. he thinks the drugs are outa hand. he's right. weed is one thing but its a gateway drug n once u go thru that gate way theres no coming back. turning around is hard. im doing it tho and im doing it all for him. when i thought i was gonna die last night i was thinking about him and how much i love him and how i couldnt leave him here alone. if i died and i had to sit where ever the hell i ended up going and i had to watch him find out and be upset, that would be horrible. not even upset.. distraut, hurt, angry, alone. So i got myself out of my death bed and made myself feel better. and i did it for him. but thats not enough. for once im not mad for not doing enough because i understand what he went thru last night. i know im rambling on abuot the same stuff but its all im thinking about. i didnt sleep last night because of it and i couldnt go to school without sleeping. so i didnt. i feel like shit for making him feel so shitty about me, for making him lose a lot of trust in me and for making him worry about me every night. i just wish that he could talk to me about it. when hes pissed about something he just doesnt talk.. how am i supposed to know that im hurting him? i cant know if im not told. i cant read his mind. i cant be perfect either. everyone has to learn some way. so i always learn the hard way, oh well... at least i learn. and i learned more last night than i ever will. weed is a non harmless drug if you do it in moderation. if you abuse it, it can be just as dangerous. so this is the new me... ONLY WEED. different kinds of weed, but only weed. I've said this before and this time im more serious and i hope i have the fuckin self control to keep it this way. Last night was the scariest night of my life for me and shawn and I dont want either of us to have to go thru it again. I wont be able to live with myself if i hurt him again. 

i love him."

 GreenDayGirly119 [9:18 PM]:  its so annoying i just wanna go cry 
 GreenDayGirly119 [9:23 PM]:  but anyway... 

ok yeah, way to show some love... I'm only devoting every waking moment of my life for you and you dont even have the decency enough to come see me on the weekends yet you call me your girlfriend... prick.. 

o yeah and last week he had this little song for my in his profile.. this week its 

If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life
All I wanted
Was the keeping
Of someone like you
As it turns out
Deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, child, toy
You keep this love, fist, scar, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself 
No more head trips 

...so if they're usually about me, should I be taking a hint and leaving you alone?? No, I'll never know because you dont know how to fucking to talk me about anything. why do I do this to myself??"

This is not as easy as it sounds as you probably already know. so yeah, I'm going insane. withdrawl is the worst. I'm glad i'm strong and I havent given in. my conditions are a) clean up in a month and a half for a drug test and b) if I come home high before then, i'm shipped to Utah.. so I'm stuck. I've practically cried for 2 days straight and I dont even know why. Its not cuz im not high, its just that everythings wicked depressing to me. For example: a commercial with a woman who owned a chocolate factory that made little chocolate turtles... I fucking cried for a half hour because that woman was so happy with her god damn turtles. not clear enough? heres another.. while watching the world series natalie cole was singing the anthem. I cried because he dad was nat king cole and hes famous. it was like all the pain that anyone in the world had ever felt was being forced on to me at once. it sucks. I hate people too now. just about everyone I talk to I wanna hit because they're so stupid. 

People are giving me shit because I'm ""sXe""... ITS NOT MY FUCKING CHOICE!!! and even if it was, why would you give me shit? just because I want a little change in my life (or a big change) doesnt mean that i'm a different person.. it just means that theres not much that I do now. I'm just fucking sick of explaining the story every 5 mins. why can't people leave me alone so I dont have to talk about it?"

It just proves my point that no one really wants to talk to me in the first place. honestly, I talk and talk to people and they just sit there like ""yeah.. sure.. oh.. yeah.. i agree.. lol"" the same things over and over again.. no one really cares to think of anything. and this all happens while my mom is possessed by Satan. She hates me too. all she does is yell and scream at me about stupid shit and she makes me feel so inferrior to the world. I just sit and cry and take it because I can't give it back anymore. I used to be able to. Something wore me down over the years though, when she's mad at me theres nothing I can do but take it now. I miss the old days. When I was 4. Before my brother was born. I was an only child and I was fucking spoiled. Now i have shit. I hate shit. If shit was meant to have we wouldnt shit it out. my mom gives me shit like its christmas or something. god damn. i'll never be happy."

"event","ok brennas not coming to school today so i have some extra minutes to type before my mom has to take me... well last night was crazy.. let me start it at that... i got outa drivers ed and then tim got dropped off here at 7 cuz he felt like it.. then we walked to brooks and bought coricidin.. we took that at 750.. so it was gonna kick in at like 8:35-8:40ish.. now i don't know what went wrong.. maybe i was too high strung all night, maybe it was all the walking that we did to get to krays work, but it never kicked in. so kray bought some KB and shizat and i went home. so at 10:30 my phone rings.. by now im in bed and pissed off.. i figured it was timmy being like omg Quinn I'm so fucked up.. omg.. so i didnt wanna crawl out of bed for that cuz i wasn't fucked up at all. so at 2:30 i wake up and i get the spins and all of a sudden im tripping hardcore. wicked bad. i was like all of a sudden on speed but i couldnt see or walk and i kept seeing people in my room.. at one point i had a cigarette and was listening to the radio and smashing pumpkins were on and i thought billy corgan was on my bed.. i was like dude, u need to leave.. then i realized no one was there.. lol but i kept sayin really funny stuff last night to myself and i dont get it.. so then this morning my mom wakes me up and shes like Kray's car got stolen last night....... so now im stuck with this. right now i'm coming down from my trip and shit and now im wondering where the fuck krays car is.. who has it... if her pot was in the car..... if ahhh! anything! ah! i just dont know! its kinda cool tho cuz she might be gettin a new one.. at least thats what she said the other day when we THOUGHT her car got stolen.. we just parked it closer to the tree than we thought.. lol  ok im out.. heres some dane cook.. 

when i was a little kid i used to have crazy dreams because uh.. well do you remember that stuff, do you remember nestle's quick? you know, the powder, you'd put it in your milk, and you'd stir it for like, 30 mintues. no matter how hard u fucking...there were still chunks of powdery magma that would float up and expload in your eye while you're trying to drink. Take a sip... God damn a sand missle just  blew up in my eye.. the movie DUNE is in my chocolatey drink. I don't like when the movie dune is in my drink. Crazy.. When I was about 5 or 6 years old I took the powder and i snorted it. Because I heard about speed.. so I thought Speed... Quick.. I thought there was some kind of connection... So then I would have fucked up dreams because I was all ""hopped up on the Q"" as we call it on the streets. On my big wheel all strung out.. what am i doing with my fucking life here, man? yeah I play kick ball.. tomorrow...tomorrow.. I can't kick the ball today.. I'm not feelin it.. I'm not feelin the kick ball vibe... 
I'll tell you what dream used to scare me when I was a little kid. It used to actually totally give me nightmares. Remember those Kool-Aid commercials? Where that big talking bowl of punch.. he would come crashing through your fucking wall.. in your living room.. you wouldn't even know.. he'd be like ""OH YEAH... OH YEAH.. OH YEAH.."" right, and the little kids were all excited...""yes!! yes!!"" and then they would drink out of him after debris fell in his open.. dumb head.. he would pour himself, ""OH YEAH... OH YEAH..."" him and his crazy tights.. I don't like that. I don't like when juice wears tights.. Thats a horrible combination, a bowl of juice wearing... tights.. Fuck drinking out of him.. If that was me i'd be like no no no you fix that wall before my dad gets home from work hes gonna beat me with a belt.. hes not gonna belive a talking bowl of fruit punch came in here, you stupid idiot.  Yeah coming through the wall is real fucking cool.... using the front door is cool.. don't touch me you drink. don't touch me you giant beverage.. You are sweating or condensating. I will kick you in the tights, and you will go down.. you are very top heavy. You glass bitch.. you glass bastard.."

Oh yeah, the pricks at my school wont let u go to ur locker after 7. U have to wait til 725 which is when class starts. So if u wanted to go to ur locker and u got there at 705 u have to wait and carry around a heavy backpack until 725, then u have to go to ur class and ask ur teacher if its okay. what if u have class on the 2nd floor and ur lockers on the 1st? thats gayy. 

My mom dragged me to her friends house yesterday to see a psychic. he kept repeating to me about how i was gonna go to jail. and that i needed to stop drinking. ok bud, i dont drink. but now my mom thinks im a raging alcoholic. ""oosh.. yesh mom.. I'm drunk I think again."" yeah thats it. he also told me that if i wrote the song that ive been thinking about writing and if i send him a tape then i'll be rich and i'll have a tour bus of my own. and I can move to Nevada.. How the FUCK did he know that I wanted to move to Nevada??? most teen age girls wanna be in like California or something. I just dont get it. and why do I have to send my tape to him??? oh yeah.. it HAS to be on the piano. I gave piano up a while ago. I'm bad at it. 

Ok I dont think my ride is coming. Oh yeah, my watch died. I didnt realize how obsessive compulsive i was with the time. I NEED to know what time it is or i go insane. I had an anxiety attack yesterday when it died because i was in my moms car alone and there were no keys and no clock and i didnt know what time it was. and i was there for a long time. and ahhhhhhh what the fuck am I supposed to do? i cant read those stupid clocks in school. ok I really need to go back to bed. I wonder if I'll be able to.. 

I bet brenna wont come today. If she doesnt I could probably go to bed and get away with it.. my moms in the shower.. just as long as I got everything else in my room. wait no i have drivers ed. I cant do this. fuck..

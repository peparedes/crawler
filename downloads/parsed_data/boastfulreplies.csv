"event","well.  i know this is a little late.  but it needed to be done sooner or later.

on november 2, 2004  40 million people broke my heart.

when your country decides that war, debt, dictatorship and lies are a good thing, there isnt much left for you to hope for.

when you pray for months that people will see what has been happening before their eyes, and then they dont, there isnt much left for you to believe in.

when you see your fellow citizens and feel shame, its time for a change.  

when you see families divided because of two other human beings, you wonder if the fear they want you to feel is winning.

when people are led by media, and the media feeds them fear, their better judgement goes numb.  and these people, i cannot look in the eye.  

right now.  i am working on getting out of debt, becoming fluent in french, and learning about french history.  because over there.  they dont let the media rule their lives.  so at least ive been told."

--driving in tropical storms.

--reading the ever brilliant hunter s. thompson.

"event","its a little hard for me to recognize you anymore.  everything seems split right down the middle.  their are two sides of everything.  the side i know very well and love, and the dark side that im not really sure is the real.  this is true for everything lately, not just the people i think i know.  that dark side from my perception seems to be the side that everyone else loves but i think its fake and they are deceived.  but who knows?  maybe im the deceived one.  i have a tendency to romanticize situations and people.  not that i believe the side i see is perfect.  but i believe the dark side is a little too perfect.  i also believe i have been slowly weeded out, once again.  and also once again, i cant think of what it is i did.  and i cant seem to settle on a simple ""drifting apart"".  i hope you read this and know that its you im trying to get the message to.  but then again, i hope you pass it off as a insane rant.  just so i can avoid confrontation. blah.  i suck for writing on livejournal."

"event","i dont usually write like this in live journal.  i usually save it for my written journal, and i probably will write it there too, but i felt i needed to share this.  it will be long.  but please read.

i am going to attempt to relay exactly how i feel at this moment.  guilty, deceived, used, manipulated, emotionally sick, gross, dirty (not in the un-bathed way), helpless, frightened--terrified--hurt, remorseful, deprived, cheated.  and knowing that there is nothing hopeful in the future to relieve these feelings gives me an unsettling feeling.  it gives me more feelings that i cannot name.  and all because of a powerful film (WHICH YOU SHOULD ALL SEE!!) titled Farenheit 9/11.  all i can do is vote and pray for the best.  but i have lost faith in mankind.  i feel like a naive infant being told what the world is really like.  being told that while im loved now, people will deceive me and lie and not everyone will have love in their hearts but that thats just the way life is so i have to accept it.  i have no faith in anyone anymore.  i feel so lost.  i have never been so afraid in my life.  

one thing i know for sure--it never ceases to amaze me that people will hold onto God when there seems to be no god in sight.  that while children are being viciously murdered a mother will still cry out to God for help.  and that takes some made faith.  but who else are you going to turn to?  do you know anyone else who has never broken a promise?  im not trying to preach to you...im just stating that while i have no faith in humanity and life seems bleak...there are people who have lost families who do still have some faith left.  and those are people who are strong willed.   i have never felt so helpless.  usually there is something i can do to feel like ive helped.  but voting doesnt seem good enough.  i cant give back the iraqi's there children. i cant bring back to life the 3,000 people who died on september 11th.  i cant change the course our country and its greedy leaders have set for us.  i see a decline in humanity and the value of life.  when fear and war and uncertainty seem to all around me i cant help but wonder where all the Franklin D. Roosevelts have gone.  im not sure whats worth fighting for anymore.  i would fight to save a family member or any of my loved ones, but other than that, there isnt any cause im willing to back.  because everything seems corrupt.  i dont trust anyone.  i feel violated.  i feel molested by a hand ive never seen.  i feel raped of knowledge, opinions, and rights.  and i dont even know where to point the blame.  i feel so alone in a vast world that is involved with itself.  i am one small person who can not do anything.  even if i were to get together a large group of people who felt the same, i feel there would be no change.  and i want to quote john lennon and say ""all you need is love.""  or ""give peace a chance"".  but instead i will quote him with something that seems more honest and fitting:
""It's fear of the unknown. The unknown is what it is. And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams, illusions, wars, peace, love, hate, all that--it's all illusion. Unknown is what it is. Accept that it's unknown and it's plain sailing. Everything is unknown--then you're ahead of the game. That's what it is. Right?""
where have firm believers in humanity--such as john lennon--gone?  i want to crawl into my mother's arms like a child and be comforted.  but im not a child.  i am aware of what has happened.  im just not aware of what will happen.  so all i can do is surround myself with my friends and family who have never steered me wrong and know that i lived with love.  because there isnt anythng else to do.  all i can do is love.  i dont know how naive that sounds.  and i dont care.  love is all i can hope for right now until i forget the images and facts and feelings that were registered inside me tonight."

her baby is sick and she has a meeting tomorrow that she cant miss.  its not my life or my family.  so i shouldnt care.  but i do.  

anyhow.  went out to the mall today while bill did his christmas shopping.  it was nice.  boys are fun to shop with because they know what they want and they get it and they leave.  and its good."

and i am happy today.  and most days recently.  of course i dont remember half of last week because of all the drugs but, what of it?  im just glad i have a bill who will sleep all day with me and come over and be with me every moment that he can.  and im lucky i didnt get fucking dry sockets.

"event","for those of you who didnt know...i AM marilee buckley's slave. 
me having a flat tire completely ruined her plans of sun bathing this afternoon.  
i feel sorry for marilee.
my debts and bills come second to marilee's obsession with me having a cell phone so she can ""trust me"".
i will obey my master.
i did not pass preschool so what i thought was only a 1 on the schedule was actually a 12--because marilee buckley said so.  
i should be branded and whipped.
i have no life of my own.  my life IS marilee.
i want to be just like her.  
i can drive two hours on a donut tire because it pleases mrs. buckley.
her wish is my comman
my feelings and self respect are non existent because marilee wants it that way.  so that is the way it is.
marilee is so rich and so wonderful and street urchins like myself have no business having feelings and/or expressing them.
or so marilee would have it in her own selfish, i-sucked-rich-cock-so-now-im-psuedo-rich-so-pity-me-because-i-dont-know-how-to-love-my-children world.

needless to say...I HATE MY JOB.

in the past three weeks i have been told that--despite the fact that i've been taking care of children for 9 years--i dont know what i'm doing, i need child care training, and that i have no personality.
i have been patronized, degraded, and seen as worthless.  

thats alright though.  i'll just put on my apron and sit with my chilluns in our hay stack.
OR.  i could be like rosie on the jetsons.  you know.  their robot.  because thats all marilee sees me as anyway.  

another thing that sucks about my job is that before i didnt really put a stereotype on rich people and i didnt really ever want to.  but, now i do have stereotypes and i hate it.  cuz myabe, just maybe (you can't hear me laughing at myself for what im about to say) some rich people aren't like that."

"event","this past weekend bill and i escaped to tampa and went to busch gardens.  where i rode my first roller coaster...the python.  i have been told that this is the pussy roller coaster and that kumba is the best...or one of the best.  but i liked the pussy one because its just that....a pussy, like me.  it scared the shit out of me and i wasnt able to convince myself to go on it or any other roller coasters for the rest of the day.  now, though, looking back it was the funnest ride that i went on and now i regret not going on at least kumba with its huge i-hope-i-dont-fall-out-and-die 128 foot drop.  but.  it is okay that i didnt because we might just go back next friday with some other people and then i'll ride it being as ready as i'll ever be.  then i'll know.  

but yeah.  bill and i saw two chimps making out.  and they were about to make the fuck but it took too long for the male to pick the fleas off the female so we left them to their sex romp and looked at gorillas.  

and what else?  i miss ellie.  we need to hang out more.

and.......youre STILL a dick.  you'll never change.  i wish she had broken YOURE heart instead of the other way around.  why does this bother me so much?  if you hate secrets then why do you have so many?  and if you hate secrets then you'll really hate how yours falls out of my mouth and into her ears.  oh.  this really is stupid.  its not even my problem.  but i guess i hate that she sounds like i did and i guess i hate that i--or anyone--could feel that way over someone petty like YOU.  it doesnt seem fair.  

happier times to mention.  bill and i are doing well.  and i am happy.  

my mom is out of town and i miss her so much.  i hate when people i love go away cuz i worry too much.  mom, kevin, and andrew all need to get themselves home where i can feel like they are safe.  damn im such a worry wart.

BUT!  my dad is safe.  all that gross evil shit is out of his blood and he only has a few more weeks of treatment and he'll be happy again im sure.  i am so happy.  i think i might even have faith again.  now if only he would quit smoking......

i have finally found a job.  im working as a nanny for some really fucking uber rich people.  it seems like a nice, laid back job.  the strangest thing i could find so far is the way the mom likes her laundry folded.  but, oh well.  everyone is particular about something i s'pose.

so last night i got some maddddd sleep.  it feels so good to wake up on your own.  not to kids, barking dogs, or an alarm.  damn that shit is nice when you wake up realizing you've been asleep for twelve hours and you feel totally refreshed.  and then your mom asks you if you want a cup of coffee and youre like ""yes."" but not because youre tired, but because you just want some gooooood coffee.  and i didnt even need a nap today i felt so good.  until the night, but thats something else not to be spoken of on LJ.  but yeah, the only thing was i accidently blew bill off by taking a ""nap"".  but now i get to spend the night.  so, yay.

"event","my mom took away our internet access.  so now i will be updating from bill's room.  

STEVE-O:  please call me.  sorry i didnt come last night.  i stil want to talk to you.  :)

everything has been pretty good as of late.  however i still cant find a job which is probably due to:

A.  baby sitting too much
and
B.  my laziness and desire to rest and be with bill when im not baby sitting

but please, if any of you know somewhere thats hiring, please let me know.

yesterday bill and i took some kids to fly kites at the beach.  we came back tired and with a realization that being with kids allllllllllll day is uber hard. and theres that.   however.  watching bill and the kids fly kites was rather enjoyable.  it was a tiring but amusing day.  especially when little sarah ran her head into the corner of the wall and cried.  or when patrick gave bills socks to the dog to use for a toy and bill said next time he does that hes gonna give patricks face to the dog.  and patrick goes ""do you know what would happen if you did that?"" to which bill replies ""she'd be an ugly dog"".  and patrick didnt get the insult.  

we watched punch drunk love last night.  let me tell you about confusion that movie brings.  it is so odd, but good.  really good, i thought.  its weird to see adam sandler not try to be funny.  it brings a smile to one's face.

i want to go to a good show.  and i want to go soon.  like tonight.  but, there are no shows that spark my interest lately.  ah well.

so, ive been listening to unwritten law recently for no reason at all.  i dont think i even like most of their songs.  i only like maybe two.  actually its like one.  but i have this burnt cd with two songs from when i did like them.  and ive been listening to that for a few days now.  not that this paragraph has anything to do with anything.  just wrote it.  

now ive rambled too long.  must go.  bye."

watched a bit of friends today.  yep.  

does anyone know if pandas are bears or marsupials?  i need to know.  like BAD.

at bill's right now.  i think im about to play the sims.  during this time i will make bill and i a baby.  and it will be beautiful.  unlike you.

ha.
ha.
ha.

just kidding.  

oil changed today.  followed by the cleaning of my entire house (minus my room).  bill brought up a point about my room awhile ago which was there isnt a reason why my room should be so messy because im never in it except to sleep.  but thats just me.  thats how it happens when youre lazy.

nothing is new, really.  

i wanna get drunk.  not just drunk, but plastered.  piss drunk.  yep.  thats right."

"event","because the curriculum at my school is almost nil, we watched moonwalker or whatever that michael jackson movie is.  and i talked almost the whole time to some girls.  but then, i stopped and heard something that hurt my ears so badly.  it was michael jackson singing a cover of ""come together"".  now tell me.  someone please.  why is it that people are allowed to destroy beatles music like that?  do you know how much money that michael jackson movie made?  too much.  i wouldnt care if it didnt have that cover in it.  its a good song-- but it should be left to the beatles to sing it.  


but something cute happened today--i was asked not to say ""bitch"".

i said something about ""i just like to bitch"" and martha told me to say ""Gripe"".  she said that she knows words just slip out sometimes, but please, if i could, control the cursing.  and i wasnt mad, but actually quite amused and i couldnt believe she said ""gripe"".  its funny is what it is.  but i must respect he wishes."

"event","Recently I had a person tell me to ""leave them the fuck alone"" because we had nothing in common anymore. This particular person was my best friend basically all throughout high school...we did everything together, attached at the hip. 

She slept in her closet and I thought that was the most awesome thing in the world. 
She made my Christmas cards every year...big ones...like folded poster board size. 
Her mom was awesome. Literally...just awesome, no other words to describe. 

I fell out of touch with her for whatever stupid reason and when I kept trying to add her and contact her on facebook she would ignore me. Eventually I got an angry message telling me to leave her alone. 

Apparently I have changed. She has too but why I was being told I wasn't even good enough to be her friend on facebook, I have not a clue. 

Maybe she just truly doesn't want ANYTHING to do with me for whatever her reason but if the hope to talk to her again ends I just want to end it like this. 

I am 21 years old, getting married in 5 months to the man i've been with for over 4 years. I live on my own right down the road from my parents because I don't want to move too far away from them. I have a dog, a cat and no job.

I have been following her journal up until now, figuring that as soon as I posted something she would see it and delete me so if she does, I hope she at least reads this first. 


I am in school right now to be a pastry chef. I bake all the time and that is pretty much my only hobby. I hate assholes who judge me before they have even met me. I tell people how I feel about them no matter who they are. I love Green Day and always will. I eat soy products and love them. I take photos of myself when no one is around. I leave homework until the last minute. But I would never write this: ""I will never ever fully understand this need that some people have to be cruel to others."" and then say what was said to me to someone that was my best friend for years. 

I am still the same person, just grown up. YOU'RE the one that changed. YOU'RE the one that pushed me away when I gave YOU a chance. YOU'RE the fucked up person, not me. YOU will end up alone NOT me. You're the hypocrit who yells at people not to judge you then turn around and tell ME that I am different and you want nothing to do with me because you think you know that I have changed from a facebook page. YOU. Not me. 

So rot in YOUR change. After reading your journal I don't even know why I tried with you. I did at the moment but now I have no idea what I was even thinking. You've become a horrible person. 

And FUCK YOU for what you said about James. He is an awesome person, NOT a creep. He is the kindest person I have ever met that would do anything for anyone."

"event","Wow. It has most certainly been a long and interesting month. 

August, that is. 

The month began interestingly with our big move. Big meaning it took us 12 hours...We actually only moved 2 buildings over. hahah. It was horrible and I know for damn sure I am PAYING someone to do it next time! This place is amazing though. So amazing. It's way bigger, it's got a great view from the balcony (which is attached to our house now) and it's really really private. I love it. I kinda don't want to leave in 14 months but Dan says that by the time our lease is up here we will be able to own a house. =] Which is totally effin awesome cuz that is like a gigantic step for us! 

I have total marriage fever. I know, lame, right? It just seems like everyone is getting engaged and married and having babies! UGH! I know I am a little young but I am not too young to know that Dan is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with! Wow, in November it will be 3 years that we have been together! a long time for me. haha. I am in love with him and I can't wait to get married and have lil babies! 

I FINALLY finished my hours after much hell and bullshiting from, you guessed it...WOMEN. I despise them. Death to them, seriously. I turned in my hours and hopefully I can send away for my license soon!

I start work tomorrow temporarily at Things Remembered in Laguna Hills mall just so I can have money. We'll see how that goes!

We have a wedding to go to at the beginning of September and weddings always make us happy. haha.

For the most part...

sheesh mama. Ima go...Dan is almost home from work.

"event","So I'm not going to write too much about this because it depresses me but my sister went out to New York to visit my grandma and they got in a car accident. A really bad one. My sister and her boyfriend are fine but My grandma got some pretty bad damage. They had to remove part of her skull because of bleeding on her brain. She is stable now and slowly coming out of the coma they induced but they think that when she wakes up she won't be able to talk, walk or respond to things we say to her. I, on the other hand have more hope. Stranger things have happened. I just want her to live. 

Problem is that she has a living will that states if she sustains an injury that leaves her incapable of taking care of herself she wants the plug to be pulled on herself. I feel selfish for wanting her to live. I just can't imagine my life without her. 

In happier things...we are moving in 11 days. We never planned on moving. We went in today to the leasing office to tell them that we were staying and i asked (out of curiosity) ""so how much is your cheapest 2 bedroom in here?"" We ended up signing a lease for a one bedroom and den (which has doors so it might as well be a 2 bedroom) for 100 more dollars than we're paying for a one bedroom. It's bigger too. And on the 2nd floor. Only problem is that I have to move on my moms birthday and 9 days before mine...the weekend before my bday party. ugh!!!So much shit going on. 

My tests are next week...certification and final in class. 

Nothing like a stress-filled summer. To top it off, birch is in jail. Wow. just wow. 

Here is to hoping for a miracle and that I will look back on this summer and say ""i'm glad this is the worst it could be""

I also finally convinced dan to be okay with me being on birth control so i'm dragging Bri to Planned Parenthood on Tuesday. Hahahaha. Not because I want to hide it from my mom...but because i don't have an appointment at the GINE doctor until like September. So yeah, I'm pretty stoked about that. =]

My birthday is in a month. I planned Knotts, Brunch and Fondue dinner =]
I like extending my birthday as long as i possibly can...hahaha. Plus, Dan has something planned for my actual birthday but it's a surprise so I have no clue what it is =] but I know it will be good because he is a good planner when he puts his mind to it! I love him. 

I'm nervous about my hospital work but I'm hoping it will go by fast cuz I don't have the patience  to be working in a place and not getting paid for it...I need some income BIG TIME! Hopefully by September I'll have a job...maybe even October.

"event","General: Things could be better. My house is a mess, I am home with a bladder infection (after being sick with the flu all week) and my cats are pissing me off. I have a Wal Mart trip to pick up some AZO to look forward to and that would be about it for my friday night. 

Work: Non-existent still, of course. I've been on enough interviews to officially be able to read all the hiring manager's minds. I think either that or I am becoming a professional interviewer...that COULD be a profession. I can get a job with Sarah but it's unfortunate because it only starts at 8.75 and I need a bit more than that to survive in the money eating hell hole that we call aliso viejo. My head hurts...I don't want to interview anymore...for the rest of my life...and a few more lives after this one.

Cakes: Good, I got a cupcake gig finally...my first one. A 14 year old's bowling birthday party. haha. I finally get to make bowling ball cupcakes...I've been waiting for this moment for god knows how long. Tomorrow, I'm making my friend Sam a cake for his birthday...well, I was going to make A cake but i took a trip to Michaels and everything I had originally planned is now changed. yay. I've decided on little individual cakes filled with chocolate pudding and covered with chocolate ganache and chocolate decorations. Overload. 

What grinds my gears: This damn headache. Cranberry juice. The fact that a man can have a secret apartment for 4 years living inside of a mall and I can't even keep a job. Being awake since 5am. Also, i'd like to add that staffing companies are complete SHITE and they don't help me AT ALL. I've gone to 7 different ones and not one has called me back. Shoot me in the face. 

What's making me giggle: The fact that tonight, I'm going to take a vicodin and retire to the couch to watch the blank screen and not feel any pain or tiredness...I'll be asleep.

TV: Still pissed that I missed the second episode of House but it made up for it when I got to see the new Gordon Ramsey show. The man is a genius. I saw the first House...but at Ulrich's house...taped on his TIVO...just not the same. 

Actual relevant stuff: I start school in January. Hopefully phlebotomy will snap with me and I will get it perfect and I'll be out of corporate shit like office jobs in no time. I can see myself in a hospital setting, drawing nervous people's blood, joking about how I am not really a phlebotomist, but a vampire and I won't test the specimen, I will drink it for my health. I'll do good with the kids too. Damn. 

Movies: A few movies out that I want to see...Good luck Chuck, Resident Evil...blah blah. I heard that Heartbreak kid was shite...lots of sex scenes...but thats the reason I concentrate on movies...for the sex scenes. I watched Double Jeopardy for the first time at home...I liked it a lot. It was one of those movies where you want to jump in the screen and smack someone across the face. Or yell at the tv.

5 Things I'm Loving Right Now:
1. vicodin.
2. Fudgie sticks.
3. super concentrated cranberry pills. 
4. friends
5. this random magazine i'm reading."

Other than that, i was the only one working for a company who DIDNT observe memorial day (my boss is a prick...or he doesn't like to remember things) So it took me 7 minutes instead of 25 to get to work today..bust.

I'm debating on whether or not I should take an assistant manager position next school semester which means Less class and more work which would be shitty because I would like to transfer soon but if I did it, I would be able to move out next year AND pay for a new car AND probably be able to go back to school...who knows. It's just one of those confusing points in my life, you know?

I'm waiting for Dan to wake up so we can go to IHOP...he sleeps too much. Come Hungry, leave happy...thats what I always say. 

Not.

I got my halloween costume...a slutty cop. Dan will flip. The weekend before Halloween I am going riding (dirtbike) with my family and dan...it will be awesome. I'm having a halloween party, too =]

It's been a pretty shitty week for all of us. Too many reasons to list, of course. I'm too hungry to think much.

in fact, im not even going to continue."

His name is Kirby. He belonged to Aubrey and Steve but both of her parents wouldn't allow it in the house anymore. =[

Tomorrow, before we give him to my mom, we're going to go buy him some treats and a bowl and his own little baby collar and some things for him to scratch on. 


=] Me mums going to be so excited. 


Anyways, I'm fucking off my mind right now and I dont even know what I'm typing anymore. 

But all I know is that I want Daniel. Right now. Maybe not RIGHT now, but when I wake up. 

wow. Tomorrow is movie day....or today? =]

Me ed es spinnin round and round. 

My mom is going to LOVE Kirby. He's a little bugger. Hopefully Cooper will like him so he can have a new friend. =]

So my cat is dead. Ceaser. I had him for nearly 10 years...I grew up with that cat and now he was gone. Fucking coyotes. 

If I see a fucking coyote I am going to stab it to death. 

I'm fucking devastated. Bloody Fucking Devastated. 

And you know what? That's all the fucking whining I'm going to do about it. 

I'm going to stop trying to be a good friend because it only makes people pissed off. 

I've been through a lot. I give good advice. Always. Don't hate me. Rediculous. 

I want fucking pizza! Now. Dan's sleeping, I can't drive his car on my own, mine isn't here. 

My period is coming. I hate it. 

Dan is so beautiful when he sleeps though. I wish I could watch him sleep all the time. 

I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. After all the shit I've had to endure, he is the one thing that keeps me breathing. 

I still want Pizza. The little individual pizzas that they sell at Taco Bell. for 5 bucks I get a pizza, a huge fuck off soda and 3 breadsticks, sometimes 4 if the guy at the window thinks you're cute. 

UGH!

Nearly 7. I'm going to get my mother an animal for her birthday, she is sad.

<i>I love him. </i>

I find that if you make it obvious that you dont always want to see him, then he comes around more. 

Example: I told boyfriend that ""ehh, just relax tonight baby...ill see you tomorrow""

He agrees then proceeds to text me 2 hours later asking me what I am doing...I reply ""oh nothing, just going home."" and he shows up. Suprise!

He does that. <b>that's</b> why i love him.

In other news, my birthday countdown has lowered itself to 22 days. I'm thinking that the weekend before my birthday a fondue party will be in order. =] for all the friends who do not get to accompany me on my vegas birthday trip. 


I need my eyebrows waxed because i am too lazy to pluck them...Then i need to get them done again before I leave for Vegas....What do you girls think about a bikini wax? Ow, right? Nevermind.

I have 13 more days...BUT that is including the weekends and the days where i dont have to be at school so technically i have...5 REAL school days. Monday is the Knotts Berry Farm senior trip and then the following Wednesday is when we pick up our caps and gowns and do a senior picnic. Hmm. 

Scary huh? 

I guess this is what it feels like to be done. 

It's an amazing feeling. 


I'm in love, by the way...did i mention that? His name is Daniel and we're going to get married and have beautiful little children who are smart (from his side) and good looking (from mine) hahahahaha. JK!!! =]

It will be nice. He is looking for a room mate so he can officially move out and be on his own. We wait for the day. If you know anyone that is reliable and interested with a good job then please let me know. Thankaaa.

Other than that..this weekend owned ALL WEEKENDS. We keep out-doing ourselves. I dont know what it is. 

graduation is soon.

I decided i want to be a writer...preferably for a magazine. It will get me further than anything else i could be doing as a career. Just need to work hard. He supports me. I love him.

Maybe the dirt is actually things ive done wrong. 
like my song
""thats not dirt under your nails, that's sympathy invisible""
I wrote that song about Chris. 

Ugh. Chris. 

<b>You know what I'm wondering?</b>

WHY NONE OF YOU SLAPPED ME IN THE FUCKING FACE AND PUNCHED ME IN THE FUCKING HEAD FOR GOING OUT WITH THAT PRICK! I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIENDS!?

<font color=orange>Forgiven.</font>

You know what i liked about Chris? He was easy to break.I didnt feel bad when i broke up with him. Losing him didnt hurt. 

<i>nicole is better now</i>

ANYWAYS. Dan and I are trying our best to not fight as much anymore. Fighting hurts. Makeup sex is nice. Hahaha. Havent had that yet, actually. When Daniel and i make up we go out and do something and it makes us realize that our appreciation for eachother's company is way important. It's hard to realize that when we dont go out and do things. Sitting in the house isnt fun ALL the time. I mean, sometimes im tired and sometimes he is tired and sometimes we just dont want to go anywhere...yanno? But we should still go out on the weekends at least...it keeps our relationship alive. It makes us happy. </center>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I know his house is haunted. I feel things. I want to make contact. I need to know what else is out there. Contact. Although most people will believe that any contact with them will result in my freaking out and being afraid...its wrong. Yes, i MAY be scared but freaking out is the last thing i would do. It is exciting. This is amazing. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

<h3>Now its time for the random thoughts of the day section!!!</h3>

<tt>My nails are too long. I have to pee. I need to find a new job. Im trying to decide if im going to be ready to move out soon. I want to live with Dan. I love Dan. Love makes you do crazy things. And dumb things. And beautiful things. Love is beautiful. I dont know why Aubrey doesnt have a bf. she's so beautiful. Im going to do her soon if no one does. hahaha. ?. 20 minutes until i can go home. I havent seen Aiden in a while. I miss him. I miss Kelsea. Prom is coming soon. Im going dress shopping on Saturday. I want a white dress. I want Dan to wear a white tux. That'd be so funny. Would a white dress look too much like a wedding? I want something i would never wear! I want to look absolutly beautiful! I want it to be tomorrow. hahah. I'm glad i get to spend it with Daniel. =D Im glad i get to spend it with Aubrey and Jessica and John and hopefully Shauna. I want Dan to grow that little patch of chin hair back. Sam is hilarious. I miss Sam. I want to have another bonfire. This time with fire. Where is alysia =[. Im excited for a bunch of things. Pablo Fransisco is on May 7th! I want to plan a wedding. Maybe i should be a wedding planner? Maybe i should write articles for cosmopolitan!? What should i do? I want to be cute this summer. I need to run. I like running. I want to go home. I smell gum. IM IN LOVE!"

I do have to wonder why everything works out like it does, for me especially. I went through a long period of feeling unworthy of the special people i had in my life. That period was followed by a period of realization, and finally a period of revenge. No...i dont necessarily see my happiness as revenge towards anyone that has ever fucked with me in the wrong way, i see it as redemption. I see it as me finally getting what i deserve. All of the giving has finally caught up with me. 

<i>I cant breathe, i cant calm down.</i>


Daniel and i are asses to eachother sometimes. 
We also joke around a lot.
Oddly enough, they both come at relatively the same time. 

I forgive him. He forgives me. 

Saturday was our 4 month anniversary...Not too shabby...4 months. 16 weeks. roughly 120 days. 2880 hours. 172800 minutes. 10368000 seconds...im done. But yes...thats how i see it. May is half a year. accomplisment...its going by way slow but it feels fast.

12 weeks and i graduate. Scary. We start the countdown. I want out anyway. I want to be done with it. I want to go to college already. Im sick of shallow high school bullshit. 

I find myself to be unmotivated in a bad way. Im fine with work. Im fine with seeing Daniel. Im fine with being home and my Law enforcement class. But when it comes to high school i look for every oppourtunity to get out of it...which is not good...seeing as i have 12 weeks to graduate. 

I have to get my running practice in.
In badminton we have to run a mile and a half in 20 minutes.
It's 20 % of our grade.
Its an all or no situation. 
Meaning if i dont get 6 laps, i fail.
If i keep doing that i will fail the class.
I need that class to graduate.
<b>Im fucked.</b>

I want a band again. I talked to Riley and we set up a jam day. Saturday. I want this band. I want it to work this time. I need this.

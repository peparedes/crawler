"event","its monday and i stayed up until 5 or 6 or so this morning because i couldn't sleep and i had work to do.  the birds in our courtyard are never quiet and vicky was going to bed so she closed the window and it was too hot to work in the room so i went downstairs and read black reconstruction docs for a while, and chatted with chaps and abe and dan(s).  it was nice, but i should have got sleep.  

my 10-12 page paper is due on next monday, not wednesday so all my work was just really good preperation, rather than me freaking out.  i have a final on tuesday, wednesday and friday. am i excited or what? not really, more excited just to go home."

"event","did you know Perkins had a sub basement? they even have a fire door between the basement and sub-basement so if you were raped no one would hear you scream.  i spent 3 hours in perkins reading old periodicals and checking out books, i have a hella lot of reading to do in the next couple of days.  i've swore off bassett too, which might sound like some expensive kind of alcohol, (lol, i hear you laughing), but no, it's just the friendly dorm nextdoor which houses some of my favorite soul-mates. and really most of my closest friends.  the thing is very few of them have ever been over to my dorm/room which is RIGHT NEXT DOOR to visit me, so i'm staying in until they come to me.  silly, maybe, stubborn, yes but i'll probably get more work done this way.  i have to finish my taxes before late tomorrow, a la ""marianne"" style. i am my mother's daughter. tomorrow is my last thursday of classes, and i have...no class, just 4 hours of work, so i need to get to bed now. talk soon, love lots."

"event","rebecca's mom was in town to see her play water polo at a tournament in UNC, so she took us out to dinner in chapel hill to spanky's.  Meghan, Rob, David Walker, Jared, Wint, Molly, Emily Carry, Rebecca and me. fantastic food, but i couldn't eat very much, walking around in CHapel hill made me miss home and EL and college towns in general.  made me appreciate what college town life i do have at home, even though i didn't start hanging out downtown until senioryear.  and the first year is almost over.  oh well.  we took the robertson bus home and then a central bus back to east.  and i'm just procrastinating now, trying not to do the chem lab that is due tomorrow.  so i'll just say goodnight.
i still want to play tennis."

"event","wow i haven't posted in  along time, doesn't really matter tho, because no one actually reads this, lots has happened since that AEII mixer at georges annex, but i don't really want to regale my life online, so i'll just bring you up to date with the most recent news.  

went to san antonio, that was amazing.  left on friday right after my chem test, shawn drove me to the airport and i left at 2:15, stayed with Sam's parents (who were amazing) in Houston, and then drove with the boys (Frank, Jake, Drew and Seth) to Jake's house in La Vernia (outside san antonio) ( a 3 hour drive), a lot of texas reminded me of michigan, Very flat.  Jake's mom was amazing, every time we came into the house she offered us food, and was such an amazing hostess.  We took in the gorgeous beauty of the ranch Jake lives on and went into the city around 5-ish for the game.

 Watched the game from the front row behind the basket, G-tech game was fun, i gues, i didn't really care, the duke/uconn game (cough* championship game *cough) was amazing, for a while, and then i realized that the refs were from hartford and intent on throwing the game.  Donald Wine was there, Nan, Dick B., Crazy towel guy (who was on the boys' flight), lots of alum, several more administrators that i swear i've seen before but don't talk to me so i don't know thier names, Eric, my fac Jeff, some tri-delts that i remember from rush, some catholics that looked familiar and jesse l. who i shared flights with me over from Durham.  We left, were sad, drove home and fell asleep.

 seth found a flight home and we took him to the airport in San antonio on sunday, then we drove up to UT-Austin to visit some friends of Frank's and Drew's.  That was quality...very pretty and very big and spread out.

Sunday came home, and it kind of started raining, i wanted to go back into the city to see joe before the team left, but there were tornado warnings between la vernia and san antonio, so we ended up staying in for the night, Drew and i arguing why i wouldn't play strip poker with them.  

yeah...ok.

monday, we woke up late-ish, ate breakfast/lunch at a tex-mex place near jake's house something-something #2, i can't remember the name, but it was good.  the south, i mean, texas rather, really is a different place, nothing was open on sunday and on monday this little restaurant seemed like the buzzing center of community.  We went into san antonio, later and walked around the river walk, buying souviners and such. Saw Dick VItale not more than 10 feet away, he's SO cool man, i swear. G-tech and Uconn fans were yelling all around the river. Saw the alamo, didn't have a basement, like someone told me to find...haha funny. we ate lunch at joe's crab shack, and were trying to sell seth's ticket to the championship game. It eventually went for $200, not bad.  Drew and Frank sold thier tickets once we were inside for $150 a piece for (still first level) higher up seats. completely worth it, i guess.  the game was depressing, possibly worse refed than the Duke/Uconn game.  but ehh? i didn't really care anymore, i just wanted to go home. after the game we drove back to san antonio, packed and 

Jake's mom drove us back to Houston to catch our 5:40am, $99 flight tuesday morning.  We left the house at 1:30am.  I didn't really sleep in the car, and i definately didn't sleep on the flight.  Jake's mom gave us chocolate for easter before we left, she was really so sweet to us. We got into RDU around 10:40am.

and i'll never forget what frank said when we were waiting outside for Rob to come and pick us up at the airport, i said, ""i want to sit in the front, i haven't sat in the front this entire trip,"" frank laughed, he said ""there's no title nine on this trip, not when three guys are all over six foot."" lol, i guess he was right, not one of them offered to help me with my bags or anything ever, and i kind of appreciated it, not being treated differently.

i got back and slept, woke up around 5-ish i guess, went to dinner and studied physics like mad woah.

physics test on wednesday...eh? it went ok, i guess.

last night was holy thursday, went to my favorite mass of the year, saw matt, sat with sally, went home and crammed for math.
math test today?  eh?  i hadn't been to class in two weeks, caught up in shit and stuff, so it went ok i guess.  i need to pull myself together for another 2 weeks and then i'll be home for the summer to take orgo.  
the first time home in 4 months. wow i miss my family."

"event","after a long week of bid nights, late nights, a 3 hour long silent film on the KKK, and my first days back to work, i am more tired than i expected, but surprizingly not asleep yet, so i thought i would write.

meredith and i finished watching ""an affair to remember"", finally, after falling asleep the first time we tried to watch half of it.

hmm, what else. work was fun today, not much to do for 4 hours, but we're thinking of rearranging the furiture in the office, so i (dorky engineer that i am), made a to scale drawing, with furniture, so we could move it around and see what might work.  Susan was thrilled, Judy and Peter, impressed. i was happy because it gave me something to do when Susan was at lunch and i had already read half of ""Science."" 
home again, with not much to do. ordered from graces with sam, decided that i might stay in tonight. who knows, its only 8 or so, i have a mixer tomorrow night with AEII and Pippen tickets on sunday. long weekend."

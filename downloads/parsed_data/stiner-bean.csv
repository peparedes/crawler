"event","YO! My homies, Hizzle izzle yizzle? Alright I'll quit with the gangsta stuff. Sorry I haven't been at school. I had to go to a funeral and a visitation, for my Grandma Rosie who was killed in a car accident in Kansas by a drunk driver. I was going to come to school but my Step Dad said I couldn't and shouldn't go because of the issue. I was supossed to have a doctors appointment on Tuesday but that didn't happen because I had no ride. Plus my Step Dad (which is the only father I have ever known, b/c I have never met my biological father...) anyways Him and my Mom have been together all my life and they are splitting up, I am upset even tho you all have heard me talk bad about him and I do regret it, but it upsets me that I think about it. So I hope Tuesday that I can go talk to my counselor to see if I can make up my finals and what-not.  The funeral was upsetting. My grandma's second husband Dave (who was with her in Kansas at the time of the accident) well nobody likes him and he just wanted my grandma's money and made her go broke by stealing her money. Rosie was a great person she loved evryone. She had a kind heart and personally I have never met such a kind person. So she loved this aweful man, and They went to Kansas to pick up another car, so they were driving seperate cars. It was raing that night and noone could hardly see anything, they were on the highway coming back home to Springfield and two cars passed this Semi truck then she proceeded to pass him when the truck side swiped her. The person who wittnessed this said it lookied like an explosion had happened. The steering wheel had crushed her chest and thats how she died. Dave her husband then called the police here in town to notify us about the accident. My Step-Dad was supossed to contact Dave and go to Kansas to pick up her body and bring it back to Springfield. Dave then started playing these mind games on him saying that he'll do it and he'll pay for everything and let Fred (my stepdad)know when the funeral and what-not will take place. So my step-dad who was already feeling horrible, the worst feeling that anyone can endure. He was so upset. Then Dave called back and said for him to come and get her. He told Fred that he should just bring her back in a cardboard box. He was mortified, how can someone, who says they loved this woman think to do something that disrepectful. Fred and Dave argued about this issue. dave said that he'd pay for everything then decided he wanted to do it the cheapest way possible, he wanted to cremate her and scatter her ashes in the wind. Fred finally got custody of his mother and she had a beutiful casket. It was white and faded into a light pink, the handles were silver with roses on them. It matched her perfectly, she would have loved it. The interior of the casket was pink with embroided roses. The flowers the family had picked out were pink as well. She loved the colors pink and purple. In her house she had angles everywhere. My mom had a an Angel pin so I pinned it to her outfit to be burried with her. I miss her so much. My Step-Dad told Dave that he could come tho the funeral if he's give us her jewlry back so she can wear em. He never called or showed up with the Jewlry.... I never met anyone so heartless in my entire life. This man upsets me more that anything. I am just so happy that Rosie is in a place now where she is more happy than ever and that she is not with Dave anylonger. I hope this man gets whats coming to him and soon. My mom and everyone there at the funerla was saying how she always called me her daughter because all she was blessed with were boys and always wanted a little girl and that I was the closest thing to it. Her name was RoseAnne Gaddy formally known as RoseAnne Brooks. When she was born her brother came into the room (she was born at home) and he said that ""She's as beautiful as a rose."" and so they named her Rose. I will always remember her and will always be in my heart. There were 7 pink roses that were handed out to her two remaining sisters (she had 3 sisters and I think two brothers) her grandchildren (which includes me). I have that rose and I plan to dry it out and put it in a scrap book. There were four roses burried with her and one she was holding in her hands, The four represent the 4 grandchildren Sammual,Timothy,William,and Christina they had our names on them. I wont ever forget her, and how she looked when they burried her. On the night of the visitation when I looked at her I could swear she was breathing, I saw her chest move up and down, and her eyes moving behind her eyelids also that grin on her face. I thought I was hallusinating so I kept it to myself. The next day on the way back from Brighton Cemetary where she was burried, My stepdad mentioned how he thought she was moving last night and me and my mom both said thats we thought too And talked about how we all swore she was breathing and winking at us and smiling. I think she was letting us know that it's ok and she's in a better place now. That memory sticks with me and I'll never forget it.....

"event","Hello?
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now
I hear your feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain 
Get you on your feet again.
Relax.
I need some information.
Just the basic facts
can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding 
A distant ship smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I've got that feelin' once again 
I Can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am. 
I have become comfortably numb.

O.K.
Just a little pinprick.
There will be no more AHHHHHH
but you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good.
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.

There is no pain you are receding.
The distant ship, smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves. 
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child 
I caought a fleeting glimpse 
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone 
I can not put my finger on it now 
The child's grown,
The dream is gone. 
I have become comfortably numb."

<b>Summary:</b> Jamie has been on the same antidepressant since he was 16. Now that his psychiatrist has decided he doesn't need it anymore, he is rather startled to realise (with the departure of the side effects) that he is not, in fact, asexual. At all.

<lj-cut text=""open up your eyes now, tell me what you see / it is no surprise now, what you see is me"">My inspiration was a couple of lines of Beatles lyrics...
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open up your eyes now, tell me what you see 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is no surprise now, what you see is me</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~[The Beatles - <b>Tell Me What You See</b>]


As to the origin of the title...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>and the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happily have to disagree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laugh more often now / I cry more often now 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more me</i>

Jamie woke as usual to the sound of a ship's bell ringing, and squinted about, orienting himself, before attempting to shut off his alarm clock.  His fingers finally found the right button without much help from his eyes and switched off the recording.  

He grimaced at the covered window, at a stinging slice of light that had found its way past the heavy curtains, and reached to try to arrange them but only managed to upset them more.  Shielding his eyes from the sunshine with one arm, he slid out of bed and made his way to the dresser to find something to wear.  Then to the shower, silently, as usual.

He dried off and got dressed in the washroom as he always did, then opened the medicine cabinet and picked up the lone orange pill bottle on the shelf.  He looked at it for a long moment, studying the label, and gave it a shake.  No rattle.  He had taken the last one the morning before, but had not been able to bring himself to throw it away yet.  Jamie could not actually remember the last time he hadn't owned one of these, although intellectually he knew it had begun when he was sixteen.  It had been such an easy rhythm after the first few years, with refills every three months and no gap between.  He'd come to think of the bottle as something at least as permanent as a shoe or a fork, something that felt strange to get rid of despite its current uselessness.  Now and for the foreseeable future - or so said the powers that be - Jamie didn't need those pills anymore.

He uncapped the bottle, recapped it, and placed it back on the shelf in its proper spot.  Maybe he'd keep this part of his routine for a little longer.  Just in case everything else fell apart.


:~:


All he knew was that they should be kissing.  He didn't recognise his lover, but he didn't stop the inevitable touch, his trousers being shoved down or what happened after - no, he <i>had</i> to do this.  It was all that mattered.

They kissed again, or still, and he felt hot-mouthed bites to his lip, jaw, neck...  Friction where he needed it, fierce hands that felt like no touch he could ever give himself.  He was chasing something, straining towards it with everything he was, drenched with sweat, surrounded by another human body and being <i>loved</i>--

Jamie came, and woke, tensed and curling in on himself, still shuddering with pleasure.  When it had mostly passed he struggled to sit up, panting and gasping.  His pyjamas were soaked, and he had an inane moment of gratitude that the sheets had been spared.  He put one hand down the front of his boxers, squeezing himself, shocked at how <i>good</i> it felt.

As he tried to slow his breath, Jamie searched his memory for the last time he'd had a wet dream, but couldn't really recall.  He knew it had happened before, but not for several years.  He couldn't even remember the last time he'd had an orgasm, now that he considered it.  Sometime in the last few months, he thought - probably.  For the longest time it had seemed almost useless to touch himself, as he sometimes couldn't even make himself come, and he was never in the mood for it anyway.

He had thought himself a late bloomer when he was younger, but by the time he had turned twenty he was convinced that he would never bloom at all.  Sex was something that happened to other people, and Jamie didn't much care what he might be missing.  He had his own passions.  Since he was a teenager that had been enough.  But now...

It had been a little more than a week since he'd stopped the Paxil.  Aside from the bouts of tingling dizziness - mostly passed by now - nothing was different, not really.  Except<i> everything </i>was.  Like a crisper edge on the resolution of life; in the darkness of his room, Jamie felt weirdly dazzled.  To his utter astonishment he was getting hard again.  He wriggled out of his pyjama bottoms and gripped his cock, his mind reeling, skipping over the faces of friends and strangers, settling on blank physical sensation.  He shouldn't think of Geoff - and then he was ashamed for even internally voicing the idea of getting off to the image of his best friend.

He thought of nobody, and if it was ghost-Geoff's lips on his as he came, he wasn't about to admit it.


:~:


Jamie squirmed.  He fidgeted.  He took a sidelong look at his best friend, and made a tiny sound like a whimper.  Geoffrey set down his sandwich; he couldn't ignore Jamie's hijinks anymore.

""What on Earth's got into you today?  Ants in your pants?""

Jamie laughed.  ""Ants in your pants!""

""It's just an expression.  Don't change the subject.  Why do you keep squiggling around like that?""

""I don't really...  Well.  Suppose telling you might help get it out of my head.""

""Is everything all right?""

""Everything's better than it has been.  Dr. Chon took me off Paxil.""

""Geez, haven't you been on that for ten years or something?""

""Nine.  They decided to stop me taking it and see what happened.""

""That's just like them, isn't it.""

""But I'm happy!  Nine years... I thought there was something wrong with me.""

""A lot of people are depressed.  Doesn't mean they're defective.""

""No.  Not that.""

""Then what?""

Jamie slid down in his chair, drawing in his arms nervously.

""...You don't want to tell me?  You don't <i>have</i> to.""

""I should.""

Geoff waited, sipping his drink and watching with interest as the colour rose in Jamie's face.

""I used t' think.  Used t' think I was <i>asexual</i>.""

""Wow.  As in, not attracted to anybody?  Not even Scarlett Johanessen?""

""Not anybody.""

""Oho.  <i>Used</i> to think...  And now?""

""It was the Paxil.  It's been, I d'nno, suppressing something, I think?""

Geoff was grinning over his whole face.  ""And now, Jamie?""

""I'm pretty sure I'm not.  Asexual."" 

""Wowww.  Quite the revelation.  And now nine years of wild oats unsown all built up, is that it?""

Jamie pressed his lips together and looked down.  ""Worse.""

""What?  How do you mean?""

""I've... never...  That is.  'M a virgin,"" he muttered, barely audible.

Geoff was regarding Jamie with vast amusement, lips and eyebrows quirked; despite Jamie's habitual reticence on the subject, he wasn't surprised in the least.  ""Congratulations?""

""Not 'congratulations'!  I'm twenty-five!""  Jamie nearly shouted, then subsided, shocked at his own outburst.  ""I was supposed t' do all this in my teens.  I think.  But maybe...  Maybe I'd not've had anyone who wanted me even now, without the drugs.""

""I'm sure that's not true!""

""Are you?""  Jamie sounded as disturbed as Geoff had ever heard him, outside of things pertaining to his hobbies.  ""Are you really?""

""Yes.  I'm positive.  And I'll prove it to you.""

""How?""

""Get gussied up, Jamie m'lad.  I'm taking you out.""


:~:


""She just looked at you.  No, don't look.  Out of the corner of your eye, can you see?""

""No.  And how do you know she <i>looked</i> at me.  She could just be looking at me.""

""I know.  I always know it.  It's the bottom-to-top glance, that sort of, just there!  She did it again!  To me this time, but no worries.  You were clearly the primary target.""

""It's not a wargame.""

""Yes it is.  Now shush.  There!  That bird right across there.  You are a sharp-dressed man, after all.  You needn't be so shocked that people will look.""

""Packaging doesn't matter that much.""

""It makes quite a difference, though, on first impressions.""

""Not to me."" 

""Well.  Hang about.  Don't look, but that bloke just eyed you!  You could pull from either side, looks like.""

""I hardly think there's evidence--""

""Don't look, I said, c'mon!""

""I wanted to.""

""Oh...""

""Geoff?""

""What?""

""<i>You</i> just looked at me.""

Geoff sputtered a bit.

""The way the others did.  No different.""

""So what if I did.""  Geoff crossed his arms and looked away, scanning the crowd.  ""I was just <i>assessing</i>.""

""Why?""

""'S'not important.  Anyway, come on.""


:~:


Geoff was still on the alert for anyone who might be checking Jamie out as they sat across from each other in a tiny, cramped booth in the best Chinese restaurant in town.

""It's a bit pointless, though,"" Jamie said thoughtfully through a mouthful of lo mein.  He had found their people-watching excursion less painful than anticipated, but still wide of his idea of a good time.  

""Of course it's not!  I think I have proved my point: people look at you.  Even if you never noticed, they do.  Any girl with taste...""

""But I'm not out by myself.  They'd have no reason to approach.""

Geoff shifted around in his seat.  ""Not like you were trying t' pick up somebody.  Anyway, girls don't mind chatting up a bloke while he's with his mates.""  He grinned, adopting a teasing tone.  ""The only ones who might think you were taken 'd be other blokes, seems like.  Sorry, was I cramping your style?""

Jamie looked back at him, inscrutable and unlaughing - although the corners of his mouth were turned up slightly - and Geoff's face heated.

""Didn't mean t' seriously imply,"" he started, but Jamie interrupted gently.

""You should know it's not important to me.""

""What?""

""<i>What</i> someone is.  Only who.""

Geoff stared down at the cluster of crab rangoons on his plate, then back at Jamie.  ""Jam'e?  Are you bi?""

Jamie blinked, watching Geoff's mouth as he spoke, then his own hands as he thought it over carefully.  ""I don't know,"" he said.  ""I think... probably I am."" 

After several moment of stillness Jamie's face creased in an irrepressible grin, an expression Geoff couldn't help mirroring.  ""Look at you,"" he said quietly.  ""You're so happy.""

Jamie glanced off to the side, then down again, and nodded, beaming, <i>beaming</i>.

""Am I the first person you've told?""

""Aye,"" Jamie said, darting a look at Geoff, mischief in his eyes.  ""Nosy.""

""Don't give me that!  You were dying to say something!  Besides, I have to be inquisitive.  Contractual obligation or somesuch.""

""So why didn't you know before, detective?""

""What!""  Comically outraged, Geoff was barely holding in laughter.  ""<i>You</i> didn't even know!  How the fuck was I supposed to?""

""Unobservant.  You'll have t' turn in your P. I. license.""

They continued this way for some time - all in all, one of Jamie's more successful windups - until the fortune cookies arrived, at which point Geoff intoned that today was a metaphysically significant day and Jamie's fortune would predict his near future, with ""in bed"" tacked on to the end.  In fact, the little slip of paper read <i>your present plants will succeed</i>, and when the hilarity had died down Jamie told Geoff to thank the stars and Mrs. Wainthropp that he wasn't employed as a psychic.


:~:


Jamie considered saying that there was no need to walk him home, but quickly rethought turning down the company of his favourite person.

At the door, Geoff waffled oddly over whether to come in.  ""I just know if I set foot in there your Playstation is going t' eat my brain or something.  I have work in the morning.  I really should get home."" 

""You can go to work as easily from here.  You said my sofa's comfortable.""

""It is.""  Geoff scratched his head and sighed.  ""I guess I will head back, though.  See you tomorrow?""

Jamie smiled.  ""Tomorrow.""  He watched Geoff linger, thought of all the awkward lovers in movies standing in each others' doorways, thought, <i>Was this a date?  But he's straight - at least mostly.  Probably.  Oh, kiss him, kiss him kisshimkisshim... no.  Not yet.  (Kiss him!)  Straight.  Not yet.</i>

Geoff cast a look back over his shoulder as he left, and Jamie hung on the door frame and waved.

He managed to wait until he was in his pyjamas with all the lights out before he shut his eyes and slid his hand into his boxers, but this time he couldn't fool himself as to the subject of his fantasies.


:~:


Jamie opened his eyes, lazily curious as to why his alarm hadn't gone off.  Not that he had anywhere to be; his three-hour shift at the library wasn't until late afternoon.  He propped up on one elbow and peered at the dim clock face.  It showed thirteen minutes until his habitual waking, but, feeling unusually alert, he shut off the alarm and got up.  He raided his dresser and wandered out to have his shower, a short walk in his tiny flat.

When he was clean and dressed, he opened the medicine cabinet, picked up the empty pill bottle, and tossed it in the bin without a second's hesitation.

Then he headed out to his computer to email Geoff.  

He had better rituals to begin.

<lj-cut text=""''Sirius is in the Big Dog constellation?''"">~:


""...Sirius,"" the word flashed like a beacon for Harry's attention, focussing him instantly.  Hermione was saying something, he was vaguely aware, about their astronomy class for the coming year, and had been doing so for some time.  ""What, you didn't know it was the name of a star, too?  Here, see this map, in the constellation Canis Majoris--"" 

""<i>Canis Majoris</i>?  Canis as in canine?  Sirius is in the <i>Big Dog</i> constellation?"" 

""And another name for it is the Dog Star.  You needn't sound so disbelieving, Harry.  It makes sense, doesn't it?"" 

""But how could his parents possibly know he'd turn out to be a dog animagus?"" 

""Maybe he grew into his name, and just sort of got doggier and doggier..."" 

""'Doggier,' you say?  Is somebody talking about me?"" came Sirius's amused voice.  Harry dropped the textbook, which Hermione caught smoothly and began flipping through the pages to recover her lost place. 

""It's nothing bad, Sirius.  We were just talking about your name star.""  She showed him the diagram, and Sirius smiled.  There was an edge to it, Harry thought, but it made his strained look lighten for at least a moment, dissolving into bright affection. 

""It's not just an ordinary star, though,"" he informed them, still glinting.  ""It's binary - there's two stars to it, that orbit each other so closely that nobody could even tell there were two except that they tend to wobble around in the sky.  On top of that, it's usually the brightest star...  Pick your jaw up off the floor, Hermione.  My name star, remember?  Nobody would be shocked if you knew your name's origins."" 

""...<i>Winter's Tale</i>,"" mumbled Hermione, actually abashed. 

""Are they both called Sirius?""  This query being met by blank looks, Harry amended, ""the stars, the ones orbiting each other?"" 

""I guess so,"" replied Sirius thoughtfully.  ""But if the big one is the Dog Star, do you know what the little one's called?"" 

""It must be something like... the Wolf Star?"" ventured Hermione, who had not quite finished the textbook yet. 

""Good try, but no.  Five points from Gryffindor.  Kidding!  I'm kidding,"" he nearly shouted, recoiling when he saw Hermione's expression. 

""What is it called?"" Harry pressed curiously. 

Sirius met Harry's eyes warmly, reaching out to ruffle his already unruly hair.  ""The Pup.""

<lj-cut text=""epilogue"">:~:


Elijah is the one who catches them cuddling, the first time.  The face he makes is even better than they could have predicted.

""What the fuck, now?  How can you be..?  Dom?  Aren't you allergic?  Should I get a bucket for when your skin starts sloughing off, or what?""

""Good news, Doodle,"" Billy tells him, with radiant calm.  ""Apparently there's an exception.""

""Yeah, turns out Billy's not human.""  Dom beams through his nervousness, steady at the level of a dialed-down coming out.

Elijah looks startled, then sputters with laughter.  ""Should have known.  Man, I wish I had a camera.  Sean's gonna lose his shit.""

""You'll have plenty of opportunities to get blackmail photos, I'm sure.  Not that they'll help you any.""

""I know.  Everybody already knows Billy's gay for you, Sblommie.""

""Was there ever any doubt?""  Billy sounds proud, and Dom pushes past his burst of fear by kissing Billy's cheek, loud and wet.  Dom has a doubt.  People in love don't get so casual about things unless everything has already been said.  Dom has a great many doubts yet.

Except that Billy does him one better: he gets Dom by the jaw and kisses him directly on the mouth.  Past the numbing shock his touch is electric - pure pleasure on the place that's been wanting it most.  Now would be the optimal time to put on a show of not liking it, if Dom were able.  Instead Dom responds, hesitantly, still at the level where he can laugh it off if need be.  

""Whoa, c'mon guys, I get it!  You can stop now.""  

That's their cue to cut, but it's not happening.  Billy makes a soft laugh through his nose, and twists to kiss Dom a bit more businesslike.  Dom surprises himself by needing contact, pulling Billy closer against him.  He's beginning to dread the impending distance, bringing awkwardness as it must.  Finally they have to stop (or suffocate), and Billy's tongue-tip returns to its own mouth and Dom's fingers unclench from Billy's collar, and everyone is quiet for once.

""My place for supper?""  Billy's voice is warm and satisfied.

""Yeah, all right,"" says Dom.

Jamie dropped his stack of books heavily on the table, looking down at Maurycy's inquisitive face.  ""You, little thing.  You're a lot o' trouble,"" he said, affection betraying his mock-annoyance.  He settled into his chair with the top book of the stack, <u>Animals In Translation</u>.  Maurycy squeaked and popped up into his lap unconcernedly, curling up to snooze as Jamie read.  

They didn't spend long like this, though, before Geoff came struggling though the front door with too many carrier bags.  Jamie set the kitten on the floor out of the way and went to help Geoff, scolding him gently for carrying too much at once. 

""Oh, more kitten research?""  Geoff came over to check out Jamie's books when they had the groceries put away.  ""I don't think you really need it.  You're a good kitten dad.""

""I'm just not sure.  I want to do things right.  Besides, this stuff is interesting.""

They both watched Maurycy as she darted back and forth, under the sofa and out again, rolling as she tackled invisible enemies.  ""Weird little creature.""

""That is apparently normal,"" Jamie informed him, and they grinned at each other at the idea that anyone in their house <i>was</i>.  Geoff found a bit of string to dangle for Maurycy, Jamie curled up on the sofa to read, and the evening passed much like any other.

""Heels down, remember?""

Dom readjusted his posture, cursing the long long list of things he was supposed to be keeping in mind and the mind that refused to keep them. His horse lowered her head to crop at the grass, eyeing him insolently.

""No! She might choke with that bit in, pull her head up..."" Billy guided his own horse, a liver chestnut, to an easy halt and swung down. He patted her neck affectionately as he tethered her to the fence, then turned to assess Dom's predicament. ""Hands off the pommel. Put 'em up here, by the neck. No, lower yet. There. And flip the reins on the left, ye're holding 'em backwards. And... Ach. Just scoot up.""

Before Dom could process any of this, Billy was seated snugly behind him in the saddle. Billy made some kind of clicking noise with his teeth, and they were moving again, the horse acting as though she had never been plotting Dom's demise at all. He shook his head, amazed at having been shown up so thoroughly by his new friend. ""Thanks, mate. I was wondering, though. Didn't you mention you were afraid of heights? Isn't this just another kind of heights?""

""More like,"" Billy said, in a voice that made the back of Dom's neck prickle most pleasantly, ""just another kind of symbiosis.""

<lj-cut text=""On the table in the morning there were flowers."">:~:


On the table in the morning there were flowers.

Geoff wasn't sure how Jamie had managed it, but it had to have been Jamie.  He was here, after all - although he didn't seem to be right at the moment, and it was unusual for him to get up so early.

Not that Geoff could claim to know Jamie's habits anymore.  He had been away for months now, withdrawn from uni and backed out of their lease to go back to his little room at the top of the Holmes Inn and do whatever it is that he does, on his own.  He'd been in bad shape when he left; horribly down - hardly functional, really.  Nothing Geoff had done to help had been enough in the end, and he truly wondered if he'd seen the last of his friend, retreating back to solitude as he was.  But now Jamie was here, in Geoff's new flat, inexplicable as always.  He'd come for his visit late yesterday, and startled Geoff by hugging the breath out of him as soon as he was in reach.  They had a week to spend together.  It looked as though Jamie intended to fill it with the maximum of oddness. 

As to the manifestation of that oddness: well, it had happened once before.  Only once, some two months before Jamie left.  He had supposed it to be thanks for comforting Jamie after one of his night terrors.  Those flowers had been on the table when he'd returned from class the next day, bound with a bit of twine same as these.  These were types he recognised, though; the other ones, although vaguely familiar, he had not had names to put to.  He had, however, made note of them in his journal at the time, which shouldn't be too hard to locate.  

Geoff dug that up out of his things in only a few minutes, and laid it open next to the new bouquet to compare.  Same twine.  Same pattern, really: two types of flowers and a little branch of leaves.  The note beside a rough sketch of the previous boquet of unnamed flowers reminded him that he had thanked Jamie that evening, but Jamie had just blinked at him.

If he thought of this phenomenon as a case, it had never been closed, and was certainly live now.  So... current notebook, pen, his new digital camera - check.  He recorded the new bouquet with a brief sketch to scale, a photo, and a list of the contents, since he recognised the flowers at least.  Three stalks of purple hyacinth were bound to a single stem of geranium, accompanied by greenery of some sort.  He outlined its leaf in his notebook, ran a copy of the old bouquet's page and stapled it in, and put his fresh flowers in a glass of water on the windowsill.  

Geoff went over his investigatory options.  Jamie hadn't answered his direct approach last time, so there was no reason to think he would this time.  In fact, this felt distinctly like some sort of game.  Since Jamie was out, he could nip over to the library and get a flower identification guide in an hour or less without being obvious about it.  

Geoff was halfway to the library on his motorbike when a sign for cut flowers caught his eye.  He turned around and pulled in, looking curiously through the windows.  The place was open, and upon entering he found it very full of plants, so much so that any till or workstation there might be was hidden at first.  But rounding a potted shrubbery, he located a window with a bit of counter at the bottom, and a silver bell sitting out.  He rang it once, and waited.

Presently a short, dark woman who looked to be somewhere in her fifties appeared, gloved and muddy.  She stuck her face out the little aperture.  ""Can I help ye?""

""Er, I hope so,"" said Geoff.  ""I was given some flowers, and I'm not sure what they are.  Might you be able to identify them?""

""Let's have a look, then.""

Geoff set his notes on the counter, and was relieved when she didn't pick them up, just leaned over, squinting at them.  ""Heh.  Not a bad little doodle, there.  I think I can tell ye.  This,"" she pointed to the first bouquet, ""is milk vetch.  Tied with thornapple, and of course that's a fern.  And the other, well...  Looks like you know what hyacinth is, that's good.  Geranium, aye.  The greens are wormwood, by this leaf you've drawn.""  She looked up.  ""Will that be all?""

""Well.""  Geoff pressed his lips together thoughtfully.  ""I'm also not too sure... should I give flowers in return?  I just don't know the etiquette of it.""

""Eh, lad.  I couldn't swear t' this, but it looks as though with this one here,"" she gestured to that morning's flowers, ""Somebody's trying to apologise t' you.""

""Really?  How can you tell?""

""In the language o' the flowers, hyacinth of this colour means <i>forgive me</i>, unless I'm much mistaken.  Purple, correct?""

""Yes.  Language of the flowers?  You mean like a red rose means love and a yellow one means just friends?""

""Close enough.  'Twas a Victorian practise, revelling in their repression and all that.  I'd say giving flowers back is up t' you, now, but ye'd best tell her if she's forgiven.""

""Erm.  Okay...""

""Do you want to give something?  If you want to say back that it's alright - or that it's not - I can put you something together.""

""I suppose... yes.  I would like to try.  It's a kind of a code, isn't it.""

""It certainly is!  Now.  What are you wanting to say?""

""That it's alright.  That there's nothing to apologise for.  Can you do that?""

""Of course we can!  Let me get my book down.""

A quarter-hour later, Geoff was riding home with a carefully shielded little clutch of flowers: white jasmine with apple blossoms and a sprig of white ivy tendrils, which disappeared from the table that afternoon after Jamie came back to the flat.

Jamie and Geoff had lunch.  They played video games.  They had a walk out to the river, and a nap in the den, and a late dinner of cold pizza.  Geoff tried not to think about the flowers.  He tried not to hope there would be more tomorrow.


:~:


Geoff burst into the shop, stuck his head through the little window, and called, ""What does a pink rose mean!""

""All right, hold yer horses,"" said the proprietress, coming out of the greenhouse.  ""What, now?""

""A pink rose!  There's a pink rose here, what does it mean?""

""Oh, you brought it this time.  And freesia!  That's a pleasant little workup.  Let me get the book down, lad, and we'll check it out for ye.""

Geoff tried not to squirm while she was paging through the book, or snap when she looked up freesia first.

""Says here freesia could mean innocence or trust.  That's sweet.  All is forgiven, then?""

""Sure, whatever, and the rose?""

""Pink rose, pink rose...  Here it is.  Rose, pink.  Could mean any of the following: <i>perfect happiness, secret love, grace and sweetness, indecision</i>.  Sounding familiar to you?""

Geoff was completely befuddled.  ""Well...  Indecision, maybe?  But what does that <b>mean</b>?""

She smiled a little.  ""Are you sure she mightn't mean secret love?  Or she may be perfectly happy the way it is now.""

""Well.  I don't... I have no idea.  I suppose.  Well.  I want to answer, 'cause I don't think I'll get any more flowers unless I give more, but...""

""What to say?  Well, I can help y' out, if ye like.""

""Yes.  Please.  Thank you for all your help so far, too.""

""Oh, it's not a trouble!  Just promise you'll tell me how it all turns out!""

""If you like.  I don't think it's going to be anything special, really.""  Geoff smiled, distinctly reminded of Hetty.

She shrugged.  ""My interest is piqued, is all.  Now, what're the qualities of our mysterious flower-giver, do you know?""

""Yeah.  Let's see.  Very innocent and intelligent.  A loyal friend, with many talents.  Recently quite ill.""

""I'm sorry t' hear that.  Hmm.  What would you judge her best feature to be?""

""Physical feature?""  Geoff nibbled on a bit of the spearmint leaf bound into his bouquet.  ""Eyes, probably.  Or hands.""

""I think azalea, for <i>taking care</i>.  And dogwood blossom.  And some cedar ornament, that would be lovely if you prefer to keep to the pattern of a group of three.""

""Um, all right.""

""Seven pounds, please,"" she said, binding the flowers with a white ribbon.  Geoff blinked numbly and handed over the cash.


:~:


""Hello?""

""I'm right here, no need to shout.  And the name's Marcie, not 'hey you'.""

""Marcie.  I'm Geoff.""

""I know.  Saw yer notebook.  Got another bit of code for us today?""

""Yeah...""

""You don't seem so excited.  Something going wrong?""

""Just.  Well, have a look.""

Marcie picked up the note attached to today's bouquet.  ""<i>I think we're using different books. -J</i>.  Ah, some sort of misunderstanding?""

""I don't know if I should keep doing this.  I haven't a clue what kind of messages I'm sending, not really.""

""What have we got, there, a daffodil, and...  I'm not sure I know this one.  Let me get my identifier.""

Geoff waited uncomfortably while she shuffled her papers about, and eventually was rewarded with a glossy photo in her identifier of his same flowers, growing wild.

""That's love-in-a-mist.""  She flipped to the L section in the flower language handbook.  And it means, <i>you puzzle me</i>.""

""Oh.""

""Don't be so downcast, boy!  Let's look at the daffodil, then we can see what our greenery means.""

""You mean, the greens have meanings, too?""

""Oh, yes!  Just a moment.  Hm.  Daffodil.""  She glanced up at his face before continuing.  ""Means <i>the sun shines when I'm with you</i>.  Or it could have the connotation of <i>unrequited love</i>...  My.  Is it her love that's unrequited?""  She asked gently.  ""Or yours?""

""I... don't know.  I really don't know.""

""Mmkay, let's see here.""  She sniffed at the sleek greens, and her eyes widened.  ""Lemon grass?""  She flipped a few pages, and looked at the book owlishly, but didn't show Geoff.  ""Ah, well, isn't that something else.""

""What?""

Marcie raised her eyebrows at him.  ""Just tell me if I'm right: it's not a lass at all.  It's a lad, giving you these flowers.""

""Uhhhhhh.""  Geoff felt his cheeks heating up at being so blatantly caught out.  He rubbed his face, grimacing.  ""How can you know that?""

""So!  It was either that 'J' was a lad, or that she didn't fancy you after all.  Seeing as lemon grass means - well, have a look.""  She turned it around for him and pointed to the words <i>homosexual love</i>.

""Ahahah.  Er.""

""No need t' be bashful about it, boy.  Let's get this sorted, shall we?  Pull those crates over here and have a seat.""

Geoff did, and pulled himself together while he was at it.  ""I don't know how to verify if we're using the same book except asking outright, which seems to be off limits.  Maybe if we go through from the beginning and list the meanings of everything, this will make more sense.""

""It's worth a go.  This is the only book of it I've got, but.  Maybe the library?""

""I don't know, I can look.  In the meantime, though.  Okay.""  He tore a fresh sheet out of his notebook to make a table, then flipped back to the page with the earliest flowers.  ""First... thornapple, milk vetch, and fern?  That must've been six months ago.""

Marcie flipped through her book.  ""Thornapple.  Means, <i>I dreamed of thee</i>.  That's lovely.""

Geoff recorded that in the table.  ""Makes sense, too.  He was having nightmares.""  He shrugged when she wrinkled her brow at that.

""What was the next?""

""Milk vetch.  Then fern.""

""Milk vetch means: <i>Your presence softens my pain</i>.""  She didn't comment, but it was pretty clear she was forming the idea of a tragic, romantic prince-type character (though such a generalisation could hardly do Jamie justice, to Geoff's way of thinking).  ""And fern?  <i>Magic, fascination, confidence, shelter</i>.  Any or all of those.""

""Thank you,"" Geoff said, scribbling to keep up.

""Not a problem.  Now, the second batch was hyacinth, wasn't it?""

""Yeah, and geranium, and wormwood.""

""Purple hyacinth... <i>sorry, please forgive me,</i> or <i>sorrow</i>.  Geranium....  Don't look so tormented, it'll be alright.""

""When he got ill, he had to stop uni and move back to his hometown.  Left me with a two-person flat to look after and some of his things to remind me that my best friend had bailed on me.  I said some things then I never should have said.""

""But you've forgiven him that now, and he's certainly forgiven you, considering he leaves you flowers every day!  Best not to dwell on what can't be changed.""

Geoff sighed.  ""Right.  Er, geraniums?""

""<i>True friend, stupidity, folly</i>.  On a similar track.""

""Yep.  And wormwood?""

""<i>Absence. Do not be discouraged</i>.  See?  He's missing you, the poor thing.""

""Not at the moment, he's not.  He's taking up my sofa this week.  So, what about the ones I gave him in return?  Apple blossom..?""

""That one was <i>better things to come</i>, if I recall.""  Marcie flipped the pages some more.  ""Oh, and also <i>preference</i>.""

""Preference?""

""Aye.  What was next?""

""What does 'preference' even mean?""

""I couldn't say.  Now, what was next?""

Geoff scowled.  ""White jasmine.  This is kind of important to me, you know?  I can't believe I gave him those flowers when even you don't know what they mean.  How could he possibly get a message from that?""

""Let it go for now.""  She paused, staring at the book, then sighed.  ""All right, today's flowers are on the house.""

He blinked.  ""Oh.  Well, thank you.""

""Moving along!  Jasmine, of the white variety, means <i>amiability</i>.  That's the 'it's alright' in that bunch.""

""Okay.  And the white ivy thing?""

""<i>Affection, anxious to please</i>.  Because you <b>were</b>.""

""Fair enough.  Onto the next.  Freesia was <i>innocence</i> and <i>trust</i>, I remember.  And a pink rose was <i>secret love</i> and <i>indecision</i>..?""

""<i>Perfect happiness, secret love, grace and sweetness, indecision.</i>""

""And spearmint?""

""<i>Warm sentiment</i>.""

""'Kay.  Man, I didn't even ask what I was giving him this next time.  Serves me right.  Azalea?""

""That one would be taking care... no, <i>take care, temperance, fragile, passion.</i>""

Geoff just shook his head.  ""Then dogwood and cedar.""

""Cedar means <i>think of me</i> or <i>I live but for thee</i>.""  She overrode his muttering to say, ""and dogwood means, <i>am I indifferent to you?</i>""

""Fortunately for all concerned, I'm <b>not</b> indifferent.  But who knows what he got from that?""

""Ehm, on to today's?""

""Yeah.  Love-in-a-mist... wait, I already wrote those down up here.  <i>You puzzle me</i> and all that.""

""Ah, yes.  So.  What would you like to say in today's message?""

""...Let me see that book.""


:~:


At the sound of the latch, Jamie started and dropped the flower, then caught it again before it could even hit the table.

""Sorry, didn't mean to sneak up.  Well, maybe just a little,"" Geoff grinned at him.

""You broke the pattern.""

""I know.""

""<b>Two ways</b> you broke the pattern.  Two plants instead of three.  Is this the last of it, then?""

""Maybe,"" Geoff said.  He moved to the sink and drew a glass of water.  ""Want to put those in here?""  When Jamie shook his head, Geoff downed the water himself.

""This one, I know this one.  'S a variegated tulip.  But.""  He turned the leafy bit of branch over in his hands.  ""I don't know what this is.""

Geoff swallowed a nervy flutter.  ""Jerusalem oak.  None too common around here.  I won't make you look it up.  Means, well, it means.  Means, <i>your love is reciprocated</i>.""

""--reciprocated,"" Jamie spoke the final word in time with Geoff, who looked at him curiously.  ""And the tulip means <i>beautiful eyes</i>.""

""You know them all by heart, don't you.""

""Aye.  That's what I do, Geoff.""  He stood there, staring down at his flower.  ""If we're not doing this anymore, I want to tell you: if I could, the next I'd give you would be hydrangea, lemon blossom, and, ehm.  Dill,"" he said, and actually blushed.

""You better believe I'll be looking those up.""

""And possibly a green rose,"" he said, suddenly smiling impishly.  ""Which means, <i>I am from Mars</i>.""

""Seriously?""  Geoff huffed a laugh.  ""Is there one that means 'I wouldn't have it any other way'?""

""Mm... winter daphane almost means that.""

Jamie took a step, so Geoff did, too.  They hesitated.  

""My contact at the flower shop would love to meet you.  I think she imagines you as some kind of fairy prince.""

Jamie stuck his nose in his tulip.  ""Was that after the lemon grass?""

""Yeah, but not <b>that</b> kind of fairy prince.  I'm talking about the last of the true romantics.""  Geoff leaned on a chair-back until it creaked, and watched Jamie stroking the petals of his flower, brushing it against his lips.  ""I should have been the one giving you purple hyacinths.  Is there a flower that could tell you that I never should have said the things I said to you?  I was so angry, so heartbroken, really, that you'd leave after having me promise not to.""

""Yarrow,"" Jamie whispered.

""I didn't mean those things, and I'm sorry.  I do get it, you know.  Why you had to go.  And I don't blame you.  I just hope you can come back someday, to stay.  Or I could go there.  And there's the internet, you know; we shouldn't just not talk.  I can't take that for four bloody months at a time.""

""Hydrangeas again for you.  <i>Thank you for understanding</i>.""

""Red roses, for you, Jamie.""

Just a tiny intake of breath, and Jamie was standing close, tipping his forehead down to rest against Geoff's shoulder.  Geoff's hand went out to touch his waist, and then they were in each other's arms.

<b>Notes:</b>  This story is for <lj user=light_the_sky76> ~ happy slightly belated birthday to you.  
Lightning-fast beta by <lj user=tigertale7>.


<lj-cut text=""''I knew the situation was getting dire, but now quite how dire.''"">~:


""I knew the situation was getting dire, but now quite how dire.  Look at you!  Do you have anything at all clean left?""

Jamie's brow furrowed, and he showed definite signs of digging in his heels.  ""Some things.  We don't need to go today.""

""Like hell we don't!  You never wear that kilt except as a last resort.  You know it, I know it--""

""And the American people know it, yes.  Your devious Saturday Night Live quoting ways are as sign language to the blind.  I'm in the middle of some downloads.""  With that, Jamie made himself scarce.

Geoff knuckled at a muscle knot in his temple.  He followed his flatmate into Jamie's room (never an ideal hiding place, but Jamie was a creature of habit).  Jamie parked himself at his desk and hunched his shoulders, calling to mind the noble porcupine.

A brief survey of Jamie's laundry basket confirmed the severity of the case.  The basket itself overflowed into piles on the floor, while every dresser drawer stood open and empty.  Some of the humour of it seemed to fade when Geoff realised he'd never seen Jamie's room so messed up.  His friend must have hit a less than stellar mental state to allow it to get this disorganised.

""Looks a little overwhelming,"" Geoff ventured, hoping Jamie wouldn't get defensive about it.  No response.  Of course it was overwhelming.  ""There's no reason not to do it today.  You're free, I'm free, and I've a load or so to put in anyway...""  Jamie muttered something, but made no move to get up.  ""Listen, just.  How about this - if you help me, I'll help you.""

""Help you with what?""

""Your laundry.""

Jamie threw him a puzzled glance.  ""Then, help me with what?""

""Um, your laundry.""

""Working together on it.  Why didn't you just say that?""  Jamie eyed his laundry pile and grimaced, seeming pushed on by gravity rather more than usual.  ""I'd prefer not to, but.  Waiting 'till tomorrow 'd mean wearing my suit, or something dirty, and neither of those really work for me.""


:~:


At the laundrette, Geoff began to find reasons behind Jamie's hesitation.  The lights were fluorescent and flickery, and the sound of the machines incessant.  If Geoff could smell five different kinds of soap behind the scent of stale cigarettes, Jamie was getting clobbered by it.  Treating the place like a war zone seemed logical - no exacting sorting methods, just dumping the clothes into five adjacent washers, adding detergent and coins, then a cut-and-run maneuver.  Geoff went back in to start his own load, but soon enough was back to sit on the kerb beside Jamie.

""You really hate this place, don't you.""

""Aye.""

""The sounds, most?  Or the smells?""

Jamie shrugged, squinting in the glaring sun.  ""Carrying so much isn't too good.  I always, always drop things.  Though the cardboard box was a good idea.  Asking strangers to make change for me, echh.  Putting my clothes where everybody's been touching.  And the floor in the back where it's sticky.""  Jamie got a chill.  He shook it off.  ""What I <i>hate</i> is an hour and a half in an unfamiliar building that costs money to assault my senses.""

""Then let's get out of here.""  Geoff stood, and offered a hand to Jamie.  

""Really?  Should we leave our things..?""

""Not for too long, but we can at least get a drink or something.""

""Where?""

""Anywhere.  Shall we?""

Jamie hesitated, steeled himself, and took the outstretched hand, levering himself up awkwardly.  He didn't return Geoff's grin, but seemed to relax marginally into the state of flux that was any big event outside the house.  He was batting dust off the hem of his kilt as Geoff unlocked the car.

""Why <i>don't</i> you wear that thing more often?  It's actually really nice.  Sort of suits you.""

Jamie made a face.  ""It prickles.""  A beat, then he glared at Geoff, who was smothering giggles, and said, ""I know what you're thinking, and I don't want to talk about it!""

""You're out of clean pants!  You're out of clean pants!  Jamie's going freeee!""

""I don't want to talk about it, I said!"" Jamie shouted, but he was laughing as he climbed into the car to cuff Geoff on the side of the head.  

It hadn't been easy to reach that laugh, but it was still possible, Geoff told himself, worries much relieved.

<lj-cut text=""''Are you Charlie Pace?''"">~:


""Are you Charlie Pace?""

Geoff blinked at the stranger addressing him, who was staring at him with an expression uncomfortably close to worship. ""...No. Who?""

""You. You look <i>just</i> like him. You're sure?""

""Sure that I'm not somebody else?"" Heh. ""Yes. Very Sure. Geoff Shawcross."" He put out his hand, attempting to salvage the situation, but the other lad only glanced at it. And resumed staring.

""Very sure,"" he repeated reluctantly.

Geoff supposed most people would be more discomfited at this point, but curiosity had already taken over, and he was finding the encounter oddly charming. He smiled and met the other's eyes, who looked away, flushing, then kept peeking back. ""Who are you?"" Geoff inquired gently.

""Jamie Holmes, good afternoon how are you I'm fine, thanks very much.""

... ""And who is it I look like?""

Jamie seemed to expand a little with held-in excitement. ""The bassist from DriveSHAFT. You look just like him, so much. Only your hair is different. He's my favourite,"" he added unnecessarily.

""Sorry to disappoint you.""

""Oh, no! Not a disappointment, this, not at all, I mean... I'm not at all sure I'd survive meeting him for real. Suspect my head would explode."" Geoff chuckled, and Jamie smiled a little and seemed to relax marginally. ""And you do look so like him. It's like meeting him, only without the brains everywhere.""

""And without the music."" Geoff was trying to remember what desperately overplayed song it was that DriveSHAFT had done, without success.

""And without the music,"" Jamie agreed. ""Or crowds or groupies to fight off. Lucky, that.""

""I know, man, I've never been so glad not to be famous.""

""Just..."" Jamie fell silent, lifting his eyes to Geoff's face, taking him in. Geoff felt almost pinned by his gaze, not wanting to disturb the image he seemed to be saving. He wondered a bit awkwardly if Jamie was seeing him or that musician. At last he was released when Jamie looked away. The quiet had grown long and heavy; Geoff was about to try saying something - anything - to end the silence, when Jamie spoke again. ""So I know all about Charlie Pace, but he doesn't know me. And he has no reason to take the time to talk to me, even if I could... But."" He smiled, a sweet, impish grin. ""Neither does Geoff Shawcross have any reason, yet here you are.""

Geoff tilted his head, amused. ""True enough.""

""Which, to me, means..."" his forehead wrinkled, ""hold on a moment."" Jamie fumbled in his pockets, came up with a pen and a scrap of receipt, and scribbled something on the back. He looked up - ""it means, I think, that you might email me as well."" He thrust the piece of paper into Geoff's hand, ducked his head, and beat a determined retreat, scuttling hastily around the corner of a nearby storefront.

Geoff pondered pursuing him, but discarded that idea quickly. No point in freaking the guy out any further than he was already freaked. Which seemed a considerable amount. The paper in his hand contained a barely legible email address and a scrawl that was probably <i>Jamie</i>. He tucked it into his wallet, thinking that he might just use it after all. Now, back to his errand...

...Of which he had no memory whatsoever. Even logic and extrapolation couldn't jar loose the knowledge of what he was out here to do, not after that thorough of a distraction. He got his mobile out, preparing himself to be savagely teased by Hetty for this. 

In his head, he was already composing an email to Jamie about it.

<b>Notes:</b>  This story may make you hungry.  Or the opposite, if you don't like eggs.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Fiona Apple song of the same title.  Beta by <lj user=ali_jayne>.


<lj-cut text=""Can't forget to flip them."">:~


""What smells so fantastic?""  Geoff wanders in, half dressed.  I try to keep my mind on cooking, but have to turn and smile at him.  Can't forget to flip them.

""It's only eggs and toast.  Anything smells fantastic to you before breakfast.""  I can't forget to flip them.  The timing is delicate.  They'll burn.

He leans towards the range, inhaling.  ""<i>Mutant</i> eggs and toast, then.""  Geoff thinks it's funny that Asperger Syndrome (basically, me) is considered a mutation, and brings it up every chance he gets.  I think it's some sort of X-Men thing.  Well, Nightcrawler is cool.  Can't forget, can't forget.

""Never had much luck with the normal kind.  Yolks always break.  This is sort of a protein-carbohydrate boost.  My mum taught me.""  My eyes are trained on the edge of the bread.  Geoff sidles in for a kiss; it's just a greeting smooch, so I let him.  I can't take my attention away from breakfast, or it'll ruin.  I wave him off with the spatula.  It's hard to say whether the grumbling noise he makes on the way out to fetch the paper is his voice or his stomach.

I hope the neighbours enjoy the show.  He's forgot his trousers again.

The white parts are looking pretty well solidified.  I probably present the appearance of a bomb squad member attempting to defuse toast with an egg in the middle.  Flipping eggs is about all the drama I can take in the morning.  One, two, three, four...  each piece flops by turn into place on the pan, and without so much as a drip of yolk.  That's victory.

""They done yet?""

I don't bother to reply - me still hovering over them with my spatula ought to make it clear enough.  It's only about a minute, though, before I can bring down plates and deposit two slices onto each.  Geoff is at my elbow, and accepts his plate before I quite get it to the table.

""These are definitely weird,"" he says happily as we spread the yellow around atop white-infiltrated bread.  ""And delicious,"" he adds around a mouthful.  The white part of the egg is rightly known as albumen, but Geoff doesn't let me call it that while he's eating.  He gestures at his food with his fork.  ""Is there a name for them?""

""One-eyed sailors,"" I tell him, deadpan, and he nearly chokes laughing, then swats me with the Arts & Entertainment section.  It's particularly bulky on Tuesdays.

""No wonder you like them!""

""No wonder.""  I'm only halfway through my first piece, and he's well into his second.  Then again, he isn't bothering to dip the crust in the yolk.

I am suddenly so intensely happy that I interrupt his eating to give him a real kiss. 

""I feel really good today,"" I say by way of explanation.

""I can tell.""  It's not usual for me to be up to cooking by myself, especially early in the day.  It takes way too much RAM.  ""...I was really hungry today,"" he adds a bit piteously, and he's setting himself up for it now.

""Aye, and the sun came up, too.  But if you want another one-eyed sailor, you'd better be making it yourself.""  And then we're just grinning at each other like fools.

<b>One-Eyed Sailors</b>
(Very exacting directions suitable even for other non-cooks.)

What you need:
&nbsp; &nbsp; Slices of bread that are porus and not too small to soak up most of the egg-white.  Also, the crust shouldn't be taller than the bread itself, especially if the texture of the white gives you trouble.
&nbsp; &nbsp; One egg per slice.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Butter or whatever you prefer to use.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; A nice big pan of good temperament.
&nbsp; &nbsp; A spatula or other flipping device.
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fork.

Heat the pan until the butter will turn clear and bubble slightly on it.  Melt a little butter in the spot so that it'll kind of butter the bread as you lay it in.  Tear a hole out of the centre of your slice of bread that is only a wee bit bigger than you suspect the yolk will be.  Eat the middle bit, so you're not too hungry while cooking (the cook always eats last).  Lay the bread into the pan, then break an egg into the middle.  Lift up the bread a tiny bit so that the albumen can reach all the way under the bread, and spread what's not soaked in around evenly on the top with the fork.  Wait until you can tell the white in the centre is not going to be runny on the other side and the yolk is cooked into place enough to turn over without going everywhere, then flip it.  If you can, place it in a spot with a little more butter melted there.  You can flip it as many more times as you need if it didn't finish on the other side.  When the yolk looks nicely over-easy on both sides, it is ready to eat.

I'm fine with one or two slices, even when I'm hungry, but Geoff swears only three is enough for a proper meal.  Take into consideration that he is very pro-breakfast.  He also likes pepper on his.

Unfortunately, this is the only vaguely pirate-themed recipe I know.

<lj-cut text=""You rest your cheek on his.  You've been thinking."">~:


Stretch.

Stretchh.

Pause. ScribblescribblescribbleERASEscribblescribble. Pause.

Stretchhhh. This time his shirt rides up, and you look <s>away</s> carefully.

It's just skin.

Brushing eraser-dust onto the floor, nibling on the point of his pencil, and you know that next time he smiles there'll be traces of graphite on his teeth. You resolve to make him smile as soon as possible.

ScribblescribblescribblescribblescribblescribblescribblescribblescribbleSTRETCH, a serious stretch, edge of boxers displayed through the slot in the chair-back, and you are inordinately pleased that they are the ones you gave him last Christmas. No, two Christmasses ago.

Never mind what kind of mates give each other pants for Christmas. You gave him that journal, too, didn't you? And if you could turn the thermostat down just one more degree, maybe he'd need one of your jumpers, and--

Nuh <i>uh</i>. That's going a bit far.

But he's in your house. He's already surrounded by you. Only not literally.

How easy it suddenly is to move to remedy that.

Your arms slide around his shoulders from behind, and he does not start at your touch. He breathes deep before looking at you, and stretches that long neck backward, chin to the sky. Ceiling.

You rest your cheek on his. You've been thinking.

""Bored, Bills?"" It occurs that you were supposed to have been reading. A glance over your shoulder shows your book set pages-down and getting a bit rumpled. It would piss you off if you've lost your place, but that really isn't a priority right now, is it?

""Getting there.""

He lets his breath out through his nose like a yawn. His skin smells of... and here your mind fails, because there aren't enough good words for scent in the English language. Hmm. I'd say... brownish-gold.

You laugh, and he sits up and twists without shaking off your arms, so his can go around your waist, too, and suddenly you're a hundred times more okay than you were, and you hadn't even noticed if you weren't.

""D'you need me t' entertain you? Isn't that your job, host? What do you do when I'm not here?""

""Rot, mostly,"" you confess, and he laughs and you laugh and no, it isn't true, but it feels that way right now.

He pulls on your waist, then, hauling himself up out of the chair so that you almost fall, but of course you don't really. Then he's standing there with a vaugely puzzled, curious look. Like <i>should I try juggling, then, what?</i>

""Read to me,"" you say, with no preplanning, and. ""Well, maybe you've not read this, and I'm halfway through, but--""

""Alright."" He leans over (such unlikely angles to him sometimes) and snags the book, a finger where it was open as he flips through. ""What, no <u>Kissing In Manhattan</u>?""

Rats! That would have been an experience. ""Nawp, finished that one. Ehm, from here, then,"" you point out your place, not lost after all, and he grins and parks himself carelessly on the loveseat, one leg thrown over the armrest. His hair is ridiculous.

""Ha-h'm. <i>Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with authority.</i> Hey, I've read this!""

""Have you?"" You've settled beside him, not quite relaxed enough. You have the obdurate urge to read over his shoulder.

""Ages ago. This is classic! Why'd you take off the dust jacket? Oh, never mind, here goes: <i>'Life,' he said, 'is like a grapefruit.' 'Er, how so?' 'Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast.'</i> Ha!"" says Dom loudly, and you jump a little. ""You've never read this before? And you're almost to the good part, why'd you stop? This isn't a boring book, you know,"" he says with authority. ""It's insane.""

""I was..."" you trail off. Not much you can say, really. Well. ""I was at a good part.""

""You were at a good part,"" he repeats mildly, untroubled.

""Yeh. 'Cause."" And your hand tugs on the tail of his shirt a little, just kind of a pullpullpull that he'll hardly notice. Your knuckle bumps the soft skin of his side, and he writhes a little, in no position to escape, really, and looks at you.

And sighs, and smiles a little glowy smile. And leans over and lets the book slide off his lap, leans on you, and you didn't expect it but he's draped across your lap now, inhaling and exhaling like a monk trained to do it all day for the path to heaven. His arms are heavy, and it can't feel good, your knee digging into wherever it's digging.

Dom's weight settles on you, and if you were okay before, now you are... something way better. But you're not thinking too hard about it.

""Me too,"" he says, and you laugh, and kiss his nose, and just, sort of...

Yeah.

Spend the rest of the evening like that.

""No, Dominic, now, <b>that</b> is drag.  That's drag.""

""Hello to you, too.""

""Ah shut it.  As if you care about phone etiquette.""

""Got me again.  You got my email, then?  Digital cameras, they're --""

""Dom.  ...You okay?""

""...Yeah.  A little scared.""  

""Don' be scared.""

""I'm tryin'.""

""What is this, really?  And will y' finish what you were goin't' say in L.A., about what's drag?""

""I don't know.  I don't like being restricted, y' know?  There's things that're out of bounds, just 'cause I'm male -- Well.""

""Is that it?  That isn't Eddie Izzard talking, by any chance, is it?""

""...I don't know what it is, exactly.  Billy...  Please.""

""Hold it together, there.  You're <i>fine</i>, you are more than fine.  Disturbingly fine, even.""

""Puns are the lowest form of humour.""

""Appropriate, then, that we should be working so closely with them.  The paramecia of the joke world.  Do they divide and multiply as well?""

""NO!  No math jokes.  I'm okay.""

""That sounds almost true, at least.  Tell me?""

""What do you want t' know?""

""Tell me what drag is...""

""Oh.  Well.  Drag, I guess, drag is taking one way of dressing to an extreme.  It doesn't have to be crossdressing.""

""...That's not really drag, then, is it.  What you're wearing in the picture.  Are you still?""

""Yeah.""

""It's a nice skirt.  I have t' say, it looks sort of <b>normal</b> on you...  No offence.""

""C'mon, what am I taking offence at in --""

""I just called you <u>normal</u>.""

""Oh.  ...HOW DARE YOU!?!  Okay.  But.  I mean.  It feels pretty natural to extend what I normally wear to this, and that's part of what scares me.  And I keep thinking of going out like this, and I know people are gonna look if I do, and they look anyway, right, and I don't want to care what they're gonna think, but I want to <b>know</b>.  I'm trying to figure it out.  And I'm not really sure what I think, really.""

""<i>...Bloke in a dress!</i>""

""<i>Oi darling!  Oi darling!  Heheheheh!</i>""

""Okay, no, Dom.  Right.  God, but I wish I was there.""

""...So do I.""

""Oh, Dommie.  C'mon, now.  Shh.  ...It really does look quite good on you.""

""Hmh.  I kind of thought so, too.  Hence the photo.""

""Who took that, by the way?""

""Set it on a timer.""

""Okay.  Right.  ...No wristcuffs?""

""They didn't go.""

""You... are really something.""

""My mummy says I'm thpecial!""

""Your mummy doesn't know the half of it!  Unless..  Whose is that?""

""Mine!  Idjit.""

""Gotcha.  Have you... before, have you tried things like this before?""

""Yeah.  Sometimes.  I sort of, I just...  I'm worrying.  About what it means.  I don't know --""

""Wait, now, <b>Dom</b>.  Backing up a bit.  People at the Seven-Eleven saw you in a skirt - in that skirt, particularly - what would they think?  Probably, 'Oh, that looks a bit heavy for summer, but DAMN is it his colour.'  And what is the most heinous, wretched thought they could possibly entertain?""

""'That makes him look fat.'  Haha.""

""Dom.""

""Or.  Oh, it's a pervert.  I'd better keep my kids away from him.""

""Discrimination against perverts.  People like Viggo and Elijah are still good people!""

""...You know what I meant.  It's a little hard for that to be funny right now.""

""Well.  Are you a pervert?""

""Um!""

""Are you?""

""No?  Okay, I don't think so, not more than you, probably.  Although on second thought, it's like being tall.  Doesn't take much effort next t' you.""

""Yeah, yeah, HOWEVER.  You seem to be saying you're not a pervert.  Good, a fact.""

""What <i>is</i> a pervert?""

""Completely subjective.  Useless word at this point.  We discard it.""

""Ooookay...""

""And?""

""...I suppose they might think I'm gay, too, yeah?""

""And are ya?""

""Oh, but.  That's not really a big deal, is it.  Some o' those fans think so already, and they seem to approve, huh?""

""Well.  That's another area, isn't it.""

""Doesn't matter.  Seriously.  They can think I'm gay no matter what I wear, and that doesn't matter at <u>all</u>.""

""...Okay.  What else, anything else?""

""I don't know.  ...Drag, you know, drag is usually for gender, I think - I'm not sure though.  Dressing really masculine or really feminine.  It might be for other stuff, too, though.  Like my suit.  Normality drag.  Boring black suit with inoffensive tie.""

""Ach.  Don't bother putting yourself down, Dommie.  You looked great.  Y' always do.""

""Why, thank you, Bill!""

""I knew it!  Fishing for compliments again, y' cad?""

""Annnd they seem t' be biting!""

""Your crisis is officially over.  C'n I go 'n' piss now?""

""Right!  I'll let you <i>go</i>.""

""Augh.  If it weren't so true, it might be funny.  You prophet of our modern times.  Goodbye, Dom.  I love you.""

""Love you, too.  Bye.""

""Bye.""

<lj-cut text=""He thinks that Dominic has trouble seeing the lines."">~:


	Billy walks behind his Dominic, pondering lines.  He knows there's borders to every relation in the world; the one between him and his barber, the one between him and his sister.  Always guidelines to follow, certain ways he oughtn't behave.  He stays inside the lines.  He is very obedient when it counts.

	He thinks that Dominic has trouble seeing the lines.  That maybe he's line-blind.  When they are all seated in the booth, he knows it's true.

	They wind and intercede, blue to Billy's fancy, glowing in the dark of the club.  They separate every person and every other.  Only, the one between Billy and Dom is getting squished against both of their sides as Dom drapes himself happily over his best mate.

	""I didn't think pineapple juice and chocolate syrup would go so well,"" Dom is saying to Sean's doubtful grimace.

	""That can't be all that's in that drink,"" Sean says, eyeing the murky liquid.

	""Mm, I put some of whatever Elijah's drinking in there, too...""

	Billy and Sean turn wordlessly to Elijah, just waiting for the shoe to drop.  He raises his glass cheerily.

	""It's a Bloody Caesar!""

	The table erupts in groans and gagging noises.

	Fingers brush at Billy's neck, work their way around his collar and under his shirt, splaying gently over the skin of his shoulder, just feeling.  Billy freezes.  Dom is tipped against him, laughing, unaware that anything is amiss.  Dom's ring is metal-slick and cornered against his collarbone, but the line between them persists.  At least, he thinks it should be.  As usual, Dom is the one who can make him doubt.

	When Peter introduced Dom to the other three hobbits, he took to them all as if they were old friends.  Which is easy enough in <i>words</i>, but.

	Billy was swept away.  It was easy to let it become reality, to start as acquaintances being good friends, and God only knows where it will end.  Only it won't end - Billy knows that Dom believes it won't.  And not one of them would resist that.  Even if it wouldn't have been true, they will make it so.  It may be contagious.

	They all dance, and he watches the lines shift and play, more complex between people who are closer.  Only Dom doesn't seem to heed them, kissing Sean's jaw tenderly, and later spinning Elijah and dipping him with the lively music until a flush suffuses the pale skin, even his arms...  Billy blinks.  Got him doing it now; seeing things he's not supposed to notice.  It's a bad idea to forget what he knows about reality.  He needs that boundary.

	But then Dom is dancing in front of him, wedging thumbs into his beltloops and palms resting against each hip.  Dom's nose bumps forward, cold on Billy's neck, but his face slides hotly against Billy's own, leaving a smear of sweat when he has turned to look at something.  Soaking everything in, but still not <i>seeing</i>.

	And Dom looks Billy in the eyes as they dance, just <i>looks</i>, until Billy breaks away and goes to find another drink, hopefully something with neither clams nor chocolate.  <b>Too close</b>, his sensibilities have been screaming.  He shushes them, annoyed.  What do they know about Dom?  Nothing he has learned about human behaviours seems to apply.  Dom must be an alien.

	""What're you thinkin' about?""

	""What planet are you from?""

	Dom tilts his head, a smile blooming on his face.  ""Germany,"" he says, then crows with laughter.  ""No!  Can I be from one of the moons of Jupiter?""

	""If you like.""

	Toasting with a hearty, ""IO!"" Dom drains Billy's glass.


:~:


	When Sean drops Billy off outside his flat, and everyone says goodnight, the opposite door slams too, and Dom is on the kerb beside him.

	""I'm staying with m' Billy tonight,"" he announces, then looks so proud.  Billy blinks, pats his shoulder, and heads to unlock the door.  Dom follows.  ""Have you any olives?""

	""In the fridge,"" says Billy, and doesn't inquire.  He goes to change and get out the extra blankets.  ""Bed or sofa?""

	""Bed!""

	Billy sighs.  Frickin' Dominic.

	""No, though,"" says Dom, reading his look, ""I'll not put you on the couch.  What'd be the point of staying at your house if you aren't there?""

	Oh.  Oh, no.

	""What's wrong?""

	""Dommie...  this may be out of bounds for me to be saying,"" (and Dom's eyebrows draw together, a look of, <i>What bounds?</i>), ""but I was thinking, and I think there may be something you don't see.""  He is almost certain at this moment; this is truth, normal, inevitable.

	Dom nods slowly.  ""...The back of my head.""  He sits on the back of the sofa.

	Billy giggles, then bites his tongue.  ""I meant <u>lines</u>.  Lines between people.  Like a different line between strangers and acquaintances and friends and family, all those different people with particular ways we're supposed to be acting.  The line between me and you,"" he draws in the air with a finger, something inside him sinking to define it so sharply.  ""You don't see it, do you?""

	Dom's expression is changing, subtly only, and almost too fast to read.  But: comprehension, embarrassment, horror, disdain, to contemplation again.  Then he smiles, same as ever.  ""I see a line between we two, Billy.""  He hops down from his perch, facing him steadily.  ""The one that goes from here,"" he places two fingers over is heart, ""to here,"" and traces a line perpendicular to the blue one, touching Billy's chest.  ""And you're right.  I can't always see to tell apart those things you were listing.  But I can only be what I am, and act as I feel.  And besides, follow lines that separate people?  <i>Why?</i>""  He steps back.

	Billy's mind is whirling.  ""They're blue.  Is yours blue?""

	Dom looks at him, that frank gaze locking him in place.  ""Nn, red.  It's red.  Where's this blue line, again?""  He squints at the space between them.

	Billy traces it with his index finder, waist-level and holding.

	""Okay,"" says Dom.  He turns his back, clambering agile onto the tall part of the sofa, turning.  Gathering himself, he leaps into the air, legs tucked high, a messy jump that doesn't care how it lands.  And crashes into Billy, knocking them both to the floor.  Dom's hand is curled protectively around the back of Billy's head as they impact, then they lay together breathless for awhile.

	Dom's cheek presses against his and moves, a touch bristly.  ""Well?  Did I clear it?""  That voice in his ear, low and excited.

	""...You did.""  He did.  He did.  Cleared it all away.  ""So now what?""  A kind of dazed amazement is taking Billy over.

	Dom.  Sitting up, pulling back to look him in the eyes.  ""Anything at all.""

~:


It's a long way, even for somebody used to driving on the wrong side of the road.  Five or so hours in, Dom blinks away the little pattern overlaying his vision that means his eyes have been open too long, and takes the next exit.  Billy's turn.

The decreasing road noise or that swooping curve off the freeway wakes him, so Dom doesn't have to.  They idle in the parking lot of yet another McDonald's and grin muzzily at each other.

""Whose idea was this, again?""

""Yours.  Probably.""

""If so, then.  Hnn.  Sorry.""  Dom yawns and sighs and knocks his head against the doorframe when he gets out to stretch his legs.  

They stagger inside to use the loo.  Billy buys the least disgusting looking thing on the menu and cheap fancy coffee.  Dom gets chicken nuggets and chips and a milkshake, and curls his lip at Billy's breakfast.

""That looks disgusting.""

""Well...""  Billy stares at his food.  ""Yes.  That it does.""  He eats it anyway.


:~:


For an excruciatingly long time there was nothing but flat cornfields and featureless clouded skies.  While he was awake, Dom was perpetually adjusting the ever-changing radio stations and playing a game in which Billy had to guess whether city names Dom was listing were actual places on the map.  Now there are great rolling hills, the volume is turned down too quiet to hear anything more than hissing little drumbeats, and Dom's head is cradled forward in his seatbelt.  Takes a kind of balance that Billy doesn't really have, he muses.  Particularly not while asleep.

Less of a sunset, more of a bluegrey loss of light is happening.  Sweet humid air flushes through the AC when it begins to rain.


:~:


Rock juts up on either side of the road, and it is darker than dark.  The wipers squeak as they work.  Dom is hunched forward, reading the map by the light of the glove compartment and shaking his head.

""We should get a hotel.  This explains why Sean laughed at us.""

""What?  Somethin' besides the obvious, I mean?""

Dom marks a scale rule on his finger and calculates on the back of his wrist.  ""Ever look how many times a map of the UK would fit into a map of the US?""

""...You're kidding.""

""We have at least two more days ahead of us at this rate, Bills.  Hotel.  Hotelhotelhotel.""

""All right!  All right.  Hotel.""

""One with a buffet?""

""May as well.  There's first and second breakfast taken care of, then.""

""And a pool!""

The tires kick up a wake behind the rental car.  Rain pounds down on the roof.  And Billy squirts Dom with his water-bottle.


:~:


Dom is the one awake when daylight gets around to illuminating the mountains that have sprung up around them in the night, the ones they had known must be there from the wide, winding curves of the road.  He picks one of the towns puddled in valleys along the pass and they descend to seek out a decent hotel.  

Billy stirs from his nap.  ""It reeks of marker in here.""

The back of Dom's hand now reads MIAMI OR BUST.  Pleading exhaustion, he waits in the car while Billy procures a room.

Once in the hotel lobby, Billy is vaguely aware that he is drawing stares.  But thinks nothing of it until the receptionist excuses himself and darts into his office, shuts the door, and has a laugh that is clearly audible through the wall.  Billy ducks to check his reflection in the metallic finish under the counter, and learns that he has a curling, cartoon villain-style sharpie moustache drawn on his upper lip.

(It comes off with a little soap, as he has reason to know.)  He cackles and pretends to twirl it on his way out, to the sound of the receptionist sliding off his chair.


:~:


They don't bother with separate beds.  It would be ridiculous at this point.

Dom is honestly half asleep by the time Billy leads him to their (blissfully ground-level) room.  Slowly they port their bags inside, under the wet daylight, and start shedding travel-creased clothing as soon as the curtain is secured.  Billy claims the shower first, and within the five-minute interval (oh, ten at the <i>most</i>), Dominic is breathing sleep-slow.  The suspicious bedspread has been shucked off onto the floor, and Dom's patchy sleeping bag is draped over the whuffling lump on the bed.

There is plenty of room for two to lay without touching - these two, at least - but they don't bother with that, either. 


:~:


There are caves, in this part of the country, which have bats and blind white crickets and weird glittery rock formations.  And up on the peaks there are frozen waterfalls with icicle trickles and cascade stalactites.  And views ~ everywhere another incredible view.

Billy is reading, though.  And Dom reins himself in from pointing out every panorama or interestingly-shaped boulder as their little car navigates the curves of the road south through the Great Smoky Mountains.  Because sneaking glances of Billy's face, emoting rawly, absorbed in his book?  Is every bit as great, to Dom's way of thinking. 


:~:


Billy is in a mood.  Dom tells him so.

""Rush hour in Atlanta, Dominic.  And will ye just-- oh, roll down the window!""

""T's too hot.  It'll never dry that way.""  He fans his hands, smirking.

""Don' know what they've been telling you in L.A. and I don' care.  Putting on nail varnish during a tailback will never be cool.""

There is quiet for a while.  The elevated roads and multicoloured buildings give the city an alien look, all lemon and lavender, and almost clean under the smog.  Dom shifts in a way that means what little restraint he has is running out.

""No, Dom.""

""C'mon.  Please?  Just the left foot, then.""

""I am not.  Painting.  Your toenails.  While you're driving.""


:~:


They have fresh oranges from a touristy roadside stand, and candy bars and bottles of soda in a little cooler.  The pace is steady--

""<i>Ff<b>fuck!</b></i>""

No more than a dun flash careening from behind a stand of trees.  Dom slams on the brakes, and everything spins hard and there is a <i>noise</i> behind the shouts.  But when the semi behind them has howled past and the dust under the tires has drifted up the road a bit, the engine is still running, sort of.  He puts it in park, laughing high in his throat and shaking like anything, and shuts it all down.  Looks at Billy, who is clutching his chest-belt.

""Nice evasive action, there, mate.""

Dom coughs.  ""Thanks.""  From the ditch of the speed lane - and pointed the wrong way, to boot - they watch cars zooming by.  ""Did you see what it was?""

""An armadillo?""

Dom knuckles a pressure point in Billy's upper arm.  ""Heh.  Guess who gets to drive the whole rest of the way, Bill?""

Billy turns in time to watch the deer reach the opposite side of the dual carriageway and leap away into the sparse forest.  ""It's all right.""

Another barking laugh.  Dom's head falls back against the rest, eyes squeezed shut.  ""We could have both just died.""

Billy's hand on his friend's forehead erases the lines that were gathering there.  ""We're all right.""


:~:


The purple sky hangs oddly close as they ease down the boulevard, windows open to admit the salty breeze that hisses through the palm fronds even over the noise of the motor.

""Finally here.  Finally.""

Dom grunts.  He is chewing down the last Baby Ruth like a starving man, the map crumpled onto the car floor.

""We should do this again sometime, shou'n't we?  It was... fun.""  No reply.  ""It's not still about that deer, is it?""  The car slows even more as Billy leans a little to touch Dom's wrist.  ""It was a close call, but--""

""Oh, it's not that.  America is too big.  No one country should take that long to cross by car.  It's just... <i>wrong</i>.""

""But imagine if we'd ha' set this film of ours in California.  Scuba diving's good there, too.""

There is a moment of silence for the horror of that much distance to cover in a cramped rental car.  Dom's fingers thread into Billy's and rest there.  ""We'd have flown,"" he says fervently.

""At least this car doesn't stink.""

""Eh, it sort of <i>does</i>, I thought.""

""Well...""

""Yes.""

Billy becomes aware of the scent of hot plastic.  ""Yes.""

Their destination is in sight; yet another low, pale building of the coastal style, but this one with their names on it.  The car crawls the last few metres into the driveway, then Billy kills the engine and they sit listening to the headlight alarm.  Dom kicks his door open and sets his bare feet (complete with toenail polish) down on the still-warm tar.

""You ready for this?""

<lj-cut text=""Half the time, he doesn't even realize he's doing it."">~:


As he drives, when he stops hearing the radio.  While painting.  Outside in the evening, when the stars are reminding him how tiny and brief life is.  In the morning, when he's convincing himself to get out of bed.  When the knife slips chopping vegetables and takes a bit out of his finger.  Through strong winds.  After someone asks him if there isn't anyplace he'd rather be.

Half the time, he doesn't even realize he's doing it.  ""Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy...""



If he happens to meet a praying mantis or a butterfly.  During the washing of dishes, his voice carrying over rushing water and colliding plates and making it a song.  Whenever bright colors catch his eye to make him turn his head.  After the rain.  When he smiles so hard his face hurts.  At two a.m., when he's a little too sober and staring out the window at underlit city clouds.

A name his heart says even when his voice is silent.  ""Dom.  Dom.  Dom.  Dom.""  



He is already reaching for the phone when it rings.  They are both smiling audibly, a name singing in each head and relief running down the lines.

""I was just thinking about you.""

<lj-cut text=""If Billy and Dom were in a car together..."">~:


If Billy and Dom were in a car together, who would get to pick the music? Would it be Billy, who would doubtless forego any music later than 2000 (dismissing it as too modern for his tastes) and subjecting Dom to random Beatles tracks and bits of Led Zepplin and singing along to Bob Dylan? (It may well be before his time, but Billy refuses to let that little detail spoil his fun). Would it be Dom, who, knowing that the roadtrip was coming up, had spent three devious, mischevious hours preparing <i>Dom's MegaMix Travel Bonanza Best Music Ever CD</i> with the simple aim of driving Billy to within a brink of insanity?


:~:


It would, of course, very much depend on whose car it was.

And let us not forget the overlap. The Prince tape that even Dom knows all the words to. The alternative station that airs Coldplay back to back with The Proclaimers. The uninsultable Best Of Queen album that starts playing as a balm for frayed nerves, and stays for the headbanging during Bohemian Rhapsody. The songs everyone knows, but to which these two have customized lyrics.

...Billy could never resist Dom's Elvis impression, although for the safety of all concerned it's best if neither of them are driving during.


:~:


Driving with Dom tended to be an experience all of its own. Some people (Orlando) might suggest that Dom had little to no conception of road rules, but Billy knew differently. Dom perceived the road in a different way to other people; he never wanted to be king of the road. He slowed down by the estuary to look for herons (standing still and tall above the water), pulling over and getting binoculars out of the glove compartment. He would execute near perfect u-turns after spying what he thought was a buzzard out of the corner of his eye. He tended to get beeped at at traffic lights because he'd got sidetracked, performing slightly off-key renditions of the Buzzcocks (with air guitar) that resulted in Billy doubling up in the passenger seat, his breath tight in his chest as he cried with laughter. Driving with Dom was an experience Billy didn't particularly want to miss out on.


:~:


Dom loved to navigate while Billy drove. He loved to move them through mazes of one-way streets and roundabouts, reveling in how perfectly they worked together. He loved to be the eyes that spotted bumper stickers that would make Billy laugh, then write it on his hand to call that laugh back as many times as possible.

He loved to eat while Billy drove, and feed Billy bits of whatever he was having, sometimes against the other's will.

Maybe best of all, Dom loved to sleep while Billy drove. All the dreaming he could do (dozing in the glass-transformed sunshine, or leaning watching gravel and reflectors and chicory speeding past) wouldn't show him a safer, freer place.

He loved to-- ...well, he loved.

They called it a mild case and sent Billy home still woozy.  Dom had to hold Billy's hands away from the itchy bandage over the scar he would carry for the rest of his life.  Over that week they bought supplies, marked calendars, rearranged schedules, briefed those who most needed to know, and settled into a semblance of routine.  ...Truth is, therianthropy doesn't affect its victims in degrees.  When the full moon comes, they <i>change</i>, full stop.

Billy, while accepting most other ribbing with his usual aplomb, bloodied the nose of the first (and only) one to call him ""Puss"".

""Just-- look-- Bill-- please-- ack-- fucker-- WILL YOU STOP HITTING ME AND LET ME EXPLAIN!?""

Billy ground to a halt at last, his eyes feral, one white-knuckled fist still twisting at one of Dom's red ears.    ""Talk,"" he grunted.

""Listen to me.  I did <b>not</b> know it was going to come true.  It was a <b>joke</b>.  Do you understand me?""

They panted at each other for a long moment.  Uncertainly, Billy loosened his nails from their little divots of flesh.  ""A joke.  Dominic, you fucker.  You are never allowed to make another joke, as long as we live.""

""Which I suppose depends how many livers we've got, now.""  A particularly dark silence greeted this observation.  ""Wait, Bill, if it worked once--""  

Billy was on track instantly.  ""I wish we weren't Siamese twins!""  Dom echoed him, not quite simultaneous.

They paused, staring at each other.  Nothing at all happened.

""Cunting, buggering fuck...""

""Ah, Bills, it's not <i>so</i> bad.  C'mon.""  Dom tried to give him a hug, which only sort of worked.

""Not so bad!  We're already too well-known, there's no way in hell we'll be able to hide this, and, damn you, Monaghan,"" he moaned, ""I <i>hate</i> circus food!""

:~:


It's hard at first.  I've been to my share of those roller rink birthday parties, but you have to realize that that was two decades ago now, or getting there.  Only a few times since then, and I'm not sure what made me choose this, other than it seemed Dommish, and I'm positive I'm going to have a bad spill any minute now.  I take a little time at the edge of the floor, getting used to the roll and list of the skates, while he warms up to easily looping the floor, looking like grace personified.  Maybe that's why I chose it.  A good reason, I tell myself, but I do believe I am too mesmerised to listen.

He swoops and closes on my position, making a tiny circle at the end of the stroke, moving like calligraphy.  

""Been awhile?""

I nod.  He holds out his hand to me.

""It'll come back,"" he says, and we go.

""I'm sure it will,"" I murmur, gripping his hand for support when I slip backwards.  His arm bears me up, and I can see his muscles changing under coloured light.  God, I love him.  It's terrible to love someone this much, slow and unmelting like glaciers, that one's heart wants to flow and freeze around another person and keep them forever as they are.  I'd rather see him moving like this; I want to know that he isn't still.  <i>We can move and be together</i>, I tell my stupid fascinated heart, as we do just that, hand in hand at first and then letting go but still brushing, coming from behind and telling him with gentle touches, <i>I'm here</i>.  That's all I say with my hands, over and over.  That or, <i>I'm falling!</i>  I don't know whether to wish him to understand.

<lj-cut text=""''I'm sure I can show you a better time than any o' those drunkards.''"">~:


They walked - no, <i>strolled</i> along the river, comfortably arm in arm.  Lampposts marked a warm orange path, the summer night humid and humming with quieted life.  Raucous laughter marred any romantic atmosphere, but that was to be expected.

Billy was nearly doubled over.  ""I've seen a lot of good looks in the time I've known you, but that had t' be one of the best.""

""She certainly didn't expect it.  None of them did.  I don't suppose you did, either,"" mused Dom, almost to himself.

""But why not, after all?  I'm sure I can show you a better time than any o' those drunkards.""

""So you claim.  I'll be holding you to that, remember.""

""And isn't this a good start?  Nice walk by the river and all.""  Billy was slurring a bit, probably from too much laughing rather than alcohol, of which he had imbibed relatively little, although nobody watching would have guessed he was sober.

""Where to next?""

""Well.  The night is still young.  Wanna go get in trouble?""

""Depends on the trouble.  Aren't you supposed to be taking me on a date?""

""Aye, but it's <i>you</i>.  Don't want you to be bored.  Imagine, my best mate bored on a date with m'self?  I'd never live it down.""

Dom playfully tried to trip him.  ""Don't make me imagine it.  You take your friends out often?""

""This is something of a special case, actually.  It's you.""

""So you've mentioned.""

""I'd not just take out any old best friend who comes my way.  Mm, nope.""

They abandoned that line of conversation, as Dom was losing track of which bits were joke and which were serious, if any.

""Are you hungry at all?""

""Yeah, it's been awhile since afternoon tea.  Is it time for dinner now, or supper?""

""Dinner is first, I think.  Sounds lighter somehow.  Well, I know a decent place for either one.""

""Lead on!""

It was near, just over a low, flat bridge and up a bright shop-lined waterfront and down a flight of wet stairs sinking into the street.  Steam billowed up around them as they descended, issuing from cracks in the cement.  The restaurant was small, a riot of red and white and yellow light, played to by a noisy, enthusiastic band and packed with people of similar temperment.  Dinner was sukiyaki, dipped in raw egg, which was criminally delicious and a first for Dom.

Billy snatched the bill when it came, and wouldn't let him see.  ""My treat.  Sit down and finish your rice.""

""You'll get yours,"" threatened Dom darkly.  ""I'm buying next time.""

""Your perogative,"" was the reply, and Dom polished off his egg-soaked rice, mollified.  There was a strange sparkle about Billy just then, Dom thought.  Then, 'I want to go to Japan as soon as possible.  This food is like--'  But he was distracted before completing his simile, because Billy grabbed his hand and pulled him up and out a different door than they had come in.

They ran across the street - Dom closed his eyes for that part, a bit sedated from all the starch - and into another doorway.  The interior was dark, but loud music was happening.  Billy slapped some tickets down on the counter and they continued through into a wide arena with sweeping colored lights and people traversing the floor in a circular flow.  A chin settled on Dom's shoulder, a mischievious voice cackled directly into his ear, and a pair of roller skates were pressed into his hands.  

Billy wasn't comepletely unskilled on wheels, but Dom had been roller blading about Manchester and acting school for years.  He could even stop himself without running into the wall (which seemed to be Billy's main strategy).  The unrepentantly 80s music actually had him almost dancing.  Dom grinned across the blur of bodies, easily picking out Billy, who was holding opposite him at the moment.  He shook his head - he hadn't realized he missed roller skating.

At the end of the song, lights pulsed and the DJ shouted, ""COUPLE SKATE!  Singles, clear the floor!""

Dom swerved to head off the edge onto the carpeting, but was sideswiped barely a meter from safety.  He and his assailant crashed to the floor together, knocking the wind out of him, but gentle, familiar hands helped him sit up.  ""Couple skate doesn't mean <i>leave</i>,"" Billy scolded.

They clambered to their feet, joined hands, and skated - no, say <i>danced</i> - as well as they could.  Dom turned effortlessly to pull Billy with both hands, spun them both in a slow circle, sped up and banked and trailed their hands along the wall...

How could he say enough that it was strange?  It should have felt stranger, no doubt.  It was strange.  Dreamlike.  And good.  Entirely unlike any date Dom had ever had, but that was to be expected.  He kept his eyes on Billy's face most of the time, watching that odd sparkle light and light.  Song after song, until it stopped fading anymore and just lit all the time, mesmeric.

They finally stopped, entirely out of breath.

""This's a great song,"" Dom gasped.

""Coldplay, yeah?""

""Shiver.""

""Okay.""  Billy took Dom's hand and pressed it to his own cheek, letting Dom feel a tremor there.

Dom looked at him.  ""That's the song title.""

""Oh, I know.""

Eh.  ""Of course.""

They lay on the low benches until they could walk, turned in their skates, and turned themselves out into the cooling night.

""That date seemed pretty well-planned to me, Bills.""

""I try,"" said Billy, ""but it isn't quite over yet.""  He tipped his head back as they went, face pointed up toward misty stars, three fingertips lightly resting on Dom's shoulder.  Abruptly, he turned.  ""This way.""

A dark stone walk led into a city park, well-walled with trees.  Something standing in the moonlight, but not people--

""There was an ice sculpture contest here today.  They're leaving them to melt...""

There was an enormous, round-scaled fish, whiskered like a dragon.  A life-sized motorbike that looked a far sight nicer than the one Dom had back in Manchester.  A waterspout rising from a choppy frozen ocean.  An angel, wings spread and illuminated by starlight.  What appeared to be a campfire, opaque and glistening, complete with a surrounding ring of stones.  Dom exclaimed in delight to find a Weta beetle, larger than even in life, chiseled carefully from the ice.

""Dare you to lick it,"" he said.

""You.""

Dom did, crunching gleefully on its antennae.  ""Refreshing!""

Billy sat on a bench in the center of the display.  Soon Dom joined him, watching and listening to the sculptures drip and the muffled nighttime city sounds, New Zealand noises all around.

""This is amazing.  Those wings...""

""I like the fire,"" said Billy quietly, sparking bright.  

Dom looked at his friend closely.  ""Something different about you tonight, Billy.""

""Anything different about you, Dom?""

He blinked, surprised.  ""I don't know.  What do you think?""

Billy looked him in the eye for the first time in an hour, searchingly, quite near.  ""I think maybe so.  How'd you like to find out?""

The ice glittered, seeming to draw silence in about them.  ""Yeah.""  He breathed deep.  ""I should know something like that.""

""Guess what.""

""What?""

Billy leaned against him, heads together side-by-side.  ""I'm scared out of my mind,"" Billy told him in a whisper.  Then turned, slowly.  Turned their faces toward each other, moved in a way he never had.  Found Dom's mouth with his own; cautious, warm, shaking.  Seeking.

Found that Dom kissed back; cool from the ice, nervous, yielding, affectionate and brave.  Strange.  Natural.

Sparked like stars.

There is a boy hanging nervously at the edge of the room, one Dominic doesn't recognise.  He knows the look, though.  <i>There are nerds, and then there are Nerds</i>, says that stance.  Those types generally don't come more than once.  This one may be different, though; there's something wistful about the set of his (oh, quite lovely) mouth, or perhaps his (greengreengreen) eyes...

He is jolted from his reverie by an elbow to the ribs.  ""T's you, secretary,"" mutters Craig, and Dom pulls himself together and hops off the desk he was sitting on, taking Sean's place at the podium.

""All right, are there any announcements?""

Quiet.  That bloke (that pretty one) is staring at him.  Well, everybody is, but.

""'Kay.  Remember, there's RPing on Friday, but no meetings next week for the holiday, so have a great one.  Nai tiruvantel ar varyuvantel i Valar tielyanna,"" he finishes, nodding dismissal, and a breath later the room is buzzing with chatter.

He can hear Craig laughing at him as Dom wanders over towards the door.  Craig is too damned perceptive, is what.  At least in matters of the, um... attractive male.

Viggo is already there, a friendly hand on the young man's shoulder.  ""I'm sure it wouldn't take you long to finish the rest over the holidays.  You're a step or so ahead already, 'f you've read the Silmarillion. And I know you'd get along with these guys,"" he is saying, flashing his Strider grin.  ""Oh, and this,"" Viggo slings an arm along Dom's shoulders, bringing the two face to face, ""is Dominic.  The one I told you about.  Dom, meet Billy Boyd.""

Billy looks at him intently with clear, familiar eyes, and <i><b>smiles</b></i>, and Dom loses track of his heart completely.

They attended church together with Jamie's mum on Christmas Eve - the kind with standing and sitting and reciting things out of the program, and shaking hands with your neighbors and clapping after the soloist finishes.  A bellchoir trooped on and off the scene, and a massive tree took up half the stage - alter - whatever thing.

Geoffrey did not fall asleep.  He did drip candle wax on his suit.  He was unused to it - religious ceremony.  He was surprised Jamie put up with the whole affair, and said so a few days later as they sat sipping morning tea in their nightclothes.  Jamie looked at him long and searchingly, then made him get dressed and go on a tramp down to the water's edge.

A few gulls circled in the clouded sky.  The snow was scant; the day had been unusually warm.  Eternal grey waves crashed against the shore.

""I don' know,"" said Jamie, having clambered up to perch on a rock, ""as you'd call it religious, so much.""  He picked up the conversation exactly where it had been halted, as if taking it off pause.  ""You have t' pick what you listen to at the kirk, sometimes.  Stuff about love, you keep.  Stuff about guilt, you leave.  What I go for,"" he said, with great conviction, ""is the music.""

""<i>Ideo...  Ideo...  Ideo, gloria in excelsis deo!</i>""  Jamie sang out across the bay in a sweet wild voice.  He tilted his face towards heaven as the first warm raindrops pattered down.

I am in an odd state of mind.  A precious, transient one.  

We lie pressed together, and his eyes are closed, but his fingers are still travelling over and over what bare skin of mine he can access.  I begin to feel the cool air of the room again, and pull the blanket over us untidily.  Both because I would rather it be flat and even, and because we are messy.

Tonight I will savour my disorder.  I will allow the candle on the nightstand to flicker.  I linger in the chaos of sensation that comes from having used my body; a relatively recent thing, and it isn't easy yet.

Sex still doesn't make sense to me, logically.  That's something I don't care to tackle, now, though not with him next to me, all warm and lax and contact-hungry as ever, the flush of satiation still in his shoulders and face.  <i>He</i> means it makes no sense to try to reason it out.  What's needed is to <b>do</b> it, feel it with my whole self, and perceive the connection if I can.  Experiment first, hypothesize later.  An odd thing to learn from a detective.  An odd detective, I know. 



He used to kiss me until he was hard, make an excuse, and slip off to wank... leaving me frustrated and despairing, feeling dirty and untouchable and <b>judged</b>.  I put a stop to it, but that mistrust nearly broke us.  His face, the first time I yelled at him ~ you'd've thought his Mrs. Wainthropp was stripping in the street for how surprised he looked.  I would have laughed if I could have.

I can't afford to throw away love, but that's not why I forgave him.  Something about how he cried when he realised he'd hurt me - maybe that.  How he couldn't keep his hands off me once he knew I wanted him as much (which told me it was my fault, too).

Tonight I have the privilege, the <i>luck</i>, to lick my lips and taste him.  The realisation still threads something fluttery through my every extremity, and I roll a little to give him the sort of soft kiss that always prompts that sensation.  His mouth opens to mine.  His hands are on me even now.

Incomprehensible.

Perfect.

I confess I love freckles.  They're so like stars on skin; tangible, unique, and beautiful.  My Geoffrey is covered in them.

The wind pushes around the structures at the top of the park, bearably chill.  Elijah swears softly as yet another match goes out.  Billy checks his watch.

""About four more minutes,"" he says into Dom's ear, who scoots closer.  The zip on his windbreaker is broken and separating upwards, and in order to fight that he needs thigh contact.  

Clove smoke drifts past, and a hissing moment later the little pavillion is lit by a spray of multicoloured sparks.  ""Got one!  C'mon you guys, light more off this one, keep 'em going!""

Orlando is tearing into the other packs of sparklers and handing them 'round liberally.  They all have some of each; Dom's first shoots fat white trails, while Billy's turns slowly through several colors and peters out.  Miranda has one in each hand, both emitting yellow balls of fire that pop perilously.  Viggo has one that hardly sparks at all, and he shelters it and turns it this way and that, experimenting.

Billy's next one, lit off the glowing stub of Dom's, is one like Viggo's.  In the lee between Dom and Billy, and held tip-down, what looks like molten metal gathers at the end, and the faintest lines of bronze light stream in every direction.  Abruptly, tiny webs of golden snowflakes snap outwards, filling the calm between them.  Dom starts a second of the same, carefully, sparks falling on his skin without harm.  Held parallel, the fireworks overlap, and the fractal pattern is too complex, too beautiful to keep.  When those have dripped to the concrete, they find two more and begin again.

Somewhere below, the shrine's great bell peals out the first of one hundred and eight strokes.

Billy and Dom are illuminated, to each other, with the subtlest, finest light.  ""Happy New Year,"" they whisper.

""On your knees, Bill.  Turn around, please.  There we are.""  The newspapers beneath them rustle and twist.  Dom straddles Billy's legs from behind, and Billy is perfectly still, hardly breathing now.  He does arch his neck slightly to accept the wet smear of Dom's finger and the streak it leaves.  Dom bends him forward, settling his weight onto Billy's calves, and slides an arm around his middle to hold him at the angle he wants.  His right hand he drags back over the palette; blue, and blue mixed with white, a modern woad that demarcates each rib, each vertebra.

Not a sound escapes Billy, not even a gasp, not even when Dom works the paint in beneath the tailbone.  White, there, a perfect focus in the notch below his spine.

""I'm afraid the blindfold may have to come off,"" Dom informs him, full of regret.  ""Guess I want you bare for this.  But I'll leave it 'till the end, that'll be good, yeah?""

He expects no response, and would indeed be rather peeved if he got one.  It's part of the game.

Dom pays close attention to the lumbar region and buttocks and the backs of Billy's thighs, then, creating a wild, symmetrical sweep of colour leading the eye inexorably inwards and around to the front.  Then lets go, lying on his side to continue the path over hipbone and ticklish, yielding lower belly.  Billy's mouth is softly open, expressionless.  Dom sits up as quietly as he can to place a kiss there.  ""You are beautiful,"" he says in a low voice - quieter each time, knowing he will be heard.  Billy finally moves, hands still at his sides, and Dom permits him to seek blindly with his lips and tongue until their mouths are connected again.

Probably only a minute or so passes before Dom gently draws away to retrieve his brushes.  Impatience is rushing him on, and the wider strokes suit Billy's limbs and chest well, and will certainly feel good.  Dom gets up to wash his hands also; some bits of Billy need no paint to be perfect.

</small>
<lj-cut text=""He woke laughing...""> &nbsp;  &nbsp; ~:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke laughing, sitting up halfway before losing momentum and flopping back down to the lumpy ground.  Sounds of low voices and the smell of a cookfire suffused the air, not to mention blinding sunshine.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""What were you dreamin'?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Pippin came into focus, seated cross-legged nearby with his bedroll bunched up around him.  His eyes were almost all the way open.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Merry laughed again at the lingering feeling.  ""I don' know.  I think there was something I was supposed to be doing, though.""  He sat up all the way and stretched, swinging his arms.  ""Get any rocks last night?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Yeh,"" said Pippin, gesturing with a thumb to his lower back.  ""A big one.  But you missed it, because Gimli's already eaten it for breakfast.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Speaking of which~,"" Leaning on Pippin's shoulder, Merry levered himself up.  Weaving slightly, he made his way to the fire to obtain two plates from Boromir, who yawned in the middle of ""Good morning"" and squinted blearily at him.  He plopped back down beside his cousin again, spilling not a scrap.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""What kind of thing, do you think?  Like a quest?""  Pippin said dreamily after a few bites.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Mmm.  Not a quest.""  Merry caught a yawn just from hearing Boromir's jaw click shut a few yards away, chuckling when it spread to Pippin.  Who smiled and listed a bit to the side.  ""We could have slept longer.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""What, and miss breakfast?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""I mean all of us.  Boromir is even tired, look--""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Pippin snuck a glance backwards, his hair whipping out to brush by Merry's face as his head turned.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Hey!  Your hair got me.  D'you know you're leaning, look at you...""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; His cousin met his eyes calmly. ""Do ye know <i>you</i> are?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Oh, really,"" Merry said blankly.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Mm-hmm.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Neither of them moved.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Was it a chore, then?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Merry shook his head, finished his meal, and tilted slowly like a falling tree caught in many little branches.  He landed softly against Pippin's bedroll.  ""Not a chore.  Not a job.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Mischief?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""I already told you I don't remember.  Do you suppose Legolas is tired?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Do elves even get tired?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""They must.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Pippin wrinkled his nose.  ""If they don't, he should take our watches.  Although,"" he concluded with a sigh, ""I suppose that wouldn't be fair.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""No...  No, it wasn't mischief.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""What else would make you laugh like that?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Shrugging, Merry shut his eyes.  The sun was awfully bright.  He shifted around a bit, settling sideways onto Pippin's lap, until he was more comfortable than he'd been all night, and let his attention wander.  Sam's voice wound about Frodo's, fading in and out, and Legolas laughed.  Someone dropped something heavy.  Pippin put a damp hand on Merry's forehead.  An unfamiliar bird was singing its heart out, directly up.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Don't go back to sleep, Mer.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""M'not.""  He was, but.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Oh, Strider says there's coffee...""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Merry smiled and stretched again, throwing an arm backwards over Pippin's lap.  ""Did you want some?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; No answer.  Pippin slid a hand briskly down his arm.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""What?""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""There was a spider on you.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""I like spiders.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Not big hairy ones.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; The laugh wouldn't be contained.  ""Big hairy ones, you wouldn't be brushing away.  Big hairy ones, you'd be borrowing Glamdring and taking my arm off in the process.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Would not!""  Pippin's right arm settled across Merry's chest, leaning.  Shadow slipped over his face, but he felt warmer than ever.  Vulnerable also, on his back with his throat exposed to the sky, sightless, but safe.  Of course.  It hardly warranted thinking about.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Would too.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Oi, Merry.""  Pippin's face was very near, and the air changed with proximity.  The hand slid away from his forehead and settled on his shoulder.  ""Merry.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; Soft lips touched his forehead, easing a headache he hadn't known was there.  His eyes opened in time to watch Pippin's neck stretch to drop a clumsy-angled kiss on Merry's mouth as well.  There was a weird little stillness, the sun back in his eyes, then Merry laughed.  He sat up halfway, turning, shaking away Pippin's arms.

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; ""Upside-down?  Pip!""  Merry tutted.  ""Come on, I'll show you how it's supposed to go.""

 &nbsp;  &nbsp; After Pippin's squeak of surprise, it was mostly Frodo's laughter that could be heard, along with a variety of other amused voices.  Merry didn't let them distract him from doing what he was supposed to be doing.

Blue lights, mainly, flashing lights.  Something with a fast beat is playing, and the lyrics aren't english, and the instrumentals are bearable.  Miranda is stretched and loose.  Miranda could go all night.  She is dancing, has lost immediate awareness of her limbs, and is letting them do their own thing.  She is grateful that they seem competent, even after all that Glenlivet.

A familiar presence encroaches, and Miranda recognises Dominic at the stroke of his fingers along the small of her back.  She angles towards him, a smile happening by itself, and the rest of her responding to his stance.  Friend though he be, he looks edible tonight.  There is something limber and soft about his body that begs to be tested.

<i>Too bad he's spoken for.</i>

She leans closer, still dancing, still dancing.  ""When did you start wearing eyeliner?""

He doesn't give an inch.  In fact, he <i>takes</i> most of the inches left between, does away with them.  ""Y' like it?""  Dom lifts his chin, approaching her own; her heart jumps foolishly.

They dance.  The song changes before it has quite ended.  They dance.

Their hips collide lightly.  And again, less so.  Miranda darts a look sideways to where their friends are, thronged about a few tables, but doesn't see--

She smells him (belatedly) a split second before his lips graze her cheek.  Miranda's focus and her face snap back to Dom.  Their mouths touch, off-center.  His eyes glint.  Her fingers go under the fold of his shirt collar to bring the kiss into alignment, incredulous as he opens to her.

Shaken, Miranda pulls away, and loses the room's collective beat entirely.  She stops dancing.  The floor feels to be surging up and down, the room with it - everything but her.  Dom slows awkwardly and looks a question.

""Billy's all right with that, then?"" she ventures.

His brows arch.  ""What business is it of his?""  Dom twists away before she can respond, prowling off barward.

She retreats to the wall, licking her lips.  As she catches her breath, a friendly touch to her hair does not startle her - Bernard stands at her shoulder, frowning bemusedly.

""And Billy doesn't object?"" he asks.

""I don't know,"" Miranda says.  ""We maybe were mistaken..?""

""Not likely.  Remember all the.""  Bernard tilts his head expressively.

She nods, and excuses herself to get an ice water.  She drinks it too fast, then heads back out to dance, a bit clumsy from a surfeit of <i>thinking</i>.  Liv is in the crowd this time, all laughing mouth in a flash of light, and Miranda catches her wrist and dances close to her until she can relax again.

The moment she releases her friend back into the press of people, Dom is there.  He wrinkles his nose.  ""Are you angry?""  Miranda has to read his lips to understand it.  When she shakes her head, he grins and surges forward again, pushing up against her affectionately.  She clasps her hands at the back of his neck and allows his touch at her waist, and the little licking kisses he places here and there - collarbone, throat, bridge of nose.

Over his shoulder she watches Bernard and Billy, deep in conversation.  Two and a half songs they dance before anything comes of it.

Billy sets his chin on Dom's shoulder, possessive fingers hooking into Dom's front beltloops.  ""Quit jerking them around, Dom.""  Dom writhes under his touch like a wild animal, neck arching and dark eyes flashing.  He mouths at Billy's jaw before stilling into his grip.  ""I don' mind,"" Billy tells Miranda in a tone that carries clearly through the music, ""sae long as ye bring him back.""

<b>There</b> it is.  She leans once more into Dom, giving Billy time to turn away if he doesn't want a physical concordat.  He doesn't turn away.

<lj-cut text=""round three, story one"">
~:


Fran knows.  He doesn't know how, but she knows.  He's seen her shooting sympathetic (encouraging) looks when he feels the most like freaking out and doing something drastic.  She may, in fact, be the only reason Dom hasn't done something drastic yet.

He's not sure what that would be, but is aware that it would be neither dignified nor pretty.

Viggo knows, too.  This one's a bit plainer; Viggo is a student of the human soul, and Dom is human to an unfortunate degree.  Viggo found him one day when he'd stolen off to look at rings (again) - <b>stupid</b> thing, but Viggo didn't scold.  He just ruffled Dom's hair and rubbed his shoulders while Dom dripped messily on Viggo's shirt.

Neither of them have tried to tell him what a beautiful thing it is to be in love.  Which is good.  Because it doesn't look very beautiful from where Dom's sitting.  It looks a bit psychotic, actually.  He's turned into one gigantic, ragged, underdone wish.  Such a strong wish that he's losing track of what's really in front of him.

Daydream Billy and actual Billy can't get mixed up - that's not allowed.  It's <i>dangerous</i>.

And there's the focus of it all.  Dom is hung up on Billy.  Massively hung up.  He tries to keep it low-profile, but that feels like leading about wild elephants and probably looks like some sort of sickness.

Billy doesn't know.  Which is good.  And impossible, and necessary, and.  Dom may go mad with it.


:~:


He should have waited for a holiday or made up an occasion, he knows this, but right now his mind is a perfect hollow blank.  With maybe some fruit flies buzzing around in the empty space in his skull.  Yeah, fruit flies.

Billy is ripping off the bit of brown wrapping paper and looking so delighted.  Dom should have brought his camera.

Dom should have used any other kind of box, besides a ring box.

He fists his hands, uncomfortable beyond any previous memory of the feeling, as Billy looks up at him with round, startled eyes.  He tries to think of something to say, some joke to make it unimportant.  His throat knots.

Billy slips on the ring, smiling, admiring it on his hand, then reaches for Dom's, and Dom doesn't have any choice but to let him lift it, pry open the fingers, and compare-- yes.  Same finger and everything.  Billy clinks his ring against Dom's, and they are both entranced by the facets.

""Matching rings.""  Billy is standing kind of close.  ""Thank you, Dom.  D'ye mean that, then?""

Dom can't make words.  His heart is pounding so hard he can see his whole body shaking with it.  Abruptly Dom is sobbing an incoherent confession into Billy's shoulder.

Billy's arms are around him, holding him up.  ""You couldn't've just told me?  Christ, Dominic.  Shh.  You're okay.  I love you, y' crackbrained cunt.""

Billy knows.  Which is good.  And impossible, and necessary, and.  Dom may go mad with it.

"event","<b>Title:</b> The Brave Moment (1/2)
<b>Author:</b> <lj user=""vensre"">
<b>Starring:</b> Billy/Dom, Ali/Billy
<b>Rating:</b> PG
<b>Disclaimer:</b> The way that I can imagine is not the true Way.
<b>Notes:</b>  One drabble and four droubbles.  Part one was written for <lj user=""aralinde"">.  


<lj-cut text=""That's when.""><font face=""trebuchet"">~:


The day, the very day he decided to say it.  It.  That day, that was the day she kissed him.

He had a slight fever in the morning, and was drinking lemon tea with a hot towel wrapped around his neck and calling, and calling, and calling, and.  

Oh, Dom never picked up.  That's the way it goes, Billy told himself, talk yourself into something and just see if the world complies, cooperates with your plans.  Just see.

He felt better in the evening, and agreed to go dancing with some of his old friends, and that's when.  That's when.


:~:


It was all very unknown, unpredictable, unprecidented.  Something that started off easier to ignore... but after a time, began to blend roughly in with other feelings, making everything a little grating and... <i>off</i>.

But between BillyandDom, there was no <i>off</i>.  And he refused to let there be.  So it was time to tell Dom about the odd impulses, the wishes, the dark vast vacuum building behind his ribs--

Billy's hand came up of its own volition to rub there, warding off the odd sensations with plain physical touch.  Any touch would do, he told himself.  It didn't have to be Dominic.  'F Dom <i>were</i> here, though, he'd sit on Billy if Billy asked.  He'd hold him, wouldn't he.  Without hesitation or suspicion.  Billy felt guilt like adrenaline slide through him, but he didn't exactly have designs on an innocent, now, did he?  Designs, that wasn't the word for what he had.

Had.  Had had.  Would have.

Billy would design the real word on Dom.  He wrote on the table with one finger, leaving faint (but readable) streaks.

L O V E

A long, staring moment later, he let his forehead blot the marking out, with a <i>thunk</i> that rattled the saucer.


:~:


She was dressed sharply, but her voice was soft and blunt.  They ate together and she followed him about the dance floor, and he felt the coiling fall towards her like a sinkhole.  Except, she didn't mean him any harm.  She <i>liked</i> him.  He watched his friend Ali and saw her liking him in the wild lights.  Watched the others watching them.  He blinked and sighed and kept dancing.

Quite good live music was blasting too loud, and the motion of people on the floor was becoming too piecy, choppy as rough water.  Billy wasn't drinking, but that didn't help enough.

""I have a cold,"" he told her, drawing back.  This wasn't what he'd intended.  This would be reversed, giving up when he'd promised--

Her look was one of rebuke.  ""So share,"" she said, leaning in, pulling in.

Billy slid forward, blinking backwards, eyes flickering open briefly.  His head tipped, trying to hear, panic eating through the walls of the world, and then their mouths were touching.  Unreal, surreal.  She kissed him a question, and he bent the truth, not terribly far.  <i>I like you.

...But I love him.</i>  No kiss can say that unless the listening lips already understand.


:~:


<i>Maybe it'll take you there.

And maybe it</i> won't.


He wrote a letter and burned it.  Wrote another, and burned it worse, tore it to little bits beforehand.  It wasn't supposed to be an effigy, he told himself crossly, it was supposed to be <i>sent</i>.

There is an easier way, his self replied, startling him so badly that he dropped burned scraps of paper all over the floor.  He stared down at the black random snow over medium oak, nudged it into flaky ash with a toe, then went to get a broom.  And a phone.

Billy sweated.  He sat on the floor, running a thumb over and over the plastic cover on the display of his mobile.  Smearing the little bit of oil from skin left there, all to one grain and flow.  He bent nearer and made a crosshatch pattern with a fingertip, transparent plaid atop Dom's number, digital and ready.

Set it on end on the floor.  Stood, backing away.

Deep breaths, deep shivery breaths, and a cough, and.  ""I love you.  No, I'm <i>in</i>--""

He whirled and retreated to the window, shaking.  The cool air and the heat (blooming up the glass) only reminded him again.


:~:


It was a year, all the way back to winter again before Dom asked Billy if he loved Ali.

Billy went numb and shaky and horrified and fell apart a little and didn't really answer, no.  Since then he knew Dom was worrying.

<i>Good.</i>

More letters, after all, and phone confessions which aborted into rambling jokes and the safer sort of mind-reading.  The sort that doesn't pry, only accepts.  Because Dom was good at that.

But he asked again in the early spring, visiting on a day that smelled like forever, and Billy was silent and looked up at the sky.

""What does that mean?  Don't you?""

""I lo--"" and his words fell away, all unintentional.

""What?  Yes?  Billy.""  Dom was looking at him, golden (but that was only the sunlight, wasn't it, hitting him just so?) and almost unfamiliar with that shine over his eyes.

And.  ""No.""  Said Billy, ""O' course I do, but, just.  No.  Not like ye'd think, after all this time.""

""Really.""

Billy pulled his hands into his sleeves, oddly chilled.

""Then...""  The <i>why?</i> stayed in Dom's mouth, where it belonged.  It could just <b>wait</b> there.  Like they'd all been waiting.

And Ali <u>never</u> asked.

Dom knew he was finally getting used to air commuting when he arrived at the airport in Okinawa not even <i>tired</i>.  The time difference was slight - no worse than flying from Chicago to L.A., and the trip actually seemed shorter.  Not like the transatlantic flights that used to destroy him between London and the States.  Not even-- but Dom was distracted at this point in his thoughts by the rows of orchids decorating the disembarking passage.  Leading out to the gates, into the main lobby, and how odd to allow smoking in an airport, and thank goodness he had his currency changed in Kansai International when he entered the country, because it was certainly too late for that now.  There was a-- ah, good, they bothered to put english signs up.  For all his cramming in the weeks before (and on the plane), the writing system eluded him completely.  Gate twelve...  gate twelve...

And there it was.  He plunked himself down in one of those ugly plastic seats - oddly low, here, and angled backwards - and fixed his eyes on the sky outside.  Only a little light still lingered from the sunset, and he could see nothing concrete of the island, only water and lights.  The flight from Tokyo was scheduled to arrive twenty-five minutes after his, and he'd be damned if he wasn't going to meet them.  He wriggled in his seat.  Vacation!  Japan!  Bills and Viggo and Orli!  And Miranda and Sean and Lawrence and Andy joining them in a few days, and Elijah if he could squirm out of some dire previous commitment.  He cracked open a box of the chocolate-covered biscuit sticks he'd got out of a vending machine in Osaka and crunched on them while he threaded one of the silver coins with the hole in the middle onto his necklace.  It clinked brightly with Ali's engagement washer, and he grinned, and leaned back, and thought about his friends flying through the air towards him, and closed his eyes - just for a minute - against the annoying white lights.

*

He woke suddenly when something heavy landed on him, crushing the air out of his lungs.  Somethings.  Moving and loud and sharp knees, and he hugged his attacker happily, and learned it was Orlando without even opening his eyes.  With Billy close behind, a carry-on flopping over his shoulder to smack into Dom but neither caring much as they greeted each other.  Billy hauled him to his feet, and Viggo pounced and knocked their skulls together, and Dom bit his tongue hard upon impact but wasn't about to complain.  And then there was a massive hug, a confusing, mutliperson hug, and they'd towed him down the terminal quite a ways before he started understanding what they were saying.

""Viggo's been here before.  You speak Japanese, too, don't you?""

""Not much, but I could probably get by.""

""You could probably get by <i>anywhere</i>,"" put in Dom, thinking of Viggo's day-long disappearance in Berlin before the premiere of Return of the King.  He had reappeared with what was essentially a locomoting party trailing after him.  ""You'd make a good Buddhist monk.  Everyone would give you food.""

The corners of Viggo's mouth twitched up, and he eyed Dom's Pocky brazenly.

""All right!"" Dom surrendered the box to his friends, nabbing one last piece.  He tucked it under his lip, letting it point down out of his mouth, then manoeuvred it around with his tongue, sucking the chocolate off the tip.  This so occupied his mind that he nearly fell down the escalator, but Billy steadied him hastily.

""Still asleep, are we?""

Dom was all set to say, ""I'm not even tired, though,"" around his Pocky.  But was distracted again when Billy's teeth latched onto the other end of said biscuit stick and, after a moment spent twinkling at Dom, bit more than half of what remained clean off.  ""Hey, get your own!"" is what Dom tried to say then, but they had reached the bottom of the escalator somehow, and he stumbled again.  Billy still had ahold of his arm, though, so nothing inauspicious was allowed to happen.

Orli took Dom's backpack then, handing it off to Viggo.  ""Bedtime for Sblommie.  And it's not even nine o'clock!""

""How about we get some food first?""  Viggo had a faraway look, like Aragorn tracing over a map with his mind.  ""Not a word to BK about this, but I know a place near here that sells the curry of your life.""

""The Curry Of Your Life?""  Orlando; sleepy, but intrigued.  ""Sounds enlightening.  I could go for some curry.  Would it be spicy?""

""If you want.""  Viggo was describing the relative hotness system of japanese curry, but Dom couldn't listen anymore.  He yawned, cracking his jaw.

""Admit it.  You're about to keel over,"" Billy muttered into Dom's ear.

Dom giggled, sounding silly even to himself.  ""Maybe.  Think the excitement's shorted out my brain.""

""Fair enough.  Sleep in the taxi?""

""Don't mind if I do.""  Dom put an arm over Billy's shoulders and <i>leaned</i>.

""In the taxi, y' wanker!  Not here!""

They bumped through Alien Processing, handed over paperwork and passports and visas, and were let pass with barely a glance from security.  (There were plenty of Americans in the crowd, Dom noticed vaguely - mostly military, from the look of them.)  Then to the baggage claim, where he had to split off to find his luggage.  It wasn't the fiasco he had expected.  Nearly everyone else had theirs already, and Dom's bags were circling the conveyor belt and looking lonely.  He rescued them and put them on one of those useful little rolly-carts waiting nearby, pushed off to collect the others.  Who, it seemed, had been quicker than he to find everything, and were now waiting patiently by the oversized brown doors.

Together they pushed into the receiving gate - a wide glassed-in chamber, surrounded by tropical aquaria -  and made their way through the last checkpoint.

""Maxine!""  Viggo's voice made several people turn and look, and Dom couldn't blame them.  But he already had ahold of the person whose attention he sought, and was embracing her warmly.  ""I thought you couldn't make it!""

Maxine was perhaps sixty-five, taller than Dom but shorter than Viggo, with a tidy puff of grey hair and a kind, clever face.  ""Oh,"" she said, smiling and patting his back, ""Bill's eyes aren't what they used to be, but he said he could spare me this one evening.  And I brought the van, so...  How was the flight?  You'll have to introduce me,"" she waved, indicating his three companions.  Her accent was unmistakably American.

Viggo gave her their names, and she bowed to each of them, smiling in a friendly - edging on amused - manner.  ""Come, then, you must be exhausted.  Did you want to stop for groceries before you go to the rental mansion?""

""How about that curry place in Naha, is that still there?""  Viggo wasn't going to let that idea slide, apparently.

""Yes.  Craving curry?""

""I can't tell you how long it's been since I had a proper beef curry.""

""But you must have the recipe.""

He was grinning.  ""It isn't the same!  You of all people would understand that.""

""And lucky for you, I do.  Let's get your luggage, then.""  She took Orli's carry-on from him, touching his shoulder (probably in sympathy for the shadows under his eyes), and led the way outside.  

The humidity (the same wet heat from when Dom had disembarked, only, he'd forgotten by now) bathed them in a sudden blast as the outer doors admitted them to the night.  It was raining cheerfully in fat drops, and all the lights of the parking lots and beyond flashed choppily off a ubiquitous reflective surface.  Walking <i>inside</i>, Dom thought fuzzily, he was travelling from the outer world into some smaller bubble-universe, and the rules were probably different here, and he wished he'd read up a bit more beforehand.  And that short walk out of the airport had felt a greater distance than any amount of time on a plane.

He let his head nod down, but Billy reached around and caught his chin neatly.

""How 'bout now?  Tired now?""

Dom declined to answer, only pushed his bags into the back of the champagne-coloured van.  Then hauled his pillow around and bundled him into the bench seat in the back, and pushed him down, and flopped over into Billy's lap.  Who grunted, but didn't protest, and just petted his hair a little and settled back sighing and fastened both their seatbelts as he could.

*

""Dom won, though,"" said Billy loudly, overhead.  ""He's been asleep since before the car started.""

""He sleeps when he reaches a new place,"" said Viggo, ""and it's a good idea.  Finding the tare of wherever you are, and resetting yourself to match.""

""Well, he's going to match my lap again this time, too.""

A Viggo laugh and an Orli laugh.  ""He does it on purpose.  What will he do without you?""

Dom protested their conversation with an annoyed groan and snaked his arms around Billy's waist.  Without him, indeed.  He had no intention of letting Billy out of reach until Dom was well-rested again.  Or afterwards, either.  But the car, the van was stopping, backing up and halting, and Viggo's unintelligible cry (either Vig-nonsense or Japanese) cut off when the door slammed.

""We barely fit in that space,"" said Billy, sounding taken aback.  ""I mean, <i>really</i>.  Dom, look.""

With effort, Dom lifted his head, pushing off against Billy's knee and shoulder to keep himself upright.  The parking space - what the hell? - had <i>walls</i>, like a cage, which seemed only inches away from the sides of the car.

""Uh, are we trapped in here, or what?""

""Viggo escaped well enough.  And is probably already on his second helping of curry.""  He made a drawn-out blink, as though his eyes hurt, and said, ""Let's go.""

They pinballed in slow motion up and out the front door on the right - past the meter, which was controlling a set of tire spikes beneath the van.  Followed the others into the restaurant on the corner, assimilating this dark alley and the high, neon-topped buildings all around, and the busy street barely a stumble away.  Vending machines right there, different than even the ones they'd seen in Tokyo.  Rain still plopping down, wet sidewalks, the odd covered gutters that Dom was afraid to step on, and frigid air conditioning as they passed through narrow automatic doors.

Inside was bright, painful light, quite cramped, and with a few other people already seated in the hard-backed booths.  They looked askance as the group of foreigners crammed themselves in around one table, with Viggo and Maxine on one side and everybody else on the other.  Dom had never been happier to be in the middle ~ either way he slumped, there was a nice shoulder to lean on.  There was a lot of fussing over poorly-translated menus and Dom was content to let Billy or somebody else order for him.  Maxine did the honours and relayed requests for everyone when the waiter appeared, and he had <i>such</i> a grateful look when she spoke in Japanese.

""He hasn't been studying, I think,"" she grinned at the rest of them when the young man had taken their orders back to the kitchen.  ""I know him, through a friend of a friend, and he ought to understand English well enough.  But it seems he doesn't remember me.""

""How do you know Viggo, then, Maxine?"" Billy asked curiously.

""Ah, we rebels have to stick together, right?"" she kept smiling, impishly proud.

""Maxine and Bill are missionaries, and blacklisted by more than one government for 'subversive' peace-seeking activities.""

Dom sat up straight, interjecting a respectful ""Wow!""

""Our paths crossed while I was travelling here, and they've come to my rescue several times,"" Viggo continued.  ""The very best of people.""

Maxine shook her head fondly.  ""Speaking of the best of people, how is Henry?""

""He's very well.  He would have come with us, but he decided to keep with his part-time job instead.""  Viggo closed his eyes. ""I'm so proud of him, in everything he does.""  

He produced recent pictures from his wallet then, which, along with his ruffian-like driver's licence photo, kept everyone's interest until the waiter returned balancing an enormous tray of oblong plates.  There was hardly room on the table for all those plates, particularly Viggo's, which seemed positively mountainous.

At Dom's stare, he explained: ""It's the Challenge Curry.  If I eat the entire thing, it's free.""  Then he and Maxine chirped something in Japanese, and he tucked in enthusiastically.

On Dom's plate there was a circular mass of white rice - the short-grain, sticky kind - and a small lake of curry sauce, swimming with sliced beef and melted cheese.  Part of a soft-boiled egg appeared to be sunning itself on the rice beach.  It smelled too good to hold off for long, but it seemed he was missing part of the process.  He glanced at Maxine uncertainly.

She smiled, or perhaps continued to smile.  ""Itadakimasu,"" she enunciated.  ""It means, 'I humbly partake.'""

""Takakimas?"" Dom fumbled.

""Ii-ta-da-ki-maas'."" She said again, letting him parrot her until he had it right.  

""Itadakimas'!""  Billy and Orlando, although they had already started into their curries, mumbled it along with him.

No one spoke for a while after that, only gasping occasionally when a mouth was burned.  Until Orlando surrendered, groaning, ""I can't <i>believe</i> how filling this stuff is,"" and pushing away his plate.  Viggo made a cat smile and appropriated what was left of Orli's vegetarian curry, mixing it in with his own.

Dom, still going strong, cheerfully scooped a bite out of Billy's curry.  ""This is the chicken?""

""Yeh, you uncivillised--  HAH!""  Billy's spoon clinked when he helped himself to Dom's plate.  ""Now, that's not bad.  I'd get that next time.""

""Hey, I was saving the egg!""

""Mix it in!  It's good that way.""

""...Ah, all right.  Hmm, a bit more of this, then.""  Dom had another spoonful off Billy's, then took some from Viggo's plate for each of them, since Billy couldn't reach.  ""Wanna try the beef and cheese, Orli?""

Yawning, Orlando shook his head.  ""Hobbits!""

Maxine mopped up her last bit of sauce with her last few grains of rice and sat back, laying her spoon neatly across the top right side of her dish.  ""Goch'sousama,"" said she, and Dom yawned hugely in the middle of mouthing the string of syllables back.

<b>Starring:</b> Dom, Viggo, Billy
<b>Disclaimer:</b> The way that I can imagine is not the true Way.
<b>Notes:</b> Written to soothe us after the 2004 election.  Originally posted <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/vensre/74019.html"">here</a>.
I wrote the stuff before the pagebreak, and Puddle continued it.  
Thanks to <lj user=""ingve9""> for the most apt title.


<lj-cut text=""This is not Dom's country, for all that he lives here."">~:


It is three o'clock when his mobile vibrates in his pocket and makes him spill his drink.

""Shite.  Evey, love, hand me that towel, could you?""  He opens his phone, mopping himself off.  ""'Ello?""

""Still watching?"" comes a familiar voice.

""Viggo.  'Course I am, mate.""  There is a little stillness down the line that delineates their mutual distaste, backed by a slightly delayed echo of the same station playing in two far-apart houses.  Dom glances at the redredred map and scoffs.  ""That cunting idiot for another four years, yeah?  Sean's gonna be <i>pissed</i>.""

""And he's not the only one.""  Dom's mind eye shows him Viggo, in one of his political shirts, probably, sitting folded over on himself and with a crease between his eyebrows.  And Sean, at his local campaign headquarters, exhausted and-- no.  He revises it to Sean asleep at home, not worrying even in dreams, and wishes it true.  ""They're passing these bans, you know?""  Viggo sighs.  ""I voted early today.  California went to Kerry, obviously.  Seems they need more of us in Ohio.""

""Wish I could've done something.""  Dom makes eye contact and nods his thanks as Jorge passes him yet another can and smiles grimly. It feels lovely against his forehead, drawing out a tiny portion of the heat of Hawaiian November that has been collecting inside his skull.  ""All this political stuff.  Makes me nauseous.  We had t' put the criers to bed an hour ago.  ...Wish I could've actually <i>done</i> something.""

""You do what you can.  We all do.""

This is not Dom's country, for all that he lives here.  ""Get me out o' here, man.""

""There's a six o'clock to LAX, if you're interested--""

""It's still America--""

""And I can join you on the transfers towards Glasgow.""  Viggo waits a moment.  ""Does that strike your fancy?""

Cool weather, sane government, and Billy.  The thought's enough to make this headache unclench a little from around his brain.  ""Yes,"" he says slowly, and with great satisfaction; he has a week, at least.  ""Yes it does.  ...What're you wearing?""

Viggo just laughs and books their flights.


:~:


""Let's play a game,"" Billy suggests with that thing he gets in his voice when he <i>knows</i> something.  They've only just got into his flat and opened their beers, but Dom's been awake for hours and hours (so has Vig), and he doesn't know the exact number of them-- obviously more hours than it takes to count the millions of people in Ohio.  By hand, are they doing it, now?

The extra factor is Billy, though.  He's being his old enigmatic self.  He knows something that Dom doesn't know.  So Dom glances at Viggo, but garners no clues, for he's only inspecting a set of his own black and whites on the wall.  Dom wonders if, in transit between Billy's car and the flat, Billy caught some bit of news through a secret source.  He squints.  ""I can <i>tell</i> you have a secret, you know, Bill.""

Billy widens his eyes comically.  He looks insane, as per usual.  ""Nothin' you both don't know already.  We're goin'e go around and guess what each others' most hated... ehm... ye know.  Most despised trait of Bush's is.  'S'at sound reasonably--""

""Yours is the environmental policy,"" Viggo cuts in, tossing his gaze over his shoulder at Billy.  ""An' I know what yours is, too, Flower.  Where's Ali?""

""Flower?"" Dom grins and mutters bemusedly, ""That's a new one, Mudpile.""  He sets his elbows on his knees, looks down at himself and thinks: this is how Viggo was sitting when he rang from Cali.

""Mudpile?"" Billy asks of them, grinning.  ""Ehm, Ali's walkin' Horatio, she left a note on the fridge.""

Viggo stalks over to the couch Dom's sat on and trickles down.  He smirks at each of them in turn.  ""... Horatio?""

""Least Horatio's his real name,"" Billy says.

""Yours,"" Dom says, picking his head up to look at Viggo, ""is the war.""

""Well.""  Viggo puts his back against the sofa.

Dom looks up at Billy, who is sitting in the chair next to the couch frowning.  Frowning straight at Dom, no less.  ""How does Viggo know yours and I... I don't... think I do.  'Nless it's somethin' we've already said.""

Dom and Viggo share a look, but when Dom's eyes rake back over to Billy's, he regrets.  ""It's...""  Dom sighs.  ""You know me, Bill, come on.""

Billy stares.

""We have not discussed it thus far,"" Viggo supplies.  ""You know this, Billy.  You said you knew it before <i>we</i> even said anything.""

""Yeah, but... I...""  He shakes his head in a contained way.  ""Keepsecondguessingmyself,"" he says under his breath, then: ""His stance on gay marriage?""

Viggo chuckles deeply.  Dom elbows him and nods, smiling softly, at Billy.

Some little lines spring up around Billy's eyes and brows that aren't normally there.  They say: <i>Are you guys...?</i>

""Look what you did, Mudpile,"" Dom whines.  ""Made Billy think we're shagging!""

Viggo laughs harder, and Billy joins in a little.  Dom motions for him to join them on the sofa-- pats the space between himself and Viggo-- and Billy sets his beer down so he can dart right over.

Dom wraps around Billy immediately, both arms, his head and even one of his legs, and Viggo comes in a few seconds after.  Billy lets his head stack on top of Dom's and puts his arms around them both.

""Guess I'm kinda glad,"" Billy quietly utters, the mood instantly morphed by the tone of his voice, ""things turned out the way they did.""

""<i>Why</i>?"" Dom squeaks, because he is suddenly shot through the heart with dread-- is this <i>Billy</i>?

Billy laughs.  ""Because I get te see you guys, ye great English idiot!""

Viggo snorts; Dom presses his head further into the side of Billy's neck.  A moment of silence comes and goes.

""Ye wouldn't be here if Kerry won,"" Billy says like it's the saddest thing imaginable and like Dom and Viggo are not in any way allowed to continue that train of thought.  But if Billy wanted that, he should've changed the subject straightaway.

Just as Dom opens his mouth to spill out something he's not even cognitively recognised as English yet, Viggo says, ""No, we'd've flown you down to LA to make you party with us, Billy.""

""Really?""

Dom wants to answer that, at least, but Viggo beats him to it again.  ""You don't really doubt me, do you.""

""No.  What were you gonna say, Dom?""  Billy curls his warm hand around Dom's waist.

""I'm kinna glad, too,"" Dom provides expediently.  ""How I've missed Britain.  Scotland in all its cold, pissing rain throughout November glory.""

""The sky only weeps for you, Dom.""  There is a smile in Billy's voice.  ""You've got'e spend more time here, else it'll just be sunny all winter long.""

When Viggo disengages and rolls to his feet, Dom feels part of his security disconnect and walk away with him.  He's only going to the loo, but.  Billy wraps his unused half around Dom; Dom very carefully tugs his chest away from the full-frontal contact Billy wants.  His heart is making too much of a racket in there; Billy's heart might call the landlord and complain.  Once it's more or less taken care of, Dom's muscles are quivering but he finds the words:  ""That's the point, silly Billy.  I've been craving this place.  And you know what happens when I crave someplace.""

""Yeah, you usually tend te crave quietly.  When's the last time ye went te New Zealand?  And you've not been here in over a year, ye know.""

""But it's--""

""I named my dog after you.""

Dom shifts his head slightly.  There isn't much else he can do.  ""... I... thought you named him Horatio.""

""Horatio the best mate.""

""Did you tell Ali why you named him?"" Dom asks before he can process.

""No.""

Oh.

Only now does Dom smile, because Billy's just restored some of Dom's lost (kidnapped, tied bound and gagged, stabbed, died a horrible death, thankyouverymuch Mister Bush) optimism and, as it turns out, there actually are things more important than American politics.

Dom relaxes and dips and melts and lets his chest touch Billy's.

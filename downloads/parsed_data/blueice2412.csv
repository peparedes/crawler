"event","wow it is amazing how when u are mad about something you can just get on the journal and write even if you never get on and write. for example tonight. today was ok and it was a good day untill about 9:30pm. between haveing plans and making last minute plans for the 15 mins i had before i was supposed to be else where it was last minute and i was givin a guilt trip about leaving the persons house who i was at for about 15 min and had to leave even though i was there for almost 30 min instead while holding up other poeples plans plans and then getting the cold shoulder yet again. i am tired of ny and its ""you are too good of a friend"" to date and the well i prefer you friend who is here instead. i miss chicago where i had friends who were intrested in me. knew when someone who was a good person and were friends with them instead of the people who didn't do anything. it is weird been around the would and friends online are thanking me for defending the country and people at home who don't know me and them friends tend to be to busy for me. i know i seem the same way but i have limited time in the area i whish i was able to stay and see everyone. i just want to move to chicago. i miss ashly, jessika, jessica, will and ali. they had fun and we all had a good time. i almost want to move to chicago when i am out of the navy. i have a great skill being set up so i will have a job almost anywhere but people in chicago exp. the girls actually liked to hang out with me and were intrested in ME!!! of while i will get there some other day. just glad to be home safe. a slight buzz at a top speed of 105 mph on back roads and 85 to 90 on the S bends was not the best idea exp when i was racoons crossing the roads. tomorrow i go back to va and i will have to see when i come to ny again. i am planning on going to chicago and visit jessika and her mom and ashly again. i miss the hospitality they gave a total stranger. maybe i will go there instead of my next time. well i miss yall and i will talk to you all soon. phone texting jessika at 2:51 am. talk to yall soon.

"event","Ok before i get into other issues, tonight was a overall good night. left home about 6:00pm and went to visit ams at work but she wasn't there and i didn't get to talk when she got there, she had to work, then me and shawn went x-mas shopping and actually got something done. then i went to the bar with my parents and had a couple of drinks and then went bowling. plad three games while still drinking and then got home about midnight. only 3 drinks all night and 2 of which were free. and then talk to my stepfather about letting someone move in for a while if needed. not sure how that is going to go, i have to talk to him about it more later. well i want to make one of my good friends happy, i would do almost anything in the world for her. i would not mess up my whole world for her but i will do what i can to help her. right now looking for a car and tring to get it so she has a place to stay if needed. On the the next topic. lately i have been getting more and more depressed. i think i am falling for someone i have had a crush on since the 10th grade and yet i know it will never happen. but i want it to so much oh well i am leaveing and it is not worth haveing a relation ship while i am about 650 to 750 miles away. i just don't know what to do. well that and i am getting depressed about the fact that i am about to leave ny again soon. i have been here for almost 20 days and i have seen brian terri and ashly once, seen a lot of shawn and amber and treasea and seen my cousin shae only once. not seeing everyone i want to and i talk to my friends from chicago, aaron online, ashly only 4 times and jessika the night i got home. i wish i calk to to jessica B. and jessika more. i talk to jessika's cousin more then her which is kinda uncool oh well i guess she has moved on and forgot about me well not sure what else to write, right about now. got home and drinking more, parents were complaining that they bought me a 6 pack and only drank about 1/4 of one of the bottles since i got home on the 6th of dec and it's now the 22 of dec. no i am not a big drinker even though i have drank about 7-9 drinks at the bars, that is still not alot, 4 at panarama, 1 and pulse,3 at rose garden and 1 at the mug, 4 of those drinks were free to me, 2 for being in the navy one for being where i was and one for being my mothers son. well i am going to go and hope that things will workout for me. and i will talk to yall later

"event","not sure what to say, in a weird mood. something is not right i can feel it. and it is not ducky this time, not sure who it is this time i just know something is off. i can sence it. i will leave it at that for now. anyways there is not to much going on lately. as a few friends that i talked to from home know about one of my situtations, why is that word involved. there is a purpose behind it. a shield or wall of protection that comes to someone with useing that one small word, even if it is some what long. i want to know why that word is being used. brian and terri you know what i am talking about. at least i think you do. i think u are the only two who may possibly know what i mean. well i have to go and get ready for bed. talk again. ad again shitty typing. sorry again bri

"event","Well I am not really the master. But i am getting veryfar with the editing of my LiveJournal thanks to schismatic. I got the fixed background idea from her and she told me where I could find the information to set mine up. So to her I say <B><I> THANK YOU!!! </B></I> Besides that I have not done to much lately. *Laughs* Well not to much lately. Just been going to class and today i was thrown into a room with a RIOT CONTROL AGENT AKA CS GAS AKA TEAR GAS!!!!! Can we say FUN FUN? Ummm No I am not able to say that. Five hours later with about a 30 min COLD shower and my eyes are still burning. Cold so your pores don't open and cause your skin to burn even more. However besides that I am starting a new website to use the Web Page design program that I have. Got it to edit this site but it didn't require a program just about 10 min of reading and searching the FAQ's. Well that is all that I have for now. I will probable update again later tonight if I have time.

"event","last nights writing,
 I know it's been a while since my last update but i have been keeping very busy. Monday i meet a great girl(E) while at the mall(for the 3rd day in a row). that thursday me her and her friend(J) meet and played pool.. that next night me her(E) (J)(AR)(AS)(P) all went to a dance club about and hour south of where i am. got back and in bed about 3
:30am and work up about 7:45 am to get ready for the renisance faire. we all dressed up in chainmail and walked around till about 4pm then left and went and rested to get back up a few hours later to go bowling with (E), and (AR). dropped off (AR) and she brought me back to where i had meet them and parked my car and talked from about 1am to about 3:30am. very worth it. then about5:30 am went to bed to get about about 8:15 to go to (E) grandparents for a family party. (AR) also went with us.. We played a little ping pong for about an hour then went swimming for about 4-6 hours and played some water games for about 1-2 of those hours. while in the pool her little cousin asked her a question and i didn't really hear it but i heard her say ""I don't know your have to ask him."" so she swam to me and asked me if i was her boyfriend. didn't say yes or no just ""i have only known her for about 3 days. after swimming played pool for about 30 and hung out till about 9pm. drove (AR) home and we talked and drove around for a little bit and she asked what i would have said if it was not for the family being around. well i told her i would have said yes and we drove around in circles for about and hour and a half brought her home around midnight and talked on the walkway for about 30 min before i left.



not from about midnight on sunday.

Monday we were supposed to go and play softball however when i got out of class she told me she could not talk and her car broke down in the middle of an intersection. so i wanted to go help her out but she said she was fine and had i ride and she would call back later. so i went out and played pool for about an hour and about 7:15 called her and her and she didn't answere her phone. said tuesday that she saw a movie monday night and was out till one and was going out with friends. i was having a horible day since monday morning and had duty tuesday so i would not be able to go and hang out with her. so tuesday night i wrote the top paragraph around 11pm because i was stuck up and was thinking about her all day. then today i was woke up really earily after bing up till about 1am in the morning for watch and forgot something and teacher sounded like he was going to be a dick. he turned out to be really cool though so i can't complain about him. was basicly told that i will not be allowed to take the MR# test because i got screwed over again like in march. so was madder and missed pt which is good because i was talking to the chief about the test. then had to clean till 5pm and finally got off about 5:30 pm went out. called (E) to she what she was doing now that we were going out and she said she could not talk at first then i played pool till about 9pm and about 10 pm i called her again and some guy answered and said that he had not her that name. seeing at it was her cell i called again and people just fucking with me on the phone. saying she was tied up litterly and say didn't seem like she wanted to tal and after she said they let her go i hear her asking for her pants back. just what i wanted to here thinking she was going to call me when she was going to go out. then i had some guy call about 3 min after she was getting ready to leave the other people saying that he was her boyfriend and she didn't want me to call her anymore after she just said that was not the case. so i told him if she said that i would believe it so he let me talk to her and she said that she was dating him since monday after we started going out at 10:30 pm sunday night. not even 24 hours and she said that he was not there while she was tied up and what not. so i don't know what to believe but it seem like when ever i actually like like someone to the point i want to be around them that they find the worst way to say they don't give a shit about me and didn't want to hurt me. so have your friends say they just fucked you 6 times and them a min later have you new boyfriend call me and to stop harassing you is the best way to let me know u don't really want to date. whatever. so pissed off i got back and went rollerblading on base. got pulled over by the cops just about the time i was not so pissed off anymore at about midnight and it's not 1 am and i am still pissed off about her and the fucking cop saying i can't roller blade. right now i just want to crawl in a hole and die. and on top of all the shit tonight i tried to call my friend before the whole episode with (E) to see how ams was doing. she went in for segury on the 17th to have a plate put in her head where her skull was missing from the crash and i got no answere and the answereing machine was diffrent so i want to know how she was doing. so i think i will be buld from stress by tomorrow morning. well i am going to go tos and turn while i TRY to sleep. and am stuck woundering about ams and thinking about how i really like (E). for the friends who want to see pics of me and the group of 9 who went to the renissance faire let me know and i will e-mail you a copy of the pics.

talk to yall later, ther is if i don't have a anurism from stress and shit.

night @ 1am

     at the bar after eating they had the aribic men at the bar with the white robes. not all people wear the robes only certian people. but the one guy was watching porn his cell phone. i though that was funny as hell.had a list of things i wanted to buy however i didn't get anything that was not essential. i spent about 70 dollers yesterday. i can't believe that. however i plan on spenting about 3-7 hundered tomorrow or the next day.

"event","what a great day it started out by me feeling like crap. got out of work at 8:45am and when to andrea's to set up printer but she was away to college. her friend katie was there though. so me and katie went to the beach and hung out till andrea got back took katie to airport. feeling 100% better by now. went home hung out with the guys and took a nap went back to andrea's watched house of 1000 coprses and d-loaded printer drivers. oh ya i had about 5 shots of apple puckers in about 5-10 min the 2 mixed drinks of orange vodka and orange juice. (distraction/good mood promoter). stoped drinking about 11:30 and then finished d-load the file. (will leave a bit out). then left about1:45 in the morning to go to work. that is where i am now. it is about 2:30 going to do a bit then go to bed. that is it for tonight.

"event","going back a while, thursday night party at my appt, andrea ignored me almost all night to hang out with nick then talked to him, he said he would back off that next wed, sunday had plans to see andrea but she was in maryland till monday afternoon. went out with nick monday night, i talked to her that night and said that we could hand out tuesday night. told her tuesday about 3:#0 i would be over about 6:30 to pick her up and she took off with nick. talked to her at 7:16 and they said they were on there way to bring her home. went from va beach to above newport news and ate. talked to her 8:45 and they said they just finished eating and were going to be about an hour but got there about 9:30 and then he stayed to watch a movie didn't get to spend anytime alone. then talked to her, she promissed that wednessday, the next day we would hang out alone. wednessday she invites him over, and after saying all night we could go see a movie alone. about 10 mins after the last time i asked she decided she didn't feel like going anymore. so i told her that she can forget about the 4 years of friendship, that it was over and left a note saying that she can call me when her and nick are done. and i am going to stick to that too. when i left all my stress went away. besides what i heard about this morning. which i am thinking is ture but i am not sure.

will finish later

ok i am back. was wrestling and after done almost passed out. i think i am back to typing condition.

but anyways going more towards my slef. i ate a small lunch on tuesday, tuesday night i had 2.5 oreo's wed i had about 1 put of speggitti(still dizzy and can't spell, and today thursday i had a small dinner. drinking coffee alot lately also. but today after my stress left i got moved to carpender shop and will be there till next thursday. i am enjopying the lack of stress from up there. so even though all i did in this entry is complian and sorry to all for u for just complaining, i am happier not that the ny drama that come down is now gone again for the most part. well that is it good night.

I told someone that i had to talk to them. i don't want to wait. but it is important enough that i want to talk face to face. my life may be making another big change. sounds like that might happen no matter what is said. but only time will tell. well that is it for tonight hopefully i will be able to sleep ok. well iu will update later. c-yall later

"event","well no one ever writes on livejournal anymore i think that they all forgot about it. but then again i write and more either. nor do i call many people. yet i have told a few that i talk to that i am going home the end of this week for a week and a half. i doubt that anyone will even read this. if they do they only read what others write, not write themselves. well now u can't say that i didn't say anything about me comming home. if u want to hang out i will try to see everyone but make sure that u give me  call to make sure i know when u are free. talk to yall later.

If they are saying shit about me i hope it is at least true. well besides that there is not much going on. i noticed that noone writes in this anymore. i try to check it every now and then but never anything new in it. well i just thought that i would say hello to everyone. i tend not to talk to anyone anymore unless i call then so i think it is almost a final good bye. i will call a few people here and there and when i come home i will see the people who i think would like to see me. other then that i am just going to enjoy the freedom there is in ny. no one from home realizes how well they have it. every where here u need to pay to park or have a parking pass. want to go to the beach??? pay to park. try parking someplace else and get towed. no ny isn't the best and there are costs to things but it quit peacefull areas up there are not down here. i am still searching. well is u want to know how things are going. u know my number and if u don't reply to this asking me for my number and i will give it to you. well it's almost 10:30 at night and i only had to work 2.5 hours today so i am going to the beach. rollorblading so it's free. well i will talk to ya if ya call. c-ya and enjoy the area up there while u can."

"event","well i meet the girl meg that i have been talking to for a while not. thought maybe i would be able to help her get rid of her ""friend with benifits"" who she was only friends with benifits with because she thinks he will leave his fieance and go back to her. well after we meet she still went back to ""see"" him. so i am giving up on helping her. i don't know her well enought to worry about her that much. not worth any stress on me. so when i come up to ny i may still go out and visit but i am not sure. i will see how things go. and seeing as though she doesn't have internet i don't have to worry about her reading this. so that is about all that i new. i have to get going. give me a call if ya get a chance if i haven't talked to ya in a while. that is it for today.

Yesterday i babysat, then my mom dropped me off at my dads, and i went down to Tina's cuz i figured i should visit her, and Charles and Kenny would eventually go there, cuz Kenny is like in love with Gary, and he cannot go a day with out him....for serious, and at first it was Me, Tina, Gary, and Mary...then a few minutes later Rita showed up , then Charles and Kenny, Charles hit up his boi Ronnie i think, to get a ""sizzle"" and when Ronnie was on his way we were sittin outside....and then Ashley dropped off Jimmy and Mike, now as soon as Mike got outta that car....Charles just looked at me then said ""there's your man"", i got sooooo pissed, cuz that shit was like 6 months ago, and he's still bringin it up....but whatever

                     off that subject
okay I was readin Lisa's Lj and it just made me remember why i stopped goin to that fuckin school, cuz that is all the people do is talk shit, and then when confronted deny it.....it is fuckin stupid as hell, and like i dunno people do need to get lives and mind their own god damn business, cuz if they did that they could work on fixing their problems, and stop talking shit bout people who are just trying to be happy for once....



well thats all for today

have a fantastic((hopefully drama free)) day everyone!!! Muah"

In fact, the only thing in Marijuana that kills brain cells is the smoke itself or loss of oxygen while smoking alot of it during one sitting.

Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up (so broken up)
And I give up (I give up) 
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up (breaking up)
I feel like giving up (like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one who gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Here I go so dishonestly
Leave a note for you my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one
My only one
My only one
You are my only, my only one"

"event","** Well.... today was an eventful day, first off i ask my brother to drive me n tina to the bus stop, he does, n then he decides that he'll just take us to school instead, he does, then he tries to show off and hits a car parked out in front of a church, note that he does not have neither his permit nor his license, and the cops come, he ends up with 3 tickets for careless driving, no proof of insurance, and for driving w/out a license. He also got his car impounded, and the owner of the other car is sueing.... so yeah. so i felt guilty all damn day cuz it was my idea for him to drive us any where... but i didn't make him drive like a jackass... well i dunno... and i have the whole other drama thing goin on with Frank n Billy, so well i dunno, i'm done tho.... buh bye"

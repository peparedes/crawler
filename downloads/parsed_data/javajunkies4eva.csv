"event","Okay, only the second time I've posted here.  No one seems to read xanga anymore so I had to resort to this.  Its cool.  I cant wait for the next eppie of GG.  If you're reading, read my fics:

Victory is Lovely       http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1961379/1/

A mighty Quarrel       http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2132582/1/

So there.  I dont know what else to say.  Drew asked me for my number in English.  He was only joking and I know it.  The only two times a guy has asked me out or for my number were both jokes.  Sad, haw?  Corey Batz is the other.  He was sitting a few feet away.  Anyway, I'm starting to have my faith in the likeliness of the c/o 2006.  I like all the people I sit near in English.  We talk all the time, not to mention make fun of Woodshank.  Its awesome.  I gotta go now.  Post later."

"event","Yes tonight is the premiere!  I'll copy my post from xanga:

Ahaha.  The Gilmore Girls premiere is tonight!!!  i am SO excited.  Melo and Chels are coming over to watch it on my big screen tv (its as long as I am tall) with surround sound (oh the love I feel with my power obsessive parents.  I really think our neighbors hate us because when we watch movies the ground shakes).  Chels  might not be able to come if she doesnt finish her home work, which saddens me.  We'll just do a certain thing with the confetti without you, then, wont we?!  Yes, we will!!  Luke and Lorelai sleep together after their first date, and Lor goes down into the diner the next morning in Luke's flannel.  Its full of people and no one seems particularly interested in her and Luke's relationship, which frustrates her.  Then at the town meeting everyone gets into this huge discussion about them saying that if they break up(which is likely cause look at Lor's track record with men) the town will have to choose between the Dragonfly and the Diner (which would seriously be a hard choice cause who could live without Luke's coffee and Luke himself?  But who could live without Lor's jokes and humor and personality (Lor herself) and Sookie's food?).  This is weird because theyve been pushing them together all of the last four years and now they dont want them to be together.  Weird.  What I want is for Luke to get Lorelai pregnant.  Oh, lil versions of Luke and Lorelai running around!!!  Then I'll steal Luke for myself.  Hehehe ::Evil grin::

The star wars DVDs come out today.  Im sorry everyone, but Im a star wars geek!  Screw the Star Trek geeks!!!  Im asking for them for my birthday (the DVDs not the ST geeks).  I cant wait.  I love Han and Leia.  Theyre the perfect couple and theyre so funny!

School sux.  Its boring and I have a low grade in Chem (nothing lower than a high C) but Im passing all of my other classes.  I have 100% in miss woodshanks class.  An a in spanish.  An a or b in history.  An A in Drama.  An A in math.  Yay.  Fun.  Junior year is going as planned.

My birthday is coming up soon!!!  I am the most excited person ever.  Plus, the fourth eppie of Season Five airs on my birthday!

I hate Ms Wigley.  She deserves to die.  She's evil.  She didnt cast me in the fall play cause she hates me, but I got ASM.  If I dont get cast in the musical, Im going to stage manage it.  Hopefully.  The play's a bit funny.  Not hilarious, laugh out loud, rolling on the floor laughing funny, but a good chuckles worth funny.  There's a neat twist at the end that I think is great.

Im done now.  I'll post later or tomorrow about how great the premiere was.

There ya go.  Im going now.  Again."

Hello life. I'll take romance with a side of cheese please. 

And that's him. He's on the plane now waiting to take off. Time to freak out lol :)"

"event","I love going back and reading my old entries. I would like to point out how much of an immature brat I was. However, I do admire one thing I once was, I was never afraid to be me.

I want to say that I still have that quality but do I really? Now that I think about it I do HAHA It just takes different forms now. Mostly drunk/party me and me sober. That is kind of sober that I have a category dedicated to me being drunk. I wonder what I look like to other people then as opposed to me being sober or if there's any difference at all. I know when I'm sober I pretty much say whatever I feel and when I'm drunk I do the same but I also do whatever I feel too LOL Which normally translates into me taking my clothes off. In all fairness, alcohol makes me hot. Or maybe my suspicions are true and maybe I am an attention whore."

"event","It's late, and once again I can't sleep. It has nothing to do with stress or anything I just don't want to sleep. I have this feeling I'm going to miss something if I fall asleep. I'm not sure what I'd be missing since I am the only one awake in my lil' world but whatever. It is what it is.

The semester is almost over and I can't wait. Screw summer school. I don't care if it'll speed things along, I just want to breathe a little easier for a small period of time. I'm supposed to be graduating this semester with my associates. Not that an associates means anything to anyone but it means a lot to me. For a long time I didn't think I would even be able to go back to school but here I am doing what I would be doing if I didn't make bad choices at 18. 

I'd like to blame it on being young and foolish but that had nothing to do with it. I was just plain ignorant. I would love to be able to explain my life between 2003-2009 but I have no real explanations. I went from point A, some things happened and now I'm at point B. Granted, I'm over it but I kind wish I had those 6 years back. But at least it wasn't 20 something years like my parents so I should count my blessings. 

I love my life. I think it's beautiful in it's messy way. There's many things I need to change but I no longer see any rush. It'll all come in time and from the looks of it, I have all the time in the world. Over the past 26 years, I've been on the brink of death several times in my life and still kicking. I'm pretty convinced I'm going to live forever despite my wish to remain young and beautiful ::gag::"

"event","It's Easter weekend an like most fridays I spend it at numbers with my friends. I was having a hard time finding people to come with me but Chris finally did ^_^. Anyways, we get there early and sat there and just soak in the enviroment a bit and in comes this guy who sits near us. I'm thinking he's incredibly an a worthy target for this evening. I get up to go to the bathroom and when I come back Chris is talking with him. In my head I'm thinking, this is way to easy and of course I barge my way into the conversation just to make my presence known. And I got to talking to him and he seemed like a pretty cool guy. 

Being the blunt person that I am, I tell him how extremely cute I thought he was ever since I first saw him. To my surprise, he felt th same when he first saw me. Score! I'm totaly in the front door now to turn up the charm. So I got him to dance with me and it turns out he is not a he at all, he identifies himself as a she. My initial thought was, I'm totally attracted to a transgendered person how should I proceed? After some consideration, I thought what the hell, if I did love somebody and they decided down the road they were transgendered I couild totally do it. And I'm huge believer in be who you are and be great at it. I tell her my relevation and we danced for a bit and then went outside so she could smoke.

After  a very long conversation about our lives and what we been through. Some really deep shit too, things you don't tell someone you first meet lol. I discovered what a beautiful person she really was and that all this time I was trying to get her and she go to me first.  I was struck a million times over by cupids arrow. There's no way of letting him go.

But there's problem with me not letting go, she was leaving in the morning and the only reason she came out was because she missed her flight. It's funny that she asked the hotel people to the nearest gay and they mention numbers of all places not south beach or anything. NUMBERS where I was at. It's just amazing how a whole series of unfortunate events came down to this momen here. AND BY GOD I WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS NIGHT LAST AS LONG A POSSIBLE. 

The rest of the night was just us dancing, talking having a good time. Some fun points to mention from here til we left: he paid $100 to the dj to get them to play my favorite song, he bought us mixed cd's to remember the night, and lastly our last minute rush before exhaustion to the stage to start a frenzy of people dancing up there. The night had been amazing.

Chris and I were pretty tired so we left early and I was determined to spend as much time with her as possible before she left so I offtered to take her back to her hotel room. After I dropped Chris off. We a lil adventure finding an open gas station and locating his hotel room. The rest of the night was filled with great conversation until we passed out in the bed. No monkey business. I'd be lying if I said i didn't want to but in my head I thought she is not comfortable in her own body why would I even want to try to get her to bear it all for me causing further discomfort. But I was content how things were playing out.

I felt like cinderalla to enjoy her evening before the night was over and as far as I'm concerned this night was straight out of a fairy tale or movie.

I woke up about an hour before she did and I watched her sleep for a bit got to contemplate what this would've meant had it got a chance to actually become something. I learned that I could love anyone regaurdless of gender although I would always prefer man and will always consider myself gay but I would great distances for someone I cared for. I also learned that I could actually love again and just as strong as before if I chose to and I'm not the ice princess that someone once claimed me to be. And most importantly I learned that this person right next to me was beautiful inside and out and I'm going to be sad when she has to go.

After she woke up we got breakfast and talked for a little bit and the dreaded moment came when I had to go so she could gather everything together. With a big hug and a warm goodbye as slowly as I could out the door and to my car. I did not want to let her go at all and when I got inside my car I let it all out.

I was crying prety bad throughout the day. It wasn't soo much that she was gone, it was the fact how strongly this person impacted my life. I'm sooo thankful she walked in when she did and whatever happens I'll never get her forget her."

"event","Once upon a time, I knew what it meant to love someone. That feeling you get when he's around and the pain you feel when he's not. To go on for hours talking about nothing and everything while still being thoroughly entertained just because it was him. He left such an impression on my soul I could still feel him hours, days later. Even now, years and years later he still gets to me. I acknowledge and accept the fact that we will never be together again but I hope he knows how much I loved him with every fiber of my being. And til this day I still have soo much love for him. I will alway keep you on the pedestal far above anyone else until that one day I do meet someone. He will have to be extra special since you've set such high standards for any man to follow but I hope one day I could love someone as much as I did you. Perhaps even more."

"event","After today's lecture in human sexuality on attraction and love, I'm not really sure that if I'm actually mature enough to hold down a steady relationship. I know I have the capacity to actually make a committment to someone or something and follow through with it. But I don't know if I can relate to anyone on an emotional or intimate level. 

Let's start with emotional. This is not something I express very well. I don't have a problem saying what I am feeling but to actual show what I'm feeling I can't do. I suppose I'm afraid of emotions getting out of control and people not like what they see. I sure wouldn't like to see them take a hold of me. For instance, I do not handle anger well at all. I'm going to bottle everything up until it all explodes and do you think anyone will want to be around me at that point in time? I don't think so.

As far as intimacy goes, I don't think I've actually grasped this one at all. I can be attracted someone but at the same time I can't. I guess it's becase I'm afraid of being rejected if I become to attahed, I don't know.

So in writing all this crap, I now realize I have more fears than I had originally anticipated about relationships. This is interesting... not only am I bitter, I am also afraid. When will I ever let go...."

"event","I was laying in bed, contemplating my existence when I came to a certain conclusion. I noticed that I have a REALLY hard time investing myself in any sort of ""relationship"" with a guy. Granted. I'm very bitter but isn't it about time to get over it? And it's not just dating, it's sex too sadly. And part of that is the fact that I have to really like a guy before I enjoy sex otherwise I'll just get bored in the middle of it. 

Something is seriously wrong with me I think. Or maybe I'm just not wired that way but who knows. Lord knows how much I want sex and I've never really had a problem getting it but my brain is like NO DON'T DO IT. So not only can I not invest myself into a relationship, I can't even invest myself into a purely physical relationship. Seems a lil' odd to me because lemme tell you how ""bad"" I once was.. it was only a small period of time but I know I'm capable of being that way. 

I'm not sure why this even matters so much. But I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines watching everyone go through guy to guy. Why can't I have some fun?! >:-| I'm so jealous..."

"event","I thought I should post something positive since it's been like 4 years since I've actually posted on here and all that shit was pretty emo to begin with so.. ya. So what has happened since I last posted...

First off, I stayed with my ex for 2 more years after my last post and I finally said I had enough. That was July 1, 2009. And I know because I remember stuff like that. He even tricked me into meeting him one time after I cut all ties to him. We were at a park and all I could do was yell and scream because I was so pissed and when I was staring off into the sky, I saw a shooting star. Ain't that some fucked up shit? Here I am, mad as hell and the universe has the audacity to send some kind of message of hope and peace. I was trying to be mad GDI! Anyways, that's the last time I ever spoke to him... knowingly.

After that I started going back to school fall of '09 and let me tell you. Thanks to the GSA I've made soo many friends. I'm really glad I found such great people. I was going through some pretty rough stuff and all I wanted was to move on with my life and meeting these people really helped me through that. And I appreciate you all, more than you know. 

So life finally started to go into the direction I wanted. I gave dating other people a shot but I'm still pretty bitter and cynical when it comes to guys and lord knows when I'll ever move past that LOL.

I started working again in august '10. Two years after I left the workforce. I started working in a pharmacy of all places I wanted to be but that's ok. I get along pretty well with the people I work with and they all do their best to stay on top of stuff so work is pretty easy there. Plus, I'm making more than I ever have before which isn't bad at all. :D

In short.. life is amazing and I'm glad I'm still around to enjoy it. ^_^"

"event","So here I am, at my computer again feeling... lonely and tired. I feel like my life is such a fucking mess and not even a beautiful mess at that. No, this is like a fucking wretched mess that I have no idea what to do. 

First off, working in a pharmacy sucks ass big time. All I ever hear is shit, like no one is ever fucking satisfied then co-workers will come up to me and tell me how everyone is always complaining. If its not one things its another, I'm screwed either way. I can't quit, I don't really that I would want to anyway. I need this job, to get my life back together from the fucked up mess it was last year.

So how the fuck did life become so shitty anyway! And Dale... omg.. Dale! He's probably reading this right now, I would just like to say FUCK YOU! if you are 'cause this is my shit not yours and what I do while your asleep is no longer a concern of yours, that goes for when your awake as well. I'm fucking tired of shit! 

YOU GAVE ME HELL when I wasn't working and now all you do is play, like the same shit I did before, only now YOU STILL BITCH!!! BUT WHY!??! Wtf is wrong with you, you have no god damn right to bitch at me. I support your ass now and not even by choice now.

Once upon a time, I would've loved to support you. Though it may not show now, I really do love you at one point in time. But that love is gone. I don't even know what the fuck to call it anymore. To be honest I'm just plain fed up!"

"event","So here's the story..
I've been really depressed for awhile now. I think I'm feeling a lil' bit better about myself. There's just so many things I want, so many things I need to hear, and numerous amount of things I need to hear. But as always I'm alone... the one person who is around that could have been any help to me wasn't. That hurts... Not angry hurt but hits me really hard. I can't really talk to anyone about this because most of my friends don't like Dale in the first place. And I don't want to fuel anyone's anger. Contrary to Dale's belief, I don't get people to hate him. I barely talk about him to anyone in the first place, what would anyone have to go by what I say if I say nothing? 

So, I now retract my second statement. I'm still depressed... 
As much shit we've been through I still love him and even if I had to let go I don't know if I could. Though I know I have odd ways of showing love it's still love nonetheless and the strongest form I have to give. I just really don't understand. How he can continue being so mean to me. I know I've messed up countless of times in the past. Like I always tell him its my fault. Deep down I know that's not the total truth. Dale just happens to have more complaints about me than the other way around. So of course he's gonna hate me more. I'm not some fucking piece of Play-Doh you can mold into whatever you want!?!

I am me. James. Once a strong and unnerving person. Once so sure, now only broken. Shattered down into a million pieces through life. I'm finding it harder and harder to 'hold on' now that I'm writing this. Again, I'm wrong about yet another thing. Maybe I do whine to much, but how can that be if I don't say more than 100 words to anyone in one day. And with that being said (which is a very accurate statement btw) that's not enough words to complain enough.

So what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to pull myself together when I honestly don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I'm trying to take a giant leap blindfolded. I'm doing it but what the hell am I doing? Am I really sane? 

I just want to be happen again. The way I once was. Though I know things can never go back to the way things were but why I can't I be happy again? That's technically not trying to live in the past is it? And I'd rather not live in the past anyway. That would only be denying where I'm at now.

I'm 21, unemployed, unhappy, in a very 'shaky' relationship. This is nothing where I had planned to be. If things had gone how I had planned it a long time ago, I would be just about finishing up a bachelor's degree in either chemistry or mathematics. Maybe I'm just fooling myself. 

I guess I just push myself to hard. My parents 'had' high hopes for me, I don't know if they still do or not, I know my friends still expect me to be somebody. Just the other day Krystal was telling me that Erica and her were talking about I was one person they knew for sure would 'make it.' Maybe I just push myself to hard to live up to expectations of what people have for me. The real problem with that is I'm doing it blindly and I really don't know what people expect me to do.

I really started to think I was going somewhere for a minute. I know I put my education on hold so Dale and I could put together a stable home together. But I can't even keep that up right.

What the hell am I doing? Where the hell am I heading? Am I really going to be ok? I really wish I believed..."

"event","Well it's been a LONG LONG while since I've actually written anything serious in here so I just thought I'd jot down a few thoughts in my head.

I was going through my livejournal from the very beginning, and I had no idea just how depressed I was 'til I went over it again. I never thought of myself to be bitchy but those entries would suggest otherwise. Well, I can't say that my issues back then were resolved because they're not. I'm more at peace with myself though. I can say now that I love my parents and I'm sorry for everything I put them through, especially right before I graduated high school (that was bad!). I can also say that I'm over Chris but I never got the closure that I needed, nor do I know how to satisfy the need for it.

As far as my job hunt goes, it has been highly unsuccessful. I've had one interview all month and I was hoping they would call back sometime this week but I'm not going to hold my breath. Pretty soon I'm going to give up on trying to get a job in pharmacy because I don't think I've ever had this much trouble in gettin' a job ever and it's been rough. I did manage to put in yet another application to the Harris County Hospital Management people. THEY ARE ALWAYS HIRING!!! I would call and bug their ass to hire me but I can't seem to find their phone number. I do know where they are located though but I don't have the gas to go up there and put in a few words of please hire me please.

Anyways, today but I've been cleaning the house and it looks pretty good if I do say so myself. I don't think I've seen it this clean since  we came to look at this apartment. After that, I watched the Little Mermaid and opened my box of all my cherishable items from high school. Granted most of them are in my senior memory book which I have no idea where it might be which makes me  VERY VERY SAD! But at least I have my box!! I started reading all my letters and lookin' at what pictures I had left and it was fun. It brought back all those good feelings inside. 

Oh, and btw!!! It's been 32 hours since my last cigarrette!! I'm trying to quit. Today hasn't been to bad, yesterday was very stressful. I don't have any headaches today other than the one arising now that I've mentioned it. The funny thing is, is that I don't necessarily crave a cigarette but ratger there are times when I'm doing anything and I know I usually have a cigarette does that make since? Anyways wish me luck with that lol!!"

It's hard enough to find a good job let alone a specific good job. Or a specific job PERIOD! But I really can't complain much on that either since I've only been actively looking since Friday. But I NEED MONEY! I gots stuff to pay for plus there's a lot of shiny things that I want. 

BTW Did y'all know we have 5 weeks and 6 days 'til Christmas. I can't believe it's almost that time of the year. I actually feel I've accomplished something this year. Not that I didn't do much but at least I'm progressing and not degressing.

Dale has been searching around for houses and new apartments. Not that we are gonna move anytime soon but a house would be nice. My own backyard for my doggies and my own house with no apartment people ruining all the fun and crap. So one day...

Anyways did y'all know <div>JAMES is the #1 most common male name.<br>3.318% of men in the US are named JAMES.<br>Around 4064550 US men are named JAMES!<br>source <a href=""http://www.namestatistics.com/"">namestatistics.com</a></div>"

"event","So saturday was lots  of fun. I felt really good all night. All that alcohol Dale bought and all I had were 2 smirnoffs, a screwdriver and a shot of hot apple pie. So there's TONS of alcohol left. My sister and cousin said they were gonna come over and drink it all. Yeah right. At least we have something to hold on to for Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, St. Patrick's Day, Celebrate Good Times day. 

But none the less the night was full of laughs. Watching glitter get caught on Gnat's moustache for example hehe. I went as a gay cowboy, cut off  jeans, lots of glitter, purple cowboy hat and a purple  feather boa. It was bit nipply but an awesome costume because I was SHINYYYY!!! 

Anyways, I hate working at McDonald's it's not a bad job but shit I'm ready to get outta there!!!! All I have to wait for is my registration to work in the state of Texas and then it's all game baby WOOOOOOOO!!!!"

"event","So y'all best be listenin' good because God knows when I'll post next lol! So life's aight I suppose. I'm going to finish school Friday! Aren't y'all excited for me. Well if not well bleah, I am! Then I will take my certification exam in September and as soon as I pass which will be the first and only time I take the test (hopin' and prayin') I will be a pharmacy technician. Soon to be pharmacist! I'm so excited! I've learned so much on my extermship at Maxor Pharmacy. Although they limited what I could because it only applies to there pharmacy policies and procedures. So I did my best to keep up. They were going to higher me on an as needed basis but that doesn't sound like it was going to last to long. Because eventually all the people who had to take time off will be coming back so, I did my best... I think it was good enough. They were talking about how much they appreciated my help when they were shorthanded these past few weeks. Which has been ever since I started! Kinda sad but oh well... I'm learning.

Let's see... as far as life out of school, home life is pretty good. Dale and I have been endulging ourselves in Star Trek Voyagers! Yup we're geeks. But Voyager rocks because it's Voyager! Puppy and kitties are doing well too. Today Glitter started bringin' her food bowl to us to refill it. Isn't that so PRECIOUS! She is, she is my b a b y! Oh, and I've spent a lot of time playing with pokemon. Even though the game does get a lil' boring I can't STOP! Ice and Dark pokemon are fun.

Well soon, I'll be on lookin' for a job 'til I find out the results to my exam, after I take my exam so it'll be awhile. So back to the work force for me, doin' some stupid job."

"event","Well it's been a month since I lasted posted so now would be a good time to update. So NIT sucks, never go there. You'll never know what's going on and no one will tell you what's going on either. Apparently, I don't start my extermship officially until next monday. And I won't find out 'til friday. So I quit workin' for Wal-Mart for nothing at all. Waitin' all this damn time for nothing. But the time off is a beautiful thing but now I'm startin' to get really bored. Anyways, I'm going to do the best I can to start extermship saturday or maybe friday if I'm lucky. But I don't want to coach cheerleading no more. There's no money in it, and it's not worth the hair pullin' if I'm not going to bank so *bleah* all over that. If I have to I will go back though. Let's see... my animals are doing good. Jingle's leg doesn't look so bad anymore, Spot is the same ol' same ol', and Glitter, oh glitter. Some day  she'll be totally potty trained. GRR she'll get it soon, I have confidence in her.

Hmm... the apartment complex finally started gettin' their act together. They have yet to fix the leak in the air conditioner but I get a brand new dishwasher. How fun is that! It's so shiny and white, looks funny inside though. Oh well. Well, the sims are fun. I haven't played it lately because it's pissin' me off. Damn people won't keep their stats up all the time. Oh, and I found a pretty new background from the disney website of Belle. I love Beauty and the Beast. I want to get the Little Mermaid but it won't be released from the disney vault 'til 2008. Which sucks, but I wouldn't pay (or Dale won't pay hehe) $80 for it on E-bay so wait I shall. Well this has been an important update from me. Back to you Tom.

"event","Maybe I should start updating more... maybe.... Anyways, life is going pretty good. Tammy the apt manager is fucking awesome I hope she works there as long as we plan on staying here. Work is alright. I just got out of going to Dallas to go to San Marcus with Dale for Sebastian. Hmm... I'm glad I didn't get bitched out for work this time. That was mean! School is really easy... a lil' to easy... but as long as I learn what I need to know so I don't look like a jackass when I start working for a pharmacy. But other than that, I'm trying to find a second job. Hopefully a full-time position during night time. I would think it'd be easier to find a job at night but things look kind of dim right now. But hopefully I should get a second job pretty soon. Dale is hopefully going to get that job at Wal-Mart. That would be great. Let's see.. my pets are doing pretty good. My fish still look as a good as they did when I first got them almost 1 year ago. My turtle is looking better. He's got like shell rot or something. Dale and I have been trying to find ways to help him but nothing seems to be working, but I think we've got something set up for him that seems to be working but it's to early to tell. My cat Jingle is still crazy as ever. Always wanted attention thinkin' she owns this house or something. Well... typical cat I suppose. All in all life is swell."

"event","OMG GUYS!! So I was working for this girl who happened to help coach my old team mates and it was actually pretty boring. All they did was choreography so not much anyone else can do but clean up. Near the end, the squad I was help coaching was tumbling and I thought maybe it's time that I got back in the game. AND I FINALLY FUCKING DID IT! My double full twisting lay-out. OMG It felt so good! I forgot how it feels twisting so hard you feel weightless. Like the whole world is beneath  you and you're so high up the ground. My first one wasn't to pretty but my second attempt was gorgeous! OMG I'm soo excited! I started crying while I was walking to my car to go home. It just felt so good that I still had everything in me. SO I'M HAVING A FUCKING GREAT NIGHT!

"event","Well my god have I not written here in a long time. I guess now is as good as any to make an attempt to write something interesting. And since I've never been good expressing my feelings by talking, writing should help release everything within me.

Well I miss everyone, sorry to all of y'all for not bein' the greatest friend. I haven't talked to the gang in forever so y'all be expectin' to hear from me soon. 

Well life, life is just plain life. Nothing really to complain about much. I've been really lethargic lately. It all started a couple of weeks ago. I started to think about me. I don't know why I did but anywayz, I felt so disappointed in myself.

I look back at high school and I was this kid with so much ambition, hope and tons and tons of direction in my life. It was like the time of my life. I had my friends and I really never had much trouble with high school at all.

So now life comes, oh wonderful life. Don't get me wrong, I'm not disappointed how things turned out but I'm definitely disappointed in myself. All of what I had hoped to have accomplished seems to be stepping backwards, step by step.

Again I'm not saying it's a bad thing but who I am today is nothing what I expected I would be when I was in high school. Who would've known I'd be me now?

Ya my issues seem to be fucking things up real bad... So sorry if I haven't been the greatest boyfriend. 

Oh life, such stupid stupid stupid things keep happening. I guess you could say I'm a bit depressed but I don't know why? Though I am not becomin' what I expected to be I still can be everything I wanted to be soon right?

I don't really know what to do. I mean things really aren't bad it's just, I'm mad at myself. I feel so lost yet I have no reason to be.

::sigh:: Good news though guys! I quit smoking for I think 2 weeks now. so yay"

Now, there's no use for me gettin' upset about this situation since I have no control over it nor did I ever say any shit to begin with and nor do I plan on it. I refuse to submit myself to that level. I do not need anyone's approval to validate my reasons for my actions or decisions. 

I myself have a hard time accepting help from others. If anything, I only wanted to put some food on my parent's table since there was NONE. Count it. NONE in the fridge or cabinets.

"event","Keith Urban - You'll think of me

I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah

And you're gonna think of me

"event","So now the doors to Chris have been closed. Yes, finally total and complete closure guys isn't that great? Y'all know best of what I went through trying to get over him. Shit... I almost killed myself over it and waking up after all those pills thinking you die, it hurts. And now I know it's closed, someone who once brought me pleasure then brought me pain has now been rid in my life. No matter what, I will never think less of him, no matter how much pain he caused me because he did teach me a lot about myself. And I thank him so much for that. And if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be where I want to be, nor would I be the person I am today. I love Dale so much and I like what I have become today. Maybe one day, he'll move on and find that person who he's meant to be with and reflect on me as I do to him. But until then, I will wish him the best with all of my heart and soul. From the person I once was, to the person I am today, and to the person I have yet to become. So the room and my heart completely closes and now locked to only reflect upon as I choose. Never to haunt me again. I finally feel better about myself and so much has been relieved. And thank you guys so much for being there for me when I needed you. Erica, Patricia, Krystal, Rebecca. I love you guys!"

"event","Well yesterday was like the scariest day ever, I thought I might lose Dale. Well a whole bunch of tears were shed and now everything is ok so I'm really thankful for that. That's probably like the first time I prayed for anything in like several years. Crazy huh? It actually does work sometimes hehe (not meant to be offensive to anyone by the way). Court went ok I guess, got to meet Rob's family and stuff and talk to Lark and stuff. But ya... I missed out on Big Fish last night, felt so sick and passed out, so ya that's kewl.

But for those of you who don't know, my AOL screename got canceled for some odd reason so my new one is x0 PixieShine 0x, pixie shine from lady lovely locks ^_^. And those are zero's not o's. So ya..."

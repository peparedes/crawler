Today is September 3rd, 2005. Over the past 24 hours I've discovered that I can never be happy. Or satisfied. I'm sorry I call you so much. I know I'm annoying and you most likely hate me now. So I won't be calling you anymore. And thats all I really have to say. I could tell you about my day, but it really wasn't that interesting. And I don't have any plans for the rest of the week.

And that's that

Love,
Kevin Wade Shaw"

Today is August 17th (18th), 2005. First, I would like to apologize for making fun of Georgia's local music scene and Christian hardcore...evn though it's almost an oxymoron...and a joke. That's probably the reason you didn't call me back later. And I don't blame you at all. I did buy Travis some new shorts though--almost the exact same ones too. He seemed to like them enough. We watched Amelie tonight and it was wonderful. Before that, I went to TARGET(!) and guitar center and bought neat things that I really need...such as a three-in-one can opener...no joke. Yesterday I went to rehearsal  (because Travis needed a ride) and I saw Scott. And he has black, monochrome, chucks. Towards the end of rehearsal we were sitting next to each other and the conversation went like this:

Me: (hiking up his pant leg) hitops...?
Scott: yeah, I was going to get low tops but they didn't have them...
Me: ...of course you were...
Travis: (laughter) (from across the room)

In other news, I re-wrote the ""Chosen"" score, Matt's new song on myspace is amazing, and I have a new philosophy on religion if you care to hear it. And I miss you. A lot. And I keep coming into situations in places we've shared and my memory just replays the events which happened there. From what I can tell, Georgia is good so far and I hope you're happy for the most part. You missed a KILLER episode of Stella last night though. I'll try to make Casey steal/pirate DVD's for you to catch up on. It's late and I need to get up early tommorrow so this is the end...for now. Perhaps I should say:

To Be Continued...
(like Back to the Future)

Love,
Kevin Shaw

p.s. I went to Cabellas. It was lame. Josh Stubeng works at the candy store. Creepy."

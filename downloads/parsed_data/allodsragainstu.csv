It was Serena, and being the pathetic fuck she is, she was stoned, and living at daddy's. So, i'm just talking to her.. really could care less. So as the conversation continues she tells me she'd had a miscarriage some time ago. So, I tell her that you know, i'm sorry for her loss no matter how much she should never reproduce. And then she tells me it was her bf's baby. And i'm thinking.. She knows who she's slept with? That's a joke.... So I was right she eventually told me she didn't know who the father was. Still a fucking whore..Some things never change.. jesus. Stupid bitch. I pity any man that ever lays a finger on her. She's so dirty by now, for fucks sake, get your life in order. Loser. Sleeping around, being anorexic and bulimic while pregnant, smoking pot, living with daddy, and in college, get it together you stupid bitch... god I hate her."

Babysat my cousin today, I sware he's the son of satan.It was alright, we sat around and played some nintendo 64. 
Came home, watched some tv. Talked to Nicole a bit. Watched more tv. Had a GREAT breakthrough on a story i'm working on. Was very happy about that, very fucking happy. I was so pissed when I backed the story into a corner. But it's okay now.
I'll update later...."

"event","Well, it's midnight here in Illinois. My mom just went to bed. My cat, named Dog is curled up in my lap. And my other cat, female, Siamese named cat, is in the window. Wing blowing softly from the east through the window pushing the curtains over the garbage can. Partly cloudy and warm. My cell phone is charged with no calls, everyone else is asleep. I have my Orange juice and my cd playing. I'm quite content.
      Al-tho completely bored and lonely, still content. Tomorrow i'm going job hunting since i'll be here for a while. I'll be here for a while cause of Nicole. She's in Michigan, only like 7 hours off. The way she talks we'll be seeing each other often. She's coming out for a week in a month, then we're going to hippie fest together. Can't wait. We had really bad meeting. She showed up we were off to michigan. Not even 15 minutes later, she slams on her brakes almost hitting a van. Someone called her in for reckless driving. GREAT. Well, were off 20 minutes later after getting pulled over. We head out from the caseys after talking it out. We get about an hour off again and she pulls over for gas and her roommate calls telling her that I can't stay there or she'll have to get the RA involved. WHAT A BITCH. I hate her already.  So we spend the weekend here, it was nice, i loved it. Only bad part was the short time and I broke the ticker on my cell phone. But she's home now safely. It's been a day or two since we were together. 
      Well, i'll update tomorrow, take care. Later."

"event","Hola everyone.. Who ever you may be. It's been quite some time eh? Haven't really done anything special. Still singing, still working. 
     One thing people might like to know, is that i'm having a baby. How? Well, I met this girl named Abbey. We hit it off good. So, I ended up moving to NY, plattsburgh. We ended up getting engaged and almost got married easter sunday. Buuuuuuut if anyone has ever followed my love life, things do not work out.. ever. So, she ended up lieing about everything, has had a still born baby, has had an abortion and has a 2 year old daughter, by some guy who raped her. And now he has custody.. hmm. Fishy? I THINK SO!  So i'm hanging out at my moms for a while. And this is the update. She's having the baby and is going to marry the man who raped and beat her. GREAT. So i'm screwed how are you?
     SO, recently i'm getting back on my feet. Getting ready for Summer camp ( HIPPIE FEST ) Yet again> Really exited about that. 
     Obviously jenny and I have broken up. Don't know if I ever put her in here. But it was a decent relationship. But oh well.
     Right now i'm seeing a gal named Nicole, she lives in MI. College student. She's great. I think this will be a great relationship. But we'll see... Most of it depends on what happens between me and Abbey. I want nicole.
     Right now i'm looking for a normal job to do when i'm not working the music gig. Don't know how that's gonna work right now, lost my wallet. Drivers license. Social security card, voters card and my BLOCKBUSTER CARD!! nooo! But that's all going to be replaced I guess. 
     So, look for more updates they'll be here. Take care, later."

"event","While I was out. I worked the show at Three sisters park. It was insane. The music wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The work was a bitch but well worth it. I loved it. All my life I've looked for a four leaf clover. And the first hippie chick I slept with gave me one. I thought that was awesome. We'd wake up. get dressed work about 10 to 15 hours give or take. Shower and eat, get drunk and do what not. I don't smoke so yeah. Then wake up and do it all over again. For about a week. The only bad part was that Sunday we had some tornados in the park. While trying to evacuate the hippies I got hit by a cooler and a car. Kinda sucked a lot. Funny thing was Out of all the crew, I had the least injuries. After that on the way home my fucking car broke down. God that pissed me off. Took all the money I made to fix it. Oh well. And not even a week after I'd been home. Jenny (the girl I met at Vandy and stayed with in Tennessee) called me. She's home in Maryland for the summer. She wanted to be with me again and have a deeper relationship or something so she asked me to come over and meet her Mom and Step father. Her and her mother are 100% born in China and her stepdad is Irish.... So him and I got along fine. Her moms cool as shit. So Jenny and I have sorta been together for about 3 months. But it's official. She lured me in. That's cool. I like her. Umm. Just got back last night actually. A lil tired but whatever.  She's coming over in August after she gets settled back in school. I'm sun burnt as hell too. We camped out at Assateauge national park (it's right on the beach) for two days. We saw ""The day after tomorrow"" Didn't like it. And ""Garfield"" Loved it. So, I'm home.. same ol' same ol'. Well, as a matter of fact.. Jennys waiting for me to call.. I'm like 20 minutes late.. and I have a  party to go to in 2 hours... So, later."

"event","Hello. Well, Nothing much really going on. Umm. I'm like 600 bucks in debt though? Yeah... Fuck. My Mom woke me up like 3 days ago? Maybe 2, she asked for my car title. I was like ""No."" She wouldn't except that. She's relentless out of no where. So I ask why. Well, while I was in Tennessee her BF (Stan) broke the washing machine. So she wanted to go get a loan. I asked her to use her car title but she gave me some lame excuse. So she promised if I got the loan and everything that she'd pay it off. So it's a local bank. They know the people. I say we'll go talk with them. We get there and the like main guy that runs the joint is on vacation. He always deals with my family I guess. They're all good friends. whatever. So we get some ugly old lady and she's nice. When It all comes down to it we get the loan. 1,000 dollars. The deal is that it will be paid off by may 1st of 2005. My Mom said she'd just use her income tax. So okay. Her and I go to lowe's and look around. We pick something out. Comes out to around 400 some odd dollars for a washer and drier. Yeah. she had to have a drier too. Dammit. Well, we have the rest of the money left. So I tell her we're going to sears. I bought me a tent a new sleeping bag a small cooler and a lamp for the 4 day concert I'm working at 3 sisters park at the end of the month. I fill up my car and she keeps the rest. Well, she was supposed to take the receipt from lowe's to the bank so they could do shit with it. I don't know... I was half a sleep. not paying attention. Threw the shades on and passed out basically. Well, Mom comes home all pissed off. she tells me that they want the money we didn't spend back. Didn't know they could do that. So it's all on my head. I go from like Triple A credit to nothing. She doesn't have 600 some odd dollars. Nor do I. This concert is only like a 3 to 400 dollar pay off. So fuck. Well, she says she's gonna go in on Monday and talk to MR. Co-walt (the friend of the family guy on vacation) So hopefully they can figure it out. I think it's ridiculous to give it back. I singed for 1,000 dollars. Didn't say anything about giving back the UN-spent. What do you think?
     Well, anyway. Things with me an Naomi are all right. We talked the other night about 20 minutes. Then the next day ... nothing. Last night I was weight lifting and asked to call her back but she said no... So I got to talk to her less than a minute. I don't know. I'm trying so hard here. And this kid with the foreign car name. Corvell or something. He was just with her before her and I got together. I mean I think she still wants to be with him. She works with him. Nothing I can do there. I have to accept it. But she's been online a few times since we got together. I've talked to her two times online since we've gotten back and she's still yet to take his name outa her profile. see. I just checked 2 seconds ago:

         kisses for Cordell     

So, I don't know. It's rather unnerving but I trust her so. I hope it all works out for the best. Well, it's Saturday night. I'm having some friends over So I've gotta run and get some foor/drinks and movies. Take care. Later."

Great parties too. Hmm. Nothing new really. Looking for a steady job. I have a concert to work the end of the month. Memorial Day weekend. It's gonna be pretty cool. I think it's called ""The Hippie Fest."" Anyway. I get to stay in a tent for four days and play with the P.A. Systems. I get to work security as well. Normal. just don't like the shirts they make us wear. And they're giving me like a 45 minute slot to fill so I'm working on that. Haven't done any performing in a long time so Gotta get back ""in shape"" hahaha. It's more than a 300 dollar pay off. So looking forward to that. So, catch this, Naomi calls me last night. Haven't heard from her in a while. I was kinda in a bad mood to begin with. Her reception was awful too. could barley hear her. So I was getting fed up and about to just let her go and we started talking. Well, Against all my beliefs at first. We're back together. She's coming up probably the begging of next month. (trying to get her to not bring her taco bell dog..thing). But yeah. I didn't believe it at first. Thought she was toying with me again. But it's real. I'm very happy. Haven't felt this good while I'm not having sex in a long time. Hahaha. I'm not gonna let myself, nor her fuck it up this time. But regardless... Things couldn't be better now. Got rid of all the phsyco bitches I can't stand of. Hopefully for good. Took awhile though. Umm. Got a few jobs. Just looking for a steady one. Good car. My girl back. What more could a guy want? Rather than to be rich. But perhaps that comes later? I also ... regretfully so sold all my games and systems. Figured I needed to let it go eh? Well, I'm more focused on my life now. And where I wanna be. So it's all for the best. Maybe when I get married and have kids I'll buy them all back and hide in the attic ahahah.Well, anyway. I'm off to ... well do nothing really. Haha. Guess I'll just go write. Later."

"event","Well, I get to the party about an hour after my entry yesterday. Said my hellos and what have you and there she is. Stacey. I about ran out until Phil seen me. It went okay at first. You see Stacey is a nut case. She has a lot of problems and she thinks me feeling bad for her and taking her out to dinner so she can blow some steam instead of killing herself, (which at the time was the rumor) Means I love her or something. Well, anyway. We were sitting around the fire and about 2 hours after me being there she comes over to me and starts talking to me. At first I try to block most of it out. So I get up and leave. I get home God knows when. Soon after Naomi called. Eh, were talking again. I'm glad but doubt it to lead towards anything. Well, I got bored. figured by then Stacey would be wasted. So I went and got something to eat and went back to the party. Much to my surprise she wasn't.. Out of character for her. Lets just skip forward and say that I woke up in her bed after a lot of beers. After a bit of not knowing what's going on and freaking out I bailed.  So I got home about 4am... Fun. At about 4:45 Work, (well the factory) calls me and asks me to come in for a few hours. So of course I went in. Just got home about 2 hours ago.... So tired ... so... Yuck.. I slept with her again...Well.. I'm gonna go eat something. No one will call me tomorrow for work (they're all closed) So I'm gonna chill here for some time and relax and get it offa my mind.

1) She can move in with me and my family for a year and go to Spoon River. Then we can move to Calif. I want that one!

2) We move to aurora and get our own place and her get a million student loans.

3) She moves in with her mother for a year and I stay here. Then after her first year in aurora we move to either Florida. Or California. She can go to either.

4) She woke me up this morning with this one. We can move into the same apartment building as her mother and she does community college there for a year. And decides which state to move to.
   I like number 1 the best. It's easier. Simpler. And we only have about 1000 bucks saved between us. So we could save more cash. It makes sense to me. But I don't know. Anyway, I finally got rid of Naomi and Serena perminatly. Thank you God! 

    I haven't updated because when things go good for me and I do update. They go bad. But I figure what the hell. It's all finally in my hands and im not going to let it fuck up."

im going down
flames strung high
my weapon with me close ... my heart
love is my weapon
i wield it strong and forcefully
like every breath it flows threw my body
like lightning so strong and loud
as is my love

all the way down here in the belly of the monster
i can still feel my love radiate for you my darling
like a strong hit to the stomach knocking the wind out of you
my love is that strong but yet worse
unimaginable

not caught when i fell
missing you when im gone

again
im going down in flames
ive fallen into this once more
im down in flames
you didn't catch me
you let me fall
but realized what you let fall
and held strong
the only thing holding me up
is love

its real
like the rain hitting the ground
it leaves its mark
but dries soon
but love of mine
it wont dry
unlike rain
im an ocean
full of love
and you are my world
like a painting
you are my canvas

ive fallen down in flames
but colder its getting 
increasing this feeling
you caught me when i fell
you didn't need me when i wasn't near
but now you cant live without me
its like i somehow put a spell on you

now
your going down in flames
wasn't caught when you fell
so now
were down in flames together
its not game over though
as long as were together

we can catch each other when we fall
rough at first as is
down in the belly of this monster
life
we've fallen into this again
again

all the way down here we've fallen
theirs no where to go but up
and together we go
like the leaf fly's in the wind
we go
together
as it should be
in the carriage of love...


love.."

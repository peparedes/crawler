"event","Okay so i didnt delete my live journal...i just never touch it...until now

I drift away to a place 
Another kind of life 
Take away the pain 
I create my paradise 
Everything I've held has hit the wall 
What used to be yours, isn't yours at all 

Falling apart and all that I'm asking 
Is it a crime, am I over reacting?

He's under my skin 
Just give me something to get rid of him 
I got a reason now to bury this alive 
Another little white lie 

So, what you had didn't fit among the pretty things 
Never fear, never fear, I now know where you've been 
Braids have been untied as ribbons fall away 
Leave the consequence, my tears you'll taste 

Falling apart and all that I question 
Is this a dream or is this my lesson? 

He's under my skin 
Just give me something to get rid of him 
I've got a reason now to bury this alive 
Another little white lie 

I don't believe I'll be alright 
I don't believe I'll be ok 
I don't believe how you've thrown me away 

I do believe you didn't try 
I do blame you for every lie 
When I look in your eyes I don't see mine 

He's under my skin 
Just give me something to get rid of him 
I've got a reason now to bury this alive 
Another little white lie 

My permission to sin 
You might have started my reckoning 
I've got a reason now to bury him alive 
Another little white lie"

You haven't been sucked in by LiveJournal... yet.

Maybe you haven't had an account for long - or maybe you haven't spent enough time exploring LJ.

Don't worry - a few ego strokes thrown your way, and you'll be hooked. Patience. </font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/areyouaddictedtolivejournalquiz/"">Are You Addicted to LiveJournal?</a></div>"

"event","She can feel the pain
and also the sorrow.
She doesn't want to go on.
So she prays for a better tomorrow.

It's hard for her to cope.
She'd like to runaway.
In her heart she knows
that she can't stay.

You can see the sadness
deep within her eyes.
She would like to stop the madness,
but instead, she just cries.

She prays for strength to move ahead.
To survive another day.
She pleads for the courage to be brave
so she can simply walk away."

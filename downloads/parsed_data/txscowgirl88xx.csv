"event","&nbsp;wait I have a livejournal? what?&nbsp;

I used to write in this thing every day, sometimes twice a day. And I mean straight up pour out my soul kind of writing, and I would somehow find some deep revelation about myself while i was writing. ya know???!!!! Now I sit here, last update over a year ago, a lot going on, but not sure how to write in this format anymore haha.

I am in Schaumburg again, first time in a loonngg time. I love Texas and am pretty ready to just get back there. Schaumburg doesn't have too much to offer. I think I am actually going to go back to the high school tomorrow. Wierd, right? I just want to see the choir. and then peace out. Oh and Atchison of course because I love her. Possibly Pennisi just to brag about my new teaching position.

Oh yes, I am a teacher now. I teach the astronomy labs at good ole UNT. I run the big dome planetarium, teach student proper use of telescopes and computer based telescopes, as well as point out some pretty kick ass things to look at in the sky, and telescope simulators through the computer lab. loves it.

Stephanie Stephens is still the love of my life. 

I might be going to Ireland for spring semester 2009. Possibly with Lindsay Bukiet!!!! Which is actualy a complete coinicidence that we picked the same university at the same time. fingers crossed.

Still doing choir at the university, but no longer a music major. Literature major, very happy with it. Can't you tell English is my major by my abundant use of sentence fragments?

Juno is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Besides Across the Universe.

but Buffy the Vampire Slayer remains the best TV show ever.&nbsp;

My sister is having her last surgery hopefully ever next weekend. Just getting scar tissue removed from her other cancer surgeries. So thats gooooooood. My niece is now 5 inches taller than me and wears size 11 shoe. WTF?!&nbsp;

I have still been working at Sunrise Assisted Living and its been pretty good for me. A very rewarding job I suppose. today was my last day though so it will be nice to relax this last week I am home.

I have an apartment and an adorable kitten. I dont think I'm going to keep living there next year though. Maybe a house? maybe?

I feel like doing something crazy. Like a spontaneous road trip, like breaking into that place that makes swimming pools and getting attacked by guard dogs. Oh wait that wasnt fun at all...

haha but something along those lines.

I also have a craving to obtain new music. New good music that is super indie and super underground. you know the type. And to get new tattoos and piercings. And all of these cravings are incredibly strong. Maybe later this week. I am a very spontaneous tattoo-getter. Hopefully this doesnt end in regret.

Well, this has been the end of my yearly update. Please notice that there is no mention of a love life. Just a note to myself when&nbsp;I look back on this later haha. I hope it was random enough for anyone who still reads this thing. I know I feel no better nor worse for writing it.&nbsp;

ummm peace out? :)"

"event","<p>I don't actually know who still reads these, but I just wanted to get a few thoughts out and let whoever is still living in the livejournal community know that I am alive and well in Texas.</p>
<p>It is really strange being so far away from the people that I really care about. But I guess that's what I wanted right? I wanted to come here and make myself feel complete without having other people complete me. I am perfectly aware how dramatic that sounds, but regardless, it is true. And I think I am acheiving what I wanted. I'm having a lot of fun down here, and Texans are all so nice. It's almost like a completely different culture. People seriously care about each other. I never realized what a difference that would make in a community or in people's lives.<br /><br />So, I ran away from&nbsp;Ilinois and I don't intend on visiting often. How can a place be such a hell hole yet at the same time be my home? And why am I asking that question when I already know the answer. The people I love are in Illinois. Wherever they happened to be, that would be home.<br /><br />I also wanted to comment that it's funny how sometimes God cannot be more obvious about where he wants you to go. One can try every road, every path, and every possible means to try&nbsp;and get their own agenda completed. But he will close door after door and burn every bridge, until the only way left for you to go is crawling through a window. There is no such thing as a coincidence.<br /><br />Although these thoughts of mine are jumbled, confusing, and probably contradicatory, I want it to be said that I am enjoying myself immensely here. My classes are easy and boring right now, but I'm hoping that will change as the semester continues. I joined choir, and that is keeping&nbsp;me really busy, but I aboslutely love it. I applied for an internship with the Student Government Association here at UNT and I find out today if I got it or not. I am also thinking about&nbsp; joining a literature club. I am trying to build up the courage to join a church here on campus. I love my roomates, and I love the weather. So really, I cannot complain about anything.<br /><br />I have decided that this December I'm donating my hair to Locks of Love. I want to go help in New Orleans for Spring Break. I want to graduate in 3 years and then go on to graduate school. I want to spend a year as a missionary, and I want to adopt 2 children.<br /><br />Where those thoughts came from, I have no idea.<br /><br />I hope everyone is well and i miss ya'll! (I'm sorry, I had to say it! I'm a Texan now).&nbsp;&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","this morning, the alternative of shooting myself opposed to attending school was looking pretty bright.

School is getting to be such a drag. I need graduation and summer and Greece and college and a new town and a new life. ASAP. not because this one is really bad or anything, just because it's getting old. 

Britny's birthday is on Friday and that's pretty cool, and Kevin's birthday is Saturday so i'm going to U of I to celebrate. Excitement:)

I'm in prom fashion show. My dress is really ugly. oh well, don't care.

I made v-show for the first time in 4 years. That's pretty cool too.

I havent really been to many Charlie Brown rehearsals. This makes me feel bad because I feel as if I'm not realy part of the show yet, which makes me sad. And it's definitly not that I'm choosing not to go, it's more along the lines of what alyssa said earlier: Looking at my weekly schedule, i really don't even have time to pee, much less go to rehearsals.

Stephanie, Caitlin, Rob and I had fun painting stephanie's house this weekend. 

Did I mention i was excited to go to U of I?

and in other news, i hate IHSA. lol jk, but really, the judges were so difficult this year! how disappointing. 

Tomorrow is late start and that is happiness. 

It is really sad at work with Lew gone. But it gets easier every day as it becomes more normal. I wish that his absence would never be looked at as normal, but thats how it happens. I just need to always remember him and then he will live. Yes that is very cheezy, but it's true.

Wow this was long. THE END"

"event","This weekend was amazing.

And I am going to go out on a limb and say that today was a good day. Not because everything in it was good, but because i have begun to consider any day that enhances life, even if it's sometimes negative, as a good day. 

My job has become very emotionally stressful. I work at an assisted living home, and it is very easy to get attached to the residents. Death is a very common thing in places like my job, yet death never ceases to be sorrowful. I hope that I never say that working at an assisted living home has made me ""used"" to death, because I have honestly seen so much in this year that I've worked there and I'm still not used to it. Although, after knowing some of these amazing people i better understand that death really is part of life. I won't ever forget Marion Edwards holding my hand. I never thought one could look at a person and see death; i never thought that one could actually see life slipping away. 

In lighter news, I went to the bookstore today afterwork, because i just really needed it. I bought a book for Kevin and I bought A Handmaid's Tale because I'm doing it for my AP project. Then, on my way out the door I passed by a table where books were advertised as being $3!!!! I serioulsy ran back to the register and purchased 3 of the best feminine classics a feline can by: Emma, Anna Karenina, and Vanity Fair. I left the bookstore elated, all serious thoughts of life, death, and other nonsense completely forgotten.

I do believe i am the ultimate nerd.

And-tomorrow is late start. I couldn't be happier"

I spent this evening walking around the mall by myself and pondering my shitty day, and I decided that i have had some great moments in life, and i have ""lived in the now,"" and i have all these little bits of memories and accomplishments and peices of life. however, in the end if they don't fit together to make a big picture, i really don't have anything at all. 

So my point is i have some work to do. 

I am going to visit U of I this weekend and it is going to be a fun and lovely loop to add to this rollercoaster i like to call life. Exactly what i need i hope

Today was the Macro field trip to the Federal Reserve. wonderful! I also have field trip every day this week exept for Wednesday. I am going to shoot myself in the face with make up homework. YES! And all the projects that are due. I think this week is honestly gonna kill me.

Ashley Sylvester accompanied me to a choral concert at lovely Concordia

Jon. We went back to my house and were joined by Kevin, Rob, Sam, and

-snow
-cold
-less things to do because one can no longer go outside
-hell to drive in
-can't see anything green and green is beautiful
-the days get super short and I feel even more so as if I've gotten NOTHING done
-hardly any sunshine
-no flip flops/tank tops
-pale, pale skin. dull, dull hair
-my car gets sooo dirty. and why wash it? it's just gonna get dirty again
-more homework
-now i think i'm just making things up so i shall stop

well i'm glad that it's not even December yet and I already hate winter bwahahhaa.

I'm not sure when i will learn that I can only put things off for so long. Here i am, just beginning college applications and my homework at almost midnight. And then I complain about it, but really, i have no right to do so because i choose to have things this way. I choose to jam-pack my schedule, leaving me no free time to do ordinary things like practice, apply to college, spend time with my mom, play with my cat, read, or just think.  And then all i do is complain that i can never get anything done. However, if i really cared so much, then why don't i just make time, or take something out of my schedule that I consider not so important? 

ooohhhh well. Procastination is just the way to go i suppose.

My love for Sara Lee today brought me to tears. hehe. She is so lovely

THANK YOU LINDSAY BUKIET FOR STEALING MY LJ ICON AND PUTTING IT IN THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER. AND NOT EVEN ATTRIBUTING IT TO ME....SERIOUSLY. 

lol jk :) I feel honored.

<br>
Yesterday was quite lovely. I finally learned the Mr. Saxon dance with
Tony, Ashley, and Kelly. Mucho divertido. I'm so excited to perform it
haha.
<br>
<br>
I went to work which was kinda depressing. Snow is hell, especially while driving in it. <br>
<br>
I picked up Britny after work and we ate Applebees with Brian Tyrpin.
Mr. Williams happened to be there and that caused much pointing and
laughing. Next, we went to Susan's with a bunch of coolest people i
know, including Gagan, Keely, Dagmara, Frisky, Brandon, Tony, Ashely,
Lauren, Kevin, and probably others. <br>
<br>
Gagan,Keeley, Brian, Britny and I left to go see Good Night, and Good
Luck. 2 movies in one weekend! crazy style. The movie was wonderful.
Britny and I counted the amount of people that got up and left during
it and it totalled to 11 people. They were obviously communist and
therefore offended by the film.We all, however, enjoyed it very much.
There was a lot in it and it could get hard to follow, but it was sooo
well made. A lot of good cinematography. So I would only recommend
going to see it if you're smart, intrested in history, and an American.
haha jk. <br>
<br>
Oh and the woman in the opening scene stole Gagan's coat.<br>
<br>
We hit up the IHOP after the movie, where I ran into Cirone. That's
always a good time. I had so much fun with those kids. There is nothing
I enjoy more than conversing over warm cups of coffee, and in Britny's
case a plate of lemons. ""Presentation is everything.""<br>
<br>
I slept over and Britny's but left early in the morning because I had a hope. But it was shot down. Again<br>
<br>
Rees and I went to Tony's to learn the rest of the dance. Everyone
better be ready for leap frog, log rolls, lots of leaping, the Cosby
Show Reveal, and Red Rover. <br>
<br>
We also went to Hobby Lobby and bought the most amazing dried naturals ever dried.<br>

"event","Well, this weekend has gotten a lot better! My aunt's birthday party, movie watching, board game playing, and lots of humble good times. 

We went to Dallas today! It's a smaller city but i liked it a lot. I saw where Kennedy was shot. It was so cool to see. I could just picture him coming down that street, it was so weird. that history wasnt even that long ago, if you think about it. My dad remembers it. That is history we can relate to, and i was standing right there!!! haha so awesome. I'm a nerd.

I love jimmyeatworld so much right. and Jewel, as always.

I know that when I come back to Schaumburg it's gonna hit me like a wave. gggrrr.

 I hate having my sister and my neice so far away. It was so good to see Lauren though, cuz now i will worry a lot less. She looked so healthy :) Such a relief. I know she's gonna be fine. I just know.

I miss my friends! I'm excited to see people again.

I am already counting down until Thanksgiving break."

<P><FONT size=1>You don't notice at first. it's just the little things that eventually get to you. You change the way you get ready in the morning. You put your jewlery on differently. Something happens and your first instinct is to make that phone call and share your&nbsp;news But then you remember you can't, because there's no one to call. It's looking at the stars and realizing that you'll never reach them again. It's the song you sing for the one who will never hear it. It's sitting in front of a computer screen and wondering who you're typing for. It's little things like that.</FONT></P>"

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
College selections are still stressful. Being accepted to Concordia
makes things much easier, because now at least i know that i can go to
college even if no where else accepts me. But i still have to write a
bajilllion essays when musical is over.
<br>
<br>
I'm excited for my Texas visit.

<br>
<br>
Homecoming was fun:) It was another ""last"" of senior year. It's already going by so fast!

I feel like i need to take more pictures. <br>
<br>
BTW, kevin found my digital camera!!! and by""found"", i mean that he finally noticed it sitting on the ledge in his house.<br>
<br>
Another one of my friends got into a car accident yesterday, and once
again I was in the car. I'm seriously like a curse. I'm never getting
into the car with another friend again.<br>

I love fall so much.

I got a college acceptance letter today in the mail!! its a pretty good feeling reading one of those.

Last night was the last marching band game ever! I hate marching band so i'm not that emotional...but still, it's the end of an era. I am no longer part of an amazing legacy and that's kind of sad. But the year is no where near being done so now is now the time for sadness.

Tonight is my senior homecoming and I'm gonna make it great. Tony Randall and I are going to dance the night away and have an awesome time.

Bryan Tyrpin is home:) but he didnt call me!! he's gonna die when I see him. haha jk

13)hung out with Jenna

yep i think that's everything

However, this weekend will be even better. Steph and I going to U of I :) I cant wait!

and it's only Monday....

Quote of the weekend...

Jenna: I really don't think I believe in things like natural selection or evolution. Especially about cave men.
Jason: Jen, historians know for a fact that there were cavemen. We have tons of evidence to prove that the early forms of humans were big, thick-boned, unable to communicate with language, and well...stupid. They used hardly any of their brain.
Jenna: I still don't believe it, becuase to me you just described the football team...


I thought I was gonna pee in pants. She served that know-it-all right!


I'm gonna be fired by own mother"

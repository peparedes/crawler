"event","well today was a little better I talked to my mom last night and asked if I were to move back home would I be welcome to her house and she told me no and that I need to stay down here for at lest a year... I was so hurt by that and now I don't even want to go home b/c I think she is a selfish Bitch and she has treted me like shit since I was little and all she cares about now is her other family and husband and i hope someone shows this to her so she knows how much she has hurt me.... But anyways I won't answer any of Matt's calls b/c I don't want him to talk about what he was talking about on the pone the other night and I'm dreading tomorrow b/c I know he is going to be all over me and I'm really close to saying fuck u and braking it off with him b/c of other resons to ... but anyways I have'nt talked to Jesse yet today so after I get of line I'll probably call him and ask If he has answered Melissa about going out with her.......(I'll kill him if he says yes) well G2G T2YS"

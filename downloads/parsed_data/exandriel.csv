"event","I fixed my internet yesterday. Had to restore the whole system then reload the drivers...donno what I did different than the other time, but the computer seems to be okay now. Anyways, I called compaq to get help, but the computer is out of warantee and they wanted me to give them 40$ for tech support...screw that...

But my net is up...happy day. :)

My druid (D&D) is level two now, so for all who care (I do so NEH! >;-P) she is awesome. She has an ability called Woodland Stride. She can now walk through briars and thick bushes without taking damage or slowing down. YAY! ^_^ It's kewlness....more HP too, and an attack bonus, along with more spells! WOO! ^_^

My internet is back on, as I said, so I can start playing one of my favorite online games. It's called merentha, and I have a nifty assassin named similaria. if you want to look at the game, the details are on <a href=""http://www.merentha.com""> The Merentha Website <a/> So yeah....life is nice...it's a MUD, which means you need to learn all of the commands, but after that it's pretty easy and fun. Anyways...have fun!"

"event","Heheh ^^ I got my glasses. I love them, they're really nice. I have two pair, one with gold rims, and ones with with bronze/brass(can't decide which) rims. They're so nifty. When I put them on, the world looked soooo surreal ... it's like....woooowww...

Anyways, I've been having fun. I don't have to go to psych 101 tomorrow, YAY. But I do need to go to a court hearing for extra credit. Also, I'm going to an improv performance tonight. ^_^ I can't wait!!!!!! I know some of the guys there, and they said they may pick me as a volunteer. This is gonna be fun!

Looking back on my attitude over the years, I've become a lot more happier, and confident. This is due to the fact that I'm branching out and figuring out how I tick. I know I'll be happier when I move out too...I won't have to go to that horrid harvest church. I hate it there...just being there gets me aggravated, and that usually gets me on the bad side of my mom. *yawn* I'm killing time right now, Need to wait until 4 pm to head over to martial arts class...oh yes! It's well overdue that I mention this, but I went up another rank a while back! I'm no longer a Gokkyu, I'm a yonkkyu! One more rank and then I'm up to brown belt. Oh so close to black belt!!!

Thanks for reading (if anyone does), and I'll try and post later."

"event","LOL My first D&amp;D campaign yesterday(saturday) was greatness. We all almost died on the first monster. We were crossing a bridge that was starting at 10 ft. wide and ended at 2 ft. wide. We had to make a Dexterity check to see if we could make it across. One of our party fails and falls down taking 11 damage...he's now -1 hp and bleeding. Then...a monkey-like...thing...attacks us. I later found out he's a 4th level critter fighting *counts on fingers* 5 level 1 characters...only 2 or 3 of which are risking going down. So.....eventually we kill it and I have a good rank in the Heal skill (to bind wounds), so I try and climb down the steep ledge and fall...taking 11 damage too...and I'm also at -1 hp. So...this other guy manages to bind our wounds so we don't die and I end up healing everybody up when I wake up. All in all, it was interesting...our whole party nearly killed off by a bridge...and the scary thing is...we're on the side of the bridge where we have to cross it. Oi.... It was fun though, I can't wait for this saturday when we get to continue again. There's not much I have left to talk about...man I'm full, that chinese food I ate is gonna kill me *belches and winces* ohhh....bad belly....don't jiggle....owie... I'm reminded of a Cartman quote ""To...much...coffee...blegghhh"" Anyways...check yas later. PS: Answer: Hide in the corner murmuring something about not believing in dog ^_^ (No offense to my athiest friends)"

"event","Woo...little wars today, after lunch. My friend didn't get home soon enough for us to go sunday, and he has classess all day monday, so we're going to go today. I'm a little nervous about a speech I'm going to give soon, and I hope I do at least C or B okay. I just typed my final version of my outline and made a couple of changes on my notecards....erk...

I need to talk about myself for about 3-5 minutes, which for most people wouldn't be a problem. Normally for me it wouldn't be an overly bad problem, but I have to stay focused. :p In an average conversation where I'm just talking to talk I can go from catholic-ism to wondering how lobster tastes...my mind wanders and strangely enough it hasn't been eaten yet.

I can't believe I'm actually keeping up with my livejournal...and by all means make comments, it makes me think people actually read this drivel XD!

I may have mentioned this before (I don't remember if I did) but the martial arts newsletter I hoped would be put in the monthly newsletter WAS excepted. It felt gooooooooooooood ~:p. EEP! My next class is in 11 minutes...I so don't want to give this speech. I don't enjoy reading verbally what I write that much...I also have a problem saying out of my mouth what I'm thinking in my brain...like I could be thinking ""I like linkin park because their music speaks to me and I find them appealing to the ears."" but I'll say, ""Heh...yeah, linkin park's kewl..."".

It's so sad and pathetic...anyways, I have to go. I wish you all a good day.

Au revoir!"

"event","I just got out of a catholic mass. It's sunday, of course, and I actually enjoyed it. I'm not overly surprise, but it was nice to get away from the ""death and damnation"" of harvest. 

Me and my friend are going to go to a gaming place called Little Wars soon, either today or monday. ^_^ yay! I can't wait, and after I go to little wars, there's a little book-store near hammond that I want to go to. The lady in there is nice, and I got some nice books last time.

Anyways, I'm about to have to go to harvest to meet my mom. We're going to a place called the Yellowbird Cafe, I think I may have mentioned it beforehand in another post. I'm going to have a vegan lunch. :) I'm ordering a natura burger, a burger with a large portabello mushroom instead of a beef patty. MMmmmm-mmm, and it comes with waffle fries too ^_^.

I'm also thinking of submitting my picture on hotornot.com, and maybe I can meet someone. Heh, I donno, but it's worth a shot. Anyways, I'll try to write again soon...sees you when I sees you."

"event","Sorry I haven't written in a while, but my computer at home has gone haywire. It refuses to listen to reason and around 2 and a half hours on the phone with a technician...but......*deep breath and slow exhale* I can't do anything about it. The BellSouth maintenance people have said that I must call the computer's manuafacturer (I have a 5-6 year old Compaq) and get them to put a new IP address into the computer.

They give me the number to call compaq and get this...my mom throws it away the next day. It's a beautiful world I suppose...but sometimes the people in it can kind of suck. 

Oh, I have a D&D group now, and that makes me quite happy. :) I have an Elven Druid, and I have a 6 intelligence :p (Really really smart monsters/animals can have up to a 5). I have a 16 intelligence though, and the DM says it evens it out. I can't wait for the campaign to start, though...it starts not this weekend but the next weekend and then we all get together and have fun. I look forward to the way     Tim (<-----Dreamy Guy) DMs the game. I wish he was interested in me though, he's really nice and cute...I got him a bear for valentines day (he collects them) and he liked it. Granted I had to give it to him today  (a day late) since I couldn't find him yesterday (valentines day). He still liked it though. ""My friend Jean says that you can tell a good teddy bear by his eyes"" --Tim Heheheh, he said the teddy bear I gave him had pretty eyes, that made my day.

Even though I know we can never be together, I still wish him a happy life, and I love being around him. He's a very special friend. Anyways...please excuse me for ram--Oh Wait!!

My other character--for a similar game to D&D called Rifts--is awesome! He's a Dog-Boy (half dog, half human) mystic (magic-user). He is a master at psionics (telekenetic/pathic) and has magic spell abilities too! Also he has a speed of 46, which means he can run 920 feet per second, YAY. He's awesome, he can read (which is actually not as common as you think in this game), he's an Escape Artist, he's streetsmart, he can conceale himself. He's so awesome, he also has an energy rifle proficiency. Aside from the psionics and magical-stuff I'm going to try and make him out to be a sort of sniper too. I LOVE versatile characters!

ANYWAYS, I'm really done this time. I'll try and write soon. Love yas."

"event","Well, my first week of college is over. I like my classes, but I'm not sure sure about one...Theatre Appreciation. My martial arts are doing great, I'm going for my next belt. Blah blah blah blah....nothing to talk about...oh yeah. Salvia Divinorum, used as a meditational enhancement (the way I will use it) or a legal trip (the way most use it). It's interesting...I'm trying it tonight, I'll post what it was like on the LJ. Anyways...job search goes on...coping with classes. Nothing else really going on other than fixing my car and spending my loan refund (<---how I bought the Salvia). So...I guess I'll let you go, later."

"event","Well...hello one and all who actually will read this (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Someone reading this? Funny) the first thing I suppose I'll explain is the username I used, ""Exandriel."" The church I go to used to play the song, ""Emanuel"" a lot...my warped and twisted mind ( don't ask why it's warped and twisted....it just IS) changed the word up to Exandriel...pronounced the same way mostly (Ex-ann-dry-ell). The second thing I suppose I'll explain is the picture...it's from Vampire Hunter D, a pretty damn good anime if I do say so myself (and I do). The guy in the pic is a half-vampire, I had started writing a story once with a main character ""Exandriel"" who was a vampire...it seemed appropriate, the choice of picture.

Anyway...about me....hrrrrrm.....I'm 18, live in louisiana. I take martial arts, and am a 2nd degree white belt in the Shindoryu Aikijutsu Association. I love it there, surrounded by friends and the sweat and blood. Anyways...I'm forced to go to a church named Harvest and I'm a partly closeted homosexual. (Yay for me! :p) (More closeted towards my parents and people attend said church). I live with my mom (another reason I hide it from my mom) and hope to (VERY SOON) move out one day. Right now I'm searching for a job and hope to find one VERY VERY VERY SOON.

Anyways....you read down to here....you are very patient ...or equally bored. I'll try and post more, see yas."

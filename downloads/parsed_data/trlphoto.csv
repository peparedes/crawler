"event","The new Mix is right on its way, this season ive got 2 for you.(winter+spring)

The entire package will be titled ""Vent""
One CD is a mixture of old school classic trance that should be pretty fun for anyone whos a fan of electronic music.

The other CD is an amazing mix of Epic and Melody trance that will be sure to please. (Think along the lines of a mixture of techniques between Acosta and Tiesto and you're on the right track)

Anyone is entitled to a copy, just ask me.
Also its illegal to charge for the music... i do, however ask for a 5$ donation to my cause ;) (you dont have to donate, but it'd be nice.)"

anyone who knows me pretty much knows im obscessed with little blue robots that hail by the name of megaman. well the most exciting part of this <b>months</b> post(lol) is that capcom totally got smart and released a Megaman X RPG. yeah... megaman... in an rpg. Turn based combat. ITs totally badass. i cant put the controller down... and of course the female yells at me for it all the time.. but hey, how often does a little blue robot named X dance around your tv in beautiful 3d rendered glory while listening to some badass techno beats! (wait.... hrmmmmm thats bad doesnt it?) oh. btw. Zero is back... as is his black costume for anyone who cares... zero is my favorite video game hero of all time, behind samas aran of course.

And ill defend it as long as i can be left here to linger in silence if i choose to.

"event","nikos wedding man... it was so cute
the wedding was a standard wedding ceremony... no need to get into that

The 1st song niko and christine zervos danced to was amazed by lonestar. 
*sniffle*

christine sang the song to niko as they danced... i wanted to cry. it was fantastic.
niko was so red the whole day... it was awesome

met up with a bunch of old friends... i miss everyone. i even saw crystal... she turned out hot as hell. i am now upset that i didnt ask her out when i had the chance, lol.

niko and i had the chance to talk for a little bit one on one. we both cried. ive never had a moment like that before. im proud of him. i gave him a hug and a pat on the back and with that i was off...

and yes ladies and gentlemen... i got hammered. i know i dont drink and all... but this was a specail occasion. :)
after the reception i drove my drunk ass home and sobered up... then went out again!

Kel ditched me so i decided to go out and meet up with my friend heather (IN FUCKING SPRING HILL) and we ended up going to this pool hall thats pretty much <b>right</b> across the street from cassies house. it was kinda amusing. heather is a rad girl. too bad im interested in someone else.

Finially. because angela would have killed me if i didnt...

"event","IT goes without saying that this country is in a fuckload of trouble. unless your blind and def (or just plain fucking stupid) you'd see shit happening around you that most of you wouldnt stand for any day of the week.

bush needs to go. its plain and simple.

my personal reasons for this... (there are tons more but these are just mine):

1.) Pointless war with iraq. This costs us billions of dollars each month. iraq has nothing to do with terrorism OR weapons of mass destruction.. which is the reason we went to war with them in the 1st place. NOT to mention the lives of all our friends and family fighting over there.

2.) in his 4 years in office bush has turned the biggest federal budget surplus in HISTORY (THIS MEANS SINCE THE US WAS FORMED) into the biggest budget deficit in HISTORY(MEANING WEVE NEVER EVER BEEN MORE IN THE DEBT) Are you gonna stand for that?

3.) A LARGE number of college graduates now cant find themselves decent jobs after graduation. WHY?! because of George W.

4.) $1.80/gallon for gasoline. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING?!!?!?!? I remember 4 years ago bitching when it hit $1.20. It now costs me almost 5 dollars to goto work and back each day. Thats fucking rediculous. 

Ok so im BEGGING all of you... read up on it.. and PLEASE...

VOTE FOR KERRY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD... THE REASON I DONT SAY VOTE FOR ANYONE BUT BUSH IS BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO LOSE... BY A LANDSLIDE. AND BY VOTING THE DEMOCRAT WE CAN DO THAT EASILY.

please visit this website for more information. Is pretty interesting.

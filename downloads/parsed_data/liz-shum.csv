It's the once anticipated now dreaded Mt Sanbe Welcome Party.  It's meant to be a chance for everyone across Shimane to meet each other.  After the whole cliquishness of Hiroshima I'm skeptical about how fun another schoolish weekend can be.  Hopefully I'm just being overly negtive.  Ugh, somehow I'm not managing to convince myself of that."

"event","Here is the pros & cons breakdown of my weekend:

pros:

1. The Ben Folds show was much better than I had expected and good fun.
2. Believe it or not I spent very little money-I only bought necessities.  In my book that includes fritos & a taco kit but whatever.
3. I met some of the newbies and a couple of them seem nice enough.
4. I expanded my horizons by going to a salsa club and dancing poorly.

cons:

1. Getting food poisoning on Sat night and going back to the hotel before 12 to puke & sleep.
2. Will, the loud-mouthed Irishman criticising virtually everything about me.  Apparently, I don't know how to have any fun and am boring.  Why?  Because I am not a raging alcoholic and don't do crazy shit.  Since when is dancing on the bar and other such things the only way to have a good time?
3. I've realised that most of the people living in Matsue are so self-involved it's scary.  They are cliquish and immature.  It's like first year of uni all over again.  To them there are only 3 things that matter: a) themselves, b) sex and c) getting drunk. 
4. Having a very bumpy ferry ride back and not having taken seasickness meds.  Thankfully I kept my food down that day."

"event","This might spoil a bit of the letters I wrote to Heather, Krystin & Andie today.

I've decided my plan of action for when I go home.  Here it is in order of preference.

1. Write the foreign service test, pass, nail the interview & get the job.  I can work a crap job until it starts sometime in the summer of 2007 while squeezing in a trip to Scandinavia.  Then travel the world being my fabulous self all while having the 1 and only Fred as my co-worker.

2. Work in the corporate world, selling my soul to pay for my Prada clothes which by the way, I'm cool with.  My employer will be 1 of the following: a) a multi-national corporation, b) an advertising or PR firm or, c) a fashion magazine.

3. Work whatever job I can get once I'm home to save for teacher's college in 2007-2008 (assuming I can get in).  Spend the year taking French courses p/t so that I can teach FSL and therefore be more employable, if I can afford it.  I'll also have to force my friend Adrienne to let me volunteer to help her in her classes to get experience and tutor some ESL students for the experience too.  All this business and schooling will mean that I have to spend my savings on education and not a trip to Europe.  Wah!

On a more positive note, if I do option #3 I will force Andie to apply to the same colleges as me and be my study buddy.  I'll have to live at home but since I'll be in school my mom can't charge me rent.  Yay to avoiding growing up-sort of anyways."

"event","In a desperate attempt to leave Japan for the winter holidays I called the travel agent & gave her my budget: 2 people traveling on $1500 ea.  Where do we want to go, she asked.  My answer: anywhere that $1500 will cover airfare, hotel, food, etc.  And of course, this is during peak season.  I think she was trying really hard not to laugh.  I've got my fingers crossed that she'll fax me some sweet holiday options but then again, I am the world's biggest dreamer.  Strange that I'm also the world's most bitter cynic. 

On a more optomistic note: I'm going to Hiroshima in 2 days!  I can't wait!  I just hope that the 2 attention starved drama queens that are also going alone don't kill my buzz.  Grr to nut cases!

1. No one bothered to include me in the lunch order AGAIN.  This always happens.  Am I invisible you morons?!  Now I get to starve.

2. The regular birthday airfare prices don't apply to people whose b-day falls between Jan 1-12.  I have to fly between January 6-20 - when I don't have any new years vacation and have to use lots of paid leave. I can't do  that since my sis wants to come here for a week in March.  And really, what would be the point in taking precious time off and spending hundreds of $ to have all of 3 crappy days of warmth.  That's just stupid.

3. Instead of going to Okinawa as planned, I will most likely be spending xmas, new years and my birthday in a cold, remote place where only couples get to celebrate.  All while my friends are off to tropical destinations.  I can't even buy a fruitcake to cry into.

Sadly, I've come back to discover that god is working against me.  Actually, I always knew that, now it's just been confirmed.  Hotmail & MSN have been blocked off the work compu so I'm not impressed.  And apparently the newbies that got here last month are Barbies.

On the upside, I have time to rest up before I have 2 long weekends straight.  During one of those I'll be heading to Hiroshima to catch the Ben Folds show w/Eri & Cat.  Now if only, Jason Mraz would come hear I'd be set.

I'll stop my ranting now.  I'm so glad I got to see you guys.  I just wish I had more time.  It feels like I didn't get to spend enough time with you.  Still, you take what you can get.  Thanks for the surprise party Andie!"

I looked up the times online and here's what I think works best.  We leave on the 9:30 am bus and arrive in TO at 2:30pm.  We take a 9:30am bus back home on the 26th and arrive at 2:30.  I have to be back early enough on the 26th so I can spend time w/my friend who's getting married the next day.

If we buy the tix 14 days in advance it's about $68.  7 days advance it's $76.  So far I know Andie is okay w/those days, who else is in?  If someone wants to go ahead and buy tix now to get the 14 day price, can you get mine too?  I'd pay you back as soon as I see you.  I don't mind paying an extra $8 so you don't have to stress and rush into a decision.  Then the next step is hotel but that shouldn't be too much of a prob.  Feel free to do research in the meantime.

I'm leaving first thing in the morning tomorrow to get to the airport so I can't check livejournal.  I can check my email though so if you write me before 2:55 am the 11th I can respond.  I'll be responding from my cell account (captain-liz@ezweb.ne.jp) so make sure your junk mail won't delete the message.  WELL, I'm out of time.  Take care & talk to you soon!"

"event","I truly think I'll either die or be emprisonned before I can make it home.  This has been a horribly stressful week for me.  It all started off somewhat okay.  I had dinner w/some friends in Matsue before I took an overnight bus to Tokyo.  Everything was pretty good once I got there.  Then I had to go to the airport to pick my bro up.  That's when things went downhill-FAST.

He did 0 research into what he wants to see & do.  I had to plan everything.  All he's been doing is bitching.  Japan is so expensive, it's so hot, it's dirty, blah blah blah.  If everything is sooo expensive that you won't spend more than $5 on a meal then maybe you shouldn't drop $500 @ the Diesel store on a hoodie & pair of pants.

Then he made me climb Mt Fuji.  I think I bloody well deserve a sister of the year (if not century) for that one.  The whole way down he complained about the crappy path and this and that.  He was the reason we did the whole thing so as far as I'm concerned he should have just sucked it up.  But no.

And then he wanted me to help him register for Carleton.  He claims to have read the registration info they sent him but I have my doubts.  He forgot his student # at home, screwed up the date of registration and didn't even start to look into what classes he has to/wants to take.  I did all that crap by myself so why can't he?  I swear, I'm feeling REALLY homicidal.  And of course, I'm being short & bitchy w/him for no reason.  Nothing is his fault I'm just the world's biggest bitch, that's all.

Argh!  I can't wait to be home and away from this stress.  Sorry for unloading it all here but I have to do something while he ""registers"".  Yeah, we'll see how that goes."

The absolute most important one: HAPPY BIRTHDAY KRYSTIN!!!!  I know it's still a few days early but I can't post again.  Have lots of fun & show me the pics when I get home.  

As for the rest, I have all your #s in my old cell phone or so I think.  Assuming it still works then I should be able to call you guys soon after I'm home.  If I don't then my home # is 829-9460.  I might get my cell hooked up w/pay as you go while I'm home so we'll see.

It's looking like I'll be able to afford a trip to TO and therefore Sephora!  So Andie & Krystin, start thinking of good times (weekdays) you can go.  We'll have so much fun, I can't wait!

Don't forget that my party is on the 20th.  I'll send out info closer to then to those of you whose e-mail I have.  If you don't get an e-mail that doesn't mean I don't love you & you're off the hook.  If you know of someone who should come who I don't have contact details for, pls tell them about it.

In the meantime, take care & don't give yourselves liver failure!

ps: I can check my e-mail while I'm traveling in Japan but not necessarily LJ.  So I'm not completely out of touch if you want to contact me."

It should be upbeat, and somewhat danceable but not ghetto Gatineau clubish.  And definitely not overly mainstream pop music.  

I suppose if your name is Alanna you can slip 1 (count 'em 1) Hilary Duff song in.  And in Krystin's case, John Mayer-as long as it's not ""Your body is a wonderland"".

Oh and Donna might be staying w/me for 3 days. Phil doesn't leave til Sat so she has no place to stay.  It annoys me that I'm supposed to put a total stranger up for 3 days.  Yes, I will know her soon enough but I have crap to do.  Like packing & cleaning before I leave on Sat.  Not to mention that I don't cook for myself so I sure as hell am not going to cook for someone I don't even know.  This isn't Liz's B&B.  Maybe I'm being mean but I feel like I'll be stuck babysitting her which is something I REALLY don't want to do.  I can't very well have her in my apt and ignore her.

Sure I'm done most of my packing but cleaning is a bitch.  I'll be out of my house for a month so I'm paranoid about mold & bugs taking up residence while I'm away.

I finally e-mailed Scott today but what with the time difference I can't expect an answer 'til tomorrow at the earliest.  Patience is not a virtue I possess, as you all know.  I insinuated about his make-out session but we'll see if 1) he even responds and 2) if he mentions it in his reply.  

Apparently, any ideas of making plans before I get home have been thwarted.  The lazy-ass priest won't discuss a date for the rehearsal dinner until the 12th.  It looks like it'll be a weeknight so that kills any chances of deciding things in advance since that's most of the free time I have left.  Grr...you'd think ""men of god"" would be more together but then look at some of the other crap they get up to.  

I was thinking of going to TO for shopping mainly.  I want to go to Urban Outfitters, Sephora and Queen St W.  Don't know how I'd get there yet but is anyone interested in going with?  Alanna-if you've never been to Sephora you need to go!  You'll have a heart attack when you see all the make-up.  It'll be your new crack."

After the beach party I went to see Batman Begins on Mon.  ALONE!  I felt like a big loser but I had to watch the movie.  And the fact that I got the day off w/pay for travel reasons didn't hurt.  The next day I left for the English camp.  Fun stuff.  It was nice to be around kids who enjoy learning English.  It was very scary to see 20 something guys mack on teenage girls though.  I wanted kick them in the balls.  So many sketchy guys come to Japan 'cause Japanese girls will date what the girls at home wouldn't touch w/a 10ft pole.

I didn't get back to the island til Fri then I left for a smaller island on Sat.  My friends Jodi & Matthew aren't staying another year so we wen't for a goodbye party.  It's weird to think they'll be home while I continue to live on the island.  Now I'm teaching my last week of classes until Sept.

Now you're pretty much up to date.  I'm going to another party this Sat but they never go as planned so it'll probably be pretty tame and therefore dull.  At least there's less than 3 weeks til I leave the island and about a month til I get home.

YAY!

PS*  I need CD making volunteers for my party.  Only a month to go to the big day so start getting song ideas together!"

Doing so in Japan is pretty damn hard.  So...if anyone can get a hold of anything cool & Canada Day themed PLEASE send it my way.  Temporary tattoos, etc.  I will pay you back when I get home, promise!  It takes 10-14 days to get the stuff so if you could do it asap that would be great.  And I will be eternally grateful!"

logic will break your heart-the stills

And assorted other bitter one-liners.  Please god, let me make it to August!  In the meantime, if you have suggestions for something that's not bitter, morbid or reaking of desperation (as I presently am), let me know."

"event","Well, I finally went to the much (self)hyped Kobe conference.  Turned out to be a bit of a bust.  Despite e-mailing me first (which I took as interest), Neal was no more than friendly.  And he was friendly with lots of girls so that kinda bummed me out.  The bad thing about having a cell w/email is that I end up sending drunken messages to people.  I apologize in advance for any future tormenting I put you through.

And Scott, well that boy confuses the hell out of me.  Other people pick up on the fact that I like him but he doesn't.  Hell, my roommate for the conference asked me if we had hooked up.  I only met the girl there!  Sadly, the answer still remains a big, fat NO.  I really think he's the type of guy you have to beat over the head w/the ""I like you stick"" before he ever gets a clue.  But I don't want to lose a friend so I'm keeping my mouth shut (and putting the stick away) for now.  Why are hetero boys so dumb?

Aside from still being single, waking up sick the 2nd day and having the worst tasting, most over priced so-called Mexican food ever, the conference wasn't bad.  I got off the island so that's always a plus.  And I can always look forward to coming home: 2 months and 5 days to go!

Dan, Ash, Krystin: I've sent you guys all some mail lately so look out for that."

Of course you can bring your bf/crush (crushes if you're Alanna).  Tell anyone who didn't get the e-mail since I'm missing a few people's.  Yeah, I am horribly lame for planning everything 2 months in advance but you know you love me for it!"

"event","This weekend started out great.  I went to visit my friend Alana on one of the other islands.  A bunch of us drank & sang some really bad karaoke.  Then I came home to a letter from Ashley on Sun.  She moved!  I was so shocked, my sappy self cried.  I know I'm the last person who has the right to feel abandoned but still, I will be coming back to Ottawa.  Not some place like say, North Bay!  Wah!

Thankfully, Scott called to cheer me up after I messaged him to say I was having a crummy day.  He's so nice it makes me sick that we're only friends.  At least this means that there are decent guys out there.  In the words of Ben Folds: ""It sucks to grow up."""

"event","So...less than 3 months till I come home.  I intend for it to be 17 days of intense partying.  Anything less and I might not make it through another year.  I was thinking that I might pull a Krystin & have a house party, again.  Was the one I had last summer crap? Be honest 'cause I don't want to be the person known for throwing lame-ass parties.

This endeavour would require much help from you guys.  Since I have been living in the middle of nowhere I could use someone to put together a playlist & the CDs to go w/it.  Otherwise all you'll get is music from last year.  And if I happened to be smoking Oki crack, Japanese pop.  Trust me, you don't want any of that.  Of course I have the right to veto stuff.  For example: No Soul Decision!

And now I will stop making demands and go back to planning my escape from Oki.  Even though it's over 2 months away.  Planning brings hope into an otherwise bleak existence."

"event","I finally got of the island for some much expected fun.  I had been counting the days till the Chugoku Cup soccer tournament.  Of course, I had the crucial role of bystander & NOT player.  It turned into the typical tragi-comedy that is my life.  I wish I could have hung out w/you guys at Krystin's instead.  Although all was not lost...read on:

highlights:
- Scott phone mailing me to tell me he was going afterall (maybe he could be my tent buddy!)
- Making new friends & bonding w/ones I had already
- Meeting cute boys from the prefecture over & having one tell me about a beach party there this summer
- Meeting Neal the uber-hot Vancouverite (is that what you call them?) w/whom I exchanged phone mail addresses so we can, cross my fingers, meet up in Kobe in 2 weeks


lowlights (?):
- Puking my brains out then sleeping it off only to wake up to find most people had passed out
- Discovering that Scott & I would only ever be good friends
- Sharing a tent (out of desperation) w/a guy I only met an hour before, then having him turn all pervy on me
- Waking up, freezing cold, at 5 am and escaping the tent-o-trash to go sleep in Scott's car

I suppose that the pros & cons even out but somehow the ""lowlights"" just depress me so much more than the highlights cheer me up. Wah!"

"event","Well, I finally finished writing 99% of my Hiroshima postcards.  Provided it doesn't pour I will be excusing myself from work for a good hour to walk to the post office and mail them.  I love that going to the post office is a legitimate excuse to get out of work in Japan.  Not that sitting around surfing the net, walking to the vending machine to buy pop and staring out the window aren't better than actually working as well.

I lied, I will rant (slightly).  I just want to say, for the record, that the OC's Marissa is a fucked up bitch.  Yes, I have not seen any episodes this season but still.  Just 'cause your mom has a heart made of stone doesn't give you the excuse to be an alcoholic, shop-lifting, melodramtic cry-baby.  Lots of people have 1 crappy parent, don't grow up rich, aren't super pretty and still manage not to be a train wreck in the making.  And now I will stop.  I think Alanna might kill me if I continue.

Oh and ps: Don't ever order flowers from FTD.  I paid $50 bucks for my mom to get sweet dickall on Mother's Day.  Needless to say I wrote them a not-so-happy e-mail."

"event","Things that I just have to comment on/share, in no particular order:

1. I can't believe you held out on me Banana!  As if you got promoted & didn't tell me?!  Demand a pay raise 'cause your no sucker who works extra for free.  As for all those people giving you a hard time, tell them to shove it up their asses.  Who the hell would say ""Um, thanks for the offer but no, I don't want a promotion ('cause I'm a stupid dumb-ass)""  People (rhymes w/Kay Lee) gave me a hard time too.  Eventually they get over themselves & move on so don't worry too much.

2. Superstar Kelly Gray is MIA (I'm a poet & didn't know it!)

3. House disasters always seem to target me.  First it was bug related now water crap.  God have mercy on my poor self!

4. MAC make-up is a basic human/Canadian right.  I shouldn't have to pay more for it just 'cause I'm in Japan.  Same goes w/Origins & Clinic but esp MAC!

5. I love Eri to bits & would lose my mind without her but I seriously started to question our friendship.  I mean, what sane person gets shopped out after 1 DAY?!  We went to the biggest mall in this part of Japan and she was non-plused.  She couldn't wait to get out of there.  Now THAT's just plain unhealthy!

6. I fully intend to hunt down certain people and exact my revenge on them come August 11.  Beware if your name follows: Fred, Woody, Gardella, Heather and I'm sure I'm leaving some out.  I'll just have to make a thorough list.

7. I noticed that Grant reads live journal...if you're reading this pls add me to your friends (god, I sound desperate).  If anyone knows he won't be reading this, pls pass on my e-mail address.  Thanks!

8. OMG, that was the longest post/rant ever.  I apologize for abusing your eyesight and your friendship.  You can kick me when I get home but pls don't."

Obviously I'm going to see all the sights, museums, etc.  BUT the place does have the biggest mall in this area of the country, ah!  I'm already drooling at the thought of it.  I'm going to try to send out postcards so that would require your addresses.  Yeah, I know you already gave me them but I mean your non-uni ones.  IE: Kate & Steph, pls give me your home addresses. And Banana, if you want a postcard you'll have to give me yours too :p"

"event","I went to the other island on Sat & met up w/a bunch of the lucky buggers who live on the mainland.  We saw some of the the island, had a bonfire on the beach and proceeded to get VERY trashed.  There was much puking that night and the next morning.  I proudly boast that I held my liquor down although I did feel like I'd been runover by a truck the next day.  Playing drinking games is a bit risky.  

So that last statement was an easy observation. Aside from permanent liver damage, people sometimes say things they should keep to themselves.  What for example?  Well, it's kinda creepy to have your new Japanese friend (who is sitting beside you) annouce to a table full of people that he wants to sleep w/you.  Talk about a nervous silence.  Man, when everyone else's answer to that question is ""Orlando Bloom, Angelina Jolie, Heath Ledger""  the next answer shouldn't be ""...You!""  And yes, I'm pretty sure he was serious. Thankfully he doesn't seem to remember the night and I intend to keep it that way.  Isn't there some kind of saying that goes something like ""Don't shit where you sleep"".  This place is so incestuous that I don't need the whole world to know my busy-ness.  Or lack of it to be more honest.

Otherwise the weekend was great.  A few of the girls there got Jack Johnson tickets and one of them thinks she can hook Eri & I up.  We gave her the cash & are keeping our fingers crossed.  I may even start praying...""Please god, let me have tickets.  Forget flaggelation, I live on Oki that's already a huge form of self-punishment!"""

"event","I'm really wishing that I had told my friend I wouldn't be a bridesmaid.  It seems like it's something you'd only wish on your worst enemy not someone you call your ""best friend"".  I have to pay for and wear a dress and shoes that I don't care for and was told I had no say in, flat out.  I'll never be able to wear this dress again since it's a ballgown and has pink sparkles from what I can tell.  To top it off, my friend used the $ I got my mom to give her for the dress to buy jewelry.  WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST!  And it's from Claire's, not to sound like a snot but who wears $5 jewelry at a wedding?!  

I thought my only escape from looking like a carbon copy of the other bridesmaids would be my hair.  Since I'm paying to get it done, I get to choose, right?  Apparently not.  I have been told (in capital letters!) that I have to wear it in an updo w/baby's breath.  The flowers I can deal with but why does it have to be up?  How could my hairstyle ruin her wedding?  It's not like I'd wear a 'fro.  

The worst part? I can't tell her to shove it up her ass since the dress is non-refundable.  I'll be throwing $225 away.  Well, I guess it's thrown out either way since I can't wear the dress again.  I want to scream!  I want to tell her what I think but since the world seems to revolve around her she would just say that I'm selfish.  Am I being selfish?  Is this normal?  I thought that she only got to choose the dress & shoes.  I am so annoyed.  Weddings suck ass!"

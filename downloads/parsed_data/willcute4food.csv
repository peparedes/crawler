I'm planning to canon review extensively <font size=1>why did I think apping a small child was a good idea</font> but if you find yourself with any concerns over the way I'm playing Cooro at any time, drop a line here!

<b>Contact:</b> I can be found on gchat/gmail at artisabang, AIM at ScarletSteps, Plurk as ScarletSteps or on IRC as Kida or Nero. E-mail or pinging the crap outta me on IRC is probably the best way to go about getting in direct contact with me. Alternately, tell Hisoka to yell at me.

<b>Availability:</b> I am generally available from 6pm - 12pm PST and almost all of the weekends.

<b>Timezone/Language:</b> I am in PST and speak the English. o/

<b>The Playing Experience:</b> I'll usually only have 1 or 2 out a day and am an average speed poster, but I am all for continuing threads for DAYS if need be. If you'd like to continue a post with me and it's my turn, feel free to give me a nudge. Sometimes I accidentally delete a notification without actually replying to the thread :D;

<b>Goals:</b> PLAY MORE I kind of fell out of the game over the last several months and I really want to jump back in because I miss you guys :(

<b>Betaing:</b> I am not the best beta ever because I suck at grammar, but I am very good at suggesting ways/scenarios to help make an app funnier. At least I like think so. 

<b>AUs:</b> I am totally up for them but looking at my current line-up... uhm. Yeah. 

<b>Pimping:</b> ... I love pimping canons at people let me touch youuuu. 

<b>Other:</b> I have a horrible attention span at times, so feel free to pester me endlessly if you need something from me."

<u>Reason For Dropping:</u> Loss of interest in playing the character. THIS HAPPENS A LOT I just have a really bad attention span and after a while lose interest in playing the character. For Ryo, it'd been happening for at least a few months before I finally dropped him; I held onto him because Ikki was the best castmate ever.

<u>Reason For Dropping:</u> Despite what I said in his dropping post, it was a combination of loss of interest in the character and voice loss that I dropped him. I get tempted to reapp him sometimes but I'm pretty sure I'll just fall into the same ditch. His TYL hair is still atrocious though. 8|

<u>Overall Pecentage:</u> 9.12%
<u>Reason For Apping:</u> IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW I initially hated Asch on my first play through the game. Hated him with a FIERY PASSION. And then I talked with Aviy about how I was playing ToA and she showed me Asch's gaiden. And then I read it and I felt horrible and I fell in love with Asch because suddenly he made SENSE to me. And I wanted him to get his own happy ending so badly. So then Aviy went 8DDD at me some more and I apped him because he is mine.

<u>Reason For Apping:</u> So a few months way before counselors, I played DMC1. And went ""wow this game is fun the characters are okay but this game is fun."" Then I played DMC3. And went ""HOLY SHIT DANTE IS MY HERO."" And then I played DMC4 and uh I think it just exploded from there, Dante was my official hero. When our current Dante got in, I wanted to play someone off of him, but even more so I wanted to play someone from the canon. Nero wasn't an option for me because he is dangerously close to Asch in >|||-ness, so looking over the remaining characters, I decided I wanted Trish for reasons that had nothing to do with her boobs.

NOTHING AT ALL.

I. Looking over this, I realized I dropped a lot of characters whose relationships/playing waned off and I do not want that to happen again so I must play my currents more, especially those who had a lot of relationships and kind of lost them ;o;b

2. I might ask specific questions about the icons! What context were they pulled from; what coloring technique you used, wtf is with those keywords, etc.
3. Make a post (including the meme info) and talk about the icons I chose.
4. Other people can then comment to you and make their own posts.</i>

<lj-cut text=""Suzuna's picks"">
<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/68583769/14026991""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/70345850/14026991""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/72249419/14026991"">

1) Doujinshi! I can't recall what was happening, but for one scene Asch drags Luke off into a corner to discuss things with him. And I thought the panel was cute so I iconned it.
2) Game canon icon, this is one of the times when Asch attempts to be suicidal and Luke cockblocks him... only to be suicidal in turn. They're retarded like that. 
3) D-Doujinshi, so I found this doujinshi about Snow White Asch and the Seven Mieus. With Jade as the evil queen and Anise as his minion. You can guess what this scene is from that. 

<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/61390222/11929189""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/72528641/11929189""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/72528551/11929189"">

1) ONCE UPON A TIME Ryo and Yukari bodyswitched. And Yukari ran into a dilemma in which Ryo did not provide the appropriate crazy faces. So Yukari drew and uploaded this icon and I am never deleting it ever. 
2) Most recent chapter of FAKE season 2! Bikky runs off to go rescue his friend, leaving the rest of his group behind. Then Ryo and Dee appear, so the kids storm Ryo to tell him what happened to Bikky. T-They call him Bikky's Nice Detective. 
3) From a little omake in the newer volumes of FAKE. Dee and Bikky end up fighting over a cookie and Ryo... essentially tells them to shut up in there he is trying to cook. While holding a really big knife. The keywords are stolen from Tot |Db

<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/54331811/11558353""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/54581901/11558353""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/59474217/11558353"">

1) I can't quite remember what was happening in this scene, but someone had just punched Tatsuha and in Gravi, bleeding endlessly from your face is totally cool. 
2) From Gravi EX! Which WHILE I SHUN GREATLY, I love for this icon. Tatsuha and Shuichi are making a break for it in order to see Yuki who is in the hospital and... I forgot why Shuichi had the shovel, he just did. 
3) So this one time in canon, Tatsuha dyed his hair blonde and popped in some colored contacts and pretended to be Yuki for Ryuichi's cell phone number. Noriko mentioned she had Ryuichi's house number and uh this scene occurred, in which Tatsuha said he would do anything she asked. I think the great part in this scene is that Noriko's eight year old kid is standing in the background watching all this.

<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/69419527/14488811""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/69439949/14488811""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/69450563/14488811"">

1) So there was an epic fight scene on a plane over Shuichi. K vs Bill and Ark. This panel is how seriously K took that fight. 
2) K likes to explain! K likes to explain things using a Kumagoro puppet, since it was the only way he could get Ryuichi to pay attention.
3) ... I can't remember what was going on in this icon, but K was despairing over something. There were artistic roses involved. 

<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/62348306/12975353""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/63013660/12975353""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/70418727/12975353"">

1) Doujinshi! Dino was glancing at someone and I just liked the angle that the panel had. 
2) ... ahahaha, uhm, more doujinshi, and I think that's Hibari's hand he's licking blood from. There was sex soon afterward.
3) Doujinshi! Tiny!Dino is adorable and fandom tends to assume that he lived in a state of permanent injury which I tend to agree with. I needed a confused looking icon, so this one worked. 

<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/65350960/13656534""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/65366432/13656534""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/67722998/13656534"">

1) Senri and Cooro were hunting for food! Cooro picked up a mushroom and asks Senri if it's okay to eat. Senri says no. Cooro goes :(. This is how 60% of their conversations together go.
2) I don't recall what exactly was going on, but one of Crystal's friends was telling Cooro what a good kid he was and there were many headpats to be had. 
3) At the end of every chapter of +Anima, there's a one-panel cartoon that has to do with the last chapter. This one came after they ran into a +Anima who was posing as an angel, so in this short cartoon Cooro rolled himself around in some flour in posed as an angel too. 

<img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/71107758/14860556""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/71226181/14860556""> <img src=""http://userpic.livejournal.com/71319636/14860556"">

1) Manga canon! Tethe'alla is a more technologically advanced world than Sylvarant. When Zelos tells Lloyd that the boat they were just riding in is inside that tiny box, Lloyd kind of disbelieves. 
2) GENIS NEEDS TO EAT MORE and Lloyd takes it upon himself to help. With a loaf of bread. 
3) Official manga art! This is actually one of Lloyd's alternate costumes in the game, when he and the rest of his party had to dress up for a little fancy party. Lloyd cleans up pretty well |D"

<b>Age:</b> <s>11 (Canon)</s> <s>12</s> 13
<b>Height:</b> 142 cm / 4'8""
<b>Weight:</b> 35 kg / 77 lbs
<b>Eyes:</b> Blackish-Brown
<b>Hair:</b> Black
<b>Medical Info:</b> Healthy like a crow!

<b>Physical Traits:</b> Cooro's pretty fit for an eleven year old thanks to all the traveling he does, but other than that he is just your typical kid. Though, on the side of each shoulder are his +Anima tattoos, which look like swirls with feather-things sticking out. 

<b>What's Okay to Mention Around Him/Her:</b> Aaaaaaanything, Cooro is sturdy.

<b>Abilities:</b> Has wings of a crow! Can fly! Also, his eyes are a little sharper than normal people's and he... has a sort of ability to sense other +Anima? Or at least, he can tell who is and isn't one.

<b>Notes for the Psychics:</b> ... See Husky's <s>mini essay</s> TWO LINES OF INFO for this. But other than the crow spirit thing, what you see is what you're getting with Cooro.

<b>Can I shapeshift/bodyswap?:</b> Of course! Contact me for the go. |D

<b>Kissing/Hugging:</b> Cooro is squishy and loveable GO FOR IT.

<b>Maim/Murder/Death:</b> S-Sad tiny +Anima, but contact me first and we can talk it over. 

<b>Cooking:</b> Proooobably one of the worst cooks in the group; he's more the type to eat things raw."

<b>Character:</b> Cooro
<b>Series:</b> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2BAnima"">+Anima</a>
<b>Age:</b> 11

<font size=1><i>Canon: Fly like a bird, run like a horse, float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. +Anima are the people who have been gifted with the ability to do just these things; they have each taken on the physical abilities and appearances of one specific animal. While they're not very different from regular humans, +Anima are the scorn of their world's society. But when life's got you down, the only thing to do is jump back up and keep going. That's what Cooro believes.

The poster boy for naivety and one of four children traveling together in search of a place where they belong, Cooro is a sweet little crow +Anima with a never-ending appetite for food and adventure. He goes along with whatever sounds appealing to him and with his attention span being equal to that of a crow's, flitting between whatever new and shiny thing that comes his way is a common occurrence. Though his innocence and agreeableness have landed him in several sticky situations, his genuine interest and insight in other people make him a much more mature person than people initially think.</i></font>

<b>Sample Post:</b>

Wooow, this is where you live? It's amazing! You can see everything from up here; it's the perfect place for a high-up hangout. I have a question though. Is all the underwear hanging out there supposed to keep us hidden? Like camouflage? I don't think it's doing a very good job if that's the case. I mean, some of it is really... small. And thin. There's even holes right in the middle of some of them, see? ... Oh, they're peepholes? Well, that makes more sense then.

I can't wait to take a better look around this area. When you asked me to be a part of your group, I didn't think it'd be this much fun! I've never flown in a flock with other birds before, and I've definitely never tried spelling out words in the sky. Some of the people down below looked angry though; a few people started throwing things at me. Did they not like what we were spelling out? What were we spelling out anyway?

... Huh? Look over where- Oh! There're people down there! They're waving at us; they look really nice! They sound like they're hungry though and now that they mention it, I'm getting a little hungry too. Is there something to eat up here? They keep saying ""ohm nom nom chicken"" while pointing up here and chicken sounds really good right now. Mmm, covered in gravy and--... <i>we're</i> the chicken? But I'm a crow +Anima and you're all toucans. I don't think we'd taste like chicken, but then I've never tried eating crows or toucans before. Hmmm, maybe we taste better!

H-hey! Where are you guys going? I wouldn't eat anyone of you, I promise! We're part of the same group now, and you never eat your group mates. There wouldn't be a group anymore if everyone ate everyone else, so there's no point to it. I'm sorry for scaring everyone though; I'll make it up to you by being the best Ceiling Bird I can be! <font size=1>How did it go again, uhm... oh, right!</font>

No person will go unwatched! No ceiling will be without eyes! ""Birds of a feather watch together"" is our motto and we'll show those cats how it's done!

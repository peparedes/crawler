"event","Today was loads, yes loads, of awesome.  I woke up really early, and fell back asleep, but then mom woke me up again and i stumbled off to the shower, crying, ok not really, but it adds some spice.  So mom leaves this morning and i tell my sister that she has to wait for me after school because i have to serve my detention.  Anyways we go to school, and of course as soon as my car stops Michelle jumps out like a parachuteist getting out of a c-130 in the heat of battle.  But its cool because i dont really want people thinking that im sitting in the car with a prostitute anyways.  So i hang out in the lot with Andrew and Ryan and we all listen to some awesome music on my stereo system (which sucks because the base is all blown out) but its ok for just killing time.  So school starts and yadda yadda yadda.  Oh yeah, after first period we had activity period today, and no-one in first period chose to tell me about it because i just got up and left when the bell rang and headed off to second period.  When i get there Mrs. Riley is like, ""Adam, you realize this is activity period right?"" so im like ""Damn"" and i head off back to first period.  When i get there everyone is laughing at me so i issue a nice ""Fuck you guys"" and its all good again.  Oh, and i saw almost the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life yesterday, not kidding, it was the FUNNIEST thing EVER.  This kid in my second period class, Tim, well, hes literally mentally retarded, but its cool and all, its not like everyone makes fun of him.  He just plays with the clay and we basically leave him alone.  So he has the hotts for this one girl in our class, and shes ""normal"" and he obviously likes her. Basically everyday he will walk up behind her and grunt a little and smile real big at her and shes like ""Good job Tim, now go sit down"" so he walks away.  But yesterday was different, he walks up behind her and grunts a little, she says her normal ""Go sit down Tim"" and he just keeps standing there.  Then his finger slowly moves to his nose and he picks out a huge buger.  And literally in slow motion he moves it toward the girl and she is utterly terrifyied, shure enough he rubs it off on her jacket, grunts a little more and smiles, then he soes and sits down.  I, as did almost the rest of the class, almost shit my pants.  So anyways back to today.  School got out and i head off towards my detention in Cassaros room, and i was very weird because i was the only kid in there, and hes obviously at least a little gay, and he kept making wise ass remarks.  So finally im like ""My sister is waiting for me in the parking lot, ive got to go give her a ride home"" so hes like ""if you want to get started with me ill just give you a refferal"" and i was like ""go ahead, im just telling you i have to give her a ride home, she cant just wander the campus"" so he let me go early.  So on my way home Katy calls me and shes all like ""I was supposed to pick you up at 2:15 and your not home, im in your driveway""  So i was like ""well im on my way ho-......"" thats when i dropped the phone because i had to do a but load of shifting. So i get home and theres Katy sitting in my driveway all revving her engine and yelling at me for not getting home early enough, ok she didnt yell.  So her and i are headed to the thrift store to find me a trench coat for this skit thing im doing with micheal and the other scout kids, its based on Jay and Silent bob, so i needed a green trench coat.  Anyways we go there and KT is like oh god we gotta go check out the kids shirt section, which is apparently where every emo kid on the planet gets his clothing because they were like tight little kids clothes, but i have to admit they were pretty cool.  Anyways we were looking through the shirts for like 20 minutes when this little kid comes up and starts going through them, so im like hey dude check this one out and i hold up a shirt that says ""i quit having sex for bowling"" and he just stared at it blank eyed then he went back to looking at shirts.  so KT and i had a good laugh then like 3 min later he holds up this shirt and says to me ""hey kid i found a gay boys shirt for you"" i just laughed uncontrolably as did KT, so the kids all proud of himself until im like ""dude that says Calvin Klien, and hes not gay"" so we argued for like 4 minutes while KT watched and laughed and finally im like ""dude your 6 years old, im like 10 years older than you, I win."" so he stomps off to find his mom. So Katy and i finish our shopping and we go over to mens to find a trench coat, we get a shitty green one and head off towards the cash registers.  By this time that little shit has had enough time to go find a girls sweater and he walks up behind me, hits me, and holds up the jacket sweater thing and says i bet you would like this gay boy.  So i was like ""wow, dude thats perfect"" I took it from him and tried it on, it was really tight and emo looking, i did feel a little gay but it was funny because the kid was obviously mad thinking that he had helped me out so he finally stomps off and KT and I continue to laugh.  So we leave the thrift place and Kt is like omfg, if i take you home im going to miss my spanish class, so i make her call my mom, and long story short im going to go to spanish class with her.  so we have like an hour to kill in fort myers, and around this time i get around to telling the aforementioned retard story, which about makes KT crap herself, which is bad because shes driving.  anyways we go to the BK lounge and get some fries and burgers, and yeah, i love fries.  so then we head off to spanish class over there at edison and we get there early, so were developing a plan to get me into her class.  I honestly liked the idea of playing a retarded half brother that she had to care for, but she didnt like that one, so we went with me being her really hot brother, i added the really hot part.  So we walk around and she gives me a campus tour, which sucks a little because she really has no idea where she is, but i did find out her favorite place to tie her shoe, and im not kidding she seriously has a favorite place to tie her shoe.  So class is about to begin and she checks her messages and calls one of em back and shes like im here hanging out with adam number three, yada yada.  Of course i dwelt on the Adam three part, it made me kinda sad inside, mostly because i'm pretty shure i'm the Adam thats known her the longest.  So i get the whole story and aparently im really Adam number two (just behind dispenza) but to the outside world im three because this other adam would feel bad, because she once said adam two (me) was a good friend, and this other adam was like ""it makes me feel good to know im one of your best friends"" and she couldnt cut him down after saying something like that.  its almost as effed up as math, lmao inside joke there kids.  Anyways we go to class and i have no idea whats going on, and im pretty shure Katy dosent either because she is basically writing notes back and forth to me in her textbook but it was good times all around, and after class we booked it outta there. then i went home and thats basically it, im shure i left out a lot but there is so much to remember you know... till next time.

"event","Yeah, today was pretty sweet, Rachels birthday! btw-happy birthday again Rach.  She got a freakin car, how cool is that?  She deserves it. Anyways, recently i have come to realize who my real friends are, David (quadnip), Andrew, I count Sheena, cause shes been real nice to me recently, and Kyle.  Rachel counts as a friend too.  But you know who sucks ass, Travis.  I'm tired of him.  I figured i would talk to him again the other day, and i did so, yeah he definately makes up a lot of shit.  He had me convinced that Rachel was out to get me and stuff, but apparently thats not true.  I know we arent going to go out again, but her and I are still friends (at least from my point of view).  But Travis is an asshole, so me=done talking to him.  Anyways,
   New paragraph for new subjects, right? I havent updated in a long time, due to my hatred of typing up my day, theres just so much to write, I think I'll forget something and i get all paranoid.  lol.  I am beginning to love school again, I think thats just because i have so many subs this week, seriously.  1st period = sub on mon and tue.  3rd = sub ALL WEEK, we just play on the computers and listen to mp3 players. and finally 7th period again sub all week, i do my math then sleep the day away (if I'm not talking).  omfg this kid Adam, i just started talking to him on aim, he is quite possibly the coolest kid ever, my friend katy (she should also be on my friends list that was previously mentioned) told me to talk to him. 

MaddoxFan666: hows it going?

DispenzaStyle1: haha, yeah, she is getting older. I guess she can be weird. But she is pretty funny too. Quick wit
MaddoxFan666: yeah
MaddoxFan666: lmao, ask her about the story about me licking a wall
MaddoxFan666: soo funny
DispenzaStyle1: ok, I will. She isn't on now, she got off all of a sudden, think her computer is messed up.
MaddoxFan666: yeah she logs on and off very erradically
MaddoxFan666: erratically*
DispenzaStyle1: yes she does
DispenzaStyle1: she also says alot of stuff randomly. Do you go to Cypress?
MaddoxFan666: no, mariner
DispenzaStyle1: are you the ones with the tarpon as your mascot?
MaddoxFan666: the um, well, its actually a triton basically a guy that looks like ""Neptune"" Roman god of the sea
DispenzaStyle1: oh, must have missed that.
DispenzaStyle1: freshmen year I wrestled at some highschool that had a tarpon as their mascot, thought it might have been you,.
DispenzaStyle1: oops
MaddoxFan666: lol, its ok
MaddoxFan666: you wrestled?
DispenzaStyle1: yeah, for that one year. Didn't do that good, but stuck with it, since I've never been good at sports, but was an amazing way to stay in shape. I put on alot of muscle that year.. now... all gone. I gotta start up again... working out atleast
MaddoxFan666: yeah, thats how it was with me and playing football, i wasnt any prodigy or anything, but i was in shape, like girls CRAWLIN all over the place, i had no idea what to do, lol.  I've always been a geek that had a lot of troubles with girls, like getting them, but since last year playing football not a problem, but i dont play this year, job and working on getting a car takes up my time.  but yeah, i sucked at the sport, but loved the stayin in shape
MaddoxFan666: um, hey whats your first name? i think if i knew your first name i could quit calling you dispenser in my mind
DispenzaStyle1: yeah, same with me. Haha, its Adam. Adam
MaddoxFan666: your name is adam?
DispenzaStyle1: Katy told you my name was dispenser? yeah, Adam
MaddoxFan666: how freakin cool
MaddoxFan666: no no, dispenza, your aim name
MaddoxFan666: my mind keeps calling you dispenser
MaddoxFan666: i dont even mean to do it or anything
DispenzaStyle1: oh yeah, haha, my last name. Its Adam Dispenza. Thats ok, everyone calls me that anyway.
DispenzaStyle1: Why is that 'so freakin' cool'?
MaddoxFan666: cool
MaddoxFan666: my names adam
MaddoxFan666: just a cool coincidence
DispenzaStyle1: really? Wow. Yeah, it is.
MaddoxFan666: yeah
DispenzaStyle1: So Adam, I really like your name. I mean, Adam does mean 'first man' and we are men.
MaddoxFan666: i hate when i tell people like the hair cutters my name, and the write me down on the list as ""atom""
MaddoxFan666: lol 
DispenzaStyle1: yep. I actually don't like the name that much. I've been signing my signature just 'Dispenza' lately, don't know why.
MaddoxFan666: hey, i can honestly say i like your name too, i mean im so infatuated with it that i have taken to introducing myself as adam
MaddoxFan666: lol thats cool
DispenzaStyle1: oh yes, our names are the best.
DispenzaStyle1: I like my last name, not my first.
MaddoxFan666: your last name is like impressionable, people dont forget it
MaddoxFan666: you need a first name like that to really set it off
MaddoxFan666: but dispenza is like a really cool fighter pilot name or something
DispenzaStyle1: If I killed a bunch of people, ate the bodies, and had to go 'on the lamb' for years, I'd change my name. I'd change it to 'Guy Bushnell'. Yeah... Guy... yeah...
DispenzaStyle1: Actually, Dispenza is a rare name. Or so I'm told
DispenzaStyle1: by my dad
MaddoxFan666: exactly
MaddoxFan666: but it has a neat ""ring"" to it, not like my last name Lytle
MaddoxFan666: pronounced light-el
DispenzaStyle1: Thats not bad at all. I actually like it. I mean, its no Dispenza, but its cool.
DispenzaStyle1: Mine is italian. Whats yours?
MaddoxFan666: lmao ""its no dispenza""
MaddoxFan666: its nordic
MaddoxFan666: you know them guys that mush sleds and talk about their fridges on commercials for beer
DispenzaStyle1: yeah
MaddoxFan666: yeah, thats where i like to pretend my name comes from
MaddoxFan666: lol
DispenzaStyle1: lol, funny stuff.
MaddoxFan666: i think its Irish though
DispenzaStyle1: People think my last name is cuban, because I'm half cuban. Its not, since my dad is actually mostly italian, and my mom isn't the husband, but yeah.

one funny ass kid, well i think you have read enough nite."

"event","Today was cool, cept for the fact that someone skipped school, (Rachel!). lol. anyways, i go to school, and im waiting for her for like 10 minutes, by myself, feeling like an idiot, lol. but its cool.  So i went to first period and did nothing, because i couldn't find my book, so the teacher was all like ""you can just listen"" yeah - I slept.  So, on to second period, again no rachel, but i hung out with my old ""homies"" at the other table, and i promised them i would return to their table, but i probably wont.  John, (the cool one) and i went outside and took a bunch of ghetto pictures (ok only one) but John called over some random chicks to take pictures with us, lol.  They came over and he was all like ""high five man"" lmao.  Ok, then on to third period, we had a sub, but i talked football with mags (the guy i was gonna hook sheena up with) and we had a good laugh at Favre getting the ball taken from him by a fan that ran on the field. then i went to 4th, listened to Mr.Lowrey ramble on about the Romans like FOREVER, but then he got on an offshoot about how we were never gonna finish our unit with the days we missed, i was like ""Quit talking about it and teach, then we'll learn it"" lol. oh well. so, then to 5th, and again, no Rachel.  But Kyle and I had a good time, we had only one assignment, to introduce ourselves in french.  So we went to lunch, and i stood behind the scene kid in line, and i couldnt help laughing, he thinks im his friend now, lmao. anyways, I ate lunch with Kyle and Marc, then Kyle and did something we havent done in forever, the old routine, lol, it was kinda fun. So then on to 6th with cassaro, we all got in on a betting pool, betting on what height everyone thinks Sammy will be at the end of the year, you know, that short kid in french, anyways, we now all have a binding contract, were all in for 5 dollars, hes 5'3"" now, i picked 5'4"" so i think i might win.  Cassaro got in on the bet to, i think thats illegal, lol.  So finally 7th with Mrs.cooke, yeah, FUN, (not). she rambled on for hours about how to multiply matricies and i slept, but again i had an Adam moment that Rachel woulda never live down.  She was talking about how we were going to have to make up our missed time over winter break possibly, then she said she liked that because our exams would be before x-mas.  Everyone was all like, ""thats bad i liked having them when we got back"", and she was like ""none of you would study over x-mas break"" then she looked directly at me and said ""well maybe some of you would study, but a very small percentage."" god i wish Rach was there, but i was kinda glad she wasn't, honestly, she would have never lived it down, lol. allright comment!

"event","This week is starting out on a good foot, well its not really a good foot, but a necessary one.  My girlfriend and I have started a ""break"" (I think), but I'm not positive.  I mean, everything is cool and all, but when my friend asked what was wrong when we werent holding hands, or talking much, she said ""We're just friends,"" and that really hurts to hear, to be honest I'm not sure if that constitutes a ""break"" or a ""break-up."" I hope to god its not the latter of the two.  But I completely understand why we need time apart, I can't really tell the whole story, because its not yours to know.  Just understand that I'm a willing participant in this break, it will make it better for her, although it will only eat me up inside.  And don't think that I don't understand that she is being eaten up inside by all the things that she feels right now, its not all about me.  So, this will be my last post until we are back together, because I will only get myself going more and more by putting it into words.  And for those who think that I'm acting cold or heartless, because thats how I feel I'm coming off, just know that I cant express how I'm feeling without getting myself into an emotional breakdown and becoming unproductive in anything, and I know that that is not what she wants to happen, because that is why I'm allowing this to happen between us, I dont want that to happen to her, so I'm holding on for her.  And it dosent help really that everyone who knows her is telling me all these things like ""She'll never go back to you,"" ""I can't see how she will get with you a second time,"" etc.  To tell you the truth people, I don't want to hear it anymore.  Maybe I'm just getting off track, and it really is just a break, but it feels so much like the end.  Deep down inside I know it isn't though.  And thats the only thread I have to hold onto, so don't tell me its a false impression."

By the way Katy, your dad was an awesome cook, and so was your mom.  anyways, I'm very confused.  I can't really go into detail here, but thats probably why this post is going to suck so much. lol. ok I'm gonna try and make it good.  I dont have any cool stories to tell.  ok this was a failure as a post, I think i need to go talk on the phone for a while and maybe feel better.  I wanna go see a movie, maybe I'll steal my moms car and go pick up david.  Whats playing these days? I dont get out much. lol.  Yeah, were getting a mall in Cape Coral now, ok not now, in THREE YEARS!  thats bullshit. Don't tell us about this crap now, tell us in 2 and a half years, when the mall is 90% complete, that would be better, now people will have so much anticipation for so long that they will end up killing themselves.  And Cape coral probably thinks that this mall will put them on the map, I'm tired of Cape Coral, were the Alabama of florida, seriously, what is there to do in Alabama, (besides wrassle alligators)? well, thats the same with Cape Coral.  Ok, im out.

I love getting notes from my girlfriend, well from anyone, but theyre espically good from her.  LOL<-I hate ""lol"" I mean it's not really that bad, but due to the number of notes i have been writing and receiving lately, I have started to accidentally use lol in normal conversation, ok ill update again tomorrow.

"event","I got a good one today. This morning (i was already at school) my pants didnt feel like they were on right, so i went into the bathroom to adjust them appropriately.  I didnt think anyone was in the bathroom so i went into one of the stalls, shut the door and pulled my pants around, trying to find the right fit.  While I was doing this i was kinda grunting and making a lot of noise.  At this point i realized that all this time, in the stall next to me, was a kid going poo.  I fugured that had I been in his place i would think it was weird that a kid in the stall next to me had walked in, made a lot of grunting noise, but not pooped or peed, I would think that he was..........well you know.  So i attempted to make things right by peeing.  But I didnt have to pee, so i tries my hardest and a little squirt came out.  Thats all i could do, now it really sounded bad from that kids point of view.  So I hasteily zipped my pants and ran out before he saw me..........................My pants annoyed me all day."

"event","Ok this is kinda funny.  I walked into my first period class and found a seat towards the right.  I was hanging out and the last bell rang, and class started.  So all was cool at this point, and the teacher suddenly got a phone call.  While she was on the phone I looked around and saw my friend Aaron sitting near the back of the class.  Now last year Aaron was going out with this cute chick that I didnt know, but he always talked about her.  So the first thing that came to my mind to do was ask if he was still going out with her.  But he was across the room and i couldn't just say it out loud so i mouthed to him the words ""Are you still going out with"" and then i used my hands to immitate ""nice boobs"" he laughed and pointed behind him, where she was sitting.  Looking at me.  Awkward."

"event","Ok now i feel like a real asshole.  And i already know what your going to say Katy, but ok.  Im sure you have heard of that girl that died in Cape Coral, she was beat up and burned in a fridge.  Pretty bad huh. well, she used to work at publix supermarket.  Acouple weeks before this thing went down, i filled out an application at publix.  You see what im getting at yet?  The day after she was found dead i was called in for an interview, as it turns out publix was holding her spot for her, when she was found dead - guess what, they had tor fill her spot.  So now im gonna be known at work as the guy that replaced that girl who died a couple of weeks ago.  Man that sucks."

Who dreams this shit up? is this shit made just to piss off guys like me?  Damn, the sad thing is that there are actually impressionable morons out there [(KT) hahahahahaha. kidding....] that believe this crap and actually spend money on overpriced jeans and shit like that just to get girls/boys/whatever.  

but I'm done wineing for now, I got a pair of Calvin's sitting at the store with my name on them."

"event","As Rogue has left the room...I am left in the room all alone with the other members of RisqueRadio...Now, everything is going all dandy...Until I made one rather bothering statement. Well...it was a simple and innocent statement...but bothering to another I suppose. Here is how the madness goes:

<Chain> * minksy{GR} yawns and wonders why no one plays H.I.M... <--- whats this shit ? it DID get played
<minksy{GR}> ?
<minksy{GR}> Sir, with all due respect...watch Your tone please. It's coming off as insulting and uncalled for language.
<minksy{GR}> Do you know who H.I.M. is? and no, i'm not aware that he was played.
<Chain> your yawn was insulting
<Chain> to begin with
<Chain> and H.I.M is His Infernal Majesty
<minksy{GR}> mmhmm...Now can you explain to me how yawning is insulting if one is tired?
<minksy{GR}> It's been a while since i've been around. So yeah, i'm not aware that people play H.I.M now. I yawn when sleepy..tis an action.
<minksy{GR}> now, once more, i will ask you politely to please watch your tone...it's uncalled for anger.
<Chain> woman.. Im not angry
<Chain> and dont demand me 
<minksy{GR}> ...i'm asking nicely, not demanding. Please, don't call me woman, girl, or girly...it's a prefrence...and i find it insulting. It's just the way i am. If You've got nothing nice to say, please refrain from speaking to me, direct all questions and comments to my Sir, GentlemanRogue. 
<Chain> go away, your annoying me
* minksy{GR} shrugs, ""Next time, please have the curtisy to request PM before doing such.""
<Chain> what do you do...
<Chain> if your on a train for example....
<Chain> or in some public place...
<Chain> and someone speaks to you...
<minksy{GR}> Sir, might I inquire something?
<Chain> do you demand they call out for everyone to hear thenm ask your permissionto speak to you ?
<minksy{GR}> if i annoy You...why do YOU keep speaking to ME...
<Chain> that whole... ""ask in channel for a PM first"" is such an onlineism thing... 
<minksy{GR}> Protocols.
<Chain> its the only way for small minded people to have any semblance of control over their sad little lives... 
<Chain> I pity those people
<Chain> you may have the last word...go ahead
* minksy{GR} sighs, ""Direct all questions and comments to GentlemanRogue, good evening, Sir.""

Now, I went to someone else in Pm... quic[K]silver...and this is what they had to say...

<quic[K]silver> so what's up?
<minksy{GR}> I need a witness, and I need someone to speak to.
<quic[K]silver> okay
<quic[K]silver> witness of.......?
<minksy{GR}> Mind reading over some logs?
<quic[K]silver> not at all
(Logs here)
<minksy{GR}> Was i wrong in my actions or words?
<quic[K]silver> nope
<quic[K]silver> not wrong at all
<minksy{GR}> Tell me..who is that jackass?
<minksy{GR}> Is he a troll?
<quic[K]silver> guess he left the buttplug in too long
<minksy{GR}> Who should I show this to?
<minksy{GR}> other than GR...
<quic[K]silver> both GR and sins hon
<minksy{GR}> ...Hmm...he made a very bad move.
<quic[K]silver> I'll let her know that chain is causing a bit of a problem
<quic[K]silver> also
<quic[K]silver> there is the booth command 
<minksy{GR}> booth command?
<quic[K]silver> lets ppl vote to kick a person ;)
<minksy{GR}> How does one use this...booth command?
<quic[K]silver> ...... /msg thedamnbot .booth nickhere
<quic[K]silver> it should work for anyone
<quic[K]silver> if not, I'll do it ;)
* quic[K]silver has ops n stuff
<minksy{GR}> you do it...i am under instructions not to start fights...
<minksy{GR}> Sir knows my attitude can be rather...unsettling towards others.
<quic[K]silver> lol
<quic[K]silver> vote !yes
<quic[K]silver> nvm
* quic[K]silver smiles sweetly
<minksy{GR}> thankyou ^^

there was more..but nothing extrodinarily bothersome or to cause conflict...just talk of women and lesbians.
Then, he comes back to me... Sigh, why don't they just leave me alone?

<Chain> is that because you cant be held responsible for your own actions ?
* minksy{GR} sighs, ""Direct all questions and comments to GentlemanRogue, good evening, Sir.""
<minksy{GR}> I follow protocol. You've nothing to say but neglectful and hateful words... I don't have time or the engery to fight. 
<minksy{GR}> You're not banned...just kicked.
<minksy{GR}> just because You're a dom, doesn't mean you should treat sub's like shit...i shan't take that type of action. There is no excuse for abuse.
<Chain> kicked by the cliqued
<Chain> the hyena mentality.... those who follow blindly
<minksy{GR}> Sir, might i ask Your age?
<Chain> what for ?
<minksy{GR}> curiousity.
<Chain> so you can tell me your old as dirt ?
* minksy{GR} chuckles, ""Quite the opposite.""
<minksy{GR}> You're defensive...why for?
<Chain> and your intrigued
<Chain> but I dont care why
<Chain> and Im kicked from RR.... so fcking what... most of the music sucks, and a fair bit of the convo is just wasted oxygen..bnut once in a while I find a little gem of a tune and go about downloading it
<minksy{GR}> By the way, Sir, I'm logging all of this.
<Chain> oh Im glad
<Chain> atleast your logs will have a sceric of honest convo in them
<minksy{GR}> Sir...why waste 'oxygen' in a chatroom?...Also, if you're just going to vent and rant, You're wasting time. Please, direct all questions and comments to GentlemanRogue.
<Chain> as opposed to page loads of dribble and cyber sex
<Chain> yeah yeah heard it all three times already...and without a doubt...hes just gonna coddle you and pat you and say...awwww poor pet... otherwise yuo wouldnt allow him to play with you
<Chain> and why waste oxygen in a chatroom... thats the question I ask myself when I see 99% of chatroom conversation
<minksy{GR}> BDSM isn't always about sex and beatings...it's about love, and the will to submit to that one person. You need to go to www.castlerealm.com and learn the true meaning of BDSM...
<Chain> oh of course...some subbies opinions of how to coddle your slut
<Chain> Im actually not into bdsm..Im into music
<minksy{GR}> uncapitalize your name then.
<Chain> I dont come here for bdsm...it makes it difficult for me to eat
<Chain> I come here f0r tunes
<Chain> and caps/lowercase is an onlineism
<Chain> so its obvious what exactly you are
<Chain> just an onliner
<Chain> a cyber whipper
<Chain> go away, your annoying me
<minksy{GR}> Tell me..where do you think we are? Online, or talking in real life across the table?
<minksy{GR}> You tell me to go away, but you in all honesty wont' shut the hell up.
<Chain> you wouldnt be sitting at my table if it was r/l
<Chain> your a female
<Chain> your place is on the floor
<Chain> now scram
<Chain> have the last word...go on..I know you want to
* Chain feels generous today
<minksy{GR}> Ignored.
* Added chain!*@* to ignore list

Only question now is...Did i do the right thing? Was i a good girl in my responses?..."

"event","Well, for those of you reading this, then you will understand completely what I mean when I say, Church. I would like to thank Kyrie, Patrick, Tonya, Richard, Batty and Travis for the marvelous time I had last night. The evening, to the best of my memory, goes a little something like this. This is (in paper form) 3 pages long. So sit back and get comfortable. This will take a while.

I woke up Sunday morning at about 12pm. The first thing I did was got up and got showered up. The next step was to contact Kyrie, seeing as she was my ride. Talked with a few friends before she showed up to the house at about 6-7ish. I ran out the door, wearing my (in my opinion)hunter green militaristic like dress. In the car already were Kyrie, Richard and Tonya. I let them know my curfew was 3am(Unless I called for more time). We went out to the Greyhound bus station and picked up Patrick. Apparently they screwed him over in the whole mess of things. See, he was supposed to be gone already (not that I don't mind that he was still there and everything), however, due to the series of events in his life, he would be joining us in the outings to the Church.
First we went to Oaklawn. Richard and Patrick had a beer while Tonya and I went to the bathroom to get all dressed up. Well...to really dress <i>me</i> up. Unfortunately we didn't have any make up on us. Next time I will get make up, hopefully...I really need to buy some make up after I get a job. Kyrie was off in the bookshop part of the Cross Market cafe.
Our next stop, on the outing was to a place called Odyssey. It was an adult sex shop. The police outside were nice and I showed them my Ids. Needless to say, I didn't really need to see all that I did. Granted it did help me further learn about the world around me...But, in all honesty, I dont' see the point of ever going to one. Even the <i>arcade</i> wasn't of my fancy. The only arcade that I personally want to see...is one with games. I'm a very estranged person. I'll say this about myself... I'm cute, adorable, playable (meaning I will go along with dress up games and such; I'm friendly, out-going, drug-free, and a social drinker (this doesn't mean I'm very social when I drink.) Don't talk to me online, unless you're fully on good terms with me. I'll rip into you like a cheap suit. I'm not a nice person online... All my defenses go up and I can be a <i>very</i> different person. 
Finally, we were off to the Church. I've had to re-schedule 3 diffrent times to get to come to this place. I've had to wait 7-8 months to have my chance to even step foot on the grounds. This was my night, it was my time to live and see the place I so desperately sought.
Kyrie showed me around the building. Showing me the lounge, a small dance floor, the main dance floor, the porch where smokers smoked outside... Granted in this place, I soon noticed that you could smoke <i>anywhere</i>. The smoke didn't really bother me, and to be quite honest, it was a bit relaxing. The way people dressed, as I looked and walked around with my dear Kyrie, was eccentric, unique, and positively beautiful in its own special way. I am quite glad Kyrie let me borrow her grey dress. It was a bit fitting for the place I was at, and in her words... ""Here, it's not a matter of what you are... but rather who you want to be."" The music was loud and the pople were very friendly and nice. Felt like home to say the least...

I don't remember much of what happend. But what I do remember, I put all efforts into saving it in my memory. I asked Batty the traditional question, and well...that was quite the experiance all in its own. Watched my sister, Tonya, get flogged by anotherman other than her boyfriend, Richard. After that, Richard was the one getting flogged by, what appeared to be a Domme dressed in a full elastic, plastic, (I want to say leather but I don't think it was) kind of body suit.
The dancing was very lovely, and oh how I loved to be on the dance floor. It took Kyrie, Tonya, and Richard at least 5-10 minutes to break me out of my little shy shell. But I was comfortable dancing with them. Finally, I was okay dancing with just Travis. But that's the thing... I had to be dancing with someone, or I'd feel alone. Kyrie told me, ""It's all in the hips"" and she was right. Richard took my hips and started to help me learn how to sway with the music, because sometimes, just watching isn't enough. It was a hands-on learning experiance.
At one point in the dancing, they had a ""Sexy Beat"" going on. Since there was this guy named Will, doing a tease up on stage. Nothing but the shirt really came off but it was quite intresting watching anyways. During this Sexy beat, Travis and I started to dance together, until at one point where we were close...and I mean <i>close</i>. Our bodies were pressed together and swaying with the music. It was fun, but...god the mood...(Forgive me this is a bit hard to explain) the mood was set right...the heart was in the right place...the beat, the moving, the rhythm the heated dancing...I can't say I blame him when he came down and I was looking up at him, my back on his chest and he came down to kiss me. That's when I noticed what he was going to do and intentionally looked away. I'll admit, and be quite honest here... that I had to hold back from doing it myself. When dancing, I felt free and alive, and it seemed oh-so right to do... But mentally...I knew what would probably occur if I did allow myself to get kissed, in a possible passionate way (dancing or not) 1. Possibly re-kindle old feelings. 2. Send the wrong message (that I want to get together now) 3. I might find myself trying to open the relationship at this point in my life. And why? Just because of a kiss...Yes, I'm quite the emotional attach. Even if he didn't read into the kiss, I would. I would grow attached again and find myself in pain for being alone. I've learned to cope with being alone. To give or receive a kiss would/could possibly break me. I know that I'm in a huge risk when in a hated moment such as dancing. That isn't to say I am not happy with Travis as we are now. I enjoy the friendship we have now. I wish to have it remain where it is. I know that relationship could have just crumbled right there. I wasn't about to allow that to happen, not for just a heat of the moment thing.
Travis and I got to catch the end of the first showings for the corsets. Since tht was the event for that night. God I'm so happy I got to go and see it. A while later I got to catch the whole showing of the Corsets. Beautiful fashion show if I do say so myself, god the women were so beautiful. Granted it was a new thing to see with women having their hair in different styles and colors along with the different styles of corsets on their bodies. My mom wasn't all for me coming out to the church that night. Simply because she saw the flyer that said, ""Fit to be Tied"" which is the name for the corset event. She almost got to raise hell. But she didn't get too far.
Majority of my time was spent with Travis and Kyrie. They made sure I was happy and having an enjoyable time. In which I was. It was well worth the wait and I wouldn't have asked for anything more or less out of that night. Everything was superb and perfect, that is the best night of my life. I can't really recall a time I have had more fun. Well, in a group setting that is.
As the night carried on, Kyrie, Richard and Tonya left to go home to catch their curfew. I stayed behind with Travis and Patrick. Called home once to catch for more time, used Batt's cell. I owe Batt, and I hope there is something I can do to repay him. Such a sweety, and it's always good to see him.
I met a girl; her name is Alieia. She was pretty, nice and fun. She wants to play make up with me and work out with me. I'm all up for it, besides, I've been meaning to go and work out anyways...I just never really had the chance. Also, met a guy named Hector... Well, kind of intresting how I met him. You see, before Kyrie and her group left... Kyrie, Tonya and I had agreed to give him [Batty] a picture. It wasn't till the last moment where I fully understood what the picture would entail. In all, I wound up flashing the people out on the porch with my sisters. One...two...three...FLASH! I had a bit of a problem getting them back in. I met Hector a few minutes afterwards from the pictures. Apparently he had taken a picture of us on his Cell phone. Fun o.o;.
As we were about to leave, we got Patrick...who was with a friend who was sobering up. Since she was drunk. He wouldn't leave until he knew she was safe.  So we are waiting for her ride/person/thing to get off the dance floor. The ride disappears from the floor resulting in Patrick searching for him, in which 2 minutes later he shows up with the ride. We head out; go off into somewhere near Beltline and Josey Lane. We get to Patrick's friends apartment, where he will be staying. Head out from there and heawd home, and on the way home, we stop at a Donut shop and I had some coffee with two chocolate donuts. Yay for food!... Yay for Donuts! Come to think of it, it has been quite a while since I've gotten to enjoy freshly baked donuts.
By the time I get home it's about 10 minutes after 5. My curfew was 4:30. Usually I have about a 30minute leeway. I told them it was Patrick that was drunk and that we wouldn't let drive home and instead we gave him a ride. Because, I know they would be really... upset if I told them the whole story. Besides, I'd rather have a girl get home safe rather than push Patrick into the car without caring for the girl. And to have Patrick get to his place. Even if it did get me in trouble.
I got Travis to get away from the house as soon as possible. Seeing as my mom was waiting for me already, outside, bitching about how I'm late. Mom was being pissed while dad was reasonable. I told him what pretty much had happend. I told them of how Batt let me borrow his Cell. How Patrick left his cell with Kyrie and how Travis still hasn't gotten a new Cell. How I didn't have a chance to really make a phone call and how everything went down.
If mom would lighten up, maybe I could tell her more. Maybe, just mabye I wouldn't have to make small white lies to protect my friends as well as my own hide. Mom doesn't put nearly enough trust in me. She thinks I'm some little, pot smoking, slut who makes it a habit to be late. I don't mean to be late. But usually when I am I call in, when I'm ABLE. I'm not always having the chance to make a phone call. Mom has a way of doing this 'I told you so' snide crap. How god forbid I should get some freedom. Thank god dad is around to help me out. She is, in a way, just like Linda. She can be a royal pain and unreasonable. But, it was worth it. 
All in all, the night was a success and I'd love to go back to the Church as soon as possible. Hopefully sometime near Con... I mean, why not on June 5th?"

"event","Well, I've been quite bored. That and I wanted to start doing some organizing. So, I started writing down every pokemon card that I had...By hand, On by what 
#, Name, Rarety, Type, # of extra cards, Gymleader, Rocket, Japanese, or Holographic. 

So, I've been fairly busy. Hmm...Hung out with Kyrie on Wednsday. Had alot of fun. Concidering Tuesday was a shit-bag day. 

Hmm...Today I had 2 Big cups of coffee...think of Starbucks Large cups. Filled with Coffee and sugar and milk. I had run around in my second period, looking for a teacher with more coffee...Within the first hour I was done with my first cup. I was licking the insides wanting more. So, I found a teacher and got it. Let's see... 

Also, I worked for 2 hours on my Math...on one problem looking for the answer. The diffrence between the Bank statement and the reconcilation paper. My teacher didn't know it. I was in a nervous break down. I was out of coffee and I had nothing to eat all day.  

Finally got out of school and (yes I had finished the math) Got a watermellon snowcone and came home. I don't remember much after that. 

Found out I'm nominated to be the Army of the Princess's Princess this year! Yay! I hope I get it. ^^ Ahh...hmm.. Let's see...Talked to friends and I am organizing shit for my birthday!

Oh yes, Tomorrow I get my state Id. Hope that all works out. I dunno what I want for my bday... Other than DDR, Truffles or snowcones. I don't know. I just want to be with friends and hang out. Also, to go to the church and have fun. Possibly even see Batt. 

Well, that's all for now

"event","Well, lets see...this friday I went house hunting with my friends. Had dinner at a panda buffet and had crab legs, crawdads, beef and brocoli, meat on a stick, sushi, and icecream. Rather good. Picked up sarah from her grandmas  house.

Saturday, Dj's mom picked a fight with me and she was intimdated by me. Why, I don't know...She not only came into my friends apartment and bitched at her about the apartment. But then proceeded to blame me for not helping them at all. Now, if you know me...You know of my cleaning habits in other peoples houses. Rather rude bitch. At any rate... All was settled and everything is fine now. I am off to get settled back into my neck of the woods.

"event","Well...I know I should have been updating sooner...We just know how much you love to hear about my life... *Rolls her eyes*

<b>External Conflict:</b>
Today I was testing and I met a girl. She knew Japanese (both spoken and written) and she loves anime, along with being able to do very good art. Incidently, I figured she looked familiar...Because she is the sister to Amanda, whom of which is Jeremy's girlfriend. So, much fun there. After the test we talked more and did more art while listening to the teacher. I had to tell her all about the furfandom. Though, we never brough up Jeremy...Amanda once or twice...but the rest was more on animes and art. I like her. I gave her my contacts and what not...Hopefully I didnt' freak her out too too badly... <.< >.>

<b>Internal Conflict:</b>
<i>Physically</i>: Blah...Other than that, my back is in mind shattering pain and if I move, breathe, eat, or anything of the sort that isn't sitting still up right(and even then it hurts to a point), or just laying down on my back straight...Then I'm in mass pain. It may not look it, because I can hide it...among other things... Also, my back packs shoulder strap broke so now I took off the strap to my small purse and attached it to my backpacks handel and now I'm dragging it around school like a fat, stubborn dog. I'm rather proud of it...but...it's still not good for the back...I need a backpack with rollers...going to see if my aunt can help me with that. She mentioned about helping me out...and I will have to take her up on the offer. 

<i>Mentally...</i>: I can't really say for sure how I feel...and I'm not about to put how I really feel down in here. If I want to talk about it...or mention it...I'll talk to you. If not, deal with it and leave the subject alone. IF you're reading this...I'm going to guess you have a pretty vauge idea of what the hell I'm babbling about. Well...you can bring it up...But, don't be surprised if I'd rather not talk about it. No offence..just some people I don't want to talk to about it.

Love to all those out there who watch out for me and help me(You all know who you are ~.~)God knows I'd probably snap without it. Blah..."

"event","Today was normal...Day in day out kind of same shit diffrent day. However, things around that today haven't been so grand. Well, for good news, I got Kilala today. Big brother, Will, bought it for me as an early b-day gift to replace the one I ""lost"". Unfortunately my parents went apeshit, to a point, when finding out that it was Will who sent it. 

Now, for those who don't know Will, he is my big brother, and happens to be married. He isn't my brother by blood, but more of an adoptive pack brother. But, since he is married, apparently to my parents it is a sign of him flirting with me and is wanting to have an affair with me. Even when you explain the reasons why he bought it, and give them all the details needed to make them feel a bit better about the guy...Well, they don't listen. They are full of ignorance and won't listen to reason. They, by the way, don't even know Will or Ann, his wife. Now, I have no physical attraction to my brother. Nothing outside of a little sister adoring her big brother as a role model. Someone to look up to, who you go to for advice when things just don't seem to be going the right direction that day. I would never dream of being with him, in that type of relationship. It would seem incestuous to me. And that my friends, would be a rather disturbing image.

To go on I played some Step-Mania, and then talked to Breezy. I have yet to inform you all...that my Dom has decided to take a small vacation. 

But, this kind of vacation bothers me, if he is on one at all. For the past three days, I have not heard a word from him. Not online, not through phone (Lord knows I tried calling him enough times, but..alas no answer.), and not in person (obviously...). This, probably wouldn't bother me as much, had he told me what was going on. And for the fact that on Sunday, around 12- 2 pm he told me, that he would call me back later on in the day...and then promised it. So, I'm just a bit concerned. And yes, a part of me does want to bop his head for being such a dork(I agree with Breezy that guys can be dorks at times). Although, I love him all just the same. So, 72hrs and going...I'm somewhat worried. But, Breezy reassures me and I do my best not to worry. 

Hmm...talked to Rouge, and that was alot of fun. Yes, got into an argument...Managed to piss him off. Now he probably won't want to talk to me for the rest of the night. I can't really say I blame him. Most of it *is* my fault. I really should have kept my damned mouth shut. Maybe in due time he can forgive me. I can only hope, he really is a nice friend. Even if I do crack too many old jokes with him...

Lovely days...
Thank You To:

<b>Liz & Dj </b>- For being my friends for the past year and a half, maybe 2 years now. Or close to it. For giving me a place to rest outside of my home. For starting up my new family, my pack. And, thankyou for my little neice Sarah, even though she spits up on me, I still love her and I will always help you out with her if you ever need it. No questions asked, just request for me and I'll be there in a heartbeat(Erph..depending on the ability to get transportation. But if It came down to it, I would walk).

<b>Kyrie & Patrick</b>- For being there for me and keeping me safe. Helping me get over bad relationships and teaching me about the world. I remember October 5th, when I had so much pain...You two had shown up and were there for me, when I needed you the most. And you kept me safe and even helped me get settled into a nice relationship with Talis.

<b>Talis</b> - For picking me up as your little sub/gf and helping me learn things along the way, I've made quite a bit of progress. I love you dearly, and I dont know what I would do without you around. All I know, is that I am a very lucky girl, to have someone like you around.

<b>Will, Brandon, Breezy, Richard and Tanya</b>- You all are fairly new to me, but you have each made a special impact on me in my life. 

Each and every one of you I just listed are in my pack. But in a diffrent spot. If you want to see my little Pack List I'll be more than happy to show you.

<b>Rouge, LostPuppy, Garr</b>- Even though you arn't in my pack. You three, have also made nicely sized impacts. Rouge and Lost you both talk to me at night when I need someone there with me because of the nightmares and the sleep troubles. And Garr, your infinate wisdom and requests of art are always helpful.

You're a studd, and its a damn shame that you're gay, simply because I won't ever get a shot with you. Ah well, shit happens. Atleast I can still be your ever lovin'#1 fangirl and stalker.

"event","Well, lets see... Hmm...all the events of last night eh? Well, it was pretty fun.

When I got out of school an hour early, Talis picked me up after school, just a wee bit late. After that we went to a 7/11 and got some pocky(Strawberry), two bottles of bawls, mt.dew, and two taquito(sp) thingys... 

Next we went off to putt-putt and played some games and got some tickets. I played DDR in my nice boots...God that wasn't the smartest thing to do, but atleast I passed the games. Once I put Abyss on x3 and damn it all... It was on standard too. I had to hold onto the back railings or I'd fall over and hurt myself even more so than I was already. Now that we were done at Putt-putt we had to figure out something else to do. 

So, we went to Kyrie's! She wasn't home... However, Richard, Tanya, Chemical and Melissa were there. So, while waiting for her we worked on Richard's Mazda Miada! Oooh, gotta love that Miada. Anywho, the next thing you know Chemical and Melissa left. So, we still worked on the Miada. Then we got some icecream from the icecream truck. Got my favorite, a Screwball. Went around town getting the right parts for Richard's Miada. Humm..., then Kyrie finally got home. I glomped her! I missed her alot. Richard sent Tanya and myself to the Kroger across the street. We got a gallon of water. I think that's right. But, on the way there Tanya gave me a piggy back ride! That was fun ^^. Then when we got back Tanya had me put on a Militaristic dress. Dark, hunter green kind of dress. Then, Richard and I went to get the Miada cleaned at the Serve yourself carwash. Whee! Afterwards we went to the Mall parkinglot...Oohh, gods how fun that was. I couldn't stop giggling for about 15 or so minutes, feeling the thrill of it all was...sensational. We got back to the house, talked for a bit longer, and then Talis took me home.

With absolutely nothing to do, I played on the StepMania for a few hours. Called up Jim and talked to him for a bit, talked to my ex and had a fairly *intresting* conversation. Tried to get in contact with Talis, succeeded once, and then the next time I tried I figured he was gone. 

My dreams, came up to be a nightmare.

I had to fight gigantic spiders, with a small fly swatter. Try to protect the food from this spider. Next thing you know the souls of my friend and the spider switch bodies and the dream shifts to a completely diffrent area.

The Gods sitting in an VIP box were watching their people of an arena. They were all angry at the dinosaurs. Apparently the dinosaurs were eating too many of the other species. The species that had been attacked, had called on their gods to show up and have a meeting. Four of them shown up. 

The first was Zeus, he looked like Zeus from the Disney movie ""Hercules"".  The second, was the God of the onis. The demon's skin was purple, smooth like silk and she had two horns that formed from the front of her temples and curved to the back of her head where the horns pointed out. Her hair was raven black color and the eyes were dark emerald green. She was in a beautiful dress. She was wearing something that looked like a dark blue corset and the bottom part was a mid-thigh skirt, same color as the corset.  The Third was the Ogre god. He appeared to be a midget green oger. Not very intimidating. Think of warcraft's big ugly green guy on the cover. Looked exactly like that, only 4'5.  Then, last but not least, the fourth God. He was a fish god, and he appeared to look like that fish guy out of Hellboy. 

The arena looked like that of a Roman gladiator arena. The species were gathered in it crying out for justice and for a great wall to be built to keep the omnius dinosaurs and their god out. Zeus had the evidence, and he filled the arena's fighting area with the bodies of the slain. The other gods were horrified and  all made an agreement to have this wall built. 

That's when the dinosaurs attacked. They heard the verdict and they wanted revenge for being kicked out. Not having been able to state their case as they were carnivores, they couldn't help it. It wasn't their fault. When the war was over, most the dinosaurs had died. (Most of them tried to rape the other species, fill them with their seed to make sure their species didn't die out. Fucked up method, but it worked.) I was there, don't know why, but I was. Two dinosaurs that looked like triceratops, only cuter, picked me up, since I had a horn, (apparently I was a oni species) and took me in as their own. 

Then I hear a narration talking of when the dinosaurs sent me out on my own. I was sent onto a boat in a dark and murky watered area. Probably infested with water moccasins. Up until this point, the dinosaurs and others had been just merely toys. Now, they were actual life sized figures and appeared as real. Back to the dream, they, my ""parents"", gave me an ore and I started to row. 

Somehow I managed to get into town and that's when I saw Talis. I clung to him and we got icecream and started to talk. When I pulled away from him to look at something, four men had shown up. Two big black men, and two smaller but equally as tough white men. They looked like Will, Batt and the other two were just...cute. I can't say they really looked like anyone I knew. I got back up and started to reach for his arm in my usual clingy way and they told me to stop, that they would take care of me now and they would help me away from him. But, I didn't *Want* to be away from him. They were about to shoot him down...
Well, I couldn't have that, so I stepped infront of him, Talis, and hugged him tightly. I told them to leave him alone, and they looked dumbfounded. Nodded and left us alone. 

Next thing I know the phone rings and I wake up. Humm...odd really. 

To all my friends who went to the church last night, I hope you had fun =^.^= lots of love to you all. ^^ Now all thats left is to get in contact with Talis. Because I miss him, and I always worry about him when he goes out."

"event","Today, I was thinking all day about my father, and about my dream. I really do fear for him. I don't want anything bad to happen. More than likely if something bad does happen...I'll know it, but I won't admit it. I'll probably clam up into a shell and try to think its all a nightmare. Today, I had some friends come over.
Jeremy came over and put in some new songs for my Step Mania, and we had fun talkin and what not. A bit later Deidre came over, and we had a nice conversation ( I really do enjoy her company. Me thinks I shall dub her a 'Big Sister'). When she was about to leave, we were outside...and that's when I saw the ambulance... Gods how many flashbacks and thoughts flooded my mind.

Thoughts of the last time an ambulance was on our street played in my mind. The thought of them having problems trying to get my great grandmother into the ambulance. Since the hallways were kinda small. I was around the age of 12, I think... sounds about right. I was working with my father on the desk we built together in the living room...and then the ambulance arrived. She went to the hospital and never came back. I remember being in the hospital room, I was aware of what was going to happen... But I was afraid, I wasn't fully comprehending it as a bad thing. My dad cried for days and days. I love my daddy.
Then I remembered the little old lady next door. She was very helpful to me during Jr.High, and when I was a kid I'd help sweep up her leaves into trashbags. She must be in her 90's now...or late 80's... Small, little old woman, but a dear sweet woman. The ambulance was infront of her house...

They, the medics, wheeled her slowly into the ambulance and for 15minutes, I stood outside with Deidre watching them. Wondering why they wern't going fast. She told me it was because it wasn't an emergancy. At that moment, I was curling into a shell, slowly, I hate to see death. It makes me sick, It floods my mind and pervokes fear and sadness to occur. I clung to her...and just wanted them to put her back in the house and drive away. Never show up again... Never show up on the street again. She calmed me down, I'm happy she was there to help me out. 

A while later, Talis shows up and he and Jeremy go on to talking about something that is beyond me...Some online game,... I think... At anyrate, Jeremy left, and Talis and I stayed home and talked some more and whatnot. 

Now, I'm sittin' here and trying to figure out what I should do to prepare myself for if anything does happen to my father. (Although I don't think anything will or can happen to him) I've been told, if I don't prepare...it could eat me alive...and I know it's true.

I love my daddy."

"event","Well, for some apparent reason lately I've been wanting to do some quizzes. So I'm going to post them here so that I can get it completely out of my system... But first...

I want to talk about my dreams lately. They have been making me rather sad. Just last night I had dreams of my daddy falling over and not getting back up... Just laying there, I was clinging to him...crying for him to get back up but he wouldn't. Just wouldn't move. Right before my eyes, my father died infront of me. For those who don't know me, then let me explain about my father. He is really a grandfather, but raised me as his own, I call him dad. He is 63, gone through around 5 heart attacks, 3 or 4 strokes and under a double bypass surgery a few years back. He has lost vision on the side of his eyes and he's a bit senile. To add onto this he is very weak lately...very weak. I really am worried about him. I love my daddy. 

On a brighter note, onto the quizzes.

"event","For those reading this, I suppose you know fairly well of me being out this weekend. So, lets start from Wednsday evening, after school. But, before I start, go grab a snack or a drink. This is going to take a while to read...

On Wednsday I got invited by my best friend, Liz and her husband, DJ, to come over for a lan party Saturday night. I said sure and then Talis came over. We hung out and talked on his break, I watched him leave. When he was out of sight I went back inside. About 15 minutes later our neighbor said she saw a red pick-up truck with a short bed back into our drive way and when she came out to check her mail and look at the truck, our mailbox was down. From the middle of the pole and up, was off. Lucky us, we got vandalised.
Later that night, I got invited by Jeremy to go to Tornado Terries with him on saturday. I told him my plans and he asked about Friday. I said sure. After that I asked Kyrie, Will and Ann if they would like to come along. Unfortunately, they had plans and prior engagements...But, hopefully we will all have a chance to go together at a later date.
(Skipping Thursday)
Friday, as you know I went over to Jeremy's house. It goes well the first few minutes, and then his sister walks in. She appers to be 18 or 19, total bitch... Starts to bitch about the 'woe is me' and how Jeremy is a horrible person. She showed total disrespect and yelled at her own mother. Saddly, as I was observing, the mother has no dicipline over her daughter. Fighting infront of company... At any rate, we finally made it to the arcade. After going through a really bad and negative mood and event. By the end of the night my legs are really hurting and I find that my ride didn't show. So instead of calling home and going through all that fun hastle, I call up Kyrie. She comes and gets me. On the way home we were talking. Geebus, how I have missed her. I told her everything that had happend in the week. (Kyrie is one of the few people I would take a bullet for without a second thought or hesitation. )I told her all about Deidre and what was happening with all that goodness. I was thinking that perhaps next Sunday that Travis, Kyrie, Deidre and myself, should all get together. 
When I got home, O got online and Travis asked me where I had been. He had been worried about me. Oops...erm...kinda forgot to tell him where I Was going to be that night. I was kinda happy to hear he was worried... It showed me that he really cared for my well being. Granted there wasn't a doubt in my mind that he cared in the first place...
Saturday, I got up and got showered then headed over to Liz's. We worked on the dishes and washing clothes. When Liz was starting to vaccum, Talis arrived and he was on a break. Spent an hour and a half with us. During that hour this is what ensued:
We got Isis(The dog, other wise known as 'Cow'), to attack the vaccum after sucking up her nose into it. Sucked up on Ash's(Fat cat) tail, and Carrot(small cat), wasn't stupid enough to go near it. She had seen what happend with Isis and Ash.
Next, Talis picked me up and held me in the air. First by having me sit on his shoulders and the next by flipping me upside down.
When he went to work we got back to working on the house. An hour or two later Scott came over and everyone was having a good time. Justin messaged me and I told him all about the mailbox incident..He offered to fix it and I thanked him. I told him I would let him know the answer by Monday. He is a fairly sweet guy, just... I'm not entirely sure why he dislikes me. They say its possible that he just can't put up with my naive self. Liz and I went to the store and picked up a few things. Around 1a.m., I  had them latched onto Foamy and then Scott left. Liz and I were up till 5a.m. folding and putting up clothes, while managing the baby.

Sunday, I came home around 7a.m. and went back to bed, till around noon. I got up and got ready.  Hopped online and got to make the plans for that days events. I made decisions and when Talis finally came over we went to Putt-Putt to wait for Deidre.  Right before we walk in, she calls us. We went in and played some games while waiting for her. Which resulted in many pictures when she did get there. We dragged her onto the DDR. While on the machine, Talis picked the songs, and then took pictures of us while we were playing on it (After I get the pictures I'll post them into here). After the DDR we went to the teashop, never have I seen so many bikes. Hehehehe..., ahem...anyways, we got tea and smoothies. Deidre upped for Sushi for dinner and so it was decided. So we talked to Skipper and he told us of a nice sushi place. The resturant was a buffet, many diffrent types of sushi!  It was really good. But a few times I got over heated. Deidre took care of me and got me all fixed up. I really do like her, alot. On the way back, she was going to drop me off at my house but I asked that we go back to the cars. You see, I wanted to talk to Talis about something. Something really good. So we got to the parking lot and we were about to swap cars and she said she would go out to Starbucks that night. He wished to accompany her so...Yeah, I wasn't able to talk to him about it. But we got alot of pictures and got to talk alot and I got to be petted and what not. Even though I lost my shot to tell him that night, I have found that waiting makes it that much sweeter. 
I came in, got online and talked to Rouge. Waited for Talis to call but he never did. Ah well, perhaps today I'll talk to him...I hope so. I was up till 3am talkin' to Rouge about his ideas of a 5 year plan. And other various things...I don't remember exactly. I loved that day...It was one of the best days of my life, and I never wish to forget it.

That was my fun weekend. Hope you enjoyed."

"event","Well, morning was a pretty okay morning, except for the children. Mmm, harassment in the morning. Well, first period the teacher leaves the room and the class is 8 people, including myself. Well, 6 people start talking and thats fine. I have no problem with that, but they start cracking racist jokes and start getting a little too loud. Now, when the voices bother me to the point of where I can't even hear myself think...That's a problem. So, I simply turned around and asked in a nice tone, ""Could you please lower your voice, I'm trying to concentrate."" 
Well, to them that's obviously offensive, cause the next thing I know this little preggy bitch (who might I add, appeared no older than 15 and said, a few minutes prior, that she didn't know who the babies daddy was), says to them, ""Come on yall, be quiet. She'll probably tattle on us if we don't.""  
Now *I'm* offended, so I responded a bit annoyed, ""You really don't know me, so don't talk about me in such a slanderous way.""
Smartass... she says back to me, ""Well, you don't know me so don't you talk about *me*. Don't you go pissing me off. If you listen to music how come you can't stand to hear us."" Little dipshit... I wasn't talking about her in the first place. 
Ooh, lovely, I responded...as calmly as I could. This little bitch was working my nerves. I'm not a morning person. ""There is a diffrence between music, and noise."" I turn back around to continue my work and she keeps going. 
Nate, probably jokingly, he's another classmate, fairly nice guy but sometimes just a dipshit. This was one of those times, he so nicely chimes in, ""Careful, she(hes referring to me) is going to bring a gun!""
I turned around and was like...what? While I was turning around she chips into that, ""Oh let her, I'll kick her ass.""
So I responded once more, unfortunately I have a problem with holding my tounge. ""Idiot, I'm a pacifist. I couldn't ever be able to do something like that..."" But boy howdy I would sure find it amusing to think about it. Fortunately, for them... I'm non-violent outside the ring.
Little hoochie...""What's a pacifist?""
""It means I'm non-violent...""
""Uh huh, yah sure whatever... Shut up. Shut up, shut up."" She didn't even let me finish my sentance. God that's annoying. 

Now, isn't this the reason why I got out of Harwood(Jr. High which I was taken out of due to lack of ability to co-exist with others)? To flee stupid people like this? People who can't comprehend an opinion not their own? To them, the *opinion* another human may have on the same subject, if it doesn't agree with their own opinion, then they arn't right. Their opinion is wrong. But wait! Isn't that what an opinion is? An opinion is a thought or feeling towards something : an idea, object or subject.
Which brings me to why I *hate* adolescent, immature children. If they are younger than 16, more often than naught, they are immature and ignorant.  However, there are *Some* That know better than to pull this stupid shit. 
I have to admit, most of the younger generations *Do* think they have all the answers. Because of this, at times, they are ignorant, know nothing CHILDREN. 
Well, that's my two cents on this."

""No use trying to fight it, you're an eight-sided die, a d8. A fine example of simple elegance, the d8 is one of the least appreciated types of dice, and is often neglected. You are known to be quiet and shy, outward traits that conceal viscous sarcasm and mean wit. You are very smart, yet wise enough to hide your intelligence the quicker they found out how smart you are, the sooner they'll put you to work, which is something you can do without. People call you dark and pessimistic, or moody and cynical. You find little point in arguing.""

Next, I want to make it perfectly clear that the past week I have been away. Infact, I am long over due for a post. So here it goes.

Friday I went to a party. Hung out with friends and had a rather enjoyable time. Saturday, everything is blanked out of my mind and I don't remember a thing. Sunday I hung out with my Dom and then went over to Liz's and spent the whole week at her house.
 Sunday evening Dj, Liz, Talis(My Dom), and I went out to the super Asian buffet and had a rather enjoyable lunch. 
What happened next was that Talis and I went out to this little asian cafe to meet this girl. He already knew her, she had the hots for him and pretty much came down to me having to talk to her about seeing maybe if I was comfortable with her becoming a new subby under Talis. I'm glad I get a choice and an opinion in the matter. It makes me feel alot better. Knowing that hes not about to pick up another woman without my okaying it. Well, we talked about it prior to all this and I had made it clear that I'm uncomfortable with most women and I'd like to approve of them. 

So, after having an enjoyable evening with the girl, her friend and my Dom, I have to admit it was a bit uncomfortable. I mean, I'm okay with the quite a bit of kissing. Come to think of it, she kissed him alot of times on the cheek, and he kissed her back on the forehead and on the cheek. I didn't know how to feel. It was all calm, and somehow I was a little jealous and a little okay with it. Balanced out. Quite possibly because I felt somewhat sedated. However, it was odd... I like her alot, I really do. She's a sweet girl, but in the group I feel kinda... outside. Like I'm there but I really don't fit in.  Everyone seemed to be on a diffrent level. In truth I felt a wee bit stupid compared to all of them. 
I'm not sure if I can handel her being in the group. Being a new subby. I want to get to know her a bit more. So that its not an act. I want to know its how she really is. 
You see, first appearances are everything. However, when you do this first appearance thing you can lead someone on to believe someone you arn't. Appear to be all nice and sweet...and then once your in...BAM. Complete change and total bitchery. I don't want that.
...I don't want to be abandoned again...
He promised me, before we got in, that he wouldn't abandon. That he wouldn't go unless I wanted him to. That was really comforting. 
I want to trust her. I really do, she is a wonderful girl, from what I've seen. But, I would really like to get to know her more. 

I've also decided something. If I were to ever become sexually intimate with him, I would want a pill, condoms and a HIV test. Along with if she were to become sexually intimate with him too, I want test results for her too. I don't need them because well.. I'm a virgin. I haven't ever had sex. Sexually transmitted diseases... But, if they want me to get one I will. If she doesn't do it, he will have to choose between me or her. (Not nessicarally to leave over, but more of who to 'play' with.)
I want to go about this safely. I mean, I don't know where they have been in the past. Shit happens. People do things and they arn't aware and the next thing you know it turns up. I want to play it safe."

"event","Today I want to kick some fucking ass. I want to take the people who run my Dom's cable business, and I want to take one of his wrenches and shove it so fucking far up their ass it will get stuck in the belly. I want to do my idea of how to make money off Smitten and use it on them. Infact, I would let Smitten_Kitten off the hook completely if I was able to do this. Here is how it goes, listening? Good...
First, we take something to sedate the poor fucking bastards. Letting the sedation kick in, and having them fighting less as hard against us(Us being me and Rouge), we would then proceede to tying up the boss. 
Drag the son of a bitch to a gay bar and make a deal with the owner of the bar to have an underground business. To be nice about it, it would include two rings infront of his on all fours position and in behind of him sticking out of the floor. These rings will be used to tie down his hands and feet. Make sure that the body is easily accessible. 
Next, you stick up a huge fucking sign that has a list of things you may do to the poor sap. Each at a diffrent price, ask me for more details and I'll get into it. 
After that, you keep him down there day in and day out. After work you have him in a small closet with a tray of food and you have him shower off after each explosive orgasm. 
I bet you more than anything he would have the asshole the size of a cokebottle when we got through with him.

Why would I want to do such a thing like this? What could have possibly pushed me over board to want to do this so utterably baddly? Well... I'll enlighten you.
1. I don't have contact with my master... I mean its pretty fuckin bad. I haven't heard a word from him since Sunday other than one small little message saying that he misses me and loves me.
2. His cell phone doesn't work and he isn't given much time to really get it fixed. The job he does requires him to be in at 6a.m. and this week, so far...he hasn't been getting off until after 1a.m. By 12a.m. I'm offline and off to bed. So yeah, this kinda bothers me.
3. I miss him, and I blame them for giving him only one day off and such shitty times to work...
So yeah, this is pretty much why I'm fuckin' pissed.
But hey, I'm a pacifist... What the hell could I do? I'm just harmless...Well next time you see a violent pacifist and say, ""Aww, your harmless"" We are the types of people who sell/give these kinds of ideas to people who WILL do it to you. As for my Dom's boss... The son of a bitch is fucking lucky I don't know him... or I would be going batshit on his ass."

"event","Well, I have been thinking for a while now. Along with working in my history text book(When I wrote this up it was 10:45a.m.). Through everything thats happened in this world, shows up in this book, my American History book. I may be wrong for what I'm about to say. But, I am going to take a stab at this un-doubtably ludacris thought of mine..:
What if most things in this world is a hoax? A huge scam in the scheme of things. We want people to look at our era as a time of great glory. Possibly greater than that of the Fall of the Berlin wall, or WWII. I know not of who is behind it all, but maybe they are controlling Bush, and other leaders. Forcing pawns, soilders, to die in false wars. Along with numerous of other things. Teaching us these wars are for the good of mankind, then seeping into our minds and telling us to join the army. Who knows? Perhaps the Wars were already plotted out... Just need the puppets to dance. The war we have now, the one towards Iraq... Doesn't seem warish. Not as brutal as WWII or Korean War or any of those other old wars... What if the soilders are just puppets of the higher ups...Dancing their sick and twisted dance that was placed out before them.
Seeing as we all are civilians(I'm assuming thats the audiance I am reaching out to), the event of this is actually being possible, seems well...unfathomable."

I'm not sure how I wound up in a supermarket, but I did... running around until I got to the DDR Dancepad... Thats where I saw my Master, I mean, he had the scent of my master. Anyways, so he tells me to play this little bomb game with him. This game consists of a bomb like structure, with little squares with words on them. When I reached for it it came out and I could hold onto it. It was a match word game. To make it a bit more of a challange, this bomb like object was in the air about 17feet. The more words I got right, the lower it got to the Earth. 
We had made a wager, he told me that if I lost, I would become his pet, his little toy. However, if I was to win I get to live and go on about my business in the world as I was earlier on before all this had happened.
I don't know why I took up his offer..., but I did. I started playing, I got down to the 10th floor and I reached for the next box, and It was too far out of my grasp, I slipped and fell... I was sure I was going to die from the fall, but he caught me. Pulling me into his van after getting me tied up. 
(Note, in all my dreams, everyone is a fur, unless I state otherwise, assume they are some form of furry)
Master isn't a furry in real life, but in this dream he was a gray wolf. Oh how I adored his scent...He leaned me over to the side of his bed, and ...well, we made love. 
An instant after finishing up I had appeared somehow back in the supermarket... Playing my DDR. Strange really..."

I got alot more opportunities open, something about being able to take this one course so that I can get 8collage credits at the beginning of collage.

Been harassed the past week by frickin people from Africa. Don't get me wrong, I love meeting people, I honestly do. But when they find out your single, from America, they want either Cybersex, or for a chance to meet you, or to be your boyfriend.

They are none the wiser. That and I've been on invisible the past week to avoid these stupid fucks. 
Been listening to Sean Kennedy lately, very funny man. I love his work. Been trying to find a way to get something nice for my boyfriend lately... Nothing turning up so far... God I feel pathetic...

"event","This is a odd dream I had...ITs a bit long but intresting none the less.
In this dream, It started out as me watching spazfox. Incidently, spaz was Jesus and he was fighting against nuns. Then it got weirder...
I had arrived at school, accompanied by my wolf(this wolf shows up in alot of my dreams)Where my wolf came from I have no idea...we walked the halls until we came across the auditorium. People were flodding the hallways anyways. Upon entering I didn't realize what happend to me. My wolf was gone and I would soon learn I had a complete sexchange. Apparently, that didn't freak me out, like the way people tend to freak out after they have a huge change.
I went to the desk where people were standing around and soon learned that it was an auction. For what, I don't know.
Apparently, they were auctioning off cosplayers, now that I think of it...My ex had been there. He was cosplaying as Dan Hibiki(puzzle fighter)But, this oddness doesn't end there...not by a longshot..
It was back, the dream...It started to turn into a reoccuring dream...(I had this dream once before, starting here.)Having seen Momiji on the stage I thought perhaps I should give the auction a shot. But, I got out bidded by my Gaian Character, Cookie_Cream_Dough. She had almost gotten outbidded by Batman. Aquaman and wonderwoman were the judges. Upon seeing this I took my leave. I walked through the schools halls that was now turned into a dealership hall. Tables lined up against the walls with anime and furry merchandise. As I walked, I found myself entering the main building. But, the main building wasn't school anymore. It was a mall/convention area. I had gotten the urge for some Ramune. So I entered this room, it was a type of movie room at a very slanted angle. Watch your step, or you could fall over and snap your neck like a twig.
I was getting thirsty, so I went to the side isle and yelled, ""Where's the Ramune?!"" A girl got up. To my surprise it was a girl I knew back in middle school, Nadia was her name. She led me back out to the mall/dealership room. It didn't change by much, only that now the dead end was at a slanted position. 
She lead me there, the dealer's table's owner was dead.  When she left I reached for a bottle of Ramune when was suddenly stopped by a commanding voice, ""Drop it and step away!""Being how I am, I stand, having grabbed the bottle. I looked to him for a moment. Popped the cap open and started to drink. Lychee, one of my favorites. I dropped it when I was finished. That's when he told me to step away, they were going to shoot down the dealers table, just as they did the shop owner. These men had (What appeared to be) Uzi's and were dressed like soilders from the marines. Their firearms pointed at me and I stood infront of the shop. A friend came to my aid, I don't remember who... One of the three soilders, the leader it appeared to be, had a diffrent type of gun. He shot off a single bullet at my friend. I saw him collapse...I knew he was dead before he hit the ground. My fur (apparently I had fur, whitish gray fur) bristled, along with my hair. I ran at them, one of them managed to shoot the store up a little, but I got to him and attacked. He was down for good. The leader, whom of which killed my friend, took the gun from the remaining soilder and pumped me well with lead. I fell, and laid there, toppled over my friend. I started to push myself up, the first few times had been useless attempts. When they were ready to leave, I managed to push myself up. I stood and ran at him, lunging. He swung around, but it was too late for him. I tore into his flesh and I killed him. The remaining soilder ran in fear...
A few moments later, a shounen dressed like the moogle woman from FF appeared. I was chewing on some gummy worms and tending to my wounds. He was handsome, very beautiful indeed... He approached and caught me offgaurd.  Nuzzling his chin into my neck, hands slipping around my waist. Whispering softly into my ear, ""Join me, and help me... If you're angry for what my men have done, blame me, I sent them."" Upon hearing this, I feel rage...My fangs are bore as I lash out trying to attack him. He was too fast, moving swiftly and gracefully. Almost as if he was floating. In one swift movement, he brought me to my knees. I had no choice but to join. He smiled and held me, leading me back over to the booth. That's where he gave me a watch, kissed me gently and was about to take me...
But then...my mother wakes me up. Here I was about to get some yaoi lovings and I get awakened. DAMNIT!"

"event","Okay, well...this weekend has just been peachy... Ooh and I mean lovely adorible I want to choke you until your eyes pop out of their sockets adorrible.
Saturday, I was supposed to be picked up by someone from my team. You know? I don't have a ride...I can't drive yet. I called them up and asked them if there was going to be practice. They said yes, and they would send someone in a bit. So, being the person I am, I smile and say okay and hang up with them. I get everything packed together for that days fighting fun! Yay! I wait...and wait...2 hours...Now, when I called it was about oneish...and by the time I figured they:
A. Didn't care enough to come pick me up 
B. Forgot
or C. Went ahead and did practice without me.
Now...all of these had the same result...They all didn't include picking me up, and they all didn't include calling me and telling me 'Hey guess what numbnuts, we are ditching you!'..So...Until it hit about 6pm..I had no idea where the fuck they were. At 6 it gets dark. We don't practice in the dark for many reasons...All I know, is that I wasn't feeling all that great by the end of the day. I mean, who would after being ditched without a word?

Sunday
Today, I was supposed to go with my Boyfriend out...I mean, gods its been 2 fucking weeks! 2 WEEKS! Alright...Now, his job has gone and pissed me off once more. But, hey...lets cope with that. I mean, its how life goes...Shit happens. So...it's 1pm I wake up,(after staying awake till 4am on saturday night to talk to Garr)and I get ready. I get a quick shower, get dressed and hop online to say hi to my boyfriend. Well...no response...okay? Maybe he isn't around, maybe he will show up without notice...You know, like a surprise arrival( I wouldn't put it past him)Well, it soon turns out just like saturday. Waiting...waiting..not a word. I get worried. I don't get angry...I get worried. I start thinking. Had Garr or Lost puppy not been here for me all day I would have gone fucking insane and depressed. When it hit about 8:30 I was like...What the fuck? Not a word, not a sign...Just not here.  So, I call his cell like, 4 diffrent times. Finally I'm saying FUCKIT ALL, and so I call his house phone. I ask for him and she gets him on. Apparently he has been sick and sleeping all day. I'm relieved. Atleast I know he loves me, and that he didn't mean to not call. Just, all these long nights of work in the cold...got to him. I want to kill his boss."

"event","Well, its almost been a week since I wrote in my live journal. So, what the hell, I figure why not start writing now. 
Almost finished reading my book, and all this week I have been talking to lost puppy and Garr
Which reminds me...I sent out to Garr two packages of Resses cups and an American Quarter. They said it should get there in the next six days. Hopefully it will get there soon. Along with the fact I just got a few more pictures done. Tonight I will be working on picture 15-16 and possibly more. 
Onto other things, I'm also working on the lyrics. Just finished Salvation and starting on Pawpets. Unfortunately, the music is loud(Not that I don't like loud or anything)and interferes with 2's voice. So, its kinda hidden to me. But, hopefully I will get it done tonight.

So, here is my agenda for tonight:
1.Get the lyrics down
2.Finish the last few chapters of my book ""Dream Catcher""
3.Get more artwork done
4.Play some StepMania

I do hope Garr enjoys his things once he gains them. Unfortunately, I was unable to afford the insurance for the package...So help me if it doesn't make it I will tear the post office a new one and then get more money so It WILL be insured next time. I don't want Garr to get me anything...or to pay me back...Though,he makes it seem like he has to...I just want to see him happy and to enjoy what I worked to get for him. 
My titles:
pet/sub = Talis
Secratary/assistant = LostPuppy
Stalker =Garr"

"event","Well, bran new day I suppose...I mean, this whole weekend I have been working on one picture in particular. In paint... Why in shitty old paint? I'll tell you why, just because I can. 
Loving Garr as much as I do, I take his advice and start tinkering with the coloring of this picture that I did of his fursona. So, Friday night...Starting at 9pm...till... Oh, about 6am(that was when my vision started fading in and out)I was playing around with the coloring. Well, it was mostly tracing. But, that wasn't the end of it...oh no. That night at about 3am I accidently closed the paint and when I re-opened it. Much to my displeasure...When zooming in, it was ungoddly horrible. Fuzzy and blurry beyond belife and saving. 
LUCKLY, my dear friend LostPuppy was there to help me out. He had already been keeping track of my tracings, helped me out by sending me a new copy of it. ALREADY TRACED! I just had to fidget here and there with a little minor details and we were set! Yay, so from then till 6am I was working away...Simply because I am that dedicated. 
I slept for about 4 hours. I got up at 10, got back online and started working once more.  All of saturday I was working. I was taking few breaks here and there. You know, to get more coffee. Also to up my hand and eye cordination with a little of stepmania here and there. So, last night I was finished by 5:30. Spent the last 30 minutes or so playing step mania and went to bed. 
I feel loved. This morning two people had called my house to give me a wake up call because I had asked on an away message. Usually, people don't do it. Well, Garr liked the picture so it is worth it. All the lack of sleep and paranoia in the world couldn't replace the happiness of knowing I made Garr happy. =^.^=


<.< Now all thats left is to plot getting the company out of the house...It's not good company unless they are MY company... >.>"

"event","Well, today Its been one hell of a rollercoaster ride.

Today, SSDD(Same Shit, Diffrent Day) for school. But, that shouldn't be surprising. As for the rest of today, when I had gotten home, it was get on the computer get off the computer. Next thing you know I'm playing messanger and apparently I'm about to get shot down for it. Ah well, gotta ignore it and keep going, you know?
I had done artwork today, for Kurt and Garr. While listening to the weekly 2sense show. Oh, how I love that show...Takes my thoughts and problems away for those ever so blissful two hours every friday. Well, after my two lovely hours, I had finally completed the picture. 
It can be seen here:

Well, much to my dismay, unfortunately...the one I love, my dear Talis. His work has been kinda hard on him as of late and it's been 6days since we have last really seen eachother. I know it may sound like whining. I'm lucky to have him. I just, dislike his work. I mean, for gods sake he is one of the best they have...And because of that, he only has sundays off. But, he used to be able to come over after work. Now they are pummling him down with mass jobs(He does cable installation and what not), and its been holding him down till past 11pm. I mean, for gods sake tonight he has to sleep out in his truck so he can actually get SOME sleep...Concidering of the jobs he has to do tomorow. I'm fed up with his bosses and I wish I could just take a screwdriver and fucking screw in the loose screws. But, I'm a pacifist...I couldn't ever pull myself to do it. But, so help me...I can think it! Can and will!

Ah well, atleast I have LostPuppy and Garr to keep me company. Along with my pet Nikarii. But, yeah...
Atleast I have the great title of being Garr's official stalker."

"event","Today I watched the president get sworn in...and this is all I could think while I watched him speak.

I find it intresting, that we live in a country of 'diversity' however, because of just one person in office, those who have a diffrent lifestyle(Homosexuality), and those with a diffrent religion(pagan, athiesm, and wicca), can be so easily tossed aside. 
Just because that one person, (George W. Bush), believes it to be immoral and wrong. But, then again...I suppose its rather hard to find a christian republican that isn't irrational, stubborn headed and unwilling to talk or accept others lifestyles and belifs...
But, in my own personal opinion. I think those of a diffrent lifestyle or religion should be allowed to live in peace, marry as they please and that people shouldnt dispise/dislike them for being diffrent. I think, to be a good christian. Then you should 1. Love your god and 2. Love your neighbor. But, seeing as where we live in this kind of day, and with that man in power...My ideals will probably never be seen...Atleast, not for a very long time. 
Today, I witnessed the president not only become a hypocrite, but lie."

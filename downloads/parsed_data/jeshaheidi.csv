"event","i want to be a writer, so i should be writing like its my job. instead i have an idea that will float into my head at 4am and be forgotten by the time i wake in the morning. i try hard to be organized. i carry around a notebook for all my brilliant moments. so far, it contains this gem ""this is young life. shit sucks. if it doesnt, count yr blessings, you privileged motherfucker."" oh, and a trite sentence or two about how i feel a genuine sense of longing when i see birds on my way to my desk job every morning. i really wish i was a goddamn bird so i would not have to do what i do for a living. i simply cannot survive with an emotionally abhorrent job. i guess that makes me weak. i know my partner would really rather i just sucked it up. its just not in me anymore. ive been sucking it up for years. i threw away almost every diary i kept as a kid. i would read them and feel embarrassed about the raw sentiment expressed and tear up the pages before throwing them away each time i moved. i have a very real and uncompromising fear of being seen as human, because i dont feel that im human like everyone else. the inside of me is the most awkward thing that ever existed. my thoughts are all twisted. i have built a persona of passability. i can be really funny, lighthearted. i am also angry and everyone knows i get even when i get mad. im a force to be reckoned with and everyone sees that hardness. im not that girl, i assure you. im not even jesha. its a name my cousin made up and i ran with it in the hopes of really attaining someone elses life. jesha has served me well. shes more likable than the weirdo from grade school. to everyone but me. i was a successful kid. as successful as kids can be i guess. top of the class, all kinds of honors. smart and precocious. more words for unlikable. i doubt every fucking move i make. every feeling i have. every thought. i have no idea how im able to carry on a somewhat normal relationship. for every month i spend being normal and keeping up the non self hating version of myself ive created, there are eons of pent up weirdness. little voices telling me how phony i am and everyone sees through it. ive come to age 30 and found that no one sees through it. i built an impenetrable wall. i threw away all evidence of who i really am. i want to be a writer. i have to strip it all away. no one is gonna buy the story i might tell of the fake life i lead. the real story is the only story i ever need to tell. i did not grow up like everyone else. drugs and divorces are the average american kids story these days. im not talking about any of that crap. im talking about the complete and utter lack of self i was taught from the minute i was born. i was a vessel. i was not to be who i wanted. i do not believe i have ever been loved for who i really am. shes not pretty. shes just not. and that brokenness is something that comes around and makes a person beautiful because they survive it and rise the victorious phoenix. i never let myself be broken so im stuck in the tar without a match. who am i? i dont know now, but i know the stuff my friends and family have no idea that i am. im an overtly sexual creature who downplays my desires because im scared of why i feel this way. im a creative thinker and i am so easily bruised by criticism that i can barely breathe sometimes when i even think about speaking my original ideas. i am a fat girl and i really dont have a problem with it. i know im supposed to be ashamed and strive for a better body. but i like to eat and i just dont hate my weight. my doctor says im healthy so fuck it. i love make up and clothes and everything girly and i resent being brought up in the absence of all of that just because no one in my family cared about any of it. i want flowers and i want love notes and i want a really pretty engagement ring to wear. i dont want to get married and i dont want babies because i just find the whole venture so fucking selfish. i never, ever take the safe road and i think its about time everyone accepted that there have to be people like me. there have to be people who stand up for what they believe in and pick the battles other people dont. i serve a purpose as this hard headed angry person too and im tired of being ashamed of that. i want to move to california because i want an adventure. and i never will because i would never leave my grandmother who is 83. so i guess im choosing not to live my life for someone else. and i have no idea how to reconcile that. the most basic problem is me wanting to erase this right now and not sure a single word. how will i ever be a writer?"

Britt Gomez is wondering why it is exactly that fat people get so angry when you make fat jokes. I know they make fun of skinny people, I've had it done to me and and it's just as rude/hurtful. It's not MY fault I'm not obsessed with food, or that my metabolism is better than yours. Just like your need for 5 slices of pizza and chocolate cake coupled with a slow metabolism ""isn't your fault."" Right?

Freddie Zampieri Its not my fault i blame my mom.

Britt Gomez Blame yourself if you're fat. Over eating, lack of exercise, and a pathetic attitude. I seriously think I might hate fat people. I'm not joking. It's fucking gross and I can handle hiding behind their self inflicted insecurities anymore. They can call me anorexic, or ask me what toddlers section I bought my clothes in, but GOD FORBID I ask them about why they are so fat.

Candace Price Agree - If you are fat just accept thats you and don't hate on the skinny's. And understand that it gets annoying that you take up 2 train seats and make loud disgusting noises when you breathe and eat.

"event","my boyfriend and i met as a direct result of an ill-advised tryst with a fair weather friend of mine. if it doesnt exactly sound fortuitous, thats because it was not. it took months of weirdness and an insistence by said fair weather friend of potential loverboys creepiness factor before i relented and accepted his hand. of course, hed withdrawn his hand by that time and i was forced to become the hunter. im a vegetarian, which says exactly how comfortable i am being the hunter. not to mention i have the on again, off again self esteem of a girl who has always been on the plus size end of the chubby spectrum. not to say my size or shape has caused me any lost love. it hasnt. but that doesnt keep me from being societally programmed to believe im less than desirable with this extra junk in the trunk. (little did i know he was totally into the junk.) hell, even if i wasnt a fuck yeah chubby girl, id still find a reason to be squeamish in love: pores too big, nose too wide, hair too curly. theres about a zillion products out there offering to cure me of all these imperfections and even as a feminist, its hard not to be indoctrinated. regardless, i found it deep in my girl guts to just call the guy. only slightly taller than me, which made him shorter than most boys, he is a pale red-head covered with dozens upon dozens of endearing freckles and a surprisingly strong build. our first meeting was the night of the aforementioned tryst, in which he paid more attention to me than the slated recipient of his hot beef injection. i was playing it cool as a cucumber, ignoring him wholly. his quirky best friend kept me busy with silly questions from strangers such as ""so, what is the meaning of life?""im quite certain i did not notice loverboys admiration as my eyes spent most of the night rolling into the back of my head. his best friend was cute, but trying too hard for my liking. also, i was determined to ignore the gaze meeting the side of my face since fair weather friendling had expressed her interest in red headed loverboy should be unimpeded by me, or anyone else, paying him any attention. i was purposefully avoidant and continued to be for the insuing melee of crap. fair weather friend, angered by loverboys inquiry about her hot friend (me), decided i should be punished for this uninvited attraction. to appease her brutality towards me, as if i could control someone elses feelings, i refused loverboys calls and emails. until one night he showed up on my porch. we sat on some rickety chairs id yanked from my grandparents house while moths beat excitedly against the dim, dirty porch lightbulb. he way shy, with his transparent blue eyes permanently gazing downward at his restless, tapping toes. i still smoke back then, and i must have gone through half a pack of camel lights in an attempt to seem less nervous. i was still living with my ex, though our relationship had long since ceased to exist, so the meeting on that porch felt verboten. two meetings later i was still refusing his kisses. im pretty sure i was making him completely insane, since he had just returned to florida after a year stint in the cloudy, depressed midwest with a less than enthusiastic to have him girl who left him feeling a cold fish about love in general. my nerves and flakiness was certainly not helping. i couldnt help being a skeptic myself, since i came out of four years of being a trophy girlfriend for someone who did nothing to earn any prize. however, i sensed id played too hard to get when i left loverboy a mixed cd and he thanked me by saying ""i needed a new coaster."" his bile only strengthened my resolve to win him back over. i called him mid-day on a friday. he was at work. i told him i had a limited afternoon window to entertain him and promised to deliver all those kisses id withheld. i had an appointment with my grandmother to meet Paula Deen at a book signing that afternoon. loverboy must have really wanted those kisses, because he told work he was sick and showed up at my house. he claimed his prize and we have been together ever since. we had such a weird, confusing beginning. i remember asking friends if a bad beginning was a terrible omen for our relationship and nearly everyone told me the same thing: get the shit out of the way, and it will get better as it goes along. its been true. we get better every day. and ill never refuse his kisses again, although they were totally worth the wait."

"event","hey hey hey! i got a job! a real job!

as of october 4th, i am no longer a dead end retail manager-in-hell. i took a job as a case worked for social security and disability claims! i get to help people instead of sell them shit they dont even need. 

i really feel like this is a step in the right direction. its a grown up job. just in time for my impending 30th! 

aaron seems to have something up his sleeve for my birthday. friday we are going to my moms because her and donna are making dinner with my grandmother. then saturday aaron is taking me out for dinner, and im thinking my friends have something planned with him, because no one has asked me to do anything for this weekend. kinda weird. so either they already have plans or theyre all jerks. im betting on the former. 

im already daydreaming about everything i can do with my new found financial security. retail does not pay for shit! i mean ive made it work thus far, but it will be so so much nicer to have some stability! maybe i can even save some money!

time to put all these exclamation points to rest. wish me luck and send me new music ideas. ive been listening to jeremy jay, vampire hands, sunset rubdown's newest, and dinosaur jr's newest."

"event","i have come to the realization that very, very few of you actually know me. and those who do actually know me are the ones who love me. so while i may complain that im misunderstood or some of you act like complete and total dickweeds towards me, i have actually, effectively made a shield around my heart so i keep the wonky at arms length. i have to remember this when i let some shit you people do bother me. the ones i love are few and spread out across this country. they have known me through good and bad and love me despite my numerous flaws. because the me thats underneath everything is so worth it. remember that, bitches. 

also, there are some people i love that just get me and i get them. its a visceral attraction to their character and i love that. it may not be the kind of friendship where we get to know everything in and out about each other, but i know they are awesome on an instinctual level. it feels good. 

alternately, if yr reading this to cause me drama or if you have ever used my name in a nasty conversation, GTFO!

"event","the past week has felt very very long. i feel somewhat different. i feel a bit transformed. i have had a lot to think about, with mina passing away. i have been thinking about my grandfather so much. ive had a lot of solace and just time in general to think. im pretty convinced that i got that horrible head cold last weekend more out of exhaustion than anything else. i hadnt dealt with any of the feelings i should have and it just hit me. like a ton of bricks. it felt so strange to go to the store tonight. it felt like i had not been to work in a very long time, even though it has only been just now a week. im sure ill feel better in the morning, but right now i just feel kind of sinking and nostalgic. i have a lot of dreams where my grandfather comes back. in one, i saw him walking into the backyard and he told me he was on a crazy tv show where he had to convince everyone he had died. and now he was back. ive said before, im no good at loss. sadness and like feelings were not really tolerated when i was a kid and i learned to just ignore them until they were gone. it also made me really afraid of them. i know ill feel better in the morning."

"event","*its cold. i hate cold. im third generation ybor city native and i need at least 70's to be comfortable. the only good thing about this cold snap is that all 3 kitties surround me on the couch to feed off my body heat and they look adorable. 
*you can go ahead and skip raisin bran extra. its not as good as raisin bran crunch. i was sucked in by the commercials, and the fact that target had it on sale for 3 for 8 bucks. so now i have 3 boxes of mediocre cereal to eat. but i do love cereal no matter what so its ok. i just wont buy it again. 
*weight loss is really slow going this time around. about 1.5 lbs per week. but thats a good steady rate, and i have less to lose so it makes sense. i just have to keep myself motivated, and add in some more exercise when its not so damn cold. 
*aaron took me to the strawberry festival this sunday. id never been and i had no idea it was quite so redneck. but i did see some amazingly cute racing pigs and that was well worth the cost of admission alone.
*i love that i can take aaron to antique and vintage stores. he never complains because he can take pictures while i shop. 
*yesterday this really creepy woman, trying her hardest to hold onto her ""youthful"" beauty came in to the store. she was walking with a sort of step thump, wearing two different shoes. we were trying to figure out if she was disabled or crazy, because neither shoe appeared to be orthopedic. they were just different. she was also super mean.
*do you guys still steal music? i have no idea where to do so anymore. fill me in. i need to get some new music, and it needs to be free because im poor. arent we all?
*still in love with my haircut. i love heather. 
*creepy dreams continue. last night i dreamt that id been kidnapped by my friend michael. he wouldnt let me go home because he wanted me to love him or something like that. eventually he had a party and hal sparks was there. i told michael that he should let me go, and that id kiss him if he did. hal sparks chimed in that if i tried to leave without kissing him, hed marry me. so i kissed him and he let me go and i ran to a thrift store and was desperately trying to find a phone to use to call aaron so i could go home. somewhere in this dream i also went on a really hardcore job interview where you talked to a panel of lawyers who tried to break you down and scrutinize yr resume. no idea what these things mean. what the hell am i thinking?
*going to get ready for work. bah. cheeto is spooning casio, with his arm across her and everything. a-dorable!"

"event","today we replace an uneducated tyrant with pockets lined in bloody oil money with an extremely educated and temperate man of the people. this is not a historic event simply because obama happens to be half black. this is a historic day because even the conservative americans who elected bush twice have realized that following him up with another conservative would be a huge mistake. purple states like the one i live in turned blue for obama and the reign of terror ended! i can not stress enough how proud i am that the american people finally turned out for this vote and made a difference. the excitement is beyond words! and frankly, i dont care if this offends anyones delicate conservative sensibilities (not that anyone on my list should be surprised to my leanings) because i have endured eight years of this country falling apart under the misguided rule of a stunted, embarrassing teenager of a man and today is the day he disappears. 

and for those out there who called obama a terrorist, a socialist, and feared his election: welcome to yr nightmare. its about time you bastards lost some sleep."

"event","i went to the lido beach in sarasota today. it was lovely. breezy but hot and the water was nearly warm enough for me to swim in without cringing. the waves hitting me made it easier too, since they got me wetter faster and i didnt have time to think about it so much. i also spent a good two hours reading hocus pocus out there. i absolutely love kurt vonnegut and i dont know why it took me so long to start reading all the rest of his books. i read breakfast of champions in college and just never got around to anymore. but recently ive read cats cradle, slaughterhouse five and now im almost done with hocus pocus. i feel like im devouring them. i read fast, but i read vonnegut exceptionally fast. so theres the beach, and the reading, and the other thing i love about sarasota: whole foods. i had a delish knish for lunch and indulged in some vegan chocolate mousse. so good. i always take the cooler so i can bring some home. so basically its been a beautiful spring. i feel unencumbered compared to last year. i feel good. i have the first tan ive had since i was 12. im 42 lbs lighter than i was last year. i miss shara. but i feel like good times are still to come. 

speaking of, i went to dan deacon and video hippos last night at new world with kristen. dan deacon was seriously hilarious. he gave a little netflix apology thing at the beginning of his set that ended with ""and that is why im offering this forgiveness. with skin touching skin. actual human skin. touching actual human skin."" basically, if you have the chance to see him touring, you should. and make sure you get into it. 

theres a new sean na na out and i cant wait to get it. hence, i added my favorite sean na na song as my profile song."

"event","i am seriously confused and scared about where to move ahead. i have spent a lot of time content, and therefore unproductive. ok, ive got owl movement. ive got some creative outlets. i read a lot. but what the fuck am i doing? i feel so up in the air, and i feel like i wanna be a little bit grounded. going to gainesville sort of inspired me to feel that there is in fact a world of possibilities. i felt it when i first went up there for college. but those possibilities quickly became getting drunk with my friends and dancing til 4am. and it was fun while it lasted. (lets dance while we still can.) but now i feel like i might need something more, and im angry that i let myself waste so much time. the people i met are amazing. its really lovely to be able to call craig and adam and still sit with them and talk like no time has passed. not feel awkward at all. thats how i always feel with kara, and its nice to extend that to other friends. dammit, shara, yr leaving has sent me into a tailspin. i rarely enjoy going out when im not with you! so maybe my first order of business will be driving myself up to tennessee for a visit. i need to see the world. i need to make enough money with owl movement that i can pay for my health insurance out of pocket, quit anthro, and travel. a lot. so there, thats my plan. lemme know if you wanna see me. ill come to you."

my horoscope today:
t's not that you have to keep anything secret; it's just that you really don't need to show all of your desires. Your heightened intensity now may scare someone away, having an effect that's very different from your intention. As you struggle with the inevitability of what's happening in your life, you might discover that you have more power than you realize. Use it thoughtfully.

quite insightful i believe.

im off again tomorrow. hopefully ill get to see ryan. although one of us is always lacking in follow through.

"event","the arcade fire in atlanta was amazing! they put on such a good show. i havent danced that much at a show, possibly ever. the venue was great too. the atlanta civic center looks like it could double as a 70's porn set, and it had beautiful acoustics. it was really exciting to be there and see them. jason took us to the local afterward, and pavement was on the jukebox, so i was pretty much in love. we also went to ikea while we were up there. patrick and i bought wela new kitchen chairs for her 80th birthday. they were not hard to put together at all. gotta love some ikea. i cant wait until the one here opens!

im still exhausted! very little sleep in the past two days. at least im closing today. lyndsay switched with me so i wouldnt have to open. i love her a little more for that.

i went to the sarasota film festival last week and saw the movie the ten. written by ken marino and david wain. two of my favorite men from the state. and starring lots more of the cast from the state and wet hot american summer. anyway, it was great. and there is an owl movement shirt in it. so go see it when it comes out in august.

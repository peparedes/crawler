the words of others can no longer help me understand the things i desperately need to know and b/c of this fact that i have discovered i will no longer seek them.  the words of one r the ones i need and seeking them is not only the problem, but it is the solution to everything.  


vague enough for ya??  well it helped me a lil and possibly the ones that might understand this a lil."

You're a pretty angry person, although you might not describe yourself that way.
But if you think about it, you probably feel annoyed, frustrated, and disappointed often.
All of the emotions above are classic signs of anger.
And if these angry feelings are controlling your life, you may need help.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howangryareyouquiz/"">How Angry Are You?</a></div>"

"event","so the past week has been so mixed up i don't even feel like re-explaining everything, but here goes the something.  

so i've been waiting for Monday, August 28, 2006, ever since Monday, March 15, 2006, and now that the day has come and gone i can truthfully say that it was one of the worst days ever.  i get on campus and b4 i can even think of enjoying the fact that school is starting i have a major nosebleed.  then after that one stops...i have another the only difference is that the second time i was coughing up blood clots (fun right??).  so i went to the ER for like the first time ever.  the short version i went to the ER just about everyday for 4 days.  it was a nightmare, but now i'm feeling better...now i can stress over other stuff.  

since i was feeling better by friday i decided to dress the part.  since i have a nice amount of new clothes i picked out a really nice outfit.  i got a lot of comments about it, but not from the ppl i expected...it was a lil weird.  so i went to dodgeball and it was packed.  i have missed it so much over the summer.  it was all i talked about on friday nights whether i was doing something or not.  even when i was at church i would say things like ""if i was at school after i leave here i could go play dodgeball.""  it amuzed ppl a lot.  it was so weird tho to have that many ppl there.  it wasn't until it got close to 3 that it started looking normal again.  we, as in my lil group, had one accident.  tammy got hit in the face and her glasses broke, but she's ok.  i didn't get back to my room until like 5am cuz we started talking to campo.  he was pretty cool and it was funny cuz he knows lynn from high school.  i finally rolled off to bed around 6 or so.  

the past couple days have been kinda weird in general tho.  i mean besides the obvious ppl have been acting different.  i mean just random stuff and listening to other ppl trying to figure the random acts out isn't helping either.  i really just wish that ppl knew how to give straight answers.  i don't understand y it's so hard for them to just say what they mean.  don't they know that most ppl can't stand that crap.  i know i for 1 am sick of stressing over some of the stupidest things in the world.  the really messed up part is the fact that if u even think of trying to figure ppl out and then label them as such they get so offended.  even tho they're offended they still refuse to help u understand..they would just rather complain that u don't understand them and then they still give u vague answers to ur questions and then run around and do stupid stuff.  i don't c a point in trying to please everyone anymore.  i give up on it in fact.  i'm gonna b me and if u can't handle that then i guess this ""friendship"" as u might call it is officially over."

"event","so this weekend was just....amazing to say the least.  my dad took me and my best friend to atlantic city.  i've been b4, but i didn't get to take anyone and she's never been to jersey so i knew we were in for a good time.  

we had a blast!!!!  my dad and i left work early friday (MY LAST DAY OF WORK :-D!!!!) and i picked up ashley and a limo came and picked us up and took us up there.  ""unfortunately"" my dad couldn't get 2 rooms in the same hotel, since everything was booked up b/c of the concert and the tournaments, so he and his girl stayed on one side of the island and me and my friend stayed on the other.  we ordered so much room service and like 3 movies and we had amazing beds.  my friend wanted to steal the beds.  

friday night we just stayed in and had room service for dinner and watched a movie.  my dad had a round one game for one of the tournaments he was playing in so he came by later.  after they left ash and i wanted to go to the gym or the pool of something, but everything (except the casino of course) closed early (it was like 12).  the outdoor pool closed at 7, the gym/spa closed as 8 and the arcade closed 10.  so we wound up just going back to our room and watching another movie.  we went to sleep around 4am.  

saturday we woke up and got dressed and then went to the arcade until my dad called.  we took a jittney (the bus of ac) to the outlets and then his girlfriend took me shopping on my dads dime.  IT WAS GREAT!!!! i bought so many outfits i can't wait to get to school to show everyone.  ash and i got a matching hoodie so we look like twins...not really, but ok lol.  after we finished shopping we went and ate and then ash and i headed for the boardwalk.  we hung out at the carnival for a while and then my dad calls me and tells me that he got 2 more tickets to the concert if we wanted to go.  so went to the mariah carey show that night.  it was pretty good and we had good seats.  we got some souvenirs and then took the jitney back to our hotel.  we watched another movie and ordered more room service and then went to sleep around 3am.  

sunday we were suppose to meet my dad for brunch at 11, but we didn't make it there until 12 and he was kinda pissed.  we ate and then he went off to play some more while me, ash and his girl hit the boardwalk.  we went to the ripley's believe it or not museum which was very entertaining.  then ash bought some shirts for her family and some taffy.  as we started to head back to the hotel since we were suppose to leave at 4 and it was getting close my dads girl slipped off and picked up a gift for me from my dad.  it was my name in blue animals and figures.  it's hard to explain, but if u've seen them b4 u know what i'm talking about.  i'm bringing it to school so erry1 can c it.  we finally left around 5.  we hit some traffic, and we made it back by 10 or so.  

it really was the perfect end to a not too exciting summer.  now i'm counting down the days until school and since i'm not working this week i know it's going to go by extremely fast and i can't wait :-D."

"event","so the past couple of days have been very stressful for me.  i've been workin my two jobs and getting little sleep and going through more drama than need b.  the night of the 3rd well into the 4th i had a break down and realized how much i really detest my dad.  it's nothing new to most, but that night i really found out how much i really can't stand how he acts sometimes...or most times rather.  it was...enlightening to say the least.  

newayz, i'm going through phase 2 of my summer plans 2morrow.  phase 1 already happened on the 24th of last month and it wasn't as bad as i (and everyone else) thought it would b, but i'm actually a little scared of going through with 2morrow.  oh well wish me the best y'all will c all of changes come august (7wks & 3das :D).  

last but not least i'm posing a questions to all who feel like answering.  is it possible to love someone but not care about them.  i mean seriously.  i've been sitting her at my desk and this song popped in my head and i just started thinkin' bout this person and i mean i really like him, but at the same time i'm over him if that makes any sense.  is that possible??  well i should get back to work and stop wondering bout things that i can't do nothin' bout.  more later and pics of my friends wedding should b up on facebook and communitywebshots soon for those that care."

"event","2day was the 1st, and with every new month it seems that something new happens.  this month, however, the ""new"" thing that happened didn't happen to me.  one of my very good friends from high school and one of my original white sisters got married.  as i was getting ready for the wedding i realized that unlike Lorelai i am not at the age where i can be ""depressed"" that my friend who is younger than me is getting married b4 me.  i am at the age, however, where i can only ask the question WHY??  i don't understand why she wanted to get married so young.  i mean she just graduated from high school and she's not even 18 yet.  i guess they must have rushed b/c he's going in the military in a few weeks and then he might get shipped to germany, but still i can't help but feel that it's a big mistake.  nonetheless, i am one of her closest friends so i'm supporting her decision and just being there for her.  i've already told her that i'm giving her a week (aka her honeymoon) and then i want to hear from here every night...or at least once a week."

"event","so it's been a while.  i don't understand it, but whenever i get back home i alwayz seem to never write.  i alwayz tell myself i'm going to, but then i never do.  so obviously i'm at home.  i was going to write about rockbridge and the amazing time i had, but i don't feel like it mayb another time.  it must be the house *shrug*.  i'm just going to start with since i've gotten back.  

so i've been back here in MD for over two weeks now.  i've been to see just about everyone i think by week no. 1.  the first week back i spent getting job apps and b4 anyone asks i don't know if i'm getting my old job back.  i won't know until sometime in June and we don't think that i will.  last week i spent hanging out mainly.  my dad left to go on a cruise with his little young thing and left me here to dog sit, which by the way sucks.  this dog hates me and never listens to me.  we do have our good times though.  

i've been spending a lot of time with my bestest bud Ashely.  we've been hanging out on every off day she has for the past 2 weeks.  she's been helping me get a job and shop and everything.  we and my cuzin went and saw X-Men III (which by the way is frickin' awesome!!!!!!!! and i can't wait to go c it again) and she spent the night.  i'm having a bit of a cash flow problem, mainly b/c of all the money i spent on ppl during the school year, but i don't regret any of it...even the stuff i bought for ""him"".  so Ashley has been paying for just about everything for me.  it kinda sucks cause i know she's doing it just b/c she can which is what i told everyone all year long, but it's different with her b/c i know her situation and i don't really like taking money from her but she's as stubborn as me and won't take no for an answer.  so we've been spending so much time together that her mom actually said that she can't hang out with me for a week.  it's actually quite funny though.  

i've been taking a break from being online if anyone has noticed or cared and it's actually a good thing.  only a few of you might actually understand what this means.  instead of having thoughts and dreams i only have dreams.  now i just gotta find a way to get rid of those too and i'll b great :-\.  i'm sure that once i start working i'll b fine.  oh yeah, i got a job at bath and body works.  i've already done 2 days of orientation which is the only really hard part.  i had to sit still for 3hrs or so in a cold storage room watching ""informative"" videos and filling out papers about them.  my next day of work i'm going to get floor and register training.  i'm actually really looking forward to working there.  it seems like something that i'd b really good at.  even though i really wanted to b a waitress instead B&B was the first place to call back.  

it's kinda weird but i really can't wait to get back to school and not for the same reason as everyone else either.  i actually can't wait until classes start even though i have a hard class and work load.  i think it's b/c last semester i barely passed and that is not me.  i think i can't wait for next semester b/c i want to regain my good name as a student.  i do miss ppl.  i mean i miss ppl a lot, but the ones i miss the most i talk to on the phone all the time...i mean my minute counts r at like 1600 and 2000...i talk to them a lot :-D.  the one(s) i don't or can't talk to i know that if i really wanted to talk to them i could or if they really wanted to talk to me they could so i'm not that worried about that.  

i think i've made this long enough that only my bordest and/or goodest friends will actually read all of it and/or comment so yeah...until i'm bored enough to write again.  peace."

"event","i'm just getting back from church and all in all it can b categorized as i had good news and i had bad news.  i wish the good news could outweigh the bad, but it can't and doesn't.  the good news is, for all of u who actually know the situation, my brother is alive and well...ok  he came to church tonight b/c he's staying wit my grandmama for the night.  for those of u who don't know i haven't heard from bro since Oct....so yeah  the bad news only a one person would know the situation and i've already told him the news so there is no point in me going into it here.  for those of u that care let's just say that the entry i made a few weeks ago about being an ""emotional wreck"" well yeah that situation has progressed for the worst and it might become more obvious when i'm just not feeling well.  so if i seem to b very moody or very defensive or, my favorite or rather the most common one, just plain mean that's y.  just a fyi."

"event","well, i'm officially back in the land of Mary...a.k.a Mary land...b.k.a. Maryland.  the drive with nick was great.  we had a lot of fun singing with all of his cds.  we also talked a lot.  i got to spend time with him and his parents at his house.  i liked it there.  i also got to drive his car...long story so if u want u can ask, but yeah.  he also agreed to let me ride back to school with him so we're gonna work that out sometime over break.  the ride from his house to my house wit my dad wasn't that bad either.  of course, he was like attached to talking to and about his new gf, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  she bought him a really nice iPod for V-Day.  this made me think of memories that i am in the process of repressing.  if i have to put up with too much of ""them"" i might try to kill someone or something.  worst come to worst i might just return to school with a lot of pent up frustration and then take it out on the first unsuspecting soul i find.  other than that i think this break will b.....stressful to say the least.  i actually have more stuff to do now than i have had to do in the past couple of weeks.  the only difference is instead of it being for a grade it's the deciding factor in whether i can work at my job this summer or not...that is if they let me.  well that's all the late night thoughts for 2night."

<br />have or haven't done. You still want to kill
<br />them. And for a simple reason only; it's fun.
<br />Seeing people in pain is like ecstasy. Maybe
<br />you have some sort of mental problems or you
<br />are this way because of previous deep scars,
<br />only you know. But now you are sadistic and
<br />maybe you only like to see a special group of
<br />people be in pain (e.g. preps). However you
<br />are not the most social person in the bunch
<br />and people think you are weird. That bothers
<br />you somewhat but atleast you can entertain
<br />yourself with daydreaming about killing them.
<br />After all, they have no idea what's coming.<br><br><b>Main weapon:</b> Explosives and torture

<br />someone you held very dear. Now you can't
<br />seem to get over the loss that marked your
<br />soul, and the only solution is to go after
<br />the one person who brought all this pain to
<br />you. Chances are you are angry inside and you
<br />bottle everything up and don't talk to anyone
<br />about it. People may want to help, but you
<br />think that they can never understand your
<br />pain and only get frustrated because of this.
<br />But it is important to see all that you have
<br />left and be thankful of that even if you have
<br />lost something great. It may not be true that
<br />Times heals all wounds, but with time and
<br />talking about your feelings, maybe the hurt

"event","the drag ball was so much fun!!  the ppl there were all so pretty!!  their outfits were to die for and their shoes were amazing!!...and the prizes.  setting up was fun.  all we mainly did was cover up the windows and glasses of the ""dressing room"" for the queens and we put crepe paper on the stage as a replacement for the lack of a skirt.  prior to the the show we (tammy, kayla and i) got to meet the mc ashley.  we talked with her for a while about tons of random things.  since we were setting up well past the time the commons closed we ordered chinese food for dinner.  

the turn out was great.  there was a lot of ppl there.  the prizes were very entertaining to watch ppl win.  when the show first started kayla said it would b funny if i won the thing she has been planning on buying me as a gag present, which was a vibrator.  the first one that was up guess who won...the girl that has never won anything up until now.  when they called the number i knew it was mine...then when i looked at my ticket i was sure that it was mine.  it was even better when i got up there and ashley was telling the audience a little bit about our conversations earlier.  he was saying how kayla and i were comparing our boobs again.  don't ask me how it came up, but i know kayla brought it up earlier and ashley felt the need to tell everyone else about it.  she said that she wished she had my boobs b/c then he would b fabulous and i told him that he was fabulous already.    it was really funny.  there is more to this story and mike if ur reading this the rest of the story involves u so ask me about it if i 4get to tell u.  

during intermission we went and looked at the remaining prizes.  there was 3 more vibrators and i said that tammy should win either the glow-in-the-dark one or the thickest one.  all of them except the glow-in-the-dark one (which was 10"") were shorter than mine (they were 7"" and mine is 7 1/2"").  then i said that kayla (since she was going to b wit her bf in a hotel again) should win either the scented bath salts or the boobie pops for tim he he he.  she wanted the fuzzy cuffs *wink, wink*.  well as the show came near the end they wound up auctioning off the glow-in-the-dark vibrator and the fuzzy cuffs.  then the other vibrator that i said tammy should win she won. it was hilarious b/c as soon as the number was called i knew it was hers so i screamed so loud and then she realized it.  she went up there and ashley definitely asked her if that was here girlfriend that was screaming and i yelled it's just me and she was like oh it's the freshman.  then at the end of the show they were just trying to get rid of the rest of the prizes so they were pretty much just throwing them out literally.  when they came to the boobie pops ashley called kalya out and said that she deserved them b/c she had wonderful boobs.  

all in all the show was just amazing.  i mean i have no words to describe the night.  i know they were recording it, but i think they ran out of tape b4 it was over so not all of it os on there.  i know that i want a copy of what they do have b/c it was just awesome.  should have some pics on webshots soon.  i haven't updated them in the longest, but they should b on facebook if i don't get them on webshots.  time for sleep...busy day 2morrow (2day whatever).  write later."

anywayz, dodgeball was a total blast!!  we played until there was only like 6 of us left then we played doctor dodgeball which if u don't know or haven't played is friggin' awesome.  we kept losing, but it was fun nonetheless.  afterwards at like 4 we made a sheetz run.  since there was only one person that had a car except...*coughwraycough* and was WILLING to drive we piled 7 ppl into one car.  it was three in the back, one up front, one on his lap and one laying over the legs of the ppl in the back.  yeah it was fun.  well i should try to get some sleep so i won't fall asleep while someone is attacking me 2morrow at kendo.  2morrow is also the drag ball so yeah there should b another entry...an entry that will def b my write up for ccls."

But can the guy in question live up to your romantic ideal?
It's tough for you to find the right match - you're more than a little picky.
Never fear... You've got a great group of friends and a 
great closet of clothes, no matter what!

the first and main one is pain.  me being the person that i am even though i completely screwed up my ankle which spread to my knee which has now somehow spread to my foot i went and played dodgeball.  i know, i know i could make it so much worse and all that blah blah blah, but it's dodgeball.  i mean think of it this way i look forward to it every week as much as i look forward to friday and the fact that they're on the same day well yeah.  so...i said all that to say that i still feel a lot of pain and sadness b/c i can't participate in kendo 2morrow.  i'm still gonna go and learn, but i can't do any foot work.  

the second (or third if u count sadness) is joy/happy.  i'm happy b/c 2day (the 18th) is one of my ""bros"" b-day.  i like wishing ppl happy birthday.  i like even more to get them stuff, but i won't c him till spring break...if then.  it's also lynn's b-day, but i already wished her happy b-day...3X technically.  

the third (or fourth) is...is...well i dunno really how to explain it.  i've been thinking a lot this week and i sorta had something planned for 2day or rather 2night (the 18th), but the more i think about it the more i dunno if i really want/need to go through with it.  at times i think ""hey i need to know and let them know"" and then other times i'm like ""hey it doesn't matter just enjoy what it is now."""

1st - i had 2 test today both of which were in the 2 classes that i've been struggling with the most econ and acc I.  i think honestly that i did ok, but me being the person that i am i expect the worst that way i won't b disappointed.  

2nd - kayla left me all alone so she could go spend the weekend with her new boyfriend...oh i'm sorry so she could go to a party at her new boyfriends house.  and since tammy has yet to go to md lynn was my only hope, but she left on time (2:30) even though they continued to play even though there was barely anyone there.  they finally stopped when campus safety came to lock up around 4.  to make a long story short and for those of u that actually know what's going on i go to spend some quality time with someone and figure out some stuff.  things r right with the world and back to normal or maybe things r slightly better :-D.  

oh and if ur wondering yes, i am just getting back to my dorm and yes i do plan on going to kendo 2morrow @ 12, which means yes i'm going to brunch at 11 and yes i must wake up at/around 10:30-10:45.

"event","well, it's been a little while since my last entry and i wish i could say not much has happened.  

1st - class r excruciating!!  i have no idea what i'm doing in econ and accounting.  i actually was thinking about not being a business major b/c of them.  things r getting better though.  i'm understanding accounting and i'm starting to understand econ.  i'll know 4 sure soon b/c i have my first test on friday so wish me luck.  

2nd - an awkward situation has set in, but yet it isn't that weird anymore.  i was trying to joke around with one of my friends and i didn't get the expected answer.  instead they said, ""We'll have to talk about that later.""  of course on the inside i'm like ""WTF!!"", but i just brush it off.  this happened thursday night.  normally i c them a lot on fridays.  i was kinda disturbed all day and i think it was mainly b/c i had had a dream during break about this exact situation and it took place friday after md so...yeah.  nothing happened and since it's after friday i really don't care anymore.  they're not saying anything and i'm not so w/e.  

3rd - on brighter news i'm going to kendo classes.  2day was technically the 2nd class, but it was my first one and it's suppose to b from 12-1, but me, tammy, lynn, and wray definitely stayed until like 3:48 practicing.  i'm looking forward to going every saturday even though it means waking up b4 12 after being up till like 4am b/c of dodgeball, which by the way we definitely didn't stop playing until like 3:15.  every time nida would say last one after that game everyone would say one more and then we would play again.  it was like a never ending cycle...that ended :-D.

(which by the way is pure bull!!)  i really don't care if he wants to date some1 that actually is closer in age to me and by brother than to him and it really doesn't bother me that he's actually closer in age to her MOTHER than to her.  the thing that really bugs me is the fact that he can ""date"" her while he is ""seeing"" (i don't know what to call it) some1 else.  he feels that as long as he doesn't call it dating it's not.  then he feels the need to tell me every little thing about this ""relationship.""  i really don't need to know and i really don't want to know.  i mean i get it...he's happy and he just feels like telling every1.  well, every1 except female #1...i mean he's only been ""seeing"" her for like 3 YEARS!!  i will never understand it, but anywayz, he calls after he gets out from the play and tries to make small talk with me.  i ask him if we r leaving 2day and he says ""oh i'm almost 100% sure that we're not leaving 2morrow.  i don't think i want to drive 2morrow and deal with the holiday weekend traffic.""  i'm like fine w/e, but then he wants to continue talking!!  he says, ""i've been spending a lot of time with some1 who shall remain nameless for right now.""  CAN U BELIEVE THIS BULL!!  i seriously just wanted to tell him to get of the frickin' phone!!  he finally gets of the phone and i start to call some ppl.  i finally get a hold of my best friend and then HE CALLS BACK and asks me one of the stupidest questions ever!!  he asked me, ""did u get the feeling that i'm not coming home 2night b/c it's already like 11 and i'm just getting 2 her place and we're prolly gonna kick it a while since she's going out of time blah blah blah...""  the thing that gets me the most is the fact that whenever he hangs out with her HE NEVER COMES HOME!!  Y WOULD THIS NIGHT B ANY DIFFERENT...ESPECIALLY IF HE'S NOT TAKING ME BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING!!!!  up until now this were pretty good between us... good that i was in no rush to get away from here and back to school.  well, all that has changed.  i can't wait until i leave here.  by this time 2morrow i should b on my way.  let's put it this way...I BETTER B ON MY WAY BACK!!!!"

"event","so it's been a while.  a few things have happened.  

1st - new years was pretty cool.  i went 2 a party with nothin' but alcoholics.  every1 there was wasted.  since i was the only sober one there i was the only one taking pics and i'm the only one that actually remembers everything and tells all the funny stories.  the house was filthy by the end of the night (i mean there was mac & cheese, candy, vodka, champagne, and tons of other stuff on the floor).  every1 spent the night (b/c they were drunk) and helped clean up the next day.  of course my dad didn't go home either so i left early came home took care of the dog and went back.  it didn't take long since every1 was helping so i got back home fairly early and i slept the rest of the day.  

2nd - i finally got to go shopping and buy some presents.  the cool thing is that even though i spent a crap load of money already i still have a lot left.  it's a good thing 2 b/c i still have a few things left 2 buy.  

3rd - i went to c some friends the other night.  i got another present but unfortunately it was something that i already have so now she's gonna return it and get me something else.  i'm getting some other presents on sat so...yeah.

4th - yesterday i took my aunt to the movies for her christmas present.  we wound up cing king kong.  it was ok.  i know every1 else is saying that u can't tell that it's really 3hrs. but i know i could.  it was funny and entertaining though.  i know that i really didn't want 2 c it though, but she did so...yeah.  i told her i wanted something and she got it for me as my christmas present.  out of the ppl i know that will read this 2 of u know what it is, but sooner or later every1 will...i just don't plan on telling every1...u'll just have 2 find out 4 urself.  the ppl who already know r the only 1s that really care so w/e."

"event","well this is a surprise...NOT!!!!  my dad finally sat down and talked to me about my new years plans and i can't say that i'm in the least bit surprised.  whenever my dad takes a long time to give a final decision about something that he (1) suggested and (2) already has all the info i can provide that mean that he's tryin' to find a ""nice"" way 2 say no.  so he said that we should plan it for another time...whether that is next new years or spring break.  the only plus side is the fact that i can go to my friends new years party and he already knows that i won't b home anytime early.  what makes this even better is the fact that his plans got canceled 2.  so now he has to find something to do.  it would b priceless if he got stuck in the house, but i doubt that'll happen.  he's 2 much of a player to spend anytime alone unless he wants to.  and normally when that happens he has me there 2 fall back on...but not this time :-D."

"event","one of the funniest things happened 2night and the story actually requires some background so here it goes:

2yrs. ago i wasn't really feeling the ""Christmas Spirit"" more so than usual.  it was after my dad was on this whole ""real tree"" kick and i told him i didn't want a tree 4 Christmas.  he decided that he was going to mix up the holidays and he turned Christmas into an ""easter egg hunt.""  he told me that my presents were hidden around the house and i had 2 find them.  i was finding them fairly easy and whenever i found a new one i would take some time to look at it and then move on.  i wound up getting a crap load of stuff.  well anywayz he had told me that there was one present that i would never find.  i pestered him and pestered him and finally he went to take a nap and he told me that he would tell/show me where it was when he woke up.  of course he didn't and i never found the mysterious ""last present.""  my aunt (who was there at the time) and sometimes my dad have held this over my head saying that there has been ""something"" out there.  

so now here it is 2yrs. later and i was talking to my dad about my new years plans of going to NY.  he was asking what we (tammy, kayla and me) would do there.  i told him prolly just hang out mayb do a lil shopping even though tammy would b the only 1 wit money...unless kayla had some b/c i was broke.  and then he says, but u have a little Christmas money don't u??  i look at him very puzzled and tell him that i only got 3 presents (c previous entry).  i go on 2 tell him that i know i will b getting some money from some other ppl, but i haven't seen them yet.  he tells me that i have another present and to follow him into the kitchen.  he starts rambling about how i have to watch him around the holidays b/c he starts hiding stuff.  then he asks me if it was last year or 2yrs. ago that he hid my presents and i tell him 2.  he starts looking in the cupboards and all around the kitchen.  he says that he put something somewhere 4 me.  we have these three glass container that are three sizes: small, medium, and large.  he opens the smallest one and inside is some money rolled up and tied with white rope and a label on it that says to shaundra.  

i literally died of laughter.  i asked him if it had been there 4 2yrs. and he said he does know (or rather he wouldn't tell me).  we started talking and i said that i was glad that i found/received this now rather than then and he said that i didn't find it so he takes it and tells me 2 close my eyes while he hides it again.  i close my eyes and he hides it.  now the funny thing is he hid it in the microwave...the microwave...who can't hear a microwave when u open it??  anywayz, when i find it he starts jumping around with excitement asking me how i found it and pretty much just being an idiot.  i was frickin' hilarious."

"event","well my christmas was kinda weird.  i stayed up on christmas eve like always.  we (my aunt, my cousin, my dad, and me) watched movies all night.  we watched the village (TiVo), hitch (i'd already seen)(TiVo), and constantine (my aunt brought over).  we finished around 4am and everyone else went to bed.  i had already told myself and others that i never go to sleep b4 6 so i stayed up and watched the phantom of the opera even though i'd already seen it.  after the movie went off i didn't really feel like goin up to my room so i just slept downstairs.  

i woke up once when my dad came down to take our dog out and again when my aunt and cousin came down to watch t.v.  we watched harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban b/c they hadn't seen it.  we had to pause it (we have direct tv and TiVo so we can pause live tv) so we could make breakfast.  

after bf my aunt ran to her car and got my present.  she got me trivial pursuit: pop-culture 2 the dvd version.  she had already told me the list of things she went through b4 she got my actual present.  she was goin to get me an ipod, but my dad got me one for my b-day and she was going to take me to c wicked, but they sold out in 7 HOURS!!  (i know some1 is slightly happy about this Tammy).  she also said that she was thinking about getting me what barbara got me, but she figured that if my dad got me an ipod 4 my b-day he was prolly goin to get me somethin 4 it 4 christmas.  then while we were watching the beginning of harry potter (b/c we had come in late when we watched it earlier) my dad gave me my present from barbara (ONE of my dad's female ""friends"").  she got me a puppy...or an i-dog rather.  i've yet to give it a real name, but for now it's puppy.  

then after every1 got ready to leave my dad figures it's time he gives out his presents.  he plays games all the time so this was no different.  (for full story ask me later).  in the end i got a digital camera.  

we went over a friend-of-the-family's mothers house.  they had wanted us to come over 4 thanksgiving, but we already had plans so we told them we'd b there 4 christmas.  it was a lot of fun.  we didn't leave until 11:40 or so.  

we were planning on watching the rest of the movies (my aunt had brought 5 over and we only watched 1) from christmas eve when we got home, but dad was too tired so i watched them wit my aunt (even though she was falling asleep every 5min).  we watched million dollar baby and alexander.  i went to sleep around 6am again.

all in all it was ok.  now i'm just counting the days till i go to ny 4 new years."

"event","tonight i went to my old school's choir concert.  it was originally suppose to b on thursday, but it got canceled and rescheduled to tonight so...yeah  

     when i first got there only one person(actually two since she told someone else) knew i was coming.  they chased me down the hall since i went running when i saw all them running after me.  

     it was so much fun...there was me and some other alumni there and we were all sitting together acting a hot mess the whole time.  we were remembering all the funny times when we where in choir.  

     close to the end of the concert as alwayz mr. pressley called us up to sing a selection with the choir.  my friend literally crawled over me just to run up there and she dragged our other friend after her...then i came running after them.  it was hilarious cause she definitely tripped going up the stairs to the stage.  

     after saying our long good-byes we made plans to hang out while we're all still here.  i also got a wonderful surprise call tonight.  hopefully it will turn out to b very promising.  so we'll c how both of them turn out."

"event","seeing as how so much has happened since my last update this one is going to b very long...so here it goes:

well first off i called my dad and asked if i was going to b able to work my usual job over break and he said no...so that means that i won't b able to spend money since i won't b making any money...that means no Christmas presents of anyone...except for one (and that's only cause i already promised them something and they're really excited about it even though they don't know what it is only what it pertains to).  

next (and this is my own fault), i had to do some work that i never turned in and pack.  i really just didn't feel like doing it so i never did (neither one).  well, instead of actually working or packing...completly...me and my friend(s) had planned to spend our last night together watching movies all night so we did more or less.  we borrowed one from (as he said once) ""a 'loving' acquaintance"" and the other six we got from the library.  

after we finish the borrowed movie we go to give it back.  since we were out we decide to stop by our other friends room.  that was an experience that probably should never and probably will never happen again.  this visit led to another solo visit by me...a visit that no one except me and him will ever know all the details about...(unless he's the one to talk).  

we get back to my room and watch more movies.  at 4 something we spit was so that we can get some kinda sleep.  i woke up at 6 so...yeah that's like 2hrs.  i got most of my work done and some packing.  i had my whole friday planned:  
6:00-8:00       finish work, pack
8:00            bf
8:30            sign time sheet/return movies
9:00            sell books
9:15-11:20ish   last min packing
11:20-11:30     say last good-byes to friend b4 his test
11:30-11:40     turn in work
11:40-12?       crash in friends room til time to leave
it would have worked if i would have followed it.  i got through the 1st 4-5 more or less, but 5 kinda ran over and i wond up running to meet my friend and almost dying.  well anywayz, i completely forgot and skipped 7 b/c i almost died while doing 6.  i tried to do 8, but he wasn't there :-(.  so i went back to my room for last last minute packing and spazing...(that's when i realized i missed 7).  

the journey to the bus station was fun...and safe.  since i had a fortress of luggage protecting me.  and guess what...surprise surprise there was problems with the bus...AGAIN!!!!  i was definitely suppose to leave at 1:30.  i got on a bus at 3:40, but then i was asked to get onto another bus that was much more crowded and more uncomfortable.  to make a long story short...it was another ride from hell, but this time there were many and many and many evil spawns that just wouldn't shut up.  

i finally got to D.C. around 1 and i got home around 1:30.  i went to sleep at 2-2:30 and woke up at 8 so i could go to my ""grandmama"" moms funeral.  i wound up going to the movies with my ""aunt.""  we saw The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  it was good.  now after recapping and writing all this down i'm gonna go to bed.  i have another story, but it will have to wait until later...i need sleep.  peace 4 now."

"event","well, i have gottin' about 5% of the amount of work i was suppose to get done this weekend done and about 10% of the work that i needed to get done for tomorrow done.  on the plus side i dyed my friends hair today.  it was a very entertaining event.  we should have taken pictures of the process but our hands were full.  we also took a shower together...neither of us was in the shower though...just her head and my hand.  GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER!!!! :)  anywayz, that's my accomplishment for the day and most likely the week.  with the way things are going i'll be lucky if i don't flunk out of college.  i'm almost positive that i won't be back next year and possible won't be back next semester.  well i'm done for now.  peace."

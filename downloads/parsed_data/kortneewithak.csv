I haven't anything interesting to say for a while.  My life consists of work, playing pool, and watching movies... woohoooo.   My Jer has been gone since Sunday and I'm so missing him.  I'm not going to be able to see him til Saturday night!!  I think thats definitely the VERY longest that we've ever gone without seeing each other.  Thank God for free nights and weekends!

My life has been rather uneventful recently.  I've been thriving off of others' drama as of late.  I need to stop doing that.  Brittany's got a bit of drama going on with the whole 'TODD' thing...   and one of her friends has me addicted to livejournal!  I'm so sorry everyautumn that I enjoy reading your story but I do.  Honestly, the day you posted that you were going to Dallas, I yelled WHAT???  HAHA.  I'm a freak.  Britt didn't know that I had been reading it - it was out of sheer boredom, and when I told her she filled me in on all the stuff I didn't know.  I feel like I've known you forever and that I've gone through all of this with you.

I'm actually not sure who still checks this or reads any of this anymore.   I suck at updating I know.  I'm not going to promise to get any better because then I would suck at updating AND suck at keeping promises.  Double whammy.

By the way, Anchorman was so freakin funny.  I mean the movie itself lacked the whole plot thing, but Will Ferrell and Steve Carell are hilarious.  Everyone should get drunk and go see it!

I'M GETTING MY WINDOWS TINTED THIS WEEKEND!!!  Having a black car with black interior royally sucks ass in mid-July.  So mi madre is getting my windows tinted for me!  YAY for mom!

In other news, I'm officially addicted to wedding magazines and it's not good.  I'm not getting married for two years, and I already have everything picked out in my head.  I so badly want to get married now, but I know that's not the greatest idea while I'm still in school.  I want to wait until I am ready for us to be completely financially independent.  I don't want to be the people that still have to ask our parents for help when we're mature enough to be married.  Plus, if I wait til I'm out of school, I can completely focus on the wedding, and not have to plan around spring and fall semesters, etc.

Well, I've got to work a double tomorrow, so I better get to sleep!

Love to all that still read this.... leave me a hello to let me know you're still out there!"

Everything is going really well lately.  I finally got a new job and it's working out okay.  It's only $6/hour - but oh well - it's a paycheck for now and a hell of a lot bigger than the one i've been making for the last month.

It's really fun because Britt works there too!  How precious are we?  The roommates that do everything together.  It works.

Speaking of roommates, I have gotten so freakin lucky.  I went from having the worst one ever to the best one ever.  It's about time.  

     (Steph - if you're reading this - I LOVE YOU!) <--- roommate before last

Anyways, tonight we went to Big Lots and bought some useless junk.  I got a Popples folder!  Can you believe it.  It was $.39!  I KNOW!  Then, me Britt and Jer went to dinner at Chicken Oil and I stuffed myself (like always).  

It was really funny because Brittany's away message while we went out to eat was ""Out with the coolest roomies ever!""..... Jeremy's our honorary roommate now!  He's over here all the freakin time.

Things with me and Jer are fantastic.  He makes me happy every second of the day and I love being with him and around him.  He makes everything better for me. 2 years, and 2 months til we're married!

Oh yeah, another funny thing...... some people from high school that will remain nameless for their sake need to GET A LIFE AND MOVE ON!!!  Seriously.... they're still like calling me on speakerphone or 3way or whatever and trying to mess with me.  IT'S GAY!!!  GET OVER IT!!!  YOU ARE JUNIORS IN COLLEGE!!!!  GROW UP!!!!

Anyways, I think it's quite humorous.  I don't even have her cell phone number in my phone anymore so even if I wanted to call her back like her voicemail said - I couldn't - GAY!

Well, I'm out for the night...  Have a good one!"

"event","Wow, so it's been ages since I've posted.  It's about time!

I got my car over a week ago and it's fan-freakin-tastic. 

My roommate royally sucks ass.  She's a spoiled brat, bitchy rich girl.  I don't think there are even words to describe her.  She's just mean and I don't like her.  We got into an argument because I asked who ate all my pizza (since she insists we don't share food b/c she's on ""atkins diet"") and she denied it.  It was a whole freakin pizza from Gumby's... makes me mad. So, I grew balls and asked her - she blew up and we haven't talked in like 9 days.  That's okay though because I'm leaving her in 18 days for a way better apartment and roomies! 

I'm so excited about my new apartment and definitely excited about living with someone that has a personality. (besides a bitchy one)  ..... ok, enough bitching about Hillary...... Britt, I am so way excited about our pink wall, and the painting and such - fun times.

I'm also really excited that I've gotten to hang out with Ashley & Aaron again recently.  I feel like I never get to spend enough time with her.  She is, after all, my ""best lady"". 

I'm also really excited about work.... haha, got ya.  My work licks big sweaty balls.  My boss is on a HUGE power trip right now - I think she stopped taking her anti-psychotic meds.  So, if anyone knows of a decent paying job for over the summer and fall - that would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, it's getting late and we're about to watch Gothika...
Hope everyone is doing great!  

EVERYONE SMILE FOR ME!!!

Britt...... 18 days......"

You have no idea how incredibly excited I am to not own a piece of crap car for once in my life.  I think the newest car I have had was a 96 Passport and that was only for a month until my ""friend"" wrecked it..... (don't get me started on that one)!

"event","So, it was really sad when today I went to the shop and got all my personal belongings out of my car so they could tow if off to the salvage yard! :( 

My dad's not coming over to Texas for another two weeks or so and until then, I am a slave to whoever can give me a ride to work and stuff.  I hate not having a car!  What the hell did I do for 15 years?? 

On a lighter note, my Jer is so good to me.  Tonight he picked me up from work at 10:30 as opposed to 9:30.  I was super stressed out and he opened my door for me when we got to his car.  That one little thing just made my shitty day like 300 times better.  It's definitely the little things that make my world go round.  That's why I'm marrying him - he's the best!

Anyway, I'm going to watch a little Friends on DVD, then get some much needed sleep.  Let me know you guys if there are any affordable, reliable, dependable, etc. cars that you know of.  I would prefer a civic, and prefer and 2 door, and prefer a standard so keep an eye out for me!"

Like, okay, I'm turning into Jer's apartment tonight after my lab and my car made a lot of popping noises when I turned the wheel and then it didn't want to work anymore.

Oh, and the best part, is that I had to call my really overprotective, super-conservative, churchy dad and tell him I need help to get my car fixed and then explain to him why I was going over to Jeremy's apartment late at night anyway.

Oh well - I have a great fiance and a great friends and great dad and mom that I wouldn't be able to go through all of this without!  I love you guys!  Thank you for everything.

Well, it's late and I have class tomorrow, so good night!

My job royally sucks ass but it's a paycheck.  I only get one day off a week and thats only because I hacve a lab on that night!!  But, once again, it's a paycheck.  I can't wait to get this POS car either fixed or traded in.  I wish I could put my car on that show on MTV, so they would fix it for me.  I can dream....

Anyway, I have to be at work at 9:30 tomorrow morning (after closing tonight by the way) so I need to get some sleep.

Love y'all!

Anyway, tonight I watched Runaway Jury.... really good movie.  Jeremy left today for three days to Houston and I miss him already!  Monday was 7 months of dating...even though it seems like 7 years.  I feel like he's the only guy I've ever been with.  All the bad stuff has just faded away. Tuesday will be one month of being engaged... one down, 29 more to go til we get married!!!  

Well, nothing too interesting to say tonight, just really awake and bored!

"event","Ok hello. I don't know why I keep writting in here. I don't think any1 reads it. 'Cause no1 cares about me. Ha, that's the main reason why I'm always sad. But anyways I just write it for my self. And besides if I die someday then some1 might find this, which i guess would be cool.

Anyways my life sucks... like always blah blah blah nothing new. Im tired of everything, ok that's nothing new either. I guess i have nothing to write.

I have to catch up on school, 'cause i think my grades r lowering. So i need to get an A in tomorrow's math test. I remember when i used to be so happy, and because i was so happy i always used to get A's in school, and i was motivated, and everything was really easy.

But now i just have no reason to live or do anything. And the only reason im still trying to get A's is because i hate my ""friends"" and they think they r  better than me, and they ALWAYS underestimate me, so i just want to know they r wrong. 'CAUSE THEY SUCK. they really do suck. I'm tired and pissed at them.

whatever... im so sad

i need some essence in my life."

"event","I can't believe people is such a dissapoinment. I can't believe people can be so inhumane. I can't believe people have such a small heart and such light feelings.

I can't believe I've made a fool out of my own self by trusting people. Ok yes probably I'm a fool, I just never thought people would do that to me. Especially someone that I care about so dearly.

I can't believe I felt in love with such a fake person. A person that I would have done anything for, who in return talks bad about me behind my back and spreads all the secrets I told in confidence. And I thought it was my friend. It hurts... but I'm used to it.

And then there's everyone else. Almost everyone is just a disspointment.

I've given life and people so many chances. I think im running out of them. Hope is fading as well as everything else. 

Right now I guess I'm trying to look for something... and I'm lost."

I've been very sad, but now im just weird.

There r SOME little things that make me happy. So that's good. My dog is sick, i really hope she gets better. I think she's the only that loves me.

Anyways, im gonna go. like i said... i just feel weird."

"event","Ok. i feel a little better now. sometimes i think im just such a stupid pathetic teenager...

whatever.

Ok so My Day:

It was pretty normal, just like always. I learned some new italian words, and then i learned some new french vocabulary, and then in computer class i got bored like always so i was doing my math homework like always. Lunch was ok. just whatever. and then math was very stressful. I had a test which i thought was kinda hard and i couldn't even finish it. But at least there was just like 2 questions i couldn't finish. I hope the rest of the test i did it right though.

But then ""him"" i saw him and he was kinda avoiding me, well at least i thought so. maybe im just stupid whatever. and then after the test i saw him again like right in front of my face and i was gonna say hi but he wasn't even looking at me. That hurt. I almost had to swallow the ""hi"" that i was going to say. So i guess maybe he's pissed at me. I wouldn't blame him. But because of that i've been feeling like shit the rest of the day. I feel a little bit better now though. 

There's always hope. And tomorrow is a new day."

"event","I blew it. I guess it's over. Something that was so important for me. Now things just won't probably be the same at all. :(

It's over. I'm losing the fight.

And I wonder why? Why does my life has to be like this? What did I do wrong? How could some1 possibly deserve this?

Why when I think things can't get any worse... they actually do???

I've tried so hard all my life. Tried to have hope when it was almost gone. Tried to stand up when I had fallen so low. Always kept going. Only to get hurt one more time. Only to know how can things be even worse. I wonder if this was the last time I fell. The last time I got hurt. Or if im just waiting for all of this to get worse yet again.

I guess the fight it's over now. And I lost it all.

God please help me.

I blew it.

God please help me.

At least take me out of this world.

Existence, for certain people, is just the worst of punishments. The difference between heaven and hell is what you make of it, and the difference between the existent and the non exitent."

"event","Hey!! What's up everybody! Today is the day. My first entry in my first Live Journal. I just hope that determanination will prevail over laziness and that I will keep updating it.

So nothing very important has happened these past few days. I've been doing community service the entire week at my friend's church. Waking up every single morning at 7 AM!!!!!!! That's the bad part. The rest is actually KIND OF fun. I like being a junior counselor and being with the little kids. Exept when it's time to dance and sing the songs... hehe, omg i feel... well... RETARDED. Tomorrow is the last day of camp, and they have a sort of ceremony in the evening. I guess i have to go. 

I'm very tired, but I'll be glad when i get signed for about 30 service hours :-D. Yeah... of course im not doing this for free.

Besides in the morning, i didn't do anything today. Pretty much i spent my time talking online to some1 very cool ;-). 

I really don't have much too write. So see ya until a next entry. Hopefully it will be no farther than the next 2 decades."

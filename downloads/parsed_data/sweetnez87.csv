Have been searching all day for a paper I have lost! and I still don't know where it can be!? 

I know that I put it on a table, but it's not there anymore, so where is it? I really need it for a school work... 

Anyway, couldn't watch Desperate Housewives yesterday, since the file I had downloaded wansn't at all DH it was Smallville, so I had to watch CSI instead. Though I could watch it today :) 

Soon Lost in about 20 minutes, have to watch that and then I guess CSI again *haha* CSI everyday :D


Edit: Yay.. I found the paper!! Now I'm happy again :D :)"

"event","my usualy life!! You thought it should be Paradize, didn't you?

Yeah, well.. I'm not in paradize yet, not even sure I will get there!

So, another school day and my friend was sick today again, so it's a good thing I still have another friend to be with in school. 

Tonight it's Desperate Housewives again *woho* cain't wait for that, sounds like a really great episode that's on. Then I might watch HP 4 again or CSI, it will probably be CSI!

Working on another video of Fred and George and one with Syd and Vaughn from Alias, I hope both of them will be finished soon!!

Guess that's all from me today!!

Might write more tomorrow (free day from school :)) 

If I'm not then have a great time til next time!!"

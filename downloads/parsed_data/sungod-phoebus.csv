He stretched, then brushed over Phoebus's head with one head, a little habit, something he did when he wasn't even really awake. It was only then that he noticed and remembered Sophie from yesterday. Seeing her frightened expression, he sat up very slowly to not scare her with any quick movements. ""Good morning, Sophie,"" he whispered.</i>

Sophie's eyes darted from Clopin to the big blond man.  The one who was looking at her now obviously wasn't scared of the other one.  No, he was treating him like some of the daddies she had seen in the square towards mommies.  Still, she remained very tense and looked ready to spring up off the bed.  Phoebus shifted a little towards Clopin's hand in his sleep."

Clopin had to strain a lot to not thrust up into Phoebus' mouth, his hands, still clawing to the blanket, already shaking, and he desperately parted his legs a little more. The only word he got out by now was 'Phoebus', hidden between small noises of arousal.</i>

//I'm the only one who gets to see him like this,// Phoebus thought smugly, adding a second finger, scissoring them and twisting upwards.  The sounds Clopin was making went straight to his groin, even though he came just minutes before.  //God, he's beautiful.//  Phoebus released his lover's erection with a wet sound, licking a trail to the tip.  ""Tell me what you want,"" he demanded in a husky voice."

It was also partly right, but he didn't have his little secrets? Clopin was just better in keeping them. Anyway, it gave him the chance to escape and he did so, running right out of the tent.</i>

""Hey!""  Phoebus snapped out of his funk long enough to try and grab Clopin again, but the gypsy was much too fast and slipped through his fingers.  He stared after Clopin until the man was out of sight, then sank to the floor of the tent.  It felt like he had been stabbed in the chest.  ""Why are you running away, Clopin?"" he whispered.

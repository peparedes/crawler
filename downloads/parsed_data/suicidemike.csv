"event","Since I know I'm not going to get any work done at all tomorrow, I'm completing the last of my WPTZ posts here tonight.  Friday will be basically spent usurping the station's funds for my own nourishment and frantically switching between job search sites and games of Diablo II.  

As I was driven into the parking lot of the station today I noticed the electric company already there with a cherrypicker trying to fix a transformer that was spitting showers of flaming sparks.  Sure enough, I was not at work for five minutes before all power was shut off.  Susan, Nick, Corey and I all busied ourselves sitting in the break room and plotting various forms of intern abuse for my final day tomorrow.  In the end, Paul Sands, the General Manager himself, will rent a wild boar and have me coated in steak sauce, then sent streaking bare assed naked across the set during the six o'clock news broadcast.  A few moments later, Hootee, one of the guys in our department that works on live motion graphics, ran through the halls screaming ""ANARCHY!!"".  He desperately wants a copy of Adobe AfterEffects, though, and is extremely jealous that those dipholes at ABC are getting it first.

I was also delighted to notice that I was mentioned in the Press-Republican's Out & About section, in an article that praised the PSU's hugely successful Senior Exhibition.  *clears throat*
The PR's art critic, Robin Caudell writes:

""Brooklynite Michael Gallagher graphically and powerfully articulates his horriffic struggle, until a few years ago, with verbal disfluency in 'The Blessed Silent.'  He creatively scanned his face in sequential images, illustrating how difficult the release of words was for him.  In the work, he states: 'There are days when words fail me.  Sometimes my very breath fails me.'""

This hasn't done much to assague my fears of being unemployed and unhappy with myself after the summer.  But at least I know my three months at the Press are now secure.  Graduate : week vacation : work.  Then, *shrugs*.

God, give me a job.  Please.

To all of my co-workers, you were the coolest bunch of crazy sons of bitches I ever work for without getting any money.  To Susan, Corey, Hootee, and of course, my overseer, Nick.  It was a trip.  \m/

"event","Well, obviously I haven't been on nearly as much as I have been in previous posts.  This is largely due to the fact that The Senior Exhibition is finally coming to a head, and I've barely been able to get my work handed in by the skin of my frigging teeth.  I'd like to take a moment to thank the following individuals:

First and ever foremost, My fiance Kyla.  After eight months of struggling with a way to faithfully express life as a stutterer, you have taken my hands and lead me from the fog, leading me to rest upon the cool dew-strewn hills of inspiration.  I love you.

Lorraine at the Museum office, for being totally cool about everything and finding me some truly rock-ass frames at the last minute.  If you ever need anything that will not risk comprimising my own moral fabric, please don't hesistate to tell me.

David Driver, for somehow getting every one of the peices handed in on exhibit, one way or another.  The man does the impossible.

My mentor, Norman Taber.  Hell of a guy.  I'm getting you a copy of Word <I>with</I> a spellchecker, my man.

On the other hand, The following assholes can hereby drop the fuck dead:

The Painters and Sculptors.  I beleive we, as a graduating class decided that due to the volume of people trying to exhibit this year that entries would be limited to five works done in the last year.  

So here come all the over-sensitive artfags entering 12 or 16 peices per person.  Regardless of what you may have heard, you are NOT worth that kind of attention, period.  You make my flesh crawl, you goddamn hacks.  

That's about it.  Thing's here at WPTZ have slowed to a crawl, but its just the calm before the storm that is Sweeps Week.  It's a bit depressing knowing that I'm only going to be here a couple more weeks.  Then off to life outside of a university, and to a summer toiling away at local newspaper, praying to God almighty that it <I>doesn't</I> turn into anything permanent.  If I'm to get a job in a real design firm, I've gotta get a driver's liscence so I can haul me ass across the Lake to VT.  #1 on the to do list after ""graduate"".  

Until next week.  Go Mets

"event","Yesterday proved to be rather interesting.  
After I got over the crushing realization that God himself was at work to prevent me from having my portfolio viewed by Patti Belle Hastings, I went to work at WPTZ oblivious to the fact that it was indeed April Fool's Day.

After my fellow coworkers in ""the cave"" (the cubbyhole we all work in-- Corey, Hootee, Nick and myself) left for a meeting, I found myself alone, puttering along until Susan (Creative Services head) came back, announcing that Nick had suddenly become violently ill and had left.  She asked me if I ""had the brass"" to go about making graphics for the Evening News broadcast by myself.

I broke into a cold sweat, wet myself and promptly agreed in a voice I'd not heard come from my body since I was 14.  She then said she had to show me a few things first, and lead me into the board room, where there was a perfectly healthy Nick, Hootee and Corey.  

It was then announced that I'd been ""Hazed in"".  And there was much rejoicing.

For the rest of the day, various networks, undergoing upgrades, were thrown into upheaval, which included our graphics server.  We couldn't access things from other stations, leaving us to make our news graphics from Google scraps and whatever wasn't deleted during the mass Purgings performed by the IT monkeys.

Not that much of it really mattered, since when the 5 and 6 o'clock we soon found out that the Control Room software kept defaulting to generic graphics anyway.  And there was no rejoicing.  

It finally got so bad that after the 6, the graphics server was shut down, along with whatever else was acting up.  I got to leave early, but wound up unable to meet Madame Hastings back at the college.  

The graphics server still isn't acting totallly properly, and when it does we're going to have a massive bottleneck of graphic requests, but at least I won't be working on the Horse Show poster anymore.  I've more or less washed my hands of it.  

More next week.  Stay tuned!

"event","So last week was spring break, which I spent in the campus' dark Graphic Design Lab, updating all of our Molasses-fast G4's to OS 9.2.2.  At least it's paid. :)  

I return to WPTZ this week, being heartily greeted by Koury, one of the brood in Creative Services aka the ""Creative Cave"", by him putting me into a full-Nelson and dry humping me.  It was later explained to me that this was some Rite of Initiation, akin to someone being ""jumped into"" a gang.  I was flooded by an emotional mixture of both shame and pride.

Newswise, not a whole lot happened today, which meant nothing spectacular from the Art department.  Actually make that less than nothing.  Our graphics server, which allows us access to the (better) graphics from other TV stations that Hearst-Argyle owns, was down, and we could only make graphics for the news with our own limited library of a mere 1342 sucky images.  So the news sucked.  The weather sucked.  And to top it all off, I was ""Father Nelsoned"" twice.  Thanks a lot, Koury.

More news Thursday."

Anyway, I missed Work on Tuesday because I'd finally caught Kyla's cold that had kept us holed up in the apartment all weekend.  A feedbag of antibiotics later, the two of us are good as almost new :)  

The past two days here have been pretty slow.  I've been taken off news graphics for the time being to work on our full-page ad advertising our support for the Lake Placid Horse Show (Zzzzzzz) and a bunch of shit for our editorials, as if anyone gives a damn.  Today was also the quarterly WPTZ Pot Luck.  I figured since I designed the sign-up flyer, it exempted me from actually having to bring food, but since I'm a practicing Christian, I stole a box of hot chocolate packets from the break room and added it to the buffet table anyway :).

I then piled a plate with chicken wings, chocolate cake and blondies, inhaled it, purged, refilled the plate, and clocked the rest of my shift at my desk with no pants on.  More next week, but I have a feeling whoever's reading this is done with my LJ account.

I know nobody's gonna actually ask for this, but it'd be my ass if, just by chance, someone actually wanted to know what I did for 18 hours of my week . . . and all I had were fond memories of sleeping with my eyes open.

The past three weeks of this internship have been pretty nice.  I mean, I get to make graphics for the News.  From full-screen to OTS (the small ones that appear next to the anchors' head), I've covered the stories that move the Champlain Valley, and its viewership.  

Most interesting so far have been several Victims/ Missing Persons, A local town beseiged by bloodthirsty beavers, and the whole media circus that has been Gay Marriage.  I've been making a lot of graphics for the latter lately.  

The average day goes something like this:  I have a brief meeting with my immediate supervisor, Nick, who's older than me but looks as though he'd have to be carded when he bar-hops.  I sit behind one really nice guy and one sociopath who enjoys beating our mailbag with a steel pipe.  Nick leaves me at his sweet-ass workstation, while he ducks out of work and goes to McDonalds.  I assume.  

I get to work making stuff for the 5 & 6 o'clock news, which takes about three hours total between the time I get there and the time we air.  Meanwhile, anywhere between eight and ten people come back and forth, look at me, and say ""You're not Nick!""  much in the same manner that someone might say ""You're not clothed!""  Sorry folks, I'm not Nick.  NICK IS IN THE GODDAMN CONTROL ROOM!

Because I've been getting all kinds of responses.  An open road.  A bird.  A closed esophagus.  I find it as a decent visual analogy of stuttering.  I thought of the closed esophagus.  
It's the basis for a cover design on the Senior Exhibition catalogue, one of four that were handed in for a final voting by the rest of the Art Seniors this wednesday.  Before we convened our ideas on the twenty something people who had spent the last few years in other creative disciplines, My colleagues (Ryan, JP, Sean) and I had agreed to making sure that we forced everyone else's hand; When that many people who don't know what we do . . .well, nothing gets done.  Try as we might to guide the others who will ultimately decide the fate of this publication, now two months have gone by, and with a month to get this thing to the printer, nothing decided.

Wednesday, Final mounted peices were passed around, and the usual passive-agressive cirticism was offered.  I can honestly say that about two-thirds of everyone's efforts was pretty impressive; So much so that foolish optimism crept into my mind and I thought that the talented but unknowing youths around me would actually decide on which of our visions would represent the body of work of the entire senior artistic student body.  Then . . . Ryan, our default leader, whose generally a really good guy, and pretty damned talented to boot, had to pipe up and let everyone know that ""we're still open to suggestions"" . . .

I know its probably seemed like  a long time since I've updated, and it has been, but I've honestly tried before, and well . . . shit just kept happening.

I brave this tonight because the need to express myself to an audience of none is rather profound.  Much has happened since my last post, which was abruptly cut short by unpredictable bowel movement of which I will spare you further details of.  

Engaged life is treating me well, and so far school is going along at a relaxed pace, even though the subject matter is still rather boring;  this is all the more harder to beleive when it is shared that I am taking classes in Human Evolution and, swear to God, Science Fiction for my English requirement.  All I can say is, I'm about 50 pages into War of the Worlds, the aliens are on a rampage in the UK, yet H.G. Wells' startched verbage that was the tongue of 19th century England is totally killing the whole thing.  

Work at WPTZ, the local NBC affiliate I'm interning for, is very good, in fact the only thing that would make it any better would be if it were paid. . . but for now I'm rubbing elbows with local News celebrities (most of which, if I may say, are really cute) and making graphics for the evening News, including the recent kidnapping, labor disputes in Vermont, and the ever-hilarious Democratic Poll screens.  Life is, in a word, good.  

And my beloved little pet <A HREF=""http://www.dicechucker.20megsfree.com"">dicechucker</A> is gradually receiving a more grown-up design approach, which is at present only noticeable on the homepage.  New header, image links, and more content.  :)  I'm a happy little camper.  

Going to see <I>Miracle</I> tomorrow.  Monday I turn 25.

I am happily tapping this entry into my blog, dormant of late for my browser troubles, as my keyboard would spontaneously lock up and go into CAPS LOCK mode whenever it felt like it.  

Thanks to some sound advice from my good friend Dugan, who I beleive is still serving the country in Iraq, I got myself a copy of Lavasoft's ""Ad-aware"", and have so far not seen a virtual hiccup.  To him I am eternally greatful.  

Well, things have been shaking.  Last I left off Kyla and I were engaged.  That's right, <I>engaged</I>.  I'm still quite happy about it, and my final semester at school (started this week) is going fantastically.  I'm taking two classes, one of which is Science Fiction (YES!), and three days a week I'm interning (for free) at WPTZ, our local affiliate for NBC . . . MAKING GRAPHICS FOR THE NEWS!!!

Already splashed across our viewing area have been full-screen graphics on stories about Ear Infections, the Democratic Primary, and OTS (over-the-shoulder, those boxes that appeare next to the anchor's head) about Martha Stewart's trial!  It's Quick and Dirty Photoshop like I've always dreamed about.  The people are cool, the hours are great, many of the anchors are total hotties, and I get to sit around watching TV and drinking free coffee and soda when it gets slow.  Healthy it ain't, but I'm a happier man for it.

Even better is the recent prospect of becoming a Mac tech for my school's Graphic Design Lab.  It's a paid position, meaning I can finally fucking QUIT my dishwasher/prep cook/workhorse position at Northern New York's Worst Chinese Buffet, Wong Kwon (translated, ""The Crown"").

Whew.  More later, it feels so good to post again!!  Sarah!  I miss the hell outta you!  see you soon girl.  

I'm off to go save the thankless citezens of Baldur's Gate in <I>Dark Alliance II</I>, my thoughts of which are reflected <A HREF=""http://www.dicechucker.20megsfree.com"">here</A>.  I feel so alive.  Like WOAH."

<B>December 22, 2003:</B>  Kyla comes home, walks into the living room to see a pathway of lit candles strewn with rosepetals, ending in a heart-shape made of more candles.  Within is a boquet of flowers and a white ringbox.
I, waiting in the wings, come out and propose to her.  She said yes. :)

So I'm now officially ""Off the market"" as it were, and a happily engaged man who is now fully entitled to a future bachelor party. *ROCK*  

The actual marriage isn't going to happen for a few years while we both get real jobs and start making some money, which I'm pretty happy about.  What's really funny is I'd dreaded this commitment for the longest time;  I thought it would mean the end of my youth, freedom and general happiness.  But to tell you the truth, I've never been happier.  I look forward to it, I smile when I think about our kids, and how happy I'm going to be as a husband / father.

Not only that, but I went to Wal-Mart the other day and they had this HUGE bin of cheap PS2 games for like $20.

Let me say this:  EA games is a bunch o' dumbasses.

I can't beleive what some asshole who's let his life amount to nothing more than annoying people's lives by promoting some porn site or stupid giveaway / dangerous weight loss / blah blah blah.  

I booted my computer up the other day and a program ran at start up calle ""Power Scan"".  At first I assumed it was something for our scanner except I know I hadn't downloaded it and when I next saw the title screen, I realized it scaned for porn on your PC as a means of ""protecting yourself"".  

Damned if I knew where it came from.  

So I scoured my hard drive and found about seven folders of ""what the fuck is this shit?!"" and deleted everything I could, except that two of them wouldn't let me delete, saying that it was being shared by another program, despite the fact that all I was running was windows.  
Sucks to be me, I guess.

Only now these files I couldn't delete (for stupid shit like ClockSync and something else I have no idea what its for) keep trying to access the internet and I'm forced to let it because its making my firewall go nuts.  

If any of you know what I can do, for god's sake tell me.  

I remember fondly of years when the internet was not so paranoid, when software like ""evidence eliminator"" didn't exist, and these cruel marketing bugs didn't slip uninvited onto your computer.  And I have your boss to blame.  In these days of monitored email and websurfing, and other various forms of invasion of privacy at the workplace, instead of just letting the drone worker fuck around a little to make his drab cubicle life a bit less crushingly mendane, you hae to break what's left of their spirit and do this shit.

First, <A HREF=""http://www.dicechucker.20megsfree.com/me_badass.jpg"">look at this</A> and then take a guess.  Then start reading the post again.  I'll wait, it's fine.

Hey, glad you're back.  Before I tell you what/who I was supposed to be (the <I>emotionless, code-generated killing machine part</I> was a big hint), I've already heard FBI, Man In Black and Blues Brother, for christ's sake.  Only one person all day got that I'm supposed to be Agent Smith, from the Matrix.  No such luck.  I know if I'd been carrying a gun, thing's would have been different, but I figured the faculty would frown on that sort of thing.  Ah well.

I also finally got my pint glass, which sports the fabulous <A HREF=""http://clubs.plattsburgh.edu/sa/"">Student Association</A> logo I designed for the college.  Since it's official admission, they've been plastering it on mousepads, coffee cups, shirts, stickers and the like, and have been good enough to provide me with such trinkets to photograph and add into my portfolio.

When I heard they were making pint glasses, I made it well known that I was interested in having one for my own.

So today I go into the SA office, and surprise, surprise, the president (who doles the shit out) isn't there again.  I sheepishly ask for anyone who can to provide me with a pint glass and I'd be on my way, and sure enough Tushar (the same dickhead who actually voted <I>against</I> the committee paying me an extra $25 to do the logo) starts rambling on about having to go to the promotions committee, etc., etc. . .when the VP for services goes ""For christ's sake, he designed the logo, give him a pint glass!""

I had my shiny new pint glass in ten seconds flat.  
Fuck you, Tushar.  dick.  

So I'm doing pretty well.  After Stats class tonight I venture off to help out at the Graphic Design Lab!  I feel so useful today!!

Monday it rained all day.  I awoke to darkness and cold rain, and I went home to the same after my classes were over.  Throughout the day I had a six hour break in between classes, and I found myself feeling listless and unable to concentrate on any one thing.  I went out, got a coffee and a apple pie and just walked around in the rain for two hours.  

It was just what I needed.  It was beautiful.

Today was less a day of self-enrichment/realization/insert new age term here.  I made a new logo!  

I need some feedback on this, everyone (read: SARAH and DUGAN).  What say ye, yea or nay?

"event","WOah.  Long time no update.  

I'm still alive.  Just been kinda busy lately.  and unsurprisingly, I suppose, depressed for no reason.  Here's the run down:

Friday:  Got two top wisdom teeth pulled.  One word:  <I>rancid</I>.

Today:  Went to Massachusetts today with a buncha people from school.  Did three museums in about seven hours.  The Clarke is a must-see;  the Museum of Contemporary Art is a dissappointment;  I don't know, maybe I just don't understand postmodernism.  Anyhoo, to and from, watched <I>Chocolat</I> and <I>Frida</I> on the bus.  For those of you who may not know, Frida Kahlo was a brilliant painter whose fame peaked during the 30s and 40s.  She is known for such works as her masterpeice <I>The two Fridas</I>, the slightly lesser known <I>La Columna Roto</I>, and a prominent Unibrow.  Her life is (according to the movie) filled with personal tragedy, death, betrayal, and bold exploration into a love that was unspoken of for the time (read: lesbianism / bisexuality).  

But there was a great line in the movie, spoken by her husband:  

""If you paint, you do it because you can't live without painting.  You paint until you die.""
I thought it could be applied to all arts, and hope it will inspire me to start working on some new ""artistic"" peices.  
Later, a bunch of us left to eat and wound up at a bar where pitchers were split and arts were spoken of.  

For the first time in a while, I feel alive.

Last thing:  New feature.  Font of the week (and I define ""week"" as ""whenever I get around to it"".)  This week's font is . . .

"event","Well, this weekend Kyla and I took up my sister's invitation to Warrensburg, NY-- The veritable asshole of the state, to a plot of land so in the middle of nowhere it gives you the creeps because you know this is just the sort of isolated place some twisted Leatherface wannabe is hanging out in.

On said property lives my sister, and about 60 or 70 other assorted members of my extended family, all of whom have left Bensonhurst, Brooklyn for the opportunity to join the glamorous ranks of the Rural Poor.  

and I don't just mean ""poor"" like ""caught a rough break in life and tries to get by"".  I'm talking ""poor"" like ""every horrible stereotype ever made about rednecks, inbreds and thugs rolled into one and then given a steady diet of lead paint chips and strapped to a chair in front of a microwave for a few hours a day"".  These people embody it all (mostly my younger cousins though).

As if things at my sister's place aren't bad enough, in her trailor (no shit) that looks as though it could completely collapse in a stiff breeze, is riddled and is riddled with the filth of SEVEN cats, two large dogs (who aren't allowed outside 'because they chase the cats') and the distinct film of nicotine that builds up from years of constant cigarette smoking around her three beautiful children.  C'mon, Fran.  You fucking know better!

Its the dark, shady area of my family I'd been dreading that Kyla should ever see.  For years it didn't happen, but I guess I couldn't put it off forever.  Every relative I've ever been ashamed to admit I knew was there for one of the kid's birthday parties. . . 

This little girl's parents don't have two nickels to rub together but that won't stop them from blowing $1200 to rent an inflatable playhouse.  I mean what the fuck is it with these people?  does the clean Adirondack air cause their common sense to drain from their systems?  Is it the government cheese?  As I pretty much stood around and waited for the hours to go by, Kyla bore witness to screaming, drunken, pot-smoking / dealing, car-stealing rabble of White Trash that was part of the Gallagher clan.  

I wanted to fucking die.

My parents raised us differently, and I couldn't harp on this more.  We were taught respect.  Courtesy.  Tact.  Dad could never tell us enough that we were different, and never hesitated to point out the reasons why this was so.  The fact that we were actually educated was a big one.  I swear to God I garauntee you half these fucktards can't read or write.  

And then my sister's fiancee proves how funny he is by cracking racist and homophobic jokes around my biracial girfriend.  (""Whaddaya call a bucktoothed Ethiopian?  A rake!"")  You're a fucking RIOT, you asshole.  And they're both nurses, if that's not just a riot.  If I was admitted to their hospital with them on shift I'd be signing my own DNR form.

You can't pick your family.  You can just distance yourself as much as possible.  

So one sister's too far gone to save her.  My brother is being worked to death.  I still have Maria.  All of them still smoke.  I guess two dead parents and having kids doesn't teach you shit, does it?  

Pour a shot.  Here's to your health.  What's left of it.

"event","Just got out of the darkroom at school.  I smell of chemicals and my eyes hurt from being without light for so long.  There's a solid four hours shot.  

Well, not SHOT I suppose, but I could have made it shorter and wound up a lot less frustrated.  I got the two prints I had to make for tomorrow's assignment done okay, but then I just had to go ahead and try to get in a few more prints of the Church I'd been photographing.  If nothing else, I learned this:  There is a time and place for Kodak TMAX 3200 film, and I went overboard here.  

The day I shot, the entire church was bathed in glorious late Autumn afternoon sunlight, and I thought the electric lights in the church would either overwash the shot or give it some unauthentic feel, so I turned them off (yes, all the lights in the whole place) and shot about 20 exposures.  

My frames are pretty much fucked.  when I printed the negative sheet (so I get little tiny previews of each picture on one sheet), there was a looming darkness covering the bottom half of my paper.  At least the outdoor shots are okay, but they're muddy.   The interior ones I'm going to have to do a lot of experimenting with and go through a lot of paper to get something decent out of them.  Unless a local Death Metal band starts showing interest, they're not going anyway . . . goddamn it, I'm disappointed.  The Negatives looked really good.

I need a coffee and a game of StarCraft. . . *SIGH*  But it's off to Stats . . . 

if you still want a sample, check out the pictures of the <A HREF=""http://dicechucker.20megsfree.com/church.jpg"">Church</A> and the <A HREF=""http://dicechucker.20megsfree.com/Christ.jpg"">Crucifixtion</A> I took.

"event","Well, it's been a hell of a weekend.  This Friday I burned the most KICK-ASSin'est CD, finally something I can listen to over and over again, the last one I made was sort of haphazard.  I've got some classic 80s and early 90s metal, and let me say, John Bush (lead singer for Anthrax) was awesome for the first three tracks of <I>sound of white noise</I> and two songs on <I>Stomp 442</I> and that's about it.  If anybody knows otherwise, let me know which album and I'll pick it up, but I'm pretty confident that was about it.  

Kyla and I also bought a kitten, named <S>Yoda</S> <S>Brooklyn</S></B> Dozer, as a playmate for our current cat Charlie.  It was a rough introductory period-- when Charlie wasn't establishing his dominance (ie, hitting Dozer) poor Dozer was busy throwing up little kitten puddles.  Poor cat.  But to be honest, it seemed like Charlie was really pretty much scared to death of this little thing that was about the size of his head.  They're doing well together now, Thank God.

This weekend was also supposedly the begining of a month-long D20 modern-setting Horror Campaign with my local group (The GM, a good friend of mine, <A HREF=""http://www.geocities.com/hellfyre_studio"">Dwayne</A>, is fucking amazing, but thanks to the overly-convoluted character generation for 3rd edition, this basically meant the group sitting around for hours without any of us getting any characters made.  

On the plus side, this did mean I got to sample Age of Mythology.  *Spontaneous Orgasm*  Too bad the disc won't copy.

Also saw the throroughly heart-wrenching movie <I> The Shipping News</I>:  I'm wanting to go to Canada more and more.  Now that's scary.

"event","Today would have been the 59th birthday of Barbara Jane Gallagher, devoted wife of the late Charles Gallagher, and loving mother of Fran, Patrick, Maria and Michael.  

My mom.

The last time I saw her, I was 16.  Everyday I'd go to Maimomedies(sp?) Hospital, and spend a few hours with her after school.  Usually, I'd be there releiving PJ or Maria, there was always somebody there.  Visiting hours meant nothing to us.  It all started for me, when I began noticing that whenever I swept around the house, there happened to be a lot of her hair in with the dust and grit.  Nobody was ready to tell me yet, and I didn't want to admit to myself that my mom was sick.  In the least.  But eventually I got the sit-down, and surrounded by my brother and sisters, was told that mom was diagnosed with bone cancer.  I cried, we hugged.  There was a Kodak moment.  

I dont know how long she stayed home after I found out, but my mom and I never talked about it . . . it's just what we Irish do.  Keep it in, don't talk about it.  We were more than comfortable with elephants in our rooms.  Things just went on, her health got worse . . . she eventually got a walker to support, but soon after that her legs were no good . . . her entire life was pain.  Everything hurt.  She finally left home to live the last few months of her life in a hospital, and when it finally became hopeless, she was admited to a hospice.  But we were there everyday.  

My visits were usually defined by two hours of awkward silence and small talk;  when she became incoherent, I started bringing a Game Boy with me.  I never prayed.  Never reflected about the fleeting mortality of human existence.  I hated being there.  I hated myself for feeling so detached from it all.  I wanted to feel different, but couldn't make myself.  

When she was truly near death, my father would stay in her room all the time.  I'd go to the hospital after school, only to have him tell me to go home again.  This happened a few times, but the last one was the one that never left me.  It was the last time I ever saw her alive.  
Dad turned me away, and I went to her bed to give her a kiss good-bye.  She usually wasn't awake anyway, but as my lips pressed against her clammy forehead, her sunken eyes snapped open and rolled up at me-- her mouth opened,  and I felt like she was crying out to me . . . her lips moved, no sound would ever come out . . . but it felt as if she were screaming.  Like it was all a feeble, desperate call to her youngest to rescue her . . . she knew I was there this time, wanted to say something, wanted to live . . . God, she was barely Fifty!  

But I did nothing.  I turned around and left, sweating ice.  Gradually I came to terms that there wasn't anything I could do, that this was in the hands of God now . . . but it didn't really help too much.  She spent her 51st brithday dying in a hospice.  On her 50th, she was having the greatest time of her life with Maria in Florida.  

What a difference a year makes.  Two weeks after, I got the phone call on Oct. 13th, 1995 that she had slipped away.  My dad tore the poor nurse a new one because I wasn't supposed to be the first one to find out.  
Coincidentally, I was also the only one present when my father died in the same hospital.  But that's another post.

Pour a drink and raise it . . . look upon the heavens and listen . . . for my mother, an old Irish Prayer:

Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there... I do not sleep.
I am the thousand winds that blow...
I am the diamond glints on snow...
I am the sunlight on ripened grain...
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you waken in the morning's hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of gentle birds in circling flight...
I am the soft star that shines at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there... I did not die...

I love you, Mom."

I'm sitting here 5 minutes before the class I was planning to miss half of so I could hammer out a one page paper on some of the third-rate art we have at the college.  (By ""third rate"" I mean works by such famous artists as Van Gogh, Whistler, Goya, and Cassat, but not the finished products;  we got postage-stamp sized sketches, cartoons and tiny prints that only cost a few thousand dollars)

well, I'm finished and now have an hour to just fuck around!  Life is great!  

Also, I finally splurged a whole $35 on a cheap ass portable CD player at the college store . . . it was either that or a $70 Sony discman that came in different colors . . . hmmm . . . gee.

It happened to be the last one they had, and I had a feeling the last one they'd ever have, so I nervously charged it and decided I'd live a little.  It sucked having to use the ""loaner"" headsets in the library-- Turns out this thing hasn't skipped ONCE all day and sounds amazing.   I'm proud of myself, thank you.

"event","When you were a kid, did you ever hear one of your friends say, ""When I grow up, I'm gonna work in some thankless beaurecratic machine!""  I didn't.  If you did, you must have gone to a pretty fucked up school.

But I get this feeling that nobody goes through their high school / college years wanting to work in Financial Aid.  Especially in an underfunded State college system that is just getting worse by the day.  If I learned one thing at City Tech (my old college), it's that if I wind up compromising for the rest of my life, I will at least get a job that I love.  

Because if you ask me, that's the secret to happiness, next to finding true love.  And perhaps having a huge penis.

Enter the Art student--  No papers, virtually no reading, and our most stressful times in the semester would seem relaxing to most other people on campus by comparison.  I think most other people see art as so theraputic that its almost as if its something that shouldn't be done as ""work"", it's not real ""work"" . . . You wanna know what real WORK is, artfag?  It's spending your night in the heatless basement of a greasy Chinese resturaunt, with one light in the whole damn place as you try to slice spare ribs on a warped chopping block, THAT'S A REAL JOB!

Sorry.  My other side coming out.

Especially when you consider that a mere fraction of us will actually make your life more enriched by our presence (and here I do not include that worthless pile of human flesh<A HREF:""http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/502.html""> Andres Serrano</A>), the whole pursuit of being an ""Artiste"" must seem quite humorous to the pencil pushers in the world's cubicle farms, ravaged by indegestion and an ass that just grows and grows and . . . 

But the truth is, God wants you to be creative.  Ask Van Gogh; he finally turned to painting as a means to worhsip after many painful, failed years as a preacher-- I look at it as the very presence of God within us; The Creator giving us his gift.

Call in sick today.  Brew some tea, not coffee.  Drive to the mall and buy something.  Even if it's just a pencil and a notepad.  Start that novel you've been thinking about.  Get your hands dirty, and the rest of you, too.  

Or just do what my friends and I did, and start using your computer for more than downloading porn.  Make today different.

Now where did that rant just come from?  it wasn't what I thought I was going to write . . . weird"

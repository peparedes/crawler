"event","So here I am again. Now I'm not going to spout some proverbial bs like I used too. No today or tonight really I'm going to talk about me . And ill let you be the judge . So I'm 23 poor ,work for the military and I have a family. If you'd ask me yrs ago when I lived in mobile how I see myself in 13 yrs I would've said just like the life I have now . Now I wish I could change it rewrite history you know stayed with the person I sang to sleep stroking her hair  in a wet leaking  tent instead of that women but I can't and even if I could change it I couldn't deal with the missing experience as much as I would love to change them. the  Lesson which I beg anyone who reads this to learn forget the looks the sex appeal look into their hearts. I saw her heart but I was blinded by my fear. Now if you excuse me I'm to try becoming friends with that girl I sang for."

"event","A man once asked me which was more important, Love or power to protect the ones you love? Back then I would have said Power... Power because I never experienced love and I thought I never would. I thought it was something that I could never obtain something that was always in front of me but out of reach. Now what is important is love not because of the feeling you get when you think about the other person smile or touch but because it is actually the answer to both of the options. With power you can only protect and perhaps even love but at a price. Love benefits all and gives you the strive and its own power to protect the other. By power it is not just strength but emotions, faith, and will. The things I have experience with Anh prove this to me. Love is not from the mind, you can't think that love is something that is said and ment. Its in the heart and soul of the person. Sadly this also means that it can be one sided too. I know people don't want to hear that but it is true, and hear me out. I know Anh through her family, her grandmother and her uncle. Both of them mean alot to me. Anhs grandmother used to talk about her alot, telling me how she was smart, beautiful, great personality, and had a moralic idea like me. Her grandmother was sure that Anh would like talking to me. Also one time her grandmother even said that maybe I would marry her and bring her to the United States. I took everything she said to heart letting it give me these ideas and build this feeling within myself that I didn't know exist until years later. My heart and soul cried out when Anhs name was spoken, when she was talked about, when I thought about her, And when I look at her familys photo. But at a point I believed that she was too far and could never understand like I didn't understand my feelings and so choose to be with another girl. I wasn't happy but I figure it best this way because I didn't want lose Anhs friendship knowing that I was falling in love with her so I kept silent praying that Buddha would watch over us and make sure everything will be okay. When I realize that I was in love with Anh I made no fight with Michelle when she cheated on me and left to go back to Mobile to be with Anhs grandmother and Uncle. During this whole time I wanted to do nothing but comfort Anh and her worries, to help her in anyway she needed it and so I am. I have told her that I love her knowing that it may never be returned to me but I accept that and I will let myself stay alone so I can be free to protect Anh with everything I can. See people this is the point I am trying to prove Love is better over power because I want to protect Anh because I love her and I feel like I can and will because so, with power I would only be able to protect her. Times like these are funny, readers take this to heart and let no one tell you that power is better than love cause love is the way, and with that said I want to just say one more thing. ""Love frees us of all the weight and pain of life."" By the great fortune cookie"

"event","The winds blew roughly on the old shack heat from the spell chard the one side that was facing the blast. ""I see you have grown stronger since the last time we meet Kel."" A man garb with animal skin stood strong bearing his giant axe held sted fast in his hands. Scars ran down his body like badges of honor, one noticable was the one across his throat which seemed to keep him slienced forever. A black robed wizard stood infront of him his robe flaring "" You are standing in my way from setting the world on the path that is right!!!"" The wizards raised his hand and spidery words came from his mouth. A ball of fire grew from his hands lighting the woods with flames. "" If you won't move then I will go through you."" Kel stood still his face stern and dirty from the last blast. A streak of lighting flew past the dark mage striking his hand as it pass. The wizard howled in pain as he grasp his hand, his turned his sight on the orgin of the lighting, there stood a wizard who don the black robe but was not completely taken but the lust of power his skin was tinted gold and hair of sheets of white. "" I can't let you kill him Vel."" Kel beam with both pride and uncerteny. He didn't know who he could trust one who was a black robe and the other who don them. "" Dross!!!"" Vel snarled "" I will kill you if you get in my way!"" Dross stood there holding out a hand already prepared for vel next spell and already recited the words of protection that black robes usually don't learn. Vel pulled out a wand of ebony smoothed wood and pointed it to Dross a stream of flame shot out towards the young mage. A green light formed in Drosses hand and as the flame reached him he out reached his hand and shoving his palm outright a green ball encase Dross reflecting the flame back at vel. The wizard fell to the ground his robes darker from the spell ""this is not over yet Dross."" Vel touch the ground and spoke the words of teleportation a spell that any simple wizard would know, in a blinding flash Vel was gone and Only Dross and Kel were left in the woods. A pale and stout man came out of the shack "" Kel? and Dross? whats going on?"" Dross looked at Kel and nodded "" It was nothing Sir Jeck."" Jeck looked at the two and wonder what had happen but his face showed his tireness and he ignored his thoughts and went back into the shack."

"event","He who called his past nothing
saw the world as everything
and life that he holded dear
made everything seem so real
Pain that was due to all ruin
a history that seemed like nothing
lost does this soul return to mourn what is gone
leaving a wake of demons and humanly sob
all but one who mourns the lovers faithful scorn
she the demon who said it all
ment nothing and took everything
what was sain and left of him 
was nothing compare to the brim
and now his songs of pain and lonelyness are constant creeds
what was done will be done
and justice was served
on a cold plate 
during a dinner date
with the devil himself"

"event","Pain:

Given time pain goes away
Saying goodbye to all that is sane
Leaving without such a parting goodbye
Many people rejoice many people cry
But what of pain makes it so wrong
Why must it leave
Why does it have to be gone
Who says pain is bad
And why do we feel it when we are sad
When parting is sweet sorrow
We know we will see each other tomorrow
And when we prick our fingers we bleed
It shows our labors from what we seed
And making what is wrong seem so right
That we hurt the people we love and make them take flight
But what if pain was a man
Torn from misery and from the heart break land
Wanting friend
Trying to make amends
And find a lover to have him in the end
And if pain was such a man
Could he ever love
Like some people who care for the white dove
Would he ever sing
Like some people who place words into meaning
And should he ever read a poem to tell a person how he feels
Only to find out later that maybe what they felt was not real
And do you know what is sad 
I am that man"

"event","The shallow steel hallway echo with the sounds of a group of men marching within its walls. In the front a highly rank officer leads the group to a door signed The Fallen. Sliently what looks like a thin frail boy, quivers in the corner his white hair covering his face. The leader of the group held the sign of halt and the echos of marching began to fade away. A man from the ranks step forward his clothes pressed neatly and stood stright like there was a metal pole up his ass. "" Sargent Tomas!"" the ranking officer bark. The highly ranking officer turn around looking at the soldier squarely from under his cap. Unlike the soldiers only a few selected people could wear the clothing of their choice. It was not because they were dumb to not wear armor is was because they were skilled enough to live without it. Tomas took his cap off and his jet black hair spiked from under it, bandages were covering his left eye with blood still seeping into its layers, he wore a simple white button up shirt with a pocket watch in the corner that he would check from time to time, A pair of plain black pants with bullets streaming down the sides, each in their own little slot for easy access and two silver magnums holster to his sides. Unlike his exterior his voice was gentle almost melodic "" yes soldier?"" The soldier stood firm and look at his commanding officer. "" If the fate of the empire lays with this young boy then we should kill him now."" Tomas place his left hand over the damage side of his face and look dismay "" It is not our place to judge our emperor."" The soldier look at Tomas then looked at the door. Tomas saw what the soldier was thinking "" Don't do it or I will place you in the brig you understand?"" All the soldiers in the ranks stood in slience as the one soldier stood there. Defiently the soldier reached for the door. To everyone else it was a blink of an eye but to Tomas it was more like days. One moment the soldiers hands were at the door then the next he was on the ground with his knees blown off. Tomas's guns looked like they never left their holsters but the smoke coming from their barrels said other wise. ""pick him up and take him to the medical room and tell Dora to patch him up."" Two soldiers step forward and pick the other one up and left the group behind. In truth Tomas would like the empire to survive but something was happening and he didn't know why. Tomas wave his hand and the troops started marching on again. As the echos picked up and faded away the quivering kid let out a sinster smile."

"event","Jonathan Story: I don't know how it started or when it happen. All I remember was that I went to Forest Lake View a long time ago but I can't remember what I did or who I saw. But it was only yesterday that I receive the letter that would change my life forever. ""Dear Jonathan, I have been here waiting for you a long time. How have you been are you happy where you are? Where have you been, I have been at our special place waiting for you. Don't disappoint me Jon please come and visit me."" The Letter was signed Amy and reading the letter and seeing how it was written it was like she knew me. After reading the letter I started to see glimpse of those days. There was a little girl at the pier smiling at me. I shook my head trying to get the vision out of my head. I looked at Brian seeing his face grow pale in his had was a letter he got. I wonder what it was so after French class I asked him. ""Hey Brian What's the matter?""
Brian looked at me with this strange daze look on his face. 
""Jon, I have to go to Forest Lake View tomorrow. Can you fill in for me at school?"" 
I look at him in shock. I did not know Brian had been to Forest Lake View and if so why did he not tell me. ""Brian I also have to Forest Lake View."" 
I handed the letter to Brian, He look over it briefly and looked back at me grinning 
"" Well lets get ready to go."" 
I smiled at him and nodded. ""Lets go.""
It was the last day Brian and me went to school that day. We gave notes to all our teachers saying of our leave and we went on our way. Brian drove up to my house in his old mustang and honks the horn. Looking out my door I yelled for him to hold on a min, I looked at my mother and my brother and bid them farewell no knowing what was ahead. ""Drive safely Brain.""
My mother yelled at Brian. I gave them both hugs and grab my bags and put them in the car. 
""Traveling light huh Jon.""
I smiled at him and said ""Only stuff I need Brian. Do you think we are going to find who we are looking for?""
Brian gave me a serious look ""I don't know Jon, Carrie has been dead for awhile.....""
I gave Brian an apologetic look and he shook his head at me telling me it was ok.
We were all set and ready to go, Brian started the car and took off my mother waving good bye to me. 

The day started well we got a good distance from home and were almost to Forest Lake View. I looked at Brian feeling awkward not knowing why he is going to the town.
""Brian why are you going?"" 
I asked him. He looked at me and handed me the letter he received at school. ""Dear Brian, Where have you been I've been waiting for you. Remember all those good times we had together? Where are you by the way are you still the little army boy I knew. I wish I could see you again please come down I got someone I want you to meet.""
The letter was signed Carrie a name I was not familiar with nor have I heard before. Before I could ask Brian he was already talking. 
""Jon, I know what you are going to ask me."" 
I looked at him puzzled. ""I knew Carrie when I lived in Forest Lake View for a short while. I had made many friends and I need to see them. So this was a much-needed vacation.""
I looked at Brian I smiled but I knew there was something more. He would never tell me the whole story. For some reason the drive took longer than we thought, so we pulled up to a local gas station. ""Hey Jon go in and ask how far are we from Forest Lake View."" 
I nodded and went into the gas station. As soon as I walk through the doors the smell of death filled my nose and I fell onto the floor with weak knees. I look up to see that a little girl holding on to a knife blood still fresh on it was smiling at me demonically. Shivers went up my spine as the girl reminded me of the girl in my vision. ""Was that Amy?!"" I thought to my self, the girl started to walk towards me holding the knife out to me. I panic and started to shuffle my way backward to the gas station door. I heard a voice behind me
""Jon what?s going on?"" I looked back with fear on my face only to turn back around to see the girl was gone and the bloody knife on the ground next to me the handle pointing at me The room was cover with blood seeming it was there for awhile. I looked at my hands and they were covered in that dark red substance. The store manager was crucified on the window that divided the cashier and the store goods his inside hanging out with the skin on his arms and legs split and pinned out, blood still dripping from his hands. The horrors struck Brian, making him turn away from the horrific site. I sat there looking at it feeling a sensation in my hands... it was like I could hear the screams of that man, as if I had done him in. But it was not possible cause it smelled like he was done long ago. Brian and I ran out of the gas station almost out of breath from the horrors."" Jon what happen!!!!"" 
I looked at Brian in shock, I could not even think straight fear filled me with unspeakable horror. I ran to the nearby faucet and started to wash my hands. 
I was on the ground looking at my hands feeling the pain they had cause. I could not fathom that it happen and decided not to think about it. ""Jon are you ok?""
I look up to Brian and smiled, sudden images of the girl smiling sent chills up my spine. ""Yes I am all right Brian.""
""Well come on lets go man things are getting weird now man.""
I nodded in agreement and we got into the car and took off. I slept for the rest of the way. 
""Jon we are here!""
I looked up staring out the fog cover window, we were at the old trails that the town had when people were wanting to go on a nature hike. Why is it so foggy? I thought to myself, it was never like this before when I was here and by the looks of Brians face he looked like he was wondering the same thing.
""Well Jon we will have to go through the trails."" 
I looked at Brian questionably. ""The car won't start."" He said with a smile on his face, I had the urge to kill him right there the feeling was so strong I felt faint just trying not to follow my impulse. ""Jon what wrong?"" 
I glared at him shaking my head telling him to not worry and go about his business. He pop open the trunk of his car and started to grab his stuff. For some reason I thought it was lucky that we packed in hiking bags instead of tote bags. I nodded to Brian to tell him lets go and we set off.. The trails were long and jagged we climb many hills and walk till our feet were tired. There was a cemetery on the trails so we decided to rest there for awhile. I pulled out one of my books reading it carefully thinking something as simple as knowledge can save us from any evil. ""What are you reading Jon?""
Brian said with a serious look on his face. I looked at him wondering what had gotten him so serious, I showed him my book of Shadows, a book that all people who practice magic keep records in. Brian knew what it was and turns his eyes away from it sighing in disapproval. ""What Brian? You don't like my mode of protection?"" I said smiling. Brian gave me a disgusted look making sure he did not accidentally look at my so-called evil book. ""Jon you are going to burn you know.""
He said looking mad at me. I looked back at him staring him down. ""Brian what I do with my life is non-of your business!""
Brian looked at me and he seemed he finally decided something. "" Oh so I guess it was ok for you to kill the manager of the gas station!"" Shocked by his reply I was quiet for awhile getting my thoughts together seeing images of the girl handing me the knife but this time it was on the pier and she was pointing to an dark figure in the background sitting down on a bench. I woke up from my daydream when a loud noise startled me. Brian had already duck down behind the rock, I sat on looking over to see who it was shooting. Not thinking of my safety I stood up looking into the fog and there she was again the girl stood there as if she was mocking me smiling at me but also sneering. We stood there gazing at each other, it was almost as if I could feel the hatred she felt towards me. The figured of the girl faded away when a man with a shotgun appears. He raised the gun pointing it to me and all I did was smiled, Brian looked at me as if I was crazy and he beckon me to get down. I stood there smiling cause I knew that it would not be long for even that man to die. As soon these thoughts went through my head the man was attacked by a dark figure, a figure that seemed to be as if they were the shadows themselves that moved with deadly precision. The man holds off the figure long enough to look at me and say only a few words. ""It's all your fault."" 
The figure took its hands and put them on each side of the man picking him up. The man strain hard and his eyes filled with blood and yet they did not take their gaze off of me. The figure lifted the man higher in the air, screams fill the cemetery as the mans head was crushed by It. The dark figure drop the lifeless body to the ground keeping it hands in the air as if it was praising someone higher than it. Blood still fresh dripping from it hands, in a quick moment it was the little girl again standing in the same pose as the dark figure. She smile and brought one hand to her mouth and lick the blood off of one finger. The girl turn around and looked back at me smiling again, with the voice of a innocent girl she sang a song as mother would sing to her daughter, skipping off deeper into the trail. Brian got up and looked at the carnage that had befallen the man, his soul must he shaken now I thought to my self. ""Brian I am still alive."" I said sneering at him, he looked at me defeated and turns his gaze to the ground and humbly walk off in to the trails. I quickly stop him, placing my hands on his shoulder. ""Here Brian take this."" I handed Brian a cross that I kept in my book. "" It will protect you in the future trust me."" He gave a shallow smiled and turned back around. He continues to walk the path to the town. I followed him through the fog keeping my thoughts to myself. Thinking why is that girl doing this and like why does it seem like I am doing all the killings. We got close to the town and had not said anything during the whole way. Brian looked at the lake filling sad for what he left behind and probably for the girl also. It disgusted me to see such feelings cause I was never one to be loved by anyone. My father skip out on my mother when he found out she was pregnant with me. I was never really wanted, I did not care all I needed was my books. I hated my father, all I wanted to hear from him was that he never wanted me, that I was an accident. But I was here and he was else where but what I wouldn't give to see him in person and have me tell me those words I never wanted you. I smiled with these thoughts and kept on following Brian, he seemed to know where he was going but he stop and looked at me. ""Jon this is where we split up."" 
He said without caring what happen to him or me. ""Sure Brian... I mean after all we have two people to find in an empty town."" 
I was just joking but Brian immediately walk off into the dark part of the street, only I would be able to see the light from the swinging cross that I gave him. As the light fade away I knew that something was wrong cause the air stood still and cooled. I looked around sensing the girl nearby, I scream out to her calling her name ""AMY!!!!"" But only laughter was her reply. The air grew fierce and blew dirt into the air causing me to shield my eyes. As the wind died down I moved my arm away from me, I saw that the town changed. On one of the light post hanged a child strip of its clothes, hanging with scars all etch into its body. Blood still drip from them. The kids face showed he was torture painfully. His eyes stared into mine, his lips blue and yet it seemed this were caused just a few min. I look down to see that the girl stood there her arms hanging by her side blood dripping off her fingers. She stood there smiling at me, pictures of her pointing to the old man again filled my head again. But this time it was a little bit clearer and the man took a form. It was my father and she wanted me to kill him, I had no need to ask why cause I knew, it was me I wanted to kill him and maybe I would. The girl looked at me again, she seemed to have grown into my age walking to me. ""Oh you've come back Jon."" 
She said smiling sweetly, ""Who are you, why do you want me here?""
She smiled and came close to my ears ""I want you with me."" 
The way she said it sent chills up my spine, I don't remember the girl and yet she knew me the concept that drew me crazy but I kept telling myself to keep it together. She smiled as if she knew my thoughts and she started to walk off into the dark beckoning me to come with her. I followed her coming up the ally I saw Brian and he seemed to have found who he was looking for. The girl was our age and she seemed to be scared to even come out of the dark. Amy looked at them both then back at me, I knew what she was thinking and all I could do to stop her was nothing I could not even move I stood there watching her smile cause she saw her next kill. The ally became darker and the girl Brian was with began to panic. Brian stood there holding on to her as the walls began to be cover with blood. He started to run with her in his arms but it was too late for the shadows begin to close around them. The figure stood there once again looking at Brian dead in the eyes. The eyes of hate shown in Brians as he stared back but the Darkness was unresponsive and backhand him up to the wall making him drop the girl on to the ground. Brian became unconscious as he hit the brick wall, blood rushing down his face. The girl screamed as the shadows begin to surround her. The dark figure grab her by the throat squeezing enough for her not to be able to scream and looked at her in the eyes. I could feel the fear fill her and yet sympathy for not the figure but Brian as if she knew what was to befall him. The dark figure took its other hand and rip off the girls right arm, she flinch in agonizing pain as the demon figure showed it to her. Ripping her from limb to limb it kept the girl alive to watch it all. The girls eyes turned toward me looking through me as if she saw nothing not even a shadow of me and she then closed her eyes. The demon knew she was gone and it was no fun to torture the dead but it was not done. The demon looked at Brian and knew what to do......Brian woke up to see the body of the girl mutilated, each of her body parts where strip and reattach it to the other part of the body. The girls body was hanged by her hair on a pole sticking out from the wall there on top of the pole stood the girl leering at Brian. I watch his anger rise in him then disappear leaving no trace but wind across his face as to mock him. Brians anger quickly rose to his states, his face was covered in the blood of his and his love. He was ready to get revenge, He turned to his eyes and me where red of hatred towards Amy and me. ""Jon damn you why did you not stop her!!!!!"" 
He yelled at me, I stood there wishing for death anything was better than this and yet I had to stand there. Feeling helpless, Brian grab me and drag me to the pier. ""This is where it all began...."" I said in a soft tone. Brian looked at me and was ready to end it here and now, all he had to do was kill me and it would be all over, but then my father came ""Jon look out!""
My father tackles Brian and took him to the floor. ""Oh good now we are all together."" I looked at both Brian and my Father with evil in my eyes. I look deep into their souls and all I could see was what I could feed off of. There pain would fill me and I would have that. Brian and my Father both looked at me and where shocked with my tone of voice and lay there fast. My body swelled up with all the hatred I had for everyone and the shadows seemed to feel my pain and began to encircle me. I stood there my eyes red from Hate and there was going to be no mercy. I became one with the shadows and my figure became as black as the night and as my soul. I walk up to both of them grabbing both of them with each of my hands
Slamming them against the wall. Brian fought back as did the man I once called father, but nothing held me back I slam my fathers body to the ground holding him down with my foot, as I took one look at Brian I said my Final words to him. "" Sweet dreams Brian be with your sweet Carrie, It was fun to finish her off."" I sent mental images of me slitting her throat and sewing it back up the blood pour over my hand and drip never ending from the tip of the blade. Brian eyes teared with anger and hatred. ""Jon I will kill you !"" I looked at him and smiled ""not this time Brian you won't come back."" With the end of those words I thrusted my hand through his stomach, my hand reach the other end and I pulled it back out. I drop Brians body and looked at my father. He looked at me scared, fearing for his own pathetic life. I pick him up next and stared into his eyes ""Say it ."" I said to him knowing he knew what I meant. He stared back at me and nodded ""You were an accident."" With that I finished it quick, Ripping his head off and slamming the body into the wall. The body hung there steadfast and I threw the head into the pier. Amy smiled at me and stood at the end of the pier like I saw in my memories standing there waiting for me, wanting me to be with her. My body covered with the blood of my father and friend, I walked to her and went into her arms. Amy lifted her arms as I stood right in front of her looking at her smile, with the cross that I gave Brian in her hand, the tip sharpen and pointed to me. She smiled and her last words were ""now it ends here...."" THE END"

"event","The years have gone by since I have seen what remains of that city. I can still smell the stench of my comrades blood on my hands as they turned against me. One by one they each took their guns and pointed it at me as if I was the demons we fought. When it was done, all bullets gone, just bare from teeth to skin I saw her. That girl who seemed to enjoy all the blood shed all the killing, all I could remember was wanting to kill her to choke the very essence of life out of her. ""hey man wake up!"" A short buff man grab ahold of a thin man slightly built, his hair was silver which match his grey eyes. ""Jack come on get up!"" Jack look at the short man and grin "" Was I sleeping mick ?"" Mick out of habit brushed his short red hair out of his face and laugh "" Looked more like a nightmare to me Jack hahaha."" Micks laugh made everyone in the truck feel at ease. Most of the men were at the age of 20 to 25 young.. too young for this war but it had to be fought. It was the year 2020 A.D. 30 years before the city what was once known as Forest Lake became what is now known as The Lone Demon City. People before us would  receive strange calls or mails being summon to the city but none never return. ""Hey Jack why don't you tell us how you got out of that hell hole?"" Jack looked up and stared at the youth. Mick came from behind and placed his hand on Jacks shoulder "" Let it go man..."". No one saw that Jack had balled up his fist and was ready to punch the kid but everyone got the idea not to talk about it. The light shining through the tarp covering the truck bed disappear and the sounds of gun fire and demon howls could be heard. The men who were so calm now grew tense with fear some were even crying, Jack and Mick stood there brave, once seeing the battle field now going back. Mick had no friends except Jack together they got out of that hell hole and thought they were never go back. Brushing the hair out of his face again "" Hey Jack think we will make it this time around?"" Jacks face was glum he, didn't even realize that Micks hand on his arm was trembling "" Don't worry old friend we will get through this again."" Jacks smile was a comfort to Mick sense it seemed that Jack never smiled at all. "" You really should smile more often Jack."" Jack ignored Mick and jump off the truck with the rest of the men as they reaches their destination. A high ranking officer came up to Jack and Mick as they grab their gear, the officer face was scar on the right side over his eyes his other eye seemed to penetrate their souls "" Jack, Mick Glad to see you again."" Jack and Mick both saluted "" Good to see you again Commander Zach."" Zach looked a bit disturbed when he approach them, he knew that they sense his distress "" Look men I am going to cut to the chase, we need you two for a special mission. Lets not talk out here."" Zach look around and guided Mick and Jack to his quarters "" Look we need you two to go in and find out what is causing all these demons to attack us."" Jack Cuts in "" I have told you it is a girl damn it."" Zach raised his hand to silence Jack "" There has been sightings of a man called Jonathan, he moves like a demon and commands some of the demons but unlike the other demons they seemed to only attack when we provoke them. Jack stood there in disbelief, how can demons be somewhat peaceful he thought. Yet why would the Commander lie he thought "" So where are we to go to find this origin of demon attacks?"" Zach smiled at Jack and patted him on the shoulder "" We had those who survive the demon attacks tell us where they were when they were attacked, they all seem to be protecting the tall building in the center of the city."" Jack looked outside at the tall shadow that was the building the commander was pointing at, he stood there remembering that it was at that building very steps where he saw her. That girls smile was not of this world he thought as he rub his hand over his face, Mick came to his side "" Jack there is more..."" Mick and Jack went back into the tent where the commander was waiting for them, to his side was a man garb in white he looked middle age yet a aura of wisdom surrounded, his body frame was some what built like a road worker or maybe a sailor. The man bow as Mick and Jack enter his hair white as clouds flow like the wind held it in its place "" Guys this is Seriphim we found him tracking that Demon called Jonathan."" Seriphim turn to the two and bowed "" Pleasure to meet you two."" Jack looked at the man he looked like someone he once knew kinda looked like his old man, Jack reached out and grasp Seriphim hand "" Nice to meet you."" Mick smiled as the two made each other known. Hours had passed and the gun fire and demon howling came to a halt, some of the men grew fearful that the silence they felt was them being dead. Jack and the others geared up, carrying their weapons around their shoulders and knifes in their boots. Seriphim on the other hand only carried a staff, no one knew how a man like him could just get around in this cursed city but none asked. "" Men Move out!!"" Jacks hand motion for the men to march into the center in the city, some of the men wonder why he didn't give any speech or words if wisdom. The answer was simple, he didn't believe in speeches or words of wisdom he knew you either lived or you don't and he already knew that they wouldn't see tomorrow. Jack lead the march with Mick and Seriphim, the men behind them march facing forward never turning their heads to look into the shadows. The city was run down, it was like something you would see right out of a horror film, debris in the streets stores windows broken and buildings crumbling. No one knew where the body of the slain were or bones for that matter, they all figured that the poor schmuck became what the city had become. They all could remember what it look like the prefect lil town, nothing to hide just a quaint town that the locals knew one another. Some parents were actually from the town and join the army to see what had happen to them, needless to say those who went out on their own never came back. Jack keep his eyes on those who were around him, he thought to himself if his last group betrayed him they will too. Jack was never a trusting guy as a matter of fact he didn't even trust his last team, Mick was the only one he could trust, a war buddy as one would put it. Mick never really thought much on the war, he actually wanted to be a teacher. The draft caught up with him and he had no choice but to go along. He was deserting when he meet Jack. Jack was fighting off his old platoon and more just to stay alive. Mick always thought that it was his better judgment that got him and that if it would have happen again he would have left Jack behind. After they both got away from the building they made their way back to camp and reported in, Mick didn't want to but Jack was determined too. At that time Zach was a Private and probably would never see Commander but any war had a funny way of promoting people fast. Jacks thought were disturbed when he took a look over at Seriphim his cool composier was something that bother him. Jack didn't know why but he could not help but to feel that Seriphim and him were fighting on the opposite sides. Seriphim sudden movement brought Jack back to reality just in time to knock the head of a demon that was aiming to bite at his head. Mick was around directing the men as he fought for his life shooting one then two then three. Micks face lit up as his keep his guard up, the rest of the men who live the first wave made their way into a alley. Mick was quick to join them when Seriphim Grab his shoulder ""Its a trap."" Mick look at him disbelieving but after the thoughts passed his head screams filled the alleyway followed by the pool of blood creeping around its corner. Micks face turn pale he knew he was one step from death. All the fighting came to an end Jack was holding one of the demons head back while the pistol was in its mouth, the demons seem to have turn to stone and none move. A man dressed in black with long flowing hair walk from a dark part of the street. Seriphim and the man meet eyes and knew one another ""Jonathan...."" Jonathan smiled as he heard his name spoken His trench coat seemed to flow with him like a cloak and a distinct Cross hung on around his neck, a cross that seemed to be repeated pattern on his black clothing ""Seriphim good to see you at last."" For the first time Jack knew there was more than just Demons and Humans fighting he knew that it was possible that even the gods had a part in this battle ""How dare you don crosses are you making a mockery of the holy one?!?"" Seriphims face was flush red, he held his staff tightly that the only white part on him was his knuckles. Jonathan smiled once again looking at the three who barely survive the demon attack "" Is this how you treat the one who helped you?"""

The consistent little references to Ames, Iowa throughout basically every book Stephenson's written started my suspicions back in the day when I first read ""The Diamond Age"" (the first of Stephenson's books I stumbled across). <br /><br /><div style=""text-align: right;""><font size=""1"">//Lord Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw was from Ames and has a bit of a flashback about it. There are plenty of other little references throughout his work.</font><br /></div><br />But Ames, IA is easily explainable. My mom graduated a year behind Stephenson from Ames High. Pure happenstance. Then there's random little comments about Ft. Meade and nearby Maryland. You know, the area I'm currently living in. And then, there's ""Interface"": nice solid scenes of not only Denver, Colorado but the crazy empty little suburbs spreading around the city. Seriously. Stephenson's everywhere that I am! <br /><br /><div style=""text-align: right;""><font size=""1"">//Okay, well to the extent that he's been there long before I actually get there. But I'm still arguing the point.</font><br /></div><br />That's okay, though. As long as he keeps writing tasty treats for me to read, Mr. Stephenson can stalk me anywhere."

Ooooh and Tetris! <br /><br />In general, the whole situation is quite pleasing. It was pure serendipity that we got one, as well. The Target on Powers (in Colorado Springs) was supposed to get a shipment of Wiis yesterday morning, and my mother was going to go pick one up and FedEx it to use. (This is after many driving-arounds and phone calls.) We went over to the Target here in Laurel to purchase something else, before the Target in the Springs actually opened. Target had a number closely resembling 12, completely unexpectedly.<br /><br />I have been allowed to name the Wii Herbert. He looks like a Herbert, just so you know.

Okay, not really. I'll be a check-in judge. People will show up to vote, show me some ID and I'll give them a ballot. Still, this whole democracy in action thing is kinda cool.

For Doris Lessig, I'm making an exception solely on her immediate response to finding out that she had won the Nobel Prize for Literature: <br /><br />(From Jezebel, <a href=""http://jezebel.com/gossip/clips/its-official-doris-lessing-really-is-our-fave-bitch-of-the-day-309980.php"">here</a>) <br /><blockquote>Today, the press greeted <i>Golden Notebook</i> author <a class=""tagautolink"" title=""Posts tagged as doris lessing"" href=""http://jezebel.com/gossip/doris-lessing/"">Doris Lessing</a> as she arrived at her home in a taxi. In the clip above, they tell her she was awarded the <a class=""tagautolink"" title=""Posts tagged as nobel prize"" href=""http://jezebel.com/gossip/nobel-prize/"">Nobel Prize</a> for literature, and her response is, ""Oh Christ. I couldn't care less."" She's the saltiest! What's not seen in the clip is that reporters then tried to elicit a more printable quote from Lessing, and when one of them reminded her about the $1.5 million cash prize she said, ""I'm already thinking about all the people who are going to send me begging letters -- I can see them lining up now.""<br /></blockquote><br />The woman is officially brilliantly eccentric, and I can only aspire to her level."

"event","By way of introduction: I like <i>Iron Chef</i>. I like <i>Iron Chef America</i>. I like the idea of rushed culinary battles based on secret ingredients. It amuses me to no end. So now, Food Network has offered up <i>The Next Iron Chef</i>, an elimination-style reality show. Luckily, they are eliminating real, brilliant chefs. <br /><br />I got excited about this. It may be a sign that I'm a bit addicted to cooking shows (and Alton Brown in particular), but I'm actually willing to watch a reality show. I was cheering for Traci Des Jardines, one of two women in the starting 8. She's been on <i>Iron Chef America</i> before and is pretty kickass. <br /><br />The first episode of <i>The Next Iron Chef</i> was last night. There was a race involving deboning chicken. Every reality show should have chicken-deboning races. Then there was a dessert making section, where the chefs each had a different savory ingredient (squid, chorizo, bacon, etc.) My girl, Traci, got salmon eggs. John Besh won the round with catfish truffles. <br /><br />Now, here is the sad part. At the end of the <b>first</b> episode, Traci was eliminated. I am so disappointed. I am at a loss for who to root for now."

"event","It really is. She sent us youtube videos of musical numbers from Bollywood flicks and began our horrible downfall.<br /><br />(Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />So, blame her for my subjecting you to a brief review of ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0172684/"">here</a> on imdb. 177 minutes of dancing, costume changes and very pretty people. Based on the subtitles, I believe that the title translates literally as ""Something Happens."" Additionally, I believe that the something in question seems to be someone falling in love (which happens several times). Then again, I could be making it all up<br /><br />One of the underlying themes here seems to be whether it is alright for a man to remarry if he is widowed. Rahul, the male lead, looses his wife in child birth and mopes around for about 8 years, doting on his daughter, named Anjali after his best friend. When little Anjali turns 8, she learns of her namesake (in an hour long flashback!) and deviously plots to bring them back together and score herself a new mother. She enlists her paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather in her complicated plot and discovers that the older Anjali is due to be married.<br /><br />Little Anjali ain't havin' none of that! More devious schemes ensue, culminating in her father and his friend running into each other at summer camp. Somehow, Anjali's betrothed is convinced to give her up and Rahul gets the girl (again).<br /><br />All this plot is surrounded by approximately 30 million songs, each with fifteen or so costume changes. <br />"

Aren't you especially glad I noted that I wasn't making posters, so you didn't think I was keeping girls in my freezer?

The real issue is that I made a cheesecake from scratch and it came out somewhat gloopy. But I popped it in the freezer and it is tres excellent when dished up and only barely thawed."

"event","So, I was in Ireland during the Six Nations rugby games. It turns out this is a bad thing, because I now think rugby is quite fabulous. After extensive bemoaning of the fact that American sports networks don't cover rugby, imagine my delight when I found out that whatever channel is number 75 on our set is showing the World Cup matches. *squee*<br /><br />I figured this out last night, part way into the England / South Africa match. As I understand it, England won the Cup last year. Last night, they lost to South Africa 0 to 36. That's right -- England, which basically invented the whole damn sport, got 'smushed like bug'. Unfortunately, it appears that my mystery channel isn't airing all the games though, so here's to hunting YouTube for random clips.<br /><br />A belated happy birthday to&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://neeman.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 2px;"" /></a><a href=""http://neeman.livejournal.com/""><b>neeman</b></a></div>, in keeping with today's Irish theme.

"event","Some of you may remember Hector, the aloe vera plant I obtained through entirely non-dubious means in Oliphant Hall. He's had a rough couple of months...

Let's step back in time for a moment. In March of 2004, I received Franz a.k.a. Fronds. Even my aunt, who sent him to me, has no idea of Franz's genetic heritage -- she asked the man at the florist's to send me something 'hardy'. And hardy Franz was. He survived 5 moves, months without water, years without sunlight and other trauma no good plant should be forced to face (leaf?). 

Poor Franz was truly killed through kindness. I spent the summer of 2005 at home, and my mother simply added Franz to her plant routine. He was watered regularly and moved outside into the sun daily. Poor bastard got used to it. When he returned to my tender care, he was bundled into the car for ten hours and then stuck in my living room. Sometimes, he'd get watered. 

Suffice it to say, Franz didn't do so well anymore. I noted his passing and mourned a bit. Eventually Hector came into my life. Hector's distinct phenotype argued in favor of his ability to survive my haphazard attentions, and he has generally lived up to it, thanks to vadius' regular reminders. D.K. and Charlie, however, have grown inordinately fond of him. Unfortunate little green thing. They believe him to be *shudder* tasty. He lived on the counter until 'The Cat on Plant Incident of June 2007', where upon he took refuge on top of the refrigerator. Last week, Charlie realized just how easy it was to hop on top of the fridge. This recent assassination attempt forced us to consider further relocation, and Franz took up a new residence on the balcony. My very loose watering schedule called for me to check in on him yesterday, and, well, he has not adjusted to the heat and humidity. My version of the Witness Protection program experienced its second failure. 

I had to take extreme measures. Where could I place Hector that was reasonably safe? It took me a moment to come up with at least a stopgap solution.

That, in short, is why Hector now abides in the shower."

Yeah. Right. Thursday not having an opinion. Thursday being quiet. *snicker*

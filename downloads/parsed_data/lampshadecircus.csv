"event","I woke up. I answered the telephone. I laughed. I brushed my teeth. I got dressed. I left. I was gone. I came back.

I am back. I hear the sound of two televisions entertaining one person and two cats. Wake up San Fransisco, it's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life. I've been feeling so exhausted lately and I don't understand why. It might be because I don't sleep and live on coffee and cigarettes, but who knows? I wish I could make sense of something - anything. You know what's one of the worst feelings? When you feel like you're doing your absolute worst at expressing the way you feel about someone or the situation at hand. I can't explain what I mean exactly. It's as if everything you say, anything you do...just all doesn't matter. It's as if you haven't done any of it at all. It's like...something like...it's as if it's all in your imagination and you're the only one who recalls it ever happening.

I will wake up when the telephone rings so loud that I won't be able to ignore it anymore. I'll answer it and I won't be able to stop breaking down and down and down. I brush my teeth because it's the one of the few things left that I sincerely laugh about. I have a funny smile and my cat tries to catch my toothpaste before it hits the sink. I get dressed because someone put clothes all over my bedroom floor. I left them in the closet. I swear I did. But for now, I am gone."

"event","a businessman purchased excessive amounts of tilapia today along with some fish food. the first thought that crossed my mind was, 

""how could anyone even a family of thirty three possibly ever in all of the time on the clock hickory dickory dock my thoughts are run on sentences tik tok EVER EVER EVER consume that much tilapia."" 

the second thought that crossed my mind was,

""so if they're buying fish food they definitely have a pet fish. imagine feeding your pet fish and then sitting down to eat some tilapia as your pet is just hanging out on the sidelines watching you chow down on it's long distant cousin. you know, that applies with birds too. imagine feeding your pet parakeet and then proceed to cook up some chicken breasts. isn't it kind of hypocritical and doesn't it all contradict itself? are the fish and birds consciously aware of what's going on at the dinner table? probably not. i just don't get how people can go from tending to a pet fish one second and then eating some really overpriced tilapia the next. who made up this shit.""

the bill was three hundred and something dollars. i asked the kind gentleman if he would have liked to donate a dollar to muscular dystrophy (jerry's kids shamrocks). he replied with, ""not today."" i wonder why not kind sir? haven't you an extra dollar to spare in your tight budget?"

I hear an icecream truck slowly driving away into the distance. I wonder how many people (old, young, miserable) smiled today because of that truck. I wonder. Speaking of icecream, the other day I was sitting on a bench outside of dairy queen, having some of my own. A little girl and her grandmother were eating theirs too. When they finished, the little girl began skipping around the sidewalk. The grandmother smiled as she watched, ""Try not to step on the cracks!"" she said. Afterwards, she got up herself and hopped around the sidewalk. They both avoided the cracks together and laughed the entire time. In that moment, they were both truly happy."

In an effort to truly find myself, I'm going to work on something I want to call, ""Project Me Day"". Once a week, for the rest of the summer, and possibly twice a month once school starts, I want to have days dedicated to clearing my mind and discovering more about myself. It wouldn't have to occupy an entire day, but for the most part, I would want to spend time alone. This would mean shopping alone without anyone's opinions, going to the park alone to write or paint, or sitting in a coffee shop with a book and my imagination. It sounds good for the soul, and I like the sound of that."

I feel that my whole outlook on life has completely changed within the last few days. I want you all to know, that even if we haven't crossed paths much or at all, I'm here. If you ever need someone to listen to you or if you ever need a place to stay, come to me. Let me know what's on your mind, I might be able to help. I want to help anyone I possibly can. In this World you're never sure who to trust, confide in, or just turn to when everything else has turned to shit. I'm here, and I mean that.

Today at work, a customer purchased lottery tickets from me. He had a basket full of things and after he paid for the lottery tickets he stepped away. I thought, like most customers, he would proceed to empty his groceries onto my counter and wait for me to ring him up. But instead, he stepped away. Before he walked too far I called him back over and told him that I could ring him up at the customer service desk. He responded with, ""Are you sure? Thank you so much! You really didn't have to do this."" I was amazed by his sincere gratitude and appreciation. After he paid for his order, his change was a dollar twenty-five. I handed him the money, but instead of taking it he put it back down on the counter and said, ""Buy yourself one mega-million lottery ticket. You never know, right?"" He left with a smile and left me with one too. Thank you to him, whoever he was, for doing that. My first reaction wasn't, ""OMG I MIGHT WIN 2343424234 MILLION DOLLARZ NOW."" but it was more like, ""Wow. What a selfless person."" I did buy the lottery ticket, and although I didn't win anything I wanted to write something somewhere to thank him for making my day. Thank you."

It's just like I can be doing something and out of the blue I will feel so disconnected from everything happening, as if it really isn't happening. It's not like an out of body experience or anything, but it's just like I get this feeling where I can't focus entirely and in order to focus I have to pay extra attention on what it is I'm doing. It's a similar feeling to deja vu, which i experience often as well, except it's different in the sense that I feel like I'm not entirely here. It doesn't last long, 5-10 seconds tops.

""sometimes you have to be strong for yourself, what is meant to be will end up good and what is not, won't. at times, people need to fight for you, if they don't, you have to move on and realize what you gave them was more than they were willing to give you, hopefully people will realize great things when they come around and don't lose something real. always fight, until you can't fight anymore, then be fought for.""

too late today tuesday morning now
untie me what was that scar
i took the fall for
i took the fall for

wait til i get my sunset
three little birds soon forgotten
three little cream sodas
when all you need is eternal sunshine
together,
together together

smile like wide open eyes
tire swing down apologize
rusted red rabbits and
last night austrailia's saltwater
lays flat my whole take on us
paint it one two
paint it three four

come as a wishbone
how i wish you could see 
sugar never tasted sour cherry
in the grapevine lafayette elephants
far away i listened in
miles and miles
miles and miles"

if karma's a bitch, why would anyone be spiteful?

i realize that there are other people who are less fortunate than me.
and i don't think that many people realize that about themselves.

today was a good day. except for the part when it was so cold that my nose fell off.
i hope they don't cut down that tree. on the way in tonight i gave it a hug, just incase."

"event","<br><br><br><br><br>Write 10 things that you wish you could say to people. Leave names out to keep it anonymous!

1. I miss you, but I know that I'll never have you back. You're not the person that I once confided in. I told you all there was to know and it amazes me that you remember little things that I had forgotten, and as you know, I don't forget much. You turned out to be exactly who I thought you weren't. It hurts and I hate blocking you out of my life when you're all I ever wanted.

2. The connection between you and I is amazing. I'm so happy that we found eachother and talk almost everyday. You make me so happy and I'm not sure if you even realize it. I think of you through out the day because a lot reminds me of you. Thank you for coming along and being there when no one else was. Words really can't describe how much I care for you.

3. I can't believe how things turned out for us. We had so much in common and I went through so much just to be with you. I wasn't kidding when I said I loved you, but I'm sure that it wasn't good enough. I wasn't good enough for you. What other reason would you have to carelessly throw our relationship away? and you didn't even do it once, but three or four times? I constantly had to prove myself to you and I don't know why. I went against what so many people thought because of what I felt for you. I still think of you, but I tell myself that trying with you wouldn't do us any good. I wonder if we'll ever talk or see eachother again. I don't understand what you're looking for, but I hope you find/found it.

4. You're full of yourself and it seems that you don't care about anyone but yourself. I never expected certain things from you and those things aren't what you think they are. Throwing away a friendship with someone because you're too cool for them doesn't make you cool. 

5. I'm so happy that you're back in my life and I'm sorry that we ever stopped talking. You've always supported and stood by me. Thank you for being what a friend should be and I'm sorry that I took you for granted.

6. I know that you're the only guy who truly enjoyed my company and cared for me. I just wish that things could have worked out for the better. I wish that I never hurt you. I wish so many things for me and you - if only wishes came true. 

7. Thank you for being crazy with me. I'm so glad that we've gotten really close over the past two years. I don't know what I'd do without our friendship because there really isn't anyone else out there like you.

8. I wish I could be as pretty as you. 

9. I still can't believe that you did what you did and expected me to be okay with it. You fucking disgust me. I hope that your lover leaves you and I'm happy that you're out of my life. 

10. I wish we were still friends. From time to time I find myself thinking of you and what happened between us. I think it's ridiculous how things ended. I hope that we hang out again someday."

"event","<br><br><br><br>it's so sad how it all falls down and how sometimes you don't do anything to break it's fall instead you just stand there or sit if your legs are tired and watch it piece by piece by bit by bit by one by one all day someday somebody has to change that though we have to fix whatever causes it to begin falling because if we did that cows could jump over the moon and hey diddle diddle wouldn't just be some bullshit nursery rhyme taking up time making you look up in the sky at the moon for a cow saying moo or fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you! and he would put an exclamation mark at the end, too. i don't need anyone and i haven't for the longest time, but sometimes i'm not sure if that's true. sometimes i think i need someone, but not just anyone - which is why i have no one. in her eyes, you see nothing - no sign of love behind the tears, cried for no one, who happens to be the same one who understands me. no one understands me which means that you don't understand me. i don't even know what this is all about. it's just a bunch of words that you can turn into whatever you'd like. i was just sitting here with those first few words dancing around my head, ""<i>it's so sad how it all falls down</i>"", and i just had to dance with them, make something out of them, even if that something was a lousy livejournal entry. but why am i even explaining myself?"

come back and haunt me<br><br>the ipod was on shuffle and alkaline trio began to play. it was the first time i sang the song in years, but i still knew all of the words. i sang at the top of my lungs and drove alone down haledon ave. it was about 1:30 in the morning, but the night skies and dim lights didn't keep me from knowing that i passed by. we use to sing those songs together. there isn't anyone else i know who knows them. i do that a lot with music, associate it with the people who use to sing it with me. i never let my memory ruin the music though. instead i sing alone and remember what it felt like to sing those words with you. 

i wonder if you remember too."

"event","<br><br><br><br>i've been so emotional today. i don't know what my deal is really, but it all started this morning. i was working in that grocery store, cleaning a register. out of the corner of my eye i noticed something moving, but it wasn't moving normally, and it was rather early so there weren't many customers. i looked up and i saw this precious and delicate old man leaning against one of those <a href=""http://www.ionmeds.com/WALKER,%20HEAVY%20DUTY.jpg"">walkers</a>. now that i'm thinking back, i'm not even certain that it was a walker, perhaps it was a regular <a href=""http://edweb.tusd.k12.az.us/sped/images/reallifephotos/Shopping%20Cart.jpg"">shopping cart</a>? well, whatever it was...it was letting him hobble along the shiny brand new floors of foodtown.
although i work often, i never saw this man before today, but the cashier a few registers ahead of me recognized him. she asked him if he had just gotten out of the hospital, and he answered with, ""yes and i'm so happy. the hospital is the worst place to be. i never want to go back."" they smiled and laughed at eachother, and he started heading in my direction. i couldn't look away. i wanted to say something to him for some reason. i wanted to tell him to have a good day. so i looked at him, and waited for him to make eye contact with me, and he did after hobbling my way a little more. he looked at me, and he smiled...so i smiled back. he stopped whatever he was leaning against and said, ""miss, may i have some of those paper bags?"" so i said, ""of course."" and i picked up a big enough stack, not too big that it would weigh him down, but enough to last him a while. certain people, especially old ones, like to use paper bags like that for their garbage/recycling...so i gave him enough. after i handed them to him he looked so happy, like a kid on christmas. he was very grateful and thanked me immediately so i said, ""you're welcome, and have a good day."" he replied to that with, ""thankyou! i want you to have a good day too, and god bless you.""
as he hobbled out the door i almost cried. i come across many adorable old people on a daily basis, but this guy just struck me a different way. i don't know what it was. i wanted to know his story though. yeah, why he was in the hospital - but a lot more than that too. i would have liked to just know something that happened to him during his life, something significant to him, anything he felt like telling really.
it's really just all so sad, all of it. there's so much i want to say, so much i want to let out, but there isn't any way to go about doing it."

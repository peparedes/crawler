"event","hey ppl guess wut .. i fouind the lyrics to a pirate's life for me wanna c?
Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.

We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!

Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.

We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!
Maraud and embezzle and even hijack,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!

Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.

We kindle and char, inflame and ignite,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!
We burn up the city, we're really a fright,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!

We're rascals, scoundrels, villains and knaves,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!
We're devils and black sheep, really bad eggs,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!

Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.

We're beggars and blighters, ne'er do well cads,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!
Aye! But we're loved by our mommies and dads,
Drink up, me hearties, yo-ho!

well yea that was the highlight of my day! cya later"

Mad at the world, eh?  You have a tendency to...<br>freak out easily.  Overly emotional about<br>everything, you're most prone to bouts of<br>cruelty and moodiness.  Other people may be<br>afraid of the fact that you explode so easily,<br>but at least you're honest... even if you're<br>honest about not liking anything.

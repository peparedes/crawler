"event","in your face melissa... im a genius.&nbsp; &lt;joke&gt;&nbsp; havent
updated in a long, long, time-my birthday is coming up and i cant
wait....i need to find sumthing to do!&nbsp;&nbsp; im so depressed tho
.. so sad, this semester is totally retarded , u just dont know, well ^^^ fyi-garden state is a great movie<br>
<br>

<lj-cut text=""ahhhh!""><br>
<br>
<font face=""Verdana"" size=""5""><font size=""2"">
This is where I say I've had enough<br>
and no one should ever feel the way that I feel now.<br>
A walking open wound,<br>
a trophy display of bruises<br>
and I don't believe that I'm getting any better, any better.<br>
<br>
Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring<br>
and I'm thinking awful things<br>
and I'm pretty sure that few would notice.<br>
And this apartment<br>
is starving for an argument.<br>
Anything at all to break the silence.<br>
<br>
Wandering this house<br>
like I've never wanted out<br>
and this is about as social as I get now.<br>
And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you<br>
'cause they would never do,<br>
I would never do, never.<br>
<br>
So don't be a liar,<br>
don't say that ""everything's working""<br>
when everything's broken.<br>
And you smile like a saint<br>
but you curse like a sailor<br>
and your eyes say the joke's on me.<br>
<br>
But I'm not laughing and you're not leaving<br>
and who do I think I am kidding<br>
When I'm the only one locked in this cell?<br>
<br>
So don't be a liar,<br>
don't say that ""everything's working""<br>
when everything's broken.<br>
And you smile like a saint<br>
but you curse like a sailor<br>
and your eyes say the joke's on me.</font></font><br>"

She's just waiting for the summertime when the weathers fine
She could hitch a ride out of town
And so far away from that low town good for nothing mistake making fool
With excuses like baby that was a long time ago
But that's just a euphemism if you want the truth he was out of control
But a short times just a long time then your mind just won't let it go

Well summer came along and it then was gone and so was she
Not from him because he followed her just to let her know
A dreams a dream
And all this livings so much harder than it seems
But girl don't let your dreams be dreams 
You know this livings not so hard as it seems
Don't let your dreams dreams
Your dreams your dreams be dreams"

"event","My only solace is that one day,
judgment will come for the wicked, then we will see who burns 
I am choking back my longing for shed tears 
So strangulated by my lonesome fears plead don't worry too much,
Oh, another social casualty
Score one more for meSo what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Our love was, comfortable and
so broken in
if you blink you could miss so much. please don't ever close your eyes 
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
That it won't and it won't because it can't
Because it just can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
ALl you need is love is a lie cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right
I called 
Because 
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away
Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
Split screen sadness
We share the sadness
Judge me, fuck you, stop playing god,"

"event","sitting here thinking about life..in general,.,. me and h are going to the game tomorrow .... so thats about all the excitement i have in my life...i just feel lonely 

last song i listened to this morning

Lift up a stone and you will find him,
cherish the beauty in the world around us 
Not in buildings or crosses made by man 
Judge me, fuck you, stop playing god, 
Your forked tongue prophecies,
carelessly caressing the wounds of the weak 
People like you should be crucified,
then maybe just maybe you would have an idea 
Of what you are talking about. 
My only solace is that one day,
judgment will come for the wicked, then we will see who burns 
Raise up your head, unclasp your hands,
your weakness makes me tremble 
True strength comes from within 
And we were given this life to live,
not exist under standards, set by some bullshit rule book 
What prayers of yours, were ever answered, by degrading others 
Spare me your biblical back peddling nonsense 
For the people that you've hurt, and the being your dishonor, 
Your fall from grace, will finally justify my means 
Judge me and now you are me and what's worse 
You are now a traitor to your god 
Tell me Judas, how does it feel to be looked down upon 
Sinners like you, should be stung up from the highest tree 
you judged me and now you are me, stop playing god"

What's out there? <BR>what is my eternal fate? it only just recently hit me that this life i just <BR>a state, mortality fading, like the innocence of love, i'm scared to death <BR>of whats to become of my immortal soul, of this eternal flame, will you <BR>remember? will your heart sing with pain? Who calls out my name? who can <BR>tell me what happens when my eyes close for the last time? does it all <BR>simply end in a blanket of darkness, what of my soul, what of my soul? All <BR>those things you couldn't say, you should have said, all those i love you's <BR>lost, weighed more like lead on your chest. What if i could take all those <BR>misspent days? every second of anger, i would wash my sins away. </TD></TR>

I understand now what i love you means <BR>it's doing the right thing no matter of the consequence. I'm tying you up, <BR>using the nicest lace, trying to kill you softly, trying to erase your face. <BR>All the while i'm doing my best not to rub my love up against your head, i'd <BR>redecorate the walls with your inner thoughts, but i'm afraid it's the wrong <BR>shade of red, but i have these sadistic urges and i don't want to take it <BR>out on you.

<TD height=11>Paranoia is the insect worming it's way through my subconscious thoughts, <BR>it's the larva of my self doubt, gestating in my heart as i spiral down and <BR>everything i touch is breaking and it falls to earth in splinters and i <BR>shiver as every splinter finds it's way underneath my skin, and after 22 <BR>years i can still make my skin crawl, every shortcoming a pitfall, on my way <BR>to making amends within myself to be what i became.

I lick my wounds trying to cleanse the <BR>infection, rabid and diseased reality fades away, when i pushed myself too <BR>far, a dream of emotional perfection has left a wounded heart, trying to <BR>perceive the gifts inherent inside me it's like squeezing the trigger, it's <BR>like opening fire on everyone who's let me down, on every beautiful lie that <BR>is only fiction for the first time, i'm losing control and i like it, <BR>freedom feels like the noose is gone. </TD></TR>

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me

Creation imperfect
Do you defy this? 
Could you and your swollen ego fit into my master plan for failure? 
I take the shame to heart and lock it away in a place thats sees not the light of day
I will use it when i see your face again
(your head in your hands and this is my cue, 
if three words could heal you i would only speak two, 
your eyelids grow heavy and this is my cue, 
If three words could heal you i'd only speak two)
How could you think after all you put me through 
and all you put on my shoulders that i would answer your cries for help? 
(How could you think after all you put me through

Sometimes things turnout the wrong way
you gotta stay strong, you gotta move on
the hardest lessons are teh ones that keep you stunned and speechless

i fell the pain 
i feel the hurt 
i fell depression 
i live in my strength

remember that your best friend is the strength in your heart
the fire in your soul
and the love in your eyes

though its been said many times before 
by smarter people with larger minds than mine
love in your heart
love in your heart will conquer all."

Gone...
We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing. 
We all know what to do but know one does it. 
Now this time has passed and full of regret.
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone.
When they get back, it won't be the same.
My life, you've always been there. 
Now you're gone and my heads spinning. 
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past. 
Moving on your time has run out.
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait. 
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends.

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life.
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night.

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past. 
So rarely I get to see your face. 
Growing I looked to you in guidance.
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me.

To me you were my life. 
To me you were my soul companion. 
Now you are so far away. 
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had.
Come back - to the days when we were young
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered."

Oh why cant I be what you need 
a new improved version of me 
but i'm nothing so good 
no i'm nothing 
just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
of violence of love and of sorrow 
i beg for just one more tomorrow 
where you hold me down fold me in 
deep deep deep in the heart of your sins 

I break in two over you 
I break in two 
And each piece of me dies 
And only you can give the breath of life 
But you dont see me, you dont... 

here i'm in between darkness and light 
bleached and blinded by these nights 
where im tossing and tortured til dawn 
by you, visions of you then youre gone 
the shock lifts the red from my face 
when i hear someone's taking my place 
how could love be so thoughtless, so cruel 
when all, all that i did was for you 

i break in two over you 
i break in two 
and each piece of me dies 
and only you can give the breath of life 
but you dont see me you dont..

i break in two 
i would break in two for you

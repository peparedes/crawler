sometimes the edges fall away
like brittle glass turning to dust
and we strangers in the wind
standing grasping unravelling cards

there is a time here, that isn't where
we stand, thinking perhaps we've gone mad
and the landscapes turn to smeared paint
little branches scratching the vastness

empty these houses,where home never lived
taking our shackles to the aquaphobic
empty the eyes where there sits only the moon
in a perfect curvature of the spine's drunken tune

and though perhaps, we mean to be cold,
we cannot suppress these avalanches, cannot
keep from crying in the middle of second hand
broken down, from the worn out clocks,

ringing in those hours before dawn,
creeping past us to shiver through storms
drinking the embers of half lit cocoons
and gingerly unfolding, like moths in the sun.

where is this place where nothing is present,
where the ache is backwards, and the cerebral persuits
chasing and chasing endless horizons
like wayward dogs, baffled coyotes shifting their pelts.

i sometimes feel like tapered glass
like brittle remnants of a disgraced past
i sometimes break so easily i'm fooled
that within this belljar lives a burning hell.

and though with carefully applied caution,
we still believe we may believe this
there is a long journey,marked in scrawled inks
turning and twisting and glistening wetly

before the jar is upturned again
and all we drew and all we insisted on
to try and form something more beautiful
something to startle the life back to our hands

we cannot begin the new swingset
without the wait at each station,spaced out
and ever persistent, in its salvation
when the lights are low, the glow is much more

than a soft encased tenderness, a brisk
wish thrown careless
and all the while we soldier on
in persuit of absolute
honesty. 

while we build our strength
out of shell fragments and allowance
we must gather the ends
of the feathered,tattered revealing

i cannot make a perfect ship,
i cannot look into the sun without blinking
i cannot drag myself from this effect
i cannot mend myself overnight

the impossibilities are as endless
as the realities of possibility
our choice, our stubborn goddamned choice
is to never let this take us
and leave us a shell.
never let the emptiness we observed
creep up and consume our souls
never let the endless nights
tarnish our unforgiving love
never let the darkness we carry
keep us from balancing within the light

like a softly rotating dancer
upon the dust of all that has fallen
from our mouths and from our persistence
to learn to fashion ourselves
into the best art we can manage..

"event","the winds tug at my sleeves,
like recurring spirit children, that persistent urgency
speaking snaking smoke into my ears
and peeling back black pupils
to startle, through burnt embers of dreams
ghosts trailing through the doors
and the semi-forgotten memory, as though
barely audible over the shifting
that bristling of high winds through my hair
tugging tugging
tapping my shoulder, and when i turn
there is mere vacancy,
neatly filled with silence.

i don&#39;t sleep, instead i dream
allow myself to be consumed
to leave the empty spaces,between pauses
and revisit ~ explore
what it felt like before, before,
before
and in the present
we etched the promises on our sleeves
and muted the breath of shivers
and tore our nerves out by the roots
and cursed and swore and made ourselves
out of soot,out of dirty rainwater
out of carefully fastened myths
out of honesty and realization
out of pointed compassion
out of softly sharpened razors
living here and then and
spinning round our love so obsolete
when dangers rang in, and the burning sin
when we broke glasses just to hear the sound
of brittle glass reverberating down halls
of forgotten rooms, faces living in them,
yet they peer out like distant reminders
of days gone down within our bellies
faltering wishes, bristling with defenses...
there is a silence, ringing in my ears
a thousand memories unraveling wings
there is alot to be said about how,
and why

the impacts of past are relevant
they had the power, in those moments
to construct or alter or instill
we built shells,when we could not contend
like insects, the exoskeleton to protect
built determination, to push through the voices
the ill fitted demands upon our persons
built fortresses around our hearts,
where even though we crumbled, or raged
or burned through pages of words
we learned to survive.
learned to manifest an evenness in storm
through the dust and harshness of realities
each one faced in different varieties
the pushes and shoves of expectations
the jeers and ridicules targeting our excentricites
the pointing fingers, the turning backs
the words that told us where we didn&#39;t quite fit..
the school yards,the streets,the darkened rooms
are left behind, but the impacts
that made us who we are
still wander aimlessly across our faces
from time to time, when we are caught
unawares, and realize

that everyone has a story, trailing back
to how they came to this, here and now
and the understanding we gleaned,
the growth and progress we made to see
the connections we make, the patience we give
the empathy, and then,sometimes the apathy
the hard cusp, and the soft underbelly
the tenderness we reveal, and the tough skin we wear
tracing back like ribbons to our back
fluttering behind us through times long passed..

its not always so easy, to break down doors
to wander back to those things we hid, or left
but it can be best to revive and confront
in order to allow&nbsp; passage through, to make peace.
a shift of the vertabrae of experience
to rearrange these puzzle pieces, and fit them
into an image that we can nod to
can learn from..can draw from.
the hollow of my hand still holds the scent
of rain on dirt and empty cupboards.
some things cannot be staved off, cannot be discarded
some things have roots that run through us
too deeply, and perhaps, they are necessary
as long as we can view them as gifts,
view them as drive, as inspiration
as those rooms we revisit, when we cannot connect
and they guide us, to better understanding..

i still sometimes stand, in the alleys like a ghost
roaming restless and chasing some void.
i still pace and pace, tangled in thought
i still return to those vanished fields, and the reminders
of what insight poverty can gift.
what being humbled retreives, what seeing equals
instead of filth, or glory, or jewels or distaste
i feel my undertanding is deeper, and i am grateful
i feel my sense of ingenuity would be different,
had i not had to make do with the little i had
and my creativity would be different,
had i not gone to art as my salvation, as my language
when i found it so difficult to look
you in the eye and speak.
i am grateful to have been gifted so many views
so many people passing through to show me
so many contradictions to poorly birthed ideas
that proved presumption wrong
proved that judgement is usually inadequet
that assumption is faulty in its action
that everyone has a story that is rich
and creates a complexity at which to marvel
wether from the streets or the gutters
or from the high end glittering condos..
its never as simple as a single word,
though for simplicities sake, thats what some turn to..

in the age of absense, and the burning void
the silence can be all consuming
in the dead of night.
i string beads of thoughts along the cobwebs
and revisit the sickle moon
i trace words down my ribcage
and dip my fingers in dark inks to smear
a little confrontation, from the unspoken voices
in my head and before my eyes, and onto paper
i burn a hole into the center
with my passion and with my rage
with my laughter and with this cage
around my head
even at the brink of dawn, i may find the keys
may break through drywall and metaphor
may create some maze through which i find clarity
despite the complexity
i like the puzzle, i find it freeing
because it forces thought to take new routes
get down on its knees to peer through walls
climb to the topmost branches to see past the smog
break this silence with my hammer
break these stagnant waters
break out of the prisons we build ourselves
without realizing how much we worked
to entomb ourselves, sometimes
in our effort to acheive freedom...

                        --></span>n from the eyes to reflect
the void in all its breath-taking
raging
repercussions, sliding down
into the empty doors, these empty houses
we built for the purpose of making
and repurposing
our souls,
as we kick up dust
only to watch it settle.

a hunger, built into form
trailing its sleeves in this filth
we made peace with
and entombed our greivances
to remind us
to keep us humble
in face of extravagance
in the face of success, after
years of starvation
created a heart out of scraps
and scrap metal.

a collection of faces
still stand, perfectly spaced,
delicately in shadow,
outside our window.

a soft dip, in the absence of
a slowly rotating cusp
that some days hangs back,
sometimes stands besides
and sometimes, drags our limbs forwards
in an unintentional
yet necessary persuit
of absolute
honesty
in expression
even if its hidden
within colors and shapes and lines..
bird song and harpsicord
black inks and coyote skull.

the images may be fanciful, the words
full of whimsy.
the toys we built are to help us
face the crushing weight we carry.
there is no accurate discription,
there is no definitive explanation,
the abstracts carry as much emotion
as the prescision may attempt to capture.
the diversion may be just as meaningful
as the descriptive accuracy.
and the masks are built to create
like all things expressive.. to face
or to gift,
we translate the best we can
we try to explain, or understand,
or hint or hide within new ways of contending
with the less easily shared
between one and the next
between us and ourselves
or for no other reason but the burning
and the dire need.. to take action
when we ourselves
are less gifted
in social dancing..
just to say
from me to you
and to be.

its many things..these lines that form letters
shapes in the vision of internal..
its my gift to you
its my breath, misting glass
its my fight against silence, entombed
its my therapist and my comfort
its my appreciation, spinning circles
its all the senses expanded outwards
its my strength, holding me up
its all my weakness, and the frailty cut in half
its my fears, holding me down as i dream
its the sweetness i taste, and the bitterness
its the process, holding out my limbs in dance
its my best language, and perhaps my worst
its how i deal, how i walk, how i stay
and how i show my love
it is my rage repurposed
its the expression of my passions
for this world, for all within it
for the little things starved i want to feed
its the overlooked - the small details gleaned
that give me the most joy, and startle me back
it is my faith, but never a religion, keeping my heart
its my seething, and my pacing along lone alleys
its how i show my gratitude for the things that touch me
how i face history, and contend with the things that hurt
it is how i survive..and how i give back
as i can

and it is very necessary. it is a need
or the&nbsp; shifting wings within
would devour me..
some people perhaps have no choice
they are driven, either by some jewel before them
or due to that which haunts them
which walks behind them
at an even pace,with a crocodile smile
and they only manage
to hurry one step ahead
or perhaps, its alittle of both
a sheer joy, a heartbreaking, the most urgent feeling
the need to translate to something
that makes sense, that feels real, or unreaal
that holds the weight that matches the worth
that can make those abstractions
into something new, something with equivelance
something familiar. or something reborn

the ragged wings that hold us
the tethers that contain us
the magnificence around that drives us
the silence that moves in music
the little coins within our palms
the currency of living, and creating
new steps in this neverending
twisted rusted staircase
never cease, even when they hold bricks
within our paths and on our backs
we are reminded
like all the keys we collected
there is always a door that fits them..
always a branch that alone
can inspire a whole new set of words..

and the empty space that lives
somewhere between trees and moon and ribs
holds our hands through the darkness
in lines of ink and typewriter keys
sifting through the hourglass sands
while we dream out the vagrant visions
dropped from the tip of our tounge
like a snake twice bitten, once rewritten
endlessly perfected and yet haphazardly executed
as we are."

the slinking symptoms
of disorganization, like torn paper
draping the half decayed globe on its crooked angle.
we stand at a vantage point,
drinking in the visual attributes
like a half burned prism, slowly rotating
within the caution of our inability
to consume too little
yet too much.

a burning dream, draped like cinders
at our bare feet
scattering coins and soft curling paper
marking the beginnings, indicating endings
a wavering transition
softly smeared charcoal at the edge of reality
like a wounded bird draped over abysmal

walking caution like a contradiction
eyes pinned like insects to the potentials
of never faltering, of always moving,
of never being..home
this metaphorical glimpse, this tangled thread
tugged around like a thought before its birth.
sinking floorboards, disjointed fingers
captivated by the burning cities
born before glass consumption.

there was never a home for linear here,
only twisting, denatured, broken - the cavernous interior
a vision of empty gaping doorways
etched onto flesh, and detached into the abyss
allowed to drift, like a renegade marble ricochetting
unappologetic, and likewise, unforgiven,
as it smashed through glass and wires and bone
to press for a new way of seeing
how we move..
and how
we stand still.

the burning embers at my feet,
like an everpresent reminder, a continual instigator
an untempered temper, a vision to excavate
in the ringing hours of sleep, or the lack there of..
drifting like the ship was lost at seas, because the storms
became its home.
turning over and over and over
from limb to lock to tongue to word.
we never built this structure to live stagnant.

and then when the night falls,
like a draping curtain, embedded with points that glow
and when the alleys turn vacant
like invitations for expression, blank and unchartered
and when the noise drifts down to nothing
empting this vacant lot behind our eyes
we may take breath, and turn on the lamp
and try to make linework of inexplicable
undetermined voices, nudging inclinations,
dragging our limbs over ourselves in an effort to find
the cracks in our skin, in our minds, in our dreams
and work them open
open enough to glimpse
the bridges between
and portray it as truthfully as we know how
in any ways, all the ways we have learnt
better than speaking, better than social vocals
internalized external indentations
along pale flesh and interlocking images
born to say what cannot be said
so simply, so easily, so one sidedly..
we work to create.

"event","It&#39;s a shifting of the line, a curvature of the spine
No matter how I set my card houses anew,
I never seem to be able to keep them
From setting alight in my&nbsp; hands,
curling cinders, and
a fallen angel.

Restless I walk like a tin soildier,
with a rusting key
along the bare back of the Moon,
endlessly captivated
by her pallid face, through shivering
tree leaves and distances renewed.

I drew the endless cities,
burned black and dragging
their sunken bellies, like visual enigmas
d
&nbsp;r
&nbsp; o
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their dormant realities,carniverous dreamstates.
A soft lined room.

Where, do these creatures exit
if not through the knots i&#39;ve created?
A bashful heavy handed gesture,
a brick laid down without prior discretion?
Winking steadily over the horizon,
the lights only cause me to question
as every moment I am left sifting
through the unsteady strings
hung from the ceiling.

Unrolled from the carpet, from the back alley
from the garbage.
My hands flew to the glittering promise,
that healing is somehow going to mend this.
That waiting and waiting and waiting
with uncertainty by the door, dressed in dregs
of tea leaves laid out
like prophecy, and inclination,
all steeping me dry like thorns.

I run to catch up, to this tugging string
I keep two halves in my home, at least,
an empty birdcage within my ribs.
There are shards of glass that reflect the faces
their teeth sunk into my soft flesh
in even precision.
A box rattles in the corner,
the contents have become uneasy.
I wander in and out
feigning fiction like a spectre.

(A might so strong it can level ground,
a tongue made of the finest silver.
A dress pulled down to hide the eaten,
a drama built of sleeping oceans.)

What is this empty room i&#39;ve built,
that houses ghosts, but forgets the living?
Where is the garden when all left are weeds,
draining the abyss of all its pride.
We chewed through our dark inks,
trailing from our mouths, and down our back
churning particles of sharpened words.
Letting the steps be placed before us
ringing,ringing.

There is absurdity, hanging his coat.
He lets me think as Time walks by,
tapping his coins together like sympathy
and shifting a smile through empty buildings.
I climb the fence, I walk through woods,
I search the trees, and tap the runes.
The magnets fade, the Moon sinks low
and all i have are buttons and loose songs.

Washing over me,
it all just washes over and moves on
like vigilant messangers,
born of feather and flaws
to keep me enthralled
keep my eyes open and my ears tuned
like the great concerato was waiting
and I kept kicking the dirt,
while the music faded.

When we fall, again to sleep
like a symphony of sinking ships
The thoughts unravel from our sleeves
like vast transluscent weighted sheets..
The mind is emptied for that moment,
overlooking the view
of a disarray of oceans.
And I lay my terrors to the ground
and bury them within the sound.

"event","a mask was built, the hell of empty conditioning,
put together with shaking hands,
dipped in vast silence, painted expressionless
like the void that built its house
at the center of her ribs.

wrapped in gauze, pulling fingers through wire,
she stood, mannequin pressed in powder,
dust and filth and empty promises
adorning her majestic limbs,
shaped like a dancer, encapsulated
by the empty-hearted
peering through the changing moments
with nothing to say, no words
no words but the actions...

we move our spines out of line,
our hands out to the darkened corners,
swiftly executed by our own lack
there of...(a choice made twice)
changelings to the ragged flesh
of sinking vocals, drinking
back the peeling paint windows
an entombed resistence
made of tinkering with our psyches
to find that perfect
find that perfect
word
before we all sleep.

the moment stalks the emotion
draining us dry, flame and dirt
tumbling from our mouths
like exhibition
the pale butterfly wings
soothing our cavernous dreams.
and when the world
stands still, all dressed in frills,
like the jewels that glitter,
but freeze our hearts with longing
for nothings,
in the end...
like the yearnings for make-believe
the never there,
the falsehood of what &#39;matters&#39;
your television is bleeding
and the cotorization
has halted.

spinning, we are left spinning
circles in the dirt,
trying to remember ourselves
as we walk endless hours
through darkened alleys..
the fuel is there,
but the translation is halting
when nothing makes sense..
when the perception of desired
is flawed.

stick your fingers in your belly,
we&#39;ve painted them in their mourning..
painted the dripping color,
the shifting constolations of disorder
the damage infected rectification
a minor swing of the hammer
weathered down to rust..
and the snow falls,
muting the glances
of the reminders.

there is the darkness now, curling in the corners
of a mind, splayed open
and it paws at the threads of light
that flitter in through
like sunlight pushing though curtains
transluscent
presenting the perfection
of balance..we never strive
for one without the other
even as we rake the leaves
of past regrets, bared teeth
dripping magnetism, shivering
through torn tourniquets,
to keep us whole
when we are least felt the same..
lest we bleed out.

the little ribbons, entwined,
together they create pictures
of doorways within walls,
corners within circles
and the neverending sting...
that neverending
sting
of life on our cheeks
like bittter cold, reviving us
returning the cobbles of winding streets
half basked in the light of stars

in all dark places, live slivers of fire
all charred remains there may be found
burning embers.
amber in their glow, cascading
broken down temples
to the cycle of remaints
the energy behind the wings
the shards that are broken,
yet still manage to catch
the light in their bodies..

each whole is constructed of parts,
each clockword method, typewriter keys,
snickering echos, past holding hands
with present
in that unseen dance
that makes us who, what
where we are at the core
striking out and striving on,
pushing ourselves up and out
to grasp at dreams, and all those
beautiful worlds
we built of matchsticks and gasoline,
butterfly wings and richocheting teeth.

in the heart of silence,
on those long walks we unravel
those ribbons, our charred skin
for renewal.
benieth the moonlight,
stumbling through endless
alleys
we hold it up to the light
in the dead of night,
that perfect pairing
of positioned views
from one corner into the open
doors were made to break
as if they were the jaws
of fate rewritten.

like the lips of a sick bird,

the past, in all his dust and burning heart
tracking fire through the depths

a snake in the bed of the fox
waking all the dark eyed chasms,
shaking the brittle boxes

the glass is shattered.

came down upon our silken heads

delicately dipped in gold.

the face may be drawn and hollowed,
the arms like tapered carved marble.
the body may sweep to one side

and her manner may be lost at thought,
bit lip and introverted,
shading her mind with a wavering gesture
like the dead glint of the death watch beetle
,fighting to say, but failing
in the catastrophic distance
of the silence that spreads out
out out out
from her mouth,
because most words just fall
to the floor
like scatterings of children&#39;s building blocks,
decks of cards,
spilled tea leaves.

the words,
all gilded and bejeweled
or rough hued majestics,
dusted in the remnants of time itself,
or the flurry of expression,
of eternity, a catalyst
compressed into
letters, built into strings
into sentences,
briskly abbreviated,
to somehow explain
somehow tell-all, in so little,
so much to say
of those unnameable little ways
in which life drifts ahead
and eludes even the greatest
descriptions, and explanations,
and expressions of utmost
uncontainable meaning.

&quot;i can write it&quot;, she said,she said..
&quot;i can write it all down&quot;
because, she thought,
i never have to say it
to you aloud
beneith the undescribable
way we are,
rendered wordless.

This is where it begins. Like a curling string, pulled from between dead teeth. A stretch of the imagination...
.
The amputation began, and the buttons were pulled and re sewn. We emptied our watches, and replaced faces, and cleaned out the dust from cupboards. Shed our retaliations for preference of internalised splintering, just long enough to bleed on those pages at perfect intervals. We took everything too quickly, then realised we had assumed too much. Sank our visions to the depths in order to know. Stumbled and fell and scrambled. Thought our hearts were all soft red tissue paper and eternity in the making. Thought the intellectual instigation of a sombre reminiscence was only a passing leaf, falling in the downward spiral. Falling before us like temptation. Made origami and called it a dream, opening our palms to the uncertainty of irrationality.

But where did the emptiness fall? Where did the chasm open up into? Was it like the golden carp that swallowed a star, taking it out into the vast streams of the night sky?

Perhaps not.
Perhaps there is always more than is gleaned from the first 6, or 8? Perhaps there is less to be said for the dismantled remnants of respect - once lost, they will take more to repair their brittle reclining forms. Slow stitch-work.
Still, way out, (a way out) across the stretch of the arms, as the sun bends down to dust them in gold, there are wayward thoughts. There are instruments awaiting a symphony. There are pieces of a puzzle that just don&#39;t fit in here. There are addictions to traffic diversions and sympathies to denatured results. There is an occasional loss of presence in present Time, and a difficulty in adhering to the linear path- going sideways instead of straight. A mix-matching of socks.

We built the card house, then promptly lit it on fire. &ldquo;Because there is nothing worse than boredom&rdquo;,he said, with that deceitful feline smile. And we still remember.. where he left a dangling light marked out in cobwebs of cracks. Where the &#39;roaches scattered at the base of barbed wire, rusting down the walls. The quick movements of cats in prison, pulled off the windows by insomnia.

Now, we walk endlessly in the night, with torn coat and fidgeting fingers, like we were sketched of fine wire and illuminated ghosts, bending through the memories like a contortionist in search of true love.
We still stand in the same place, with our toes neatly over the line, wavering.
We replaced our addictions with new ones, and re-moralized our approach to freedom. We drank dark whiskey and pushed our vertebrae to the limits, smoked down to the filter.&nbsp; And when we sink backwards into realisation, we find within there are only empty doors and mismatching magnets..one end just does not wish to approach the other. Cavernous rooms, echoing with heartbeat, letting us falter and dream of years long dead..
Like all things, they leave a bitter, wistful taste. A tightrope walker caught between fascination and absolute horror. But that bitterness always comes with a new song, and spawns the roots of new direction. And all emotion fuels dance.
We have no choice but be grateful.

&nbsp;One of the few things that calm me is strength encircling me like cast iron. The only thing that keeps me whole is my Art, and i have been seemingly losing it in a difficult custody battle, a tug of war in the absence of satisfaction. There is a restless fluttering of wings, a yearning for perfection, and a struggle for stillness in motion. There is a scar on my right hand that reminds me of how chemical burns the worst, and how apathy and empathy both break the heart the same way. I am looking for the scales of Anubis, looking for that perfect balance. The feather of Truth. Where the wind does not have all rule, and i can lay back without faltering..breathe easy..be still. If i could only trade cards for sleep, if i could find that hidden key to my back, if i could only stop betraying myself long enough to trust...

There are places, deep behind my ribcage, that speak across the prairie voice of level headed symbolism. The irony is not lost upon me. The twists i have watched and allowed and even welcomed, for the sake of that gift I once so coveted, have made a nest behind my skull, at the base of my head. There i take the steps down into the cellar, or upwards into the attic. I take the coins for my eyes and instead use them as jewelery. I must persist, even when I am worn down to the bone, its in my nature. Perhaps that&#39;s the existentialist&#39;s idea of juggling. Perhaps, that is just the prelude to nonsensical conversation with one&#39;s self. A sharp reminder of the years of devastation due to unhinged doors, and the fruitless effort to put it all&nbsp; together into something coherent and detached. Some thing that will shield us.. but then perhaps we could not live without that constant onslaught. We&#39;d starve.

The small door, drawn upon my back, in the shape of a keyhole, waits open, like a wound. The letters in my head have already been written, they are only in need of their appropriate illustrations. They patiently await Time as he shuffles his feet and slowly wanders. Draining the shivering dreams from the catacomb of battered changes, reinstating the edge of yesterday&#39;s missteps and stumbles to pull the trigger on the variation of skins. A new mask for every half-life. Yet it is a feed - the carnivorous drive. The cocoon of psyche, spread across the pages like a tangle of bent and rusted nails. It is where we translate, in the dead of night, in the back room of society. Locked and picked and broken down. When the shifting creeps up, a shiver in the tree branches. The sharp suddenness of life, with its jolts and jagged broken glass, stealing snickers in the back of my head whilst drilling holes into my pupils.
.
.
Some days it wavers, like a thin bland note, hung above the power lines like the stench of stagnation. Other days, the gift of spark, a reminder, a passing stranger, woven through the silence and the music, like snaking ribbons along a dusty sunlit path, enticing us forward... that reminder, through busted glasses and shoestrings, of where the drive was born, and how it burns if we stand still too long. How we cannot shake the desire, ragged and slow dancing through the rains, smearing paint and sounds and thoughts across the walls. That fluttering beat, constructed like moth wings, clutching at our heart. The words of the world, spun out through our eyes and projected, tripping through the alleys, in search of that perfect way to say, in as many ways, the abstractions in our head.
From me to you.

It never ceases to keep me enthralled, that I can be so completely in love, yet simultaneously so very disenchanted. As though those momentary inspirations, as well as those few jewels that lasted through the desert storms, safely stored in my head, have managed to generate enough power to upkeep my faith all these years. Maintain a faith in existence, in life, in humanity that so often shivers and crumbles into disinterest and distrust, so often is questioned and exhausted when all that hurts is overwhelming. A few beautiful phrases, those faces with that flawed perfection, some creative expression, and then History, and all the past keeps. The story of our existence, seemingly run in circles, pressed deep into the dust, but yet through so many changes, so many vibrant styles and extensive emotional triggers. How could I stop, when I am faced with so many senses portraying to me so many influential and moving experiences.
.
I dream, and often get lost. Softly sitting at the edge, peering through the glass onto a world streaked in rain and ideas and sugar. Drinking coffee and penning words onto paper, trying to unravel the contents of my skull, and the music in my spine. Like so.
I look to moving imagery, and to unusual pairings. I look for misunderstandings and overlooked details... I look for tangled, forgotten kites and the watchful crow. And every time I sit to write, or kneel at a bus stop or sit in the middle of a bridge at 2am, I spit forth from my brain such an inconsistent variation of possible nonsense. I let it be. I do not often know what I aim for, only that i must do so. There is a hole, dug deep within that burns and burns. There is an inability to feel at ease during social dancing, and the best thing i can say i have to draw, or write. Because there are still walls, built high and topped with jagged glass. I am not as muted, but neither has the compensation been cleared. The comfort is in the skin, buried within, behind blanket forts and shady dives, and the stories are told to tell you a little more. Ever so quietly.

recalling the tousled hair, the torn nails
,bringing back the never ending streets
winding backwards into my mouth.

we broke down, and we lashed out
and we stormed the oceans, like cascading falters
breaking our teeth down to cinders,

of empty tins of dry tobacco, the hollowness of poverty..
a single motion can startle back years,
and a long night can tear them back out of your arms.
the crossroads drag across our backs,
ringing in the hours with shards and splinters
drawn in watercolour, and sacrificed by ink...

empty out the dust, from between our lips,
empty out the crushed shards of glass.
empty out the sinking spine, and all its words
that promise never gave us..
empty the f e a r, separated into single digits
and empty our hands of all the luggage
that does not bare our name,
lest it takes our bones to make feathers,
lest we take our skulls to the drilling.

a curtain of fine lines, scribbled across this canvas,
a turn and fall, we cannot stop this energy we call life.
cannot seem to reach the things we stretch our fingers to,
as we dance upon the battered floors,
returning to be the most personal reflection we can offer
we cannot hide intensity beneith our palms, nor can we
hide the darkness smeared beneith our eyes
and trailing from our pupils, and from our mouths
like spilled soot, left behind from absent-minded
struggles held between
the teeth of dreams..

was taken,like other things,
with string and meaningless
words...

the things that stole our souls and fed them
against our better judgement,

twisting, and refastening, all those
hooks,
along our thoughts..

down the inverted spine, we take the meaning.
the little tangled fence that keeps
all the visual stimulation at bay,
and readjust the vagrant mistaken faces

the insects, with their shutter voices
creeping through carnival)

waking and faltering, there are still moments,
and moments of stillness.

tracing their wistful ideas over my shoulder blades

asking riddles and breaking the questions
of phantom paws long lost
to the upheaval of imagination..
tossing coins and feathers to the winds
in retaliation, in unintentional search for guidance
in search of nothing from anything,
standing insipid, mannequin arms extended,
words spiraled in the red ink
a story hidden within a panopticum
in the forgotten room encircled,
in impaled orchids...
walking crumbling walkways and sharksteeth,
eyes drawn to the unhinged branches
of dormant knowledge, pressed
within books and taxidermied wings
set up and stepped down
and leveled to sea level
with the quiet humming of blood pressure
sleeping behind sunken ships
captivated by the entry of soul...

they said, better keep yourself hidden, girl
better build a fortress round your heart
tie strings to your fingers, in order
to remember
and then, to forget.

there are towers as high as the stars
drawn taut as bows,
until we all fall down to the beginning
of where we ended
softspoken and hidden within
drawing rust particles from our hair
shifting to escape this

raging, we rattled our cages,
rattled our souls to the core
we scored and drained, made masks
and shut ourselves out
bringing in the rain for ..just..one
more flower...

"event","Once, amidst the leaves of discarded autumn, in the insnare of oncoming winter, there was a stir. A ragged sound and disjointed voice. Softly, in the midmorning drizzle, casting about like fog. 
It was strange, to say the least. Appearing as a conjuration in the base of the clustered birch trees, with silver bark contrasting the storminfested sky, starved and angular. 
What was it? That unfurled wings,yet had the jutting fangs of a cat... 
Even the thin man passing, dressed in frock coat and top hat, stopped at the sound and moved closer instead of away [ for he was,in this day and age, a bit of a peculiarity in the face of normality]. 
Whatever it was, it made a sound, as though between raven's wisdom and wildcat's clever ease, between vixen's trickery and jackel's hunger. Then it detached itself from the cumbersome tree roots and stepped forth before its single witness. The man, his curiosity and awe outnumbering whatever fear stood shaking its head,biting its nails in the background of his brain, took another step forward. He recognized the creature, having always been one to read mythology more frequently than mathematics. He spoke its name, the imfamous 'sphinx' widespread by news from egypt and its mystical beleifs, before he noticed. The sphinx looked up. Not necessarily startled or surprised by this human, but weary all the same. [Its difficult,sometimes,being different but 
not really all that much]. 
Gold eyes planted themselves unintimidated, and the wings shook out. The man didn't know what else to say, realizing he wasn't sure he needed another riddle to add to his collection. Life had given him plenty to chew over, and his mouth was still full. He decided to express this to the sheek creature before him. He began chatting, as though over tea with a friend, as the sphinx watched in mild exhasperation [it remembered why human conversation was mildly trying]. Eventually, the sphinx had to put its paw up, and the one sided conversation dwindled. Then it stopped. The man, put his head to one side, and then said the first thing the sphinx liked. &quot; Are you hungry after your trip out of those trees?&quot; 
The sphinx grinned a little cheshire cat grin full of fangs, and said &quot; if you feed me cakes, perhaps i will be so kind as to keep my riddles to myself&quot;. 
Thus,they went off to the nearest cake house, and despite the goggling eyes of many fellow customers, ate cakes and drank white coffee, and the sphinx kept his riddles to himself, and even managed to gain them free cakes when the man behind the counter got the wrong answer for his riddle. 
SO if ever there be a riddle in danger of being asked, by a sphinx born from the boughs of scraped silver birch bark, remember that even part human,part cat,part many other things type of creatures, have sweet teeth."

Its rolling up the shirt cuffs way too far,
bringing the hellion into the agenda..little tacks
and beckoning vagrants,paintsmears
and metal teeth
sleeping with the sunset
Its lighting bonfires in the mechanics junkyard and laughing fulltilt
Its gritting smirks during drowned pubstops, truckstops via returning
via breakdown, showdown, gunslinger girl,,spitting ice
drinking black coffee, watered down gazoline, sleepwalkin&#39;
clenching fists and playing firefighter
rolling cigarrettes,
sleeping in windows, sipping wine in beached ships
creeping blindfolded, smokin&#39; clipped cigars behind wreckage
walking detached staircases
and making mechanical switches
readjusting the conceptual visits
beneith the skin
of aged wreckage,shiny bright things
backtracking in search of wings
playing favorites..with the spines showing,
smoothly
jazz tapping, and smoke filled dives with bleak windows, ex-prisons
made posh with 5 course meals,
the fantoms of singers
hands held before us, at the exits,
breakin&#39; into the pound, with its beat-class spoken word
packed couches, cement floors and
overflowing ash trays
Its searching the streets for small change
counting sleepless eyes, all the sugar ye can find
and fruitless beggers, tipped fedoras
the sphinx smiling sideways, after the sobriety fades
a tinge of candle and radio overheard through a wall
catching soft inclinations of dawn
sinking slowly back
into an
oblivion of tall tales//

and we be

Enclosed, in the faltering breath.
cellophane cillinders,
enclosing, like clutching hands, standing bent
silk wrapped knots
tilting..on the moving streets. .
swaying, like the ocean,
the belly of silence,
a matter washing over the stones and razors
tipping over the edge,
chasing trains,snapping candles
drownin&#39; in dreams
like electocution,
heartattack and honey
lighting the matches,one after another
and
letting them
drop..
and when we unwrap our wings,
steering clear of renegade haystacks,
stranded hooligans,
the sun can shoot you straight in the eye
sharp as a dart,bright as newborn love
innocent and glowing
like a nightlight,
sharkattack in november
stampeding chainmail
just a catch,
just to night,
just one more time,
before the fact,after the time we
curled with grief,with this loss,
the blackened stairs, and all their echos
behind the stars,
showering us with pinecones
the gauges and the sweet calm
the puzzel has been scattered
returning to bolted doors,wrecking ball
like a gutted jack-o-lantern,
satelite and raven ,stranded
in the frostbit morning
churning, churning,
through the cards, hanging man
and the hermit
hands pale as fluttering doves
steering the cigarette
to chalkcaked lips, downstream eyes
raking the falling leaves, up to the entrance
to the exit
to fill the spaces
like these broken arches, missing sentences
half beaten steeples
rabid wildeyed seasons stalking behind
or perhaps,guiding the way
forward
onward,
backwards
like a wayward ship
telling of morphine sleeps
jackel painting his face,and weighting
the heart to the feather
of truth
[and why did you falter?]
riding beneith the slumbers
creeping along the wavelength in video
blearing into white noize
stumbling through distance
slipping between us,into mythtime
and an ache as wide as the mauve hour...
bleary and sedated,
convalescent in the inactivity
of still waters..
a calm before,the storm

when returned...
when retreived,from the gutters
the milky way is that much brighter

its broken my fingers, shutting all these doors
prising them open again,
snapping nails, tearing my skin
last minute changes,
shifting of gears, retracing unchartered
unexpected charcoal
figurines on the steps
picking apart my hair with chopsticks
dragging fingers over keys
and letting the weight
drop
and all the resistance
cultivated, after all the
backwords used, all the filth
strewn,
all the information left out..
scorn cultivates quicker than fungus
a little thread of
curiousity, rebellion to
the grains moving only one way
this motortrack is faulty,
there are a thousand directions![you know]
and this time
this time
there will be no crutches,
dependances on imaginary hearts,
shadowboxing
no leeches and midnight raging
no wet bandages to unpeel
while stretching to fix the lightbulb on the ceiling
,there are things growing,
little pupils going wide
there is a trail of realizations,
and a bedspead full of projections
a treasurechest of dreams
swaying in the ocean tide
catapulted from the stars,
and this skeleton will not wilt,
within its scarred skin
no muttering stream of jargan
beneith jagged breath,
electric currents keeping away the sleep
no rest, no peace of mind..
this will end
the spine of atlas is heavy,
but everything wasn&#39;t our fault
in the end
in the end
these scars cannot fade,
but the wounds may heal
keys spinning in our backs,
my face will cease to peel,
watching the rain behind window panes
tracing trees and breaking the programs
with my wooden hammer"

"event","She walked before the storm, along long deserted paths. Hands loose at the sides but outstretched to the night when little fingers seeked. This girl with her drawn down mannequin face wore peeling paint dresses and unwinding sweaters of soot. They came to cling to her icesculpted hands like missing children of the milkcarton sort, swinging and grinning through the delicate mist and smoldering petals. Here shadows peeled and lamplights flickered where she passed. Little monsters crept out from hiding to follow her lead,like rendition Pied Piper of the ethiereal, they moved in black water backstreets in the wake, eyes encrusted with charcoal like ornaments and curling limbs of dotted ink spills. Creepers of the Twilight, locked through fractured bass riffs at the entrance of Night upon tilting horizon veiws [where the ships are spun upwards to meet for tea with the starsss]. Like trailing smoke, the musick unraveled at her heels. Little faces appeared at the edge of gutter and sunken stone structures leaning inward as aged greiving. The realm of untarnished rusting magick ,of the veils thinnest moments, the Time of no clocks comprehension. Hair trailing through winds fingers like muffled beauty. Through the smooth clicking atmosphere, she walked tall despite the freezing breath of twisted metal remains and years upon years of distance. Lone tuning of assorted instrumentals slipping from the windows passed, they began to form like portals, gaping jaws from where they crept to join the cloud of beings in tow like trailing ribbons, linking to her in common and in difference, these sinking frames of Twilight made in motions. All mixmatched brothers and sisters, some thin birch bark wrapped and excavated fossil pressed close to slinking smiles that curled upwards in plaster,others held up bandaged claws with neverending songs fashioned of wayward wordless lullaby in the tangled ears of cryptick knotted flesh made of uncertain recollection. Others still wore hats topped with matted fur and whiskers turned upward towards beadwork eyes brightened like wildfire. Feather clung to wax backs and snickers tangled paws as they spun round and round and round,like backmasked sound..
The streets curled before her and behind her like serpents, cobbles akinned to rough worn scales in deep ringing color. She led the misfits and rambles through those darkened ways like Korczac had led his orphans,loyal figurehead to the long sunken ship eyes,ringed with stars even if they were meant to fall like comets..."

"event","When i find i&#39;ve lost..,
hands up!
to the pistols of life.
When i found myself, barricaded
behind masks and broken&nbsp;violins,
torn down bookcases
ringing in the hours with chalk.
Bringing down the curtains to rest
in uneven oceans of dust,
spinning cycles out like divination..

Then look down,at that tattered shore-
where does the core go .?
When the maze was made of doors.
When the mind became a neverending hall
submerged like the tip of ice,
curled up,beneath the stairs,
screaming wordless talk
and chipping away the paint..

Waves lashed the skin off our backs
and bent my eyes until it took
double-takes.
Walks were instructed crooked,
speech&nbsp;impaired&nbsp;misspelt.
Took all the doses down to 3,
slept on washing machines
breaking teeth
and swaying
backwards and forwards,
into any dream within reach..
Any picture made to smile..or seeth..
Stripped this wreckage of its nails
delt cards beneith counters within whales
and ate the sewage
from your mouthsss...

A savage was born, nurtured
and given flowers.
A train was stalled, at the wrong station
until nothing else mattered...
We unhinged our spines to stand tall
within&nbsp;the crowd,
only to realize that height was worthless
when within the center
stirred the limbs of los cadejos.
Breaking chains, manufacturing links
and raking the fallen leaves
of spent energies.

The scars were imprinted searing-
those words broke it, they broke it
and now there are hidden compartments
lost suitcases
trailing threads
backwards into the mist
fully aware and oblivious.
They drew complexities with crayons,
burnt cigarette holes into drywall
created valleys where once there were hills
And the bridges they burned

Oh how they burned
right down to the ground..

The structure collapsed, the rain swept the traces
beneath the carpet,
and how memory failed us..
How we blurred ourselves into focus..
Taking one card after another
until the houses we built met the storms
and back-splinters in the hands
on the sunlit floors,with dust dancing like chimes
and the tattered string.
How did he know this story so well?
I could point my finger,and thus,my blame
I could say i lost all trust because of them..
I could rage and starve,
break buildings with my voice..
make shifting the new craze.

But .
And here they held up their fingers
like silence was among us all..
Antlers and eyes illuminated, a seance
in the art of investigation,
deduction came from a leap
into darkness
into nothing,and everything,
and life
blown by the wind through your hair..
Sunk worse than a tanker ship
and all the hollows constructed
..there
beneath these eyes
[still bending too far back]

<span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">We waged a war,</span>
we took hold of switches we didn&#39;t even know.
We masked and altered,
strung prayer beads between thorns
sang low songs ,and dissected the moon.
Touched upon feeling, wilst banishing the memory.
Laughed in the face of danger
while being devoured by f e a r on the inside

Shut ourselves into stone cold-
so the warmth still never reaches
our fingers.
Stood against the whipslash of death
breaking murals to realize
the instantaneous cavernous
epitome of solitary
And do i stay,or do i go..
do i let the war consume me,or
let the potentials of day touch my face?
Without flinching,this time
without flinching,,..

The programmers had their hands in disease
the words created&nbsp;soldiers,
trained to stand as shells.

A song was sung,like reawakening.
Every so often it fades
and i stand on square one,
scattered like so many marbles
drained to think
that there is a way
beyond the window.
Beyond this room i return to,
caught recluse with nothing to say
nothing to tell you,but of the days
it all left me.
.
When emptiness fails,we walk back
into the schools where we were taught
in the sunlight of everafter.
When time skips,and our hearts follow
we make it wrong..
Stifled benath the absence
stirred into sleep for lack of better
advice.
Next time, there is always
a next time,they say
and what did they say,when they couldn&#39;t
speak?
When the faces turned inwards,
and
kept their distance?

There are struggles, as i watch
from my world of meager managment.
There is a philosophy to explain every action
never taken..
Words slip so much more easily into pockets
when we face ourselves.
Thats when the pendulum really began,
and every day we knew this, every day
we learned the lessons,
Of what happens when we dont pay attention,
straying like wounded dogs
standing at the edge
and inviting the spirit
inviting the vampires to our door..
Like the cure was the disease,
like we had Time by the hand
broken off the hinges,
basking in forlorn glories,
long turned to cinders,
seen through the keleidescopes
of faith.

A disentangled edge
curling like burning paper
straining after - that magick.
where we stand and need not speak
in the middle of a sinking feild
as the clouds race above us,
telling the wind the words we use,,
a simple storm.
.
When insects poured from my ears
there was a mark made.
When the ships sunk beneath consciousness
and the willow bent so low,
you could almost hear it whisper.
The string of&nbsp;chandelier&nbsp;laughter,
the vague distinction
between tragedy,and wisdom.
These shutters were made to keep us in
but our fingers were restless,
we peeled them away, periodically
to remind us
to remind us
That every step on this looming staircase
can strengthen a part
and our choice, is whether
it be monster or
fool..

Somewhere,along the path,
there stood an inverted sign.
Somewhere,along the trail of blood
there was snagged a sakura blossom.
And up on the roof
the sun shone on wards.
The samurai met the&nbsp;pharaoh,
an impossible birth was given,
the monster came to redemption
and
the sliding walls took a time to breath...
And i said,
&#39;my darling stranger..
why have I hidden my face
from my own eyes?
Why have i dropped everything
in my effort to regain?&#39;

When there are rings of glass,
and walks through fallen leaves
it&nbsp;commandeers&nbsp;like a flood,
better than any pirate so far..
This strange passion of life,
like a fairy tale swaying onward
on the ribbons of interest
undying through every blackout
through every trapdoor
infiltrating like a burgler,
moving smoother than a lushworker
in the underground.
I took myself down,and i took myself
away
I took everything i reached
and sunk my teeth in.
Now the lesson finally stands
knocking on my skull
with a burning sythe.
I took myself anywhere
but here...
beneath the horizon of history
scrawled upon my flesh
like leeches
i came face to face
with the new moment
and all the skies
that crashed with it
in creation...

sending pebbles off of rooftops;
safe and sound, drawn out like the eagle
curled into and out
caught up in midair, the great mysteries
stories mentioned in passing by Raven
the great simplicities...of falling
and a sensation, a fingertip to spine
backwards as opiates, sideways as the lines

this, eyes closed to the thunder.

and a silent speech,
shaken from the folds of fabric,like a granite river,
like stardust from the skies sweet oblivion
cradling life with affection,
instead of desperation..soft skin and
batting eyelashes
carried across the threshold of secrets untold
,a rainstorm of exsistence
and i ain&#39;t got no coat on,but i am still dancing
remembering
those cloudy days,and midmorning suppers
drank down like hot chocolat
with all the makebelieve,tucked away in a pocket
with string and hearts made of paper
we will reenter the world
hand in hand ,like guests and hosts,and
complete fools."

"event","insufficient funds,.in the backlogged sidestreets
skippin&#39; stones down those long winding alleys
onward the legs walk,pants scuffing at the chipped backheels
pinstripe and cigarette burn ,a miniature martini shaker
attached to chain and skeleton key
angular movements,hat held swinging twixt two fingers
doublejointed and expressing
black and white overlapping film,fresh outta the
dark room and smokey siluettes
tapping sharply out across yellowing floorboards
and over to one corner,as the bells on the door announce
entrance,and glance over sideways,
ordering with one hand,for that strong coffee,
over checkered counter,
the works of the place,around the corner
from the tobacconist and drugstore.

cheap salt and pepper shaker eyes
held bleak above the daily news,and the steam
from the spillring out on the table cloth
skips beats with the pennies tossed
over dirty fingernail,and stubble
of ol&#39; Ralph
ruffled down shirtcuffs with missing buttons
sewn in wrongside up,with skill
making faces up at the rain,dripping off the outdoors
like great waves of math problems
skimming the curb and past the butts,smoked down to the filter
down the gutter mouth,through the long metal teeeth..
and over yonder, that wiseguy in the corner,
the one with inconsistent names,always on the run
but yet always sitting right there
eyes turned up to the ceiling,and the single black fly
keeping his teeth sharpened
with the tension of it all,and those wings
cleaning them to put him off,but he&#39;s aware the moment he turns
the vermin will make away with his sugar
[he be watchin&#39; that one,and every so often,the door.]\
he knows too much about the anatomy of
a broken down sailboat with an etherfed woman
but no one knows fer sure..all just speculation
at this point,in this diner
turning backways
at the far end,where the ceiling begins to dip
and dive,.like a leaping goldfish
in orange pinhole galaxy
down towards the lukewarm soup before her
face turned elegantly downward
yet hands never making the full journey to eat it
eyes always lost to the dimonds
and the immitation lemur,slung carelessly
about her shoulder
yet here she sits,drawn by some magnetic lunactic
to meet over and over,at 1 dollar soup
and red leather seats in a booth
true love escaped her and headed west
but this love,forced and imagenitive,will last as long as she wants
till the mind clears again..

behind Lucy, sits the thin wire frame of Roger
nicotine stained teeth and fingers
a halfsmile straightened by sugar cube,tapping
ashes into the coinslot of the jukebox
lonesome smear of a long forgotten presence
he dines every day, on a bagel and some butter
refill coffee and cigarettes,that seems the theme
of greased back hair and interlocking knuckles
bright chip of pupils well fed on the commotion
as the waitresses move like pawns
over the chessboard, serving water and refilling empty cups
of quickwashed stonework
aprons tied with quick movements, in the backseats
on their drive to work in beat voltswagon or pickup
balancing plates like bears in the circus
always alert to avoid the pawings of the hungover

the mob smirks in the back there, all suits and tie
Italian or Russian or whatever that accent means
even Johnny over there, with his stringy brown hair
clinging to his cheekbones, two fingers tracing patterns in spilt pepper
tapping one worn leather shoe in time with the tunes
minding his business, but keeping ears open like radar.
Bill coughin&rsquo; up a storm at his own booth
thin sallow profile, sharp nose like a wellworn cooking knife
scrawling out symbols, for his newest documentation
of how the streets turned darker,and exactly how he helped them enter hell
on notepaper from a secondhand briefcase
leaking fountainpen and small errors here and there
making it more believable than his own flesh and blood
hunched over and consumed, by that compulsive mood
that thirst for expression, lost to so many
even with his drug induced stupor
oblivious to the children playing outside, in the canals
chasing each other past the bug splattered windows of the door
misted by the warmth, cheap lettering in faded yellow
scratched away in some places, by inconsiderate hands
that couldn&rsquo;t stop moving, scratching like nervous wrecks
in the mid morning over grease engulfed fries..

the old gentlemen station themselves near the centre windows
every day at precisely 12 noon, like a cloud
walking in to the sound of bells and haggard exchanges
taking off their shabby coats, checking pocketwatches that only barely work
releasing cigs from insidepocket crushed boxes
lighting and puffing and talking, with that near extinct way
passing around the news and waving veined hands for refills
toast and jam and eggs, tossed carelessly on plain white plates
single serving cream, and stale tomato ketsup
ringing up nostalgia, as they remininsce
wishing they had enough for a better cigar
and watching young Douglas with mild distress
the son of the oldest of the group
as he sits, thin knees up and crossed legs
the bones showing through his grey trousers
sipping his one cup,no food,but sketching the scenes
with a knifesharpened school pencil, tounge held
in the centre,between his little white teeth
[he decided on art college, when his daddy wanted law]
he was a sharpened mind, but his fancies took up most his time
and he was drawn to the down and out
like a vulture to a starving child
with talent that stretched farther than any court hearing
he knew it, but his father, Old Paccio, had been etched with distress
his thin mouth held it permenant in its lines
as he tried and failed at smiling, whenever he saw the lost hope
completely oblivious to his sons work, and for many years still
oblivious to the exchanges between Hazel the waitress
when she brought Douglas his coffee, free of charge
the look in their eyes when they constructed their own world
after work and after school, in the private recesses of the rooftops
dodging George, who didn&rsquo;t study anything at all
just slunk around the diner, hands in pockets, cigs clamped between thin lips
shadowed eyes glancing longing, in their direction
evident envy, a brittle infatuation, always hoping to be served
by the girl he would never have
and luckily he wasn&rsquo;t cruel, or aggressive and blind
just a cap pulled over his wistful eyes, and a battle to tear away
detach from the pain and realize he was only 23,
and that a whole world stood before him, if he kept his vision open
without barricading the doors.

the rain stops,the midafternoon sun creeps out of hiding
sending bright light cascading
reflecting in the puddles, spread like butter across the streets
around this corner,through the windows
enlightening the dishes and faces
the insomniacs and walkabouts
beatpoets and old worn copper voices
animated in discussion or inactive in deep thought
or complete silent musings
the diner of Broadway and Main, in small neibourhood
full of regulars with irregular personalities
clotting the atmosphere with their eccentricities
the flavour is one of a kind, you would love to see it for yourself
the down and outs,the scruff of the culture
just sitting back in your booth, put a quarter in the box
and let &#39;Virginia Avenue&#39; drift up with the smoke
absorbing the atmosphere like a spaceman on his first trip
behind the stars,above the marble earth
floating amonst the conversations,
the facial expressions observed out of the corner
of the caffeinated eyes, scribbling on the back of a placemat
writing out the stories of the people
the community of the small section of town
a taste like no other, for 50 cent refill, and tearing 4 packets
at one go, to add that sweet serenity
to the most nervous spinal injury
a nice stability, in the rollorcoaster of life.

"event","<p>&nbsp; The cigarrettes of random passing strangers left trailing snakes of smoke lingering beneith street lights keeping warm.&nbsp;It was late in the evening.&nbsp;A single man walked slowly down the persistently straight forward passages. At first sight he was just another passerbyer, but then the way he walked was noticed,perhaps. It was kind of unbalanced, as though he badly needed a cane, but at the same time he held a certain amount of grace, as a cat does. His face too, if one took the time to observe it, had an oddness to it. A slight tilt to his hat might have added to it, but it most definatly was odd. It seemed thinner than a common facial structure, and the eyes themselves were ever so slanted and brightbright gold. It was almost feline in the quality held, atuned to his walk. No one would point these&nbsp;details out to him. But it didn;t really matter. The impressions on each of their minds were made, and thus he lived on in their memories. And in essense, that was who he represented. Mesuire Memory. That flash of reminiscense, the embodiment of nostlagia...the basis of those occurences. That was his job. Though who knows why he resembled a cat.<br />&nbsp; Either way,that aside, his job was simple. He was a messenger, a deputy of sorts. Sent ahead of Memory himself to instigate the action of remembering times past in ones life or those of others accidentally misplaced on purpose to induce a sense of timetravel. It was surreal for sure. But then again, the mind was a mystery itself and anything as intricate as the web of memories woven was something to be in awe of.</p>"

"event","&nbsp; And then the sky blazed a madness of color and began to laugh. It seemed a sad tale but it was really just perspective when witnessed through a rabid keyhole. The windows,alas,had no say in the matter,despite all that was said in random rumours... 

&nbsp; When the walls began to crumble and all the silence was shifted into a room without doors, there was most definatly something to be said about the varied personalities that drifted though without saying a single word.&nbsp; The first of these was a gaunt man named Mr.Roberts. He claimed to be a&nbsp;most&nbsp;accomplished&nbsp;and well known performer of some sort but the rest knew he was merely a common piano tuner in need of a new proffession. The second of these selfproffessed 'colorful' characters was one named Samual. He strongly beleived he were part amphibian, and even went to great lengths to be submerged in water as often as possible,though, with his job as a swimming pool cleaner it was not difficult to stage an accidental fall and prolonged extraction from said pool being cleaned. The third of this motley crew was a young woman who never said the same name thrice when issuing introductions. She was seen most often wandering the evening streets in a feathered boa and nylon stockings, reminiscing about the second world war she consequently had never even glimpsed. [She had been born on a vacant beach in 60s California but had read too many history books while trippin' on acid and now strongly beleived herself a survivor of the holocaust.] 
&nbsp; These three barely knew each other, yet they shared the same building, and even had rooms next to one another.&nbsp;Yet they never spoke, and they shared their tea in silence every morning at eight o'clock sharp. The biscuts, even when burning by the woman of inconsistent names, never caused an outcry from anything other than the fire detector fixed crudly to the ceiling with duct tape. And every afternoon as they took the cat they shared for a walk, each kept their gaze strictly fixed away from the others. It seemed so bizarre to all the neighbours, and perhaps it really was so, but they seemed to liver ever so comfortably, each enclosed so neatly and consideratly in their own private worlds. The piano tuner endulging in daydreams packed full of excitment and creative expression&nbsp;found only, in his opinion, in the realm of performance. The amphibian man taking his happiness into the water, even circulating other places to bath so as to not hog the bathtub in their shared apartment. And lastly, the strange women snared by the history, seeing everything through black and white photographs."

"event","&nbsp;It was a restless night. One full of conflicting interests battling within his mind. All night it went like that,on the verge of madness,no resolution. Nothing helped resolve or disolve the loss of control. He fell in and out of dreamscapes ,like crashing through a surrealist's painting. A fitful sleep,&nbsp;even less&nbsp;rest. The mind was of a different intent that night it seemed,as logically he couldn't understand the meaning behind this sudden tremor of his foundations."

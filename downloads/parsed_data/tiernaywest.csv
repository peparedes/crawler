I want to go help with the rescue efforts, but Mom won't let me ... I mean, I know I don't have the training (yet!) to reach the peak, but surely they need help on the lower slopes, too, right? Or even at base camp--if nothing else, I make a mean tuna fish sandwich. What's the use of being ungrounded if you can't do the stuff that matters?

I tried Dad, too, but he just said that if Mom says no, that means no, and he wouldn't go against her wishes.

Required adventurer viewing.  I especially liked the part when they showed the climbers setting out in the dark for the final 12-hour climb to the summit.  (You have to set out in the dark if you want to also survive the 12-hour climb back down after.  Yes, that's 24-hours of straight climbing.)

Reminded me how much I want to get there one day.  Only I'm going to be prepared first, because too many people who try to climb Everest aren't.  And if I have to turn around and try again another day, I'll do so.  I want to be the sort of adventurer who manages lots and lots of adventures before dying heroically in my old age, which is much better than dying heroicly at, like, 11.

So, any ideas as to how an adventurer can begin getting in shape now for her future assault on the mountain?  If she doesn't like anywhere near real mountains?  (I asked.  Mom says we can't move to Colorado.  I think she only says that because she wants to live somewhere near Greg.  I think living near Greg isn't half as important as preparing to scale treacherous mountains, though!)

<small><sup>*</sup>Of course, what I <i>asked</i> for was a ticket to visit Base Camp.  But maybe I'll get that next year.  Dad takes my gift suggestions much more seriously than Mom does.</small>"

"event","<lj user=""janni""> is back in Heathrow Airport, after excursions into Basel, Bern, and Luzern.

She says nothing much adventuresome happened, unless you count a boat ride along the lake Luzern borders (no pirates, though), or attempting to pronounce French tongue twisters late at night.

I told her that sounded like a good start, but that if she really wants to be an adventurer, she shouldn't go back to Arizona yet, but book passage to somewhere like Dubai or Nairobi next, because those are places I know Heathrow airport has flights to.

She told me I didn't understand the economics of being a chronicler, or an adventurer either.

(Goes back to looking for cheap airfares on the Internet.)"

"event","Got a call from <lj user=""janni""> as she was changing planes in Heathrow airport, en route to Basel; she wanted to let me know she'd gotten the galleys of my chronicles proofread and back to our editor before she left.

But what I want to know is, how come she gets to fly to London and Switzerland, and I'm still stuck in South Newbury, Connecticut?  I'm the professional adventurer, after all; she's just a chronicler.  Isn't she supposed to be home chronicling, or something?

Some days, I fear I'm never going to get out of South Newbury, let alone make my way to the far reaches of the earth.

But of course, I'm an adventurer.  I'll figure out something.  (Heads off for nightly check of cheap airline ticket sites.)"

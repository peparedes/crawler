"event","what a day! i feel emotionally drained right now..in the last 6 hours so much has happened and so many decisions have been made. let me say yet again that i am not a good decision maker. 

let me start with this morning..i had to hang out in my dads studio while the cleaners did their cleaning so i did 4 BST assignments. :) then i went for lunch with my mom at downbeach and then we got our nails done..we had like a mini wednesday. i got like a pink..not that pale, yet not hot..i love it. i think its the greatest thing in the world having my toes newly done when i wear sandals, one of the many little things that make me smile. sooooooo then we went to my moms office and picked up my brother and the key to go see another house. my family is now leaning towards this house. its a couple houses closer to the beach, has a 4 car garage, a yard, ferfect setting for my dads studio, more ocean views and it just seems right. buttttttt i liked the other house better..i liked the fact that it was new construction and GORGEOUS...but yea okay, it didnt have a garage or yard...two very important things for my family..oh and it was on the corner next to atlantic avenue. this new house reminds me exactly of the house we are in now except to a nicer level. i dont know..i wish i could put the other house in this location with the same garage and yard. why not??? 

then i was walking the dogs up the beach with my dad when we decided that i was going to skip kentucky. the reasons being...mothers day, i havent been training, and my mom doesnt wanna be alone and its just a lot of traveling. so we booked our tickets for the naples tournament on the 21-26. 

ive also decided that i dont want to go to the prom in florida. i know im definitely going to regret not going to any kind of a prom this year but it just doesnt feel right. i know id have a blast with my friends down there but to me the point of prom is a fun evening with a date that you'll have fun with and as much as i love natasha, i dont love her that much. 

now the only other decision i have to make is when im going to florida to train because i want to go the week before naples but thats their prom week and i def dont want to be there when everyones getting ready for and going to prom. :( ughhhh. 

soooooo the good news out of all of this is that i can go out this weekend which i been looking foward to. there are sooo many movies that i need to see and some people i need to see. my three years of high school have been very messed up..freshman year well summer after i had wayyyyyy to much social, sophomore year i did go out but with the same 3 people the entire year and i think this year ive had almost the perfect amount. i dont know, i dont know why i make things seem so complicated.

"event","okay here it goes..

florida was amazing. i have been told that i describe everything as amazing..so florida was incredible, outstanding, unbelievable...okay? i ended up staying for a full two weeks. the first couple of days were okay with my mom and i loved having her with my at night but once she left it just made things a lot easier. and then the rest of the first week was just okay..the tennis wasnt that great and i wasnt having fun outside of it. BUT THEN after sunday night everything changed. I got three amazing roommates. i think i already wrote about some of this. so yea the week started to get better and better. After having some very successful matches i was placed with the group i needed to be with. I played one of the three top academy girls and I lost 6-2 but then i was up 3-0. The next day I lost to another top girl 7-6 after being up 4-1 :( but it was still okay. Thennnnn on like wed or thursday my life became better. I played another girl Alina Sullivan who is also top there. I had played her once before and lost 6-2 in one set but we were told to play a match soooo i won 6-4,4-6,6-3. I was ecstatic. But thennnn the FAU coach came up and talked to us and offered me a full scholarship. This wouldnt be that big of a deal if i wasnt a junior. Now that i know that..i think it just takes a tremendous amount of pressure off. Sure i know i could get full rides to any division 2 or 3 school but I just wasnt sure about d-1 yet. Anyway, im so happy. Speaking of the college choices, I also got a letter from Penn yesterday. My SAT's are already high enough for them. Talk about relieving even more pressure. So now my choices are Yale, Princeton, or Penn. I like the locations of all three. Connecticut isnt that far away and I love the area there, Princeton is close to home yet far enough away and gorgeous, and then theres Penn..i would love to be in Phila and its definitely close enough. i dont know. So on wednesday, thursday, and friday I also had private lessons in the morning. On wed and fri it was with this guy scott brooke who i met last time i was there and who had really helped me. My lessons with him were amazinggg (haha). He was Greg Rusedski's coach for three years which is pretty amazing. And the other guy I had, Shawn, who was also my coach during the regular time is best friends with Andy Roddick and used to coach him when he was younger. I am so lucky to be able to get the best coaching in the world. So yea thats my rave of the tennis part. Once again the food was amazing. In-between tennis sessions I would play ping-pong with Alex, Dylan, and Tim. Alex was tinas brother and Tim was his best friend and Dylan was just a roommate of theirs we met. While my roommates would watch us and lay-out. Then i slept for a little while the girls stayed by the pool. It was awesome. Then at nights we really didnt go on any of the trips. A couple of nights the girls that were staying nextdoor to us came over and stayed until like 11 or 12. We were just blasting music on a stereo they had bought from the target trip and just talking. That was a lot of fun. Then some nights we went to the jacuzzi and pool and other nights hung out with the guys. The best night was on Friday when first we went to the mall and had sushi with all the academy girls and then did some shopping at a and f. Came back to the resort and met up with the guys and then walked around for a little and then decided to go back to our room. Our counselor was really lenient with us and basically told us we had no curfew. We ended up having a party in our suite with just like 15 people. it was the girls from my room and then one other girl, and then the guys we knew and like 3 academy guys. My roommate Tina bought some of the guys cigars at the sports bar because she had just turned 18 the other day and wanted to use that advantage. lol basically all we did was play music and talk. it ended up being a true party with everything although I thought it was actually pretty boring. I stayed up until like 4 and woke up the next morning at like 8. Saturday morning the girls and i went out for breakfast and then we goodbye because they went to the pool and i went over to hang out with the academy girls. I then went out for lunch with two academy kids Dan (an academy guy from England) and Maiko. Maiko was from Japan and she was on my court once or twice. Thennn I left. 

alright i gotta go watch a movie with my family..

i wore sandals today. summer is in the air! dont worry i know its supposed to get crappy again but im still optimistic. 

im really confused on some things especially with some people who mean a lot to me. :/

im 90% sure im going to florida leaving on sunday --> saturday or tuesday or wednesday. that would be great to be able to train again and there would be a lot of people there because of spring break. so much fun. 

alright, i just needed to share my happiness with someone.

Well lets see, of course it would be to do something about the amount of violence that occurs each day. Its a scary place. 

19: Do you like to dance?:
I LOVE to dance. 

20: George Bush: is he a power-crazy nutcase or some one who is finally doing something that has needed to be done for years?: 
I am definitely in favor of George Bush. I think he is someone who is finally doing something that need to be done for years and actually taking a stand. 

21a: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?:
I dont know why i love the name Mckensie for a girl. 

21b: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?:
I used to have a boy name...i forget it! ahhh ummmmm i dont know..there are a lot of guy names i like..a lot. 

22: Would you ever consider living abroad?
I actually would love to go live in paris or italy for a year or so when im older. I definitely want to travel. I cant wait to Europe and Canada and Mexico etc. for tournaments this year."

"event","i have so much i want to get out of my head yet i realllly dont feel like writing tonight so heres a summary:

-did like 10 english and 4 pre-calc assignments today. im going to mrs. spiker everyday this week so im getting further along in that. i only have like 20 assignments left in english. my goal is to finish all of my 5 courses before the end of april. how amazing would that be? a little hard but i can do it. 

-ive been messed up on the date for like the last week and i messed up some deadlines and other things. congrats mitch..i thought monday was the 6th so i was a little early on the good luck thing. 

-im now starting to feel better so im going to go to the gym and start my tennis back tomorrow. im pretty excited. i dont know what im doing about going down to fl or with the training or the tournaments or anything. bleh. 

-ive decided that if by like may 1st or beginning of may if i dont get asked to someones prom then im going to sign up for a tournament or make plans to go to fl. i think thats the best idea anyway. i wont have to sit at the home the night that everyone is having the time of their junior year. 

-48 days until my phone and 3 months and one week until my birthday. oh man its coming. i think every entry until summer comes is going include something about how much i cannot wait for summer. this summer is going to be absolutely amazing. 

-my aim isnt working.

-i was invited to work with the USTA High Performance Training Center. They are going to have a pilot training program in NY on tuesday nights. this is the same program that is in florida that takes the top juniors in the country and trains them so that they can represent the US internationally. Im not going to do it though. Its all the way in Flushing NY and I dont want the coaches to discover my game. One of the reasons I am so successful is because I am a different type of player than most girls. 

-got some more clothes. i dont think i have to explain how happy i am about that. 

-havent really talked to anyone in a while, only friends from fl. weird. oh and i decided i am going to IM kim Zoltek. i knowwwww i cant believe it. i was going to last night but i was too tired. 

-this daylight savings change has realllly messed me up. i keep thinking at night oh its really only 10 (when its 11), i can stay up later. lol.

i think ill stop now. 

happy passover guys

in the middle of last night she banged her head really hard on the furniture behing their bed..like with the mirrors and then theres an extended shelf that opens up to hold blankets..well she was screaming in the middle of the night and for some reason i didnt wake up..she didnt go to work today..we both got massages..but now its 10:30 at night and it still hurts her..so my brother chad, the doctor, happened to call from aruba and told her to go to the hospital to make sure she doesnt need surgery. i know its probably nothing but im really scared right now..shes done it before but its never lasted this long. :(

im finally starting to get tired. i will definitely be updating tomorrow morning with one of my pre-tournament entries..im pumped up to the extreme right now. 

hope everyone has a wonderful weekend..i cant wait to come home sunday after winning my first G18s SRE..one match at a time.

"event","why is my friends page completely messed up!!?? the new entries are down halfway towards the bottom. this stinks..someone said it could be of a large pic and i thought maybe it was mandi's daria quiz but how come it didnt mess up other peoples friends pages. why mine!? what do i do now? thats the only pic possible unless its for some other reason. please help if you have any ideas.

today was quite interesting. a very funny and kind of weird day. woke up at 8:30 and then 9. i was on live journal for about and hour or two just looking around and looking at communities..i joined some and now i just left them because they take up too much room on my page and what possibly could they say besides hi im new or talk about how much they love the person. nod your head because you know im right. 

then i tried to do schoolwork but i didnt get anything done. mrs. spiker called me and told me to come in to see her today. i went to her at 1:45. i walk in and the bell rings..i was like looking for a freakin place to hide. i saw mitch..hi mitch. then i just waited outside the classroom in the middle of the hallway with everyone looking at me. fun..thanks mrs. spiker for being late. then i saw cris slotoroff. twice. not cool. then mrs. spiker finally came and we did three pre-calc assignments. AND THEN my brother calls me and says im leaving now. call me again and says sorry i cant come jeff will be there in an hour at 3:30. GREATTTTTTTTTT. so i go outside and sit on the bench and im like sitting there with a whole bunch of weirdos standing in front of me and im trying to call EVERYONE. called sara. no answer. called mitch to see if he knew where sara was or where he was. at home and said sara was coming back. called sara. no answer. called sara no answer. im sitting there and some sleeze comes over and sits down next to me and i get up and i start walking ANYWHERE and i see sara in front of me. oh was i happy. i met THE angie. then we were walking to sara's car when we saw scott's and decided to say hello. went to the classroom and saw they were busy. we left. then we decided to drive to mitch's to say hello. no answer. than my dad called and said im coming now be at the tennis courts. sara drove me back there and we waited in her car. listened to this love and with you. then my dad came. went to casels. 

faxed my pre-calc assignments in. ate dinner. hung around. got dressed. went to hebrew high. not bad. it def would not have been as cool if i wouldnt have had my camera. i will have to post the 903285957 pics scott and lauren took. laughed some more about the witch thing. that has to be the funniest thing of the year. its just absolutely histerical. came home and had a chocolate chip muffin <3 <3 <3. mmmmmmmmmmmm. talked online and now its 10:30 and im going to go to bed. i have bags under my eyes from being so freakin tired and not getting ANY sleep lately. 

im STILL siked for friday. still havent figured out what im doing with my parents dinner. will do tomorrow. and i also need to plan my saturday. should be an awesome weekend. once again. sara needs to get over her DrivingIntoMargatePhobia. BY FRIDAY WOULD BE NICE. 

alright thats all

"event","im in need of this update. i feel a little down in the dumps right now. :(

woke up at 9. had some raisin toast for breakfast. my mom stayed home in the morning because she hasnt been feeling well. i was taking care of her and then i got straight to schoolwork. i did about eight assignments today business systems and technology. instead of being 6 weeks behind (about 21 assignments) i am now down to about 2 or 3 weeks in 2 days. not bad. i just wish i could finish all these courses tomorrow. and be done with everything. i look up at my bullentin board and it is so overwhelming to see i have probably have about 200-300 assignments left. ugh. my school changed it name to the university of miami online high school. joy. 

i played some tennis today with my dad outside. my first day back is always hell. i couldnt move and had no energy. it was pathetic but ill be better tomorrow. im going to start training hard for my next two big tournaments. i really need to get in better shape and maybe lose about 5 pounds. with every pound gone i get faster. dont worry im not going to binge or anything. i eat like an animal but if i work out hard and eat right i lose easily. i just dont like to cut out cheese and desserts and everything. no more peanut butter pie or brownies a la mode. :'( 

my mom and brother have been fighting all evening because my brother messed up on a deal and they have been trying to fix his mistakes. they are screaming so loud i havent been able to get any work done and i could hardly hear american idol no matter how loud i made it. bleh. 

i finally got batteries and fixed my digital camera. i wont be without any longer. no more stupid disposals. i absolutely feel so blessed to be able to see my pictures instantly after i take them. to me its like a necessity just as a cell phone. sad but true. 

my dad told me he was pissed at me. and i think thats why ive been in a lousy mood all night. i think its because i havent been doing many chores around the house. its not that i dont want to do them its just that i dont remember. i mean i dont sit at my computer and go oh no! i forgot to empty the trashcans. i mean give me a break. remind me or something! 

i havent even had time to read second helpings. im on like page 30 or something. i think its because the beginning has been very confusing and not as interesting. theres like 10 pages on this band hum-v that i really could care less about. get to the good parts! 

turns out im not going to go to my awards banguet on saturday. my mom and brother are going away sunday through wednesday so my mom doesnt want to take another day off on top of that. and my dad would never take me. id have to go in myself. i know better than to say oh jeff will take me. sorry it doesnt happen. he would sit in the car and let me go in. so im going to miss it and i guess i really dont care..im just ecstatic to be number one after all these years. oh well. but that means ill be able to go out saturday night. so thats a definite positive. i feel like this huge important person because i finally have a opening. lol why the hell am i so busy. i havent been going out both days of the weekends for weekends straight since i was in AC. of course i like it but its weird to be social again. 

i need shoes. i need clothes. i need a lot right now. my mom keeps telling me ""ok keep working for me and we'll go shopping."" yeah right mom, while your working or while im doing schoolwork? i know its going to be awhile and i cant wait much longer. 

and on top of all that. i want a boyfriend. now this is a difficult topic. im never home and its not like im available to spend time with that significant other. i guess im going to have to wait yet again until the end of this summer and senior year. but then who wants a boyfriend for senior year only to be split apart after the summer. just dandy.

my brothers still getting yelled at in the other room. i really feel bad for him. he is such a caring, loving, sweet, kind..all those adjectives. but some times he tooo nice. and yes there is something wrong with being too nice. 

i dont know if i mentioned this but last night my parents flipped out on me since i am or now was 6 weeks behind on bst. so basically they told me no aim until im caught up. i mean im sure it will be tomorrow but other than that i need to stop hanging on aim. i used to think it wasnt that big of a deal since im on my computer doing schoolwork anyway and i keep my away message on most of the time. but when im not talking im going to start signing off. i think i cant really get in the mood to do schoolwork when i get interuppted by conversations. 

i basically would like to start a countdown until i get my new phone. i think about it everyday. i used to have the coolest phone and now mine is considered old school. may 24th is THE day. my big day. so that is (if im counting right) 84 days away. that stinks. majorly. 

if i dont stop now my entry will take up your whole journal. im going to try to post pictures now. thanks everyone for your help. not. i found it on the faq page but im not sure if i have the tag right. oh well ill give it a try.

"event","hmmm yesterday i woke up and went to breakfast with my parents at breakfast club and had raisin french toast. then i came home and i really dont remember the rest of the day. i was supposed to do lunch or something with janey beth but that didnt happen and then we were going to do it today but that didnt happen. oh well we tried. then we had dinner from jo jo's and then i got ready and todd drove me out to king pin. fun night. i dont know if im analyzing this wayy tooo much or if i could be on to something but ya know that game i lost to mitch. well during that last frame i needed a freakin 2 pins to win and i had all the pins on the left side standing..an easy task for me but noooo i didnt think and i bowled it to the right. i mean yea mitch you beat me fair and square but i should have won. and i think this is something i could def improve upon and it would help me in my tennis. i mean im good under pressure..most of the time. but then its those situations where i have to deal with the trash talking and stuff like that where i fall apart. oh gosh. well i dont know im not a pysch. denny's was funny. my brownie was amazing. oh soooo good. im like siked for friday. the talk about the signs and everything was great. and im not kidding. lol maybe. we'll have to think of where were going after. should be another fun night. i came home last night at like 1:30 and i def didnt get to bed until 2:30. i was about to come back online and update. i wasnt tired AT ALL. 

i woke up this morning at like 10..the latest ive slept in a LONG time. then went with my parents out to breakfast at ozzie's. i had lox and bagels..it was great. than ive been at my moms office ever since. i really didnt do anything great. i think they just like having an extra person. 

i went to the site about the ipod dirty little secret. and im not worried anymore now that they have the new program where they will replace it for $99. not bad not bad. i still dont know what to do with that. WILL I EVER GET A FREAKIN iPOD!?? 

i also want to know why the heck am i so violent. i think its from having two older brothers and them ALWAYS beating me up and me having to protect myself. 

lets seeeeeeee oh i would love someone forever if they told me how to post pics on here. i have some pics from enrigue, busch gardens, my moms award dinner, me playing tennis... PLEASE.

well i have to go pick up chinese food for dinner. ill most likely update again later because i had ""so much to say"" but i forgot most of it.

"event","alright my most important problem--- still not resolved. great. i got some cheering up and amazing advice from beth. beth you are the absolute best friend i could ask for and ill always love you no matter how far away we are. duke would be stupid not to take you!

anyway my day was a normal day. although i could not stop thinking about my problem. sooo woke up and went for breakfast at thomas's in ventnor. 

then we went up to visit my dads parents again since their flight was at 8 tonight. we talked and talked and then got them a pizza. it was fun. i also picked up second helpings on the way up. 

came home and got to schoolwork. i did seven english assignments today. tomorrow i need business systems technology. and then ill start pre-calc with spiker on monday hopefully. 

then i took like a three hour nap..i just conked (what a word) out while watching tv in my parents room. woke up and hung around on the computer and then i watched the o.c. from last night! i honestly was saying NO NO NO when ryan was about to kiss theresa. i mean come on! its getting a little ridiculous. oh and i loved how marissa and her mom almost saw each other..yea right! i dont like it when shows get this outrageous. does this mean ill stop watching?? NO WAY JOSE. but it is definitely getting crazy.  

then we had dinner reservations at 7 at tomatoes. i love that place. i had sea bass, salad, one philadelphia roll, and a peanut butter pie. mmmmmmmmm. then i came home and talked online and watched apprentice. 

then talked to beth and now its 10:30 and im going to wash my hair. yipeeee. not quite sure what to say about this weekend. im kind of speechless for the first time. haha i know some of you will love hearing me say that!

oh and my other biggest problem is my face is peeling worse than a banana. i was sooo tan and now its all gone and has been replaced by ugly peeling. its disgusting. just a warning. ::sigh::

ahhhhhhh goodnight all

"event","this is a much needed entry. i want to spill out so many feelings and emotions right now but blahhhhhhhhhhhhh i cant. what i can tell you is im mad--- mad at myself for doing something that i wish i could take back. 

i woke up this morning at like 9 or so and packed and got ready for the day. got breakfast and then my mom was off to the spa for the day. i hung around the room bored as anything watching the price is right and reading some lj's. got a text from sara, decided to give a call :) then i got my nails done at 1:30. even better this time. a light pink with white tips. gorgeousssssss. the girl was a snob and didnt wanna do it my way because she said it wouldnt work but boy-ya it did!

then i went and sat by the pool and ate lunch by myself. chicken sandwich...it was awesome and very relaxing. then went back and hung out some more in the room and then my mom called me and we left. we left for the airport at like 4:30 when our flight was supposed to be at 6 and it was a 30 min drive. so we get to the rental car place and my mom is flipping out and were carrying our superman and everything. 

we get to the airport and they tell us our plane was delayed until 7:30. if it wouldnt have been, we would have missed our flight. so we go inside and bag the superman up and finally check our bags and everything. my moms still yelling at me for no reason. 

honestly i know how much i brag about how wonderful of parents i have but my mom was an absolute you know what today. the middle of the rental car shuttle she yells at the top of her voice. you have to know my mom, she doesnt care what ANYONE thinks and if she yells at the top of her voice or how ridiculous she acts. it was such a challenge today to be with her. we've made up since but man i dont know how i do it. you seriously could not imagine. 

so we get on our plane at like 9. yes 9. im like calling everyone to see if they can tape the oc for me since we wont get int until 11. finally janey beth comes to my rescue! i love you. my dad couldnt do it because he was tivo'ing the bachleorette for my mom. in the end my dad found an old vcr and taped it for me but that was a close one. its sad how i would almost cry if i was to miss an episode. 

we landed at 11 and we came down the escalator to my dad and brother todd. we go to get our bags and pop! comes superman out on the conveyor belt and i grabbed it and gave it to my dad in front of everyone. it was histerical and he loved it! :D i was so happy. my moms going to use it in an ad so it wont go to waste. 

the flight home was mixed. in the beginning i was mad at my mom and we kept fighting but after we made up i talked to her the entire way home and she took my problem seriously for once and understood. ugh i dont want to think about it!

tomorrow calls for some serious schoolwork. tomorrows a very big day in some ways. 

ugh i was all happy and excited until my plane ride talk with my mom when i realized my problem. im crushed. absolutely crushed. 

alright well its 12 now and i need to get some sleep for the day of schoolwork ahead of me.

well yesterday morning we checked into the sadlebrook resort to stay here until wednesday. first we stopped at the real estate office to raise our offer on the condo and then i was a little late for tennis at 10:45. I got there and drilled until 12:10. Thenn i came back to the room and slept and relaxed and went back to play a match against a girl from france at 3:00. I won 6-1, 6-0. I was glad i didnt lose that one. Thennn my mom and I sat by the pool some more. It was pretty nice. Then we had massages at 7. I had the best massage i have ever had. It was incredible. It was orgasmic. It was amazing. Oh man it was good. ahhhhh sooooooo good. I was sooo relaxed the entire night. Then we went to one of the restaurants here, some kind of steakhouse and i had an awesome sea bass. yummm. then came back and tried to get online all night but i was having difficulties. 

today we woke up at like 7 or 8 and went to busch gardens! We got there at like 10:30 after stopping for breakfast. It was awesome. At first i thought it would be boring and i wouldnt like it bc my mom wont go on rollercoasters but it was great. Then we were in the middle of watching a show outside and a huge dark rain cloud comes over and it just poured. so we had a blast running from show to show in the rain. and i mean <b>pouring</b> rain. it was nuts. thennn we were playing some games and i was trying to win this life-size superman for my dad but i couldnt get all the milk bottles off the table i could only knock them down. what the hell?? gosh. so these two guys about our age were standing behind watching and one had already won a superman so my mom gave him money to try to me and he won us four little prizes. so finally one of the guys said he'd sell it so my mom bought it for $10 and gave him our four little prizes. lol so then later we see him walking around with around superman and he told us with the $10 he got from us he won on the next try. although he has to drive back to vermont..26 hour drive..so he doesnt know if he'll have room. it was histerical. we saw a whole bunch of shows, walked around with superman who was taller than me, went on a couple rides, did some shopping..got my name in pink mirror..it was awesome. all in all it was an awesome day with my mommmy. then we came back and ordered room service. its still raining and now were watching american idol. i cannot wait to come home tomorrow. to be home in my own bed, to be able to go out this weekend..galactic bowling, oh yeah!...and oh yes, the oc baby! besides seeing my family. 

I love this place here, i cant wait to come back. It is soooo gorgeous. i think you can see it if you go to www.saddlebrook.com
i was talking to my mom today how when i get my license in july ill be able to come down here with friends and since were going to leave a car down here ill be able to drive around and oh man its going to be amazing! im so siked. oh wow.

ok what else. im not sure what were doing tomorrow and our flight is at like 6. 

i wish there was more time in a weekend! ughhhh...i go weekends staying at home with nothing to do and these next two weekends im booked and all of a sudden everyone wants to do something. man. i guess its not a bad thing though. oh well. 

ok i think im done for now.

"event","yea i lost. 7-5,6-2 to this girl from puerto rico who has probably played on clay her whole life. i really should have won. then after my mom and i were fighting and not speaking to each other in the car she surprised me and drove to sadlebrook. this world-renowned tennis and golf resort that has the best tennis coaches atleast in the country. we checked it out and i hit with one of the pros for an hour. then we wanted to go to the pool but didnt have swimsuits so we bought some from the pro shop and layed out all day by the pool. i got diddly-squat tan. my face is burnt but the rest of me is as pale as its ever been and i feel asleep to a 90 degree day but no luck. it sucked. sooo then we were on our way out when we passed the real estate office and my mom went in to find out information and somehow we ended up putting an offer in $5000.00 lower than the asking price of one. we should know tomorrow if we are getting it or not otherwise my mom is just going to give him asking since she definitely wants it. so somehow we just bought a condo there. strange. sadlebrook is gorgeous. its like a mini world. it will be awesome to have a place to come down to with friends and stuff. amazing. sooo tomorrow im going to try the tennis program at 10:45 and then we might go to busch gardens and or else lay out again and then we are going to stay there till wednesday. :)

well i guess thats all the important stuff.

this weekend and week and month have gone extremely fast. i cant believe its already up to the last week in february.

ughhhh i have important stuff to write..i hope i remember tomorrow. gotta go to bed now. 

yours truly, 

a very excited dana ashley"

"event","well well wellllll. im here..in tampa. tampa..not bad, not great. ill cut to the chase about my tournament today. I lost my first match to the 15th seed 6-3,6-2. ok i was up 3-0 in the first set and then BAM! she wins six straight games. :( i went blank and got nervous and just made millions of mistakes. this tournament is on clay so its a lot harder to hit winners because people can easily run everything down, so the idea is to stay patient and consistent. i couldnt even get the ball over the net. it was nuts. i was just really upset when i lost..not mad just disappointed that i blew the opportunity when i was completely better than her. ugh. i guess i was mad at myself but not as mad as i was after playing 'the scratcher.' ok so i call my dad up and i start crying to him and he cheers me up and blah blah i have to play in two hours so my mom and i go out to lunch to panera bread where everyone was from the tournament including the girl i lost to. then we came back to the hotel and i finished sloppy firsts, showered,  and changed. Then we headed back to the tournament and i played my second match and duh duh duh..won. i won 6-3, 7-6(5). it was like 90 degrees out and the girl was really good..i was just better ;) i have to keep in mind that this not only 18 yr old girls and under but we are in florida where the best competition is. both girls i played today live and train in florida. they play a hell of a lot more tennis than i do, ill tell you that much. i think i won thanks to the good luck wish of belkins :) thank you sara. so i play tomorrow morning at 8. i play this little short spanish girl who looks pretty good but im not losing to her. 

let me backtrack a little..the flight down here wasnt bad..i just read my book. we got down here and then came to the hotel and then ordered in dinner from benningans (it was really good) while we watched the apprentice. i missed friends :( then the next morning i woke up at like 9 and then we had breakfast and then i forget what else we did but eventually we made it to the tennis courts and i hit with a random girl and then my mom left in the middle to go get a massage..so i sat by the pool reading, waiting for her to come back and pick me up. it was really nice and relaxing though. 

we went to walgreens later that night for water and gatorade and my slim-fast bars. while we checking out there was the crazzzzzzy indian women behind the counter. she started talking to the girl in front of us and was asking if they here with vacation or what and the women said she was here visiting parents and the indian women was like ohhh thats nice, must be nice having parents down here, most people cant convince parents to move here unless their rich and went on and on and then that women left and she just starts talking to us and goes on about how its not easy to come here from india it costs a lot of money, A LOT of money, people dont realize they are lucky blah blah she wouldnt shut up. we left when she was done with our stuff but man..she just was spilling out her entire life to everyone. it was pretty funny. 

there was some reason why i wanted to talk about thursday (the day i left) and wednesday night but i dont remember why. i hate that. and i also had something else to note that was interesting about yesterday. man. 

my moms at another massage right now so i just showered and im just blasting john, and waiting for her to come back so we can go to dinner. last night we ate at macaroni grill...the place where the kitchen is open and you can color on the tablecloths...its a fun place where you can create your own pasts dish..i just dont think the foods any good. so who knows where were going. i really wanna win both my matches tomorrow. that would be awesome. my mom should be back anytime now. 

i think because ive been in such an amazing mood lately that it didnt hurt as badly today when i lost. people just keep making me happier and happier..i hope i dont freakin burst of happiness. gosh. oh man i better win tomorrow. 

well i guess ill go watch tv or something..no one seems to be on..i guess since its a saturday night. darn.

"event","IM BACKKKKKKK! After a long delay, maybe a couple of days, I have finally found some time for my beloved journal. 

I have no room on my desk. I have my flowers from my aunts..almost dead and then my flowers from my bro and dad from v-day. I am surrounded and I feel like at anytime they are all going to fall off my desk. I guess its perfect timing since the first set has now died. I think they got jealous when the second set showed up and then the first set just decided to die. The first set was looking very pretty too. Who knows? Strange flowers. 

You should just take that little entry to my entry as a warning as to how weird this entry will be. It will also be long. I am feeling very funny/giddy/giggly.


I think I left off at Saturday soooo here comes sunday. I woke up blah blah blah, and then went into my moms office. Then came home and just had my final chance to finish my sat prep class. I had till maybe 7. Sooo i got cookin and I was on a roll (with butter) and just knocking the assignments down one by one. One of the assignments was to read a college level novel and then do an assignment on it, like find 20 sat words, definitions, sentences, plot summary, essay, thoughts, etc. Problem was I was supposed to read the book and I <b>completely</b> forgot about it. Somehow I pulled this assignment off and got 110 out of 100 points and a ""very good."" Wow is all I have to say. Luckily I had choosen to do Schindler's List so I knew about the story anyway. so I finished all the assignments in time and received a 100.26% final average. yay! SO I was able to go to the concert in peace. Oh and that average includes two zeros..i dont know why since i did the assignments. ok sooo the concert you ask?? one word...INCREDIBLE. I sat with Abbey dead center in like the 10th row. It was the second best concert to John. And thats pretty high since nothing will beat John except for another John :) Im sure you've heard about the concert from other people since there were a million gazillion teenagers there but..heres my version. We got there at like 7:50 and it was supposed to start at eight..but it didnt start till 9:15 and the only reason he came on was because the ENTIRE crowd was booooing. Theres a story in the paper today how he was supposedly sick. awww poor enrique. Now dont get me started on his hottness. man. He shakes his butt in tight-as-anything leather pants. Although i think he would be a very good stripper or pole dancer or something. The way he works the mic is very funny to watch..im sure women go to the concert just to see that. Ohhh and then he performed a song with a back-up singer and that included butt-rubbing and a wrapping of legs around a certain enrique and what looked like a kiss (but wasn't). Then he brought these two couples on stage to chill while he sang two slow spanish songs..there was this one couple that was on their first date and the guy would NOT stop taking pictures. Enrique was like relax man. And then the guy had to change his film and couldnt figure it out and while Enrique's singing hes like singing during his song ""if this guy could only figure out the film and relax"" omg it was histerical! Finally they got them off stage and enrique rocked the house. Every song was amazing..im glad he was sick and only sang 15 songs for an hour and 15 minutes. It was great that way..short an sweet. Okay enough there. Then my bros and Abbey and I went to a restaurant there. My bros had eggs and I had ice cream :p and Abbey had coffee. I had this huge vanilla ice cream with oreos and peanut butter cups. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Then I came home and handed in another assignment and went to bed at one! 

yesterday was pretty much uneventful except for when I played tennis with my dad and ate dinner and went to the gym. I dont remember anything else good. Then today was unreal. I got to bed last night at one also. And I had to wake up at 7am! Crazy. I was soooo mad. My mom woke me up to do her hair. I didnt mind though once i was up. Then i slept for a little and left for cherry hill to play tennis at like 10 or so. I finally beat this guy. This was huge! The guy I play with is amazing. He honestly could beat the Williams' and yes im serious. Hes a little shrimp with nothing but he is brilliant. Anddddd i beat him in two out of three tiebreaks. If i can beat him---I can beat any girl in this country. Easily. yay! I always play well when i take breaks from tennis. its ironic and i love it. thenn i came home and had half a mack and manco's pizza. mmm. 

omg! my jessica simpson song just came on..i took a little break to sing every single word. the lyrics are just incredible. they are so real. now john mayer wonderland came on. this rocks. ok now where was i.

so i had half a pizza  for lunch so for dinner i just had like two spoonfuls of vegetables. peas, string beas, and corn. yumm. surprisingly not hungry. I think that was a first. then i went to the gym. Thats going well also. Ive never run so fast in my life. Ive been pushing myself to run at like 7.0 and 8.0. how? Im not sure. Then I did the normal abs and came home. 

I didnt watch american idol tonight or any tv for that matter. i dont know why i really just wasnt interested. but I will be ready for o.c. tomorrow. yes the show is getting a little bit out of control. but i just keep reminding myself that i dont live in newport beach, i dont live in cali period and I dont own a $5000 chanel bag. although i wish i did. chanel is my heart. i loveee chanel. And no I dont own anything chanel. I want to change that. I think its bc we dont have a chanel nearby except for north jersey. I know im not allowed to buy their clothes since im ""still growing"" but it doesnt mean i cant get a little bag or some of their jewelry. :) 

Today was also awesome because i had some wonderful conversations once again. I LOVE you guys. Im not sure if I want a snow day or not and YES that does affect me. 

hmmmm im about 150 pages into sloppy firsts.halfway done! Awesome book, a little graphic at sometimes. I was reading it aloud to my dad and it was funny. I have him addicted. I leave friday for Tampa so no hebrew high for two weeks! I come home wednesday. Oh i wont be there to give sless an article. Darn. 

Speaking of this tournament. I need to do well. Now that its the point system I have to. Since i wont have any tournaments, besides my one for revenge against the scratcher, in march. 

I had an awesome weekend last weekend. I havent had one of those out three nights straight till one every morning for a long time. And trust me im paying for it now. I didnt get any sleep this weekend and i am exhausted. I wish my entries were as good as jessica darlings. Man imagine if i had a journal like that or nearly as funny. 

oh and just incase for some odd reason someone gets tennis magazine. ill be featured in there in an add for my school. wooo hooo. it will be little, but my pic and all! im excited. it also looks like this will be a great month. I am booked for the next two fri and sat's with wonderful events. We'll see if it all happens. Especially since someone's not good at 'sticking to plans.' hmmmmm. 

ok im out. later.

"event","I was just reading some sloppy firsts and I always get tired when I read but before I go to bed I have to write about the last two days before I forget. 

Friday- Woke up blah blah blah and then went to the mall with my dad. Had lunch, some of his students came up to say hello, got my mom some little presents (victorias secret, bath and body works, etc.), and then bought my shoes. I picked up some black strappy shoes at charlotte russe for $18..what a deal i thought...story comes later. Oh and my dad bought me sloppy firsts and the lucky shopping manual. I wasnt allowed to have them until today though since they were part of my v-day present. Then on the way home we went to sugar pine. Then came home at like 2:30 and took the cover off our car and started it up to take it around the corner. I freakin got to drive! omg it was amazing. even better than my moms car. so we let that run for a little and then my dad dropped me over at john roberts. I had a new guy do my hair and im in love. He cut off about a inch and a half and blow dryed it straight. Came home and got dressed and ready and everything and drove the car over to pick up my brother and then to borgata. We were sitting in front of the ocean club (for my brother) and two spanish guys pulled up next to us and were like 'sorry to trouble you but would you be interested in selling your car' my dad said no and just like put the window up and turned away. It was funny. We were scared they were going to like follow us. We get to the party and it was awesome. I wanted to cry when everyone was standing and applauding for my mommy. We knew the band because of my dad so that was fun to talk to them. Um not much more happened worth mentioning. Then we left and by that time every step i took was torture. I have never been in so much pain from shoes. It wasnt that they like 5 inches tall it was the part where your toes bend and omg one word...PAIN. came home and went to bed. 

Saturday- woke up and stayed in my pajamas till like 11:30. niceee. then i did some schoolwork and then my dad and i decided to get a brick oven pizza from this new place. it took a freaking hour and a half to get a pizza. it was ridiculous. although it was pretty good in the end. came home, did schoolwork and just hung out till about 5 when my family came home and we did the gift thing. I got chocolates, my books, and flowers. <333 perfect gifts. then i got dressed and ready and my brother and i went to his place so he could change and then we decided to go to the new japanese place near the shore mall, ginza, since we figured they wouldnt be mobbed. they were really busy but we walked in with no reservation and were able to sit at the sushi bar. it was the best sushi i have ever had. I had THREE phila rolls AND this dinner entree with salmon sashimi and white rice although it was served in what i thought was doggie bowl. I started barking and joking with my brother.funny stuff. plus soup and salad. yummm. i was stuffed. and then the waitress gave me a red rose. so it was really nice and the food was awesome. Then we headed up to the movie theatre and almost got in an accident because of the stops in the middle barrier where you can make u-turns. the guy in front of us was kissing the butt of the guy in front of him when he decides to make a left turn WITHOUT a signal so the guy tailing breaks and then we break. luckily my brother is a good driver and that theres good breaks on the mercedes. phew. close one there..the food in my stomach wasnt happy about that one. then we got to the movie theatre safely. we saw along came polly which i was dying to see and it was histerical. soooo good. i love jennifer aniston. ""i sharted"" haha sooo then i drove home. 

i had an absolutely wonderful evening. i couldnt have spent it with any better of a guy than my brother. we were cracking up on the way home from the movie. omg i thought i was going to die. 

i also get to go with him tomorrow night to the concert. i still dont know what im wearing but i love my hair so thats a plus. i still havent played tennis or exercised so thats a negative. i have three assignments to go on my sat prep and i have until tomorrow night. i really dont care at this point. it will just be good to get it over with. 

i got a valentines day card from texas a & m. they send me cards for every little holiday there is. i love it. i feel so special lol. and i got more stuff from yale :) they want me to email them my tournament schedule for the year so that they can come watch me play some more. yipeee. that might very well be where i will go. 

oh and one more thing..my dad got a valentine in the press today. it said hey senor, are you ok?? xoxoxox your secret admirer. luckily he knows who it is. i always want to do those newspaper greetings but always forget. man.

<marquee> HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY </marquee>

"event","ok so today was pretty good. its a wednesday so that means my moms day off and our day together. i have to make this fast because the o.c. is on in ten minutes!!! well woke up and had to straighten my room because the house cleaners were coming..i dont think it makes sense...i have to clean in order for someone else to clean!!?? then my mom was in a bad mood and yelled at my dad and i and then i finally got her out of the house and we went to knit wit and jules in margate and then to central square to rissy roos and then to sandra and roys and then to cheeseboard. my mom bought a dress for her awards dinner and has now decided shes not going to wear it and that she hates it. long story. i also found a dress..gorgeous..a strapless pink with big sequins all over it and a bow across the center..absolutely gorgeous..but it was 300 and the sequins were starting to fall off and we werent going to spend that much for one night. then we had to go because i had mrs. spiker at 1:15...fun. then i went with mom shopping for shoes..im still not even sure why we went but we did and i got four new pairs..a pair of like black boots/heels i dont know what they are called..a white pair of that kind of shoe for summer..THE WHITE KITTEN HEEL SANDALS..omg im in love..and then a pair of sandals with a black and white polk-a-dot bow..adorable. :) so then my mom wanted to get me the dress and i was like noooo i want more clothes instead..so im glad i did that so now i think ill actually be able to get some more... more :)  thennnn

we went and got our nails done. since i didnt have a dress by then i needed to get like a neutral color.sooooo i ended up with silver. but its not really silver its like glitter..its really partyish like it will look good for fri but as for tomorrow and there after its a little wild. but oh well i like things different. then we came home and had dinner. thennn i tried on my moms dress since shes not going to wear it but it was a little too big and not my color..lol. sooo my brother came up with the idea of me wearing my 'britney spears' outfit. which is the dress from the evening party at my bat mitzvah. it has a black halter top with an open back other than a tie in the center and the front of the top comes down to a point like a handkerchief..and at the v of the handkerchief it has a v of diamonds. and then the bottom is just a black long skirt..its like a light fabric almost like silk. pretty and i am soooo surprised i can still fit into the thing..the only other time i wore it was to homecoming at a.c. freshman year. so yea i guess my nails go and everything should be a-ok. now i just need shoesssss. 

then i went to the gym at like 8 tonight and ran and did some abs. i was so proud of myself last night because at like 11:45 before bed i made myself do 100 crunches and some side crunches. although right now i dont know what my reasoning was and why i did them. i thought it was because i didnt have exercise but i did..soo who knows. but then i came home from the gym tonight and watched the o.c.!!!!! best episode yet by far. i dont know what it is. its almost like lj. something i know i could live without and it feels like a stupid obsession yet i dont think at this point its something i could live without. craaaazy. im drinking some tea and about to go in the shower after this. and then to bed..ugh im so tired. 

tomorrow will consist of a lot of sat prep work considering the fact that my teacher has decided to be a complete a-- and end my course!!?? i dont know what his problem is. how can he hate me??? is that possible??? so hes giving me till sunday night and other than that ill have a freaking 82!! ive never gotten a c in my life. all i have left is 10 assignments. i dont understand!?? im just going to guess on them all and finish them some how. what great sat prep this is. gosh. 

then friday i have a hair appointment at four and the event starts at 5:30. yay. then saturday im hoping my valentines day consists of more than dinner with my parents. i hate to say it but yes i want a bf too. it seems like im being stupid and missing out on something. i dont know..if its meant to be, its meant to be. :/

so yea if any friends out there reading this are lonely as well on v-day and wanna do something...anything..let me know. thennn sunday ill be at the concert with my brother..as my date. i have to get something to wear. yipeee. excuse for something new. oh and my brother and his crackhead (what my other bro calls her..the gf.fiance.x-fiance) will also be there..but they bought their tiks seperately so they wont be next to us. phew. 

so all in all except for another lonely v-day it should be an awesome, exciting weekend. why is everyone going away!!?? ugh. the one weekend i dont. haha. 

things are great. i think i just have to except the fact that i chose private school, well private school online and i wont be going to prom. :'( :'( :'( oh well there is always next year.

i hope everyone has an awesome four day weekend and a very happy, loving valentines day with their sweeties or on vaction or whatever everyone else is doing. :)

"event","ok where do i begin!!?? lets try the beginning.

i woke up at like 8 or so..jumped in the shower bc i couldnt wake up for anything. its becoming a habit now. honestly i dont know how anyone wakes up at 5:45 in the morning. i remember 'when i was in school' i would set my alarm for 5:45 but then i would sleep till like 6:30 EVERY morning. ugh it was horrible. soooo anyway now im starting to take morning showers so i actually do wake up. then i drove my dad over to starbucks and there is this man at the margate starbucks who cannot speak english..for his life! everytime i go in there i get him and its horrible. everytime he asks me something i just look at him and he has to repeat it ATLEAST one time. i feel so bad but its not my fault i just cant understand the man. well today he asked me like 5 questions on my drinks and it was just sad. it took like 20 min to get two drink orders. ugh. so then we went to hanna g's to place a take-out order for my dad and went next door to look at some fur coats my mom had seen that she likes. i tried them on and we decided on one. we are going back tomorrow to get her one for valentines day/platinum award. i just keep thinking that eventually i will be wearing them. lol well then we got his order and came home. 

then i cleaned my room up a little and then went outside and played some tennis with my dad. it was my first day back in like a week. i didnt play that well but we were only out there for like 45 mins. im preparing for my big challenge match somtime this week. haha. then we came home..my parents went out and i walked over to the gym. man was it gorgeous out. i had an awesome workout. i was running up to like 7.5 on the treadmill for like 25 minutes. then i did my ab work. my dad also joined me in the middle of my workout so it was fun running with him and basically racing him. then we left and went to jakielsky's chocolates. picked up my moms valentines gifts for her clients. everything there looks to die for. then we delivered the gifts to my mom and stopped for lunch at wawa. came home.

then i came home and went in the shower. from there i just hung around the house till dinner. i think i did some schoolwork today. not much. then went to hebrew high...and it was well..hebrew high. 

im sure none of you will see this in time but i will be at mrs. spikers tomorrow at 1:15. atleast i know ill get a hello from mitch. :) i think thats the closest i get to being in school. i have actually made somewhat of a decision of what i want to do next year. it all depends on how well i do this year and how much i get my ranking up in the 18's. basically now that i am 35 in the country that will help me tremendously get the school i want. if i ever decide what school. thats a whole other story. sooo...if i do well enough where it wont be important to be in a private school and travel every weekend then i will be in a high school. and im not even sure if it would be mainland or a.c. i have a lot better feel about my future than i did last year. if i had to guess i would say i will be at mainland next year. just a guess. 

tomorrows my day with my mom. we will be going to the gym and swimming and getting shoes and dresses for the big event. also getting our nails done. i will be counting down the hours once again till the o.c. its been toooo long. ahh i cant wait.

oh and as for some updates. my brother will be my date at this awards dinner(jk). i dont think it will matter that much not bringing someone this year. we reserved a table of 10 and my other brother and his fiance/ex-fiance/girlfriend (who knows anymore) are coming although they didnt think they could make it so now my brother and i cant bring dates unless we want to get another table. which we cant. so our table consists of me, two brothers, parents, aby (my older bros girl), then my moms team manager and her husband and then another employee and his girlfriend/fiance as of the day after the event...should be fun. im just excited to get my hair cut on friday and i love getting all dressed up. 

this weekend should be awesome. might have a challenge match on thursday evening. friday is the big day. saturday is valentines day and i dont care if i have a valentine or not..it will still be great. im hoping to go out that night though and being valentines it might mess things up. uh oh. then sunday i should be at the concert. :) :) :)

ummm not sure if theres anything else to update you guys on. i know i had more to say but it will have to wait till tomorrow.

goodnight all <3"

"event","well ive had a wonderful last couple of days. my weekend was great so that equals another long entry that i know all of you love so since i havent updated lately... for your convenience....

<lj-cut>ummm lets see. i believe it was saturday night when i went up to cherry hill for my grandmoms birthday. shes now 86 or 87 or somewhere around there and she is sharper than a knife. unbelievable. my family and i can never remember how long my parents have been married and we knew it was either 6 or 7 and she knows for sure that it will be 7. she can tell you every single birthday of every relative. even mine. she even knows the name of our city and everything about our lives..stuff we've told her 5 years ago. shes amazing. my grandfather though has alzheimer's and he gets confused quite frequently. sometimes he'll surprises us. my grandparents are histerical..my grandmom yells at my grandfather constantly...everyone teases how she thinks shes perfect. she has 'her' chair at my aunts and shes a veryyyy big drinker..she has to have her wine everynight. shes histerical but amazing. my grandparents are having their 60th anniversary down at their home in florida in march. i dont think ill be there because of that huge tournament i was talking about that i must win. and it will probably be the last time the 7 out of 8 living brothers and sisters will be together. and will probably be an awesome party. anyway..saturday night was awesome. i had more fun then when i go out with friends sometimes on the weekend. incredible. it was my family and i, my grandparents, my two aunts and their families that came to see me play, my one aunts best friend, one of my cousins sean that is a year older than me and all the other kids. the other half of the family couldnt make it. so it was small and nice. i was the highlight of the party when i picked up my tall, slim but muscular 200lb uncle and then i picked up my aunts best friends husband who is a little chubby 220lbs. it was histerical and i had to do it like 5 times bc was aunt was trying to take a picture. she finally got one of him in mid-air. dont worry, when i get that i will def be posting it. hahaha fun times. i also had amazing dessert. warmed brownies with ice cream. mmmmm. soo good. 

then i came home and talked online till like one in the morning. i had a special convo with one person who continues to infuriate me. a person that means so much to me and happens to be or atleast i thought was one of my closest friends. ugh. i could go on but ill stop here. i think and i HOPE it is all in my head. i hope i find out soon bc it is absolutely killing me. ahh. ok. 

then yesterday, sunday, i woke up at 10 and went into my moms office at 11. supposedly sundays are now my day to be in my moms work since her team office manager has off sundays. right now my mom only has 3 or 4 people working for her on her team and would get more but she already has no room in her office which is already the biggest room in the place. i cant wait for the new prudential that is being built up southside. it should be done in 8 or 9 months. my mom will have room for a team of about 11 and her office will have ocean views. how cool. and i probably wont have to go in there anymore since there will be a larger staff. awesome and so exciting. im STILL very proud of her. speaking of that. her awards dinner would be this friday. do i have a date? noooo. do i have a dress? noooo. what is wrong with me. ah child. stupido..thats what i say. ill be looking foward to that when i am prepared.

then today i woke up and did some more sat prep work. then i left with my dad to go on a little ride. we drove all the way up to cherry hill once again. first to get a peter ban cake. you have never had cake until you have had a peter ban birthday cake from peter ban bakery in moorestown. it is..is...orgasmic. excuse me but it is. we also got a dozen of their cookies. their stuff is just heavenly. then we ate at the moorestown deli. also another great place. then we went to my aunts again where my grandparents are staying for the month before they go back down to florida. they come up and stay there a lot. we went and wished my grandmom a happy birthday since today is her official birthday. oh and today is also my uncles birthday..i forgot to mention the party was also for him. so we took his present up. we stayed there for about an hour talking and then we left. then my dad picked up some paperwork at the doctors and then we stopped at the mall once again and finally returned the phones. then we stopped at borders. WHY THE HELL ISNT THERE A BARNES AND NOBLE!!?? BORDERS SUCKS. i finally went to get sloppy firsts and second helpings after the third person told me about it. i also wanted to get the lucky guide to shopping or whatever it is from lucky mag. but no luck either. borders said on the computer that it had five copies left and searched for like an hour but couldnt find them. stupid place. so i left empty handed. then we went over to another musicians house in galloway so my dad could pick up a file. then i got to drive home. it was the most fun i have had yet. i convinced my dad to let me blast my music..well not blast but loudly play MY music since I was the driver. that was what my parents ALWAYS said to me when i was younger. 'you will get to choose the music when your the driver' yesss haha suckers. my turn. we were joking and laughing and having fun the entire way home. then went to casels and picked up bagels and lox for dinner..yummmmy. excellent day as food goes. then i came home to people mag and jcrew catalogue and some other magazines and read them for about an hour. i also got a letter from a florida college. i think u of south florida in tampa. just so happens im going to tampa next weekend. lol. 

this weekend should be busy and funnnn. friday night is my moms award dinner..as long as i can find a date or someone to tag along it will be awesome. then saturday..besides being valentines day and one of my favorite holidays i will def be doing something that night. hopefully. then on sunday..strange..im going to the enrique concert i think with my brother. excited? yes i am. 

ive basically forgotten about all my problems and crisis's right now. ive decided to ignore them. and i also figured out why i was such a bitch and acting so dramatically. it was one of my girl times that i couldnt control and it turned out to be my time (of the month) that i get like that. so im glad im not depressed anymore and im over all that. lol lifes back to being good.

i did although write an anti-boy entry i think on saturday night at like 12am encouraged by the same person i will continue to complain about. once again i deleted it. it was maybe one or two sentences but my late night entries on anything but my day are crazy and harsh. it was out of anger. ughh once again. 

now that i am back to my good ol' happy self my main problem will yet again be the dreaded p word....duh duh duhhhh...prom. ugh it makes me sad to think about. the last week i had like 10 friends, elders, friends of family ask me which one im going to and what ill do about it and i just wanna break out crying. ahh. stupid online schooling.

there is so much going on in the next two months. its going to be a very busy rest of feb and march. i like busy.

im also very mad i missed the sale at smith bros over the weekend. buy one get one 1/2 off. the only reason i was pushing to get my mom up there was bc its already hard enough to get her to buy me clothes since she for some odd reason thinks  i already have too many. so if i find a sale that she can go to as well as me than my chances are usually great and i can squeeze some clothes out of her but oh well. ill get her soon enough. ohh maybe in florida! ugh i love clothes too much.

ok time for dinner. otherwise i would continue to entertain everyone.</lj-cut>

tonights my big fat obnoxious finance and it begins the wonderful week of awesome tv. and i am sweating it out till wednesday for the o.c.

question..should i stay up past midnight to download norah jones album. if it comes out tomorrow shouldnt it be on there at like 12:30 or so...ahh i cant wait and i will def get it tomorrow. sunriseeeeeeeeee sunrise looks like morning in your eyes but the clocks had nine fifteen for hoursssssssss omg i love that song. 


laterrr 

omg! i forgot to ask if a certain belkin could lend me sloppy firsts until i can find it at a book store. maybe bring it to hebrew high?? and if you need some motivation..im still waiting to get over to sandra and roys for your charm ;)

thank youuuuuuuuuu <3"

"event","my day wasnt that great. i woke up in lousy mood. due to the fact that i had a horrible night last night. i typed an entry late last night about how badly i wanted to cry but i deleted it this morning because it was a little to much and i didnt want to be in a bad mood. i just couldnt help it. then when i woke up this morning i turned on my computer and got even worse news...now that i lost this tournament last weekend i dropped from 4 in G18 middle states to number 7...yes i said 7. i havent been out of the top 5 in middle states rankings for over a year now. this is disastrous. i havent even told my parents yet. im just devastated. i seriously could ruin my year. if i dont win the sre on march 26th then i might not be high enough in the rankings to go to fed cup. i HAVE TO GO TO FED CUP. i was there last year but i wasnt able to talk to the coaches. this year will be my oppurtunity with EVERY single college coach there. im sure middle states will want me there but i dont know...theres noooo way ill be invited if im freaking number 7. gosh. sooo march 26th i am winning that f'in tournament. im going to train my ass off. ughhhh its mine. soo mine. and even if i was to get on the team and go i will probably have to be there with the 'scratcher' and she is just going to RUIN the entire event for me. ahhh! it would horrible. i just wouldnt go if she was placed higher on the team than me. that would be a disgrace. she isnt even good. so thats the sad part. shes 5 in g16's and shes older than me. now that she did well in this tournament she is 4 in g18s. which was MY spot. :'( omg im sooo furious. that girl better watch out bc im honestly going to hurt her if she comes anywhere near me. you people have no idea. some of you find it amusing....hmm hmm....NO! shes dead. i better make that team and i better be within the top 3. now i have to get my 18s ranking higher...much higher in order to do so. i already missed out on this tournament this week. i want it more than ever right now. those girls better watch out on the 21st in tampa. bc i will be kicking some butt. major butt. 

on a lighter note. i woke up and then had a bagel and then did some schoolwork. and then my mom called me into her office to do some flyers around 11 or so. juan picked me up and then we went over to hot bagels and then to the office. hes such a cool guy. hes finally proposing to his g/f on valentines day. anyway i just really didnt get anything done there..when i did get lunch for the team i bought my mom a pepsi and won a free song from itunes...that made my day..lol. i scanned my pictures for my teacher and sent him a consent letter. my school wants to use me for their new advertising brochure and stuff. sooo cool. oh and im also no longer one in middle states for g16s. some of my tournaments dropped off from last year but i guess it really doesnt matter since ive moved up now. im very excited for the awards banquet on the 6th. ive always dreamed of going. so then i came home from the office.

i went out with my dad in the terrential rain and drove him to greenhouse and then the movie store and wawa. i renter radio. man what an amazing movie. it is now officially one of my all-time favorites. i just love true inspirational stories for some reason. how can you not? like that door to door one i saw. i dont know. so it was another wonderful night spent at home with my family. i think im going to just explode if i dont go out more often. thats another whole long story. i hate myself when it comes to that. blahhh. anyway im going out for breakfast with my mom tomorrow morning and then i dont know what ill be doing. im definitely going out tomorrow night so ill be waiting for that. the weekends here and im not in a good mood. something is wrong with that. 

im down to 14 assignments on sat prep. i have one more day. yipee. wont be done but im sure my teacher will give me another extension. i dont know why hes being so strict about it when my teachers last year gave me like an extra month or two to finish my courses. oh well. one of the quotes in the movie was that the coach learned to keep his priorities straight and then to push everything else aside. i think my number one priority right now is myself and my happiness. what i want to do. im blessed to be able to do what im doing and i want to enjoy it. forget schoolwork right now. i know ill get it done. eventually. like i always do.

this is definitely a weird entry. maybe im just going insane tonight from being in the house too much. its only my fault though. 

im sure tomorrow will be a great day. im going to make it one no matter what. usually after these horrible 'everythings wrong' times..things start to go great. i hope it starts tomorrow. i wish i knew what im doing is right. i wish i could know that im making the right decisions. i wish i knew something! but i dont. im clueless. life is so funny. and people are histerical. computers make things even harder. im a very sensitive person and IM's kill me. and people are lying when they say it doesnt bother them when friends dont answer IM's or due to this whole online thing a friend seems mean or something. i hate talking online. ive said it a million times. jon you know what i mean. ;) 

alright i dont know what i just mumbled about. i was just cheered up majorlyyyy by an old friend. its strange how it seems like people are placed in your lives just for that reason..to be there at those strange times. and ha its 11:45..almost tomorrow. i knew tomorrow would be a great day. :)

i loveee long entries for some reason. they make me feel awesome to just spill my entire heart out..and it just so happens everyones reading. and you know what..it feels great to care less what you guys think of this. yes i get in bad/sad moods all the time. but oh well what am i gonna do? thats me and if you hate the complaining then dont read. its as simple as that. 

ahh this really is a freeing experience. i am nuts tonight. i MUST go to bed.

that was fun.

muahhhh

"event","today was quite an interesting day. woke up at 7:30, then 8 and then 8:30. got up and brushed my teeth and thennnn..surprise surprise went back to bed until like 9 or 9:30. i dont know what was wrong with me and i went to bed at like 11:30 last night, which is kinda early for me. when i finally did get up i hung around the house for a little and then had a chocolate peanut butter slim-fast breakfast bar..i live on those things..amazing. the cookie dough one is the shiznit. i eat them constantly at tournaments before, in between, and after matches. after that my dad came home from somewhere and that part of the day is little vague..i think i started on some schoolwork but didnt really get anything done. im at a road block right now. im actally working on my sat course right now..im in the middle of learning 50 new words on this computer program. then something happened or i was having a convo with my dad and somehow i got myself into cleaning and re-doing my moms closet. i think the keyword there was..ipod. so i started on that project. which i dont mind doing..i love doing organizing and being creative with stuff of that nature. so i was working on that for a couple hours and then i went into my moms office for about 30 min to fix her printers. then went to casels. then worked on her closet some more and then went in the shower. today was my day to deeeeep condition my hair..it is my favorite day of the month. once a month since my hair is soo ridiculously damaged from tennis. oh well. then i had dinner..tuna melts <3. now im here studying and trying to get some work done and then in 15 minutes starts the best night of tv. for me its..friends, will and grace and apprentice. 

other than my day i had some things to mention but i forget them once again. whats new.

"event","i am sooooooo mad right now that there isnt any kind of an o.c. on tonight. i feel deprived. :'( ok real fast bc im in the middle of some great convo's. today i woke up and got yelled at by my mom bc she woke up in a bad mood. then my parents went out to hannah g's and i ate bowl of ants. hmmmmm...let me back up..i poured a bowl of cereal..continued to eat MOST of it..got to the end and looked down to see a hundred ants swimming around. i started flippppping out! but then i thought if people on fear factor can eat cow brains and stuff then i can eat a couple ants. great reasoning right? haaaa. so i felt like i had mini legs swimming in my throat for a couple of hours. disgusting. thennnnnn i dont a pre-calc assignment w/o mrs spiker! and then i helped my parents clean out our coat closet. ive never seen a family with so many coats not worn. it was ridiculous. so now we narrowed it down and its alllllllllll good. then i drove my mom in HER car to first drop clothes at the cleaners and then to kensington. when i grow up..i will have a fast car. there is nothing better than a fast car. i was kickin it and it was amazing. my moms like sloowwwwwwwwwwww down..im like..hmmm NO. it was funny. then were at kensington and besides the fact that i ate 20 chocolate chip cookies we found a new couch we like and we bought a new area rug for under our dining room table. the salvation army picked up our couches yesterday so it was an incentive to get my mom to finally start re-doing our house. two years ago we bought our house exactly how it was..move-in condition and it had only been used twice since it was built a couple years prior to that. soooo now we are starting to decorate. and then were moving. lol. funnnn. then we came home and we moved our freakin dining room table which weighs 500000 tons. that was an experience. i guess this entry isnt going to be fast. soooo then i got changed and went to yama for sushi with my brother. it was soooo good. anytime anyone wants to go for sushi..call me! im in love with phila rolls. amazing. so then we stopped at wawa so we could get ice cream. i dont know what came over me...i wanted some soo badly. so my brother and i got this new peanut butter cup ice cream. its so not like me to pig out sooo much in one day..but i did. haha janey or jon if your reading, i know you'll be proud of me.  so we came home and watched american idol. i love that show so much. i cant wait till it gets down to like 8 or so. now im here and im getting ready to go shower. i need to go shopping for a dresssss. ugh. when do i have time!? theres a lot i need to do. i hope i have a good weekend. im in need of some fun right now. alright the shower is calling me.

"event","Im going to warn you that there is a very long entry on the way.

First off to update all of you on my tournament...I LOST. I finished 4th. yes 4th. and yes i was seeded one. i totally dont want to talk about it. i couldnt be any more disappointed then i am right now. i lost both my matches yesterday. first to jackie herb, the scratcher. she is the psycho...NOT ME! ughhhhhhh i wanna yell so loud. but i know i have to get over it and figure out a way to stop letting these kinds of tricks get to me. i had like 20 fans there and they are all writing letters to complain about her. she cursed out my family, cursed out me, cursed out my little cousins and gave them the finger...unreal! aghhh!

then in my second match i went out there sooooo sad/mad/confused/every negative emotion possible because all of my family and friends left because they saw i was upset and couldnt stand the b-tch that did it to me. so i was mad about that and i just wanted to cry bc it meant so much to me that they were there and then i ruined it. plus i was mad that i lost and that the finals were being played on the court next to me and i know if i would have gotten past 'the scratcher' i would have won the whole tournament. ugh. so i lost my second match like 6-4,7-6(5). in the second set i was down 5-3 (40-15) came back and then i dont know what happened..also came back from 6-2 in the tiebreaker. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 

anyway

i know i should being doing college stuff right now to prepare but im just already overloaded. how the hell do i know where i wanna go. i cant even decide where i wanna go on a friday night with friends. i am not going to be able to make such a big decision. but i def need to start answering these coaches at the least. 

my family just sent me flowers..omg. i love them. 

i need to be done 16 sat prep assignments by sunday...i was supposed to be done the course yesterday but i have an extra week. dont think ill get it done though. i wanna try to do 4 assignments a day and get it done in like 4 days but thats going to be really hard. ill finish somehow. 

last night was absolutely ridiculous. i was soo depressed from losing plus i had killer pains in my stomach so i was in the worst moood EVER. i came online and received some cheering up from the greatest people but then my parents made me get off my computer bc i was acting like such a b-tch. lol its funny to think about now. i was in so much pain and i just felt like my family just cared about themselves. ugh. i was stupid. so i went to bed at i dont even know what time. i think it was like halftime in the game and somehow i fell asleep with the pain and i woke up at 12am and had EVEN worse pain so i got up to search the entire house for tylenol..but no luck...all there was was advil..i didnt want advil though, i needed tylenol. so i woke my dad up and he gave me tylenol and stayed in my room till i fell back asleep. he talked to me and made me feel sooo much better. worlds number one dad. i def didnt watch any of the super bowl and i missed all the commercials and especially janet jacksons boob. although i heard my mom yell something about it to my dad.

i usually dont like people who are always sad and in bad moods and upset with their lives so i do always try to be in a good mood, i mean last night was an exception..i def had the right to be in a bad mood. but ive been getting sad and in bad moods more and more lately and i dont like it. so im going to try to work on that one.

my parents are telling me to pull out of my tournament in chicago this weekend for a couple reasons...since im not feeling well, my brother would have to take me, im at a low right now after losing, and its just plain going to be cold. lol i guess i will although for some reason i just really dont want to. i guess it will be best thing to do. 

my mom has her awards dinner on the 13th. she will once again be the star. im so proud of my mommy. i guess it was about a year ago that we decided we would both get into the top 100 with our rankings in the country. me with tennis and her with real estate. so she did hers and was ranked the 98th realtor in the country last year out of 47,000+ prudential agents and i was 102....now im 35 so we were joking how she has to catch up to me..it will be histerical if she beats me this year! so anyway i have to get a dress and a date for this little shindig. should be fun. it was ok last year..danced, had fun..my brother and his then fiance were sooooo drunk. and they were walking around ceasars with my other brother and almost missed my mom getting her award. omg it was funny. this year its at the borgata. yipee.

there are a lot of family parties coming up. my grandmoms bday is on the 9th so were going up to cherry hill to my aunts house to celebrate. ill be able to go now that im not going to this tournament. :) always a good time. 

by the way, when i refer to my family....i guess i mean my step-family. but that is such an ugly word. i refer to jeff as my dad and if i ever do talk about my real dad i will say 'my real dad'. its very complicated. i dont really talk to or see anyone from my 'real dads' family except for him and i really dont want to. thats a whole different story that very few people know about. you dont wanna know.

i just had to fax this paper in to my section for tennis so they can consider me for tennis training with the u.s.t.a. my dad just filled it out and it said how much money my parents spent on my tennis last year and honestly i had no idea it was this much. i thought maybe 40 or 50 thousand but not twice that. im in shock and WOW you wanna talk about pressure? my mom keeps telling me that its just money they would have to be spending on my college but okay whatever you say. my parents are just amazing. my mom and my dad are incredible people. i cant believe the way i treat them sometimes..including last night. i feel so ashamed..after finding this out i dont think ill ever be able to be mean to them again...haha lets see how long this lasts. 

i def made a note of what i wanted to write so i didnt forget..wow..what a loser...but it helped.

im not sure if i mentioned this before or not but i had made a list of purchases i wanted to make. and i got in a fight with my mom and she ripped it up..well my brother kept the list (i was amazed..he is the best as well) and now i have it in front of me...

-my fur momma uggs
-ipod
-dido cd
-pants hangers...LOL!
-rabbi daughters tee
-a pink leather band for the diamond d i got last valentines day
-one of those jelly bags
-clinique hair stuff
-fruit of the loom mens tanks...the wifebeater ones..love them!
-this amazing pair of heels i saw at urban outfitters

sooooo that was my list and my mom thinks im crazzzzzzy.

i did go over it with her and she thought most of it is reasonable..i was shocked/relieved to hear that.

hmmmm..lets see, that means ill be able to go out this weekend so that will be funnnnn. and i wont have another tournament till feb 21st in tampa and then thats it until i think april. pretty nice break. 

oh this morning i woke up at i dont know what time, had chocolate chip banana bread for breakfast..yummmmmmmm. and then drove my dad to cvs and the hardware store. then i watched an episode of superman. im going to go grab something to eat and then i think i should do some schoolwork. oh and i just hung up all the clothes that i had piled up on my furniture. haha i get in a good mood after i clean my room...i feel so much more organized and just happy! lol laugh AT me all you want. 

i just found a picture of my old best friend kimberly zoltek in my desk drawer. i met kim when i moved to upper township. one day i like supposedly stepped on this kid et's finger and BROKE it..although im sure i didnt. and kim, this girl meghan, this kid kyle and this kid tom were like the 4 most popular kids in the grade at the time...4th grade. and she like 'sent' for me to come to her table and sit with her..so i did and we hit it off. i sat there on friend fridays everyweek bc otherwise you had to sit with your class. but we had different teachers in 4th and 5th grade so i really didnt get to know her that well. i thought i was such hot sh-t being friends with her. and then we came to 6th grade and we had alll the same classes together and we instantly became best friends..how could you not. we would talk alll day long and get in trouble in almost every class. we would pass notes and everything. we also had all the same classes in 7th and 8th as well. i loved this girl..here i had idolized her and now i was best friends with her although she was still kind of one of the popular ones yet she preferred to be in her own group. almost like the popular ones wanted her in their group. odd thing was we never hung out outside of school. one time we stayed after AT school and studied together but that was it. then when i moved to margate her and our friend kate took a cab all the way from upper to come to a jcc dance with me. it was an ok night. i talked to her for i guess a year or so after i moved back to margate. we would talk on the phone for hours till like 4 am. and then something happened...im still not sure. i have her sn and i still think everyday about how i want to IM her. she is an amazing person and she made my life so much better. i was scared for awhile that she had turned ghetto or something since the last i had heard from her was that she realllly liked this black guy. but friends that i still talk to from upper tell me she isnt and im thrilled to know that. ugh i dont know what to do. i think i got mad bc she would never IM me or call me and that i always had to be the one to initiate it yet she always said she wanted me to call or that she was glad to talk to me. i dont know. im sooo confused on that. just thought i share that little story. tons more where that came from.

alright that is <b>definitely</b> enough typing for now.

i love anyone that has read this entire thing.

later"

Overall the team played very well considering the fact that they got their butts handed to them by valley the first time they played them. The final score was 1-1. After that I had to walk to Welzel's house all the way down brockway from White Pine. It sucked. Then i went to my game at 8... and we actually won. Our first non-forefit win. It was 5-3.

SENIORS won...of course!!! we won spring fever by 5 and the overall class competition by 15. The only event i was in was hockey. As if anyone didnt know that already. The first game we played was against the sophomores... and we won 5-4, and i got the game winning goal. THe juniors had previouly beat the freshmen 7-1... so we had to play them in the championship. We only got to play two 8min periods, and that ended up in a 0-0 tie. So we had to go to a shoot-out. We ended up winning that 1-0, and I got the only goal. The thing is, is that we were a really big underdog. We werent even expected to win the first game against the sophomores. It was really cool. I was sad cuz i didnt have a cheering section. Ohh well... i'll live. but i am gonna watch a movie now... maybe it'll be boring and put me to sleep...yah right!!!

That pisses me off, grr!!! it was really funny because tara's dad was sooo pissed, he juped up and ran to the locker room. i thought he was gonna stangle the kid. ohh well... the kid would've deserved it, anyways... after that i came home and watched a really sad episode of Extreme Makeover Home Edition.

I now have 6 goals and 4 assists in four games. The loss wasn't the worst part of it. One of our better players went full speed, head first, into the boards and really hurt his neck. They think it is a compressed spine, so we'll see what happens with that. Hope he's OK!!! On to today... it was a typical day in my life. Bored at school, except for after 3rd hour... that was the exciting part of my day. Other than that school sucked yet again. I have to coach a game tonight at 6:45 for my little kids team.

The first one was to TC West 3-2 and second one was today to Lakeland 3-1. Lakeland really sucked but we just sucked more. I thought I played a pretty good tourney especially since I hurt my knee in the first period of the first game. I dont exactly know whats wrong with it, but it really hurts and I think I might go get it checked out. I think this weekend was really tough on some of the guys, especially those who were close to Mr. Marcoux (RIP). Like me. Well, i think i'm gonna go and take a shower and lay down.

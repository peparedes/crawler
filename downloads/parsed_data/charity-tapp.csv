"event","yea so last nite i was laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep when all of a sudden i was wide awake and had this overwhelming feeling that something bad was going on. so i got up and checked on my family and sat on the compuper for a while. once i got off the compuper i still couldnt sleep because i couldnt shake that feeling. finally once i did fall asleep and i had a really weird dream in which i was at a mob oriented raffle. i have no idea what that was all about."

"event","so yesterday ian,alex,bridget,nicole, steve Q, and myself all went on the trolley to downtown. good fun i'd say. we walked around horton plaza and got lost several times.then when we got food from mc donalds and ian, bridget, and steve Q left us and alex nicole and i got stuck eating where it smelled really bad.but we also got to listen to nicole tell us about how stuff around us reminded her of a bunch of different places. like greece, italy ect. after that we got amazing soda that sprayed everywhere. im in love with it.haha. later we wondered over to a fountain and played in it until we were all soaked. then we got back on the trolley to go home.and nicole left lilys jacket on the trolley. no good.ahh but we made it to nicoles and we all went swimming, in our clothes.

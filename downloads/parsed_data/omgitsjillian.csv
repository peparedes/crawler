"event","so yesterday was stephen and i's 1 year anniversary.
we went and played tennis, saw a movie, and went to dinner. i couldn't have asked for a more amazing day. i love him so incredibly much, and i can truly say i want to spend the rest of my life with him. he makes me the happiest person in the world, and just knowing he's actually with me makes me feel like the luckiest person in the world. he means the world to me, and that will never change.

i love you stephen, forever and always.

"event","today was absolute bliss.
other than the fact that stephen dropped me on my head.
i cuddled, i slept, i ate, i kissed, and i watched a super nerdy movie.
and i wouldn't have given any of it up for the world.
i love stephen johns, more than i ever thought i possibly would, or could.
he is the love of my life, and he always will be.


i love you baby,
forever and always."

"event","so yeaterday was absoutly amazing.
i went over to stephens after not seeing him for a week [and a day].
i had so much fun, i get such an amazing feeling when im with him. im the most comfortable when im in his arms. after ""hanging out"" for a while he made me an incredible dinner. he made me blackened fish, it turned out great, but a little salty. :] after dinner we ""watched some tv"" and stuff, then just sat and cuddled. i had such a great time. i love him so unbelievably much.

today, was lame.

i love you stephen :D"

"event","i dont know how much more of this i can take. 
i love stephen with all of my heart and so much more. 
but im tried of hurting him, im tired of always crying, im tired of thinking hes going to leave me the next time i see or talk to him. 
its only 2 days away until our anniversary, and its been the happiest 8 months of my life, and thats all thanks to him. but i know i've made the past month hell for him. i can't say the right thing, my actions are pretty much saying i dont care. and i dont mean to come off like that at all. im really trying to stop, but it seems like when i am trying, i just fuck things up again. i honestly just dont know what to do. the only thing i can say is ""im sorry"" and ""i love you"" and i know both are doing absoutly nothing. i really just dont know what to do, i want to be with him so fucking much, but i know im just running him away. latley i just feel that he'd be a lot happier without me."

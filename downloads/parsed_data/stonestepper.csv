Cleitus, Cassander, and Ptolemy had many duties preparing the greatest army Macedon had ever seen for the Persian invasion. It wasn&#39;t large compared to the Persian army, but the king was confident that it wouldn&#39;t need to be. Yet, each of the kings companions found the time to spend one or two hours a day with Hephaestion. Cleitus found to his amazement that the boy was almost as skilled a wrestler as any Macedonian boy his age. He had often wrestled with other boys in Athens. His father encouraging and his mother thinking it was games. With a little training, Hephaestion was fast becoming a feared opponent. Having very few chances to use a sword, it was this craft that Cleitus most worked with Hephaestion.&nbsp;Because of who the boy was, Cleitus took the time to work with Hephaestion personally. Much to the sulky discontent of the other teachers. He would sit in on every wrestling match, often offering advice and wisdom to all the boys, not just Hephaestion. He would stand behind Hephaestion and guide his hand, when holding a sword. They didn&#39;t join other groups when learning how to wield the great weapon. Cleitus taught the boy himself. By the end of the first month, Hephaestion was able to spar with considerable skill. Hephaestion confessed that he asked Alexander to help him at nights.

&quot;He makes me show him each day what you have taught me,&quot; laughed Hephaestion. &quot;When I told him how you had to stand behind me to show me proper holds, he didn&#39;t know what to say. He had forgotten his own training.&quot;

&quot;I should think so. Phillip had a sword in the boy&#39;s hand by the time he was three.&quot;

Cleitus and&nbsp;Hephaestion sat under a shade tree, drinking from water jugs. The young consort had accomplished much this day, and Cleitus was proud. He loved Alexander and had grown to love his consort as well.

&quot;Cleitus, may I ask you something?&quot; Hephaestion&#39;s voice was hesitant.

&quot;What is it, boy?&quot;

&quot;Are you always going to call me boy?&quot; Hephaestion asked grievously.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Cleitus chuckled. &quot;Is that what you wanted to ask me?&quot;

&quot;No. Cleitus?....Cleitus?&quot;

&quot;What is it, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Olympias told me that Alexander&#39;s father betrayed you and she both. I&#39;ve heard stories about him. He doesn&#39;t sound like a nice man.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true, lad. He wasn&#39;t nice at times. He was a brilliant king. Alexander comes by his mental ability honestly. His mother is a shrewd woman also.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t I know it,&quot; moaned Hephaestion. He had seen Alexander and Olympias match wits often during these last few weeks. &quot;Were you jealous of Olympias, Cleitus. I mean it must have been hard for you.&quot;

&quot;I felt sorry for her, Hephaestion. Even as I loved her husband, I pitied her,&quot; declared the general. &quot;Are you worried about Alexander taking a wife, lad. You know he must marry a woman.&nbsp;A&nbsp;king needs sons.&quot;

&quot;I know. And I guess it bothers me a little. Do you think he&#39;ll love her, Cleitus?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you should really ask Alexander these questions,&quot; Cleitus uttered, a little taken back by Hephaestion&#39;s guileless.

&quot;I try. He tells me not to worry about it.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a hard one to love, that&#39;s for sure. Alright, boy. I&#39;ll tell you what I think.&quot; Cleitus knew he had been manipulated. The boy would be good in diplomacy. &quot;I hope he loves her a little bit, to be honest. For her sake, as well as his. He will need to have some affection for the mother of his sons. You don&#39;t wish for the kids to grow up in a house of hatred do you?&quot;

Hephaestion hung his head. He felt guilty. He had not thought of the children. Of course he wanted his lovers sons and daughters to be happy. He also felt saddened. He would lose a big part of Alexander the day he married.

&quot;Hephaestion, there will be a fondness. I hope. But no woman could take the place&nbsp;of what he feels for you. You&#39;re everything to him. You will have to be strong to love him, my boy. His is a perilous journey. He&#39;ll need you by his side.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s where I&#39;ll always be, Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;You know, son, Alexander might want you to take a wife as well.&quot;

&quot;He mentioned as much. He wants for me to have children, and yet he does not want me to bed anybody else. Which is just as well. Cleitus, the thought of bedding a woman is very scary,&quot; Hephaestion shuddered.

Cleitus laughed. 

&quot;What did I say?&quot; asked an affronted Hephaestion.

Cleitus laughed harder.

Ignoring his friends humor, Hephaestion continued.

&quot;Cleitus, did you ever ask Phillip not to sleep with other boys?&quot;

Ah, Cleitus thought. The crux of the problem. &quot;Yes lad, I asked him.&quot;

&quot;He said no too, didn&#39;t he?&quot;

Cleitus gave Hephaestion an odd look. &quot;He didn&#39;t say no. He agreed to be faithful. It hurt all the more, knowing he lied to me. As I grew older, I learned to control the pain.&quot;

&quot;But you were never truly happy, were you?&quot;

&quot;No, son. No, I wasn&#39;t,&quot; Cleitus pondered. &quot;Hephaestion, did you ask for Alexander to be faithful to you?&quot;

&quot;I asked him for that promise. He said no,&quot; the boy&nbsp;answered forlornly.

Cleitus sighed. The child was so in love, so unprepared for certain hardships. He still saw life as a wondrous thing to be thrilled with. Cleitus doubted he would ever lose that magical notion.

&quot;Hephaestion, you do know that Alexander will always love you, and be loyal to you.&quot;

&quot;I know. I just wish he wouldn&#39;t bed anybody else. I hate the thought of anybody else touching him. And I don&#39;t want him touching any other boy the way he touches me.&quot;

&quot;He wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, do you remember when we met? You were sneaking out even then. Do you remember when you snuck back down to the hall after being told to go to bed?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I remember. Alexander was fucking that servant,&quot; Hephaestion said snidely.

&quot;Did you see any love or emotion in the coupling?&quot;

&quot;No. No I didn&#39;t. It looked meaningless, almost as if he weren&#39;t enjoying it. At that time&nbsp;I felt horrible, but now.....now I feel that it was insensate or coldblooded.&quot;

&quot;Exactly! If he ever does tumble another boy, that&#39;s how it would be again. I&#39;m positive that he would feel the disgust and the&nbsp;remorse that he did the first time around.&quot;

&quot;He felt like that?&quot;

&quot;He did. But, don&#39;t tell him I told you. A man needs some secrets,&quot; Cleitus smiled. &quot;Hephaestion, give him time. Love is hard for Alexander. He loves us all, but with you, it&#39;s all consuming. He doesn&#39;t want anybody else, lad. He doesn&#39;t even see anybody else except you.&quot;

&quot;Then why won&#39;t he promise?&quot;

&quot;He <em>might</em> slip. He&#39;ll feel terribly afterwards. He won&#39;t hurt you with a promise, like his father did to me and to his mother and to Zeus knows how many others. I don&#39;t think he will ever want another as much as he wants you,&quot; Cleitus said quietly. &quot;So you have to decide what&#39;s more important. The promise......or the intent?&quot;

Hephaestion looked at the soldier. Everybody thought Cleitus to be a hardened man. A soldier to be feared. And he was. But he was also kind and wise. 

&quot;Thank you, Cleitus. Thank you for everything,&quot; Hephaestion whispered, as he hugged the older man.

&quot;So this is what you two do when my back is turned,&quot; said a voice from behind them. &quot;How long has this been going on?&quot;

Hephaestion jumped up. Seeing that Alexander had been joking, he ran into his lovers arms. Cleitus had the audacity to lay back and wag his eyebrows at his king.

&quot;You caught us, Alexander,&quot; teased the general.

&quot;Cleitus,&quot; Hephaestion cried. 

Both soldiers laughed.

&quot;How did you do today, beloved?&quot; Alexander asked, looking at the excitement in his boy&#39;s beautiful eyes.

&quot;Oh Alexander, I beat all three boys in my matches. And Cleitus has taught me several new holds.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I see the holds Cleitus has taught you.&quot;

&quot;Alexander!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alexander said gravely. &quot;What else did you learn?&quot;

&quot;I learned two new thrusts with my sword.&quot;

&quot;Did you now? Two new thrusts with your sword?&quot; Alexander laughed.

Hephaestion looked at his king blankly and then stomped over to his water jug. He was half tempted to throw it at both teasing men. In the end he joined in their laughter.

&quot;Seriously, Alexander,&quot; Cleitus said, &quot;Hephaestion did very well today. He&#39;ll need more training with his sword.&nbsp; We have two weeks before we leave, and we can help him on the trail But it won&#39;t be long before he&#39;ll be as good as any other page in our army.&quot;

Hephaestion basked from the pride he saw in his lovers eyes.

&quot;Ptolemy and Cassander are waiting for you at the stables, Hephaestion. They say you are going to put on a little exhibition.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I almost forgot,&quot; the boy cried. &quot;Are you going to watch, Sire?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t miss it,&quot; Alexander said, already walking towards the stables. &quot;Cleitus?&quot;

&quot;Cassander told me last night that the boy was ready to show his archery skills. I would like to see.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go then,&quot; said Hephaestion, running on ahead.

&quot;He&#39;s like a ball of energy,&quot; Cleitus observed.

&quot;You don&#39;t know the half of it,&quot; bemoaned Alexander. &quot;It takes <em>a lot</em> to tire him out.&quot;

Hephaestion looked back at the laughing men, knowing somehow that they were laughing because of him

Ptolemy, who was in charge of the light cavalry archer unit, felt that Hephaestion needed little guidance. Cassander also a general and excellent horseman in the cavalry was overjoyed with Hephaestion&#39;s skills. He already had Hephaestion demonstrate the uses for his saddle and was so enthusiastic, he&nbsp;was ordering as many as he could get from his woodworkers and leather fitters. Hephaestion, who had two, was happy to lend one of his for them to make replicas of.


There were several men standing outside the large area that Hephaestion was to perform. Word had gotten out of his skills and his enchanting beauty. Some rumors said that the boy was a gift from Zeus to his son, Alexander. Some just wanted to see the boy for themselves.

Hephaestion was a little put out to see Nearchus in the crowd. The sailor had recently returned from Athens. He brought letters from his family. From which he learned that they would be unable to visit, but were happy to hear that he was himself happy in his new life. Hephaestion had come to terms with the fact that he might not ever see his family again and would have to be happy with letters. In fact he meant to talk to Alexander about mail routes while on the trail. He knew many were concerned about their families while on a campaign that might last years.

Nearchus had also brought back Bolon. This time as his lover. The two seemed in love the few times Hephaestion had seen them. Bolon had apologized to both the king and to Hephaestion. Under Nearchus&#39;s order, Hephaestion thought. But the other boy stayed away from the kings consort, because of Alexander&#39;s order, Hephaestion suspected. He was glad that the older boy wasn&#39;t in attendance for Hephaestion&#39;s show. He was nervous enough with Alexander there.


The arena in which Hephaestion was to perform&nbsp;was just a field. On all four sides of the field, four targets had been set up at long range, and directly behind each target was another target. A vat a oil with a fire wick had been set up in a heavy stand. The ground around it had been cleared and a page was close by with water. Just in case.

Hephaestion rode bareback. No blanket. Just a headstall with slim reins. He didn&#39;t have a bit in his horse&#39;s mouth. He used a bosal hackamore. Usually used on young horses or by young riders. Hephaestion used it because he had a light hand. He used pressure points to ride and didn&#39;t want his horse getting confused by a&nbsp;steel bit.

On his back hung two quivers with four arrows each. Four of the arrows had been dipped in oil. There were eight targets. If he missed one, he wouldn&#39;t try again. Also on his arm was a Scythian short bow. 46inches strung. The Athenians had many meetings with Persians over the years. Either in peace talks or war. At one such meeting Hephaestion&#39;s father purchased two bows for his son, who loved to play with his friends.&nbsp; 

While Hephaestion walked Aurum around the field, Ptolemy and Cassander went to check on a couple things, leaving Alexander with Cleitus.

Alexander stood watching his lover&#39;s every move. He was&nbsp;enamored by his boy&#39;s&nbsp;skill and ability.&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s hair was glistening in the sun, and his bronze skin glowed from his golden tan and youthful vitality. The boy had stripped to his loin cloth and his long toned legs gripped Aurum&#39;s sides. It was not only Alexander who was captivated. 

&quot;Are you glad we made the trip to Athens, my king?&quot; Cleitus asked mockingly. Alexander just smiled. &quot;I have watched you battle your fears since you were a small boy. You are fighting with yourself. What do you fear, Alexander?&quot;

Alexander looked at Cleitus, the young father that he wished his own father could have been. He could never get anything by Cleitus and he loved him all the more for it.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what it is I fear.&quot;

&quot;Fear can keep a man alive. It can also hinder him. Your fears hurt you both, Alexander. You&#39;re <em>not</em> going to lose the boy&#39;s love. He won&#39;t take another unless <em>you</em> drive him to it. And <em>everybody</em> dies. You might lose him to death. Or he might lose you. Only the gods know. But I know this. I have never seen a love like yours, and I have lived many years. I know in my heart that the gods grant eternity to those who love like you two. Enjoy what you have, Alexander. Enjoy <em>him.</em> He will always be your greatest treasure. So cherish him. He loves you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Cleitus. You know, you are getting quite romantic in your old age.&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Sire. And watch your boy.&quot;


Hephaestion had started a slow gallop around the field. He was like one with his horse. A true partnership. It was like he had a emotional relationship with&nbsp;his horse&nbsp;and used body language to control. His reins lay loosely on Aurum&#39;s neck.

The hardest part about using a bow while galloping was putting the arrow in. Hephaestion started galloping <em>after</em> setting the first arrow. In order to shoot the second target, he had to set the next arrow while galloping. And so on for the next several targets.

He hit his first target heads on and reached behind him for a second arrow. Instead of drawing back to his chest like most of the people of the day, Hephaestion drew back towards his cheek, almost touching his lips and chin. He hit all four of the front targets. The whole time he kept Aurum at a steady gait. He smoothly took out an arrow from a different quiver and dipped it into the fire pot, with out missing a beat. For the next target, that couldn&#39;t be shot at dead on, Hephaestion pointed his bow almost straight into the air. He had to time it exactly to be able to hit the target at a run and at an upwards angle. He drew back and smoothly let loose. The arrow made a perfect high arch and came down between the two targets, hitting the one in back. He did this for three more, never missing. 

Hephaestion put his bow over his arm and signaled his horse to slow down.&nbsp;Aurum was breathing heavily, but not dangerously so. He slowed to a canter. A smooth three beat gait between a trot and a walk, before slowing to a walk. Which he did for several minutes, cooling his horse down. And then to the amusement&nbsp;of Alexander and his companions, he leaned&nbsp;over&nbsp;to tightly hug Aurums neck and spoke softly into his ear.

&quot;Is that what he does to you, Alexander,&quot; Cassander teased, just as Hephaestion was nearing them. Upon hearing the men&#39;s laughter, he knew that they had made another joke about him. Long used to their teasing humor, Hephaestion smiled at the companions before locking eyes with his lover.

&quot;You did well, soldier,&quot; Cleitus said sternly.

Hephaestion shone with pride. A feat indeed. Not &#39;boy, not &#39;lad&#39;, Cleitus called him a soldier!

&quot;But don&#39;t get too cocky, boy. You still need to practice with your sword,&quot; added the general,&nbsp;playfully vexing the young man. 

Hephaestion moaned, and slipped his hand to Alexander, who now stood at his side.

&quot;I&#39;m proud of you, Hephaestion. You surprise me daily with your skills. If only your mother knew that the games you played with friends would help you as a soldier. I think your father wasn&#39;t a fool in your upbringing after all.&quot;

Hephaestion smiled down at his lover proudly before sliding down into his arms, handing his horse to a waiting groom.

&quot;Can we eat now. I&#39;m&nbsp;so hungry,&quot; Hephaestion lamented, drawing out his words. He smiled when he heard the quiet laughter. He was glad he was in Macedonia. What did these people laugh at, before he came along?


After bathing, Hephaestion went to join his king in the main hall. Few men were at court. It was a busy time, preparing to take an army on a quest for power.

Dinner was a joyous occasion. Hephaestion was greeted fondly and congratulated heartily. As usual, talk soon veered to the invasion of Persia. Hephaestion listened closely, sometimes offering a quiet suggestion. Some of the generals in Alexander&#39;s command simply tolerated him, but with a stern look from his three new friends, all listened cordially. He was fast becoming a valued member of Alexander&#39;s close knit friends.


After making their way to their rooms, Alexander put away the maps while Hephaestion used the bathroom.&nbsp;It came as a&nbsp;wonderful surprise to Alexander, when he found out that Hephaestion&#39;s father had collected maps from&nbsp;many different lands. Maps that he had given to Hephaestion. Alexander and his boy had spent many nights lately, pouring over the&nbsp;scrolls by the remaining sunlight and later by flickering candles. Hephaestion was adept at charting courses and seeing things that weren&#39;t written down, simply by the terrain of the topography of the map. The lovers enjoyed the time together. And Alexander&#39;s dream was fast becoming a dream of Hephaestion&#39;s as well.

Hephaestion left the bathroom and stared a bit at Alexander before he noticed. His lover was always telling him how beautiful he was, but Hephaestion thought that he couldn&#39;t compare with Alexander. He positively exuded power and a subtle masculinity, laced with a dangerous hint of potent sexuality. The lean animal grace of the way he walked, failed to cloak that maleness. His arrogance had both infuriated Hephaestion and infatuated him. When his lover turned, sweeping his eyes over the boy, Hephaestion felt dizzy with lust. Like a bird of prey, Alexander was transfixing him.

Alexander turned and was greeted with the sight of his mesmerizing lover. Never, had Alexander dreamed that there was so much beauty in the world. He desired this boy like no other.&nbsp;Hephaestion had come out of the room naked, his body gleaming in the light of the candle. His luminous eyes were filled with love and his lips slightly parted as if waiting to be kissed. They beckoned Alexander closer. Hephaestion&#39;s lips were cool and firm and soft against his own, there touch sending darkly chaotic thoughts and desires tumbling through him. Alexander&#39;s movement against Hephaestion&#39;s mouth was knowing and experienced, subduing the boy and then luring, tantalizing, and tormenting him to give the king the response he wanted.

The hands that had imprisoned Hephaestion were no longer doing so, instead one of them was curled behind his neck, supporting it, while the fingers of the other was entwined in the boy&#39;s hair, holding him still in willing enthrallment to the mastery of the kiss.

&quot;Bed,&quot; Alexander groaned in a raspy voice, pulling the sensual boy to the thickly furred bed. Hephastion was irresistibly responsive, making Alexander feel that the boy was powerless to control his reactions. It was a dangerously powerful aphrodisiac. The sensuality of Hephaestion&#39;s responses were driving Alexander out of his mind.

Alexander spread Hephaestion&#39;s legs and reached down to trace the cleft of his buttocks. He wanted foreplay, but was in to much of a hurry. Hephaestion&#39;s need was upon him and both needed fulfillment. Dipping his fingers in oil. His finger tip searched, circled, and stroked&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s pulsating entrance. While still moving his fingers inside the boy, Alexander moved over him, putting pillows under Hephaestion&#39;s bottom, he then started to slowly&nbsp;penetrate his lover. He watched how Hephaestion&#39;s eyes opened in erotic desire as he felt&nbsp;his body&nbsp;stretching to accommodate Alexander&#39;s thick, long cock. Alexander marveled at the tightness, almost overcome with his&nbsp;aching hunger for the boy.

Hephaestion clung to Alexander, overwhelmed by what he was feeling. The thickness inside him, filling him. His lover wasn&#39;t taking him hard tonight as he did most nights. He rocked inside Hephaestion&#39;s body, thrusting gently, touching that place inside that drove Hephaestion wild. 

Alexander took he and Hephaestion someplace different, a place so powerful and achingly sweet that tears almost came to his eyes at the thought of not reaching it. Desperately Hephaestion pressed closer to Alexander, lifting his legs, locking his heels into the kings buttocks, urging him on.&nbsp;He tightened his hole to grip Alexander, as he knew the man liked. Alexander started thrusting with exquisite torture. Hephaestion loved watching the passion on Alexander&#39;s face. He saw that his king was watching as his shaft buried itself inside Hephaestion&#39;s stretched opening. Hephaestion felt himself ready to climax, his body tightening around Alexander, squeezing him. He bucked his hips, willing Alexander to come with him. He moaned into his lovers mouth as he came over his and Alexander&#39;s chest.&nbsp;Feeling Hephaestion&#39;s body pulsate around him brought Alexander&#39;s own powerful orgasm, Crying out, the older man spilled himself deep inside the trembling boy.

In it&#39;s aftermath Hephaestion&#39;s body felt as though it&nbsp;were humming with happiness. Drowsily, he looked at Alexander, trying to suppress the small instinctive wince as Alexander withdrew from his body. His eyes opened wide, when he heard Alexander&#39;s words.

&quot;I love you, baby,&quot; Alexander said as he cleaned both he and Hephaestion of come.

Hephaestion gasped. Alexander <em>never</em> said it first, and usually waited until he thought that Hephaestion was asleep. He was shocked when he realized that he had spoken his thoughts aloud.

Alexander settled back down on the bed, pulling Hephaestion into his arms.

&quot;Even when I met you in the stables, I never intended to join with Hephaestion Amnitor. I wanted the boy I met though. I actually never intended to have a ceremony. I had the invitation to your home. I intended to talk your father into giving up peacefully. Macedonia ruled on all sides. The islands and the sea included. It was a matter of timing. I wanted his army willingly. I would have never consented to a marriage. If he had said no, I would have had an army in Athens faster then he knew what hit him. And the beautiful stable boy would have been a spoil of war. It wasn&#39;t until that Persian, Bessos, groped you and I found out who you <em>really </em>were, that I decided to marry you. I wanted you so badly. I didn&#39;t realize it was love until you told me that you loved me. It was in the loft after we made love.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Hephaestion whispered. &quot;I&#39;ll never forget.&quot;

&quot;Neither will I. You just have to give me time to come to terms with some things, Hephaestion. I do love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too. And you can have the rest of our lives to figure out how to love me. But, when we get to the afterlife, <em>I&#39;m </em>in charge.&quot;

Alexander laughed and held his boy tighter as he did every night before sleep.

&quot;We&#39;ll discuss it when it happens, my love. You know I don&#39;t like giving promises.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I know.&quot;

&quot;What do you say we take mother to the caves for a picnic lunch tomorrow.&quot; We&#39;ll be leaving soon. And I&#39;m going to be too busy to spend much time with her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that very much. She would too.&quot; Hephaestion remembered back to his birthday. Alexander had taken both he and Olympias to the caves for a picnic. They had brought Cleitus because it was he that best knew the confusing caverns. With torches, the four had explored and had a grand time in the depths of the ancient caves. Olympias had given him beautiful fabrics, that she was having made into clothes for her favorite boy. He had brought Alexander back to her and she was happy. It still wasn&#39;t perfect but Hephaestion would work on his stubborn lover. 

Morpheus had claimed his king. Hephaestion was happy to see the smile on the sleeping face. It was true that they would be leaving soon. They might not ever see their home again. That didn&#39;t matter to Hephaestion. He was the consort of the king, and home was where Alexander was.</font>

Hephaestion awoke with his head on the kings chest and the mans arms wrapped around him. Luxuriating in the feeling of being held, Hephaestion nestled in closer to the body that embraced him. His stomach chose that moment to wake up, reminding the boy that it had been almost a full day since his last meal.

&quot;I see I have been remiss&nbsp;in seeing to your needs,&quot; Alexander said drowsily.

&quot;Just the one, my king,&quot; Hephaestion moaned, tipping back his head to kiss Alexander&#39;s throat.

&quot;Mmm, we don&#39;t have time for that this morning, baby.&quot;

&quot;Why? You said we would spend the next few days together before I start my training.&quot; 

&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t realize how much there was to do. I have to get men to your father. Athens needs to know that I will help protect them. I learned last night that there were other things that need my attention also.&quot;

&quot;I need your attention,&quot; Hephaestion murmured, reaching down to&nbsp;arouse the kings awakening member. He rolled over to lie on top of his lover, reveling in the groan that passed from Alexander&#39;s lips.

Alexander gathered the boy tightly in his arms, rocking his hips so that their two slick&nbsp;cocks rubbed against each other. The friction caused Hephaestion to gasp and to buck his own hips, seeking gratification. 

&quot;Shh,&quot; Alexander hushed his lover. &quot;Slowly. Hmm, yes. Like that.&quot;

It didn&#39;t take long&nbsp;for the relief of orgasm to consume the two lovers. With a quick kiss to Hephaestion&#39;s forehead, Alexander rolled the boy off of him and got out of bed. His energy had been revived from the nights sleep and the lovemaking from the night before and again this morning. He went to the doors and told the servants to bring in the bath water he had known would be waiting. He relieved himself and waited for a grumbling Hephaestion to do the same.

Alexander refused help in their bathing, preferring to wash his boy himself. He talked while he scrubbed at Hephaestion&#39;s skin and hair.

&quot;My palace is pretty basic. I don&#39;t think you should have a problem finding your way around. Cleitus and Ptolemy made sure that anybody in the palace is to treat you with respect, so you should have no complaints. I will point the way to my mother&#39;s rooms, when we leave. She is expecting you to break your fast with her.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait. I am so hungry.&quot; Hephaestion licked his lips, like a child anticipating a meal.

Momentarily distracted by the pink tongue touching the passion swollen lips, Alexander shook his head to clear it from the sexually stimulating sight.

&quot;Hephaestion, aren&#39;t you frightened of spending time alone with my mother? I wish I could go with you. Maybe you had better postpone till tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Why, Alexander? Something else will just come up tomorrow. Besides, I like your mother. I don&#39;t see what all the uproar is about, I thought she was very nice.&quot; Hephaestion arched his back when after cleaning the boys front, Alexander nonchalantly cleaned the cleft of his bottom. 

Alexander liked the boys responses to his methodical cleansing. Kissing the smooth neck, Alexander patted the boy, motioning for him to rise and dry off. After quickly washing himself, Alexander reached for his own towel.

After carefully brushing their teeth with a fanned out hickory twig and ground mint and lemon paste,&nbsp;the kings consort&nbsp;again felt his tummy grumble.

&quot;Alexander, do you think your mother will have my coffee there?&quot; Hephaestion asked, getting back to more important matters. &quot;Did you tell anybody about it? Where <em>are</em> my things anyway?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Alexander snapped, already slightly annoyed with the boys preoccupation with his stomach.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Hephaestion snapped back. &quot;I&#39;m sure <em>you</em> had food when you went down to the hall last night. I haven&#39;t had anything since we broke our fast on the trail yesterday morn.&quot;

Feeling guilty because he had indeed eaten after leaving the room. Alexander had not thought to bring the boy back any food. Angry at his servants for not seeing to the boys comfort, he resolved to talk to his steward about Hephaestion&#39;s needs.

&quot;I will talk to somebody about your things, Hephaestion. I have clothes here for you to wear today. Clothes that were made for me and that I have never worn.&quot;

Satisfied with the&nbsp;closest thing to an&nbsp;apology that Alexander would give, Hephaestion cheerfully watched as Alexander handed him a sky blue chiton and white outer robe.

Alexander enjoyed watching Hephaestion dress while he himself pulled on his royal garments. He admired the way the blue chiton brought out the blue in his lover&#39;s eyes.&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s newly washed hair gleamed, the caramel highlights beckoning Alexander&#39;s fingers.

Reaching into the trunk, Alexander pulled out a gold crown. A gold headband really. With sapphires at the front. It was one that he had made when he was a prince. He had never worn it, because his father had died days after receiving it. The gold band looked incredible on Hephaestion, the king thought, as he slipped it on the boys head.

&quot;Oh, Alexander! It&#39;s beautiful, thank you,&quot; Hephaestion cried, throwing his arms around the kings neck and kissing his face and lips.

Alexander smiled, pleased with himself at being able to give his lover such a costly gift. The gold had the emblems and designs of the royal house, so everybody who saw Hephaestion would know that he belonged to the king. 

&quot;I will come to get you from my mothers wing in time for lunch, Hephaestion. If it is to much for you, then come back here.&quot;

Hephaestion laughed, &quot;You act is if you are sending me into the lions den, Sire. I think I can survive a morning with your mother. But, Alexander........do you think it would be alright for me to find my trunks? I wish to put on my pants. I am used to wearing them or my togas.&quot;

&quot;The togas are to short and show to much flesh. You can wear them with robes. The trousers are the garments of Persia. No man of Macedonia would wear them.&quot;

&quot;The men of Athens have always worn them,&quot; Hephaestion countered.&nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s wrong with them?&quot;

&quot;The servants and workers have worn them. Hephaestion, be reasonable,&quot; Alexander argued. &quot;You are a young man now. The trousers show off your behind. You will pardon me if I don&#39;t want my kingdom staring at your ass!&quot;</font></p><p><font size=""3"">&quot;So what. <em>You&#39;re</em> the only one touching my ass.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and I would like it to stay like that. Your trousers are very tempting.&quot;

&quot;But, they are more comfortable when&nbsp;I ride and when&nbsp;I shoot my bow.&quot;

Alexander rubbed his brow, feeling much older then his twenty-three years.

&quot;Hephaestion, are you trying to make me lose my patience? I am beginning to see why your mother and father kept such a close eye on you.&quot;

Hurt by the kings words, Hephaestion drew himself up and said haughtily, &quot;I am sorry I angered you, <em>my king</em>. I can not talk or feel hunger. Is there anything else&nbsp;I need to know that will upset you?&quot; 

Laughing at Hephaestion self-righteousness, Alexander pulled the boy into his arms and kissed the pouty lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t be a brat. And don&#39;t sulk. You want to be a soldier don&#39;t you? Soldiers don&#39;t pout.&quot;

Yielding to Alexander&#39;s warm lips on his own, Hephaestion pressed himself close to his lover&#39;s body. &quot;I don&#39;t want to not wear my pants ever again, Sire,&quot; he said breathily in the kings ear.

&quot;Alright Hephaestion, you can wear them when I take you riding. We will talk about whether you need them when you are shooting your bow. Now, I really must go, my beloved. Will you be alright with a guard showing you to my mothers wing?&quot;

&quot;Of course. I&#39;ll see you in a few hours.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you will be good, won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hephaestion asked tentatively.

&quot;I mean......don&#39;t get into any mischief. Remember your late night swim?&quot;

&quot;Gods, you are never going to let me live that down. I won&#39;t get into any mischief. I&#39;m just going to be with your mother.&quot;

&quot;Promise me, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to do this every time we part for a few hours?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion......&quot;

&quot;Alright, I promise. Zeus, you&#39;re worse then my mother.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alexander said, smiling at the boys antics. Patting him on his behind, Alexander led the way out the door.


Olympias put down the cup she was holding when it threatened to spill, still laughing at Hephaestion&#39;s story. The boy had been telling her of his and her sons first meeting in the barn. She beamed with delight when Hephaestion told her how he tried to be angry with her son for kissing&nbsp;who he thought was a slave. She felt happiness when the boy told her how he felt love at first sight when seeing the golden haired god. Instead of feeling the resentfulness she had expected to feel towards her sons consort, she felt a relief that she was no longer alone in loving Alexander. This strong boy would carry the burden of loving a king. Of having his best interests at heart. For the first time in many years she felt free.

Hephaestion stood to wander about the room. He pet one snake that was basking on a sill under the window. He admired the corded strength under the sleek skin.

Olympias watched the boy&nbsp;reverently touch one of her favorite pets.&quot;Do you like snakes, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;I like most animals, my queen.....Olympias, do you want to go riding? I mean, Alexander wanted to show me his palace, but if you want to show me the countryside.......well, I would like that.&quot;

Olympias sat quietly, mutely staring at the boy.

Hephaestion knelt at her&nbsp;feet and took her cold hands in his own. Mindful of the snake on her arm he gently rubbed her fingers.

&quot;My queen, what is the matter? Did I say something wrong?&quot;

Olympias studied the worried face of her sons consort. His was a beauty like her own. He would stay young looking for years. Desirable and seductive, yet much more gentle and innocent. Alexander would have a hard time leaving the bed of this stunning beauty.

&quot;My queen?&quot;

&quot;It has been years since anybody has asked me to ride,&quot; she said simply.

&quot;You can, can&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I love to ride. For years Phillip kept me prisoner to these rooms. After he died, I guess nobody thought to ask me what I would like. Do you suppose there is a gentle horse in the stables? Maybe my daughter&#39;s horse is still here,&quot; she said, answering her own question.

&quot;If not, then you can ride mine. He is broke perfectly.&quot; Deciding that Alexander <em>did </em>say that he could wear his pants when riding, he arranged to be back for the queen in fifteen minutes. He hoped his trunks were brought up as Alexander promised.

Hephaestion was surprised to see the older boy who had shared his husbands bed outside his corridor. Bolon looked as if he were going to the kings chamber when he spotted Hephaestion. He gave the consort a smirk and changed course. Hephaestion would have to remember to ask Alexander why his one time lover would be in these halls.

Hephaestion was glad to see his trunks in their room. Pushing aside his apprehensions that maybe he should tell Alexander his plans, he decided that maybe Alexander wouldn&#39;t even find out. It was still well over two hours till lunch time. And not having ridden in a long time, surely Olympias wouldn&#39;t want to ride far. Slipping his sandaled feet into his pants legs, Hephaestion pulled up his most loved trousers.

Running back down the corridor, he gathered Olympias and snuck out through her private garden to the stables. Both of them were caught up in the moment of seeking freedom. Olympias for years of repression. Hephaestion for the pure joy of devilry. They mounted their horses, Hephaestion letting Olympias borrow his saddle. It was light enough that her daughters horse would not shy and it was used to a blanket girth.&nbsp;They were headed out a side door when their path was blocked by one of the kings own companions.

Cleitus was talking to his own second in command while on his way to a companions meeting with the king. He was already a few minutes late, delayed by training programs. When he heard giggling and hushed voices, he thought it must be kids playing in the barns. When he heard the movement of horses from inside the palace stable, he thought to investigate. He smiled when he saw the mischievous duo. Grinned when he realized one of them was the kings own husband, the other his mother. Was this giggling youthful woman, the cold hearted creature who&nbsp;they whispered killed her own husband?

&quot;And where do you think you two are going?&quot; he asked in his&nbsp;most menacing voice.

The two stopped short, surprise and guilt on their faces.

&quot;Oh, Cleitus! We were just taking a quick ride,&quot; Hephaestion rushed to explain.

&quot;And does the king know that the two of you are riding by yourselves?&quot;

&quot;He didn&#39;t say that we <em>couldn&#39;t</em> ride, Cleitus.&quot;

Olympias sat back, not saying anything. She enjoyed watching Hephaestion and listening to him talk around the kings trusted companion. She herself had nothing against Cleitus. She remembered when her husband took the younger Cleitus as his eromenos. For a long while Phillip had loved the boy. Died loving him. That didn&#39;t stop her husband from taking younger boys and women to his bed. She and Cleitus both had suffered and paid a great price in loving a king. His brutal ways and roving eye would forever be a scar on both their souls. Maybe between them they could help Hephaestion not to suffer the same fate. For years she had lived in her husbands shadow. As a married woman, she had no options open to her. Hephaestion as the kings consort would have many limits, but he would have a mans freedom. And he could make his own happiness. Maybe this boy could tame Alexander&#39;s adulterous ways, where she could not tame Phillips. Olympias was brought out of her meanderings by Cleitus&#39;s voice.

&quot;My Queen, this is twice in less then a day that you have surprised me.&quot;

&quot;Well Cleitus, I&#39;d hate to be to predictable.&quot;

&quot;And where did you think you were going?&quot; Cleitus asked, pinning his eyes on young Hephaestion.

&quot;Olympias was telling me about some caves. We thought we would ride by them.&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t planning on going in them were you,&quot; Cleitus asked sharply?

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Olympias said.

&quot;Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Hephaestion answered, avoiding Cleitus&#39;s eyes. &quot;I just wanted to ride by.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion.......Alexander, Ptolemy and Cassander got lost in those caves for three days, and they hadn&#39;t even gone that far in. They are a maze of rooms and levels that spread for miles underground. It&#39;s dark and wet and confusing. Many have died in that&nbsp;labyrinth of caves.&quot;

Olympias who remembered that time with great fear, said softly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have let him go in the caves, Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;I know, my queen. But this one,&quot; he said, indicating Hephaestion, &quot; can get you to do just about anything. Aren&#39;t you sitting on top of a horse for the first time in twenty years, getting ready to sneak out of the palace?&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; cried the indignant Hephaestion. &quot;I&#39;m not that bad. I wouldn&#39;t have gone in the caves.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, just in case, I&#39;d better go with you.&quot;

&quot;Cleitus, you don&#39;t have to go with us.&quot;

&quot;Tell that to the king when he flogs me for letting you two go by yourselves.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it would be better if he did escort us,&quot; Olympias reasoned. &quot;For me, of course. I haven&#39;t ridden in so long. I don&#39;t know if I remember the way.&quot;

Chastened, Hephaestion nodded and waited for Cleitus and Tolus to quickly grab their mounts.

As it turned out, it was a fun day. They rode by streams and rocky caverns. They rode by the dark mouth of the caves. All of them shivering from the sinister echo they could hear from the depths of the cave. Olympias told Hephaestion stories of a younger Alexander. Cleitus told Olympias and Tolus about Hephaestion&#39;s almost abduction by the Persians. In return, Hephaestion told Olympias and a laughing Tolus about Cleitus&#39;s afternoon in the sea with Hephaestion&#39;s two younger sisters. 

It was a laughing and lighthearted foursome that rode into the stables in the early evening. Unmindful that it was hours after lunchtime.


A deep fear ran like ice water through the king veins. His mother and lover had been missing for hours. Could they have been abducted? At one point, Alexander even wondered if his mother had faked her fondness for Hephaestion and abducted him herself, taking him to her native land. His gut wrenched when he thought about some soldier seeing&nbsp;his beautiful boy and trying to take him for his own. His mother being hurt in the process.

&quot;Aurum is gone, Alexander. Nobody would ride Hephaestion&#39;s horse. Your sisters horse is missing also.&quot;

&quot;By the Gods! Did anybody see anything? Somebody had to. Ptolomy, start asking the people. Cassander, let&#39;s.........&quot;

They were interrupted by the arrival of his missing loved ones and a laughing general and second&nbsp;in the generals unit.

Cleitus and Olympias were enjoying talking about the past. Years later, they could laugh about the pain and jealousies of loving Phillip.

Tolus, who was in the kings cavalry and also a archer in the unit was laughing as he recounted his first days as page for Cleitus. Hephaestion listened to the tales and knew that he could be a part of this very elite group.&nbsp; 

Alexander watched as Cleitus helped his mother off her horse. She was glowing. Alexander never remembered her looking so carefree and happy. He was astounded when she smiled he thanks up to her own husbands lover. But it was his own lover where his anger knew no bounds. Alexander watched as Tolus, Cleitus&#39;s long time page and second in command of his unit helped Hephaestion off his horse. They were laughing and talking about something. Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed when Tolus let his hands linger on Hephaestion&#39;s slim waist. It was when he saw the mans eyes rove over&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s delectable bottom encased in trousers that Alexander&#39;s rage came to the surface of it&#39;s confinement. Trousers!

Alexander flew at the unsuspecting Tolus. The flying punch landing squarely on his jaw. He grabbed the reins of Aurum as Tolus slid easily onto the ground. He heard his mother cry out and saw Hephaestion look about in confusion. When the boys eyes met the irate eyes of the king, he trembled at the fury he witnessed.

&quot;Mother, go to your rooms,&quot; Alexander said, still staring at his mischievous imp of a&nbsp;lover.

&quot;Alexander, I think...........&quot;

&quot;By the Gods, woman,&quot; Alexander cried vehemently, turning so that she could see the full force of his fury. &quot;Go to your rooms now!&quot;</font></p><p><font size=""3"">After seeing his mother walk out with as much dignity as she could muster, Alexander turned back to his young consort. Trying to tone down his anger, he gripped Hephaestion&#39;s hand and pulled him from the barn. Leaving the horses for Cassander to take care of, Cleitus followed a short distance behind.</font></p><p><font size=""3"">Alexander realized that his worry for Hephaestion&#39;s safety and his jealousy at seeing the hand of Tolus on his lovers waist, was now&nbsp;seething inside him. Trying to calm enraged feelings, he quietly told his lover to go to their rooms and he would follow after he talked to Cleitus.

&quot;Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion whispered shakily, &quot;Cleitus...........&quot;

&quot;You will not argue for Cleitus&#39;s defense. He knows what he did wrong. Don&#39;t you Cleitus?&quot; Alexander asked, turning to one of his most loved companions.

&quot;Yes, Sire,&quot; Cleitus said in a stoic manner.

&quot;But, Alexander.......&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, I swear to the Gods, if you don&#39;t get to our rooms now, I will...........!&quot; Alexander stopped his tirade in mid sentence. &quot;Now Hephaestion,&quot; he told the boy.


Bolon had been listening behind doors and walls most of the day. Flattening himself against the outside of the stable doors, he listened to Alexander order the brat to their rooms. He couldn&#39;t hope to get rid of the Athenian, but maybe he could drive a wedge between them enough that Alexander might turn to Bolon for comfort. Alexander was a man of fiery passions. Surely this boy couldn&#39;t hope to satisfy the king in the bedroom? Seeing a chance to undermine the boys confidence, Bolon sped up the back stairwell to reach the royal chambers before Hephaestion.

Hephaestion&#39;s heart threatened to hammer out of his chest. Alexander had been so angry. How could Hephaestion hope to get Alexander to forgive him without first being punished?

Shock and unimaginable pain swept through the boy as he stepped into his and Alexander&#39;s bedroom. Bolon was in the act of getting out of bed. His back was to the door and he was pulling a&nbsp;robe from the tangled covers of the bed.

Bolon heard Hephaestion open the door. It wasn&#39;t hard to pretend as if he were just now getting out of bed after an afternoon of unavowed sex. This would send the little virgin running back to his arrogant homeland.

Hephaestion&#39;s jealousy exceeded his capacity for clear thought. His rage took over. It was inconceivable to the boy that Alexander would act so possessive when he himself had spent the afternoon in a tryst with his illicit lover. Extreme anger welled up inside. A violence he had never known. So intense were his emotions, he didn&#39;t stop to think. Hephaestion slipped out the knife he carried in his belt&nbsp;as he advanced on the older boy.

Bolon&#39;s superior smirk turned to dread as he saw Hephaestion&#39;s approach. His eyes missed the knife being palmed, he could only see the violence in the younger mans eyes.

Hephaestion would never forget the sight of this man&#39;s lips on Alexander&#39;s. Knowing that he had just left the bed&nbsp;where the king had taken Hephaestion on&nbsp;the night before, gave the consort the added strength of revenge, even though Bolon was most likely trained in fighting.

&quot;You,&quot; Hephaestion hissed. &quot;You should be dead!&quot;

Bolon took no note of the words as his eyes, wide with amazement,&nbsp;moved over the boy.

Knowing that the older boy had the training of a soldier, Hephaestion moved towards him in a slow tread. As long as the older boy did not notice the dagger gripped in his fist, Hephaestion would have him. He spoke to draw the other boys eyes to his face.

&quot;What were you doing here?&quot;

&quot;What does it look like?&quot; Bolon goaded, unaware of his danger. &quot;Surely, you cant be so inno.........?&quot;

Hephaestion struck, aiming for his throat. Bolons reflexes were better then he had anticipated, so Hephaestion changed direction, slashing beneath the arm he had raised to block the attack. Bolon was quick, he jumped back to avoid the cut. So as it was, Hephaestion&#39;s blade only ripped open his chiton, drawing a thin line of blood. Hephaestion saw this even has he spun about for momentum to come around for a side attack on the other boy&#39;s neck. 

Hephaestion&#39;s&nbsp;hand was caught by the wrist, Bolon bringing his other hand up to reach for the blade.

&quot;By the Gods, Athenian, stop this!&quot;

&quot;When you are dead, Macedonian dog,&quot; Hephaestion spat!

With&nbsp;his free hand,&nbsp;Hephaestion gripped a handful of his rivals hair to pull him off balance. Bolon turned his body into Hephaestion&#39;s, locking his arm arm under the&nbsp;younger boys, so that Hephaestion could no longer maneuver. Bolon was free to pry Hephaestion&#39;s fingers off the blade. Hephaestion almost screamed in rage when he felt the blade slip from his grasp. But before Bolon could turn back to face him, Hephaestion locked both his hands together and used them like a club to the back of the older boys head.

The blow sent Bolon staggering out into the hall, where he slammed against the opposite wall. The dagger had fallen to the floor, halfway between them. Hephaestion made a jump for it but Bolons cursed robe tripped up his feet and he lost his balance.&nbsp; His husbands lover turned just as he was falling and threw himself at the younger boy. The momentum carried them both&nbsp;further down the hall where they landed heavily on the floor.

This would have been the end if Hephaestion&#39;s jealousy wasn&#39;t so great. As it was, Bolon thought he was finished. He had fallen on top of Hephaestion and gripped a wrist in each hand, holding them beside the consorts head. He looked down at Hephaestion with ill concealed hatred.&nbsp;He couldn&#39;t kill the other boy, he would be killed himself for such a crime. Bolon had expected tears from the untrained Athenian, not attack.

&quot;Cease this,&quot; he demanded.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you not to slither in beds that are not your own,&quot; Hephaestion cried. He threw the older boy to the side and in an instant was on top of him and had his head between his hands. Twice Hephaestion slammed his rivals head onto the floor before arms encircled his waist and lifted him off.

Hephaestion struggled until the arms tightened, squeezing the breath from his body. The kings voice hissed in his ear, &quot;Be still!&quot; Hephaestion was forced to admit defeat. Watching the&nbsp;older boy, still bleeding and being helped to his feet by Cleitus, made him feel much better.

&quot;What in the God&#39;s name is going on here?&quot; Alexander demanded.


Cleitus and Alexander were slowly walking to the kings rooms. Cleitus was&nbsp; penitent under his kings fury. It was only the long time bond between them that kept Cleitus from a sever public beating. If more people&nbsp;other then Cassander and Ptolemy were witness to Hephaestion&#39;s and the queens absence from the palace, then Cleitus had no doubt that punishment would have been swift. He was not so sure that Hephaestion would escape a strong hand to his pert little behind. He was sure to keep the smile from his face at that thought. Considering his kings&nbsp;merited anger, he was most prudent.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Alexander. I didn&#39;t know they were not allowed to ride.&quot;

&quot;Did you honestly think that I would let my lover and my mother ride by them selves on Hephaestion&#39;s first day here?&quot;

&quot;They were about to ride off by themselves, Alexander. I thought only to accompany them.&quot;

&quot;I am grateful that you were there, Cleitus. And I know how mischievous Hephaestion can be. He has a way of winding you around his little finger. You should have sent Tolus to inform me of their plans.&quot;

&quot;I know, Sire. And I&#39;m sorry, I can only ask for you forgiveness.&quot;

&quot;Did your lieutenant talk during the whole ride to Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Sire...........my king, Tolus was very respectful to both Hephaestion and your mother. Alexander, Tolus likes women. I have never seen him with a man before.&quot;

&quot;His hands were on Hephaestion&#39;s waist, Cleitus. And his eyes were on his ass!&quot;

&quot;Alexander, I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t realize that he was behaving improperly. And he was probably staring at the boys trousers. They <em>are</em> a bit shocking.&quot;

Alexander was still livid about the trousers, but before he could finish his thought, he heard a crash and shouting. He and Cleitus looked at each other.

&quot;That&#39;s Hephaestion, &quot; they said at the same time, running around the corner of the corridor. Shocked at the sight before them , they waded into the fight.

Enraged with the squirming boy in his arms, Alexander demanded to know what was happening.

&quot;Fuck you, Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion hissed.

&quot;By the Gods, you <em>will </em>tell me,&quot; he stormed. He put Hephaestion on his feet, gripped his arm and propelled him into the room. Looking back at Cleitus he told his companion to take the other boy away and watch him until Alexander could get there.

Alexander pushed Hephaestion into the chair. Nobody had ever given him cause for such an internal struggle before Hephaestion. The boy needed a firmer hand then Alexander had been giving him.

&quot;You have lied to me today, went against my wishes, and put yourself and my mother in danger. And what do&nbsp;I find when I return to my rooms? An aggressive fight between my consort and my former lover. What possessed you to such hostility, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Former lover? Currant lover, you mean! He wasn&#39;t out of the room in time for my return,&quot; Hephaestion spat!

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;He was in the room, getting out of bed and pulling a robe from the bed.&quot;

Alexander wondered if Bolon had been gathering his clothes and Hephaestion had interrupted him. Looking at the disorderly bed, Alexander wondered at the chaotic mess the sheets were in. The maids usually cleaned as soon as he left the rooms in the morning.

&quot;Did he say that we had slept together, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;No......but.....he implyed it.&quot;

&quot;I gave him permission to gather his clothing. He was doing that or he was trying to cause trouble. Either way, you should have had more faith in me.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, I......&quot;

&quot;Be quiet,&quot; the king warned in a hushed voice. &quot;I promised you several times that I wouldn&#39;t touch or bed Bolon ever again. I gave you my word. What have I done to cause such mistrust in you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, my king,&quot; Hephaestion whispered, looking down at his hands that were locked in his lap.

&quot;I have refused to give you promises that you have wished for, because I was unsure of my ability to keep them. The promises I do give you, obviously count for nothing.&quot;

Hephaestion sobbed.

&quot;I......I&#39;m sorry, Alexander. He made me so mad. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. I.......&quot; Hephaestion couldn&#39;t finish. He was so upset from the pained expression on his lovers face.

Heaving a sigh, Alexander relented.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Hephaestion. You were actually quite courageous.&nbsp;I was impressed with your fighting and your bravery. Besides, I would have done the same thing.&quot;

&quot;You did,&quot; Hephaestion said, remembering poor Tolus who was struck to the ground.

Alexander rubbed at his brow. A headache was forming. He went to sit in the opposite chair.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t excuse your behavior today.&quot; Alexander wouldn&#39;t be swayed by the tears forming in Hephaestion&#39;s beautiful&nbsp;eyes as the boy looked at him. &quot;When did I say I would come to get you, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Lunchtime.&quot;

&quot;And didn&#39;t I tell you to stay in the queens chamber or to come back here?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;What are you wearing, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Trousers.&quot;

&quot;Pants that I ordered you could not wear!&quot;

&quot;You......you said that I could wear them when I rode, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;And you were not supposed to be riding, were you? I also told you that you could wear your pants when you went riding with </font><font size=""3""><em>me.&quot;</em>

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sire,&quot; Hephaestion whispered.

&quot;You lied to me. You snuck out and put yourself in a possible dangerous situation. Neither you <em>or</em> my mother knows these hills. Do you think it is good for our relationship&nbsp;when&nbsp;one of us lies to the other?&quot;

&quot;N....no.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever stop to think that maybe my feelings&nbsp;might be hurt? I wanted to ride with you. To be the first to show you the lands that&nbsp;mean so much&nbsp;to me?&quot;

Hephaestion put his face in his hands. Tears were running freely down his face.

&quot;Come here, Hephaestion.&quot;

Hephaestion rose on legs that shook and crossed the distance to his angry lover.

&quot;Maybe if I had spanked you after your late night swim, I wouldn&#39;t have to do so now. You promised me you wouldn&#39;t sneak out anymore, Hephaestion.&quot;

Hephaestion couldn&#39;t speak, such was his fear.

&quot;Come on, it won&#39;t be so bad, and then it will all be over.&quot; Alexander leaned down to unlace the boys sandals before pulling the trousers down over slim hips and naked buttocks.

&quot;Please, Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion suddenly cried. &quot;Please don&#39;t do this. I won&#39;t do it again. I promise.&quot;

&quot;I know, baby. I believe you. You have to be punished though,&quot; Alexander said, drawing the boy over his knees, hands on the floor and bottom high in the air.

Hephaestion nearly cried when he felt Alexander gently stroking his upturned buttocks. The first slap drove all thoughts from his head. He felt so vulnerable when burning pain spread over his right cheek. Three more hard swats were delivered on his upturned bottom. Both cheeks now burned enough that Hephaestion started to kick and squirm on the kings lap. After two more painfully hard spanks, Hephaestion started to cry and yell in earnest.

Alexander rubbed the rosy bottom. His hand was stinging and the heat emanating from Hephaestion&#39;s clenching ass assured him that <em>it</em> was stinging also.

&quot;Four more. You can do it. I want you to remember this. It might help you to learn not to lie to me. You will not sneak away again. And if you ever wear your trousers when I say no again, I&#39;ll burn them.&quot;

&quot;Please, Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion sobbed. &quot;I&#39;ll be good. No more.&quot;

Hephaestion felt the warm hand on his back. anchoring him, warning him for what was to come. He knew by now not to clench his bottom. It hurt more when he did. But, he couldn&#39;t help it.

Alexander delivered four more hard slaps while&nbsp;the boy&nbsp;fought with himself to stay still. He almost howled&nbsp;from the pain, and then finally Hephaestion&#39;s ordeal was over. 

The king pulled his sobbing lover into his arms. Hephaestion flinched when the fabric of Alexander&#39;s robe brushed against his buttocks, but he cuddled into the kings embrace anyway. His bottom was on fire, and yet he cried harder from his lovers forgiving words.

&quot;Shh,&quot; Alexander crooned. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I forgive you. It&#39;s all over now. Calm down, Hephaestion.&quot; Alexander held the sobbing boy in his arms until he quieted down. He relished the feel of Hephaestion. He was embarrassed that his cock was hard after delivering punishment to his boy. How could he help it though when Hephaestion was all over him and so adorable.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Hephaestion whispered.&nbsp;&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, baby,&quot; Alexander said fondly. &quot;Lay back and rest now. I&#39;ll order food to be brought up. We&#39;ll go down to the hall tomorrow. Would you like that?&quot;

&quot;Just the two of us?&quot;

&quot;Yes, just us.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

Alexander held his boy. He could no longer contemplate life without Hephaestion.

&quot;Hephaestion,&quot; Alexander said some time later.

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;I have to go down and talk to Bolon.&quot;

Hephaestion sat up, grimacing from the friction on his sore bottom. &quot;Why?&quot; he asked plaintively. &quot;Can&#39;t you see him in the morning?&quot;

&quot;I have to take care of this tonight.&quot;

&quot;This is the second night that you have left me alone. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re leaving me to go to him!&quot;

Alexander smiled at his lover&#39;s dramatic flair. &quot;I am <em>not</em> leaving you and going to him.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to spank him also?&quot;

&quot;I only spank the boys I love. I punish others in a much more harmful way,&quot;&nbsp;the king&nbsp;laughed.

Alexander pushed the boy off of him to go to the door. He had to see Nearchus before he&nbsp;left. The sailor was about to have a passenger.

&quot;I&#39;ll bring back some food and wine. I&#39;ll even rub some balm into your bottom.&quot;

&quot;Gods Alexander, are you going to tell anybody you spanked me?&quot;

&quot;I think they might have heard your screams, my&nbsp;beloved. Don&#39;t worry, by now Cleitus has told of your beating my former lover.&quot;

&quot;Then they&#39;ll think you spanked me for that!&quot;

Alexander laughed. The things his boy found to worry about. Before he left the room he turned back to his remorseful lover.

&quot;Hephaestion, be here when I get back.&quot;</font></p></div>"

"event","<p><font size=""3"">The Kings Consort<br />part eight</font></p><lj-cut><p></p><p><br /><font size=""3"">Alexander looked down into Hephaestion&#39;s now turbulent eyes. Seeing the war raging in their blue depths, the king knew when to retreat.<br /><br />&quot;You won&#39;t be looking into any eyes but my own while lovemaking, Hephaestion. I&#39;ll hear no more talk of either of us taking another to our beds.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Does that mean you won&#39;t take another lover?&quot;<br /><br />Kissing the pouty lips, Alexander sighed into his lovers mouth. He knew joining would come back to give him grief. Why he thought a boy would be more understanding then a woman, he didn&#39;t know.<br /><br />&quot;You wear me out. I have no intentions of bedding another at this time. When and if that changes, we will talk of it then.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But, your men......&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I regret the greeting you received, Hephaestion. My men were made to understand that this was a political joining only. I let them know that I wouldn&#39;t be averse to your taking a lover. They still shouldn&#39;t have treated you in that fashion. Respect for the royal house should always be in attendance.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Starting with you, my lord,&quot; Hephaestion uttered.<br /><br />Drawing away to look askance at his young husband, Alexander was beginning to let his anger show.<br /><br />&quot;I am king here Hephaestion. You will do well to remember that. I will not be taken to task by you or any other. I have admitted my wrongs to you. I will let my men know that you are a welcome addition into my life.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Is that what I am? A welcome addition? Like a new piece of furniture or a new pet?&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander stared at the mesmeric boy. Hephaestion was now kneeling naked upon the bed. His sated phallus resting on his supple thigh. His smooth young chest heaving. His full lips were open and begging to be ravished. His hypnotic eyes were dancing with smoldering fire. Ignoring the conversation that was starting to exasperate him,&nbsp;Alexander reached for his arousing lover.<br /><br />Hephaestion being young, made his first mistake with his king. Pulling away from Alexander, he issued a declaration.<br /><br />&quot;I want your word that you won&#39;t bed another, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Or what?&quot; Alexander hissed. &quot;You won&#39;t grant me use of your body? Sexual favors, to get your own way? You will see how&nbsp;bribery sways me, Hephaestion,&quot; Alexander warned as he rose from the bed.<br /><br />&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Hephaestion demanded.<br /><br />&quot;I do not wish to be here any longer. I go to have a drink with my friends.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;ll go with you,&quot; the boy cried, making to scramble from the bed.<br /><br />Alexander stepped forward to push Hephaestion back onto the bed. The boy lay sprawled on his back and elbows, tears now streaming down his bewildered face.<br /><br />&quot;You will stay,&quot; Alexander ordered. &quot;I wanted your company minutes ago. You refused me!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Is Bolon going to be there?&quot; Hephaestion whispered.<br /><br />&quot;Enough,&quot; Alexander roared, slapping his hand down onto a dresser!! &quot;I made you a promise about Bolon. You doubt me? The word of your king is not enough?&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion sobbed and stared fearfully at the unfamiliar man blazing down upon him.<br /><br />Alexander had to look away from the mesmerizing sight. The candles were flickering over the golden skin, now quivering from fear and rejection. The tremulous eyes were pools of blue. Alexander could see the perfect balls hiding the cleft of Hephaestion&#39;s bottom. The want and need was ready to explode from Alexander. The boy caused riotous emotions inside the king. Relenting, he glanced back at the spellbinding sight of his lover.<br /><br />&quot;If Bolon is there, I will take the opportunity to tell him he is no longer my lover. I will return shortly, Hephaestion. Please compose yourself.&quot; Alexander didn&#39;t glance back a second time before he walked out the door.<br /><br />Feeling cold, Hephaestion brought the blankets up around his body. He would use the bathroom and wash up before Alexander returned. He had felt hungry a while ago. Now though, all he felt was a knot in his stomach. He wouldn&#39;t know how to go about getting food anyway. He didn&#39;t know who to call and he dare not leave the chamber.<br /><br />After using the bathroom, Hephaestion looked around his temporary prison. He didn&#39;t want to explore or to look at Alexander&#39;s things without his lover being there. Crawling back into bed, Hephaestion realized that he would have to give in on this. Alexander wouldn&#39;t back down. The king would do what he wanted. The only thing Hephaestion could hope for is that Alexander wouldn&#39;t desire anybody as much as his husband. Wouldn&#39;t love anybody as much as his husband. And if Alexander did stray, then Hephaestion hoped his love could be strong enough to bring Alexander home.<br /><br />For several days Hephaestion had lived in blissful happiness. Well, he could still be happy. He would just have to change his way of thinking. His joyous dreams had been shattered tonight. If he wanted to follow the king on his ambitious quest for glory, then he would have to learn to make Alexander&#39;s dream his own.<br /><br />Hephaestion cuddled back under the blankets. Closing his eyes, he prayed for sleep to claim him. He thought about the love that Alexander had shown him. He thought about the passion he could always see in Alexander&#39;s eyes when looking upon the younger man. Hephaestion tried <em>not</em> to think about the loneliness he felt in the big bed, on this, the first night in the palace of Alexander. Hephaestion was unaware of the tears that streaked his cheeks as he fell into an uneasy slumber.<br /><br /><br />Alexander paused outside the door. Sickened at the thought that he had wanted to rape his young lover. Had wanted to shut his mouth with hard kisses. Had wanted to push inside the angry boy and impose his will on the lithesome youth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander covered his face with his hands. He remembered his father raping his mother, impervious to her cries. He remembered his mothers tears when his father would take a new lover. The younger Alexander had always wished that Phillip would stay faithful to his mother, the mother to the heir. Alexander remembered how he had vowed that he would find a love and cherish that person. Never give them cause for anguish like his mother&#39;s. How naive was his thinking? He now had that love, and the boy lay crying alone in their bedchamber. Alexander would <em>never</em> give the promise of monogamy. Never make a promise that he knew he wouldn&#39;t keep. He would have to be careful that Hephaestion was never hurt by any affair. Had to make sure that Hephaestion knew that he was loved and adored. Revered in the bed of the king. Most of all he would have to make sure that he never gave Hephaestion reason to look elsewhere. He had meant what he said when he told Hephaestion that he would be allowed no other lover. He wanted no other hands but his own on the body of his breathtaking consort. He would have that drink of wine and return to his husband. Without promising anything, he would let his lover know that he wanted no other man in his bed.<br /><br /><br />Bolon saw the king outside of the royal bedchamber. If Alexander wasn&#39;t inside with his new partner then Bolon knew he still had a chance. He had made a major miscalculation today and would have to admit fault before Alexander pointed out his error. He would win back the bed of Macedonia&#39;s leader through understanding and respect. He hadn&#39;t come this far to give up his place of power to some young Athenian brat. He quickly pulled off some of his clothes to wrap the items under his arms.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander looked up to see Bolon picking up an outer robe to shove the garment under his arm. Alexander was angry. At Hephaestion. At Bolon. But mainly at himself. If only he had pushed Bolon away from him earlier today. His one time lover had taken him by surprise. And when Alexander felt the familiar lips pressed against his own, he hadn&#39;t thought of pushing the boy away. It was only when he saw Hephaestion&#39;s tormented face and heard his mothers scorn that he thought of doing something. By then it was to late. If he had stopped the kiss right away and made Hephaestion feel secure, then none of this would be happening. Hephaestion would never have thought of questioning Alexander&#39;s fidelity. He couldn&#39;t yell at Hephaestion any more. Not if he wanted the boy&#39;s submission to outside influences. No, he could only take out his anger on the boy who used to share his bed. Moving silently and deliberately over to his long time lover, he was shocked when the boy threw himself on the floor at Alexander&#39;s feet.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Sire. I&#39;m sorry I hurt you and your new consort. I had missed you so much and I wasn&#39;t thinking. I would never do anything that would intentionally cause you trouble.&quot; Bolon sobbed against Alexander&#39;s ankles.<br /><br />&quot;Bolon. Bolon, stop. You may get up.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander stared down with bemusement at the shaking page. When Bolon looked up at him with tears in his brown eyes, Alexander couldn&#39;t help thinking about the big blue eyes full of tears that he had just left. These eyes didn&#39;t have the luminous quality or the thick long lashes that Alexander liked feeling flutter against his skin. Shaking his head, Alexander realized that it wasn&#39;t fair to either of his lovers to make comparisons. Both pair of eyes were full of tears. Zeus save him&nbsp; from over emotional boys.<br /><br />Looking up at Alexander, Bolon knew that he had successfully swayed Alexander&#39;s chastisement. The tears weren&#39;t hard to fake. He had such fear of losing the king that he genuinely did tear up.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m sorry, my king,&quot; he cried, clinging harder to Alexander&#39;s leg. &quot;I think I should be punished. I will let you beat me if you wish it, Sire. I won&#39;t put up any fight.&quot; Good touch, he thought.<br /><br />&quot;Bolon, get up. I am too tired for this,&quot; Alexander groaned as he pulled the boy to his feet.&nbsp; &quot;What are you doing in the hall anyway?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus made me leave so fast, I hardly had time to gather my things. I dropped some and he wouldn&#39;t let me pick them up. Alexander, do you forgive me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What you did was very wrong, Bolon. What possessed you to kiss me in front of my consort? Even my mother saw you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I wasn&#39;t thinking. I just missed you. Will you punish me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No.....no, I won&#39;t punish you. Bolon, I promised Hephaestion I wouldn&#39;t see you anymore. We can no longer be lovers.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am disappointed of course. Do you love your new consort, Alexander?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Zeus, help me. I do.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Then, I am happy for you, Sire.&quot; Seeing the skeptical&nbsp;look in the kings eyes, Bolon drew himself up proudly. &quot;I know what people say about me. That I only slept with you because you are king. That I looked to further myself. Well, I don&#39;t care what they say. I <em>do</em> care about what you think. I feel things for you that are not returned. I only wish for your happiness. Yours and your consort. Please don&#39;t diminish my feelings.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander had slept with the boy for months. Had feelings for his one time page. It wasn&#39;t what he felt for Hephaestion, but he did owe the boy more then his skepticism.<br /><br />&quot;I am sorry, Bolon. Thank you, you are a good friend.&quot;<br /><br />Bolon looked to Alexander tenderly.<br /><br />&quot;We are friends, aren&#39;t we Alexander? You won&#39;t just ignore me when we meet, will you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You have been a good page, and will make a good soldier. I am proud to call you friend.&quot; Alexander didn&#39;t see any way out of declaring friendship to the boy. Hadn&#39;t Bolon declared his own loyalty?<br /><br />&quot;One more thing, Sire. Then I will slip down the back stairs to the soldiers quarters.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What is it?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;May I come to your rooms to pick up the rest of my clothing?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bolon......I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br /><br />Bolon hurried on almost fearfully. &quot;I don&#39;t want to cause you any problems with Hephaestion, Sire. I can come when he is not there. It will only take a minute. I......I don&#39;t have a mother, my king. And I don&#39;t get paid much. Sire, I don&#39;t have many clothes.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Bolon. Yes, you may get your things. I&#39;ll tell you when. Run along now. Go get some sleep.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, Sire. Good health, Alexander.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander watched the boy hurry to the back stairs before he continued down to the court rooms. Poor kid, he thought. He wished he had given the boy more when they were together.<br /><br />Bolon stared back balefully at the monarch&#39;s door. Soon, he thought ominously. The Athenian would be relegated to the queens wing before too long. And he, Bolon; would be right back where he belonged.<br /><br /><br />Several of the soldiers had come up to Alexander and&nbsp;apologized for their behavior. Ptolemy and&nbsp;Cassander had let all know that Hephaestion held an important part in the kings life. Cleitus was much more forceful in convincing the soldiers and men of the court that Alexander was in love with the boy. Woe betide any that interfered in their relationship.<br /><br />&quot;What are you doing here, Alexander?&quot; Ptolomy asked kindly.<br /><br />&quot;I hear your boy is quite beautiful,&quot; said Nerarchus, who sat on the other side of the king. &quot;You should be up showing him the ways of love instead of being down here with us.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander watched the drunken depravity in his hall. Things were better then they were in his fathers time. Alexander didn&#39;t allow rape. Other then that, almost any thing goes in the court of Macedonia.&nbsp;Tomorrow there would be a feast for he and Hephaestion. He would have to ask Cleitus to ask the men to tone it down a bit. Hephaestion was still so new to night time court life.<br /><br />&quot;Alexander. Alexander!&quot;<br /><br />Alexander looked up to see an angry Cleitus standing over him.<br /><br />&quot;Why are you here?&quot;<br /><br />Alexander grimaced and looked away.<br /><br />&quot;By the Gods, you had a fight with him already, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t think that is any of your business, General.&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus laughed and sat down beside the king, pushing Ptolemy off the couch. Privately he whispered into Alexander&#39;s ear.<br /><br />&quot;You are not to old for me to box your ears. What did you do to him?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He was upset about Bolon.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;As well he should be. You didn&#39;t break his spirit, did you, Alexander?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He threatened to take a lover, Cleitus,&quot; Alexander spat.<br /><br />Cleitus bellowed. &quot;That&#39;s the lad! Good for him, for&nbsp;showing some spunk.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus, he can&#39;t take another lover.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nor does he want to, Alexander, It was just threats. He&#39;s a boy, and he doesn&#39;t know how to handle his rivals.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He has no rivals. What if he meant it, Cleitus?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alexander, you&#39;re the king. It doesn&#39;t matter what he wants,&quot; Ptolemy said from the floor, where he lay sprawled at Cleitus&#39;s feet. He tried to get up when a servant girl met his eyes.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Go back to your rooms, Sire,&quot; Cleitus said. &quot;You have a delectable boy waiting in your bed.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Wish I did,&quot; Nearchus moaned. He held out his cup to Cassander, who was sitting next to him with a jug of wine.<br /><br />&quot;Bemoaning your sex life again,&quot; Cassander teased. &quot;Alexander what are you doing here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m going, I&#39;m going. By Zeus, all you people do is interfere in my relationship!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Good thing,&quot; Ptolemy muttered as Alexander&nbsp;stormed away.<br /><br />&quot;First fight after only a week?&quot; Nearchus asked.<br /><br />&#39;More like third or forth,&quot; Cassander laughed.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t let Hephaestion&#39;s beauty fool you when you meet him,&quot; Cleitus warned.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;He is an impudent little minx,&quot; Ptolemy added.<br /><br />&quot;Well, I won&#39;t be meeting him for awhile. I will be meeting his father first,&quot; Nearchus said. &quot;I meet with Alexander tomorrow morning to discuss my trip to Athens. I sail tomorrow night. It seems they are in need of help from marauding Persians.&quot;<br /><br />The other three generals looked at each other and launched into the tale of Hephaestion&#39;s late night swim and Persian abductors.<br /><br /><br />Alexander&#39;s body was taut and frustrated. The image of Hephaestion&#39;s sleek silky body stretched naked on cool sheets, waiting for him, was one that burned in his mind. Hephaestion intrigued him as no other man had ever done. The boy was bold and wary, inviting and resisting, innocent and seductive all at the same time. For the first time in his life, he resented the thought of other men being in a lover&#39;s life. He wanted all of Hephaestion&#39;s time to be his. All of his kisses, all of his moans and cries of passion. He wanted Hephaestion&#39;s brilliant young mind and his intoxicating young body to be his alone. A primitive possessiveness ate at him.<br /><br />When Alexander entered the bedchamber, the image in his head became reality. Hephaestion was on his back, naked under the white pristine sheet. Hair in disarray around his face. Alexander disrobed quickly and&nbsp;climbed onto the bed.<br /><br />Hephaestion opened his eyes and watched Alexander&#39;s slow crawl up the bed where he lay waiting.<br /><br />&quot;I want you. I&#39;m going to have you.&quot; Alexander ran his hand up Hephaestion&#39;s thigh, touching the awakening phallus between his legs. He grazed his hand over Hephaestion&#39;s balls, gently rolling each of them in his hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t want another man in my bed. Because I was honest with you, you have given me grief on our first night home. I&#39;m telling you now that you have my heart. No other will ever mean anything to me.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion had to only look at the king to know that he was angry. His anger wasn&#39;t violent, but it was all the more potent for his control.<br /><br />&quot;Did you mean it when you said you might take another lover? Tell the truth, Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I.......I didn&#39;t mean it, Sire,&quot; Hephaestion stuttered. His spine felt chilled when he looked up into Alexander&#39;s narrowed eyes. There was something primitive in his expression, and when he touched Hephaestion&#39;s trembling jaw with hard lean fingers, a light touch that never the less shocked Hephaestion with it&#39;s power and possessiveness.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t share. Do you understand? I don&#39;t share. Don&#39;t ever lie to me again,&quot; Alexander rasped before leaning down to kiss his quivering lover. &quot;Kiss me,&quot; he demanded, then took the choice away by fastening his mouth on Hephaestion&#39;s. His tongue going deep to give the boy his heady taste.<br /><br />Hephaestion&#39;s eyes closed in a hot swell of pleasure. His hands clenched Alexander&#39;s shoulders. The want, the need that vibrated between them was staggering and from the pressure of Alexander&#39;s body, Hephaestion could tell he was highly aroused, yet the king seemed to be waiting for some kind of signal. When he pulled away, his face was sufficed with color and his eyes were burning.<br /><br />&quot;Do you understand, Hephaestion?&quot;<br /><br />Shuddering with effort to keep from crying, Hephaestion nodded. &quot;I understand, Alexander,&quot; he whispered.<br /><br />Relief flooded Alexander&#39;s body. He couldn&#39;t let Hephaestion know of&nbsp;his desperation. He urgently fell on his young consort, ravaging Hephaestion&#39;s mouth with more deep hard kisses.<br /><br />Hephaestion was helpless&nbsp;against the magic Alexander practiced on his flesh. He trembled as Alexander&#39;s hand again mapped out his body. His kisses had moved down Hephaestion&#39;s throat. The kings mouth sucked hard at the pulse in his neck. Crying out with the intensity of his passion, Hephaestion could do nothing but cling to Alexander&#39;s shoulders, his nails making small scratches and grooves in the strong arms that held him.<br /><br />Alexander sucked on the little hardened nipples until Hephaestion whimpered, arching his back to seek more. &quot;Easy baby,&quot; he crooned. &quot;I&#39;m going to give you what you need.&quot; A primordial instinct that he had never known he possessed made him want to brand Hephaestion as his, so no other man would ever <em>think</em> of trespassing. He straightened and reached for the oil. &quot;Get on your hands and knees, Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion quickly scrambled to do as his lover asked, wiggling his pert bottom like a cat in heat.<br /><br />Alexander smiled at the wantonness of his eager lover. He worked a generously oiled finger into Hephaestion&#39;s ass. Feeling the boy relax his muscles for penetration, he added another. Alexander touched the spot inside Hephaestion that made him writhe in pleasure.<br /><br />&quot;Please, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What, baby? We&#39;re just playing. I already fucked you tonight.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nooo,&quot; Hephaestion cried. &quot;Again.&quot; he purred, pushing back onto Alexander&#39;s fingers.<br /><br />Alexander was big, but after the initial burn, it was a feeling Hephaestion couldn&#39;t get enough of as he rocked his hips back onto Alexander&#39;s cock. It wasn&#39;t just the fullness he loved. He whimpered from joy when their balls brushed against each others. The hard slapping power of Alexander pounding against his ass, made Hephaestion push back against every thrust. When Alexander&#39;s cock would brush against the gland inside his body, Hephaestion&#39;s cries became loud.<br /><br />Reveling in the tightness of Hephaestion&#39;s pulsating entrance, Alexander&nbsp;gripped the boys hip and shoulder in a punishing hold. Hephaestion&#39;s keening cries were empowering him to thrust harder into the willing boy. So submissive in his surrender, Hephaestion was all the more beautiful. Alexander couldn&#39;t get close enough, deep enough. He buried himself deep and did a slow swiveling&nbsp;gyration against Hephaestion&#39;s ass. Reaching underneath the boy, Alexander slowly rubbed the leaking juices into the hardened shaft. He felt so good being buried in the sweet bottom that had clamped so deliciously onto his own steel like cock.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;You are so beautiful like this, Hephaestion,&quot; he groaned, running his other hand down the slick back in front of him. Every slow thrust branded the boy as his. This wasn&#39;t a simple basic physical act. It was a act of possession. Hephaestion screamed and convulsed, his orgasm exploding through him, he came and splashed on the sheets below him. A few seconds later, Alexander followed him to completion. Biting his lip to keep from crying out, Alexander thrust deep into Hephaestion, emptying his hot seed deep within the body beneath him.<br /><br />Sweaty and completely sated, Alexander fell beside Hephaestion. Pulling the boy away from the wet spot he gathered his trembling lover into his arms. Spooning up against Hephaestion&#39;s back, he nuzzled his face into the sweet damp hair before him.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;I love you, Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion murmured before falling to sleep.<br /><br />Alexander lay quietly, trying to stop his racing heart that had sped up upon hearing Hephaestion&#39;s heartfelt words.<br /><br />&quot;I love you too, baby,&quot; Alexander whispered to the sleeping boy, holding him a little bit tighter.</font><br /></p></lj-cut>"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An AU story


Hephaestion turned in his saddle to wave to his parents. Saddened by his mothers tears, he held his hand to his lips in a gesture of blowing her a kiss. Hephaestion feared never seeing his sisters grow up. Never seeing his parents grow old. Never seeing his beloved Athens again. He waved until they were out of sight and turned in his saddle to ride forward into his future.

Alexander heard the boy sniffle, trying hard to be a man and to not cry. Thankful that Bucephalus was the kind of horse that took any direction from his master, Alexander reined the horse in beside the&nbsp;chestnut gelding that Hephaestion rode, close enough to be able to take his husbands smooth hand in his own. Alexander let&nbsp;his reins go and leaned over to wipe the tears from the woebegone face. When Hephaestion looked at him with his big blue eyes, tears ready to fall, Alexander couldn&#39;t help himself. He pulled his beloved from his horse to set&nbsp;the boy&nbsp;sideways in front of him. Ignoring the startled cry, Alexander nodded to Cassander to catch the now loose gelding and rode ahead of the others in what he hoped looked like a romantic moment. He gathered his quietly weeping lover into his arms and kept riding.

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anybody this upset about leaving their family,&quot; he softly scolded his young lover. &quot;They will visit, you know.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think they will, Alexander. Father has much to do, and we are leaving for Persia. I think&nbsp;this will be the last time I see my home.&quot;

&quot;You will have a new home. With me. Are you sorry for the events that lead to your leaving of Athens?&quot;

Hephaestion rubbed his face on his lovers robe.&nbsp;Looking up at the handsome profile of the king, he felt ashamed of his dramatic emotions.

&quot;Never! I am glad to be by your side, Sire. Happy that you love me. I look forward to our adventure.&quot;

&quot;You look upon our invasion of Persia as an adventure?&quot;

&quot;I look forward to learning about the people who have&nbsp;terrorized our lands. To be able to learn from each other and help each other. It will make the world a much smaller place. I also look forward to seeing places that I have only ever read about.&quot;

Hephaestion looked at his king with excited eyes, glowing with a boy&#39;s enthusiasm.

Alexander kissed the the lips that he had fallen in love with. His beloved was leaving the mantle of boyhood behind and was finding the adventurous young man that had been lurking inside. He himself had been looking at the Persian expedition with great excitement for different reasons altogether. Now Hephaestion&#39;s youthful exhilaration gave him new goals. He didn&#39;t want to just invade. He wanted to unite for a higher purpose. Alexander looked forward to seeing the world through Hephaestion&#39;s eager eyes.

Hephaestion licked his lips, tasting the king&#39;s kiss. Not thinking about being atop of a horse and feeling safe in his lovers arms, he reached up to kiss the king back. Upon hearing his lovers moan and unmindful of the soldiers amusement, he arched into Alexander&#39;s body. Delighting in the hardness that he felt on his hip, Hephaestion turned to wrap his arms around the king.

Alexander kissed his boy one more time and leaned back to stare at the flushed face. Hephaestion could change emotions so fast, Alexander felt as if a storm had entered his life. With a flick of his wrist, he motioned for Hephaestion&#39;s horse.

&quot;Now is not the time, my love. You must learn to control yourself,&quot; he teased.

Far from being upset, Hephaestion smiled back. Secure in his kings love, and free of fear and doubt he climbed onto his own beloved horse.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you will be able to keep up to a sixteen year olds libido and run a nation at the same time, Alexander.&quot; Cleitus had noticed the erection that his king now tried to hide from display.

&quot;I am almost seventeen,&quot; Hephaestion said indignantly.

&quot;Ah yes, you are a man now,&quot; Cleitus smiled indulgently, the young lord providing him with hours of entertainment. They all enjoyed watching Alexander struggle to&nbsp;maintain the formality of his appearance around the young whirlwind.

Hephaestion laughed at Cleitus&#39;s teasing which earned him a place at their side. Hephaestion even teased back, remembering Cleitus playing with his sisters in the Mediterranean.

Amidst the laughter of his friends, Alexander rode quietly, enjoying the camaraderie of his companions and his new consort. The happiness he felt&nbsp;chilled him. This feeling never lasted in life. However when Hephaestion turned to him and smiled, he felt the warmth of love in his heart.

&quot;Hephaestion, tell me about your saddle,&quot; Cassander asked.

Hephaestion turned to the handsome general, his eyes glowing enthusiastically.

&quot;Do you like it? A very old man showed me how to do it when I was visiting my grandfather. I make them myself now. The tree that fits over the horses back is carved from hickory. It sits up to the horses withers and lays upon&nbsp;the back, beside the backbone.&quot;

Hephaestion sat back behind the saddle to better show the king and his men. Aurum, his horse was used to riding double so he never even flinched. Hephaestion pulled the decorative blanket away from the saddle.

&quot;The wood is carved so that there is room between it and the horses bone. I&#39;ve double padded it with wet leather stitched around it. It dries to conform to the wood. I put the extra blanket underneath for added protection, and I have the leather girth much like you do. Only mine keeps on the saddle and not just blankets. However I have added stirrups, that you don&#39;t use.&quot;

&quot;What are they for,&quot; Ptolemy asked. &quot;Don&#39;t you like the freedom for your feet?&quot;

Hephaestion laughed. &quot;You don&#39;t have to use them. I put them on for the games my friends and I played. I could stand high on my horses back and hit any&nbsp;target with my bow and not worry about my feet slipping off the back of my horse.&quot;

&quot;You can shoot your arrows while standing on your horse?&quot; Alexander asked, intrigued.

&quot;Yes, we used to have contests. We would also play with balls or flags. I could stand in one stirrup and avoid being hit on one side. Or I could use my feet to be able to lean over to pick something from the ground.&quot;

&quot;Your stirrups, they are too low to do the things that you speak of,&quot; pointed out Cassander.

&quot;Look, I can adjust them!&quot;

Sitting back in his saddle, Hephaestion moved his leg to lift a leather flap. Exposing a steel buckle. He moved up both stirrups to show the Macedonians how high he could stand on his horse. Taking his feet back out of the leather stirrups, he let his legs dangle.

&quot;I wish for you to show us more when we reach home, Hephaestion.&quot; Alexander exchanged looks with his three companions. Already seeing the possibilities of the saddle in the field of battle. Alexander had a big cavalry unit. One he was proud of. Anything that could help these men to victory he would use to his advantage. Anything that would lesson the peril of rider and his horse was to&nbsp;the kings&nbsp;liking.

&quot;Do you know if the Persians have these contraptions?&quot;

&quot;They might. I don&#39;t know. I have heard father say that the Persians go to battle in chariots for their cavalry unit. They have long blade-like spikes on the wheels. I&#39;m sorry, my mother wouldn&#39;t let father talk to me much of war.&quot;

&quot;You have done well, lad,&quot; Cleitus said, slapping the boy on the back. Hephaestion almost fell from the blow. After righting himself, he laughed along with the others.



Later that night Hephaestion lay in his kings arms. They were both sated from the quiet lovemaking.

&quot;I am glad we are camping out, instead of finding an inn. I always wanted to sleep under the stars.&quot;

&quot;I think you will find the kings tent much more comfortable when we journey south.&quot; Alexander held his boy closer to his body, savoring the feel of his young lover. &quot;I was proud of you today. I think you will be able to help us and I was much impressed how you listened to Cleitus talk about swords. He will&nbsp;be of much help to you. I hesitate to say that you will be actually fighting with our army though.&quot;

&quot;I can learn, Alexander. I want to be by your side.&quot;

&quot;We will see. Listen to your king now, and go to sleep. We are riding hard. I wish to be home soon.&quot;

&quot;I hope your mother likes me, Alexander. Is there anything I can say to her that would aid in our meeting?&quot; Hephaestion laid his head upon the kings shoulder, moving closer to heat of Alexander&#39;s body.

Hearing his lovers yawn, Alexander was saved from answering by the interruption of Morpheus claiming his lover.&nbsp;Glancing around the campsite, at his companions by the distant fire and his soldiers guarding their sleep, Alexander felt at peace. He held Hephaestion even closer and shut his eyes.


The kings party reached the home of an old friend of Phillips. It was late afternoon, but with Pella only a few hours ride, the party decided to stop and clean up for the night. Alexander wished for he and Hephaestion to be refreshed for the greeting of his consort to Macedon&#39;s court.

The soldiers all drifted out to the outer barns. Gifted with food and jugs of wine, Alexander was glad for the personal guard of his old friend.

After dinner the king and his companions sat comfortably on the porch of their host.

&quot;It&#39;s a good thing your father is not around, Sire. You would have had a hard time keeping Phillip away from your young consort.&quot; Draman laughed, well aware of his old kings faults when it came to young men.

Seeing the fleeting look of pain cross Cleitus&#39;s face, Alexander answered his loyal friend.

&quot;We all know that. My father never realized the things he had in life. Never appreciated those that loved him. I think he would have been surprised at Hephaestion though. Don&#39;t let his sweet nature fool you. He has a&nbsp;hidden temper.&quot;

&quot;All the better,&quot; Draman cried. &quot;A spirited boy!&quot;

The five men watched the antics of Draman&#39;s two boys play with Hephaestion and a litter of puppies. The nine and ten year old boys&nbsp;had fallen in love with Hephaestion and the three were rolling around on the grass. The puppies jumping from one boy to the other. It was an endearing sight. Sexy and sweet at the same time. Hephaestion looked so innocent and young, his inhibitions gone when playing with the puppies. Alexander wished he could join his lover. He had&nbsp;never had the chance to simply enjoy baby animals. When Hephaestion glanced up and met the eyes of the king, his face flushed with awakening passion. Alexander&#39;s heart swelled as well as his groin. Recognizing the look in the boy&#39;s eyes, he felt the familiar wave of desire for the young man.

&quot;Excuse me, I will see if Hephaestion wants to walk before we retire.&quot;

The companions smirked at each other and laughed outright when the younger boys cried to go.

Alexander held his hand out, hauling Hephaestion to his feet. The puppies clamoring over their feet.

&quot;Would you like to stroll by the stream, my love?&quot;

The two boys jumped up, both grabbing one of Hephaestion&#39;s hands and pulling him towards the stream.

Hephaestion looked back longingly at&nbsp;his king, who looked back imploringly to his host.

Draman laughed and called the boys in to ready for bed. They reluctantly handed Hephaestion over to their&nbsp;enduring king, and gathered up the puppies.

&quot;It seems I must always rescue you, beloved. So, did you enjoy playing with the puppies, my boy? You realize that you are the consort of a king now? You do not need to roll around with the children of old soldiers.&quot;

Taking the statement as a rebuke, Hephaestion flushed. &quot;I am sorry my lord.&quot;

&quot;I could see your ass outlined through those pants you insist on wearing. Looking delectable. You&#39;re lucky I didn&#39;t ravish you in front of everybody.&quot;

&quot;What was I supposed to say when the boys asked me if I wanted to see their puppies?&quot;

Alexander laughed, holding the indignant boy close&nbsp;to his side.

&quot;You smell like the puppies. Lets go bathe.&nbsp;I will have to wash you down myself.&quot;

New to the marriage bed, Hephaestion still blushed at any sexual innuendo. Much to Alexander&#39;s delight.

Eyes glowed at the thought of Alexander&#39;s soapy hands gliding over his body, soaping his wet behind, maybe fisting his phallus with the foamy substance. Hephaestion groaned.

&quot;Let&#39;s go now,&quot; he said, his voice husky with passion.

Alexander who could read his lover&#39;s mind, had the same ideas. Although he felt like torturing his consort a while longer.

&quot;We will walk first. You have to learn to control your youthful urges.&quot;

&quot;Ohh!&quot; Hephaestion felt like stomping his feet. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said, wrapping his arms around Alexander and pressing his supple body against the kings.

It was Alexander&#39;s turn to groan. But, he persevered for another minute.

&quot;I suppose I will have to get you a puppy now?&quot; Alexander loved teasing his young lover.

&quot;I like dogs, but I don&#39;t need a puppy.&quot;

&quot;No, you want a fluffy Persian kitten.&quot;

Hephaestion stopped and drew back, staring at his lover with astonished eyes.

&quot;How.........I mean.......I don&#39;t...........Ale, are you teasing me?&quot;

Alexander laughed. &quot;I heard you tell your sister that you wanted a kitten. A little kitten that you can hold and play with and sleep with,&quot; Alexander teased his blushing husband.

&quot;Shh, someone will hear you. I&#39;ll never live it down.&quot;

&quot;What? That you want a kitten?&quot; Alexander was still laughing.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Hephaestion cried. He wrestled Alexander&#39;s arm off his shoulder and turned to jump on the kings back. Alexander held Hephaestion&#39;s legs and let the boy ride piggy back for several steps.

Hephaestion leaned down to whisper in his lover&#39;s ear. &quot;I don&#39;t need a kitten. I&#39;ve got a big cat to play with now. I can hold you and sleep with you. You even purr like a cat after we..........&quot;

Hephaestion gave a little cry as Alexander gently flipped him over his shoulders to lay him&nbsp;in a gradual manner&nbsp;on the ground. Before Hephaestion knew it, he was on his back with the king straddling his legs.

&quot;I don&#39;t purr,&quot; Alexander snarled. &quot;Although, I will make you purr, kitten lover!&quot;

Their playfulness changed instantly when organs swelled, and desire billowed over them. Alexander rose and pulled Hephaestion with him. They hurried back to the others, who had sat watching the kings interesting play.

&quot;Cleitus make sure the soldiers don&#39;t drink to much. We will see you in the morning.&quot; Thanking his host for his hospitality, Alexander started to go inside. Hephaestion who still wanted his bath, whispered in the kings ear.

&quot;Draman, could you have a bath sent up?&quot;


Children ran out to greet the king. Others came from inside homes and from fields of grains and mock battles. All wanted to see the new consort of their king. It was a greeting for royalty that met them at the palace. All the soldiers had lined up outside to hail their leader. Cleitus had wanted to ride ahead and warn the court and it&#39;s soldiers to act with decorum. Alexander had overestimated his army and held his companion back. When finally reaching the palace, Alexander regretted his decision.

&quot;He&#39;s a beauty, Sire!&quot; One man shouted.

&quot;Let me be the one to treat him right, Alexander!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll show the Athenian what a Macedonian cock feels like!&quot;

&quot;Give him to me, Sire!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take him, Alexander!&quot;

&quot;Enough!&quot; Cleitus shouted. &quot;This is the consort of the king. He is loved. Anybody who shows him disrespect, disrespects our king. Anybody who harms him will not only bear the wrath of Alexander, but his companions as well. Get out! Go back to your homes. I hope a better greeting will be made tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I will talk to them, Alexander,&quot; Ptolemy said. Alexander had dismounted and was standing beside his lover who sat gripping the mane of Aurum. Both looking as if they wanted to bolt.

Hephaestion looked down upon Alexander&#39;s blond hair, noting the sunlight that shown from the tresses. He didn&#39;t understand what had just happened. He did know that it wasn&#39;t good.&nbsp; Seeing a beautiful woman walk down the steps, regal in her bearing and a snake wrapped around her neck, Hephaestion dismounted.

&quot;My son,&quot; Olympias said, hugging Alexander. She heard the whispered warning in her ear. &quot;Is this the boy,&quot; she asked haughtily

&quot;My lady, I am Hephaestion. I am so happy to finally meet you.&quot;

With no regard for the snake, Hephaestion hugged his mother in law.

&quot;You are as beautiful as Alexander said. And what a wonderful snake.&quot;

&quot;You are beautiful yourself, Hephaestion. My son must have been quite surprised at this.&quot;

&quot;I think we surprised each other.&quot; Hephaestion laughed and reached out to pet the red and black snake.

&quot;You are not scared of my baby, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Alexander or the snake, my queen?&quot;

Much to the astonishment of Alexander and his companions, Olympias laughed. An unheard of sound.

&quot;You know that the snake is a grass snake. What do you know of my son?&quot;

&quot;I know that the snake is the more harmless of the two,&quot; Hephaestion bantered.

&quot;I think you are about to find out how harmful a real snake can be,&quot; &nbsp;the queen whispered.

Bolon ran down the steps to throw his arms around Alexander. He flattened his body against the kings and rubbed suggestively.

To the chagrin of both Hephaestion and Olympias, they saw Bolon kiss the king warmly. Worse then that, Alexander didn&#39;t push the boy away.&nbsp; Hephaestion, who was still standing next to Olympias, gripped the queens hand and moved unconsciously closer to her. Olympias, feeling Hephaestion gravitate to her as if for protection against this new pain, lashed out at her son and his uninvited lover.

&quot;Young man, how dare you interrupt a family greeting,&quot; she hissed. &quot;Cleitus, see this boy out of our home and make sure he vacates his present rooms. Quickly, Cleitus,&quot; she warned.

Understanding the queens words, Cleitus, with an <em>I told you so look</em> at Alexander, pulled the boy from the kings arms and dragged him up the palace steps.

Unfortunately, Hephaestion also understood the queens words.

&quot;Alexander,&quot; Olympias said. &quot;That was an action befitting your father. I thought I was again looking at Phillip. Only this time I saw through an innocent&#39;s eyes. You owe your consort an apology.&quot; Turning to Hephaestion, she kissed the boys cheek. &quot;Be strong, Hephaestion,&quot; she whispered. Louder, she said, &quot;You will break your fast with me on the morrow, child. I wish to get to know you. And I will tell you all you need to know about the man you married. Maybe you can tell me about your ceremony?&quot;

&quot;I.........I would like that, my queen.&quot;

&quot;Call me Olympias, child,&quot; she said as she left, much to the surprise of the others. Ptolemy and Cassander quietly bid Hephaestion good night. They both would watch out for the conniving lover of the king.


Olympias swept from the courtyard to go to her rooms, dismayed that the boy had moved something inside her. She was going to greet her sons consort with aloofness and disdain. An unwelcome addition into her home. Instead she had befriended him. She had always felt great sadness when confronted with Phillips lovers. She had been able to handle it much better then the innocent child she had just met. When she felt the humiliation and unhappiness radiate from the boy, she again felt the pain from Phillip&#39;s mistreatment. When she felt the boy move closer to her for&nbsp;security as if from his own mother, she had felt a unity. In consternation, she sat down to think about the turn of events that had just happened.

Alexander watched his mother leave. She had liked Hephaestion. Had befriended him. Reaching out to take Hephaestion&#39;s arm, he felt his lover subtly turn away. He watched Hephaestion bid Cleitus goodnight. His general who had returned from inside the palace had the same air about him as his mother. Protective. Not against Bolon, but against him! Phillip&#39;s son.

Still hurt from the jeers and the salacious taunts from the soldiers, followed by the greeting of the handsome young man who was obviously still his husbands lover, Hephaestion&#39;s pain was unbearable. While following Alexander to their rooms, he wouldn&#39;t let the king touch him. The boy had reeked of heavy oils and now Alexander had the scent on him.

Upon entering the rooms they&nbsp;saw the&nbsp;hurried effort to clean the room . Several maids were changing sheets and cleaning both the sitting rooms and the sleeping room. Hephaestion saw yet another girl&nbsp;cleaning the bathroom.

&quot;Thank you, Cleitus,&quot; he whispered to himself.

Alexander pulled Hephaestion out onto the balcony, closing the doors behind him.

&quot;Baby, say something.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Hephaestion whispered brokenly. &quot;I was so happy. I feel......Why...Why were those men saying those things? Are........Are you giving me to them?&quot;

&quot;By Zeus, no! They were just being ignorant. They know the circumstances of our joining. I&#39;ll talk to them, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Who was that boy? A lover? Doesn&#39;t he know that you were leaving to be married?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, I......&quot;

&quot;He has been sleeping in this room. You were not even planning to spend my first night here together? You were going to keep seeing him, weren&#39;t you? Are you still?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, no. I will never have him again. I promise. I have made many mistakes. I am not perfect. I didn&#39;t know I was going to love you this much. It&#39;s different now.&quot;

Hephaestion wanted to cry. His whole world suddenly looked different.

&quot;Alexander, are.........are you going to be with other men?&quot;

&quot;Baby.......&quot;

&quot;Just tell me. I need to know the truth.&quot;

Alexander knew how he was when need was upon him.

&quot;I can&#39;t promise not to be with anybody else. Hephaestion, it won&#39;t mean anything. If it happens it will be just to relieve pressure.&quot;

&quot;Pressure?&nbsp; You mean if I am across the courtyard or lunching with your mother? Or if I am with your companions for the hours of training you set up for me?&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t be like that! You don&#39;t understand the difficulties of running an empire. Now we are going to war. We will be many years on a difficult campaign. We will often have to be away from each other. I will never intentionally hurt you, Hephaestion. You will always be the one I wish to be with.&quot;

Hephaestion thought about what the king was saying. Not hurt him? Just the words were causing him anguish.

&quot;So does that mean that when you are away and need to relieve your body&#39;s tension, it is alright for me to do the same?&quot;

In two strides, Alexander had Hephaestion&#39;s upper arms tightly in his grasp.

&quot;You will not take any other lovers, Hephaestion! It is not allowed.&quot;

&quot;I have learned what is Macedonian law, Alexander. I asked a friend of my fathers when I went into Athens. I didn&#39;t want to ever embarrass you. I read that your law states that a wife must be chaste, while a consort has no such rule.&quot;

&quot;I am the king, Hephaestion. I make the laws.&quot;

&quot;If you can not control your body&#39;s needs, then why must I?&quot;

&quot;Enough of this! I will allow you no others, Hephaestion. I hope you jest, my love. You will not like the consequences if you do not.&quot;

&quot;You will not know, you will be away.&quot;

Angered at his lovers words, Alexander dragged Hephaestion into the bedroom. Yelling at the maids who just finishing cleaning to get out, he threw Hephaestion onto the bed.

&quot;I will kill any that touch you, Hephaestion. &quot;

Ripping the clothes from Hephaestion&#39;s body, Alexander held the boy down. He was strong, but he was not trained.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you,&quot; Hephaestion cried. His anger and fear making him tremble with frustration. He hated the heat that rose in his body when feeling the touch of his king.

&quot;You do want me and that scares you. You will fight your own body&#39;s need, for fear of appearing weak. You will enjoy what your body is meant for, Hephaestion. <em>My</em> touch. <em>My</em> violation. No other. You were meant for a king. No other will touch what belongs to Alexander.&quot;

Alexander reached over and coated his fingers with oil from a bowl on his night table. Placing two at Hephaestion&#39;s puckered entrance, he gently pushed inside. He didn&#39;t move his fingers. He just let them stay inside his lover, getting him used to the fullness that would soon follow. Making him crave his kings body. Making Hephaestion need him with the same intensity that he needed Hephaestion. Pulling his fingers out and wiping them on the bed, he leaned down to kiss his lover. Alexander&#39;s lips ravaged Hephaestion&#39;s face, and then he was kissing him. His tongue plunging deeply. The full force of his passion released in an explosion of longing in the younger man.&nbsp;Standing to tear off his own clothes, He watched Hephaestion&#39;s eyes darken. Swiping his phallus with the oil, he raised&nbsp;his lover&#39;s&nbsp;legs to rest upon his shoulders.

&quot;You are mine. I have told you this. Say it. Say it!&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes. Yours. Please, Alexander.&quot;

When Alexander slowly entered Hephaestion mere seconds later, he brought forth a moan from deep within Hephaestion&#39;s body. Alexander started to thrust much more roughly. The sensation he was creating inside Hephaestion&#39;s body was causing the boy to cry out. Alexander began to undulate his torso in the most delightful way. Not completely withdrawing, but grinding his hips against Hephaestion&#39;s ass instead. His pleasure spot was hit repeatedly. When Alexander touched his weeping organ, rubbing his own wetness over it as he pulled on it gently, Hephaestion could take no more. He climaxed almost immediately, unknowingly raising his hips to slam into Alexander&#39;s thrust, bringing a cry from the kings own mouth. Hephaestion could feel the&nbsp;pulsing of the kings orgasm deep inside his body. This kept his own sweet throbbing alive and lasting much longer then Hephaestion thought possible.

Hephaestion felt his limbs being lowered and opened his eyes to see the king watching him.

&quot;You are so beautiful, Hephaestion. I love watching you spend in my arms.&quot;

&quot;You watch me?&quot;

&quot;It is a part of my pleasure.&quot;

&quot;I will try it the next time I make love.&quot;

&quot;You will drive me crazy, looking into your incredible eyes as you reach your peak.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it won&#39;t be your eyes, Sire,&quot; Hephaestion said quietly.</font></div>"

Do I <em>have</em> to wake to see you three peering down at me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We wanted to have coffee with you before you shackled yourself,&quot; Ptolemy laughed. &quot;Come on, a servant has your bath ready.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Coffee again? I spend a fortune having tea shipped in and it's coffee these Athenians drink? Zeus, am I glad it's a small ceremony. I feel quite ill.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's nerves,&quot; Cleitus said. &quot;I felt the same way, the first time I was forced to marry.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I do not have nerves,&quot; Alexander retorted, swinging his legs to the side of the bed. &quot;And as I recall, Father told me he had to drag you kicking and screaming. At least I am happy with my union.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, I would've been too, if I had gotten a boy like Hephaestion. Your father shackled me with a long toothed woman, ten&nbsp;years my senior!&quot;<br /><br />Cassander laughed at a red faced Cleitus. Indeed Alexander looked quite pale.<br /><br />&quot;Get in your bath, Alexander. We'll wait in the outer room. You did remember to think about what you wanted to say?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's a male bonding ceremony. Not a traditional wedding. You have to say something. Eumenes told you this before you came down here.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I remember, I remember. For the love of Zeus, leave me alone!&quot;<br /><br />Alexander sank into the deep bath after chasing a servant from the bathing area. He knew those three were trying to make him nervous. He could see the laughter in their eyes. It's not like he didn't want to join with Hephaestion. On the contrary, he wanted it very much. However, it was becoming nerve racking. Between his generals, his mother in law, and Hephaestion's desires, Alexander was wrought with tension. He wished he could skip the ceremony, and just leave with Hephaestion. And then he remembered his lover's excitement at the beach yesterday.<br /><br />Hephaestion had been upset that his grandfather was unable to attend, the only other family the boy had other then immediate. Amnitor had told Alexander that the cantankerous old man was just being difficult because of his views on male bondings. Alexander thought it was sad that he wouldn't come to see his grandson for what was probably the last time. The king made it a point to listen to Hephaestion's excessive enthusiasm about their upcoming nuptials, while he&nbsp;had watched his young lover swim and frolic in the water. Hephaestion was like a water sprite the way he swam. If it wasn't for the fact that they needed to be together, he thought that Hephaestion would be suited in the navy of Nearchus. Feeling Hephaestion's wet and slippery skin against his had aroused him to feverish pitch. He abstained from anything sexual, much to the disappointment of his irresistible and ardurous lover. But they&nbsp;did have&nbsp;fun swimming in Hephaestion's sea together. And watching Cleitus and Cassander in the water with two young girls wrestling on their shoulders, or on their backs being taken for rides had proven to be great entertainment. With Ptolemy on the shore yelling for them to not be out so far, it had provided Alexander with embarrassing stories to tell for years.<br /><br />The king sighed, musing done for now. He had better wash and get ready for his ceremony. Calling the servant back in to wash his hair and dress him in his royal clothes, Alexander put his mind to what he wanted to say. Something short would be best he thought, as he called for Ptolemy to bring him a cup of the rich brew favored by his lover.<br /><br /><br />The courtyard had been raked and the grass sheared. Flowers grew in the beds and more had been brought in to be placed in large vases. The soldiers of Alexander, wearing the light armor and&nbsp;red cape of Macedon were lined up on the side of Alexander. Several nobles and generals of Athens lined on the side of Hephaestion. Standing in front of the stone and marble alter were the companions and family of the two grooms. As highest noble in the land, it would be Amnitor himself who would say the words that would join his son to a king.<br /><br />Waiting at the end of an aisle that would lead to the alter, Alexander's eyes went to the door that Hephaestion came through. Both of them ran their eyes over the other, drinking in the sight of wedding robes and crowns. Hephaestion's breath caught at the regal splendor that was Alexander. Velvet red and gold robes adorned his proud body. A gold crown, heavy with the jewels of a king made Hephaestion feel as if he were marrying a god. Alexander's heart beat hard and rhythmically against his chest. Hephaestion wore a short white chiton in Macedonian style, covered by a diaphanous blue robe. Even the string on his sandals were blue, tying up over the calf of his legs, drawing Alexander's eyes to the smooth thighs that were bare to his view. A headband like crown was worn with the ribbons of both their houses. Blue forget me nots were strung&nbsp; between the ribbons. Alexander would later have rubies and sapphires placed on the crown of his consort. But for now the ribbons and flowers made Hephaestion look sweetly innocent. He was all boy, yet he had such a breathtaking beauty that was almost androgynous. Placing his hand in Alexander's, Hephaestion smiled at his king and was led down to the alter. The two carried unlit candles, which they lit from a larger candle that sat on the alter&nbsp;and placed them in holders beside each other.<br /><br />&quot;Countrymen of Greece,&quot; Celeas Amnitor began, &quot;we have come together in celebration of the legal joining of our cultures and our lands. A male bonding of knowledge, strength, and wisdom that is Alexander, King of Macedonia. He has given Athens her pride. In return, Athens gives him in joining, one of their&nbsp;sweetest treasures.&quot;<br /><br />Looking to the two grooms and again out to his people, Amnitor began the next part of the ceremony.<br /><br />&quot;Like a stone, should your love be firm. Like a star, should your love be constant. Let the powers of the mind and of the intellect guide you in your marriage. Let the strength of your wills&nbsp;bind you together. Let the power of love and desire make you happy and the strength of your dedication make you inseparable.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;As the highest leader in Athens it is my privilege to give my son to our new king. Hephaestion, do you join with Alexander of your own free will?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is my wish,&quot; said Hephaestion, peeking shyly up at his lover.<br /><br />&quot;King Alexander, is it your wish to join with the son of Athens?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is my wish,&quot; said Alexander clearly.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Then the royal ring will be switched from the right hand to be worn on the left hand and on the third finger. It is this reason that the vein of life runs from that finger to your heart. Do you have a ring for your consort?<br /><br />&quot;I do.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Then, please place it on his left hand.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander took off the ring that he had worn on his middle finger since his fathers death. It was the ring of Phillip and had a place of honor in Macedonia. It was big for Hephaestion, but his goldsmiths would take care of that.<br /><br />&quot;King Alexander, I have not the power to bind you until you say. If it is your wish, say yes and place your hand over Hephaestion's.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is my wish,&quot; Alexander said, holding the hand of his beloved. He stared into the bright blue eyes, smiling softly when he detected the hint of tears.<br /><br />&quot;Then with the ribbons of our two nations, I bind you together. The colors of red and gold are wrapped over the colors of blue and white. Your hands will remain bound together during the remainder of the ceremony as a symbol of your joining. It is customary in a male union to say a vow to each other. Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will put my heart in your hands, and trust you to hold it dear. Trust me with your heart, and I will guard it with my life. I will be your comfort when the duties of king's burdens are heavy. I thank Zeus for bringing my souls mate into my life, and my father for making it happen. I am yours.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alexander, do you have words?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Like our hands, our souls are entwined. Separate lives that we will live together. Five days ago we met. And I have waited for you forever. Everything I have is yours. I will care for your heart, for it is priceless. I will shelter you in my arms and keep you safe. You are mine to love and I give&nbsp;my love&nbsp;freely.&quot;<br /><br />Lord Amnitor poured a golden chalice with his richest harvest of wine. Handing the vessel to Alexander who in return held it to Hephaestion's lips before taking his own sip.<br /><br />&quot;Alexander, ruler of Macedonia, king of Greece I give to you Hephaestion Amnitor, son of Athens as your consort in marriage. Congratulations.&quot;<br /><br />Cheers erupted on both sides of the grooms. The sisters of Hephaestion threw rose petals on the couple, laughing in joy with their brother. Hugs were given to the bound couple. More wine was poured for everybody and set out in pitchers that were filled constantly. Toasts were made and accepted. Ribald and off color jokes were made by the men concerning the wedding night. Dinner was eaten and enjoyed by all. In the short time she had, Lady Amnitor had done Athens proud and basked in the praise from the exuberant Macedonians.<br /><br />Alexander and Hephaestion shared the goblet of wine as well as a plate of food. In years to come they would look back at the small ceremony with happiness, but right then all they wanted was to be alone. Hephaestion had wondered and thought about this night for days. His passion for Alexander was smoldering in his youthful loins. Alexander's lust bordered on craving. He hungered for his young consort. The sexual heat radiating from Hephaestion set off sparks inside Alexander. The king signaled for a servant to cut their bindings, asking him to save them for Hephaestion's mother. He then ordered a full bath for his lover, telling him to say his good-byes<br /><br />Hephaestion made a quick round, saying good-bye to his friends and other Athenian nobles. His sisters he would see in a months time. That would be the the last and hardest good-bye. His parents he thanked, telling them he would see them early in the morning to say their farewells.<br /><br />A half hour later, Alexander made the same rounds. He was clasped by his generals and more bawdy jesting was made.<br /><br />Finally Alexander was able to enter the coolness of his rooms, only to stop dead at the vision that beheld him.&nbsp;His lover&nbsp;stood beside the bed, naked except for a thin sheet wrapped around his body. Letting the sheet fall to his feet, Hephaestion shivered at the tingling&nbsp;that coursed&nbsp;through his body.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander could feel his manhood springing to life beneath the robes that he wore. Throbbing in anticipation, he flew to his lover, molding his mouth to the younger mans.&nbsp;Feeling the frenzied boy in his arms, he knew Hephaestion would not last. This first time he would have to be fast.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;You are so sensitive to my touch, so beautiful I fear you are not real.&quot; Alexander moved his mouth sensuously against Hephaestion's neck, softly biting the vein that was pulsing.&nbsp; The boy's cry was sharp and agonized. Pushing Hephaestion on to the bed he moved to take the boy's cock into his mouth. Deciding to let his husband have a taste of his own leaking phallus, he moved into a different position. He knew it would not&nbsp;be an expert handling, but he&nbsp;ached to feel the boys wet mouth wrapped around his shaft.<br /><br />&quot;Just put the head in your mouth, and move your tongue if you can. You can learn later. Watch your teeth.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander moaned when the ravenous boy attached himself to his aching manhood. Not expert. Better then that, an innocent hunger surpassing anything he had ever experienced. Alexander found himself wanting to thrust into the boys&nbsp;hot cavern&nbsp;before remembering to take the hard shaft into his own mouth. Hollowing his cheeks, he sucked the boy to the root receiving a moan that vibrated through his own cock. Returning the vibrating moan he sucked and swirled his tongue around the boys head. His hands simultaneously squeezed the boys bottom and played with his full balls. It was just a moment more before Hephaestion pulled his mouth away to cry out his pleasure, his orgasm exploding inside Alexander's mouth. Alexander swallowed the copious amounts of fluid, savoring his lover's taste.<br /><br />Still trembling from the raw force of his climax, Hephaestion again put his mouth to Alexander's groin.<br /><br />Alexander didn't dare to move much. He didn't want to choke the boy. Feeling a tentative hand stroking his length and another touching his balls, Alexander moaned his approval. The boy was a natural.<br /><br />&quot;Oh gods, I'm coming. Hephaestion. I...........&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion tried to swallow all of Alexander's seed. He wanted to, but it came so fast and he choked on the throbbing head of his lover's phallus. Sniffling a little, he tried to put his mouth back on it to gather the rest of the fluid when he felt Alexander turn around and gather him in his arms.<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry.&nbsp;I tried to.........&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Shh, you were wonderful for the first time. Never has any mouth felt so warm and good on my body.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You'll let me try again?&quot;<br /><br />Alexander laughed. Only his lover would ask something like that.<br /><br />&quot;Anytime, baby.&quot; Hephaestion was so adorable in his passion that Alexander felt an overwhelming desire to kiss him. Even after reaching orgasm, Alexander was still on fire to&nbsp;posses his potent lover. Standing to disrobe fully, he watched Hephaestion's eyes darken with renewed desire. Watching the heat flood through Hephaestion's young body, Alexander's manhood was already starting to thrust boldly forward.<br /><br />Leaning down he slipped his tongue&nbsp;between&nbsp;Hephaestion's lips, letting their combined tastes mingle within their mouths. He kissed the boy with two days worth of pent up passion.<br /><br />Hephaestion felt himself being rolled onto his stomach. Figuring that Alexander was going to take him now, he moaned when the king started to kiss down his back.<br /><br />Alexander raised his lovers hips and put his hands to the boys cheeks. Parting the quivering mounds, he looked at the almost virgin entrance. His mouth watered at the delectable sight and craving to try his lovers taste, Alexander licked up the cleft of Hephaestion's body. He pointed his tongue and prodded at the small hole. Circling around and then pushing gently inside.<br /><br />Hephaestion jumped on feeling the first lick. Crying out, he tried to turn from the intense feeling only to have Alexander hold him still.&nbsp; Again he felt his desire for the king overwhelm his body.<br /><br />Alexander knew he couldn't feast for long. &nbsp;The joys of sex being to new for the young man to take for long. Looking around and spying a vial of oil on the bedside table, he coated both his fingers and phallus.<br /><br />Hephaestion's hips were thrusting back wildly against him, firing his passion to thrust into&nbsp;his wanton husband. He quickly prepared his lover, twisting his fingers inside his hot tight hole. He bent to taste the sweat on Hephaestion's neck, sucking gently before&nbsp;pushing his manhood into the heated entrance. He thrust deep as Hephaestion screamed. Alexander waited and breathed deeply, sweat dripping onto Hephaestion's back. The king groaned as Hephaestion started to push back onto the hard shaft embedded in his body. And he started to fuck his boy. Pushing his shoulders to the mattress and holding his hips, Alexander thrust and rotated his hips, rubbing against&nbsp;the boys pleasure gland&nbsp;until Hephaestion was a trembling mass of need. The boy was moaning and begging and Alexander was sure the others would hear if they had come back from the party. Reaching around to stroke Hephaestion's weeping manhood, Alexander molded himself to his lover's back. Rocking against the slick body, Alexander was in ecstacy. He would have liked to prolong his own pleasure,&nbsp;but the throbbing pulsations he felt within Hephaestion's body were his undoing. Grinding his hips fiercely against his lovers ass he joined him in orgasm, spilling his seed deep inside his husbands body, falling to rest on Hephaestion's trembling form.<br /><br />After a moment he rose to gather wet toweling. Noticing that the bath was still full, he dunked himself. He washed quickly before going back to clean his sated boy. Hephaestion moaned when he felt the cool damp cloth on his heated body.<br /><br />Sitting up he tried to take the towels.<br /><br />&quot;Shh, let me clean you,&quot; Alexander whispered.<br /><br />Throwing the towel on the slate floor, Alexander climbed into the bed with his consort. His heart warmed when he felt Hephaestion snuggle into his body. Tipping the beautiful flushed face back, Alexander kissed the soft lips.<br /><br />&quot;Your mine, my husband,&quot;&nbsp;Alexander stated possessively, holding his&nbsp;beloved close.<br /><br />&quot;Yours,&quot; Hephaestion agreed, before closing his eyes to sleep for the first time with his king.<br /><br /></font></div>"

Alexander asked, when entering the outer rooms. He could see some of his soldiers outside. They appeared to be talking to some of the household staff of Lord Amnitor.<br /><br />""The servants made coffee today. Amnitor has it shipped from Egypt. One of the few suppliers he has left, it would seem."" Ptolemy had answered his king while already pouring the man a cup of the rich brew. He added cream and just a bit of honey, the same way Alexander took his tea.<br /><br />Alexander absent mindedly took a sip of the strong hot liquid as he watched the doings of his soldiers. Cleitus smiled when he saw the king frown and take another sip.<br /><br />""Coffee?"" Alexander turned with an inquiring look on his face. ""Why am I drinking this?""<br /><br />""Lady Amnitor asked her servants to make us some,"" Ptolemy answered. ""I think it's good.&nbsp;Lord Amnitor&nbsp;trades wine for the beans that make the brew.""<br /><br />""It's Hephaestion's favorite drink,"" Cleitus added with a smirk. ""His mother has arranged for several boxes of the stuff to be sent north with us. Along with all his possessions.""<br /><br />""Is that what they are doing out there?"" Alexander rubbed at the ache in his head. He had been up for most of what had remained of his night, thinking about Hephaestion. And now this?<br /><br />""What do you mean, all his possessions?"" he asked.&nbsp;""He doesn't need to take anything. I can provide my lover with whatever he may need. Coffee? She's sending coffee?""<br /><br />""Most <em>brides </em>bring their things to their new home, Alexander,"" Cleitus laughed when his king glared at him for calling Hephaestion his bride. ""Really Alexander, it's for his mother as well. She wants to make sure her son is happy. Let him have his things. He's leaving his home and most likely will never come back here again.""<br /><br />""He is just a boy,"" Ptolemy said quietly.<br /><br />Alexander nodded, sobered by the thought.<br /><br />""Is there any more of that brew left?"" Cassander asked, coming in from the outside. ""Joy to you, Sire. Lady Amnitor asked me to tell you to make sure Hephaestion doesn't drink much of&nbsp;the coffee&nbsp;at night. She says it makes him hyper. She's going to be telling you how to take care of her baby until we are out of her sight, I think.""<br /><br />""I don't think it's the coffee,"" Alexander bemoaned.&nbsp;""I think it's him! I still can't get over what he pulled last night.""<br /><br />""The boy wanted to go swimming one last time,"" Ptolemy said on behalf of the boy and his friends. ""It's no more then what we used to do. We would get ourselves into some tough situations.""<br /><br />""Yes, but we were able to get ourselves out. Most of the time,"" Alexander said with a grin, directed at Cleitus. ""Hephaestion is like a babe.""<br /><br />""Alexander, his father isn't much better,"" Cleitus said. ""He's no more equipped to protect his land then Aristotle is. I think he is a wonderful man and his hearts in the right place, but he is a nobleman not a soldier. His city and his lands are perfect. But defense? He needs help.""<br /><br />""I'll find a retired general who is willing to come down here. As a defense adviser of course. These people still own their own lands.""<br /><br />""Alexander, Lord Amnitor told us he has ships patrolling the sea,"" Cassander added. He was still upset about the lack of security for Athens sons and daughters. ""These people were great sailors once, I think over the years they have lost that edge. That slaver ship sailed right into the palace harbor. I know they would have climbed the palace walls and stolen Hephaestion right from his bed. They must have thought it was their lucky day to see those boys cavorting on the beach last night.""<br /><br />""I thought of that. I'm sending Nearchus down with a steward and now a general. He can stay and give the sailors some tips in defending their coast. It should help until we can put a stop to the slavers. I wish we could have captured that ship last night. I look forward to meeting Bessos on the field of battle.""<br /><br />""Men like him, they run from the field of battle,"" Cleitus spat.<br /><br />""I'm going to kill him,"" Alexander said dangerously. ""Twice he has tried to hurt what is mine. If I have to chase him to the four corners of the Persian empire, I <em>will </em>kill him.""<br /><br />""We're with you, Alexander.""<br /><br />Alexander sat down and poured himself another cup of the rich coffee, this time leaving out the honey. He felt pathetically closer to his betrothed while drinking it.<br /><br />""Between the four of us, I have become quite enamored of my intended consort."" Alexander continued, ignoring the knowing looks of his generals. ""As much as I love his endearing ways, last night brought home to me how innocent and unprepared Hephaestion is for entering Macedon. Let alone following an army across Asia.""<br /><br />""What are you going to do,Alexander?"" Ptolemy knew to tread carefully when Alexander's boy was concerned.<br /><br />""I don't want him to become hard. And truthfully, unless something terrible happens to him, I think he will always retain most of his sweetness. He needs to protect himself though. He needs to be able to be a useful part of our army. Interestingly enough, his father told me that the boy is an excellent archer. He has beaten boys and men alike in tournament. He even has many sets of bows and makes his own arrows. It was his mother who wouldn't let him put his skill to practical use.""<br /><br />""We can use good archers, Alexander.,"" Ptolemy said, excited at the prospect.<br /><br />""When we get home, you can direct him in the proper use of an archer, Ptolemy. His father also told me he is an accomplished rider. If he insists on growing up and being a part of a fighting army, then I want him beside me in the cavalry. I will need your help, Cassander. Watch him on the ride home. Cleitus, I want you to teach him to use a sword. And teach him to fight. Set a couple hours out each day for him. And for my sake, don't let him get to hurt. I would like to enjoy his smooth skin for awhile longer,"" Alexander grinned. ""I will be helping him with these things also. I just want him to learn direction from other soldiers. And not have his lover telling him constantly what to do.""<br /><br />""Except in bed,"" Cassander leered.<br /><br />""Teach him your herbs, Alexander,"" Cleitus reminded his king. ""It is good for any man to have the gift of healing.""<br /><br />""You want to leave for Persia in two months, Sire. He can not learn all this in that time,"" Ptolemy warned. ""It took us years.""<br /><br />""We had other education in that time also. Hephaestion has already had that. He will have to learn while we journey. In nine days time he turns seventeen. You can start with him after that. Until then, he is mine. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;show him around Macedon and give us a chance to&nbsp;get to know each other. We will not have time like this again.""<br /><br />""Enjoy your love for a few days, Alexander,"" Cleitus said softly. ""You were very lucky to find such a rare treasure. I know you are king, and you are getting impatient to rule the world, but&nbsp;don't ever let the glitter of being king let you forget the gem you have in your hand.""<br /><br />""I won't, Cleitus. But why are you saying these things to me?""<br /><br />""Because I want to talk to you about Bolon.""<br /><br />Alexander was quiet. He leaned back in his seat and contemplated his companion.<br /><br />""What about him?""<br /><br />""I don't want you to treat Hephaestion like your father treated me. I don't want you to treat Bolon like your father treated Pausanias.""<br /><br />""I would never hurt either of them like that.""<br /><br />""No, not the same way. I know that. Unintentionally, both of them are going to be hurt though. And I don't want Bolon to treat you to what Pausanias treated your father too. Pausanias didn't have anybody except your father to take his anger out on. Bolon might see Hephaestion as the person in his way of being in the bed of the king.""<br /><br />""Cleitus, these thoughts, they scare me.'<br /><br />""They're meant too. Bolon has been almost a steady bed mate of yours for a year now. Are you giving him up?""<br /><br />""This is none of your business.""<br /><br />""""Yes it is, Alexander,"" the kindly Ptolemy snapped. ""You have been fucking this boy and you don't see him the way we do. I like Hephaestion. I don't want to see him hurt.""<br /><br />""You are not trying to tell your king he must be faithful to his consort are you?""<br /><br />""No, we unfortunately know you won't be. But for Hephaestion's sake, be circumspect about it.""<br /><br />""Alright, alright. I already told Bolon I was joining with a boy from Athens.""<br /><br />""I bet you also told Bolon that nothing would change, didn't you?""<br /><br />Alexander was quiet.<br /><br />""You told everybody who would listen that you were being forced to marry the son of Athens so that you could save your people from going to war. You told people how ugly the boy must be to be a virgin at sixteen. You even told your men that as long as they were kind, that you would welcome a lover for Hephaestion. You set the tone for what your consort is walking into, and yet&nbsp;you sit there so defensively about Bolon. Didn't you just tell us that you loved the boy? Don't be like your father, Alexander.""<br /><br />""Shut up! Enough! I will see that Hephaestion comes to no harm, and I will see that Bolon knows that our relationship is over. Are you happy now?""<br /><br />""I only think of the health of the house of Alexander, my king.""<br /><br />""Oh quit being humble, you old fool. Is this what I can expect? You three mother hens making sure that Hephaestion is happy? Fine then! Go get your loin cloths and your robes on. We are taking Hephaestion and his sisters swimming.""<br /><br />""What?""<br /><br />""No!""<br /><br />""Alexander, we are not babysitting, while you hump your lover in the sea!""<br /><br />""Alexander, you know I don't swim well,"" Ptolemy cried.<br /><br />""You can stay close to the beach with the little girls,"" Cassander laughed<br /><br />""Be quiet, Cassander. You have to watch one of the girls too.""<br /><br />""Unlike you, I like to swim.""<br /><br />""Generals, you are the ones who said that <em>poor Hephaestion just wanted to go swimming.</em> And you also told me how <em>poor Hephaestion may never come back to his home again. </em>So lets go up to the main house and gather our charges. Just for an hour or two. That's an order. Be ready in one half hour.""<br /><br />Alexander chuckled to himself to hear his grumbling companions. It would be good for them to play with children and forget war for awhile. Alexander had already arranged for six of his soldiers to watch the horizon from the rim. Since he was dressed for the water already, Alexander sat back and contemplated what the men had to say.<br /><br />As prince, Alexander could have any man or woman he wanted. And he tried both. After the death of his father he had servants, pages, maids, even noble men and women throwing themselves at the new young king. He had fought in Thebes to find even the young people of his greatest enemies to date wanted to bed him. Not Alexander, but King Alexander. Bolon had been different. Whether he had been smarter and knew how to play Alexander as his companions suggested, Alexander didn't know. He did know that he soon tired of the constant round of bodies. He wanted something more. and Bolon had offered what he could. The boy was only a year older then Hephaestion, yet years older in experience. He had gotten used to the boy in his bed and in his rooms and Bolon might have gotten used to it also. It just seemed as if one day he was always around. He had never promised the boy anything though, and Bolon would have to be told that Hephaestion was the most important thing in his life now. He would also have to let people know quickly that Hephaestion was off limits. He hoped his boy never found out about the things Alexander said about him before he even knew him.<br /><br /><br />After arranging to meet his men on the beach, he arranged to have servants bring drinks and snacks for the children, young and old alike. He was grateful that Lady Amnitor was in the gardens directing the small army of servants to have everything just right for her sons&nbsp;joining tomorrow. His own marriage ceremony,&nbsp;Alexander thought. He wished he had brought his mother to witness his nuptials. At the time, he scoffed at the male bonding ritual and so had his mother, grateful that she wasn't losing her son to a bride.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hephaestion had been wronged. He deserved to have the support of Macedon. Alexander decided then and there that when his in laws came to visit in a months time he would have a Macedonian ceremony for his beloved.<br /><br />""He's still sleeping, son."" Amnitor had come into the hall from another door. ""Why don't you go wake him up before Callie comes back into the hall. The twins are to young for the sea but I'll have Dani and Tania ready for when you come down. This is a good thing you are doing, Sire. It will be a fond memory for my kids,""&nbsp;<br /><br />""He will get back here someday, Celeas."" Even as Alexander said the words, he knew it was doubtful.<br /><br />""One can always have hope, Sire. Go on now, go wake your betrothed.""<br /><br />The light was shining in Hephaestion's spacious rooms. Alexander deliberately didn't look at his sleeping lover. He saw the packed bags, ready for travel. Saw the marriage tunic and robes that Hephaestion would wear. They were in the colors of the house of Amnitor. A crown lay on the dresser, ready for flowers to be put in it, ribbons were already wrapped through it. Ribbons the color of both their houses. Alexander turned away, guilty that he had seen Hephaestion's joining finery. He couldn't wait to see his beautiful lover in his clothes. Alexander had seen Hephaestion dressed like a servant, dressed in his favorite togas, but never the regal clothes of his people.<br /><br />Turning away from the marriage clothes, Alexander wandered out to the balcony. Looking down onto the courtyard, Alexander realized how far up it was. The boy had climbed down the wall last night with no fear of the height. Alexander would have to be more careful in the future. Hephaestion would try anything in the army, long before he was ready.<br /><br />Finally he turned back to his lover. Hephaestion lay sprawled on his stomach. Alexander smiled at the sight. It was a good thing he had a big bed at home.&nbsp;He sat on the edge of the bed, his breathing had started to get a bit heavier. Hephaestion was naked, with only a sheet twisting around his legs. Before reaching out to touch his boy, Alexander drank his fill. He didn't have much time, people were waiting. His eyes wandered down from the golden toned back to a very slim waist. Alexander couldn't wait to span the waist again, to hold the boy close to his body. Alexander actually found himself licking his lips at the sight of Hephaestion's rounded behind. Hairless&nbsp;soft skin, taut over muscled cheeks. Alexander ran his&nbsp;fingers lightly over the twin&nbsp;mounds, slipping his hand in the shadowed cleft, reveling in the heat emanating from his boy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hephaestion moaned and rolled over, dislodging the delicious feeling from his bottom. Opening his eyes and blinking twice he moaned his sires name.<br /><br />""Alexander?"" Hephaestion asked, not quite believing his eyes.<br /><br />""You were expecting somebody else?"" Alexander chuckled at Hephaestion's sleepy look. He looked so adorable and desirable. His big blue eyes blinking up at him, his hair tousled around his face. Alexander had never seen a more beautiful sight. He watched the transformation of warm sleepy boy to waking seductive siren. Saw Hephaestion's body automatically move closer to his own. Alexander caressed the smooth chest, tweaking a nipple, before running his hand over the thin trail of silky hair leading to Hephaestion's aching phallus.&nbsp;The boy&nbsp;whimpered and arched into&nbsp;his hand.<br /><br />""Alexander, please,"" he sighed.<br /><br />""""What, baby?""<br /><br />""Do you want to.....?""<br /><br />""Do I want to what?"" Alexander continued to rub his hand teasingly over the quivering body. He felt the firm thighs. Slim and shapely. He couldn't wait to to lay between them, feeling them lift to wrap around his waist.<br /><br />""You.....you could come inside me again.""<br /><br />""I want nothing more then to <em>come </em>inside you. But I want to wait for our wedding night.""<br /><br />Hephaestion moaned. Alexander's hand was still tracing patterns on his sensitive skin.<br /><br />""you could kiss me...there."" Hephaestion leaned up to reach for Alexander, the light in his feverish eyes shining bright. ""Or.......I could kiss you there. Oh please&nbsp;let me, Alexander.""<br /><br />Alexander marveled at the boys excitement at the thought of pleasuring his lover. Once again Alexander felt lucky and humbled to be the fortunate one to be the recipient of Hephaestion's awakening passions.&nbsp;The young man&nbsp;was trembling in anticipation, ripe for any loving. The king opened his robe and lowered his loin cloth. He laid down on the bed and rolled Hephaestion to lay on top of him, aligning their cocks so that they collided with each other. He looked up at his eager young lover.<br /><br />""We'll save those things for tomorrow night. Just rub on me baby, until we hit our peak. Kiss me.""<br /><br />He knew Hephaestion wouldn't last long. The boy was so new to his body's enjoyment and he was to far gone. When Hephaestion lowered his lips to touch Alexander's, the king lapped at the boy's tongue. He tasted good, even after sleeping. He must have ate something after the big swimming scare. Apples. He tasted like apples.&nbsp;Hephaestion moaned into Alexander's mouth, the sensation engulfing him. The king&nbsp;could feel&nbsp;his lover's&nbsp;impending orgasm as the boy took control of their pace.<br /><br />Wrapping his arms around the king as much as he could, Hephaestion lowered his head to bury his face in Alexander's moist neck, breathing in the manly smell of his lover. He loved how Alexander held him gently, letting him grind his own throbbing shaft against the searing heat of Alexander's.&nbsp; Feeling their bodies slip and slide while being ground together, Hephaestion vibrated in pleasure. His body gave one last thrust against Alexander's, and he came in an almost devastating orgasm.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander held Hephaestion tightly. The boys cry against his neck and his rapturous climax, triggered Alexander's own release. He smiled when Hephaestion lifted his head and glowed triumphantly. Alexander rolled him back under his body. For a moment he took back his dominate position, before kissing his lover tenderly and sitting up. He wiped both their bodies with the sheet that was now tangled on the bed.<br /><br />""Get dressed. My men and your sisters are waiting for your lazy bones.""<br /><br />""I'm not lazy! I was up all night,"" Hephaestion cried indignantly. ""Why, where are we going?"" He asked after a moments thought.<br /><br />""Swimming. I want to swim in the sea before we go home.""<br /><br />""Really?"" Hephaestion beamed at him in high spirited happiness.<br /><br />""Hurry up."" Alexander laughed at Hephaestion's enthusiasm as he hurried to get dressed. He rushed to the bathroom, shyly shutting the door behind him, emerging&nbsp;moments later in a toga like swimming suit. Alexander couldn't wait for tomorrow night.<br /><br /><br /></font></div>"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an Alternate Universe story


Hephaestion opened his eyes. The king was on his back with Hephaestion&#39;s head upon his shoulder. The arms of his lover held him tight, and to Hephaestion the feeling was wonderful. He was a little sore, but decided he liked the feeling. Other then that his body felt alive, and the emotions he felt bordered on contentment and intense joy. He bravely snuggled into the man holding him, pressing his body closer and wrapping an arm around the kings waist. He rubbed his cheek against the strong chest&nbsp;and reveled in becoming a man&nbsp;by another man&#39;s&nbsp;hands. He had given pleasure to a great king and his heart swelled with love for the man who had brought him to such joyous heights.

Hephaestion leaned up to look at the still sleeping man. It was a wonderful opportunity to study the body that lay in repose. The king was beautiful. Such a strong yet loving face. Hephaestion longed to touch the features that were softened by sleep. Hair the color of the sun, made Hephaestion run his fingers over the ends. Leaning up on one elbow, Hephaestion stared at the strong chest. A body that had seen the battlefield. Hephaestion glanced quickly to see if the king still slept, before his eyes flew down to the massive organ that lay relaxed against his lover&#39;s thigh. The boy remembered Alexander&#39;s lips kissing him, licking and sucking him in such an intimate place. He remembered the rapturous feeling the action invoked. He wondered if the king would want Hephaestion to kiss him like that. To suck on the phallus that he knew could grow to such great lengths. He hoped so, he had so much to learn in this art of lovemaking. He saw a scar on Alexander&#39;s torso and another on his shoulder that ran down to his chest. Hephaestion couldn&#39;t help touching the scars, mapping them with his fingers. He imagined the pain the older man must have felt. He leaned down to lightly kiss the the scar that ran from shoulder to chest, touching the tip of his tongue to the puckered skin. He felt shy at his boldness and when he raised his head it was to find himself staring into the amused brown eyes of&nbsp;his king.

&quot;Don&#39;t stop,&quot; Alexander whispered huskily. &quot;I like you touching me.&quot;

Alexander moaned under the sensation of Hephaestion&#39;s&nbsp;tentative touch. The boy tenderly kissed each visible scar as if he could erase the pain that Alexander had felt. Never, had another man&#39;s touch left Alexander so breathless and aching with need.

It was a moment later that Alexander realized that Hephaestion had stopped his gentle caress.&nbsp; The boy was now sitting up, a flushed look upon his face. Nervous at taking intiative, he was trying to hide the erection he had developed. His cerulean eyes glancing at Alexander shyly. Alexander remembered being sixteen. Hard and ready all the time. He hadn&#39;t been able to get enough sex, once he had a taste of it. He hoped he would be able to keep up with the awakening&nbsp;fires of his young lover&#39;s body. He felt older then his twenty three years. Eying Hephaestion&#39;s organ, so smooth and silky over the hardness, the sight ignited Alexander&#39;s own fires. Yes, he decided, he could keep up. Making the decision to wait until the legal joining for further lovemaking, he&nbsp;willed down&nbsp;his lust for the&nbsp;intoxicating young man.

&#39;I am a little hungry,&quot; he said to the boy.

Eager to please, Hephaestion looked into the basket.

&quot;Do you want to try one of cooks candies? She makes them with honey and almonds.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll share one with you. And another glass of wine, if you would pour.&quot;

Hephaestion poured the wine, handing the glass to Alexander. He unwrapped a sweet from it&#39;s cloth wrapping and took a bite.

Alexander watched the full lips and strong white teeth sink into the candy, groaning when the tip of Hephaestion&#39;s tongue grabbed at a piece that was falling. Alexander took a sip of the wine, hiding his reaction to his lover&nbsp;who was fast becoming a must needed part of his life. Two days. Just two days and the boy was constantly in his thoughts. Like a craving in his bloodstream. Not just for sating his lust. He wanted to take care of the boy. Keep his innocence and joy of the world safe from harm. He wanted to ride and to take walks with him. Show him the sights of Pella, that he himself had loved as a boy. He wanted to see the world through Hephaestion&#39;s radiant eyes. These wishes scared him, he had always had his love and dreams dashed by his parents.&nbsp;Alexander was afraid of losing Hephaestion as the boy grew older and realized how desirable he was.

&quot;Alexander?&quot;

The king looked up and saw the guileless face of his beloved holding out the other half of the sweet. He reached out to grab Hephaestion&#39;s wrist, his lips taking the treat from his lovers hold. His tongue licking and sucking the sticky substance from the trembling fingers. Alexander watched his lover&#39;s eyes darken and his cheeks turn crimson with passion.

Hephaestion was mortified to hear an agonized moan pass from his lips, causing the king to smile triumphantly.

&quot;Wine,&quot; the boy whispered. &quot;Can I have some wine?&quot;

Alexander reached for the glass, taking a long sip before holding the glass to Hephaestion&#39;s&nbsp;mouth for him to drink. He then leaned forward to kiss the moist lips.

&quot;Are you happy with our arrangement?&quot; Alexander asked the glowing boy.

&quot;I was scared a few days ago. I can not believe how glad I am now,&quot; Hephaestion answered happily. &quot;Are you.........happy, Alexander?&quot;

&quot;I am very pleased by the way things turned out,&quot; the king replied.

&quot;Can we.....you know......do it again?&quot; Hephaestion asked boldly. His face betraying his youthful desire.

&quot;I want nothing more, my love. I think we should wait for our joining ceremony though.&quot;

&quot;When will that be?&quot;

&quot;I need to be back in Pella. I will send a steward to work with your father. So I was thinking the day after tomorrow. We can journey north the next day.&quot;

&quot;We have to leave so soon?&quot; Hephaestion was dismayed that he would be leaving his family so quickly.

Seeing the sadness in his lovers eyes, Alexander wanted nothing more then to take it away.

&quot;Perhaps they can join us in Pella, before we journey to Persia.&quot;

&quot;Really, Alexander?&quot;

&quot;Really.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; the boy cried, throwing himself into the kings arms.

Alexander gulped at the sudden feeling of having his arms filled with a naked quivering Hephaestion. He held the boy close for a moment before looking down into wide luminous eyes. Alexander&#39;s control could only go so far. He lowered his face to kiss the lips that were offered to him, eliciting a moan from both he and the warm boy laying in his arms.

&quot;Hephaestion. Alexander.&quot;

The two realized they were being summoned from a nearby voice.

&quot;Yes, Triton,&quot; Hephaestion answered.

Triton appeared at the top of the stairs, averting his eyes from the lovers.

&quot;Lord Amnitor would like to talk to you, Sire. And the lady would like you to dine with the family. You and your generals. I told her you were looking at kittens, she knows of Hephaestion&#39;s fondness of cats.&quot;

&quot;Triton,&quot; Hephaestion cried!

Alexander smiled when he saw Hephaestion&#39;s indignant blush. Triton, used to the boy&#39;s small tantrums just talked on.

&quot;I figured I would give you time to bathe the......day from your bodies. Dinner is in&nbsp;under&nbsp;two hours.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Triton,&quot; Alexander answered when Hephaestion stayed mute. &quot;We will be down directly.&quot;

Alexander saw the tall man who reminded him of Cleitus glance once at Hephaestion, raking his eyes over the delectable form, before going back down the stairs. Seeing the boy blush from&nbsp;having been seen naked&nbsp;in&nbsp;a compromising position, he asked his lover sharply.

&quot;Who is he to your family?&quot;

&quot;He was hired as my personal bodyguard last year, when father started to worry more about me,&quot; Hephaestion answered innocently. &quot;He goes everywhere with me. I hope he won&#39;t be mad at having to move to Pella and later to where ever your army goes. Maybe he can teach me to fight, Alexander.&quot;

Alexander remained quiet as he thought of the look the man gave his lover, and thought that Triton would have no worry about moving to Pella as Hephaestion&#39;s bodyguard. He would be relieved of that duty. After all, who better to watch over the boy then Alexander and his own personal guard?

The two shared kisses while dressing, Hephaestion giggling when Alexander would insist upon touching his bare skin before it was covered. The king picked hay from the boys hair, loving the debauched and naive look that was his betrothed.

&quot;Alexander?&quot;

&quot;What is it, my love?&quot;

&quot;I.....I.....&quot;

&quot;I told you to not be afraid to ask or tell me anything.&quot;

&quot;Since we won&#39;t be joined for two whole days, you won&#39;t.......you know, do this with anybody else, will you?&quot; Hephaestion looked at the king with wide hopeful eyes.

&quot;No, baby. I have no need for anybody else. I promise.&quot;

Hephaestion smiled and blushed. Happily he glanced at his lover.

&quot;I.....I like when you call me baby.&quot;

Alexander smiled and picked up his baby, giving him a twirl in the air. He enjoyed the rapturous cry and laughter he wrought from his beloved. Giving the boy a quick kiss, he set him back on his feet.

&quot;Come on, before your mother comes looking for us.&quot;


The group was enjoying an after dinner drink with their host. Hephaestion who was never allowed with the adults when his father had friends to dinner tried to be on his best behavior.

&quot;We have had many reports these last several days of slavers. The Roman ship sailed home this morning. Makes me suspicious of why they came. They were not interested in any deal. And I am not sure of Bessos return to Persia. It is the black sails of Persia that have been reported. I am&nbsp;sorry that I made the offer to the two nations. I should have just surrendered to you and asked for your help.&quot;

Seeing Hephaestion&#39;s embarrassment for his father&#39;s situation, Alexander patted his future father in laws arm.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Celeas. Your ploy got me here fast, and I am most pleased with my purchase.&quot;

All the men laughed when Hephaestion slapped the king on the arm at being called a purchase. But the diversion of the subject took away both the Amnitor&#39;s pain.

&quot;What of the boys and girls these slavers take,&quot; asked Cleitus?

&quot;We don&#39;t know. Sold in Persia. Or Egypt. Or given to Darius for his harem. We never hear anything of them again.&quot;

Alexander moved to the far corner of his couch. Hephaestion had fallen asleep with his head upon his shoulder. Alexander moved his head to lay in his lap, while Amnitor put&nbsp;the boys&nbsp;feet up on the couch. Both men looked at the boy with love in their eyes. Hephaestion had a long day. With little sleep the night before and an early visit to monuments of the gods, the afternoon lovemaking had exhausted the boy.

&quot;You must worry for your children constantly,&quot; Ptolemy remarked. &quot;They are all so beautiful. We never had to worry about slavers.&quot;

&quot;What can we do?&quot; asked Cassander of his king.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what we can do. We can take Persia and give the slavers no market for their flesh. Find out who they are and kill them. You and your people will have to be vigilant for a couple more years.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; said Cleitus, &quot;when we even start to take Persia, Darius will call upon all his men. It may not be to long before the sons and daughters of Athens are safe.&quot;

&quot;On a lighter subject, is the ceremony planned for our lovebirds,&quot; teased Cassander?

&quot;We have two days. Hephaestion is not a bride that has to have the full regalia,&quot; remarked Amnitor. &quot;I haven&#39;t the means for a big ceremony.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion will just want to be with the king.&quot; Cleitus had been watching the two all night. Even now with Hephaestion&#39;s head snuggled into the kings lap, Alexander had been attentive. Brushing back the boys hair with his fingers, rubbing his shoulders.

&quot;It&#39;s best to keep it small. Just family,&quot; Alexander said quietly. &quot;I want to leave early the next day.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for inviting us to Macedon, Sire. I thought my lady wife would cry. She will&nbsp;rest&nbsp;assured that Hephaestion is happy. I hope your mother will welcome him into her home.&quot;

The four Macedonians looked at each other. Olympias was a sober thought on any day.

&quot;She will love him,&quot; Alexander said to ease the&nbsp;fathers mind. &quot;We should get to bed. I will see you in our rooms, my friends. Lord Amnitor, if you would show me the way to Hephaestion&#39;s rooms. I will carry him up.&quot;

&quot;By the gods, no. He is to heavy for that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, let him,&quot; Cleitus said. &quot;He&#39;s a strong king. And he wants to put the boy to bed.&quot;

Alexander just smiled. It was true.


Alexander woke several hours later. Terror had woken him but he knew not why. Living with danger these last few years had taught him not to ignore his feelings. Going out into the outer room, he saw that both Cleitus and Cassander were up.

&quot;We felt it too,&quot; Cleitus remarked. &quot;No noise. Just a feeling.&quot;

Ptolemy came in quietly from the outside.

&quot;Three men heading towards the palace. They look like boys, Sire.&quot;

&quot;Where are Amnitors guard? He has his army spread too thin.&quot; Cassander didn&#39;t like mistakes.

&quot;Should I call our men, Sire?&quot;

&quot;No, we can remain unobserved without them. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening. Better armor up though.&quot;


The four men followed the whispers in the night. They led&nbsp;outside of the bedrooms of the royal family. Hephaestion, whose bedroom was furthest away was where the whispers were coming from. They stood outside the balcony calling up to Hephaestion.

&quot;Hephaestion, hurry.&quot;

&quot;Be careful.&quot;

&quot;Shh.&quot;

The Macedonians watched astonished as they realized that the invaders weren&#39;t invaders at all. But three young boys. Obviously friends of Hephaestion as they watched awe struck as the young lord shimmied from his bedroom&nbsp;balcony down several sheets that he had tied together. Alexander seethed with anger as they followed the four boys down the path to the sea.

&quot;He&#39;s sneaking out to go swimming,&quot; Cassander remarked. &quot;That one is going to keep you busy, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t he hear of the talk of the slavers?&quot; Ptolemy couldn&#39;t believe the boys audacity.

&quot;They&#39;re young. They think nothing can happen to them. Remember how we would sneak to the caves?&quot; Cassander reminded them.

&quot;And remember how I had to save you that one time,&quot; Cleitus laughed.

The trio realized that the king was quiet and the reason why was now swimming and playing in the water. At least the boys had kept on their night shirts, only taking off their robes.

Alexander was seething. Angry that Hephaestion was risking his safety. Maybe his life. He didn&#39;t even have time to be mad that one of the other boys seemed to keep touching his lover. He was so afraid that something might have happened to his betrothed if he hadn&#39;t followed them. No sooner were these thoughts in his head when they heard shouting and then muffled voices.

&quot;They are under attack,&quot; he cried, running into the fray with his companions right behind him.

They could see a rowboat moored a short distance away. The moonlight afforded them enough light to be able to see. One of the boys was able to run away, Cleitus knocking down the man that tried to follow the young man.&nbsp;He hit&nbsp;the slaver&nbsp;with the blunt of his sword, not wanting to kill the man.

Both Cassander and Ptolemy were fighting two other men who had tried taking the two other boys. Surprise was on the side of Macedon. They quickly took the Persians. They knew they were Persians as the&nbsp;slavers were no longer trying to be quiet.

Alexander was looking everywhere at once. He was terrified. He didn&#39;t see Hephaestion. He scanned the darkness, his heart in his throat.

&quot;Hephaestion,&quot; he yelled! &quot;Hephaestion!&quot;

&quot;Alexander, there,&quot; Cleitus yelled pointing to a second rowboat moored further away. The moon came out from behind a cloud. In a split second, Alexander could see a ship harbored out to sea. Saw a man climbing into the rowboat, pulling a struggling Hephaestion in after him. He had his arms pinned back, and a hand over&nbsp;the boy&#39;s&nbsp;mouth. The Persian threw Hephaestion to the floor of the boat, and started rowing towards his ship, leaving the others to their fate.


Alexander could hear and see his own soldiers running down the path, but it would be too late if he waited. He ran through the water, starting to swim as it got deeper. He wasn&#39;t going to make it! Fortunately Hephaestion tried to jump overboard, the Persian stopped him, pulling him back into the boat. Hephaestion turned around and started fighting. He was no match for the Persian, but it afforded Alexander time to get there. Pulling himself over the side of the boat, he battled the Persian until the boat started tipping. Struggling to stay in the boat, the slaver let down his guard. Alexander, with a bold move, balancing on one leg was able to&nbsp;run his sword through the man&#39;s stomach. He heard the shouts to pull up and move out from the slaver ship. Alexander, looking up, saw the face of the man who stood by the railing of the ship. Bessos! He vowed to himself that if had to chase that man to the far reaches of the empire, he would.

He turned to Hephaestion, who sat huddled on a seat staring up fearfully at his king. Alexander carelessly pushed the body of the slaver overboard and started rowing towards shore. He let his generals pull him in. Not waiting for Amnitor to speak to his son, he pulled the boy from the boat and away from the others. He gave Triton a dirty look as he passed. Hephaestion stumbled a little, but Alexander just pulled him along.

Finally stopping a good distance away, Alexander turned to his lover and gripped both arms tightly. He restrained himself from shaking the&nbsp;frightened boy.

&quot;Any man in my army or in my kingdom would have been dismissed, beaten or tortured for disobeying a direct command from their king. You knew you were not allowed to swim. As my husband, if you <em>ever</em> do anything that I have expressly forbidden <em>ever</em> again you will find yourself over my knees and spanked so hard you won&#39;t sit for days. Do you understand?&quot; Alexander gripped Hephaestion&#39;s chin to be able to look into his tearful eyes.

&quot;Do you understand, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Any orders given are for a reason, Hephaestion. I was so scared when I saw the Persian had you in his boat. I feared I may die from the pain of losing you. I don&#39;t know what I would have done, my love.&quot;

Hephaestion burst into tears, throwing himself into Alexander&#39;s arms and sobbed uncontrollably.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Alexander. You.....you can.....punish me, if you want.&quot;

Alexander met Amnitor&#39;s eyes over Hephaestion&#39;s head. Their boy had learned his lesson. They were sure he would need to learn many others, but for now he was very contrite.

Alexander watched his soldiers, who had followed them down the path, gather the prisoners. His companions were leading the other wayward boys up the path to their own families. Amnitor was no doubt releasing a red faced Triton from his duty as personal guard to his son.

Alexander held his boy a little tighter. So glad to be able to have him in his arms. Grateful that he and his generals trusted their instincts.

&quot;Shh, baby. It&#39;s alright. I forgive you. Come on, let&#39;s get you back to bed. Do you think you can stay&nbsp;there this time?&quot;

Hephaestion giggled, which caused him to hiccup.

&#39;I love you, Alexander,&quot; the boy whispered, still scared of his lover&#39;s disappointment.

Alexander hugged his&nbsp;beloved close, leaning down to kiss the trembling lips.

&quot;I love you too, baby.&quot;</font></div>"

<lj-cut><font size=""2""><font size=""3""> &nbsp;&nbsp; This an Alternate Universe story


Hephaestion arched into the moist heat, the sensation going to his groin. His body was instantly aflame.

&quot;Wait,&quot; he cried, as he felt Alexander divest him of the rest of his clothes.

Hephaestion felt Alexander stop, but his lips did not move from their downward travel. They still touched the skin of his lower stomach, his lips nuzzling faintly the few hairs that&nbsp;grew from his navel to his swelling manhood.

Alexander looked up at the panicking boy.

&quot;Have I given you reason to fear me?&quot; Alexander asked. &quot;Yesterday, while we were by the sea? In the barn? I only want to give you pleasure, little one. Lay back, I wish to taste you. No harm will come to you.&quot; 

Alexander reached up and gently pushed Hephaestion back, trailing his hand down the silken skin. He prayed to his gods that he could control his own body. This was a test for is own endurance. His nostrils flared from Hephaestion&#39;s scent. A scent like no other, it intoxicated him.&nbsp;Hephaestion was a &nbsp;feast for all his senses.

Hephaestion looked into the eyes of his lover as he allowed himself to be pushed back.&nbsp;Alexander&#39;s voice had a richness that thrilled him and his eyes were hypnotic. He felt&nbsp;the king&#39;s&nbsp;lips continue their descent, while his hand still swept across his torso. The glide over his stomach felt like heat had blazed over him, and he cried out when the fingers pinched at his nipple, the same time that Alexander&#39;s tongue licked the length of his turgid shaft. Both hands were busy now. Alexander held his member to his mouth, once in a while gently squeezing and rolling his balls. Hephaestion was moaning now and making small noises in his throat. He didn&#39;t think he could take it. He felt like he was being branded. It was too much, and not enough at the same time. His body sought fulfillment, but he didn&#39;t know of what kind. He thrashed his head and his body writhed. He felt the king hold him down, the heat from his hand another brand on his sensitive skin. And when he felt a wet finger penetrate his bottom and tap at a certain spot inside him, he thought he might die from the pleasure. He cried out from joy and frustration, his body&nbsp;instinctively seeking something that his mind had little clue. And from a far off place he heard Alexander groan, give one last twirl of his tongue around Hephaestion&#39;s phallus&nbsp;and his actions ceased. Hephaestion&#39;s eyes flew open at the loss and emptiness his body felt.

Alexander wanted Hephaestion to spend in his mouth, and another time he would enjoy many hours of tasting the boy and teaching him to taste Alexander&#39;s own body. The thought made his already throbbing cock more rigid, and for a moment he pressed it against Hephaestion&#39;s legs. This first time though, the first time they lay together, he needed to feel Hephaestion&#39;s orgasm&nbsp;while he was deep inside the desirable body.

&quot;Feel what you do to me. I have never wanted another as much as I want you. I wish to consummate our relationship.&quot; 

Alexander stood and slowly took off his clothes, the whole time his eyes never leaving Hephaestion&#39;s. He watched as the young boy took in what he was doing. His eyes widening as Alexander disrobed. The innocence warring with his sensuality. Hephaestion turned him on like no other.

Looking up at Alexander, Hephaestion&#39;s eyes told of his desire. He had never seen Alexander&#39;s chest. Sleek muscles were now visible, as well as a smattering of scars. Hephaestion was shocked at his thoughts when he had a longing to run his own tongue over each testament of Alexander&#39;s earlier warrior days.. His shoulders seemed so wide. Deceiving when clothed in his kings tunics. Powerful arms, that made him long to be wrapped in them. When Hephaestion had thought of his power it was in relation to his being king, not his physical body. He was lean and his height might not have been as daunting as Cleitus&#39;s, but his impact on Hephaestion was awe inspiring as he stared in admiration. He had not imagined the hard strength beneath&nbsp;the clothes. And as he gazed in fascination, he realized that he saw Alexander as a man not just a king. A big man, he thought as his eyes flew to the impressive size of his lover. Fear assailed him again at the thought of it being inside him. Fortunately, Alexander had been watching for such a reaction.

The king dropped to his knee&#39;s between the boy&#39;s spread legs. The wanton pose from such an innocent boy had Alexander again thanking his luck. He didn&#39;t give the boy time to think, he just lowered himself to kiss the open lips, tasting the sweetness from the wine and Hephaestion&#39;s own&nbsp;luscious mouth. He shifted&nbsp;the boy&#39;s&nbsp;knee&#39;s so that they were bent, his mouth never leaving&nbsp;his&nbsp;betroths. He reached into the basket to find the churned butter that had been included for the bread, coating his fingers with the oily substance. He lowered his head to suck on Hephaestion&#39;s neck, at the same time his fingers entered his young lovers body. He thought that it would be&nbsp;easier from behind for Hephaestion&#39;s first time, but the intimacy of being face to face was something they both needed. Besides to watch Hephaestion&#39;s face as he reached orgasm, was a wondrous sight.

Alexander leaned up to almost kneel, placing Hephaestion&#39;s shapely legs around his own waist.

&quot;Shh, it&#39;s alright.&quot; He coated his throbbing cock liberally with the rich butter. Hephaestion watched his movements, trembling from his desire, his body had a light sheen of sweat that made his tanned skin glow.

Alexander placed his cock at the virgin entrance and pushed. Hephaestion cried out as the thick head penetrated, and his eyes darkened to a deep blue almost violet color. Alexander was in rapt delight of the smooth tightness that held him and the beautiful face below him. Even Hephaestion&#39;s pain belonged to him. He slowly pushed in the rest of the way not stopping for adjustment, just a slow prolonged push inside, until his thick length was sheathed in the velvet tightness. He rested a minute, as much for him as for Hephaestion.He was sweaty from exertion, but the breeze blowing in through the loft door felt good upon naked skin.

Alexander smiled at his lover, leaning forward to steal a kiss, while gently placing the boys shapely legs atop his strong shoulders.

&quot;You feel so good,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Are you ready?&#39;

Not trusting himself to speak, Hephaestion just nodded. He was laying there naked with his legs draping down the kings back and the mans shaft lodged firmly in his bottom. He was embarrassed, and he didn&#39;t know what to do.

&quot;Whats wrong?&quot; Alexander asked, as he saw the troubled look pass over the exquisite features.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do,&quot; the boy said quietly.

Alexander smiled, so pleased with his betrothed.

&quot;You can learn how to please me later, &nbsp;just enjoy for now.&quot;

Alexander pulled all the way out until just the throbbing tip remained inside, and began a steady thrusting, his hips angling to hit Hephaestion&#39;s pleasure gland. He watched the boy&#39;s eyes grow large when he felt his own body&#39;s intense joy. Hephaestion was writhing now, his hips were pressing&nbsp;gently back to meet Alexander&#39;s thrusts, Alexander&#39;s balls were slapping Hephaestion&#39;s ass, and he reveled in the feeling. His cock was in a soft vice, and he couldn&#39;t hold out much longer. He reached between them to fist Hephaestion&#39;s slick shaft. His own painful erection now pounding gently into the boy, finding the spot inside him again and again until Hephaestion erupted in an unrestrained orgasm, crying out his delight&nbsp;to his lovers ears. The waves of orgasm and the grip of Hephaestion&#39;s body made Alexander give one more mighty push into&nbsp;his receptive lover, burying himself deep as he exploded inside his betrothed, crying out his own surprised joy.

Alexander lowered Hephaestion&#39;s legs, kissing the now closed eyelids and the full lips. He reached over to wipe Hephaestion&#39;s essence from both of their bodies with the edge of the blanket, and then lowered his full weight upon the reposed boy. He reached up to put both hands on Hephaestion&#39;s cheeks, causing his lover to open his passion filled eyes.

&quot;You belong to me now. You&#39;re mine. Say it.&quot;

&quot;Yours,&quot; the tired boy answered, lowering his lids once again.

Alexander sighed with relief, rolling over to his side. He gathered his fiance into his arms, holding him close. The breeze from the great sea cooling both their bodies. His heart beat fast, not from exertion, but with the realization that he was madly in love with the charming boy in his arms.</font></font></lj-cut>"

The last thing he wanted to do was wake his parents, even though his room was at the end of the long corridor. He walked slowly over to his bed to sit down, but remained standing. In the last hour his world had changed. He had waited for his father to retire. After hearing him tell his mother earlier that day&nbsp;that he would&nbsp;be up after midnight. Hephaestion knew that he wouldn't have a long wait. He needed to speak to Alexander. The things that he had seen, had woken something inside him. For as long as he could remember, his mother had taken he and his sisters to her fathers whenever the months of court were being held.&nbsp; Telling them, that it was long and boring business that they wouldn't need to be around father for that.. Grandfather lived on one of the islands. An island hidden by other islands, that made sailing to it difficult. However once they were there, they could swim and play in relative safety. Now, after all these years; Hephaestion understood why. Why they were taken away. And why they were threatened with punishment if they ventured down to the courts main hall late at night. Mother had to have known what went on, and after keeping it from him all these years, Hephaestion knew the secrets of the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Hephaestion slumped to the cool floor and leaned his head back against the bed. He had woken up from his dreamlike life and seen the world around him. Had others laughed at his innocence?&nbsp; It's not as if he were stupid. He had seen animals. He knew that men and women must do something like that in order to have children. For some reason, he never wanted to think about what men and women did together. When his father told him he was to be joined with another man, and he hoped for the king of Macedonia, it all seemed right to him. So of course he wondered. He was scared though, scared a fat, older man like some of his fathers friends would want him. And when he thought of men like that, his dreaming stopped. It had sickened him to think about kissing somebody like that. And then he learned about the young king, and he dared to let himself dream a little bit. He imagined kissing and maybe touching each other. Never did he dream about the things he saw tonight. He saw boys on their knee's with the phallus of other men in their mouths. Would the king want Hephaestion to do that to him? Would Alexander do it in return? The men were touching each other in places where Hephaestion had never even touched himself. And he saw penetration. Boys and girls with their skirts around their waist were on their hands and knee's or bouncing on men's laps. Everywhere in the room acts of passion were going on, except the royal couches; and Hephaestion hadn't been able to take it all in. So he had a vague notion of seeing Alexander. For once he dared to sneak back to the hall, surprised when nobody stopped him. He had stopped when he saw the two rutting, thinking that the man had hair like Alexander's. Clothes like Alexander's. And it dawned on Hephaestion what he was seeing. <em>His </em>betrothed rutting with the boy who brought him tea in the morning. <em>His</em> intended pushing his male organ into the boy's bottom. Hephaestion watched when he wanted to pull his lover away from the boy. Watched when he wanted to jump them and lash out in fury. Watched when the betraying thought came to him, that he wished it were him that Alexander was mating with. And with that thought he knew rage. Knew jealousy. It <em>should</em> be him. After the wonderful afternoon they had, how could.........? It hadn't been enough for Alexander.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hephaestion got up onto the bed to lay down. He felt anguished tears fall from his eyes and couldn't be bothered to wipe them away. He wanted to run far from home, yet he knew that wouldn't help his city. He also knew that he still wanted to join with Alexander. He would have to think about the way he would act. He knew that Alexander loved him. He could see it in his eyes. Knew that he was desired by the king. Maybe it was as his mother said, just a lack of proper upbringing. Hephaestion would somehow have to tell the king that he didn't want him to do that with other boys. Would Alexander be mad? Would he ignore the wishes of his young consort? He was a soldier, a warrior, why would he listen to Hephaestion? He started to sniffle, and his teary eyes were growing heavy. His heart felt so full of sadness that he didn't think he could take it. He wondered how Alexander would feel if the situation was reversed.<br /><br /><br />Alexander walked quietly beside Cleitus. Hephaestion had said that he hated him, the words causing pain in Alexander's chest. It hadn't even been that good, he thought defiantly. The boy had been wet from another's seed, and smelled from days old sweat. He felt like cursing the Gods for allowing Hephaestion to enter the outer hall at that moment. The boy wouldn't understand how meaningless it was. He still saw through a veil. Well maybe not anymore. If only he and Amnitor had remembered to send him from the hall earlier. Alexander didn't think he would ever forget those beautiful eyes so full of pain, the lips quivering from trying not to cry. He hated himself for causing pain to reach his sweet betrothed.<br /><br />""Alexander, I think you love him,"" Cleitus mused beside him.<br /><br />""I don't love him!""<br /><br />""I think you do. I don't blame you if you did. I have never seen a more charming boy. It is as if Zeus has dropped him in our world with no preparation for its harshness. Tread carefully, Alexander. I feel he is a great gift to our kingdom.""<br /><br />""You didn't even want me to join with him, Cleitus.""<br /><br />""I have changed my mind. He will be good for you.""<br /><br />""I don't even know what to say to him.""<br /><br />""Macedon's great diplomat, the man who talked a nation into invading Persia. You don't even know what to say to one small boy? The answer is in front of your face, Alexander.""<br /><br />""By the gods, Cleitus. Stop with the theatrics. Just tell me.""<br /><br />""Tell him you're sorry, Alexander.""<br /><br /><br />Hephaestion awoke to somebody setting tea on his bedside table.<br /><br />""Good morning, my lord. I hope you slept well.""<br /><br />Hephaestion opened his eyes. How could the gods do this to him? The same boy who had allowed Alexander to penetrate his body. No embarrassment or shame. A smug look was on his face that Hephaestion wanted to wipe off. He had never raised his hand at another, and now he wanted to hit this boy and Alexander too.<br /><br />The boy was just standing beside the bed, smirking down at a tear stained Hephaestion. He loved getting one over on the masters young son. So innocent of the world.<br /><br />""Was there something you wanted?""<br /><br />""I wanted to apologize for last night,"" the boy said insincerely.<br /><br />""Get out,"" Hephaestion said to the smug servant. He wasn't equipped to handle such unkindness. ""Send Triton in to see me.""<br /><br /><br />""My lord, King Alexander is here to see you.""<br /><br />""Well, don't leave him waiting. Send him in."" Turning to his wife, he asked the good woman to leave them alone, that they needed to conclude business.&nbsp;Trusting her husband, she bid him &nbsp;a good morning and the same to the king as they passed each other.<br /><br />""Lord Amnitor, I wish to speak to Hephaestion.""<br /><br />""He won't be back till this afternoon, King Alexander. He went with Triton to Athens. He said he needed to visit the monuments. He is very interested in the Gods and our history with them. He feels the need to go there when he&nbsp;wants to think about something.""<br /><br />""I would have liked to go with him.""<br /><br />""I don't think you would have liked it this morning.""<br /><br />Amnitor seeing the surprised look in the kings eyes couldn't help but say a bit snidely. ""Yours is not the only palace that has ears for it's lord.""<br /><br />""I didn't mean to hurt him. It is the last thing I could ever want.""<br /><br />""I know that, son. It wasn't your fault. I should have done a lot of things different with the boy.""<br /><br />Alexander sat down and poured himself tea.<br /><br />""I'm glad you didn't. I quite like him the way he is. He is refreshing and adorable.""<br /><br />""You are now my king and there is much I can't say to you. However, since you are now much like a son in law, I feel I can tell you that I want this fixed. I don't want my son to lose his sweetness. He will in time as he follows you to war. But for now. I wish for his happiness.""<br /><br />""I can be quite persuasive,&nbsp; I will mend his heart, and keep it safe. I too wish for his happiness, Celeas.""<br /><br />""Then I have misjudged you. I feared you were uncaring of a boys feelings, much like your father would have been.""<br /><br />""My father never met Hephaestion, even he would be charmed by the boy.""<br /><br />""if you say so. The few times I met the man, he didn't have much love in his heart.""<br /><br />""No, you are right. He wasn't a man with generous feelings.""<br /><br />""You grew up to be a good man, in spite of his failings.""<br /><br />Alexander felt proud to have this man's praise. And to have his son.<br /><br />""Will Hephaestion be back soon?""<br /><br />Amnitor chuckled. ""I'll send for you, Alexander. Perhaps you would like to visit our library.""<br /><br /><br />Amnitor found Alexander in the war room with Cleitus and Caassander. The other one, Ptolemy had told him where to find the king.<br /><br />""You have an excellent collection of shields and swords, my lord,"" said the tall one, Cleitus.<br /><br />""It is a passion of mine. So many of our ancestry of armory is lost. I find things when I can and try&nbsp;to preserve them.""<br /><br />""A noble interest,"" spoke the king, with a question in his eyes.<br /><br />""Excuse me, may I speak to you Alexander?""<br /><br />""Go ahead, Alexander,"" teased Cassander. ""He has been watching for your son all day.""<br /><br /><br />In the hallway, Amnitor handed him a blanket and a small basket, that had been sitting on a chair.<br /><br />""Hephaestion is in the farthest barn. It is used for hay and straw. He snuck in through the foot paths. I doubt that it is from not wanting to see you, as it is that he is embarrassed&nbsp;of his own reactions. He hides in the loft, by the open top door facing the sea. The light is good to read his scrolls.""<br /><br />Alexander sighed with relief. Finally. except now that the moment was at hand, he was nervous about what he was going to say to the boy.<br /><br />""Speak from the heart,Alexander,"" said the kindly man.<br /><br /><br />Alexander reached the farthest barn and quietly went inside. He saw the man who was Hephaestion's personal guard and got the head nod from the fellow&nbsp;conspirator.<br /><br />The king climbed the steep steps leading to the loft, surprised and happy that there wasn't a ladder. The basket Amnitor had given him was unwieldy.<br /><br />Alexander saw Hephaestion by the open loft door. He had a book of scrolls on his lap, but he was just staring out at the sea. For the moment that he went undetected, Alexander saw the open look of despair on the beautiful young face.<br /><br />""Hephaestion,"" he whispered.<br /><br />Hephaestion's head whipped around, his face betraying joy, before the mask shuttered down.<br /><br />""What are you doing here? I am trying not to see you.""<br /><br />Alexander smiled. ""I know. I had your father's help."" Alexander looked around. Loose clover hay was in abudance. Fluffy and sweet smelling. He made his way over to Hephaestion to spread his blanket on the loose hay by the door. The breeze from the sea made this one of the coolest spots on the palace grounds. That Hephaestion hadn't asked him to leave, he took as great fortune.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander took Hephaestion's hand and pulled him to sit with him on the blanket. Relieved and perturbed that he complied so easily.<br /><br />""Hephaestion, I wish we didn't need to speak of last night, however I feel we must.""<br /><br />""Why wouldn't <em>you</em> want to speak of it? You weren't the one who saw your betrothed with another boy.""<br /><br />""Thank Zeus for that,"" Alexander muttered. ""I have never had to think about my actions before, Hephaestion. After being with you all day, I felt such strain, and after you left, I needed the release.""<br /><br />""I would have helped you with your release, like you did for me,"" the boy said shyly. ""i never knew that...........""<br /><br />""That what, Hephaestion?""<br /><br />""That men could do those things,"" Hephaestion sighed. ""I feel stupid and immature every time I say something for fear you are laughing at my lack of knowledge.""<br /><br />Alexander leaned forward to hold the boys hand, rubbing his thumb on the palm. He could feel the slight tremor from&nbsp;his delectable lover.<br /><br />""The things you say may be innocent, but&nbsp;they're you. And you speak from the heart. It's why I am falling in love with <em>you</em>, and nobody else that I have <em>ever</em> been with. I love your innocence, Hephaestion.""<br /><br />""Really, Alexander?""<br /><br />""I never want you afraid&nbsp; or shy to speak what's on your mind or what's in your heart.""<br /><br />'Alright, then why wasn't it me you wanted last night? That boy, he......he came to my room, to wake me, this morn. I never want that feeling again, Alexander.""<br /><br />""Did he say anything?""<br /><br />""It does not matter.""<br /><br />Which told Alexander that it did matter. However the boy did not.<br /><br />""Hephaestion, I would rather it was you. It is your flesh I dream of. I can taste you, after you are gone. I still feel your bottom in my hands after I have cupped your cheeks. Feel your tongue in my mouth, hear the moans and cries you make. And I long for more. I want to ravish you, explore you, make you cry with need for me. Because that's how&nbsp;I feel about you. You're so innocent that I loath scaring you. That boy, he was nothing. I am so sorry I hurt you, Hephaestion.""<br /><br />Alexander nearly melted from the hopeful look on the young face.<br /><br />""My family is not like your's Hephaestion. Father was often mean. I will tell you someday. My mother, she says she loves me, but her love is cold and is only there when she would have me do her bidding."" </font><p><font size=""3"">""You don't think I am like that, do you Alexander?""</font></p><p><font size=""3"">""No, my little treasure. I know you are not. We are both a product of our upbringing. I do hurtful things with out thinking and you are such sweet innocence."" Alexander smiled at the blush that crept up the exquisite face.<br /><br />""Will you forgive me, Hephaestion?""<br /><br />Hephaestion gave a small nod. There had never really been any doubt.</font></p><p><font size=""3"">Alexander gave him a tender kiss, marveling at the shiver he felt from such a small caress of his lips. He opened the basket that Amnitor had given him. Cheese, a crusty loaf, and a sweet treat, that he saw Hephaestions eyes gleam for. A small flask of wine, and one goblet for them both to sip from. Food for seduction, and a fathers permission. Pouring them a full glass of wine, noting that it was slightly watered, he remarked at the repast.<br /><br />""Your father must think we are hungry.""<br /><br />""He sent this? I left before breaking my fast this morn. He knew this.""<br /><br />""Ah, you were trying to avoid me,"" Alexander teased, slipping a piece of bread and cheese in Hephaestion's mouth. When Hephaestion was done chewing he held the wine to the full lips, watching his lover take a sip. When he was done, Alexander turned the goblet to drink from the same place.<br /><br />Hephaestion's eyes grew round, and he licked his lips. Alexander watched the pink tongue trace the lips that he wanted to taste. Taking another sip of wine, he leaned in to share with Hephaestion. The boy leaned into the kiss, moaning from pleasure.<br /><br />Alexander wrapped his arms around his lover, pulling him in to lay against his body. He ravished the sweet mouth. Relishing the feel of Hephaestion's innocent body arching into his. The boy was a smoldering fire waiting to ignite. Alexander couldn't wait to be burned from the heat.<br /><br />""Will you let me take you?""<br /><br />""Take me where?"" Was the breathy reply from the boy who was looking up at him in such raw innocent passion.<br /><br />""Hephaestion, you slay me. You are every mans dream. I want to have you. Make love to you.""<br /><br />""Like last night?""<br /><br />""Yes....and no. It is more then that. Last night wasn't about love. Can I show you?""<br /><br />Hephaestion's answer was to kiss the king again.<br /><br />Alexander wasted no time.&nbsp; He slowly pulled hephaestion's chiton over his head, seeing the boys chest for the first time. He had a smooth&nbsp;body that pleased the king.&nbsp;Pushing Hephaestion gently back, he kissed the boys neck, licking and kissing a path to his nipples.&nbsp;He roughly&nbsp;lathed the full flat part of his tongue against the hard pebble.............. <br /><br /></font></p></div></div>"

part two </font><lj-cut></lj-cut>

<lj-cut><font size=""3""> &nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an Alternate Universe story&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Hephaestion was torn from wanting to stay in the hall, as his father had allowed him to do and just returning to his family&#39;s private wing. He guessed that he ruined any chance of an adult conversation with the king. Pain&nbsp;lanced Hephaestion&#39;s heart as he thought of the king kissing somebody else because Hephaestion had said that he wouldn&#39;t marry the man.&nbsp;Ironically, all day he had been daydreaming&nbsp;that the soldier who had kissed him, and held him in his strong arms, was really the king, and that he had fallen in love with Hephaestion. If that were the case, then maybe he had been unreasonable to be so angry. He couldn&#39;t help it, he was upset that his soldier would just kiss any cute boy he ran across.

As Hephaestion entered the familial quarters, he heard murmurings in his sisters rooms. The four of them shared several large rooms. Being so young they didn&#39;t want to be alone. Hephaestion guessed that&nbsp;it would soon change as they grew older, and sighed with sadness that he wouldn&#39;t be there to watch his sisters grow up. He was scared that his father would sell him to Persia or Rome. If that were the case, he would <em>never</em> see home again. Although Hephaestion supposed that his father, being a loyal Greek would never actually allow either of those two nations a foothold into his lands. He had just wanted to drive the price up for the Macedon king. And now Hephaestion had ruined his fathers chances for a peaceful union. What if war was declared all because of his childish jealousies? Hadn&#39;t he told himself just the other day that he didn&#39;t care what his mate did, as long as he was left alone? He didn&#39;t know why he was so confused. All he did know was that he didn&#39;t want the handsome king to kiss anybody else.

Hephaestion watched from his sisters doorway as his mother kissed Hanna and Phonia, his two youngest sisters, and covered their sleeping bodies. As four year old twins, their active day tired them and everybody around them.

&quot;Phai, come join us,&quot; cried six year old Dani, holding the kitten their father had obviously let her have. Hephaestion could tell that she was almost asleep. She and eight year old Tania shared a large bed. Their Mother was sitting on Dani&#39;s side trying to calm his excitable sister. Hephaestion sat beside&nbsp;Tania, who appeared sad and moody.

&quot;Phia, Mother says that you are to be joined to a king. Where is he going to stay?&quot;

Meeting his mother&#39;s eyes, pain in both of the blue orbs, Hephaestion looked at the oldest sister. She was so much like him.

&quot;I am sure he will be staying in his own home,&quot; Hephaestion answered.

&quot;Oh. Good. I was afraid he was going to take you from us,&quot; the innocent girl said. Like Hephaestion she was guileless of the world around them.&nbsp;Yet Hephaestion had grown up some, since his father had told him of his plan several weeks before. And after his kiss this afternoon, Hephaestion thought that he was now a man.

&quot;I will have to go with him, Tania. I am sure that he will let you visit though.&quot;

&quot;No! I don&#39;t want you to go. Why does he have to take you? I hate him,&quot; she cried, throwing herself into her brothers arms..

&quot;Shh, don&#39;t say these things,&quot; Hephaestion whispered, holding his sister close. &quot;He is going to help father make our city great again. He is going to help us have all the things that little girls should have.&quot; He held the sniffling girl till she fell to sleep.

Callie loosened the hold Dani had on the mewling kitten, as she watched her son and daughter hold each other.

Having lost two sons soon after they were born, she had watched and protected Hephaestion fiercely. She had sheltered her son, scared that she would lose him. And now at sixteen, everything her husband had warned her about was coming true. Her innocent son was being thrown to the wolf at their door.

Callie had always made sure that Hephaestion knew that he was too young to enter the high noble&#39;s court at night. Amnitor had seldom been around. Fighting for the independence of Athens, he had left the raising of his son to his wife. She had woven stories of romance and love. She had always assumed he would find a sweet girl and raise her grandchildren. It was her husband who had noticed when Hephaestion blushed when looking at a handsome boy. And hearing about Alexander&#39;s own preferences, was when his plan had formed.

&quot;Come Hephaestion, it is time for your bedtime. You can tell me about your evening. Your father let you stay in the hall quite late.&quot;

&quot;It is only nine o clock, Mother. I don&#39;t see why I can&#39;t be there.&quot;

Callie smiled at the back of her emerging son, coming from his protective cocoon. Upon entering her sons room several minutes later, she found him curled up in his bed. So innocently beautiful, how could any man resist his charms. She feared this king would never take the time to appreciate the sweet and smart boy that Hephaestion was. If Callie didn&#39;t have her daughters to take care of, she would become recluse, and do penance for what she had allowed happen to her son.

&quot;I met King Alexander today, Mother.&quot;

&quot;And did you like him?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but..........&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion........?&quot; she prompted.

&quot;He kissed me. Today, in the barn. He knew he was coming to become betrothed, and yet he was kissing a strange boy in the barn.&quot; Hephaestion knew that his mother would understand, even if the men hadn&#39;t.

Callie thinking for a moment, knew that she had to say the right thing to her confused son.

&quot;Hephaestion, he was not betrothed when he kissed you. There had been no pledge yet. Is there now?&quot;

&quot;I think so. Father seems to want this.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know. Honey, he is several years older then you and much more experienced. I am sure that the way he was raised in that warring land was much more uncivilized then your own upbringing. In his mind I am sure that he thought that he was doing no wrong. Besides which,&quot;&nbsp;Callie reminder her son, &nbsp;&quot;you too were to become engaged and allowed a man to kiss you in the barn today.&quot;

Hephaestion had not thought about that.

&quot;Oh no! He must think terribly about me. What if he thinks I kiss everybody? He will think I have no morals.&quot;

Callie, thinking about how inexperienced her son&#39;s kiss must have been, smiled to herself.

&quot;I am sure he does not think that, Hephaestion. There is always the argument that you both were swept off your feet from seeing each other and neither of you would have kissed anybody else, but each other.&quot;

Hephaestion brightened at this, which made Callie brave enough to ask her next question.

&quot;Hephaestion, when you were in the barn today; is that all he did was kiss you?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, Mother?&quot;

&quot;Did he touch you in any way?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes. He held me in his arms. It was like you said it would always be. And I felt........never mind,&quot; Hephaestion didn&#39;t think his mother should know that he had felt another mans hardness pressed against his.

Callie smiled. &quot;Did you enjoy the kiss, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;It was so wonderful, Mother.&quot; Hephaestion blushed, remembering his moans and whimpering from earlier that day. &quot;You should get father to kiss you, Mother. It feels good all over.&quot;

Mother and son were quiet for a moment, both lost in their own memories, when another thought came to Hephaestion.

&quot;Mother, what if he wants children?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, he is a king. Of coarse he will have to have a wife. You may want children too.&quot;

&quot;Ew, I don&#39;t want to kiss a girl. And I don&#39;t want him to either,&quot; Hephaestion declared.

&quot;Your marriage is something you are going to have to talk to the king about. And no marriage is perfect. It will be up to you, to make it as joy full as you can. I think however, that the king will just have a wife for children&#39;s sake, so please don&#39;t make yourself sick about it.&quot;

Celeas Amnitor poked his head around the corner.

&quot;Are you two still up? Good evening, my love,&quot; he said, kissing his wife&#39;s cheek. &quot;We are to lunch with Alexander tomorrow. He would like to meet you, my dear. And our beautiful daughters. He said he saw you and Dani in the barn with the kittens today, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Yes, father. That is where he kissed me.&quot;

&quot;Oh please, not that again. Hephaestion, I expect you to be on your best behavior. I have given permission for you to take a walk with him tomorrow after lunch. Can I count on you to to do what&#39;s right?&quot;

Hephaestion, chagrined that his father still didn&#39;t understand. He&nbsp;had only the option to comply to his fathers wishes.

&quot;I will show him the sea rim path. Is that alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but don&#39;t go to the beach. I want the chaperons to stay in the distance. Now go to sleep, Hephaestion, and I will allow you to stay in the court hall tomorrow night.&quot; Meeting his wife&#39;s eyes, he added,&nbsp;&quot;for a little while, that is.&quot;


In the hallway, Callie whispered to her husband.

&quot;I think you need to talk to him. He is completely innocent.&quot;

&quot;I know. Alexander wants him to stay that way. He will be the one to show our son what sex is about.&quot;

&quot;He will be gentle, won&#39;t he Celeas?&quot;

&quot;I think the king is in love with Hephaestion. By Zeus, Callie, this is working out well. As long as Hephaestion&#39;s naughty side doesn&#39;t rear it&#39;s head.&quot;

&quot;Do you know what he told me, Celeas? He said for me to get you to kiss me. That it can be quite enjoyable.&quot;

&quot;Oh, he did, did he? That imp. I suggest we go to our rooms, my dear.&quot;


Later that night, as the companions entered their own small guest palace, joking about the pleasure slaves in Amnitor&#39;s palace; it was Ptolemy who once again brought up the subject of Hephaestion.

&quot;i can&#39;t believe he ran out saying he wouldn&#39;t marry you. You better not let that behavior be accepted, Alexander. You need to curb that&nbsp;rebellion in him right now.&quot;

&quot;He is like a&nbsp;fiery untamed colt. I will not break his spirit. He needs to be coaxed, not forced.&nbsp; He is young, with an innocent&#39;s view of love and romance. And he should have it. It is a marriage after all. I will be gentle, at least at first,&quot; he grinned lecherously. &quot;I will make him want me, so that he can&#39;t think of anything else. I will have him eating out of my hand in no time, you&#39;ll see.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, about what you were talking about earlier today, do you still not care if he takes a lover? Because I find him very desirable.&quot;

Alexander stopped and grabbed Cassander&#39;s arm, swinging him around. Cassander just laughed at Alexander&#39;s anger.

&quot;Relax, my king. I spoke in jest.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, Cassander. I will kill anybody that touches him.&quot; Alexander swept into his private rooms. He trembled from jealousy at the thought of the innocent boy with Cassander. Angered that he even had that feeling&nbsp;over a&nbsp;boy that he had hardly met, just a few hours before.




&quot;Lady Amnitor, I don&#39;t know when I have had more delightful company for lunch. Thank you very much.&quot; Alexander kissed the hand of his betrothed&#39;s mother. She was sweet and very charming. He knew Hephaestion must take after her. The girl Dani was very mischievious, and he had a feeling under&nbsp;his best behavior, Hephaestion was too.

&quot;We are so glad to have you,&quot; the proud woman said. She kissed him on his cheek, asking him if he would like to see her flowers.

&quot;I would love to. I like flowers also. I do not have time to work on them, yet I have a big garden at home.&quot;

&quot;i will go with you, Mother,&quot; young Dani cried.

&quot;You will stay here young lady, and finish your lunch,&quot; Celeas said, grinning at his daughter.

&quot;What are your worries, dear woman?&quot; Alexander asked, when they were alone.

&quot;I need you to know how innocent Hephaestion is.&quot;

&quot;I realize his purity.&quot;

&quot;He has no knowledge of the bedchamber, he is <em>very</em> innocent.&quot;

Callie blushed at her boldness which amused Alexander, who thought them a&nbsp;wonderful family. So unlike his own.

&quot;I wiil delight in his innocence and try to keep his sweetness always a part of him. I will take care of him, my lady.&quot;

Amnitor said from behind them, &quot;Let the man gather his intended and go for a walk, my love. I hope her questions do not bother you, my king. She has been very worried.&quot;

&quot;I wish my own mother had loved me that much. Neither of you need worry. I will take good care of him. Upon my honor, he will want for nothing. Material or emotional.&quot; Alexander bowed before them and left to take his walk with Hephaestion. He had been longing to be somewhat alone with the boy since yesterday. Today he would have chaperons, since Hephaestion had told them of the kiss.

&quot;I like him,&quot; Callie said.

&quot;So do I. He is a king and arrogant though.........&quot;

&quot;.............and Hephaestion can be very stubborn.&quot;

They laughed as they always did, when finishing each other sentences.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Amnitor mused, &quot; that means that they will argue.&quot;

&quot;Of course they will. And they will.........&quot;

&quot;..........make up!&quot;

The two laughed and went in to&nbsp;comfort their daughter who had wanted to walk with her brother and the king.


Alexander and Hephaestion walked in silence to the rim trail that led to the great sea. Alexander reached out and held Hephaestion&#39;s hand, entwining their fingers. He smiled to himself at the blush that crept up Hephaestion&#39;s face. The king was torn between wanting to bed the desirable boy and wanting to enjoy his innocence for a while longer. Again today, his intended wore a sea blue&nbsp;toga style cloth wrapped around him. His tanned smooth skin was doing wonders for Alexander&#39;s libido. He glanced at the guards and chaperons who followed a short distance behind. Cousins of the young lord.

&quot;That is where we&nbsp;are allowed to swim&nbsp;down there,&quot; Hephaestion said wistfully, pointing to a sandy beach and a quiet bay.

&quot;it is a nice day. Do you and your sisters swim often?&quot;

&quot;All the time. But, we have to worry about the slavers from Persia. Father is stretched too thin on security right now for them to watch us.&quot;

&quot;When I rule Persia, the slavers will be no more. Your sisters will be able to swim with just one guardian watching them. I will feel better when our family is safe.&quot;

&quot;Do you really feel that way,&quot; Hephaestion asked breathlessly? Being around this man seem to make his body feel things that he had never felt before. It scared him and excited him at the same time.

&quot;I really do. Your family is now my family to care for, Hephaestion. Because of the way&nbsp;I feel for you, I want their safety and happiness as well as yours.&quot;

Hephaestion grew bold and squeezed&nbsp;the king&#39;s&nbsp;hand before turning to face him.

&quot;Oh, Alexander,&quot; he said, blushing a little from using the kings given name, &quot;I am so happy! You love me!&quot;

Alexander didn&#39;t know if he would call it love or not, but he wouldn&#39;t take the radiant look from the boy&#39;s beautiful face for anything in the world. The next words thrilled him and made him feel like the young man he was, before his fathers death and war, invasion, and the duties of a kingdom had made him forget that both glory <em>and </em>happiness could be his.

Shyly Hephaestion looked down at the beach, before peeking up through his long lashes at the king.

&quot;I.........I love you too.&quot;

Alexander&#39;s answer was to reach out and caress the smooth cheek, running his thumb across the full lips.

&quot;I think it would be all right if you were to make love to me again.&quot; Hephaestion said shyly.&nbsp;&quot;Since we are betrothed.&quot;

&quot;Make love..........? What?&quot;

&quot;You know......Kiss me again.&quot;

This boy was going to keep him entertained in and out of bed, Alexander decided, before lowering his face to touch the trembling lips with his own.

Hephaestion arched into the kiss, longing for the closeness that he had felt yesterday. His body seeking a fulfillment that his mind wasn&#39;t aware of. Alexander having had hundreds of lovers, had never felt anything better&nbsp;then the&nbsp;excitement of feeling the passion exuding from his intended. He didn&#39;t think he would ever tire of it.&nbsp; Hephaestion did not yet know it, but his body craved sex, was made for it, was made for Alexander.

The king groaned into his mouth, which thrilled Hephaestion that this man loved making love to him as much as Hephaestion enjoyed it.

Alexander turned them around, so that it was his back that was turned toward their watchers. He didn&#39;t want them to see his hands. He pulled Hephaestion to him, deepening the kiss. This time, Hephaestion took&nbsp;initiative and twirled his own tongue around Alexander&#39;s. The king was grateful for fast learners and moaned into the kiss.

Alexander ran his hands down the naked shoulders of his lover, surprising the boy when they rested on the full swell of his behind. They felt good there, Hephaestion thought.&nbsp;His body had a will of it&#39;s own. Even as he arched into his intendeds body. His bottom wiggled against the kings hands. He gasped when he felt&nbsp;Alexander cup his cheeks and pull him into his hardness. He couldn&#39;t think. He couldn&#39;t even kiss anymore. He dropped his head to the side, and just writhed against the body holding his. Alexander sucked on the tasty neck that was exposed to him. He wanted to mark the boy. Suck every inch of his skin, and he would someday. He gently rotated his hips, his large phallus fighting with Hephaestion&#39;s, until he felt the telltale shiver of Hephaestion&#39;s impending orgasm. He felt his lover pull back, alarmed and embarrassed. Too far in his desire to stop. Too new at it to know what his body searched for. He had ignored his own bodies awakenings for too long.

&quot;Shh,&quot; Alexander said, grinding their bodies against each other. His lips sucked a little on Hephaestion&#39;s lobe and touched his ear as he whispered, &quot;Shh, let your body go. It needs this. It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve got you.&quot; Alexander felt the shudder, and covered the boys mouth with his own to silence the cry of innocent joy that Hephaestion couldn&#39;t hide. Never. <em>Never</em> in all his life, had Alexander ever seen anything as beautiful as Hephaestion coming undone in his arms.

Hephaestion lay spent&nbsp;within the kings hold. He could feel his hardness, but Alexander seemed to ignore his own body, and Hephaestion was too embarrassed to mention it. He could feel the king reign little kisses all over his face, but he kept his eyes tightly closed. He heard a little amused chuckle at his bashfulness, and felt the king clean him up with the inside of his skirt.

Alexander lifted the face of his lover, to stare into the passion laden eyes..

&quot;It is alright, my love. We are lovers and we are to be joined soon. We have many pleasures&nbsp;that await&nbsp;us. And a lifetime to enjoy them.&quot;

&quot;There is more?&quot;

Alexander watched Hephaestion&#39;s eyes widen, and lightly kissed the swollen lips.

&quot;Much more, my love,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Will you join me again tonight. Perhaps we can eat together. I have to talk to your father about&nbsp;business this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;I would like that, Alexander. Maybe after we are joined, I can be of use in your army. I am smart and strong. I can learn to do things. After all, I will be your husband, not your wife.&quot;

Stubborn little imp, Alexander thought. Although he had a point. Alexander may not want him to fight, but he was sure he could find something for him to do. And they could be together, where Alexander could watch him.

&quot;I would like your help,&quot; he answered, enjoying the happiness on the enticing face.

Hephaestion smiled and bravely held the kings hand as they turned back towards their chaperons. He looked wistfully at the sea.

&quot;I wish we could swim. How many slaves do they need anyway? Why can&#39;t they do some of their own work?&quot;

Alexander didn&#39;t know how they kept this boy so innocent of the world around them, but he thanked the gods that they did.


Later that night, Hephaestion was sitting on the couch of his betrothed. His father sat beside them, on his own couch, with the other nobles and dignitaries all around them. He and Alexander had shared their dinner, and several glasses of wine.&nbsp;Hephaestion had never been allowed so much before, and he couldn&#39;t help but smile at his happiness. It was now past midnight, and Alexander and his father were deep into a war talk, animated in their discussion. Alexander, who had held his hand and been quite attentive all night, turned away from him to talk to his father&#39;s generals.

It was then that Hephaestion started to notice what was going on around him. His head swiveled and he couldn&#39;t help but stare at the actions of men and women right next to him. His betrothed and his father hardly seemed aware of what was going on. Was this what happened when he was sent to bed? Did Alexander and his father indulge in these acts&nbsp;that he saw the married friends of his fathers doing now? Hephaestion was upset, not at the act itself, that was rather interesting. No, he was upset at all the married men who were dishonoring their vows, by using the whores. Is that what he had to look forward to? Alexander forgetting his existence when he was at these celebrations?

Hephaestion was mortified as he watched the doings around him. He glanced around to see if people were watching his innocence of these acts. He watched a long time friend of his fathers kissing a boy who Hephaestion knew to be younger then him. Saw the man bring the boy over his lap, to bury his fingers in the boys behind. Hephaestion felt his face redden. He wanted to look away, but couldn&#39;t. He had never seen or heard about the things that were happening in his own home. With his father and the man he loved sitting right beside him. He never thought these things possible. He had wondered.......but never, ever dreamed..........

&quot;Hephaestion! Hephaestion, we are talking to you.&quot;

Hephaestion heard his fathers voice from a distance. The room had started taking on an other worldly view. It was spinning a little bit. Everywhere things were going on around him. Things that he had never even thought of. Combined with the wine that he had been allowed, he couldn&#39;t seem to give his father his attention.

Both Amnitor and Alexander looked around to see what had claimed Hephaestion&#39;s attention, both coming to the dismayed conclusion at the same time.

Alexander grabbed the boy&#39;s arms and turned him from the view of the room, facing he and his father. He didn&#39;t want his intended to see the depravity of the hall. His innocence was not ready for that. He noticed the flushed look on Hephaestion&#39;s face, and hoped with the amount of wine he had been allowed for the first time, would help him forget the later part of the evening. He saw how the boys shocked eyes couldn&#39;t quite meet his own. He touched the soft cheek, adoring the naive artlessness of his betrothed.

Amnitor was appalled at himself for allowing his innocent son to stay up this late. For all of Hephaestion&#39;s life, he had been sheltered from the immoral and sometimes degenerate acts of late night court life. He had always kept that part of life away from his family. His own remorse at his offense caused him to speak more harshly then he had intended.

&quot;Hephaestion, it is time for you to be in bed. Leave the hall at once!&quot;

&quot;Father, there are other boys here that are younger then me.&quot; Hephaestion didn&#39;t want to be sent from the hall like an errant child. He was betrothed and was turning seventeen in less then two weeks.

&quot;You dare talk back to me?&quot; His father roared, drawing attention from nearby couches. &quot;I am still your father. I said go to bed!&quot;

Hephaestion looked to his intended to see if he might defend his right to be there, but those eyes told the same story.

&quot;I am sorry, Hephaestion. I agree with your father. You should not see such things that you have been sheltered from. When&nbsp;we are joined. Maybe. You are too pure for this, my love.&quot;

Hephaestion felt embarrassing tears come to his eyes. Blushing from being sent from the hall like a child, he rose and walked swiftly from the room without wishing either men a goodnight.

Both Lord Amnitor and King Alexander felt sorry for the young man, yet they knew they were right in sending him to his bed. Such things were not for virgin eyes.

&quot;Do you partake of the pleasures you offer your guests, Lord Amnitor?&quot; Alexander directed his question to his host, but his eyes were still on the empty doorway that Hephaestion had gone through.

&quot;I used to, many years ago. I am old now, and much prefer my own wife who still loves these old bones. And in all honesty,&quot; Celeas whispered. &quot; I realized long ago, that she is the one I most want, and I hated seeing the pain in her eyes when I bedded another. Do not worry Sire, if you want to indulge yourself. You are not yet joined with my son. And you are the king after all.&quot; Amnitor had a feeling that after a few unsatisfying carnal relations while Hephaestion waited in his bed would make Alexander come to the same conclusions he had. Amnitor knew love when he saw it. Alexander might have to take a few knocks before he truly recognized it. After another glass of wine, Amnitor asked his fellow high ranking noble to take over as host, and bid his king goodnight.

Alexander didn&#39;t need a man&#39;s permission to gratify his own body. And no matter how he felt about Hephaestion, he wasn&#39;t going to let some young boy dictate his actions. He spotted a young man who had just finished bringing in more food, and was now sipping a stolen glass of wine. He was a slave and didn&#39;t expect niceties. Alexander who had made his way over, kissed the young man. He didn&#39;t have Hephaestion&#39;s sweet fresh breath or his quivering full lips. Though he was experienced and knew how to kiss, which contrarily made Alexander hunger for the awakening passion of Hephaestion&#39;s innocent kiss. Angered at his thoughts, he pulled the boy into the corridor and around the corner.

Alexander pushed the boy against the wall, turning him to face it. He bent to kiss his neck, but he smelled faintly of old sweat and garlic. He was glad his betrothed had a fresh and minty smell from bath soaps. Well, he didn&#39;t want to kiss the boy anyway. He&nbsp;lowered the peasant trousers that the Athenians wore and rubbed his hand over the thin behind. He pushed into the boy with no preparation and noticed that he had already been used that night. Slightly sickened by his actions,&nbsp;Alexander finished quickly. He had the release of sexual tension, but felt no satisfaction. He cleaned himself on the slaves shirt and covered himself back up. When&nbsp;Alexander turned around he met the shocked and pain filled eyes of his betrothed. He noticed the disillusioned face turn to betrayal and anger.

&quot;I hate you,&quot; Hephaestion hissed, tears now streaming down his face. He turned and ran down the hall and into the family&#39;s wing of the palace. He ordered the guards to not let anyone pass.

Alexander not wanting to fight with his hosts personal guard resigned himself to do some fast talking tomorrow. This afternoon had been so wonderful for them both, and now Alexander had ruined it all. His stomach twisted as&nbsp;the thought of&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s&nbsp;anguished eyes. The pain making them darken to midnight blue. His chest ached, and he decided to just go to his own bed.

Cleitus fell into step beside him. He had witnessed the last moment of Alexander&#39;s copulation, as he had just finished his own release from another boy. Cleitus had seen Hephaestion coming and tried to get to the boy to turn him back. He had been too late. Hephaestion had seen and ran&nbsp;from the scene. Cleitus&nbsp;saw his king barred from the rooms of the jealous boy he was pledged to.

&quot;Well so much for having him eating out of your hand.&quot;

&quot;Oh do shut up, Cleitus.&quot;</font></lj-cut>"

<lj-cut><font size=""2""><font size=""3"">This is an Alternate Universe story


Celeas Amnitor had fallen on hard times. His outer lands had been seized by the Macedonians years before. With no taxes coming in, he had used his own considerable wealth to fund Southern Greece&#39;s army. He had taken them as far as could in the fight to retain independence. The fight was over, he had lost, and now he had to think about his people. People&nbsp;who did not want to wage war only to lose, then turn around and pledge allegiance to the king who had conquered them. With his wealth almost gone, Celeas had only one commodity. His son. He had four daughters, all under the age of eight, too young to consider bartering them at their age. Besides, he hoped for a match with the Macedon king, and it was rumored that he preferred boys. So Amnitor had put out word that he would sell his son in return for a friendly alliance. His son was not to be sold as a servant, not even as an eromenos. He was to be given the honor of contractual consort. Celeas had made a starting price, asking the parties to bid on his son. Not publicly of course. Celeas Amnitor had lost even more money keeping his army going for the pretense of strength during the long months it had taken to set up his plan. He made his offer to both King Darius of Persia and King Alexander of Macedon. Suspicions ran rampant on both sides. Finally an agreement was made for the King of Macedonia and Bessos, the second in command of the Persian empire to meet at Amnitor&#39;s palace. They would both bring their own small guard, larger armies staying behind. Both sides had sent spies and diplomats to assure themselves of their leaders safety. Not wanting to appear too desperate, Celeas had even made the offer to the Republic of Rome.&nbsp;With a foothold in Athens, that nation could begin their own movement eastward. Although Amnitor expected a negative reply from Rome, he received confirmation that Rome&#39;s emissary would indeed be there. It took several more months for travel. Both Persia and Rome were sailing in, so Amnitor had to go to extra added expense for sea security. The money he would receive was a fortune. Amnitor had a large family of his own with many unmarried cousins on his wife&#39;s side.

Convincing his son had been the hardest thing he had ever done. Hephaestion&#39;s eyes had looked at him as if he had been betrayed by his own father. Being the loyal Athenian, as well as son and brother, Hephaestion had accepted his fate. In the young prince&#39;s mind, he didn&#39;t have to make the life of whatever arrogant king who bought him any better. Father and son had not been close for months.


Alexander wondered if things would be this way if his father hadn&#39;t died. Athens had gotten powerful. Not so powerful that they couldn&#39;t be beaten. However, Alexander wanted their city and their considerable army as friendly allies, rather then defeated followers.

Three years after his father&#39;s death,&nbsp;the twenty three year old king&nbsp;was finally ready to invade Persia. Through negotiations and some fighting he had amassed a considerable army of his own. Only one quarter the size of Persia&#39;s. But it would not be numbers that would win that war. He knew the Persians were scared, as&nbsp;they had already offered him large areas of land in return of his leaving them alone. Alexander wanted it all. He sent a negative reply. Also telling them that for right now they had nothing to worry about. After all Alexander was riding into Athens, virtually unguarded. He counted on the Persians to believe that his army wasn&#39;t far behind.

When Alexander received the unprecedented offer from Celeas Amnitor, he knew the man had rallied his last reserves, and was giving the false appearance of a strength he did not have. It was a good ploy. The boy really had nothing to do with it. Amnitor needed a way out of the corner he had backed himself into. If Persia bought young Amnitor, it would not defeat Alexander. To lose the allegiance of Athens however, meant that he would have to wage war&nbsp;upon that respected city before Persia even tried to take hold. So he decided he would take the boy off Amnitor&#39;s hands, gain allegiance and land, more men who would be willing to fight for him and the honor of Greece. He would be giving&nbsp;Athens back her dignity.

Alexander had to wonder though, why an almost seventeen year old boy wasn&#39;t the eromenos of some high ranking Greek. He was well bred after all. Nobody must have wanted him. The boy must surely be of ugly face and body for Amnitor to offer him for such a price that was nothing to Alexander.

Cleitus, Ptolemy and Cassander rode beside their king with the agreed upon twenty-five royal guard. They felt sure it could be a trap, and if it were then they would all lose their lives. Regardless of that fact, they were not sending their king in alone. Leaving Antipetar in charge, they left for Athens. They felt proud that Alexander was the only Royal who dared make the trip. Granted it was through their own lands, and it was far for the others. But to officially bind yourself to a boy in what was relatively a marriage, Alexander thinking of Athenian and Macedonian relations had made the trip. He felt certain he would come home with the boy. He would have to consummate the union with the creature, but then he could leave him in the hands of his mother. It&#39;s not as if the boy could give him children. Or even be of any use in his army. Or else he would already be in the ranks of Athenian soldier&#39;s. Alexander had already led troops by the time he was the boys age. What would Alexander want him around for?

The men rode on mostly the coastal path. Keeping east of Mount Olympus, giving homage as they passed the home of the Gods. They rode down through Larissa and Pheres, lodging in both towns. With few towns in between, they had to ride a little bit west in order to avoid a bay,&nbsp; They stayed overnight in both Trachis and Chaeronea. There was only a few miles between them and Athens, yet the group decided to lodge one more night in the town of Marathon, in order to ride into Athens fresh from a nights slumber and a good bath. They had decided to bypass Thebes. They had fought a long and bloody battle in that city a year and a half before. Nobody wished to revisit without the main army behind them.

With the invasion of Sparta and Corinth, and the lands north of Athens, Alexander owned most of Greece. And with the agreement of Amnitor&#39;s, he would be king of all Greece. Except for Mount Olympus, he controlled much of the civilized world.

The Macedonians had been riding through lush lands and rolling hills.

&quot;Most of what you see here has been put to wheat,&quot; Alexander said to any who listened. &quot;The closer we get to Athens, the soil and the heat is prime conditions for olives and grapes. It is the main source of wealth for the high nobles of Athens. The farming and making of wine and olive oil provides most of the city with work.&quot;

&quot;Then why does Amnitor need to sell his son for our alliance if they are so wealthy?&quot;

Ptolemy had never been one to listen to lessons or take an interest in the history of the lands they invaded. Both Cleitus and Cassander rode in silence, yet listened avidly to their kings story.

&quot;The crops are still good, Ptolmey. We own the surrounding area. We have effectively cut off all source of trade and sale for Athens.&quot;

&quot;Why are we here on this fools errand? Why don&#39;t we just take the city?&quot;

&quot;They have a culture here that is better then our own. A rich history and education I wish for our own people. It is worth the price of a few coins to have these people unite as our allies and not be a reluctant army. Which by the way, this city has a trained infantry that outshines our own. It is ten thousand strong. And they will fight for Alexander. For I will have a formal pledge of cohabitation with one of their own. And I will open trade for their wine and olive oil. They will be prosperous under my rule.&quot;

&quot;Except that you have to give up your freedom, Alexander,&quot; Cassander joked.

&quot;Zeus knows what kind of boy you are going to be bound to,&quot; Cleitus laughed.

&quot;Bound too? I will not be bound to him. He will set no limits on my freedom. He is just a means to an end, and he will be the one that will be confined by his bonds. I doubt I will remember his face after our first night. In truth I do not care if he takes a lover, if anyone will have him. Somebody may want him because he is the kings consort. It&#39;s not as if I have to worry about a child that is not my own.&quot;

The men were quiet as they finally entered the great city. Buildings were old, with ivy and hibiscus growing along many homes. They saw buildings marked as schools and hospitals for both men and women. The people in the streets were courteous and bowed to Alexander, but not enough to appear submissive. They passed buildings that were used as forums for law. The people outside these places had an arrogance that made his companions scoff at their Athenian airs, but Alexander could respect pride and self worth. It was what he felt himself.

Stopping at an outdoor cantina, the four friends enjoyed refreshment before moving on. The wine was excellent and pure. He allowed the soldiers a glass or two, along with a tray of breads, cheese, olives, baked atichokes and meats. They were told of the ancient monuments that adorned their city. Deciding to prolong the last leg of their journey, they rode by the monuments the inn keeper had told them about. Alexander was an avid reader, and knew about the places they saw, so that he was able to talk about them to his companions. They rode by the Parthenon and Chalcothce, the temple of Asclepius. They were all happy to see the temple of Dionysus. They made time to go by the sanctuary of Artimus and the temple of Athena Nike. For Alexander who dreamed of seeing things he had only read about, hoped he could find time to tour these places before he left again. It would be enjoyable to do so with somebody who was as interested as he was. Alexander noted the boredom on his friends and the soldiers faces.

It was another hour and a half ride to Amnitor&#39;s&nbsp;home by the sea. Alexander led the way.

The Macedonians arrived at the palace of Athens highest noble. Over a century before, the Athenians did away with an actual king. The highest nobles were the rich men who owned the olives and grapes. The men who handled the import and export of their products. And these nobles ran the city as a democracy. At least a democracy as they saw it. There were slaves and the servants were not paid well. The farmers who fed them did not make much, and often had to resort to drastic measures to take care of their families. These measures included the sale of their beautiful sons and daughters to the oft times flesh buyers of Persia. Slavers. Alexander would change all that.

The king dismounted with the rest of the group and was ready to hand over the reins of his beloved horse to the court groom, when out of the corner of his eye he spotted a boy of great beauty enter the barn from a different direction.

&quot;I wish to inspect the barns, to see to the health of our horses. The hay may be a little dusty.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, you shouldn&#39;t.......&quot;

&quot;Stay here. I&#39;ll be right back, Cleitus.&quot;

Alexander heard girlish giggles when he entered the barn. He was disappointed. The beautiful young man was meeting a girl. As he listened more, he heard that the girl was a child.

&quot;Oh Phai, do you think father will let me have one?&quot;

&quot;He will do anything during the next few days to make you girls happy. I think you should ask him now.&quot;

&quot;You get one too. I know you have always wanted a cat.&quot;

&quot;Shh, someone may hear,&quot; the boy joked. &quot;Boys are not supposed to have cats. Besides someday I want a fluffy persian kitten. I&#39;ll hold out for him.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re funny, Phai.&quot;

&quot;I know. I&#39;m a riot. Run along now sister. I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;

As Alexander saw the pretty young girl run out the side door, he looked around the stall to see the boy who had caught his attention. What he saw made his breath catch. The slim Athenian youth was on his hands and knees, putting kittens back with their mother. He wore a sleeveless shirt and the thin trousers of a peasant boy. Alexander could see the outline of his shapely thighs, and his arms were tanned and had the smooth skin of youth. Alexander&#39;s eyes fixated on the slave&#39;s bottom. Kneeling as he was, he had lifted it high in the air. It looked firm and delectably round. The pert curves ignited Alexander&#39;s hunger. He felt his cock grow hard as he stepped forward. In his land, slaves were open game for visiting royals, and he wanted this boy.

Hephaestion turned when he heard the steps of a man. He stood up quickly when he saw the blond haired soldier advancing on him with lust in his eyes.

&quot;I am not a slave, sir.&quot;

Alexander stopped and gathered himself. He was almost glad the boy had stopped him. Otherwise he might not have seen the face before him. Shoulder length dark chestnut hair&nbsp;was feathered around his face, making his forehead and high cheek bones look perfect. His lips were full and inviting. Alexander couldn&#39;t wait to kiss them and see them stretched around his shaft. It was the boy&#39;s eyes that brought out Alexander&#39;s tenderness. They were as blue as the sea that could be seen in the distance.&nbsp; Large and expressive, framed by long thick lashes. Alexander would lose himself in those eyes as they darkened with desire from the things that the king would do to him. This boy was more then a treat. He was a feast. No, Alexander wouldn&#39;t take him here. He would take him to his bed to seduce him and enjoy him. If only his future consort would look like this boy.

Hephaestion watched the soldier look at him, and took advantage to stare himself. The soldier was blond like the sun god. Not so big that he was scary,&nbsp;hard and muscular was the slim build. Hephaestion could see scars from battle and they thrilled him. The way the soldier was looking at him, made him feel warm. If only one of of the kings who were coming to buy him would look like this man. Hephaestion nearly melted when he heard&nbsp;the timber&nbsp;of the man&#39;s voice.

&quot;Alright, you are not a slave for the taking,&quot; Alexander said gruffly.&nbsp;&quot;Pity. Might I have one kiss though? Just one?&quot;

Hephaestion wanted to be bold. He might as well have one kiss from somebody like this man. A kiss he could think about through the years. It would be his first.

&quot;One kiss, soldier,&quot; he whispered.

Alexander gently pulled the trembling boy into his arms to hold him close. He saw the lashes flutter as he lowered his lips. The boy jumped a little at first contact, then warmed under Alexander&#39;s own lips. The kiss started off gentle, and grew to ravenous heights, heat radiating from them both. Alexander could tell the boy had never been kissed and was innocent in the ways of men. His inexperience made Alexander harden even more, and he pressed his hardness into the servant&#39;s own swelling body. The friction caused a whimper from the boy as he arched into the contact. Alexander could tell when a child&#39;s fear and inexperience changed to a young mans first exciting feelings of desire. Alexander was thrilled to be able to be the one to release the boys pent up passion. The king had never tasted such a sweet mouth. He twirled his tongue around that of the boys, once in a while stopping to suck on the boys tongue, and lap at the swollen lips. The boy was writhing now, moaning loud and lost in the feeling of first&nbsp;time desire. He was Alexander&#39;s for the taking. But not here in the straw. He would arrange for the boy to come to his bed after the court festivities.

&quot;Ale, are you here?&quot; Cleitus seldom used the pet name for the king. His protective instincts kicked in, and it just came out. He was worried about the king when several moments passed, and thought it best to look for him.

The king felt the boy pull out of his arms. Arms that felt empty without the Athenian in them. Alexander looked around for his general, and when he turned back, the boy was gone. Without arranging for an evening tryst. Damn.



The people of Athens knew how to entertain. Each of the invited guests had their own quarters. With barracks for the soldiers and rooms for each of Alexander&#39;s companions. The king himself had a suite of rooms fit for a king. Slaves had been sent to ready baths that were like swimming pools and to have a feast of food for the soldiers. Even pleasure slaves should they want them. Alexander&#39;s guard were quick to take up the suggestive offers.

Later at the festivities in the main palace, Alexander&#39;s companions, after meeting their host, left to seek out other pleasures. They had left Celeas and Alexander talking and sharing small pitcher of wine.

&quot;I can&#39;t just sell him to you right now, Alexander. I wish for Hephaestion to meet you first. He might take a shine to other offers.&quot;

&quot;How can he judge when Darius and Titus are not even here. You know I want this union. I don&#39;t want to be harsh Lord Amnitor, we will take these lands. We would rather do it without the ruination of your city. You offer a way. I want this matter over with.&quot;

&quot;I was afraid of that. What of Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;He wil be your means to recoup your losses. He will bind our lands and be treated fairly and with respect.&quot;

&quot;What of love?&quot;

&quot;When you put your son on the auction block, do not expect a love match. Have Persia or Rome made an offer for the boy?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;No. Nor will they. They are here to assess the situation. Assess your weakness. We will show them your might with me at your side. My offer is fair for a drowning man, Lord Amnitor.&quot;

&quot;I still must talk to my son first.&quot; Celeas was starting to feel a fathers guilt and fear, now that the plan was coming to fruition.

&quot;Do so. I will enjoy your hospitality tonight, and we will talk business on the morrow. I will meet Hephaestion this evening if possible.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sire. I will bring him to you. I am sure he will be quite amenable.&quot;


Alexander found Cleitus and Cassander watching something down below the balcony they were standing on. Ptolemy was sitting on a couch, rubbing his hands over a slave girl.

&quot;What are you looking at,&quot; Alexander asked as he approached?

&quot;That servant boy with Bessos, the Persian emissary. He is exquisite, Alexander. We have never seen a more beautiful boy.&quot;

Alexander already knowing who he would see, looked over the railing. The beauty from this afternoon was handing the Persian a glass of wine. He was dressed brightly in a jade green toga style cloth. Sandals adorned his slim feet. Alexander watched the boy flirt innocently with Bessos. Saw the blue eyes flash and the flutter of his long lashes. The boy may be completely&nbsp;innocent in the ways of flesh, but he wasn&#39;t new to flirtation. Alexander was growing angry at every smile bestowed on the leering Persian.

&quot;Ah, I see you have found Hephaestion. Hard not to spot in that toga. My son dresses the way that he likes.&quot; Amnitor said as he joined them at the railing.

Alexander looked to see where his host was looking. Straight at his lover from this afternoon!

By the gods, what luck, Alexander thought! The servant that he was so infatuated with was his betrothed. What irony is fate. He would have to have a serious talk with his intended about kissing soldiers in barns. And about other certain things Alexander expected. Complete fidelity. Never mind what he said that afternoon to his friends. He would have this boys faithfulness.

Alexander saw the Persian reach out and pull the boy to him, at the same time backing them into a dark corner. Alexander saw the momentary flash of annoyance giving way to fear&nbsp;in the boys eyes. And without waiting for Amnitor, he rushed down the stairs to rescue his betrothed.

Alexander heard Cassander and Cleitus yell to Ptolemy and run down the steps after him. He threw himself into the corner, pushing back the groping Persian and pulling Hephaestion into his arms. The Persian came right back back at Alexander, but by that time, his companions were there to block his assault.

&quot;Sir, is this how you conduct yourself as an invited guest in my home? By assaulting my son?!&quot;

&quot;He wanted it,&quot; the Persian grinned evilly.

&quot;Liar,&quot; Alexander spat!

&quot;The invitation to Darius has been rescinded. I will have my soldiers escort you to your ships. They will wait with you for the dawn, where you will sail from my borders at first light. I will send a letter to Darius informing him of your conduct.&quot;

&quot;Why would he care if I tried to bed the whore you sell,&quot; Bessos smirked, before gathering his men to leave the hall.

Alexander watched him with hatred in his eyes. When he invaded Persia, he would stop at nothing to insure that man&#39;s death. Alexander was impressed with Amnitor&#39;s reaction. A proud old warrior, who Alexander would welcome into his family.

Meanwhile Hephaestion clung to his soldier from this afternoon, breathing in his fresh scent. He was no longer frightened, however this might be his last chance to be next to the man he had been daydreaming about all day.

Alexander soothed him with senseless whispers, holding the intoxicating form as close as he could without angering the father.

&quot;Hephaestion, you forget yourself,&quot; Amnitor scolded. &quot;Step back and meet the king of Macedon in a proper way.&quot;

Stricken by his fathers words, Hephaestion did indeed step back out of the soldiers arms. And not just any soldier, the king of Macedonia. Soon to be king of all Greece if his father was correct.

&quot;You.......you are Alexander?&quot; he asked, looking at the blond haired god. His first thought had been overwhelming joy, which rapidly changed to jealousy. It did not matter if the jealousy was about his own self. He did not care if it were unreasonable.

&quot;Yes, I am Alexander, child.&quot;

&quot;I am not a child. I am seventeen&nbsp;in two&nbsp;weeks.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Alexander said softly. He sensed a tantrum coming on. &quot;No, you are not a child. Shall I call you Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;No, you may not,&quot; Hephaestion cried.

&quot;Why? What is wrong? I hoped you would be as glad as I am to find out who we are to each other.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion! Enough! What goes on here?&quot;

&quot;Father, he kissed me today. Earlier, in the barn.&quot;

&quot;I knew you had somebody in there,&quot; Cleitus snorted. &quot;What a find. Well done, my friend.&quot; He was astounded at the glare he received from the Athenian beauty.

&quot;I don&#39;t see the problem,&quot; Amnitor said. &quot;Since he has made an offer for you. Of course he might want to kiss you.&quot; Amnitor looked towards the king. &quot;He has been very sheltered, you understand.&quot;

&quot;I am glad of his innocence,&quot; Alexander said as if Hephaestion wasn&#39;t standing right there, which inflamed the young man.

&quot;Don&#39;t you see, father? This was before he knew who I was. He came here to become betrothed, and tried to bed a servant boy. He was being unfaithful before he even met his intended.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you <em>are </em>his intended.&quot;

&quot;But, he didn&#39;t know that at the time!&quot; Hephaestion cried as he glared at Alexander. &quot;Is this the way you intend to act? Trying to&nbsp;kiss anybody you want, right under my nose? No matter how I feel?&quot;

&quot;How do you feel?&quot;

&quot;I ......I.......Oh never mind! I don&#39;t care. Don&#39;t accept his offer, father. I can not marry this man.&quot; Hephaestion hurried away from the laughing men. He was embarrassed by his outburst. Why did these things have to happen to him?

Amnitor was shaking his head at Hephaestion&#39;s abrupt departure. He had never seen his son more flustered. If he didn&#39;t know better, he would think that Hephaestion had developed feelings for the king. And the way Alexander had rushed down the stairs to rescue the boy..........well this was too good to be true. He couldn&#39;t wait to tell his lady wife. He hoped he could appease the king&nbsp;of his son&#39;s temper.

&quot;I am sorry for my son&#39;s words, Sire. I assure you he does not normally show such bad behavior.&quot;

&quot;Lord Amnitor, do not apologize for your son, He shows a fine temperament. I am not angry. In fact, I am delighted that he has such spirit.&quot;

The companions wandered away to give Alexander time with his future in law. They were happy for their king in the fine match he had made.They thought the young man would give the king a run for his money. Maybe that&#39;s what Alexander needed. Somebody to defy him.&nbsp;Give him a fun battle for once.

When Alexander looked at his host, all he saw was a father&#39;s pride in his beautiful and spirited boy. As well he should, the king thought. Alexander was delighted with the boys animated liveliness. The boy was willing to face the danger of a kings wrath all because of some misplaced jealousy. Alexander knew that Hephaestion would bring that spirit to their bed. Lord Amnitor was shocked at what he deemed bad behavior from his son. In truth, Alexander would not tolerate embarrassing behavior in public either. Fortunately, he knew how to tame a naughty prince.</font></font>

epilogue</font>

<lj-cut><font size=""3"">&quot;I can&#39;t believe Cleitus gave you bells as wedding present,&quot; Hephaestion snarled as he stomped into their rooms. 

He was talking about the ankle and wrist bracelets that Alexander had received at his party. They were strips of rawhide, adorned with several little gold bells tied onto each of the four bracelets. They were finely crafted, and had a wonderful sound. Alexander was sure they must have cost a lot of money, and had probably been ordered long before Cleitus had even heard of the king&#39;s marriage. Alexander sighed. His lover had been in a&nbsp;confrontational mood ever since Alexander had informed him that he was marrying Roxanne.

Hephaestion continued his tirade, unaware of his lovers thoughts.

&quot;He has talked about giving you bells for years. <em>For me.</em> Now he gives them to you as a wedding present? He probably thinks that slutty dancer you are marrying will know just what to do with them,&quot; Hephaestion challenged.

&quot;First of all, I am sure Cleitus meant the gift to be for you to wear for me.&quot;

&quot;As if I will do that now!&quot;

Alexander continued as if Hephaestion hadn&#39;t spoken, which he could tell inflamed his lover.

&quot;Second of all, that was beneath you. I know this is hard on you, however there is no need for this insecurity.&quot;

&quot;<em>First of all</em>,&quot; Hephaestion said sarcastically, &quot;&quot;I am not insecure! <em>Second of all,</em> you&nbsp;defend her now?&quot;

&quot;I am not defending her to you, Hephaestion. Regardless of that fact, she is not a slut.&quot;

&quot;I too saw the dance she gave you. It&#39;s in her heart, believe me.&quot; Hephaestion was snide. &quot;You sure have a thing for dancers, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Why are you being like this? It is so unlike you. Is it all right if I feel the tiniest attraction for the woman who is to give me children? This is hard on me too, you know. Hephaestion, you know how much I love you. How much I still desire you. Only you.&quot;

Hephaestion turned his face away from his lover. He was embarrassed of the way he was acting. He couldn&#39;t seem to stop himself.

&quot;I am sorry, my love. I can&#39;t seem to help that I don&#39;t like the thought of her being with you. I will get over it. I understand though. You know I do. I just don&#39;t like her.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you will like any woman I marry.&quot;

&quot;Not so. I like Starteria.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because I did not desire her.&quot;

&quot;Like you do this wench? Is that it?&quot;

Alexander looked at one of his wedding presents from Hephaestion, before he set them down. Where as most of his companions had given him traditional gifts, meant for the bride and groom. Goblets, blankets, robes for the married couple. Cleitus had given him the matched sets of bells, knowing where his heart lay. Hephaestion had given him beautiful horse blankets, and a simple set of carved ivory. A pair of dice, that had been crafted from the tusks of the great beast, that they had only seen in pictures. Alexander ran his hands along the polished ivory. He knew what was wrong with his lover. He was jealous. Although a part of him felt bad for his beautiful beloved. A part of him also felt glad that he was still loved so much by his handsome general.

&quot;My love. My beautiful Hephaestion. You will always be it for me. She knows this. Her family knows this. Although I am respectful of them, I have not tried to hide us. I haven&#39;t even suggested that you leave the kings tent. I want you with me always.&quot;

Hephaestion&#39;s moment of contrition was gone. 

&quot;The kings tent? The <em>kings</em> tent! I thought this was our tent. Our rooms when we are in palace. Now I have to fear getting kicked out of my home because of her or your next wife&#39;s whims? Fine, I might as well leave right now!&quot;

Alexander took a deep breath. He was trying to be patient, but his lover was starting to anger him. For all of Hephaestion&#39;s power and intelligence, he sometimes could be quite maddening.

&quot;Hephaestion, you know I want you here. You are just trying to find fault in whatever I say. I realize that you are upset and jealous. I would be too. But you have.............&quot;

&quot;Upset! Jealous! I am neither of those things.&quot;

&quot;Good. Then come to bed.&quot;

No more was said. Hephaestion undressed and got into bed. He crawled to the very far side and turned his back to his lover.

Sometimes, Alexander thought, Hephaestion&#39;s actions were cute and adorable. Other times he was reminded of his sister and mother. His actions were like a woman&#39;s.. Alexander waited for lightning to strike him. Or for Hephaestion to sense what he was thinking, and rise from the bed like a fury and start beating on him in a purely masculine way.

When neither happened, he crawled in beside his lover, and reached over to haul Hephaestion back into his arms. Alexander would not attempt lovemaking, but he would be damned if he wasn&#39;t going to hold his lover. He was getting married tomorrow. Admittedly when he first saw Roxanne she did excite him in a small way. He was seldom attracted to women. It was a perfect opportunity to unite tribes, and marry someone who he could at least get an erection for. His companions were angry that his first wife wasn&#39;t Macedonian. Hephaestion just didn&#39;t like her. He thought she was coarse and vulgar, and couldn&#39;t believe that Alexander could be attracted to her. It had caused a rift in their relationship for days now. He just wanted this to be over. Hopefully she could produce new life fast and he could send her back to Babylon. Hephaestion moved, touching Alexander&#39;s cock with his behind. Alexander gritted his teeth and closed his eyes. He begged for Morpheus to send him sleep.

Hephaestion lay awake. He was hard from having his kings arms around him, and his cock wedged up against his ass. He was too ashamed to turn and initiate sex. He knew he would have to make amends to his patient lover. But not tonight. Tonight he just felt like being jealous and hurt, wishing it could be different for them.

Hephaestion lay awake for&nbsp;another hour. Tonight he lay in his kings arms. Tomorrow though, Alexander would be married. Tomorrow he would lie in his wife&#39;s arms. Hephaestion wanted a baby from this union. For his king. But, he didn&#39;t want Alexander to lusty for her. He had felt when Alexander succumbed to sleep. Tough. Let him be tired on his wedding night. Hephaestion slowly turned and slithered down. He didn&#39;t touch Alexander anywhere until he reached the cock that had given him such pleasure. He loved Alexander&#39;s phallus. He opened wide to engulf it in the heat of his mouth, swirling his tongue around the growing member.&nbsp;He loved to feel it swell in his mouth. He moaned from the pleasure he received from sucking his lover awake. The heat and suction combined with the vibrations from Hephaestion&#39;s throat caused Alexander to arch into the warm mouth, his hips rising from the bed to seek more of the wonderful feeling. Hephaestion wrapped his arms right around his lover&#39;s ass and lower back, lifting him close to his ravenous mouth. Moment&#39;s before he felt Alexander&#39;s balls tighten, he could hear the short breaths his lover made before completion. Hephaestion stopped his ministrations. He kissed his way back up Alexander&#39;s body. He lapped at his kings lips before sliding his tongue inside Alexander&#39;s mouth, letting him taste his own sweet flavor. He straddled his lover, sitting up straight, he reached behind and positioned Alexander&#39;s cock at his own entrance, to slowly lower himself down upon the steel like rod.

Alexander watched his lovers face in the flickering light. Saw the wince from being stretched. After all these years, Hephaestion was still so tight it took his breath away. He ran his hand along his lovers strong thighs. So smooth and satiny, he could feel the strain under his hands, the tightness of the muscles. He reached around to feel Hephaestion&#39;s ass, when his lover grabbed both of his hands and leaned forward. He held the hands above Alexander&#39;s head, staring down on him while he rocked his hips and rode his lover&#39;s cock.

&quot;You can be nice to her, Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion whispered in a husky voice. &quot;You can give her gifts and certain freedoms. But make no mistake. She was ambitious and wanted to marry a king. I have no sympathy for the lack of love in her marriage. She could have married a mountain boy and fell in love, like my own sister. So you just fuck her, Alexander. Don&#39;t give her what we have. This sharing. It is ours, and it&nbsp;belongs to us.&quot;

Alexander nodded, staring up at his beloved. Hephaestion was beautiful. So young looking and desirable beyond all belief. His hair was hanging down around his face. His moist lips were red from passion and slightly parted. It was his eyes that Alexander couldn&#39;t look away from. They held all of Hephaestion&#39;s emotions in their blue depths.

Hephaestion let go of Alexander&#39;s hands, so that he could brace himself on his lover&#39;s chest. He felt like riding hard. He tightened his muscles around his lover&#39;s cock and started to move faster.

&quot;Prepare to be tired tomorrow, my love. Tonight I will give you no reprieve.&quot;

So be it, Alexander thought. He was a soldier. He could take this exquisite torture. He reached down and lubricated his beloved&#39;s cock with it&#39;s own juices, stroking it, while enjoying the hot confines of Hephaestion&#39;s body.


Hephaestion had stayed quiet during the ceremony. The other companions left him alone. Though they didn&#39;t really understand. None of them had ever had a love like he and Alexander&#39;s. Few people were ever fortunate to ever find that. It had taken Hephaestion a thousand years. Of course it had taken Alexander only one lifetime, but he was charmed. As were Achilles and Patroclus who had found love during their first life. So Hephaestion stood by himself, watching his lover make the vows that they had made themselves years before. Privately of course. Hephaestion could hardly look away. He watched them at the long dinner table as they sat together, sharing a plate as was custom. Drinking from the same goblet. Hephaestion could not help but watch, and simply ignored the painful lump that rose in his chest. In spite of telling himself it did not matter, there was still a part of himself that felt betrayed, that Alexander belonged to him. All he could do was stand and watch. He could not fight for his love. Could not rail at him, could do nothing to separate him from this woman. And it hurt. To Hephaestion, Alexander seemed fine. His only hesitation came was when he looked at Hephaestion. So in order to avoid the indecision and uncertainty, he tried not to look at his&nbsp;despondent &nbsp;lover.

The ceremony was over. The toasts had been made and drank to. Alexander had honored his companions. Even dinner had been consumed. Though there would be revelry long into the night, another hour and it would be time for Alexander and his bride to retire. Hephaestion could only hope he could hold up that long. He would go to their bed and try to sleep. Maybe he would take a large flask of wine with him. He had already given Alexander a ring he had found years before. He had given it to him after their third bout of lovemaking the night before. He had wanted his lover to know that he was loved this night. That he knew in his heart that he was the true love of Alexander.

Alexander found it hard not to tremble. In less then an hour he would be laying with his wife.. He was ashamed to admit that he did desire her. And upset that Hephaestion realized that. Was it a betrayal? He didn&#39;t think so. But you never could tell what Hephaestion was thinking. He heard the murmuring, saw his friends looking towards the west, but it was Hephaestion that drew his attention. His lover looked startled, like he had seen a ghost. He shook off Cassander&#39;s hand abruptly and started walking to the edge of the party, Alexander watched amazed as <em>his</em> lover started to run. He looked quickly to where Hephaestion was running, and stood up in shock. For there was Ansell, tall and beautiful in his splendor. Unchanged from the passing years. Beside him stood another blond. Just as attractive, yet softer somehow. He watched Hephaestion reach them. He seemed to hesitate for a moment, as if he could not believe what his eyes were seeing. And then he launched himself into the blonds arms. Not Ansell&#39;s., but the other man.&nbsp; Hephaestion was picked up and swung around before he was set on his feet and&nbsp;simply held. Alexander watched as&nbsp;his beloved&nbsp;lifted his lips to be kissed by the newcomer, and was then passed to Ansell for another huge hug and kiss on the lips. 

In that moment Alexander knew that his lover had lied to him. Lied when he told Alexander that <em>he</em> was his only love. He stood up to go over to the trio. It was Ptolemy who pulled him back into his seat, nodding to his new family. To his bride, who was looking at him in what she supposed was a hurt look. When really, what Alexander saw in her eyes was anger and hatred when they looked at Hephaestion. He would have to watch out for that.

He looked back over at Hephaestion, who was back in the newcomers arms with his head buried in the mans neck. Ansell was holding them both. His lover looked like he was weeping right there during the wedding celebrations of his king. As he watched, he realized that these were the actions of lovers. When? How? His&nbsp;queen be damned, he was going over! He started to rise just as the gong sounded for the retirement of the king and his new bride. He would go to her rooms. He would never&nbsp;during all their marriage invite her to his.

Hephaestion separated from Achilles and Patroclus to look for Alexander. His lover was staring at him with pain filled eyes. Patroclus whispered to him and he saw Achilles nod. &quot;Go to him,&quot; he said. 

So Hephaestion walked over to his lover. As the kings second in command and long time friend, not much could be said if the two men had a private word. Or if he were to hug his king.

&quot;Have a good evening, Sire. I wish for you a son this night.&quot; Hephaestion ignored Roxanne.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Alexander whispered angrily? &quot;What are they doing here? They are your lovers, aren&#39;t they? Whore,&quot; he spat. &quot;Are you going to lay with them now? Hades take you Hephaestion, you will not let them touch you!&quot;

Any fight went out of Hephaestion in the wake of his lovers jealousy. It was the man&#39;s wedding day, and for him it just got better. He hugged his lover one last time, whispering into his beloveds ear. He let lips touch the lobe, his breath blow into the ear.

&quot;No Alexander. I will not let them touch me. Only you. That is a promise I made, remember? We will just talk, for they can&#39;t stay long. I will introduce you in the morning if they are still here.&quot;

Alexander felt the tug on his sleeve, and looked at the stranger he had just married. He turned back to his lover only to see him walking back to the man who had bedded him and the man who now held him. He gripped his wife&#39;s arm and led her to their marriage bed. 


&quot;So that was Alexander,&quot; Patroclus said. &quot;You know a king must marry, Kitten. It does not mean anything to the man. Even I can see that.&quot;

&quot;Gods, I forgot how you used to call me kitten.&quot;

Achilles leaned forward to whisper in Hephaestion ear. His voice had a sexy huskiness that went straight to Hephaestion&#39;s cock.

&quot;That&#39;s because you used to claw our backs like a little wild cat.&quot;

Achilles felt Hephaestion shiver, and smiled in satisfaction. He put his arm around his old lover, pulling him against his body. He reached to gather his beloved in his other arm.

&quot;Where are your rooms, Hephaestion? We will talk until it is time for us to go. We are only allowed a few hours. And we have to <em>just </em>talk. Patroclus has said we can no longer have sex.&quot; 

&quot;I have promised Alexander the same.&quot;

&quot;You, Kitten,&quot; Patroclus teased? &quot;It must be love, if you want to stay faithful.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say I was not tempted at times. But yes, dear Patroclus. He is <em>my </em>Achilles.&quot;

&quot;I am glad my sweet friend. I don&#39;t think I could have watched you go back for rebirth one more time.&quot;

&quot;Your people are watching us,&quot; said the ever vigilant warrior. &quot;Let us be private. Sex may be out, however that does not mean we can&#39;t put on a show.&quot;

Achilles grabbed Hephaestion&#39;s hair, bringing his face back to receive a bruising kiss. He then did the same to Patroclus. He laughed to himself when he felt his lover lick his lips. Patroclus wanted a taste of Hephaestion. He swept his lovers under his arms and led them to the small palace that he knew would house the king and his lover.


&quot;Did you see that,&quot; asked Ptolemy?

&quot;Of course we did. We are standing right here, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Cassander was as shocked as everybody else at what they had witnessed. &quot;I thought he had left for Gaul. Who was the other man?&quot;

&quot;How should we know,&quot; Cleitus asked? &quot;They show up today of all days. It had to be planned. Where did they come from? How did they just walk in and get by our guards?&quot;

&quot;Well one thing we do know,&quot; Craterus said, &quot;Alexander saw them before he left with his queen. I wonder if Hephaestion planned to ruin the kings wedding night.&quot;

&quot;Perdicus and I were both planning to offer Hephaestion our comfort this night,&quot; Nearchus bemoaned.

Eumenes was happy. Maybe the others would finally see what he saw in Hephaestion. An ambitious man who had used his beauty to ensnare the king, and to rise to power in the Macedonian empire. Hephaestion had been making his life miserable. Always pointing out how wrong he was. How inept Hephaestion thought he was.. Though he never used those words.

&quot;It looks as if Hephaestion will be getting comfort elsewhere,&quot; Eumenes said snidely. &quot;Or maybe I shouldn&#39;t say elsewhere. The place is the same. He is getting fucked by two men the rest of us don&#39;t know in the bed of our king.&quot;

There was no comeback.


&quot;Are you still upset, Kitten?&quot;

&quot;Not so much. Well, maybe a little. Your being here has helped.&quot;

&quot;You only hurt yourself when you are jealous. I learned that the hard way,&quot; he gave both Achilles and Hephaestion pointed looks. &quot;Enjoy being alive in this, your last life, my young friend. It goes by quick.&quot;

&quot;Speaks the man who has only lived once,&quot; teased Achilles.

&quot;Have you seen our deaths. Is this why you say this?&quot;

&quot;No, Kitten. I didn&#39;t mean it that way. We have no way of knowing these things.&quot;

&quot;It does not matter. I fear it will be soon. I sense trouble, and I fear it will be within the next few years. The empire is getting too vast, and still growing. It&#39;s getting harder to control, and our men have great ambitions. They are tired of being so far from home.They change. I&nbsp;feel it won&#39;t be long. And if I go first, I fear for Alexander.&quot;

&quot;That is a lot of fear. You can not know this, Hedran.&quot; Even as Patroclus said this, he knew that he trusted Hephaestion&#39;s feelings. This was his&nbsp;twelfth time alive.

&quot;I feel it...........You know, that&#39;s the first time I have heard my first life&#39;s name in so long, I had forgotten what it was. I prefer Hephaestion, I think.&quot;

&quot;It is the name you will be remembered for, so my Achilles tells me. You have done much in this life, my sweet one. We are very proud of you. I hope when you join us, before you start to explore, that you will spend at least a millenia next to us. I have missed you.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope we can talk Alexander into a few orgies too,&quot; Achilles winked at his lovers.

Patroclus yawned and cuddled closer to Hephaestion. It wasn&#39;t a moment later, when they realized that he was no longer awake.

&quot;He&#39;s sleeping.&quot;

&quot;The first time you come back without being reborn is very tiring. You use a lot of energy. And to pinpoint a day, at this time. Very exhausting.&quot;

&quot;You knew that Alexander was getting married? On this day?&quot;

&quot;I figured you could use a couple of friendly faces. Convenient timing, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I know. We were lucky to have each other. I&#39;m tired too. Let&#39;s have that cuddle you two girls always want. Before your Alexander arrives.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s supposed to spend the night with her.&quot;

&quot;Maybe. But, he will be here soon. It is what I would do.&quot;

Hephaestion turned to hold Patroclus, breathing in his familiar scent. He felt Achilles snuggle in close behind him. He felt the thrust of his lovers hips. Achilles couldn&#39;t help pressing his cock into Hephaestion&#39;s perky behind. They both smiled as they fell asleep.


When Alexander entered a short time later, it was how he found them. Holding each other with smiles on their faces. The fact that they were still clothed saved the life of the two other men. And his lover from a sound spanking.

He poked his sword slightly into the neck of the warrior&nbsp;who had bedded his lover.

Achilles woke instantly when he felt the point at his neck. He couldn&#39;t die. However the man holding the sword didn&#39;t know that.

&quot;Roll away from my lover.&quot;

&quot;Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion exclaimed. &quot;Oh, lower the sword, Sire. They have not touched me.&quot;

Patroclus came awake with a start.

&quot;What is going on?&quot;

&quot;It seems your kitten has a jealous protector.&quot;

&quot;Both of you, get off my bed and leave our rooms. Out of respect for Hephaestion, I don&#39;t even care where you go. Just get out!&quot;

Hephaestion stayed on the bed as he watched his two lovers get ready to take their leave. He knew that it would be the last time he would see them on this plane. And yet he knew it wasn&#39;t good-bye.

&quot;It was a pleasure to see you again, King Alexander. I know that we will be friends at another time.&quot;

The new blond stopped beside the king.

&quot;You have a treasure. He is loved by the gods, and by us. Take good care of him.&quot;

&quot;He is loved by me too. And this is something that you do not need to tell me. Please, get out of my rooms.&quot;

&quot;Until......whenever, little warrior.&quot;

&quot;When times change, kitten.&quot;

Hephaestion just smiled at them both, as they left his human life. Then he looked at his haggard lover.

&quot;You don&#39;t look so well, my love. Wasn&#39;t it as good as you anticipated it would be?&quot;

&quot;You purposely made me tired for today, Hephaestion. And you know that I am not that good without you. I&#39;ll give you all the gory details later. You leave your kings celebration to sleep with two old lovers in our bed. Of course I don&#39;t look well. I think it is time to tell me what I should know, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;You smell like <em>her</em>, I wish you would bathe first.&quot;

&quot;And you smell like </font><font size=""3""><em>them.&quot;</em>

&quot;Then let us sit in the bath together. It is full and scented. It was anticipated that you would return this eve. It is cool now, but it should be fine in this excessive heat,&quot; Hephaestion held out his hand. &quot;Come my love. And I shall tell you a tale.&quot;


Several weeks later, Hephaestion had to check way stations for trade and supplies, before they moved into India. Alexander thought a weeks camping with his lover, away from the demands of the main camp, and&nbsp;from the demands of his wife, would be quite restful. Leaving Nearchus, Perdicus, and Craterus in charge of the main army, they left for a week. Joined by several of Hephaestion&#39;s soldiers and assistants, also Ptolemy, Cassander, and Cleitus decided to get away from the decay of Bactria. All of them looked forward to leaving that place.

After appointing soldiers and runners for the supply lines, with replacement every two months, Hephaestion was satisfied that trade could come and go through Bactria. Being on the outer regions of the empire, Hephaestion doubted it would see much. There were nomadic tribes and rebels about. He had done his best in that harsh land.

On their way back to the main army, it was their last night out. Hephaestion asked the king to give him a few minutes before he followed Hephaestion to the tent that was set up in the middle of camp. A necessary must for a king.

When Alexander entered several moments later, he was met with a vision.

Hephaestion stood almost naked , save for a see through lavender cloth that wrapped around his slim hips. So short, it barely covered his rounded bottom. Alexander stared down at the twin curves as Hephaestion turned. Beautiful peaks tapering down to slim thighs. Shapely and smooth. When Hephaestion swayed toward his lover, it was then that Alexander noticed the bell bracelets adorning his wrists and ankles. Alexander had never seen a more provocative sight. Hephaestion stuck one leg out and circled his slim foot. He gave a little shake of his hips, moving his arms as he did. The jingle was soft and with the untutored movements of Hephaestion&#39;s gyrations, had a pleasing melody. Alexander could watch this every night. His lover&nbsp;looked innocently&nbsp;erotic and&nbsp;incredibly arousing. A sexual being causing tormenting desire. He was becoming unrestrained in his movements. Bending and swaying. The intensity of his movements was reaching a peak.

Alexander was bursting from just watching. He touched his hard phallus, needing to masturbate. If he even tried to penetrate his lover now, he would spend before touching him. Besides to reach orgasm, while watching his lovers undulations was the pinnacle of his sexual desire right then. And Hephaestion knew it. His alluring eyes darkened with his own need. He was always most turned on when he watched Alexander&#39;s hand touching himself. He swiveled his hips, not feeling self&nbsp;conscience anymore.&nbsp; He touched his nipples, running his hand down his own stomach to slip under the skirt to touch his own throbbing manhood.&nbsp;The bells jingled.&nbsp;He knew that Alexander loved watching him touch himself the same way that he was feeling his own body.

A shout went up through the camp.

&quot;To arms! To arms! Rebels in the camp!&quot;

Alexander and Hephaestion looked at each other alarmed. Alexander quickly tucked himself away. He threw Hephaestion&#39;s long cloak at him, gathering his own sword and shield. He looked to see that Hephaestion was properly armored before he rushed out into the night.

As a battle it had been poorly executed. The rebels thinking to catch the camp unawares.Not knowing about the battle hardened soldiers within the tents and around fires. Hephaestion had been hampered by the long cloak. Alexander seeing this had stayed by him, much to his lovers disgruntlement.

The soldiers were&nbsp; taking care of the bodies, and any mess that disrupted the camp.&nbsp;There were no prisoners. After several rebel deaths, most of them had run. There were no casualties of the kings army.

As usual, the companions gathered to make sure of each others safety.

&quot;I could have sworn I kept hearing bells,&quot; Ptolemy moaned. &quot;I thought surely that it was an omen of my death.&quot;

Cleitus and Alexander both gave Hephaestion a sharp look. The red faced Chiliarch barely moved.

&quot;There is much to be done. Quit standing around,&quot; Hephaestion ordered, trying to get the men to leave the vicinity.

Alexander was highly amused at his tortured lover. He dare not laugh for fear of never having a repeat of Hephaestion&#39;s sexy dance. He did like dancers. But now Hephaestion had ruined him for any other.

Cleitus didn&#39;t know whether to keep his mouth shut or comment that he too had heard the jingles during battle. Hephaestion could be quite unforgiving when crossed. Just ask Ptolemy. Yet this might be worth it.

There was a loud noise behind Hephaestion.&nbsp;And because&nbsp;he was facing the others, he turned quickly, causing everybody to hear the metallic ring coming from his body. Cassander who was closest, reached over, pulling up the robe that had hampered Hephaestion&#39;s fighting. He exposed one smooth golden leg. Naked except for the bells tied around his slim ankle.

&quot;Cleitus, he&#39;s wearing your bells,&quot; he cried!&quot;

Hephaestion slapped Cassander&#39;s hand, and yanked his robe down.

&quot;If any of you are thinking of talking about this, I will make your lives so miserable, that you pray for death,&quot; he threatened. Hephaestion then turned, with as much dignity that he could muster, walked to his tent in a huff. He knew his friends wouldn&#39;t heed his threat. He dreaded the companions breakfast in the morning.

Alexander watched Hephaestion flounce away, not very convincing in his lavender robe and the tinkle of the bells.He watched his lovers perky behind, the metallic ring having an effect on his manhood. He hoped he didn&#39;t grow hard at the sound of every bell he heard. Trance like he followed his sexy lover.

He turned back to Cleitus, looking the man in the eyes.

&quot;Thank you for the bells,&quot; he said throatily. His voice thick with desire for the man who had just entered their tent. &quot;I should have made him jingle long ago. I really wish you would have mentioned something.&quot;

Cleitus was indignant. Alexander knew that he had been joking for years about the bells.

Alexander could hear the laughter from his generals as he walked to his tent. He looked forward to the teasing Hephaestion would get at the breakfast table, knowing his lover could hold his own.

First he had to console his beloved, then he would ravish him. He would have Hephaestion keep the bells on while they made love, he decided, as he hurried to his tent.

The companions could hear the soft ring of bells and low moans of Hephaestion, coming from the tent of the king. For a little while their world was normal once again.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END</font></lj-cut>"

<lj-cut>
<font size=""3"">Platters of food were being set on the long tables for the elite of Alexander&#39;s army. Persian servants had&nbsp;jugs of wine that they poured in real glass goblets. It was Cleitus who raised his glass to Alexander and Hephaestion when they entered the dining hall.

&quot;Together again,&quot;&nbsp; he called. &quot; Finally things can return to normal now.&quot;

&quot;We were never apart, General Cleitus,&quot; Alexander protested.

&quot;You just took different paths for a couple days. Is that it?&quot; Cleitus laughed at his own observations.

&quot;You look well rested after your adventure, Hephaestion. Leave it to you to fall off of a cliff into the arms of some tall handsome warrior. I never have his luck.&quot; Ptolemy bemoaned mockingly.

Alexander knew that his friends were going to be merciless. They would keep provoking them until they got a reaction, hopefully his jealousy. They seemed to love his jealousy. So did Hephaestion, no matter what he said. He would allow them a little more fun, before he put a stop to&nbsp;their teasing humor. Perhaps though, all he had to do was sit back. Hephaestion had a way of protecting them both.

&quot;Well Alexander certainly has had his fun also,&quot; Craterus said quite cruelly. He had enjoyed Hephaestion&#39;s fall from favoritism. &quot;All those pleasure slaves that&nbsp;wear the kings colors. Alexander has been busy since we have arrived, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;They are just back up, General Craterus. In case I fall off more cliffs.&quot; Hephaestion was good natured in the ribbing.

&quot;Well since you are in the market for lovers now, Hephaestion.......let&#39;s not forget your friends who are willing to warm your bed.&quot; Nearchus wiggled his eye brows at Hephaestion, who just laughed.

&quot;I for one would love a chance to hear your cries first hand,&quot; Cassander winked at his blushing friend.

&quot;We all hear him first hand,&quot; Cleitus teased. &quot;Maybe that is how you can find him, Alexander. Keep him in a state of sexual bliss. Listen for his screams.&quot;

&quot;But then it wouldn&#39;t be Alexander who was with him, if it is Alexander who needs to find him,&quot; Eumenes added. &quot;Of course these days, maybe Hephaestion will lay with anybody, since he will fuck a Gaul.&quot;

&quot;Eumenes,&quot; Alexander scowled. His old friend tended to take things a bit far in his teasing.

Hephaestion knew it wasn&#39;t teasing. Although he just grinned. Eumenes always left himself open.

&quot;Anybody but you,&quot; he told the blustering red faced man. &quot;Never you.&quot; Hephaestion didn&#39;t&nbsp; like the man, much to Alexander&#39;s annoyance.

&quot;And we don&#39;t want Alexander to have to find him that way,&quot; Cassander said. &quot;Maybe we should get our king a blood hound, who only searches for the scent of Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Nearchus cried. &quot;Little chalk boards outside of every house or tent. That way Hephaestion can write down where he is off to next. Like bread crumbs.&quot;

&quot;We should just tie a bell to his clothes,&quot; Cleitus laughed. He had been trying to get Hephaestion to jingle for years. &quot;Even better, bell bracelets for his wrists and ankles like the dancers wear. I swear I am having some made for you, Hephaestion. Before we go on campaign.&quot;

Alexander leaned over to whisper in his lovers ear. &quot;That actually sounds really sexy. I would like to see you in those.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, not here!&quot; Hephaestion flushed from the look the king was giving him. Alexander laughed. It was not often he could get the best of Hephaestion with words.

Ptolemy who hadn&#39;t noticed the flushed looks and the whispering like the others, carried on with the teasing.

&quot;We want Alexander to be able to find him. We don&#39;t want him all jealous, when he thinks Hephaestion is with somebody else. You should see him, Hephaestion. He.........&quot;

Hephaestion felt Alexander tense angrily beside him. His lover had been doing well until this teasing comment.

&quot;Ptolemy, no.&quot; Cassander cried!

&quot;Shut up, you fool,&quot; Nearchus yelled!

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Cleitus sighed.

&quot;General Ptolemy, I have been thinking&lt;&quot; Hephaestion pondered dangerously. &quot;Since you are off duty for the next several days, that the medical staff may need your help cleaning wounds. Perhaps you can arrange for the entire tent and all the equipment to be washed down. I know I am right on this, and they fight me on it all the time. I will leave it to you to make them see reason.&quot;

&quot;By Zeus, Hephaestion! It is an abuse of his power, Alexander,&quot; Ptolemy moaned.

Hephaestion knew that Ptolemy liked working in the medical tent. The man should have been a doctor. He gave a little nod to his friend.

&quot;Can we <em>please </em>eat now,&quot; Alexander said, waving his hand imperiously to a servant to fill his plate. &quot;If you are all done sitting around and gossiping like women.&quot;

&quot;Women!&quot;

&quot;Alexander!&quot;

Hephaestion chuckled, reaching for the leafy vegetables. He liked the Persian dinner tables.

&quot;Eat some meat, Phai,&quot; Alexander told him. &quot;You need some protein.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure he will get plenty later, if your cries were any indication, Alexander.&quot; Ptolemy laughed, reaching for the meat platter. &quot;Sounds like Hephaestion&nbsp;will be getting plenty of meat .&quot;

&quot;Ptolemy!&quot;

&quot;Uh oh.&quot;


Alexander and Hephaestion had a rare moment together, before Hephaestion left to secure trade routes. They were on campaign, a quest to find Bessos.

&quot;Have you noticed how your boy watches us these days,&quot; Hephaestion asked. He was sitting at their shared desk, pouring over maps. &quot;I think he has learned to desire his ruler.&quot; 

Alexander had noticed that months ago. He had even asked Bagoas about it. The boy had never been given any choice in his captors of course. There fore had never been given any choice in his lovers. Now that he had gotten to know his Sire and the general, he had let it be known that his&nbsp;feelings had changed. He was now willing, if they so desired him. Alexander noticed that it was Hephaestion that he seemed most besotted with.

&quot;I have noticed. I believe he has had a change of heart. Why? Do you wish to bed the boy?&quot;

Hephaestion who was still working at his desk while talking, looked up in surprise.

&quot;I think that he is more your type then mine, my love.&quot;

&quot;I have a type?&quot;

&quot;I notice where your eyes rove. Your eyes seek out the weaker male. It is a delicate form they like.&quot;

&quot;They do not. They only look at you.&quot;

Hephaestion laughed. &quot;Seriously, Alexander, these days I am very busy. As are you. We are often away from each other. I will not mind if you decide to take the boy.&quot;

&quot;This is a change of heart.&quot;

&quot;i know you love only me, Alexander.&quot; Hephaestion had learned a few things from the memories of past lovers.

Alexander just stared. Why wouldn&#39;t Hephaestion care? It had been over two years since their indiscretions. Had the Gaul returned?&nbsp; Was there another soldier? Alexander always noticed where Hephaestion&#39;s eyes lingered also. Soldiers. Strong, scarred, battle hardened warriors. And there were thousands of them around. There were over a thousand in Hephaestion&#39;s personal command.

&quot;I need not your permission, general,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I will bed who I want. And I want no other. Do you?&quot;

Hephaestion had always been unashamed in his need. It was a challenge he was unafraid to meet.

&quot;No. Only you. You know that.&quot;

Everything was forgotten as Alexander moved to front of the chair. He cupped Hephaestion&#39;s cheeks, and lowered his head to to touch the full lips that beckoned him to kiss. Slowly he tasted. Gently at first, to savor until his need became too great. He lifted&nbsp;his lover&nbsp;to stand. Hephaestion tried hard not to break the kiss, and he moaned when the mouth left his. Alexander was leading him to the bed.

Alexander helped Hephaestion to undress, lowering him to the bed. He lay down beside his lover, half on top of him. his hands feeling the body beneath him. Hephaestion arched into the hands that ran across his stomach, up his chest to tweak his hardened nipples. He moaned under the onslaught of feeling. He forgot his work, wanton in his need. He begged Alexander to take him.

Alexander had never undressed so quickly. He gripped Hephaestion&#39;s hair, his mouth locking with his lovers in a kiss that was brutal from the passion that had been stirred within him. He pushed Hephaestion&#39;s thighs apart, his lover welcomed him,&nbsp; undulating his body and wrapping his legs behind Alexander&#39;s back. Alexander longed to be inside his lover&#39;s searing heat. He pushed one of Hephaestion&#39;s legs up, and would have ended the torture there except for the rapid knocks at the door.

&quot;General Hephaestion, the men are ready. You told me to come and get you, sir.&quot; It was Arto. Hephaestion&#39;s young shadow. The boy followed his general everywhere. Had become quite invaluable, according to Hephaestion. He also was becoming a very good soldier. Was his lover intimate with the boy, when they were away? Was that why..........?

Alexander didn&#39;t even finish his thought.

&quot;Go away,&quot; &nbsp;he growled in the&nbsp;general vicinity of the door.

&quot;General Hephaestion, are you alright?&quot; He didn&#39;t recognize the growl&nbsp;as the kings. The guards outside snickered to themselves.

&quot;Yes Arto. I will be out in ten minutes. Tell the men.&quot;&nbsp; Hephaestion looked up at his jealous lover in amusement. His incredible blue eyes blazing with lust. He lifted his hips to his lover.

Alexander leaned over to swipe his hand in the oil that was in a dish beside the bed, rubbing it onto his erection. He put his two middle fingers inside Hephaestion. Twisting them and pushing them in gently until Hephaestion&#39;s eyes glazed over and he just moaned ravenously. Alexander swiftly buried himself into Hephaestion&#39;s hot body, reaching between them to grip his lovers member, moving his hand in abrupt motions. Hephaestion reached orgasm almost immediately. Squeezing the phallus inside him and thrusting his hips up hard into Alexander.

Alexander could feel the pulsing vibrations of Hephaestion&#39;s portal, and with a moan he released his own throbbing orgasm deep&nbsp;within the body beneath him.

Falling with his full weight upon his lover, Alexander was slightly winded. He made to withdraw from his beloved. He was still being held inside Hephaestion&#39;s body. His lover sighed, savoring the feel before he withdrew. Alexander loved him most when he was like this. So beautiful in his post orgasmic bliss. He leaned down to gently kiss his beloved, when there was another knock on the door. Alexander made to stand up and yell at the boy outside, but Hephaestion held his arm.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to go, my love. this new trade route has got to be mapped out.&quot;

&quot;You are in charge of our army, Hephaestion. I would have you here. Get somebody else to do this other work.&quot;

&quot;We will talk about it when I get back, alright? Just a few days. Good health, Sire.&quot;

&quot;Be careful, Hephaestion, and be quick.&quot;

They had been away from Babylon for seven months now.&nbsp; Before that in and out of the city. They had found the body of Darius, and they had chased Bessos, the betrayer for months. Battle after deadly battle with the rebels, all the way to the north region. They were in the far reaches of the empire. One month out of Bactria. Alexander loved Babylon. Couldn&#39;t wait to go back. After his march into India, he will have taken all that he wanted.&nbsp; Only then would he return.

Hephaestion had already been gone for several days. More and more the general was leading his own men against outside factions, gaining more land for Alexander. More power. After he would rejoin the main army, he would secure trade and mail routes. Medical equipment, food, grain, fresh horses as well as soldiers, even whores he had transported in and out of their mobile city. His lines stretched all the way to Macedonia, Egypt, and most of Persia. Every little detail, he took care of. It was fine in the early years. However now, they had an empire that followed them. Hephaestion couldn&#39;t lead an army and act as secretary to the world.

Alexander was worried. There were other people who could do the job. He would hire twenty to take the place of Hephaestion. Alexander had plans for Hephaestion. He wanted him to rule his kingdom if anything were to happen to him. He was the only one who could. It had become so vast. And promised to become twice the size within years. When Alexander had a&nbsp;legal heir, he could only trust Hephaestion in the child&#39;s interest. First he would have to find a women. Before that he would have to convince his ambitious lover that this wasn&#39;t a demotion. He had promoted Eumenus the day that Hephaestion left.

Alexander leaned back in his chair, waiting for Cleitus to finish his turn at the dice game they were playing. It was evening, but the heat was still sweltering. Even though the small table they were using was set up directly beside an open tent flap, little breeze was stirring outside to make its way in.

&quot;Are we sure of Bessos&nbsp; location,&quot; Alexander whispered? Ears and mouths that could get back to Bessos could be anywhere.

&quot;As soon as Hephaestion returns we will have enough men to completely surround him.&quot;

&quot;Good, we can give him no means to escape. He will not go down easy this one.&quot;

&quot;Alexander,&quot; Cleitus spoke in a normal voice, although hesitant for fear of angering the king. &quot;Eumenes is not doing so well.&quot;

&quot;He is only a week at the job, Cleitus. Give him a chance.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should have waited for Hephaestion to train him properly.&quot;

&quot;He will be fine.&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t even listen to.........&quot; 

Alexander had risen and walked away, motioning for Bagoas to follow him into the kings tent. Fortunately for Hephaestion, Cleitus saw the servant leave several moments later.

&quot;Hades, <em>you</em> won&#39;t even listen,&quot; Cleitus sighed.

Hephaestion was tired when he rode into camp. He and Arto had ran into rebels on the way home. Fortunately this time, it was the rebels who took the worst of it. Arto had become more and more infatuated with him. In his first life he would not have thought twice about tumbling the boy. Even with Achilles and Patroclus waiting. Gods, Achilles would have joined in. They often tumbled the same boy. But now all he wanted was a bath and Alexander. He was hardly ever with his lover these days, and he ached for him.

No less then five people rushed his horse when they rode into sight.

&quot;Hephaestion,&quot; Cassander bellowed. &quot;You have to tell Eumenes to open the mail lines. My men are ready to revolt. He has closed all routes.&quot;

&quot;General,&quot; Hospha, the horse wrangler cried. &quot;We have no hay, and Eumenes has moved my horses off needed grass, so that he could camp on it. You know how much land we need for them. And what about the oxen that pull the carts? We take care of them also. We have little grain now, and we are away from the spring. How are we supposed to carry enough water in this heat for&nbsp;two thousand horses?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion,&quot; Ptolemy said, putting his hand on Hephaestion&#39;s leg. &quot;He has stopped medical supplies, because of the mail and trade routes.&quot;

Even Cleitus had a gripe. He had tried to tell Alexander, but that man had been extremely busy himself.

&quot;Hephaestion, he says that we have to go to him, when we have need&nbsp;to go to the whores. Not that I have to,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Darlas and Vonna stay with me now.&quot; Hephaestion smiled at that. &quot;But my men are spitting mad. That old pervert wants&nbsp;the soldiers&nbsp;to book through him. He takes part of&nbsp;their money. Only half the men are going to them.. And the boys and women of the&nbsp;prostitutute camp have no money for food. He even expects the whores to give it to him for free! They follow the army faithfully, Hephaestion.&quot;

Hephaestion looked at Arto, who looked as confused as he felt. He wasn&#39;t going to let this bunch see that he was out of the planning. Alexander had taken things out of his hands. For the worse of his army.

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to him. Give me a few minutes to eat, and I&#39;ll see what he is doing. I&#39;ll get the mail and supplies up again. Tell the prostitutes to come to me if there is a problem with him. He is to let them alone. Hospha, hay will be arriving tomorrow and for several days after. Grain and hay will always be a first priority. That&#39;s tomorrow. Give the grain to the oxen and the pigs and chickens and get those horses back to the grass and the spring. I don&#39;t care if you have to trample his tents. That is a main priority. I will go there first. And then I have to see Alexander.&quot;


&#39;If you would have just let me train somebody,&quot; Hephaestion said, still angry.&nbsp;&quot;Somebody I can work with. I hate him, Ale.&quot;

They had been arguing for an hour. Alexander did not know that his clerk had been doing such a poor job.

&quot;It is not your job. Your job is to rule my army. Let somebody else carry that burden, Hephaestion. You have assumed duties that shouldn&#39;t be yours. You are stretched to thin, my love.&quot;

&quot;Yet everybody comes to me with their problems. What am I to do? Ignore them, as your man does? Now I must do his job, because he can&#39;t do it without training, and he resents me for that. I&#39;d &nbsp;better go.&quot;

&quot;You just got here. Can&#39;t this wait till morning?&quot;

&quot;What are you going to tell your people when they come to you for their mail? For medicine and food? He hasn&#39;t even brought in food for the horses! Do they eat dirt now?&quot;

&quot;All right then, teach him. I will tell him to listen. In the morning. Please Phai come to bed.&quot;

&quot;Things have got to be done tonight. The king may have food in the morning, but the horses won&#39;t if they are not moved. And others won&#39;t in the next few mornings if this is not dealt with. I bet that old fool lays asleep in his bed, with no worries. By the gods,&quot; Hephaestion cried in painful frustration!

&quot;Will you come to bed later, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;No, call your eunuch, Sire. If I sleep at all it will be at my desk in the secretaries tent. If I am to help Eumenes learn, then tell him he answers to me. Give me back my authority, Alexander.&quot;

Alexander watched Hephaestion leave. No kiss or even a good-bye. He had made the right decision the wrong way, and at the wrong time. His lover was livid. After all these years, Alexander was scared again. He was afraid that Hephaestion didn&#39;t love him quite as much.

Hephaestion stopped outside the tent. The empire had grown so large, and Alexander was only trying to help. Hephaestion was so used to doing everything himself, that he had taken his frustrations out on Alexander. The king didn&#39;t wan&#39;t his empire to suffer. And he had seen reason.&nbsp;Hephaestion had given his beloved his permission to bed the boy, but did he want to push them into each others arms? He turned around to re-enter the tent. Alexander was still standing where he had left him.

Hephaestion held out his hand.

&quot;This has got to be done tonight, Ale. Come with me. We can work together. I missed you too much to be apart.&quot;

Alexander practically leaped forward to gather Hephaestion in his arms. &quot;I look forward to seeing you straighten this mess out, beloved. We will wake Eumenes first. He will have to have his pages move those tents. The horses need to eat.&quot; Alexander was happy with energy. &quot;Come on,&nbsp;my love. There is work to be done.&quot; Alexander turned to walk out the door.

Hephaestion smiled, he liked following his king. He could check out his bottom in that new robe he was wearing. Maybe they would make it back to their bed after all.</font></lj-cut>"

<lj-cut>
<font size=""3"">Hephaestion leaned back against the chest behind him. Strong arms held him close. Alexander nuzzled his lips against his lovers neck. They had been in the bath for an hour, just kissing and holding each other. Touching skin that had been apart for too long.

&quot;It is so good to have you back in my arms,&quot; Alexander whispered, his lips touching Hephaestion&#39;s ear.

Hephaestion felt a whimper rise in his throat.

Alexander glided his hand across wet skin, feeling the hard muscle of his lovers stomach. He felt the soft tremble under his fingers. He lifted Hephaestion&#39;s chin and turned his face to be able to touch the moist lips in a passionate kiss, mingling their two tastes together. Only when Hephaestion gave a low moan of desire, did he relent the assalt of the kiss. But his lips stayed busy. He&nbsp;nibbled the lobe of Hephaestion&#39;s ear, licked the beaded water from his jawline, sucked hard on the side of Hephaestion&#39;s neck, until he heard a cry of sexual distress.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Alexander spoke softly. &quot;You are mine. I will mark you as mine from now on, so that nobody dares ever again to touch what is Alexander&#39;s.&quot;

He then leaned down to gently suck on Hephaestion&#39;s collar bone, until his lover was crying with frustration.

&quot;What? What do you want?&quot; Alexander again rubbed his hand over his lovers torso, going lower to brush it along the length of Hephaestion&#39;s manhood, causing his friend to snarl his savagery. His passion for his king weakening his resolve. Alexander was showing a dominance that Hephaestion was loath to admit that he liked. Alexander was establishing ownership over his lover. Hephaestion nearly wept. His need to be possessed shaking him to his core.

&quot;What do you want, my love?&quot; Alexander&#39;s voice was like gravel. The sound making Hephaestion&#39;s cock leap.

&quot;You. I want you.&quot;

Alexander hugged his lover gently, the long chestnut hair &nbsp;caressing his face. Alexander deeply inhaled his lover&#39;s fresh clean scent. He stood up, hauling Hephaestion with him. They stepped from the tub, water running down lean bodies. Swallowing hard, Alexander moved to dry his lover&#39;s body, before his own. Only then, leading him to the bed.

Hephaestion watched Alexander tower over him as he lay back against the head board and pillows. He felt sweat bead his forehead, when Alexander cupped his erect flesh. His blond lover leaned down and sucked one hard nipple into his mouth, plying it with his tongue.

Alexander then licked Hephaestion&#39;s cock, getting it wet and hard as steel. He crawled forward to straddle Hephaestion, throwing one leg on the other side of his lover. He lowered himself onto the large organ, throwing his head back at the sheer size and heat that had impaled him.

Hephaestion surged up, wrapping one arm around Alexander&#39;s waist, the other he reached around to grab his lover&#39;s ass. Bringing it even tighter against his own body. They rocked together. He licked up Alexander&#39;s neck, tasting the flesh that his&nbsp;mouth had&nbsp;craved. Sucking on the tender skin, marking the king, much like he had been marked. Their lips met in a blazing kiss until they both gasped for air.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Alexander cried, enjoying the seldom felt ecstasy of having his lover&#39;s cock inside him.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Hephaestion moaned back. He brought his hand to the their front to stroke Alexander&#39;s cock against his own stomach. They came together in one long rush of desire, crying out each others names.

They lay side by side, staring at each others beauty, playing with hair, stroking each others face, until afternoon drowsiness claimed them, and they fell into a restful sleep.

Hephaestion awoke, startled from a dream. Alexander lay beside him, a smile on his face. The breeze from the balcony doors, caressed his naked skin. He thought of the dream that had awakened him. A dream of real life. He remembered. He had been the lover of Achilles. And Gods! Patroclus also. He remembered that he had lived other lives also, but remembered nothing about them. For which he was glad. He may go crazy if he remembered everything. He just remembered his first life. He remembered the love they had felt for each other. He knew he wasn&#39;t the main focus of their relationship, but he had loved them too much to break free. They had wanted him with them. There had been much love between them. It just hadn&#39;t been enough after Patroclus died. His lover had turned to Antilochus, ignoring Hedran&#39;s own pain. He had to watch, unable to help, as guilt and pain lead to Achilles own destruction. Hephaestion even remembered bits and pieces of the Elysian Fields, of being with his lovers. He wished he could remember more of that place, but maybe he wasn&#39;t meant to. Always he had been driven to find his missing half. His soul mate, yet to be born. He remembered the fear of being afraid he would miss him.

Hephaestion wasn&#39;t scared of this new discovery. It was the missing part of himself, that this life was but an extension of. He smiled when he thought of Achilles visiting him, claiming him again. The sneak! He couldn&#39;t think of him as Ansell now. He wished he could have seen Patroclus. He knew that the older man would be worried about him when Achilles told him about Alexander. He knew that they would see each other again. He and Alexander would be their friends in afterlife. Hadn&#39;t Achilles mentioned something like that when he was here?

Hephaestion wouldn&#39;t tell his volatile lover his revelations. Alexander would be convinced that they meant to have him back in the Elysian Fields. They had enough problems for now. There wasn&#39;t anything that Hephaestion wouldn&#39;t do for Alexander. He had been through too much in a thousand years to lose him now. Forgiving him was easy. Alexander&#39;s mistakes were not half as bad as Achilles had been. And hadn&#39;t Patroclus always forgiven him? Sure of his reward in the end?

Hephaestion felt Alexander stirring, and he cuddled back into the kings arms. Alexander had begged him not to work today, giving up his own kingly duties for a day, He wanted to stay in bed with his lover, so that just once he could wake holding his beloved. Of course that happened all the time, but Hephaestion liked when his lover needed him.

Hephaestion felt Alexander&#39;s hand roaming over his flanks. Cupping his cheeks, and running his fingers between the cleft. He couldn&#39;t help the moan of desire that slipped from his lips. Achilles and Patroclus could bring out passion, but only Alexander could ignite smouldering fires, and make him lose complete control. It didn&#39;t matter how Alexander took him. Hephaestion riding him, on his back with his legs in the air, being taken from behind,on his stomach or on his hands and knees. Hephaestion just reveled in the feeling of being possessed by his king. Of being taken by him. Of driving Alexander crazy in his own need to take his lover.

Alexander rolled Hephaestion under him, and entered him slowly. Inch by delicious inch Pulling back, until just his thick head was inside his lover, and then pushing back in. Each thrust, gaining another inch. He did this until Hephaestion was a writhing mass of need. His lover was begging incoherently, incredibly beautiful in his desire. Hephaestion was tight. So wonderfully tight, Alexander couldn&#39;t get enough of the feeling of being engulfed in the tight flames of his lover&#39;s body.

Alexander gripped&nbsp;one slim ankle, holding the leg up and out, so that he could watch his cock bury itself in&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s moist heat. He reached down with his other hand to feel the stretched hole that was gripping his cock so firmly. He slipped the tip of his finger in beside his manhood. Feeling his phallus and the slick walls of Hephaestion&#39;s opening. He pulled his finger out and grabbed the other leg. He couldn&#39;t hold off any longer. He aimed his body to hit Hephaestion&#39;s pleasure gland with every firm, smooth stroke. Hephaestion&#39;s saphire eyes shot open, holding Alexander&#39;s gaze. The king leaned forward to kiss the red lips that were swollen from passion. After one hard thrust, Hephaestion came, screaming his release into Alexander&#39;s mouth, so that his lover could swallow his cries. Alexander spilled deep within Hephaestion&#39;s body, after feeling his lovers shuddering orgasm. Their bodies hummed. They held each others trembling forms, whispering words of love.

Alexander leaned up to clean Hephaestion off with a towel. He would call Bagoas for another bath and to have him change the bedding while they dined with the other companions. He would put off all royal duties until tomorrow. He wanted Macedonia around him tonight. Let his friends see the sated look on his lovers face. Alexander had taken back what belonged to him. He was satisfied.

&quot;You look like the cat that got the cream,&quot; Hephaestion said, snuggling into Alexander&#39;s arms.

&quot;I did. Many times. Thank you, by the way,&quot; Alexander smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind Hephaestion&#39;s ear.

&quot;it was my great pleasure, &nbsp;believe me.&quot;

&quot;I was better then him, wasn&#39;t I?&quot;

Hephaestion&#39;s eyes narrowed.

&quot;He was very good, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but only I can drive you that crazy. I am much better for you than anybody else. Admit it.&quot;

&quot;All right! Yes, you are better! Gods, that self righteous tone. You are insufferable! Arrogant! Why did I have to fall in love with a king? You think..........&quot;

Alexander leaned down to steal Hephaestion&#39;s breath.

&quot;Shut up, and kiss me,&quot; he whispered, lapping at his generals lips.

Hephaestion moaned. Mmm, that&#39;s why.</font></lj-cut>"

<font size=""3"">Patroclus looked up from the stream he was sitting by, to watch his lover materialize.

&quot;You found me,&quot; he said by way of greeting, lifting his face to be kissed.

&quot;You moved us again, I see. Took me a minute to find you. How come every time I visit the mortals, you move us?&quot;

&quot;Not mortals. Mortal. Hedran.&quot;

&quot;He is called Hephaestion in this life. I think it will be the name he will be remembered by. This is the life he will be remembered for.&quot;

&quot;Achilles, you seem different. You have gone to see him in every life. You have never told me his name before. Has he.......Did he........find his soul mate?&quot;

&quot;He thinks so. I am not sure. He knew me Patroclus. He let me..... He wouldn&#39;t let me....do that, if he loved this mortal. Would he?&quot;

&quot;You love me, and never seem to have a problem with others,&quot; Patroclus said kindly. Jealousy&nbsp;had passed over a thousand years ago.

&quot;Patroclus, be fair. There has only been Hedran other then you&nbsp;for a millennia now. And I wanted you to be with us,&quot; Achilles whispered deeply.

Patroclus blushed. A thousand years together, and Achilles still made him uneasy talking about sex.

&quot;Achilles, did you really fuck him? He let you? He doesn&#39;t always let you when you meet him.&quot;

&quot;He had come from battle. You know how he used to get around me after battle.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you two were like animals.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, my love. He looks the same. So beautiful, he takes your breath. And he is an enigma. He runs an army. He is very powerful, and yet, still so gentle. He is much more submissive in this life, and very comfortable&nbsp;with it. It was very desirable, his surrender.&nbsp;I think I fell in love with him all over again.&quot;

&quot;Achilles, tell me of his lover. Is he really the one? After all this time? He has gone back to live and die eleven times. Tell me.&quot;

&quot;Patroclus, how much do you listen to the talk here? The talk about the mortals. You know.....from the new comers.&quot;

&quot;I listen sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Have you heard talk about a great king?&quot;

Patroclus had a moment of perplexity, before enlightenment.

&quot;A king?.........NO!&nbsp;By the Gods, Achilles! Not....? Is he in love with Alexander?&quot;

&quot;You <em>have</em><strong> </strong>heard of him?&quot;

&quot;How can you not? He is all the recently dead talk about. Achilles, does this king......does Alexander love our Hedran?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, now.&quot; Achilles reminded gently. &quot;And yes. He makes mistakes in love. Not as bad as I did. But yes, Alexander is the other half of Hephaestion&#39;s soul.&quot;

Patroclus was quiet, contemplating this wonderful news. Their lover, the sweet little fighter that Achilles had brought home for them both to love, had finally found love of his own. So long, he had lived and suffered and died, to be reborn to look again. Between his lives, Achilles would beg him to stay, but he always went back. To search for Alexander!

&quot;I want to see this king. This man that holds the heart of our Hedran. Achilles, I want to go to the mortal plane.&quot;

Patroclus looked to his beloved, and saw that he was lost in his memories. He sat back and waited to be noticed again.

Approx. 1195bc

The summer was sweltering. Achilles could smell the trodden earth. The battle long over, but still fresh in his mind. He could still hear the screams of the soldiers. The clang of the swords. It was if it was still going on. His blood was rushing, pumping through his veins. Adrenaline coursing through his body. He made his way to the stream, through the grove of trees, a mile upstream from the battle sight. He stopped and stared at the vision, cleansing himself, standing naked in the stream. A water nymph. Sent by Poseidon. The boy was young, but old enough to have seen battle. Twenty, maybe. Achilles&#39;s eyes roved over the slim build. A smooth, almost&nbsp;hairless chest could be seen. A strong back and legs, both leading to a round high bottom, that made Achilles&#39;s mouth water. He would have this boy. Patroclus never expected him to be faithful after battle. He was always full of to much heat, alive with energy. It had nothing to do with their love. This was about sex and release. Achilles&#39;s breath caught when the boy looked up through long lashes. This boy wasn&#39;t a gift from Poseidon, he was Circe, sent to tempt him. And by the Gods, he was tempted. An incomparable beauty. Achilles&#39;s desire flared to rapturous heights. His breath labored and thick with passion, and he had yet to touch the boy. He looked around the area, judging it to be safe from others that still may be about. He took off his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the rocks. His stare meeting the star like eyes of the young soldier. Creating a bond that restrained them together. He walked into the water to stand before his nymph.

&quot;Say yes, or say no, but say it now,&quot; he told the beauty savagely.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the boy spoke in a soft hushed tone.
 
The warrior tasted the lips.Not softly. He devoured them. A thirsty man, hot from battle. The soldier provided the only nectar that could quench&nbsp;his insatiable thirst. He picked the boy up in his powerful arms, carrying him to a grassy spot, under a willow. He ran his hands over the sinuous body, mapping the muscles and the texture of the silky skin. He wanted to taste the boy all over, needed to run his tongue over sensitive skin, but his body was singing with a greater need. The boy&#39;s feverish eyes told him that he felt the same way. He flipped the boy onto his stomach, lifting his hips in order to meet his own seeking erection. He watched as he sunk two saliva laden fingers into the boys hot wet behind, the water still dripping off of him. He loved the boys keening cries. He pulled out his fingers and pressed his aching phallus to the hole, pushing in with one long stoke. The boy was very tight, but, he took it and pressed back for more. Getting up onto his hands and knees for better leverage to push back onto the impaled cock.

Achilles own lover always needed adjustment time, but this boy required an effort from Achilles just to match his demanding cries. They came together with much force, Achilles holding the smaller man to him. Not ready to let go of the after battle treat he had gifted himself.

He finally separated to fall on the grass beside the young beauty. He wanted more. He leaned over the boy, laying half on him, kissing his lips and neck. The long haired soldier wrapped his strong young arms around Achilles neck, arching his body into the older man. He had recovered effortlessly and was demanding more. No words were spoken. They had a craving for each others bodies that&nbsp; they were frenzied to satisfy.

&quot;I am Achilles,&quot; the warrior spoke against the smooth&nbsp;moist neck.

&quot;I know who Achilles is. I know who your lover is. Isn&#39;t he going to be angry that you lay here with me?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mistake this for anything then what it is, boy. Men like us, we have a lust after battle that he has never understood. You sate that need.&quot;

The boy laughed. The sound vibrating through Achilles&#39;s body. The blue eyes danced with passion. His voice rich and melodious, the sound going straight to Achilles&#39;s cock.

&quot;Then sate your lust on me, Achilles. Have your fill of me. Let us see if your stamina can match my own.&quot;

&quot;What is your name?&quot;

&quot;I am Hedran.&quot;

Achilles pressed himself against Hedrans supple young flesh. Their hot slick bodies melding together.

This wasn&#39;t about love. It was raw. This was about need. Hot and sweaty. Hard and demanding. It didn&#39;t matter who was taking who. This was a battle for supremacy.

Patroclus didn&#39;t like rough sex. He liked to be petted and loved with long meaningful looks during gentle, tender lovemaking. It was very seldom that he had a need to be taken hard.

Not like this boy. Achilles thrust into the tight channel. Open and slick from their previous encounter. He threw Hedran&#39;s legs over his shoulders. Roughly rubbing his hands down the muscled thighs.

&quot;Keep them there,&quot; he moaned throatily. He bent the boy in two, with his slim legs over his back, he leaned down to lick the sweat from the sweet smelling boy. Kissing and sucking, he pumped hard into the body under him. Hedran was exquisite in his glory. Crying out his own need. Screaming for more of what Achilles could give him. He wanted it deeper, faster. Achilles had met his sexual match. They exploded into each other from the shattering orgasm, intense and perfect.

Hedran lowered his legs, wrapping his arms around the warriors back, he pressed his face into the sweaty neck. Achilles leaned back, gasping for air. Still holding the slim trembling body to his own. And he knew. He just knew, that this was more then raw sexual need. This<em> was </em>about love. He loved Patroclus with his very life. But his heart had expanded to include Hedran. He wasn&#39;t about to let him go.

The new lovers lay naked on the bank. Achilles studied the sleeping form. He knew that he wanted to take Hedran home with him. He couldn&#39;t believe what&nbsp;he was contemplating. He had hurt Patroclus so many times with his affairs. Troilus, who was so beautiful, that Achilles had to have him. Later executed at the temple of Apollo. Briseis, who had tried to capture his heart. Neither matched the feelings that he had for Hedran. In just a few hours the boy had lodged in his heart. Achilles felt for Hedran, the same way he felt for Patroclus. They were so different, and he wanted them both. More then that, he wanted the two of them to love each other as well.


&quot;I can&#39;t believe you have brought him into our home. I have accepted your men after battle. The women you take when the whim hits you. Always, our home has been our own. Is it because I am older? You tire of me?&quot;

&quot;Never! Patroclus, you are my air, my life&#39;s blood. I need Hedran also. He is like no other. Please Patroclus, just talk to him. Be with him. I know you will love him also.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t look as if either of us will have him. He&#39;s leaving.&quot; Patroclus nodded his head towards the grape fields, that Hedran was now passing. From behind, he indeed piqued Patroclus&#39;s interest.

&quot;By the Gods, save me from jealous men!&quot;&nbsp; Achilles ran after Hedran. Patroclus watched from the garden. This boy may bring fire into Achilles&#39;s life. Patroclus knew his lover wanted the boy. He also knew that he would always be Achilles&#39;s soul mate. His lover was the type of man to want more. He would welcome Hedran into their home. Another soldier for him to worry about. And watch over. And love.

The three of them had a wonderful few years together, Patroclus thought, lost in his own memories. He remembered he and Hedran having incredible sex. Hedran letting Patroclus inside him, when Achilles never did. He let Hedran though. The young soldier was masterful. He and Patroclus often ganging up on Achilles for hours of fun. Hedran had taught Patroclus to not be afraid of his passion, much to Achilles&#39;s delight.

Hedran had brought laughter and fun into their home. Warring and fighting with Achilles, during times of conflict.&nbsp;Gardening and cooking with Patroclus, when he was home. The boy was loved, and he loved them in return. Always though, it was Achilles and Patroclus. And when Patroclus died, even Hedran couldn&#39;t keep Achilles from his deep pain. Achilles turned to Antilochus, who was later killed by Memnon. Patroclus knew that Hedran&#39;s heart had been broken. When Achilles died and found peace with Patroclus again, they both waited for Hedran. When the chestnut haired beauty died in battle several years later, both Achilles and Patroclus were on the other side to welcome him home to their side once again. However, given the chance of rebirth, Hedran took it. Again and again, he lived and died. After two horrible lives and dreadful deaths, both Achilles and Patroclus begged him to stay. Stubborn in afterlife as he was in life, Hedran returned as mortal, searching for the soul that he claimed was waiting for him. Until now. Even here where kings and conquerors didn&#39;t matter,&nbsp;Patroclus had heard of Alexander the Great.

&quot;I want to meet him,&quot; Patroclus said once again, bringing his lovers attention back to him. &quot;I want to meet the man that Hedran is to spend eternity with.&quot;

&quot;It is Hephaestion now, my love. Two, maybe three years will have passed on the mortal plane, since I was there. And you have never wanted to go down. Not once since your first death.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care. I need to see Hedran. Hephaestion. Will the Gods let us, since you just came back?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we provide them with entertainment. I think Alexander and Hephaestion are also a source of their amusement.&quot;

&quot;Then arrange it. I need to see if Hephaestion is happy. I want to see for myself. A king! He hates kings.&quot;

&quot;This king is not like any king I have ever met, Patroclus. By Gods, this is going to be fun!&quot;</font>

"event","<font size=""3"">TIMES CHANGE<br />part six.<br /><br /></font><div class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"">Hephaestion looked beyond Alexander to the men behind him. Cleitus and Cassander were both there. Along with twenty soldiers. All of them watching Ansell and himself. The soldiers looked embarrassed. Both companions looked dismayed and a little surprised. The haughty look on the kings face did not bode well for Hephaestion. His eyes met the amused eyes of Ansell, who had yet to separate their bodies. Hephaestion unwrapped his legs from around the waist of the taller man. Ansell's softened member slipped free from Hephaestion's body. With a splash, Hephaestion fell into the water. He washed the semen from his body, glancing at his beloved. Alexander was starring daggers at Ansell. And Ansell was taking delight in the kings jealousy.. The two lovers waded naked to the shore. Ansell, without acknowledging the rank of the king, went past to gather their clothes, handing Hephaestion his. <br /><br />Alexander studied Hephaestion while he dressed. There were bruises from his battle and his fall. Others that Alexander did not want to think about. But he looked beautiful. His long hair was in wild disarray around his face. His incredible eyes were sparkling with life. His lips were red and swollen from passion. Passion Hephaestion had only ever experienced in his bed. His lover had betrayed him. Similar to the hurt child he felt like, he struck out. <br /><br />""I see the death of your unit hasn't affected you, Commander."" Alexander's next words were quiet, for Hephaestion's ears only. Yet they were nearly spit at him. ""You look like a whore!"" <br /><br />Alexander roughly grabbed Hephaestion's arm, pulling him towards the path. Ansell noticing the dread on Hephaestion's face, reached out to pull his lover free from the king's grasp. Alexander did not let go of Hephaestion's arm, while Ansell took hold off the other. Both of them were pulling on their lover, who&nbsp;tried to pull&nbsp;free from both of their holds. <br /><br />His chest was heaving, and his eyes blazing. Now the two were fighting over him? Hephaestion remembered walking in on the king being serviced two mornings before. He and Ansell shared their bodies. He owed him nothing. A life dept was not asked for. <br /><br />Alexander knew his lover well, and let go of his arm. Before he walked away, he drew himself up. <br /><br />""You would do well to hold your temper, and remember who is still your king, General Amnitor. Your horse awaits atop of the hill. There is another for the man who jumped off a cliff to save my....."" Alexander looked at Hephaestion, and with the dignity of a king in front of his people, said.....""my second in command."" <br /><br />""Thank you, King Alexander of Macedonia. I accept your horse."" <br /><br />""You are from Gaul. Are you a spy for Rome?"" Alexander had learned the Roman region of Gaul's language along with Hephaestion. He asked his question in Macedonian, since the tall man had seemed to understand him before. <br /><br />""No. I followed your army from Egypt. I am no friend of Rome's."" Ansell answered the king in Gaul. <br /><br />Alexander's eyes narrowed. The man had understood him, yet answered in his own tongue. <br /><br />""You know my language. For the courtesy of my people,if you have the intelligence to answer in Macedonian, then do so. Why have you followed my people? Have you joined my army? Are you a traveler expecting my men to keep you safe?"" <br /><br />""i have no need for a kings army to keep me safe,"" Ansell sneered. ""I saw Hephaestion building your city in Alexandria. The city that you named for yourself. It is he that I follow.""<br /><br />""You mean him harm?"" Alexander was incensed by this man. Hatred rose in his stomach. <br /><br />""I mean to have him."" <br /><br />Alexander saw the advent looks of his men, awaiting the kings anger. They would not see it this day. Hephaestion had shown Alexander what was in his heart. He had made no move to stand beside his king. He looked to his beloved, let Hephaestion see his pain. Looked pointedly at Hephaestion's hand, that was still being held by the Gauls. In front of his men, he let his lover go. <br /><br />""By the looks of my general, you already have....had him. But by all means..... ..have him again. ""<br /><br />Alexander looked at Cleitus, Cassander, and lastly, Hephaestion. <br /><br />""Commander's we have an empire to keep safe. Now that we have found General Amnitor to be quite well without our assistance, can we please leave this place?"" <br /><br />Alexander turned and started back along the river. Towards the path that would lead them to the top of the ridge. He didn't know how he was going to walk out. How he was going to ride to Babylon. How he was going to live. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cleitus and Cassander follow him. Saw Hephaestion pull out of his lovers grasp and hurry to catch up to his king. <br /><br />Hephaestion was angry and scared at the same time. He could help run an army, feed a nation, and get them through desert and wilderness. But, he was a boy in the face of his beloveds anger. Hephaestion knew that no matter what Alexander had done to him, his lovers pride would stop him from ever coming to Hephaestion. It would be up to him to bridge the gap. He was angry at Alexander for making him out to be the one that was wrong. For putting him in the position that he felt he was the betrayer of their love. And yet the truth was, that Hephaestion felt that he had betrayed Alexander. By enjoying his time with Ansell. <br /><br />When he hurried to catch up to his king, Alexander hurried his pace to follow his soldiers. Hephaestion realized that Alexander didn't want to talk to him now. He knew Alexander well enough to know that his lover was barely holding on. He fell into step beside Cleitus. He didn't need to look back to see if Ansell followed. He could feel him behind them. He didn't feel like it would be right to walk with the warrior either. <br /><br />""Looks like you had a good night, after all the mayhem was over,"" Cleitus remarked. ""You had to know that we would find you, Hephaestion."" <br /><br />""I did. I just wanted..."" <br /><br />""Yes, my friend, we saw who you wanted. Can't blame you there. However, since you knew that Alexander would find you in the morning, did you also want him to see you in the arms of another?"" <br /><br />""Cleitus, that's not the way of it. You sound like an old women."" <br /><br />""Maybe I do. Yesterday we had to tell my king of his lover's loss. The loss of his best friend and general. It wasn't until he got to the sight that he heard of your cliff adventure. Your assistant is still alive to tell the tale."" <br /><br />""Thank Zeus."" <br /><br />""He told about your fall into the gorge, and the handsome stranger jumping in after you. He told Alexander that he thought the man must be a god. It was dark. We couldn't see to find you, and we didn't know how many Persian rebels were about. I watched Alexander grow up, Hephaestion. Last night I had to keep soldiers away from him to help him save face. Then I had to hear his muffled tears. His fear for you made him cry in his sleep. What little he got. He spent the night making deals with Zeus, which I hope&nbsp;are never answered. It is not something I wish to go through again. We all face perils every day. And you and Alexander have stood in line of danger. I did not like hearing my kings cries in the silent night."" <br /><br />When the procession entered Babylon, Hephaestion, after handing his horse to a groom, turned to face Ansell. They were heard to be talking in a strange language. Alexander, hearing the mangled greek that he knew, turned from his lovers secretiveness. <br /><br />""Where will you go,"" Hephaestion asked. ""How long are you staying?"" <br /><br />""Hephaestion, a smart man told me years ago, that when you love, when you really love, there is no room for anybody else. Do you want me to stay because you love me, or because you crave Alexander's jealousy?"" <br /><br />Hephaestion drew back, indignant of the accusation. <br /><br />""The night we shared was wonderful, not so wonderful that I am willing to lose Alexander. I didn't ask you to stay. I expressed an interest."" <br /><br />Ansell smiled down upon the beautiful man. So young, and so strong. Holding in his fears and running an empire. This Alexander had better realize the treasure he had, or Ansell would make his afterlife a misery. Ansell wanted nothing more then to gather Hephaestion to him. Keep him safe. Take him home, so that he and his Patroclus could guard his happiness. It wasn't to be. And truthfully, Ansell loved the younger man enough to want his destiny to be with Alexander. He was the soulmate that Hephaestion had searched a&nbsp;millenia &nbsp;for. <br /><br />""I know that you didn't ask. I wish I could stay with you, just to keep you from harm. You have faced more dangers then I during life."" <br /><br />""You can stay,"" Hephaestion whispered. Not really wanting to part with this man he felt such a deep bond with. ""You can join my unit. I could use you. You can probably have your own unit. We...we can be friends."" <br /><br />""I can't stay here, Hephaestion. I only have a short amount of time I can be here. My own Patroclus awaits."" <br /><br />""You keep saying that. Yet, you wanted me to be with you. What would this other Patroclus think if we were together?"" <br /><br />""He is not the other Patroclus. He is just Patroclus. You are Hephaestion. And he would have welcomed you and loved you. We both would. But, you have found your soulmate, my love. We are happy for you. Now, find your mate, and sooth his soul. He will be a hard one to love. You had to love a king, didn't you?"" <br /><br />Hephaestion asked the question that he had been afraid to ask. He thought he knew the answer. Maybe he was crazy for thinking it. <br /><br />""Ansell. This bond we have. I know you, don't I? From......from before?"" <br /><br />""We know each other well, little one."" <br /><br />Hephaestion blushed. Only Ansell would dare call him little one. It felt like an endearment coming from those lips that had given him such pleasure. <br /><br />""Will I ever remember?"" <br /><br />""Perhaps. If you can open your mind."" <br /><br />""I am a little scared of all this."" <br /><br />""You, Hephaestion?"" <br /><br />Ansell cupped the beloved face in both his large hands. Hephaestion let him, leaning into the safety of the touch. He didn't care that Persia judged him. He didn't care that his whole army watched him, that the other generals moved in around him. Not really trusting this stranger with their fellow companion. He didn't even care that he could feel Alexander's eyes on him. He faltered a moment, while thinking of Alexander. Wondered if he was in his rooms alone, or if the eunuch was with him. His thoughts came back to the man that he had to say good-bye to. Someone he felt was a part of his life, <br /><br />""Even now, you think of him. My little warrior, there is nothing to fear. You have fought in all the battles. Conquered all the worlds. Reborn and faced death many times. All in the name of love. I bow to your bravery, for there are none who are your match."" <br /><br />""There is one,"" Hephaestion whispered, suddenly longing for Alexander. His heart ached for his love. <br /><br />Ansell stepped back, resigned to the hopelessness of ever having Hephaestion's complete love. <br /><br />""Go to him. I have seen his soul. There is only room for you."" <br /><br />""He is so stubborn. I fear my hardest battle."" <br /><br />""The one worth winning. You had to chose a king didn't you?"" Ansell leaned forward to kiss the full lips once more. savoring the taste, and the feel. The very essence of the man he loved. He gave a little grin and walked away. <br /><br />Hephaestion watched him turn a corner, motioning to Cleitus not to follow. He didn't think it possible for any of them to follow anyway. <br /><br />Hephaestion cleared his eyes and saw the people around him, meeting their eyes. He straightened his back and squared his shoulders. It wa time to face the fury that was Alexander. <br /><br /><br />Alexander stormed to his room. Once inside he was undecided as to what to do. He felt his anger subside. Beside the fear of losing his lover to death, there had been an overwhelming anxiety of losing his lover to an unknown force. Another man. It had required great mental and physical effort to endure the pain of seeing Hephaestion in the warriors arms. Knowing that their bodies were linked. He wondered if that was how Hephaestion had felt, knowing that Alexander had been with another. Alexander hadn't reached the heights that Hephaestion had. He had seen his lover's face. The&nbsp;rapturous feeling of intense orgasm. The joy of being taken. Feelings that he should have only felt in Alexander's arms. <br /><br />The weakness that had invaded his soul had now reached his knees. The strain becoming to much, he went out on the balcony, to lean against the railing. He watched Hephaestion and Ansell talking quietly in their secret language that sounded much like the native tongue of his lover. <br /><br />Alexander was unaware that tears fell from his eyes. The blurriness was just another part of his troubled heart. He knew that he was witnessing a farewell. It helped knowing that his lover would no longer be seeing the man that had tried to steal him from the king. Yet, did it really help? The whole army was now aware that Hephaestion had taken another man. He would be open game for any would be lover. Hephaestion knew that Alexander had been unfaithful Had even asked for Hephaestion's understanding of his deeds. How could he ever hope to keep Hephaestion to himself. <br /><br />He had never really wanted anybody other then Hephaestion. He was always hearing people talk. His own people thought that it was Hephaestion who ruled the army, Hephaestion, who controlled the king. He wanted to show his people, and even his beloved that he was his own man. That he was king, and lived by his own rules. Now he wished he had talked to his lover about it. Just now remembering how Hephaestion had to endure vicious untrue words about his own rise in the army of the king. <br /><br />Hephaestion was so sexual. So giving and loving. Alexander thought that it was with only him that Hephaestion was like that. Now he wondered if Hephaestion was like that with anyone he shared his body with. Had there been others? With Ansell gone, would Hephaestion be like that with anyone he was attracted to? Had Alexander driven Hephaestion to seek the warmth of other men? If that were the case, then what made Alexander special? <br /><br /><br />Hephaestion stopped outside Alexander's door. Not long ago, he would never hesitate to enter what would also be his room. He had told his lover that he wouldn't enter uninvited again. Said in anger, and even a little spite. Yet, now he was afraid to enter. Had it come to this? He asked the guard, who he knew well, to inform Alexander of his presence. <br /><br />Alexander was on the balcony when Hephaestion entered. Just a few days had passed since first seeing the glitter of Babylon. Since first walking into these rooms. Days that had changed their relationship. Days that had brought them each pain and jealousy. Both feared being displaced by a rival. <br /><br />Alexander could feel the close proximity of his lover. <br /><br />""I don't know what to say to you anymore. What do you want, Hephaestion?"" <br /><br />""I want what we lost, Alexander,"" Hephaestion answered,&nbsp;eying the eunuch that had just entered the rooms. <br /><br />Alexander turned to see what had drawn Hephaestion's attention. A little surprised and angry when he saw Bagoas enter with fresh wine. He had noticed the fleeting look of anguish on his loves face. <br /><br />""Leave the wine. You are not needed."" <br /><br />""Yes, master. I am sorry for the interruption. I thought General Hephaestion might feel thirsty or have a need for food after his ordeal."" <br /><br />""I am hungry, Alexander."" <br /><br />""Fruits and nuts, Bagoas. Maybe a little of the chefs sweet bread."" <br /><br />""Yes, Sire. I am happy for your return, General Hephaestion."" <br /><br />""And why would that be?"" <br /><br />""Because the king was praying for your safe return."" <br /><br />""That's enough, Bagoas. Send a servant up with our food. No, bring it yourself. Prepare it yourself."" <br /><br />""Yes, sire."" <br /><br />""Precaution's Alexander?"" <br /><br />""I have to take them. After your attack, I don't know who I can trust."" <br /><br />""Do you want to talk about security?"" <br /><br />""Yes, but not now."" <br /><br />""You trust the boy?"" <br /><br />""He is just a few years younger then us. And yes I trust him."" <br /><br />Hephaestion felt the pierce to his heart. It seemed that they would draw blood upon each other. <br /><br />""He does seem to be ensconced in your rooms. Permanent fixture? Found you you didn't like sleeping alone? Or just didn't want to sleep with me any longer?"" <br /><br />Alexander heard the bitterness in Hephaestion's voice. A sharpness that he seldom heard in his gentle, yet powerful companion. His lover had claws when riled. Hephaestion's resentment gave hope to Alexander. <br /><br />""I only had him the first night. He didn't sleep in my bed. I wanted you. I sent for you."" <br /><br />""Yes, and I came. Thank you for that show. I guess you had him the next day also."" <br /><br />""I sent for you earlier. I was bathing. He touched me. I am only human, Hephaestion."" <br /><br />""What did you want me for?"" <br /><br />""I wanted to tell you that I didn't want anybody else. That I was sorry."" <br /><br />""You didn't fuck him the next night?"" <br /><br />""No, and I slept alone. I am sorry I wasn't able to talk to you at the celebration, my love. Those boys in my colors. They are unwilling harem boys. it is just to keep them safe."" <br /><br />""I thought..."" <br /><br />""I know. Why wouldn't you think that?"" <br /><br />""And Bagoas didn't touch you the next morning?"" <br /><br />Hephaestion saw the telltale flicker in Alexander's eyes. <br /><br />""No, he didn't."" Alexander knew that his lover suspected a lie. It would be&nbsp;detrimental to tell the truth, no matter how painful to them both.&nbsp;"" He brought somebody else with him."" <br /><br />""And he touched you?"" <br /><br />""I fucked him. It was worse then with Bagoas....... Oh Hephaestion I am so sorry. I won't try it again. Only you, my love.""<br /><br />""Do you know what I think? I think that if it had been good for you, you would continue doing it. I think that because you saw me with somebody else, that is the main reason for your change of heart. You cant stand that I enjoyed passion with another man."" <br /><br />Alexander stalked to Hephaestion. He grabbed his arms and gave him a shake. <br /><br />""NO! By the gods, no. I can't stand it. You're right. I hate you for your betrayal. I wished I didn't love you so much. Wished I didn't need you. I do though. It kills me, Hephaestion. Why?! Why did you let him fuck you?"" <br /><br />""I wanted him."" <br /><br />""Would you have lay with him if I hadn't made these mistakes?"" <br /><br />""I would have wanted him. But no. I wouldn't have let him touch me."" <br /><br />Alexander fell heavily on the bed. His anger just a disguise for his pain. He put his head in his hands. Suddenly tired. He didn't know what to do. For the first time in his life, he was at a loss. He felt his chest heave. Felt the sobs break free. <br /><br />""I can't do this without you, Hephaestion. I know you will do your duties. But I need you beside me. It's so hard all this. We are building the greatest empire in history. You are my only shelter from all the hardship."" <br /><br />Hephaestion slipped his arms around his king. Pressing Alexander's face into his chest. leaning down and kissing the top of his head. Inhaling his scent. This was his lover. His soulmate. He could feel Alexander's sobs as he wept. He dropped to his knee's and wrapped his arms around his beloveds waist. He lie his head down into his loves lap. <br /><br />""You are Alexander,"" he whispered. and&nbsp;I belong to you. Only you."" <br /><br />Alexander knew that they had to talk. Talk about what they had both done. About their future. He wanted his lover back in their rooms. He wanted his fun loving general back. But right now, all he wanted to do was hold the man he loved. Together they lay on the bed, To share for the first time. <br /><br />""I hope he hurries with our food. I might fall asleep. And I have so much to do today."" <br /><br />""I want to know where you're going, Hephaestion. I never know where you are."" <br /><br />""Oh Ale, not this again."" <br /></font></div>"

Part five </font>

<lj-cut><font size=""3"">The water carried Hephaestion several miles downstream, before he hit a rock and lodged there. It seemed like moments later when he awoke enough to detect hands pulling him from the rivers grasp. He moaned when his thigh felt the jagged edge of another rock. When he felt strong arms lift him up and cradle him, he lay his head upon the strong shoulder. He heard the man give a soft chuckle before he succumbed to sleep.

Hepheastion moaned and touched his head. The bump had gone down and he felt better. Glancing at the sun he judged it to be an hour before dusk. He had always loved the twilight hours.

He lay back down trying to remember how he got there. He remembered the ambush, and seeing his men go down one by one. His eyes shot open as he remembered the man who had helped him. Where was he? Who was he? Hephaestion could swear he knew him. But how could he? Hephaestion decided he didn&#39;t know the man. Maybe he had seen him before though. He turned his head and saw the stranger bent over a low fire. He had two fish skewered on a stick. Hephaestion&#39;s mouth watered. He hadn&#39;t eaten his lunch. The last food he had, was with Vonna and her mother the night before.

The man rose from the fire, and Hephaestion got a good look at him. He was naked! Clothes were spread over the rocks. Hephaestion noticed for the first time that he too had no clothes on. He had obviously been cleansed of the mud from the rivers bank. Hephaestion felt his body grow warm from the thought of this mans hands on his bare skin, while he lay sleeping. Did his hands linger? Needing to touch him?

&quot;You&#39;re awake?&quot; 

The language of Gaul. Hephaestion had learned it, but lack of use made him rusty.

&quot;Thank you for pulling&nbsp; the rain off me,&quot; Hephaestion said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanking the man for saving his life.

The man chuckled at the beautiful Greek&#39;s attempt. &quot;I am Ansell,&quot; he said in the Greeks own&nbsp;language. 

A language that Hephaestion seldom used. He always had to speak the Macedonian tongue. He had missed his own more flowing, and articulate language.

&quot;I am Hephaestion. You have saved my life. How did you get down from the cliff so quickly? I saw no paths.&quot;

&quot;You are too beautiful not to save. I jumped of course.&quot;

&quot;You jumped?! &nbsp;You jumped in the water? From the cliffs edge?&quot; Hephaestion was astounded. Why would a man jump off a cliff to save a stranger? Ansell was looking at him intently. It had been awhile since he had felt such concentrated attention.

&quot;I have fish. I didn&#39;t want to leave you to hunt for anything bigger. There is a goat path a half mile back. We will be able to walk out tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Why not tonight?&quot;

&quot;It is almost dark, we don&#39;t know who is up there. Maybe someone might look for you tomorrow.&quot;

It would be soon that Alexander would learn of his lovers disappearance. Alexander would come for him. If he wasn&#39;t to busy with his eunuchs, Hephaestion thought bitterly.

&quot;And look, fresh water.&quot;

Ansell was pointing to a stream of fresh water coming down from the top of the ridge.

Ansell handed Hephaestion one of the fish. He had wrapped them in leaves. Hephaestion was unfamiliar with the leaves, but they added a nice spicy taste to the fish. They picked at the meat with their fingers, and washed with sand and water at the stream of cool water coming down over the rocks. While Ansell was busy, Hephaestion rinsed his body and mouth. Glancing down he spied mint leaves growing in a cluster by his feet. He picked a few to chew on.

Ansell had gone to check on their clothing, giving Hephaestion a moment to study the man from Gaul. He was what Hephaestion imagined Achilles would look like. He couldn&#39;t help compare the man to his own Achilles. Both were blond and beautiful. Powerful men. This man was tall. The muscles on his legs and buttocks when he bent over, made Hephaestion moan. He wanted to feel the hardness of this man&#39;s body that was covered by golden skin. When he turned around, all Hephaestion could think about was running his hands over the strong chest. He wanted the stranger. Alexander had no room in his thoughts, and that scared him a little. Before he remembered that he was no longer in Alexander&#39;s.

Ansell walked over to Hephaestion. He felt the younger mans desire. Craved the passion he saw in Hephaestion&#39;s eyes. He had watched Hephaestion and the king since Egypt, where he was traveling. Followed the army and blended in. Waiting for the opportunity to see the blue eyed man. He had followed the unit earlier in the morning. He could always remain undetected if he wished. When he saw them under attack, he was afraid he wouldn&#39;t get to Hephaestion on time. He found his soon to be lover battling bravely. He was going to jump after Hephaestion immediately, as soon as he saw the slim man knocked off the cliff. But he knew that the Persians would find out that they hadn&#39;t killed the young boy. Hephaestion would want the boy to live. He stayed to kill the remaining rebels, hoping there were no more. He had taken a leap of faith from the cliff. Scared for a moment when he felt winds carry him backwards. When he landed in the water feet first, he thanked any and all Gods for the rivers depth. Hephaestion must have landed in the deep pool also, before&nbsp;being taken down the rapids. He had to swim downstream as well as letting the river propel him. He was five minutes behind Hephaestion. He finally found the chestnut haired beauty lodged against a rock, his face thankfully out of the water. Hephaestion had snuggled into his arms, sensing a haven. A home to where he could lay his head.

His blue eyes met the blue eyes of Hephaestion. The exquisite face of the one he desired. He had longed for the younger man for what seemed like an eternity. He spread his long cloak on the ground, beckoning for Hephaestion to join him atop of it.

&quot;Come. You don&#39;t ever have to fear me.&quot; Ansell noticed the confusion mar Hephaestion&#39;s beautiful face. &quot;What is wrong?&quot;

&quot;The tongue you spoke. It is not Gaul. I understand it, though I have never heard it. It is ancient Greek.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Ansell again spoke the Greek that Hephaestion was used to. &quot;It is the tongue we were taught when I was first learning Greek.&quot;

&quot;But it hasn&#39;t been spoken thus for hundreds of&nbsp; years.&quot;

&quot;Things move that slowly where I am from.&quot;

Hephaestion saw Ansell&#39;s hand reach for his face, and he leaned into it. The name Ansell didn&#39;t fit this tall warrior either. It was the last coherent thought Hephaestion had for some time. The heat from the hand burned his cheek, causing his body to flush. He wet his suddenly dry lips, seeing Ansell&#39;s eyes fix on his tongue. Hephaestion was mesmerized by the strangers eyes. Eyes that devoured him. He gave himself up to being consumed by the man.

&quot;I want you,&quot; Ansell whispered in a rich throaty voice. The sound making Hephaestion shiver.

&quot;I&#39;ve never been with anybody other then Alexander.&quot; Though he was nervous, Hephaestion wanted this.

&quot;Give yourself to me. Say it. Tell me take you.&quot; Again the ancient language was spoken. Again Hephaestion understood it.

&quot;Yes, hurry. By Zeus, hurry!&quot; Hephaestion urged in the same tongue.

Ansell gripped Hephaestion&#39;s shoulders and pulled his lover into his strong arms. He lowered his head to Hephaestion&#39;s and tasted the parted lips, moaning at the taste. His lover had found the mint leaves that Ansell himself had found earlier. But it was the taste of Hephaestion that drove him crazy. He kissed along the smooth jaw and down his neck, loving the throaty moans of passion that Hephaestion elicited. Ansell lay Hephaestion down and licked the rosy nipples. He suckled until the sensation drove Hephaestion to arch his back and seek contact with his groin. He kissed Hephaestion down his hard stomach, swirling his tongue around the navel. Hephaestion cried out his desire, no longer able to control his need. Ansell had heard the rumors of the kings and Hephaestion&#39;s loud cries in bed. He meant to make this man forget he even had another lover. He also heard tell of the king taking the harem boys to his bed. How any man could prefer the pampered pets belonging to the old king over this wild beauty was beyond Ansell. Hephaestion was a warrior, yet he lay in his arms begging to be taken, giving his body more eagerly then any harem boy alive. Ansell always did think that kings could be stupid.

Hephaestion felt his cock engulfed in searing heat. Felt Ansell&#39;s tongue explore the ridges. Hephaestion tried to keep himself from coming. He was so hard, all he wanted to do was thrust up into the mouth. Alexander would suck him, but seldom to completion. The king always preferred to be inside him when he came.

&quot;Come in my mouth,&quot; Ansell whispered, looking up at Hephaestion with shining eyes. &quot;I want to taste you. I need to have you fill my mouth.&quot;

The words alone almost made Hephaestion come, and he felt the mouth on him in earnest now. He reached down and felt the silky tresses. Years of training kept him from plunging his cock up into the throat. But Ansell urged him on. He took all of Hephaestion&#39;s length swiftly up and down until Hephaestion couldn&#39;t take anymore and released himself into the devouring mouth. He felt moistness on his legs. Tears came to his eyes when he realized that Ansell had come from just sucking his cock.

Ansell crawled back up the beautiful body to kiss his lips again. He felt Hephaestion draw back, not used to tasting his own seed. However when their lips touched, Hephaestion eagerly welcomed the taste.

Ansell grinned, eyes dancing.

&quot;You taste good, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Hephaestion blushed, not wanting to say yes to such a question. Ansell just chuckled.

&quot;Tell me about your lover. How come you are out fighting Persians when you should be keeping his bed warm?&quot;

Hephaestion drew back, insulted. Only to feel the mans superior strength pull him back into his arms. Hephaestion struggled a little, but soon gave up. After all, he was used to arrogant men.

&quot;I do my duty. I do the duty of many men. Alexander will name me Chiliarch. And I will earn it on my merit. Not on my back!&quot;

Ansell held his firebrand close. &quot;I know how hard you work,&quot; he said in the language of Gaul. Hoping that Hephaestion would follow this tongue as well as the others.

Hephaestion hesitated in answering in the foreign tongue. But he had always wanted to master many languages. Soon he found he knew more then he had thought. Ansell went from speaking Gaul to modern and ancient greek. Hephaestion followed him word for word.

&quot;How do you know how hard I work?&quot;

&quot;I have followed your army. It&#39;s interesting watching your empire. Does Alexander know what he has in you?&quot;

&quot;Most people know my worth,&quot; Hephaestion said, avoiding the question.

&quot;I am sure he knows that you are the only one that can help run his vast empire. How is he going to feel about losing you as a lover?&quot;

&quot;I will always be his lover,&quot; Hephaestion answered.

&quot;You and many others, I have heard. And no. No you won&#39;t. I don&#39;t like to share my lovers.&quot;

&quot;You will have to. He is my Achilles.&quot;

&quot;What if the real Achilles claims you?&quot;

&quot;I am not his to claim.&quot;

&quot;Does he call you his Patroclus?&quot;

&quot;Yes. This is private.&quot;

&quot;Maybe. But the story of Achilles and Patroclus isn&#39;t. And you are no Patroclus.&quot;

Hephaestion was hurt. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Patroclus is a wonderful man.&quot;

&quot;Is?&quot;

&quot;Was. But he was no warrior. He much preferred to stay at home. He would cook and do laundry. Much like a wife. A beautiful man for Achilles to come home to.&quot;

&quot;What about Briseis?&quot;

&quot;An arrogant mistake. Much like Alexander is doing now with his harem.&nbsp;The spoils of&nbsp;war.&quot;

&quot;Do you think it hurt Patroclus?&quot;

&quot;I know it did. Very much.&quot;

&quot;Then we are alike. I have that much in common with the lover of Achilles.&quot;

&quot;Achilles had another lover, you know. A lover that was welcomed by Patroclus.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;He...I can&#39;t remember his name.&quot;

&quot;This can&#39;t be true. Achilles and Patroclus loved each other. It is a great love story.&quot;

&quot;Yes that is true. Never the less, Achilles loved another. Patroclus loved him also. Because Achilles did.&quot;

&quot;What happened to him?&quot;

&quot;Ah, Homer never wrote about him. After Patroclus died, this man, who was a warrior much like Achilles, hid in the gift horse along with his lover. Achilles didn&#39;t die in the arms of Briseis. He died in the arms of his other lover. A lover who always thought he was un-needed in Achilles life.&quot;

&quot;Maybe he was.&quot;

&quot;No, Hephaestion, he was needed very much. When he died, he chose to be reborn.
He insisted he had his own soul mate out there. Achilles told him to look, but he was coming after his lover if he took too long. And that he would be watching out for him.&quot;

&quot;I think who ever weaves the tales in Gaul, should better know our Greek heroes. Zeus knows what will be said about Alexander and I.&quot;

&quot;They will say you were great lovers. And some will say that Hephaestion once loved another. And that he loved you. Now, come here.&quot;

Hephaestion again let himself be pulled into the Gaul&#39;s arms. He wanted more. His body ached for more.

&quot;Do you want me inside you?&quot; Ansell pulled Hephaestion&#39;s hand down till it was touching his cock. &quot;Feel me. Feel how big I am for you.&quot;

Hephaestion did feel him. He ran his hand back up over Ansell&#39;s abs, down the thin trail of hair leading to the large cock. He gasped into Ansell&#39;s mouth when the cock twitched in his hand. It was satin over steel. A little longer then Alexander&#39;s large cock. Wider too. Hephaestion couldn&#39;t wait to feel the monster stretching him.

Ansell pushed Hephaestion over onto his stomach, kissing down his back. He kneaded the hard globes of the soldiers ass. By the moonlight, he could see the entrance to Hephaestion&#39;s body. He felt himself leak at the sight that had his mouth watering for a taste.&nbsp;He pulled the cheeks apart gently, licking up the entire cleft, just to come back to the portal and lick around it. Swirling his tongue, slathering it with moisture, before plunging his tongue in as far as it could go.

His face was buried in the cheeks, inhaling and tasting his lover. He couldn&#39;t get enough. Hephaestion&#39;s own loud moans were arousing him to new heights. He licked two of his own fingers, bringing them up to push into his lover. He sat up and watched a writhing Hephaestion pushing himself back onto the probing digits. He loved the feel of the tight hole grasping him, but now he wanted it to be his cock. He pulled Hephaestion&#39;s hips up, and with his knees he pushed the legs apart until he lay with his bottom wagging in the air and his legs spread wide. Hephaestion&#39;s shoulders lay on the cloak, his face a picture of need. Ansell almost came from the provocative sight. He pushed into his lover with one long stroke until he was buried in the tight hole.

Hephaestion cried out from the fullness. He didn&#39;t know if he could take it. He pushed back into the body, feeling the mans balls slapping his ass. He pulled away and pushed back again, gasping when the large head grazed his pleasure spot. He could hardly tighten his hole to grip the man as Alexander liked. it was so big and felt so good. Almost as good as Alexander. Hands gripped his hips, and Ansell started to fuck him with long deep thrusts. Penetrating so slow and steady, Hephaestion thought he may die from the exquisite torture. He cried out in protest when Ansell pulled all the way out from his body. He was flipped onto his back with his legs on the Gaul&#39;s shoulders. He was filled so quickly that he screamed. Ansel leaned down to kiss his vocal lover. They were alone in a hostile land after all. He fucked Hephaestion hard. The boy pushing back against him, begging for more.

Hephaestion reached down between his legs to feel the hard cock entering his body. His fingers touching his own stretched entrance, feeling the shaft bury itself inside him. He pulled his hand back up to stroke his own leaking member. He felt Ansell&#39;s hand wrap around his own. It was to much, and without warning he came violently. His body tightening around Ansell, squeezing him. He bucked his hips up to take one last thrust. His legs fell from the shoulders to wrap around Ansell&#39;s waist. He could feel the warriors powerful orgasm. Proud that he had made the older man cry out his own joy. He loved the wet heat he could feel deep inside his body.

Ansell wished to the heavens that he could see his writhing lover in the now pitch black sky. He could hardly remember a orgasm rocking his soul as this one had. Not even with his own Patroclus. He let his body fall gently onto the slim&nbsp;man below him. He loved how Hephaestion didn&#39;t push Ansell&#39;s larger frame off of him. He just wrapped his arms around the Gaul and held on tight. Their sweaty bodies cooled in the night air. When Ansell felt their matching heartbeats slow down, he rolled off, pulling Hephaestion with him. He brought his lovers head to lay on his shoulder, noticing Hephaestion&#39;s breathing had slowed down. His lover was already asleep. Kissing the top of his lover&#39;s head, he&nbsp;wiped them both off, using a corner of his cloak, before gathering the man into his arms to hold him through the night.

Ansell knew that he would have to leave soon. He wanted to take Hephaestion with him. He also knew that death was the only way to separate Hephaestion from Alexander, and even then temporarily. Hephaestion had found his soulmate. Ansell would be happy with this one last night with the incredible man. And if it could make Hephaestion&#39;s dense lover see what he could be losing, then all the better. Ansell closed his eyes. He would not sleep. He would hold his lover and guard his safety until the king could find them. They could walk out. But Ansell knew that the king would walk down, upon finding the path.

It was sometime later that Ansell felt Hephaestion grinding himself into his leg. Hephaestion was obviously a man with great sexual desires.

&quot;Can I fuck you?&quot; Hephaestion was glad for the cloak of darkness. He was hesitant to ask. Most powerful men didn&#39;t feel the same way he did. Or they did, but they were loath to admit the need to have a cock in their ass.

&quot;It&#39;s been a long time for me,&quot; Ansell whispered back. 

&quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;It feels like it&#39;s been almost a thousand years.&quot;

&quot;Then I think you&#39;re due.&quot; Hephaestion lay in back of the taller man. Both of them on their sides. He slipped a trembling hand down to probe between the Gaul&#39;s cheeks. He wished there was more time, but it was nearing daylight. He needed the cloak of darkness to mask his growing attraction to his new lover. An attraction he dare not explore more then this one night for fear that the exploration would take him far from Alexander.

He felt Ansell push back onto his spit soaked fingers. He wet his phallus, wishing he had some oil to use for the older man. Yet when he pushed inside he was rewarded with an uneven breathy moan, that made his own breath quicken. He wrapped one arm under Ansell&#39;s neck to rub his chest and nipple. The other he reached around to slowly pull on Ansell&#39;s member in time with his deep thrusts. It had been so long that he had been the one to do the taking that he felt his imminent release. He quickened his hand to bring Ansell over the edge with him. Both of them eager for the sought after feeling.


The sun was up when Hephaestion again opened his eyes. Only to find Ansell kneeling down with a handful of berries.

&quot;The only breakfast I could find,&quot; he said slipping a berry between Hephaestion&#39;s lips, when the other man sat up.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you sleep?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to waste a minute,&quot; Ansell answered in ancient Greek. A familiar sound to Hephaestion after the night they had spent.

Hephaestion knew the feeling of loss. He had felt the same the last few nights before entering Babylon. Knowing that it was where he might lose his lover. He owed it to Ansell to not think of Alexander on these, their last few moments together.

&quot;I found a deep spot in the river. We had better wash.&quot;

Together they walked naked into the water. They washed the sweat and dried semen from each others bodies. They held each other and kissed.

&quot;Where will you go?&quot; Hephaestion asked in Macedonian. He had fun using the different languages throughout the night.

&quot;I have someone waiting for me. He has been patient for an overly long time.&quot;

&quot;Will I see you again?&quot;

&quot;Maybe. But if not here, then someday in the Elysian Fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;You and your Alexander, and I and my Patoclus will talk together. We will be friends. This was our night of passion, and our two loves will learn not to begrudge it to us. It may even help to win back your love,&quot; Ansell grinned.

Hephaestion felt sad though. Ansell had given him back his desire. Made him feel wanted again. He rubbed up against the warrior&nbsp;who had saved him, wanting him one last time.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you sore?&quot;

&quot;No. We came many times last night, but you were only in me once. I want you again. I need to feel you in me one more time.&quot;

Ansell had no problem being ready for the ravishing boy. Hephaestion&#39;s luminous eyes were looking up at him with a desire that he seldom saw. The sun shining on his chestnut hair, the moist pink lips. It all made for a very alluring picture.

The water was up to his waist. Higher on Hephaestion. He easily lifted the younger man in the water, slowly lowering him onto his hard aching flesh, hoping his own pre-come was enough lubricant. Hephaestion felt so tight and warm around him in contrast to the cool water. The feeling was so extraordinarily good, that he blinked back tears in the morning sun.

Hephaestion wrapped his legs around Ansell. He felt so light in the water. For a moment he leaned right back to float for a minute while his lover held him steady. The cock buried inside him, the water rushing by him. He leaned back up, feeling Ansell give short strokes. Not pulling out far. Just enough to nudge his pleasure gland, and to deeply push back in. He wrapped his arms around Ansell&#39;s neck, kissing him with great depth. Only pulling away when in need for air. His orgasm building inside him to explode when he felt Ansell&#39;s own release and loud moans. Hephaestion cried out his joy, collapsing into his lovers arms, Ansell&#39;s cock still inside him.

When Hephaestion was again able to open his eyes, it was to find himself looking at the man standing on the shore. Staring into the sad and angry eyes of Alexander.</font></lj-cut>"

"event","<font size=""3"">TIMES CHANGE<br />part four</font><br /><br /><lj-cut><font size=""3"">Alexander had Bagoas wake him early so that he could breakfast with his men. Two mornings had passed since they had entered Babylon and he had not yet seen most of them. He was told the night before of Ptolemy&#39;s sickness, so he knew about Hephaestion&#39;s taking up his post. Convenient for his reluctant lover to have an excuse not to talk. He would be sure to personally greet his lover on his return that evening. He would drag him to his room to talk if he had to. But Hephaestion&#39;s childish behavior to him stopped tonight. The generals had decided to each take twelve hour shifts. Trading nights and days as time went by. He needed Hephaestion to know that he was no longer seeking out others.<br /><br />Bagoas didn&#39;t believe that the king meant no morning pleasure. Just unconsenting morning pleasure. The eunuch was pleased that he was relieved of that duty, but he brought along another who was more then eager to pleasure the new king of Babylon. When they both entered the royal chambers, he couldn&#39;t help but notice the look of interest given to the new boy.<br /><br />&quot;My king, I brought along Theasis. He sometimes helps with the many duties of running the kings royal rooms. He has already prepared your bath Sire.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander was already heading to the bathing area. He knew what this was about. He just had to decide how faithful to Hephaestion he was prepared to be. He knew he wanted to spend the nights in his beloveds arms. He didn&#39;t want that intimacy with any other. But when Hephaestion was not available, what was wrong with his getting his needs met? He was sorry Hephaestion had to witness his indiscretion yesterday. However there&nbsp;were a lot of burdens on the king&#39;s shoulders. If he could relieve himself of some pressure when Hephaestion was not around, then why should his lover care? The impersonal experience was a good way to start the day.<br /><br />The hands that now washed him belonged to another harem beauty. He had impassive features. Any expression did not exist. It was for this reason that Alexander wanted him. He wanted no love or tenderness. He just wanted to get off. He pulled the boy into the water, clothes and all, turning him around to face the tile.<br /><br />&quot;Are you willing?&quot; he asked in the boys ear.<br /><br />&quot;Yes Sire, I am here for your use.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander pushed up the the robe the boy was wearing, exposing long thin legs and a young boys behind. He again took no time to prepare, he just pushed in. He did wait a moment giving the lad time to adjust before he continued. It was over in minuets.<br /><br />&quot;Get out! Get out, and leave me alone.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, my king. Should I return tomorrow morning?&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion would be back. Alexander had every intention of waking up with his lover in his arms. He was just as unsatisfied as he was the first time he bedded someone other then his lover. The boy&#39;s ass was thin. He knew how to grip and push back against Alexander. Not like Hephaestion&#39;s hard curved bottom. Hephaestion, who couldn&#39;t get enough of what Alexander had to give him.<br /><br />&quot;No. Bagoas will tell you if I have need of you again.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;Good morning, my friends.&quot; Alexander glanced around the room. Informing himself of the faces that were absent. &quot;Report to me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;joy to you, Alexander. What do you wish to know,&quot; Eumennes asked.<br /><br />&quot;Tell me the where abouts of my generals. Who is where? Has there been any activity?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion took my place this morning, Sire,&quot; Ptolemy said. &quot;Last night I was very sick. I do feel a little better this morning though. He relieved Nearchus who just returned. Nothing to report from him. He has gone up to his bed.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Craterus has also returned, Alexander,&quot; Eumennes continued. &quot;Cleitus has taken his place. He will be relieved this evening by Ptolemy.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And who will be relieving Hephaestion?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am, Alexander,&quot; Cassander spoke up. &quot;I will sleep for a few hours today to be vigilant in the dark.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Keep your ears open, as well as your eyes, and listen to your senses. Your horse will alert you of danger. Did Parminion and Philotius get going alright?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They left with Hephaestion with over one hundred men and rode north. They will stay out several days, to be joined and replaced by Perdicus and Craterus. Everyone on rotation, Sire.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Very good, Eumennes. I am proud of you men.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That&#39;s fine Alexander, we are all pleased by your pride in us,&quot; Cassander provoked him. &quot;There was one who left here this morning who was not feeling your warmth. We all enjoyed the pleasures your harem offered last night. It makes me wonder how wonderful the four boys who wore your personal colors must be. You have never even marked Hephaestion as your own.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I would if I could.&quot; Alexander refused to let Cassander see his irritation.<br /><br />&quot;Well, it&#39;s to late now to do that anyway. Hephaestion would never wear the colors worn by so many,&quot; Cassander mocked. &quot;I think he will soon look for somebody else to gift his body&#39;s loyalty to.&quot;<br /><br />That remark troubled the king.<br /><br />&quot;You Cassander? You would like that, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Very much. But if it didn&#39;t work out, I would know then what I am missing, and I would forever mourn his loss. Much like you will be when the glitter of your boys begin to dull.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion is the only one who shines for me. Why do you persist in annoying me, Cassander?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Enough! Cassander, for ten years I have listened to you two bicker. I grow weary of it. Quit provoking your king!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ptolemy&#39;s right. get some sleep, Cassander. I have meetings today. I will be here to dine with anybody available.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander left the room. He was vexed that Cassander had managed to irritate him. He had not been given any breakfast or even any tea. He had noticed that his men had already eaten. There should have been a servant there when the king entered. He would have to tell Bagoas to take care of that. The boy was becoming invaluable. Not a boy. He wasn&#39;t much younger then he and Hephaestion.<br /><br />It was later then Alexander had intended, by the time he again entered the dining hall. He sensed the difference immediately. Craterus, Perdicus, and Nearchus were facing Ptolemy and Cassander. Those two were dressed in full armor, ready to leave for patrol. Alexander knew that on this night it was more then that. He recognized the soldier standing with them. Tolus. Cleitus&#39;s man. For a moment Alexander wished he didn&#39;t have to hear the news he was about to hear.<br /><br />&quot;Alexander,&quot; Nearchus moaned softly. Alerting the others of his presence.<br /><br />&quot;We were just coming to find you,&quot; Cassander said quietly.<br /><br />&quot;But you needed to talk it over first how best to give me the news.&quot; Alexander turned to his oldest general. &quot;Tell me the news that everyone else seems to already know.&quot;<br /><br />Craterus looked at the boy. Reminding him of Phillip at that age.<br /><br />&quot;General Cleitus has found the horses and bodies of the unit belonging to General Hephaestion. All the bodies found appear to be dead, Sire. Cleitus sent Tolus back with the news.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander swallowed bile. His skin grew clammy and he felt cold in the evenings heat. He reached for a chair when he felt his legs begin to tremble. It was Cassander who steadied him and helped him to sit. Cassander who had tears in his own eyes, that he refused to wipe.<br /><br />Alexander looked at Tolus.<br /><br />&quot;Have you seen the body of General Hephaestion yourself?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There were ten bodies, Sire. General Hephaestion&#39;s was the only one not found, when my lord Cleitus bid me to send for you.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander rose swiftly from his chair.<br /><br />&quot;Imbeciles! Why do you scare me like that? No body means he might not be dead. Ready my horse. I ride with you. Tolus, you will lead Generals Cssander and Ptolemy and myself to the sight. I&#39;ll get my armor. Cassander we will need more men.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Already seen to, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Craterus, you, Perdicus and Nearchus will stay here. Better have your men ready to arm. We don&#39;t know how vulnerable to attack we are.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sire, are you sure you should be riding out at night?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have to.&quot; Alexander turned to go when he was stopped by Nearchus.<br /><br />&quot;Alexander, I need to go with you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The place of ambush, Sire. My men and I were all over those rocks. I&#39;m the one who told Hephaestion to stop there. I had promised him it was safe. It is my fault, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander felt numb. Maybe that news may affect later. Not now.<br /><br />&quot;Let your guilt go. We need you here.&quot; Alexander tried to smile. Tried to stay strong. &quot;Hephaestion is not dead, General. Although you may wish he was when he comes back. I expect he will give you latrine duty upon his return.&quot;<br /><br />It was almost dark by the time Alexander rode into Cleitus&#39;s makeshift camp.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m glad you are here,&quot; Cleitus said, approaching the riders. &quot;I don&#39;t have enough men to seal the area. Cassander get your men patrolling the area. Ptolemy, you had better do regular patrol. I have torches made using the clothes of the persian dead, and plain tree branches. Hephaestion carried enough oil for two nights.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander who had dismounted and was standing beside the tall general, reached for the mans arm.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus, you found Hephaestion&#39;s body then?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, not yet, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank Zeus.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;ll maybe be thanking somebody. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Zeus&#39;s doing though. Come my friend. I will show you.&quot;<br /><br />Cassander and Ptolemy started to direct their men. Ptolemy to search the perimeter and Cassander to patrol the camp and the rocks around them.<br /><br />Alexander followed Cleitus to a large clearing, torches all around, keeping it lit. Fortunately with more soldiers it made attack less imminent. Bodies were being wrapped in linens and put into&nbsp;the wagon Tolus had brought.<br /><br />&quot;The attack was here,&quot; Cleitus said pointing to another clearing a few feet away. &quot;I thought that Hephaestion would have checked the area. I was mad that he would allow an ambush. Then I learned from one of the Persian men that was still alive at the time, that there are trenches and tunnel&#39;s all over these rocks. I&#39;ve covered the openings to this area, and I have men posted. It&#39;s how bandits have operated for years in these parts.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Is the rebel still alive?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, he met with an accident. However we found one of Hephaestion&#39;s men still alive. He was the last to see Hephaestion. Wait till you hear the tale he tells.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander&#39;s eyes narrowed menacingly, angered that Cleitus would keep this news from him for even a moment.<br /><br />Cleitus welcomed the kings anger. An angry Alexander was better then a king in despair.<br /><br />&quot;I had to give him time to get stitched up, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t care if his guts are laying in the sand. Take me to him!&quot;<br /><br />The torches revealed the mayhem that had taken place. Hephaestion&#39;s men were a mix of Macedonian and Egyptian. Hephaestion being the only general to take on the training of the Egyptian to their way of fighting. This was supposed to be an easy mission. No one really expected that&nbsp;there would be an encounter this close to Babylon. If Hephaestion had brought the men he was used to. Men who were used to fighting together, would they all be dead? Alexander saw the bodies of the Persian rebels lined up on the other side of camp. Over thirty. Someone kicked a little ass, he thought proudly.<br /><br />Alexander studied the boy that Cleitus led him to. A one time page of his lovers. He had seen battle several times. Hephaestion cared for this boy, who came from&nbsp;his homeland. Athens. Greek, like Hephaestion. Alexander was relieved that he would have some good news to tell his lost lover when he found him.<br /><br />&quot;Arto, tell the king what you told me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hello, Sire.&quot; Being Hephaestion&#39;s page he had heard and seen many things. He always blushed and stammered in the kings presence. &quot;I am sorry, my king. I wish I were able to better protect General Hephaestion. I scouted the rocks myself. I didn&#39;t see anything. It is my fault, Sire.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It seems to be many person&#39;s fault, except those who did the killing. Spare me this and tell me what you saw. Hurry soldier.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We were eating, Sire. Hephaestion kept looking towards the rocks. I did too. There was nothing there. But Hephaestion made us mount up. He kept urging us. The rest of the soldiers were skeptical. But I know my master. I trust his instincts.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s probably what saved you,&quot; Cleitus mused. &quot;Continue, boy.&quot;<br /><br />Arto&#39;s voice faltered during the rest. The memory to fresh to not feel the pain<br /><br />&quot;Most of us fell in the first minutes, Sire. Hephaestion&#39;s horse moved. It saved him from a spear. He yelled for us to move. But, it was too late. They rose right out of the rocks. They were upon us like that.&quot; The boy snapped his fingers. &quot;Hephaestion fought hard. He killed at least several men, Sire,&quot; The boy said proudly of his general. &quot;I killed three myself.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You said most were killed in the first minutes. There are thirty bodies over there.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There were two other men alive for a few minutes. They killed five or six. But it was the tall one that came to help Hephaestion, that killed the rest.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Who do you mean? Who came for Hephaestion? How do you know this?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I was still fighting then, so I saw him first. Hephaestion&#39;s back was to me for a moment. There were at least five men on him. I saw this man rush by me. He was tall. Muscular. He had long blond hair flowing under his helmet. This is why I am hurt.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He ran by me, not caring whether I was tiring or not. He was intent upon Hephaestion. It was his purpose. I could see that. Feel it, even. I thought he was a god coming down to help one of their own. That thought made me hesitate. Hence the sword wound. The soldier who inflicted it, didn&#39;t know that it glanced off my armor, into my shoulder. He left me to go and help his people fight Hephaestion and the god.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why do you insist that he is a god?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I think he was. Is. You should have seen him, Sire. He fought like he was Achilles. When the last man was dead, they took off their helmets and faced each other, and....&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I....it...they both looked so beautiful. I am sorry, Sire. I know that Hephaestion is...But this man....He...Anyway, I was watching them when three more men jumped out from the rocks. One man knocked Hephaestion off the cliff. Down there,Sire.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion fell off the cliff? Where is this warrior?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That&#39;s the funny thing, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is not funny to me. Finish the story, please.&quot; Alexander was wondering if he would ever get the full tale from the impressionable boy.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m sorry....I&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Tell me the rest. Now!&quot;<br /><br />Arto hurried to get the rest out. &quot;After he killed the three men by himself, he went to the cliffs edge to look down. He looked devastated. He backed up a few steps and made to jump off the cliff. It&#39;s suicide. I called out&nbsp;for him to wait. I know he heard me, I saw him hesitate. Sire, it&#39;s over one hundred feet down. He took a running leap, and threw himself off the cliff. I crawled over to see what happened. I saw him in the water, fighting the current. It is so swift, he was already almost out of sight. I can&#39;t believe he lived through that jump. Hephaestion might have also. I saw no sign of his body on the rocks. The warrior jumped in to save Hephaestion. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus made the obviously tired boy lay down to sleep. Alexander thanked him briefly and walked to the cliffs edge, where the boy saw Hephaestion and his savior go over. He took a near by torch and threw it over the side. Intently watching it&#39;s progress. Illuminating the straight cliffs to the rocks and water below.<br /><br />&quot;I want to go down there.&quot; Alexander told Cleitus, who had come up to stand beside him.<br /><br />&quot;I know you do. But Alexander, they are both way down stream by now. It&#39;s dark and we can&#39;t see anything. I can&#39;t let you go down with rebels all around us. We can go at first light. We will ride along the cliffs edge until we see a path, or bodies. We can always send down a rope.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why would he jump off the cliff to save Hephaestion?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I would. Why would he?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t know. We can ask him, when we find them. It happened some hours ago. Maybe they are already making a camp, waiting for us.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion and this blond god, who had jumped off a cliff to save him. Alexander knew it wasn&#39;t the time for his jealousies to arise. For some unfathomable reason this man scared him.<br /><br />&quot;Try to sleep, Alexander. One of my men made you a bed by a low fire. My men are all around you. It&#39;s safe. We will find him, my friend.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Alexander lay down, facing away from the fire. He welcomed the heat, yet he didn&#39;t want Cleitus&#39;s men watching his face. He and Hephaestion have had many near death experiences in the past. Both have had to fear for the other. Before though, they always had their love to cling to, in order to get them safely home. With all that Alexander had put his lover through the last couple of days, had Hephaestion lost hope for his lover to find him? Or had he turned to the blond warrior for comfort? Another Achilles to take his Patroclus. Alexander closed his eyes, praying for his lovers safety. And praying for Morpheus to take away his fears. </font></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<font size=""3"">TIMES CHANGE <br />part three <br />. <br /></font><div class=""ljcut""><br /><font size=""3"">No warnings <br />I own no part of the characters as you well know. <br /><br />Part three <br /><br />When Alexander awoke several hours later, he knew that Hephaestion would already be up and someplace in the large city. Alexander could only hope that he might have told somebody where he might be. Cleitus's idea of a bell was sounding better and better. Alexander had wanted to make things right with his lover before the large celebration later that evening. His thoughts were disturbed by Bagoas entering his room by way of the bathroom. <br /><br />""Your bath is ready, Sire."" He spoke softly, with his eyes downcast. Even though Alexander had taken him to his bed the night before, there was no intimacy between them. After he and Hephaestion had made love for the first time all those years ago, they had been shy, a little playful, and they couldn't keep their hands off each other. Alexander realized that he hadn't really thought of the young pleasure slave as anything other then what he saw on the surface. Not a young man with feelings and dreams of his own. <br /><br />A bath did sound good, before he set off to do the hundred things he would have to see to before he could bask in his triumph. He walked naked to the bathing area, unmindful of his nudity. <br /><br />Bagoas watched the young king, noticed the scars that adorned his body. He wondered what it would be like to love this god-like man. A thankless task, he thought. For one such as he, there would always be something more around the next bend. Look how he had forgotten his love because of the allure of Babylon. <br /><br />Alexander sank into the deep warm bath, leaning his head back against the sloped marble. A comfort he wished he could share with Hephaestion. His lover could be stubborn and put up a token resistance, but Alexander wouldn't be denied for long. <br /><br />Alexander enjoyed the boys administrations. He was washed gently and impersonally from head to toe. Even his private parts were washed meticulously. He was a little surprised to feel the boys hand back on his awakening cock. He was handled expertly. When Alexander looked up at the slave, he saw that this was just as impersonal as the cleansing of his body. A daily ritual maybe. It felt good and meant nothing. Who was Alexander to refuse the catering of his body's needs. Naturally it was how Hephaestion found him. His general had started speaking from the bedroom. <br /><br />""Alexander, you summoned me? Aren't you out of the bath yet? Is Babylon making you lazy? I just thought I should tell you where I am.........."" Hephaestion stopped speaking. <br /><br />Except for the brief flash of pain in Hephaestion's amazing blue eyes, his expression was stoic. <br /><br />""I am sorry for intruding, King Alexander. It will not happen again."" Hephaestion couldn't help the small amount of bitterness to seep into his voice. The sight of seeing his lover being attended to was disconcerting. ""I see you have not yet finished your evening."" <br /><br />Bagoas never faltered. He continued as if there had been no intrusion. Alexander unfortunately was in the throes of orgasm. His eyes flew alarmingly to Hephaestion. He noted the fleeting look of pain, but was unable to stop his body's response. He heard as if from a distance Hephaestion's stilted words, as he came into Bagoas's governing hand. When he again came to his senses a moment later, the doorway was empty. <br /><br />Alexander looked at Bagoas. He couldn't understand how a boy of his young age could be so nonchalant. Alexander didn't feel any better after the hand job. His body had found it's release. He felt a fear that was unknown to him. A feeling he hardly recognized. Like most things in Alexander's life, he would bully himself through it. <br /><br />""Do you know who I am meeting today?"" <br /><br />""Abdul Mazoi is arranging your celebration. There will be the governing heads of the immediate provinces. Local dignitaries and current Persian court advisers. They have not yet been dismissed of duty, Sire. They await your command. My lord Mazoi has informed me that there will be a luncheon for you to attend to meet these people before your actual festivities tonight."" <br /><br />""How do you know of these things?"" <br /><br />""You told the steward to talk to your general Eumennes, and to inform you in the morning."" <br /><br />Alexander did remember the conversation. Already he was letting this city sway his reasoning's. He would have to be more alert. If Hephaestion had been with him as he usually was, Alexander would be his confident self. When his first general, diplomat, and friend was not by his side, Alexander found it difficult to function. It did not matter if Hephaestion wasn't actually close to him, there was a bond that linked them together. Today he felt the distance. He remembered the flash of pain he saw in Hephaestion's eyes. He realized that Hephaestion was not so understanding as he led Alexander to believe. <br /><br />""How do you know so much of the kings daily routines?"" Alexander was intrigued of the daily workings of the Persian court. He would worry about his lover later. He knew by experience that Hephaestion would be long gone into the inner mechanisms of Babylon. Alexander would use his time wisely. <br /><br />""I often helped the old king. I am more then just a pleasure slave, Sire. I can keep facts in my head, and I am trained in protocol. I stood by my old masters back and observed his needs, watched his court, and often advised."" <br /><br />""A heavy load for one so young."" <br /><br />""I am nineteen, Sire."" <br /><br />Older then Alexander had first thought. <br /><br />""How loyal are you still to King Darius?"" <br /><br />""If I say I have no loyalty to the old king, you might think I can not be trusted. Darius did not treat me well. I was loyal to him, now I am loyal to you."" <br /><br />""what did he do to you?"" <br /><br />""He would use me roughly. Sometimes he gave me to his friends, like the other slaves."" <br /><br />""So none of you have free will in your life? I do not like this."" <br /><br />""Oh no, Sire. Most of the harem are there by choice. They are taken care of and they like it here. There are many who are captured. Eunuchs, like me. Even most of them are agreeable to their life."" <br /><br />""Yet you are not. Why have you come to my bed, if you were not consenting?"" Alexander had risked his relationship for this boy. This boy had caught his eye if he were honest. He let his lust rule his head, and he ignored his heart. <br /><br />""I serve the king. It is my duty."" <br /><br />""Well, you now have a new duty. You can be my adviser in Persian protocol.You may wake me up, and ready a bath, but you will not initiate anything more. Sex is no longer a duty. You can be a free man and work for me if you prefer."" <br /><br />""My king, I never imagined......Thank you...I...."" <br /><br />""Yes, yes, I know. We don't have time for thanks. Dress me. I must see if any of my men are around before I see the Persians."" <br /><br />""Some of them are breaking their fast in the east room, Sire.......My king, won't the one who was just here be angry if I am always around you?"" <br /><br />""His name is Hephaestion, and I will explain it to him. He is smart and kind. Why are you concerned now, Bagoas?"" <br /><br />""It wasn't my place to be concerned before. But if I am to care for you, then I can tell this man is important to you."" <br /><br />""Don't worry about it, Bagoas. Hephaestion has always been amiable to whatever I say. He has always been supportive to my wishes."" <br /><br />Bagoas doubted it. He liked his new master, but the arrogance of kings never surprised him. <br /><br /><br />""What's wrong?"" Cassander noticed the closed look upon Hephaestion's face. He gave no hint of irritation. That was how Cassander knew something indeed bothered his friend. Hephaestion was usually very upbeat, and sometimes annoyingly cheerful. <br /><br />""Nothing, let's go."" <br /><br />""He was still with him, wasn't he?"" <br /><br />""By Zeus,"" Cleitus yelled. ""Do you want me to go hit him upside his stupid head? I diapered his behind. I'm not above paddling it if I have to."" <br /><br />Both Hephaestion and Cassander giggled at this thought. It helped relieve the tension. <br /><br />""If you two are coming with me, let's leave. I have a lot of ground to cover. And I don't want to talk about this."" <br /><br />Hephaestion first took them to the granaries. They both protested, but soon were very surprised at what went into the feeding of an empire. Hephaestion talked of the wealth of the last harvest, how much grains were in stock, what could be transported without hindering the people left behind. He planned supply lines to places they had not yet been. He anticipated where they might go, and how many people would follow. It was just an initial meeting, but by the time they left, he had respect from the Persians, and a better understanding from two of his men. <br /><br />They followed him to the temporary homes of their soldiers, who they found had been treated well. They had been given housing that had belonged to the fallen persian soldiers. As well as the men who had followed Darius and Bessos. Even the Egyptians who had joined their army had been treated well. The threat of Alexander's wrath had followed them from Tyre. <br /><br />The Medical staff and cooks were happily ensconced with their own kind conferring with their counterparts. <br /><br />Hours later, when they finally found where the camp followers were located, Hephaestion was livid. They had been allowed in the city. Barely. They were told to set up on the outskirts of town and threatened not to leave. They had no help with water for cooking or bathing. They didn't know where to go for food, or to take care of any wastes. Most of the whores serviced the foot soldiers. Cassander and Cleitus were hardly aware of their existence. They had women from conquered countries or their own pages to take care of their needs. <br /><br />They watched and even helped Hephaestion find the right stewards, and demand proper care for their people. He threatened with the name of Alexander. <br /><br />By days end the the three soldiers actually sat down with the whores to eat the evening meal. They were supposed to be at Alexander's banquet an hour ago, but since Hephaestion was in no hurry Ceitus and Cassander found themselves enjoying the simple repast with their fellow Macedonians. At that particular table, status and job description did not matter. Hephaestion and Cassander found themselves amused when Cleitus took a shine to Darlas, the mother of Vonna. He was appalled when he found out she was the widow of a young soldier who had died in Egypt. She had no way of supporting herself or her daughter. Cleitus was smitten and made plans to visit the two girls the next day. Vonna had slept on his lap, in his strong arms, the entire evening. Hephaestion was relieved. He worried about the mother and daughter and often helped when he could. <br /><br />It was time to leave. Past time. The kings generals walked through the city, enjoying the sights of its bizarres and the people selling their wares. Most of them were closing down for the day. But all three stopped and looked at items that were still available. All three men bought beautiful robes. Cleitus bought one for Darlas, and a little one for Vonna. Hephaestion and Cassander helped with the selection and Cleitus didn't feel foolish because of it. Hephaestion even went so far as to buy trousers and a vest that he had seen the Persian men wearing all day. He good naturedly took his friends jokes and picking about his choices all the way back to the palace. <br /><br /><br />The large banquet room was filled to capacity. People roamed the hallways and the four balcony's that were outside the open glass doors. Braziers were used on the balconies, and hundreds of candles and oil lamps adorned tables, safely set inside large pots. Sconces were all over the walls and all four sides of every pole in the large room and hallways. Slaves refilled them constantly. Also the food and wine, which there was an abundance of. <br /><br />Alexander proudly watched his men mingle with the Persians. Macedon could stand with pride among their new people. He had been busy the moment he had left his room that morning. There was no end to Persian dignitaries. He had put off any decision for power change. Although he had assigned his own people to oversee certain aspects of the court. Such as the treasury. Alexander had found that men did foolish things in adverse times. He had also learned the his extensive harem were part of the all night entertainment. Bagoas had informed him that two other eunuchs, one slave, and two harem girls hated the tradition of being the personal entertainment of the men's desires. He sent the girls back to the harem. The others he deemed unavailable by simply dressing them in his royal colors that marked them as the kings private property. <br /><br />BY the time Cleitus and Cassander showed up without Hephaestion, Alexander was very angry at their lateness. Alexander knew the necessity of establishing control over the defeated city, but Hephaestion knew the importance of this dinner. He felt sure his lover had prolonged his duties. Alexander realized that a simple sorry might not appease his stubborn lover. Summoning Hephaestion and having him walk in at the inopportune moment of seeing Alexander in the midst of orgasm had made his lover beyond angry. <br /><br />When Alexander had listened to Cassander exuberantly telling him of their day, Alexander felt envious. Not of a jealous sexual nature. But just the camaraderie of his friends. Once upon a time before the sometimes&nbsp;monotonous duties of his kingdom took over his life, Alexander would sometimes accompany Hephaestion on his duties. Tasks, not necessarily his, but taken over when&nbsp;there was&nbsp;no one else able to do the job. At least one good thing had come of all this. Two of his battle hardened generals had a new respect for just a small part of Hephaestion's daily routine. <br /><br /><br />When his lover finally arrived, bathed, shaven, and his long hair braided, Alexander felt a release of tension. Until he saw what Hephaestion was wearing. Alexander himself had decided to wear Persian robes to honor his new people. He was glad when Cleitus and Cassander had shown up wearing the lovely garments also. He was not prepared for the vision of his lover, who had gone all Persian and wore white diaphanous pants and a jeweled vest. The vest showed his smooth, almost hairless chest. It ended an inch above the pants, showing a hint of Hephaestion's skin when he moved. It was the trousers that held Alexander's attention. They were almost the same as every Persian in the room. except Hephaestion's were a little thinner material. On Hephaestion the look was devastating. Pure seduction. Alexander could see the outline of his lovers ample cock, and when he turned around the king could see the shadowed cleft of Hephaestion's small muscled bottom. Alexander was almost salivating. <br /><br />Hephaestion made his way over to his lover. He would take this step, like every other. Plus he had missed Alexander desperately. He was hoping to lay with his lover that night, but he had just learned of Ptolemy's food sickness. Hephaestion had volunteered to take his place for perimeter patrol. There were larger troop units searching for Darius, however Alexander wanted the safety of patrols around the city. <br /><br />""Joy to you, Alexander,"" Hephaestion said. He bowed low and kissed Alexander's ring. A sign of respect and subservience that Alexander felt uncomfortable receiving from Hephaestion. <br /><br />""I trust last night went well?"" There was no sign of mockery. Just one friend discussing the sexual night of another friend. <br /><br />Alexander knew better. <br /><br /><br />""No, my beloved. It was not as I envisioned. Hephaestion, I....."" <br /><br />Bagoas had come up behind the king whispering about a honored guest that had to take his leave. Alexander had not yet met him. <br /><br />Hephaestion noticed the intimacy of his lover and the man that now shared his bed. His eyes widened when he recognized the clothes the eunuch was wearing. Glancing around the room he saw three other boys in the same dress. The kings colors that marked them as personal royal property. <br /><br />When Alexander again turned back to his lover, he was met with raging blue eyes. <br /><br />""I see you have made a new life for yourself, Alexander."" <br /><br />Alexander looked at his lover in confusion, and was dismayed when he saw Hephaestion look to the boys wearing the kings colors. <br /><br />""No! Hephaestion, it's not what you think. I only...."" <br /><br />Hephaestion was spared listening to his lovers excuses, by the arrival of Persian hierarchy. With another bow to a stuttering Alexander he left his side, toured the room and left the banquet hall. <br /><br />Hephaestion, for a second night did not want to sleep alone in his room. Eunuchs! How many did he need? How would Hephaestion compete with that? For the first time in his life, Hephaestion's confidence was shaken. <br /><br />He changed out of his Persian clothes and again donned his Macedonian. He carried his armor, and made his way to his soldiers housing, where he would spend the night. He and ten of his men would switch shifts with Nearchus for patrol at first light. <br /><br /><br />Hephaestion and his men had stopped for lunch at a shady patch of trees and rocks that Nearchus had deemed safe. It was a quiet afternoon, yet Hephaestion sensed a danger that he could not yet see. He urged his men to mount up. He glanced up at the rocks that could be used for an ambush, and he felt nervous. The horses gave the first sign of distress for which Hephaestion felt grateful. He was prepared for the attack. He counted at least twenty-five men. In just a few minutes he saw&nbsp;eight of his men fall. He was taking out the attackers, but not fast enough. There was just Hephaestion and&nbsp;two other soldiers left against five men, and Hephaestion saw one of his soldiers go down. <br /><br />From out of no where a tall warrior had joined the fight with Hephaestion. He took on three of the remaining five. Together they made quick work of the job. Hephaestion watched the soldier battle his last man. He had never been turned on by battle as some men were. However, watching this tall muscular warrior was causing him to feel a lust he had only ever felt with Alexander. <br /><br />When the two faced each other, they both took off their helmets and stared at the others beauty. The man stole Hephaestion's breath. Hephaestion didn't know if his heart would stop or just pound out of his chest. They took a step towards each other, when three more men jumped down from the rocks. One of them knocked Hephaestion off the high cliff and into the raging river below. When he surfaced a short ways down before going under again and swallowing the murky water, he saw the tall beauty battling all three men. Hephaestion hoped he did not die. A fate he was certain&nbsp;would be&nbsp;his own. <br /><br /></font></div>"

part two </font>

<lj-cut><font size=""3"">Hephaestion noticed the look that passed between his lover and the eunuch. The boy was lovely. Hephaestion couldn&#39;t blame any man for wanting him. The fact that it was his Alexander caused his stomach to twist. And yet it was an event that Hephaestion had long prepared for. He knew that it would happen at the harem of Babylon. Hephaestion had grown up in Athens. They had always had to worry about the Persians stealing the more beautiful of the Athenian children. Hephaestion himself, was always closely watched. Its harem was legendary. Even the Persian prisoners spoke to Hephaestion about the beauty behind the walls of the great city. The beauty now belonging to the new leader. For many nights Hephaestion had stayed awake, drinking in the man who lay beside him. Knowing that the years of them sleeping together were coming to an end. Hephaestion didn&#39;t want to waste a minute of it. There were several ways to react to the upcoming change in their lives. To let Alexander see his pain wouldn&#39;t be one of them. He had a busy life. An army to take care of. He knew of the importance he held in Alexander&#39;s empire. And in all honesty, looking around the harem, Hephaestion was confident of his own beauty. Alexander may be used to him. He wore a soldiers garb, but Hephaestion could outshine anybody here. When the time was right, he wouldn&#39;t be above reminding his lover of that.

When the steward arrived to show the generals to the rooms that had been prepared for them, Hephaestion didn&#39;t follow. He knew he had been assigned a room. A grand room. Second only to the king. Hephaestion had heard Alexander give the order. How ever he wanted his lover to tell him&nbsp;himself. So he walked beside the king to royal chambers, that for the first time in six years, he wouldn&#39;t share.

&quot;I wish my father could have seen this. No wonder Darius didn&#39;t want to give this up.&quot;

&quot;There is so much more to Babylon then the royal harem, Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion reproached. &quot;But I can see how it could turn a kings head. And his heart.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, it could never turn my heart. You are the only person there. It belongs to you.&quot;

&quot;Well maybe you should keep your heart. You never know who might want a piece of it.&quot;

&quot;You heard me tell the steward that you would want your own room didn&#39;t you? I thought you might need one.&quot;

&quot;I have for years, yet it never concerned you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not only that. Some of my companions are getting on my back about you. This way we can tell them you have your own room. I don&#39;t mean for us to be apart, Hephaestion. I couldn&#39;t stand it if I were to spend to many nights without you.&quot;

&quot;After six years, the harem of Babylon finally makes you listen to your advisers.&quot;

Alexander and Hephaestion had always been truthful. The king could never get anything over on his lover.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;

&quot;I saw the look you gave the raven haired beauty. You want him.&quot;

&quot;I feel so bad. I can&#39;t understand myself. A few days ago I would have killed anybody who dared tell me that I would ever want any body else. When I was in there, they made me feel so desirable. I felt powerful. I don&#39;t know how to explain it.&quot;

&quot;And I am just Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Never just anything. I may feel these things. But my feelings for you remain the same. I love you. I desire you. Nobody will ever take your place. Let me have this, Phai. Just for awhile so that I might know what it is like.&quot;

&quot;These people...these people treat you like a god. It&#39;s all right, Alexander. You and I have had our youthful love affair and it was wonderful. We will always have that memory of love. Some people never have that. Times change, my love.&quot;

&quot;You act as if we are no longer lovers. You are still my beloved.&quot;

Hephaestion smiled.

&quot;Oh yes, I know. You just send for me and let me know when you want me.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you act as if you don&#39;t care if I take another.&quot;

&quot;You have my acceptance and understanding. You want jealousy? Do you want to see me bleed, Alexander?&quot;

&quot;No. I don&#39;t want to see you in pain. I just thought........&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t caused me pain, Alexander.&quot; Hephaestion laughed. &quot;I mean after all, you aren&#39;t going to be jealous when I take a lover are you? I am still your beloved after all.&quot;

&quot;Lover?&quot; Alexander hadn&#39;t thought of that. He didn&#39;t want anyone else with Hephaestion.

&quot;Hephaestion, I don&#39;t want you to leave tonight. Not the first night. It is ours.&quot;

&quot;The grand celebration is tomorrow night. The generals don&#39;t expect to see you until tomorrow&#39;s banquet. Do me this last favor. Start tonight. I can sit with the companions for a few quiet drinks and let them know of the change in our relationship. I can get their jokes and their pity over with before the party, I ask this of you for my pride. So I may get it over with. A few will be spiteful, but it will give the younger generals a chance to welcome me into their fold. I am one of them now.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t like this.&quot;

&quot;How did you think it would go, Alexander? What do you want from me?&quot;

&quot;This is new to me also, Hephaestion. I thought we could work up to it.&quot;

&quot;What? Sleep with you every night. Wondering if it were to be the last night. Waiting to be told that you were fucking the eunuch the next night. No thank you. You want this? Fine. I am not going to be waiting for the ax to fall.&quot;

Alexander thought of Cassander and Nearchus always sniffing around Hephaestion. He almost wished he hadn&#39;t said anything. He opened his mouth to tell his lover he had changed his mind, when the eunuch in question entered the room. Alexander watched the boy arrange flowers. He was dressed seductively in a loosely tied robe, which would look good on Hephaestion.. He looked at his lover who wasn&#39;t looking at the slave, but watching Alexander.

&quot;You sent for him? Before I could even leave?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t send for him, Hephaestion. I don&#39;t know why he is here.&quot;

&quot;Sire,&quot; the young man said in flawless greek.. &quot;I am sorry for interrupting. I am the personal slave to the king. You are king. Do you wish me to leave?&quot;

The slave lowered his eyes to the floor in submission. A submission that Hephaestion wasn&#39;t fooled by. He didn&#39;t blame the boy for wanting to&nbsp;secure his place beside the king.

&quot;What is your name, boy?&quot;

&quot;Bagoas, my lord.&quot;

&quot;Bagoas, I am no lord. Like you, I serve the king.&quot; He looked at Alexander while turning to leave. Alexander looked scared.. &quot;Quite convenient, Sire. Don&#39;t look that way, Ale,&quot; Hepaistion added as he leaned over to give his lover a chaste kiss.

&quot;Hephaestion, I don&#39;t think you should be up&nbsp;drinking with the companions. You&#39;re not used to it. I&nbsp;usually can&#39;t get you away from work when we take a new city.&quot;

Hephaestion laughed.

&quot;You want me to work through the night, while you are with your boy? I think gaining knowledge of Babylon can wait until morning, Alexander. Enjoy your spoils of war, my love.&quot;

Hephaestion didn&#39;t look at Bagoas again. Nor Alexander. When he got to the door, he stopped. He didn&#39;t turn around.

&quot;Good-bye, Ale.&quot; He walked out the door. He leaned against the hard wood on the other side. He had to control his trembling. Hephaestion took a deep breath, raised his head and squared his shoulders. He took a step forward. He didn&#39;t want to think about this. But he might as well get it over with. It was just a small banquet. No dignitaries. Just the companions sharing wine and food together. He heard the subdued revelry before he entered the room. He didn&#39;t feel like eating, but a glass of wine or two may be just what he needed.

&quot;Hephaestion! It&#39;s about time,&quot; yelled Ptolemy. &quot;Where&#39;s Alexander?&quot;

&quot;We are hosting ourselves tonight, my friends.&quot; Hephaestion looked Ptolemy in the eyes. &quot;He has found other entertainment for the evening.&quot;

There was a moment of stunned silence. In that moment, the observant Hephaestion had seen the faces of his men. He saw the satisfaction on the faces of Craterus and Parminion. The smug glad look on the face of Eumennes. For him it wasn&#39;t just a personal code. It was genuine dislike of Hephaestion him self. Ptolemy and Cassander tried to hide their pity. Nearchus looked surprised. And Cleitus looked calculating.

&quot;Why? I saw nothing there that was more enchanting then you.&quot; &nbsp;The cry came from Perdichus. The kings own cousin.

&quot;You are good for me, my brother. Maybe Alexander wanted younger.&quot;

&quot;Younger?&quot; Cleitus yelled. &quot;You&#39;re only twenty-three. How much younger does he want?&quot;

&quot;Maybe he wanted new and different,&quot; Hephaestion smiled, while accepting a drink from a servant.

&quot;So do I,&quot; joked Cassander, throwing his arms around Hephaestion. &quot;You know what I think? I think he couldn&#39;t handle you anymore.&quot; He led Hephaestion to a couch, pulling him down beside him. &quot;You have friends here, Hephaestion. You are not alone, my brother.&quot;

So Hephaestion let his friends get him drunk. It wasn&#39;t long before the older generals went to their beds. The brothers in all but blood stayed with their fallen leader. It was Hephaestion who saw to their needs. And they would see to his. Not physical. His need of friendship would be a start.

The friends joked and spoke of past battles. Lost loves, and future conquests. Hephaestion was glad that he didn&#39;t get morose when he drank. His companions tried to keep his spirits up.

A couple hours before dawn it was just Cleitus and Cassander left with Hephaestion.

&quot;He put my room right next to his. Can you believe it? &nbsp;I know I need to be close, but right next door?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll get it changed tomorrow.,&quot; Cleitus promised. &quot;If there are no more available, I&#39;ll trade with you. My room is a small palace. Imagine Alexander&#39;s face when he knocks on the door and I answer.&quot;

&quot;That reminds me to check on our soldiers accommodations. And the medical staff and cooks. I should see to the Macedon whores. These people hate the Egyptians. What are&nbsp;our Egyptian followers doing?&quot; Hephaestion groggily sat up as if to start his day.

&quot;Sleep first, boy. They are all fine for now. I will go with you in the morning.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll keep Alexander from finding you before the party,&quot; Cassander said matter of factly.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to go to that room,&quot; Hephaestion slurred. The wine catching up to him.

Cleitus got up and pulled the two younger men to a large couch. More like a bed with a high leather back to it.

&quot;We have slept in worse, my brothers.&quot;

&quot;And will again no doubt,&quot; Cassander murmured.

Cleitus lay down and pulled Hephaestion after him. The younger man&nbsp;sprawled on top of him. Cassander curled up behind Hephaestion. They fell asleep like that. An hour later they were awakened by a slave with a summons for Hephaestion to go to the kings chambers. It was Cleitus who&nbsp;replied by saying that Hephaestion was unable to comply and he would see the king tomorrow. They curled back in to their comfortable cocoon and slept for several hours.

Alexander stared at the door that Hephaestion walked through. He felt as if he lost something precious. Perhaps he had. He wasn&#39;t sure how he wanted Hephaestion to respond to this change, but he knew it wasn&#39;t like that. He and Hephaestion had always talked of men having other relationships other then their mate. Alexander realized that Hephaestion scoffed at the idea of wives interfering in the bond that two men have. However he had never actually voiced much opinion on other men. Only stating how lucky the two of them were to find each other. Hephaestion hadn&#39;t said they were no longer lovers. He didn&#39;t act mad. Then how come he felt his lover drawing away? Hephaestion liked having a constant lover. Liked having someone to sleep with. Alexander realized what he may have jeopardized. And yet, almost against his will he was drawn to this Persian lifestyle. He wanted to experience it. What man wouldn&#39;t?

Bagoas had been trained to give comfort and arouse his king. He handed Alexander a glass of unmixed wine and moved behind him to&nbsp;sensually rub his shoulders and neck. Bagoas knew the one that had left was the lover. The favorite. But maybe not for much longer. Bagoas knew the allure of the harem. He moved again to the front of the chair and separated the kings robe. He held out his hand and beckoned the blond haired god to the bed. Bagoas knew his place in life, and worked to perfect it.

Alexander followed the boy. He was maybe five or six years younger then Hephaestion. He tried to quit thinking of his lover. He lay on his back and watched Bagoas crawl cat like from the foot of the bed. Very sexy. Very practiced. The eunuch licked Alexander&#39;s cock and began sucking it with exquisite precision. He was very good. Hephaestion always sucked him as if it were a last meal. Sometimes fast and crazy. Other times, a slow&nbsp;wondrous torture. Gods, he thought. Quit thinking of Hephaestion. When he was hard enough, he flipped Bagoas onto his back and lifted the long legs onto his shoulders. They were flexible, but they didn&#39;t feel as if they belonged there like Hephaestion&#39;s. Alexander avoided looking at the poor mutilated sacs and slack erection. This was difficult enough. He pushed into the boy without preparing him. A harem boy would know to prepare himself. He was right. The boy wasn&#39;t as&nbsp;deliciously tight as Hephaestion. But he knew what to do. Alexander wished he had taken the boy from behind though. He looked happy enough, but Alexander was used to seeing the joyous delight of Hephaestion&#39;s expressive features. Used to seeing the luminous blue eyes staring up at him in love. Alexander had to close his own eyes to continue. Bagoas had an orgasm of sorts which&nbsp;brought Alexander to completion. He rolled off and lay there. He wasn&#39;t sweating, his heart wasn&#39;t palpitating, his nerve endings weren&#39;t singing. It wasn&#39;t how he usually felt after sex. Bagoas handed him another large glass of unmixed wine and cleaned him off while he drank.

&quot;Do you wish me to stay, Sire?&quot; Bagoas hoped not. He hated sleeping next to the king. Even this new and beautiful king, who he would serve, didn&#39;t inspire the feelings he longed for.

&quot;No, you can leave.&quot; Alexander didn&#39;t think to thank the boy, he was just glad he was leaving. He would tell Hephaestion tomorrow that he wanted him back in his bed. He was sure his lover would be glad. Alexander longed for Hephaestion&#39;s body. They had seldom slept apart. He wanted to go to the hall and collect his lover now. Maybe the others would give him a hard time. Some of them were very protective of Hephaestion.&nbsp;Alexander decided he&nbsp;would tell his beloved the happy news at breakfast. Alexander fell asleep after yet another glass of wine. He awoke at the first hint of dawn. He would often wake Hephaestion at dawn to make love, or just to discuss the upcoming day. He got up and asked his own personal guard to send a servant after Hephaestion. He returned sometime later, unsure of this new kings temperament.

&quot;Well, is he behind you?&quot; Alexander&#39;s Persian was a little rusty. He and Hephaestion had learned it together. Hephaestion had taken to it right away.

&quot;I checked his rooms, Sire. He was not there. The bed had not been slept in, so I checked the hall where the kings men had celebrated last night. There were three men sleeping on a couch together. The one you seek was sleeping. He seemed very drunk, my king. The other tall man told me to tell you that you could see him in the morning. I am sorry, Sire. I just give the message.&quot;

Alexander waved him away. Cleitus and someone else [probably Cassander] were taking care of Hephaestion. Alexander lay back down to try and sleep a couple more hours. He was aware of his lovers whereabouts. He would again summon Hephaestion to break his fast with him in the morning. Secure that he could put things back to where they were before he fell victim of the glitter of Babylon. </font>

part one </font>

<div class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"">They were three days out from Babylon. The battle had been won. However, with the field hospital being set up, caring for the dead and wounded from both sides, rounding up the prisoners who Hephaestion insisted on feeding and dressing their wounds right along with his own men; it would be another ten days before the victory march Alexander had always dreamed of. He had sent his own&nbsp;emissary&#39;s in to prepare the&nbsp;Babylonians of the arrival of their new leader. He could not yet call himself king due to the fact that Darius had not yet been found. Patrols were leaving by the hour. It was Alexander&#39;s wishes that the Persian king be found before he set forth to the great city.

Alexander wondered where could Hephaestion have disappeared to now? He always seemed to be everywhere at once. He could often be found in the hospitals working&nbsp;tirelessly along side the doctors, caring for the wounded. Even the enemy benefited from Hephaestion&#39;s compassion.

Alexander saw Cleitus coming out from the medical tent.

&quot;Is Hephaestion in there?&quot;

&quot;Lost him again? Have you checked with the wranglers? He seemed very worried about some of the hoses. You know how he always wants to vet the horses himself.&quot;

&quot;I just came from there. They said Hephaestion had spent most of the morning there.&quot;

&quot;You need to put a bell around his neck, Cleitus laughed.&quot;

&quot;Looking for Hephaestion?&quot; Ptolemy had come around the corner of the tent lugging a small barrel of water. &quot;Alexander, he has us fetching water! Us! Can you rein him in? Take him to your tent and calm him down.&quot;

&quot;Did he say where he was going, Ptolemy?&quot;

&quot;He was mumbling about the prisoners and their horses. He was saying something about having a talk with the cooks. He was worried about enough&nbsp;supplies coming in. Who knows?You know Hephaestion, he always has ten things going on.&quot;

&quot;Where is that water?&quot; thundered a voice from within the tent.

&quot;Alexander, now he has the doctors telling us what to do. And they take advantage, the damn butchers! Will you do something?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to him, Ptolemy.&quot;

Both Cleitus and Alexander laughed when Ptolemy staggered away with his burden. Ptolemy had gotten on Hephaerstion&#39;s bad side when he was heard making jokes about Hephaestion&#39;s and Alexander&#39;s bedroom antics. Hephaestion didn&#39;t like when Alexander was brought into the joking, and everybody knew that.

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll go check with supply.&quot;

&quot;You know, you <em>are</em> the king, you can send pages for him.&quot;

&quot;I have four or five pages on any given day out searching for Hephaestion. He shows up hours later with no clue that I was searching for him. I think he does it on purpose, Cleitus.&quot;

Cleitus laughed at the kings dilemma.

&quot;You should check in the most unlikely spot.&quot;

&quot;That would be the whores.&quot;

&quot;Well, it would be unlikely.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s few places left to look. I might have to.&quot;

&quot;What if you find him there?&quot;

Cleitus burst out laughing at the kings horrified expression.

&quot;Cleitus, it&#39;s not funny.&quot;

&quot;Well, at least&nbsp;Eumenes and Craterus would be glad.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have him on a leash.&quot;

&quot;I think Hephaestion might like that. &quot;

&quot;He can see who ever he wants, Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;All right Alexander, I know.&quot;

&quot;He can.&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure, I said I know.&quot;

Alexander turned around to continue his search. Hephaestion wouldn&#39;t be with the whores. Would he? Never the less he would start there and circle the camp again. Now Alexander&#39;s own pages wouldn&#39;t be able to find him if they found Hephaestion. Why couldn&#39;t Hephaestion just tell him where he was going? He never had this problem with anybody else.

He reached the outskirts of the camp. The girls called out to him. The boys too. They had never seen him there before and they were falling all over themselves to service him. He was friendly and charming before asking about Hephaestion. The first surprise was that they knew who Hephaestion was, and they spoke of him with immense fondness. The second surprise was when one of the camp boys came forward to answer the king question.

&quot;I just saw him. He was here a few minutes ago. I think I saw him heading for that tree line with Vonna. Right over there,&quot; he said pointing to a discrete clump of trees. 

The king walked to where he was directed. On alert for anything. The whores knew who Hephaestion was. He was with one of them right now in the woods. Had Hephaestion always liked girls? Alexander was devastated. It&#39;s not as if Hephaestion couldn&#39;t. He just never did. Or so Alexander thought. Well he wanted his lover to know that the king had knowledge of his indiscretions. It was just about then that he heard Hephaestion&#39;s voice.

&quot;Let it lick your face. Look how excited he is. He knows you.&quot;

Alexander came through the bushes. His heart was pounding. Was Hephaestion that familiar with this girl?

He saw his lover on his knees holding a small&nbsp;Pekingese dog. And before him was a young child. She was no more then five. Alexander gave a sigh of relief. He couldn&#39;t tell his lover about his fear. Except Hephaestion would find out. He always found out.

&quot;Alexander, did you need me?&quot;

&quot;What are you doing?&quot;

Hephaestion narrowed his eyes.

&quot;I came to see what the girls needed for supplies. Vonna lost her dog, and asked me to help look for him. Say hello to our king, Vonna.&quot;

The little girl wrapped her arms around Hephaestion&#39;s neck and clung to him as he stood up. He held the child in one strong arm, the dog in the other.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you back to Mommy.&quot;

&quot;No! Stay with daddy.&quot;

Alexander woke up at that statement.

&quot;Daddy? Hephaestion!&quot;

&quot;She calls everybody daddy, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;No, want Hef&#39; tion to be my daddy.&quot;

After much fuss of passing the little girl and her dog over to the affectionate mother, who seemed to care very much for the kings lover, the two walked back to the kings camp. There wasn&#39;t a chance to talk, because they were stopped by no less then five people. All demanding Hephaestion&#39;s time. After a brief nod of respect to their king, they ignored him. They all needed something. Supplies, horses, answers to questions, even his help over disputes. It was as if Hephaestion was the pulse of the kings army. Even his own page who had apparently forgotten that he was on a mission to find the general, came running up asking about the mail lines.

Alexander had enough. He gave Ptolemy a dirty look when he was next to approach. He dragged Hephaestion into their tent. With threat of death, he ordered the guards to not let anybody in.

&quot;I missed you too, Alexander. But couldn&#39;t you have waited for night fall? &nbsp;It&#39;s the middle of the afternoon.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care. <em>You</em> don&#39;t either. I have been looking all over for you. And where do I find you? In the whores camp!&quot;

&quot;Who told you I went into the woods?&quot;

&quot;How should I know. Some camp boy.&quot;

&quot;Did they say with who?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Vonna.&quot;

&quot;Did they say who Vonna was?&quot;

&quot;No. That&#39;s enough, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;You thought I went into the woods with a whore didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;No. Yes. I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Hephaestion put his arms around the king. His own jealous sun god.

&quot;Since forever it&#39;s only been you, Alexander. Always you.&quot;

Alexander pulled his eager lover to their bed, and divested him of his clothing. He loved when Hephaestion was naked. He didn&#39;t undress himself. He just pulled his chiton aside and slipped his large cock out of his loin cloth. He swiped himself with oil and positioned his phallus at the opening of Hephaestion&#39;s body. He didn&#39;t prepare his lover. Sometimes they liked it a little rough.

&quot;This has got to be fast, Hephaestion. We don&#39;t always have time to cater to your sexual whims.&quot;

&quot;My whims? You........&quot;

Alexander pushed into his lover with one long stroke. Hephaestion cried out. The guards at the door of the tent smiled at each other. Most of the camp knew of Hephaestion&#39;s pleasure of sex.

Alexander, with Hephaestion&#39;s legs on his shoulders, pounded into his lover. Slamming into him hard, making him moan with every thrust. It was never enough for Hephaestion though. Alexander loved watching the uninhibited man under him. The radiant face reflecting the pure joy of having Alexander inside him. It wasn&#39;t long before they were both crying out each others names and exploding together.

It was after when Hephaestion was again dressed and ready to leave, when the king remembered his earlier complaint.

Hephaestion was kissing him good-bye and telling him he had to go check on mail lines.

&quot;Hephaestion, I need to know where you are at all times. Get more help.&quot;

&quot;But Alexander, I never know where I&#39;m going until I&#39;m halfway there. I can&#39;t check in every second.&quot;

&quot;Get some message runners. That&#39;s an order, general. I was very upset having to look for you today. That&#39;s why I took you so roughly.&quot;

&quot;Well if that&#39;s what you do when your angry,&quot; Hephaestion said, &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to anger you more often.&quot; He breezed out the door.

Alexander stood in Hephaestion&#39;s wake, shaking his head.

Hephaestion poked his head back in the door, His beautiful eyes snapping with life. The earlier desire still showing on his face.

&quot;Ale&#39;,&quot; he whispered, &quot;I&#39;ll try to let you know where I am, alright?&quot;

Who could stay mad at him.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you at supper, my love,&quot; Alexander whispered back. Gods he loved this man.

Supper in a battle camp didn&#39;t consist of much. Meat and flat bread. Wine was always served to the king and his companions. Hephaestion always tried to make sure that there was some kind of vegetable for them. Most of his friends complained about eating leaves. He also tried to make sure that the soldiers and medical staff always had wine. The medical staff had been complaining to Alexander about Hephaestion making everybody wash themselves and medical equipment all the time. They were too busy for his fastidiousness. And Ptolemy was still complaining about the medical staff.

The kings companions always shared the evening meal while in camp. When the king arrived in the tent they were already having a drink before the meal. The sides of the tent had been rolled up, due to heat, and it was cooler in the shade.

&quot;Joy to you, my friends. Where is Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;I tell you, I&#39;m getting that boy a bell,&quot; Cleitus snickered.

&quot;You&nbsp;probably wore him out today , Alexander,&quot; Nearchus teased. &quot;We all heard your afternoon tryst. We even heard you this time, Alexander. Hephaestion must be a demon in bed.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t let Hephaestion hear you. He had me carrying water all day, because of my teasing last night. It is an abuse of his power, Alexander.&quot;

Ptolemy did not seem to be angry. He just liked to complain of Hephaestion&#39;s tyranny.

&quot;Has anybody seen him lately?&quot; 

It was one of Alexander&#39;s own pages who spoke up.

&quot;Sire, he told me to tell you he had to make sure the prisoners didn&#39;t get slop to eat.&quot;

&quot;We have people for that. Why does Hephaestion think he has to do&nbsp;everything?&quot;&nbsp;Eumenes was always grumbling about Hephaestion.

&quot;Because Hephaestion thinks he has to check on everything. Keeps people on their toes.&quot; Ptolemy joked.

Nearchus projected an air of astonishment.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe he told you where he was going.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t last. Better still get that bell,&quot; joked Cleitus

Hephaestion strolled in. He had bathed. He hated the grime from camp, and always bathed first chance he could get.

&quot;I&#39;m so hungry. I hope there is something good to eat.&quot; He stared dejectedly at the plate he was given. It consisted of boar and some bread. Again. There were some olives, </font><font size=""3"">artichokes, and nuts, which he ate first, and then resigned himself to eat the greasy meat.

&quot;Where were you, Hephaestion? The prisoners ate two hours ago.&quot; Craterus asked. He was always interested in the coming and goings of Hephaestion&#39;s life.

&quot;Zeus, nobody else in this camp has to report their day as much as I do.&quot;

Alexander smiled at his lovers outburst.

&quot;We are interested, Hephaestion. You hold our camp in your hand.&quot;

&quot;When we were in Egypt, I noticed that they had fields of oats growing along the nile beside the cotton. They had whole granaries going to waste. It seems they use the stalks for straw and bricks, but prefer to eat the wheat. I arranged to have a constant supply of it as well as wheat and cotton. It&#39;s good to eat. And it will be food for our horses when we again journey to new lands. I sent my own emissary with your seal to arrange it, Sire.&quot;

Once again the companions shook their heads at Hephaestion&#39;s decisiveness. Alexander had always known of his lovers&nbsp;genius.

&quot;Nearchus, did I hear you making fun of the king before I came in?&quot; Hephaestion enquired, looking pointedly at the seafarer.

&quot;No! I swear I didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I think Ptolemy needs help with the water tomorrow.&quot;

Nearchus groaned while the others laughed.

&quot;An abuse of power, Alexander,&quot; Ptolemy said good naturedly.

By the time Alexander an Hephaestion were finally alone and able to go to bed, the heat of the day became cool.

Alexander undressed his lover for the second time that day. It was like unwrapping a prize. In Macedonia, Hephaestion&#39;s beauty was legendary. But here in the kings bed, he had never looked so lovely.

&quot;You have had a full day, my love. Delegate tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have to. I&#39;m on scout detail with Cassander.&quot;

&quot;You do enough. Let Neachus go.&quot;

&quot;Alexander,&quot; his lover warned.

Alexander sighed. He was never able to tell his&nbsp;obstinate lover what to do.

&quot;Sire, I need you to be inside me. I have need of you.&quot;

&quot;What if I want something else?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll lay you down and ravish you when we get to Babylon. I&#39;ll take you hard all night. But this is not even our regular camp set up. It&#39;s not our regular walled tent. And we are too close together. I won&#39;t have the whole camp hearing your screams of pleasure.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good for them to hear yours?&quot;

&quot;It makes you look all powerful, Sire. Make love to me now please Ale&#39;.&quot;

Alexander grinned. This was an order he would always follow. </font>

"event","<font size=""3"">EROMENOS<br />epilogue</font><br /><br /><lj-cut><lj-cut><font size=""3"">The lovers lay entwined on the bed of the prince. The moon was full and casting a glow upon the two. Alexander was awake, not quite believing that he was finally here with Hephaestion in his arms. It seemed like forever since he had been away. He thought about what he had come home too. Instead of crazed king and distraught lover, he found a camaraderie, that wasn&#39;t there before he fled. Leave it to Hephaestion to turn a violent situation into something mutually acceptable. Alexander watched his lover sleep. The moonlight brought out Hephaestion&#39;s radiance. Hephaestion had done nothing but prove his devotion to Alexander, yet still, the prince&#39;s&nbsp;insecurities weakened him. Alexander knew himself to be beautiful. Many had shown they wanted him. And when he was king, he knew that he could have non stop lovers if he so wanted them. So could Hephaestion. He could now.&nbsp; Hepheastion&#39;s beauty would become legend. &nbsp;Would his lover take the offers. Alexander would invade nations and thus&nbsp;unite the world which would bow at his feet. However, he was nothing if Hephaestion wasn&#39;t beside him.&nbsp; Alexander thought of the dinner they had attended that evening.<br /><br />&quot;Your father and Cleitus will be waiting. I just want to finish this last picture. Their anniversary is next week. With the wedding celebrations starting tomorrow, I won&#39;t have time to finish. I have your needs to see to after all,&quot; Hephaestion grinned impishly. &quot;Half hour, I promise.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander looked at the picture that Hephaestion had started yesterday. He remembered both his father and Cleitus trying to see it, but his lover stayed firm. The four of them had decided to ride to nearby caves. Caves, Hephaestion had never seen. They explored, and stole kisses while the other couple wasn&#39;t looking. They talked about Phillip&#39;s new baby. A baby that Hephaestion and Cleitus seemed to want to raise themselves, much to the amusement of the king and prince. Phillip and Cleitus told stories of their youth. Telling of how they explored the caves twenty years before. The four had brought blankets,&nbsp;wine, and food. They sat around joking while Hephaestion drew, trying to capture the moment. He put himself and Alexander in the picture, along with the king and his long time lover. It would be a memory for all of them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hephaestion entered the&nbsp;banquet room for yet another celebration. He would be glad when the wedding/baby celebrating would be over.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cassander was standing inside the doorway. Hephaestion knew that Cassander had been in Athens with his father. He had not seen the man since he had tried to help him, several weeks before. Invoking Cleius&#39;s anger, and Phillip&#39;s amusement.<br /><br />They greeted each other fondly. Hepheastion asking about Cassander&#39;s journey. They talked about Athens, which Hephaestion sometimes missed.<br /><br />&quot;You are alright then, Hephaestion? &nbsp;It was more then what you said, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It was. It worked out well though. Phillip and Alexander are very close still. He is heir. And Cleitus has his king&#39;s back.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You have a great calling for diplomacy, my friend,&quot; Cassander laughed. He admired Hephaestion&#39;s beauty. But Cassander admired his mind more. The smart man recognized Hephaestion&#39;s gentle steel like strength. Cassander would enjoy watching Hephaestion&#39;s rise in ranks. &quot;I would have helped you, you know. For our friendship, as well as for our prince.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That&#39;s what makes you one of my greatest friends. Lets stay true to this friendship all through our upcoming&nbsp;journeys to new nations. I have your back as well, Cassander.&quot;<br /><br />The two forged a bond that day, that Hephaestion hoped would never be broken.<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion, I would like to ask you something. A favor.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Anything.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have seen your pictures. I don&#39;t know how long our king and prince will keep us away from home. Or what may happen. Would you draw my likeness for my mother and father? I know they would cherish it as their greatest gift.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion was touched and honored to do that for his friend, and told him so. The two of them clasped each other close and hugged for lengthy time. They parted&nbsp;with promises to get together after the wedding,&nbsp;where Hephaestion promised to draw yet more pictures.<br /><br />It was that long hug that had inflamed Alexander&#39;s jealousies. After they had gotten back to their room, Alexander angrily confronted Hephaestion.<br /><br />&quot;How do you ever expect me to free you when you are throwing yourself at every man out there?&quot;<br /><br />A comment that instead of angering Hephaestion because of it&#39;s unfairness, amused him.<br /><br />&quot;You know that&#39;s not true, Alexander. And no amount of ownership papers can buy my devotion to you. I am loyal because of love. Free me, and I am yours forever. Bind me, and I long to be free. Alexander, I love you. Only you. Always...........Oh and Alexander, before we fight about this more as I am tempted to do, your father has already signed my papers. To me. I am a free man.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander, was dumbfounded. But not a man that couldn&#39;t access a situation.<br /><br />&quot;I have been silly?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes. You know, I have far more reason for jealousy then you. Many will love you. I might have to stand in line.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Never, Hephaestion. I will never lose you by taking another. Except for wives. A&nbsp;necessary evil for us both,&quot; he added thinking of his mother. &quot;So are you mad at my jealousy?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, I rarher like it. It makes you into a very dominate lover.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And you like that, my little wildcat?&quot;<br /><br />Before Hephaestion could answer, Alexander pounced. Instead of growling, Hephaestion purred. Purred loudly. Much to the dismay of the king who swore he was having a wing put on for his son and lover.<br /><br /><br />The funeral games were over. Alexander&#39;s own friends had killed Pausanias. Alexander separated himself from his mother. Paminion had executed General Attalus. The great king was dead. Alexander already started&nbsp;planning the invasion of Persia. He gathered the armies, convinced his people, found doctors, cooks, wranglers, appointed his generals and his own companions, everything and everybody he would need to move a mobile city. An army that nobody could imagine. With Alexander quickly taking up the reins of the nation, they hardly had time to mourn. Including Alexander, who didn&#39;t want to think of his father.<br /><br />&quot;You may not want to think and to feel, but others do,&quot; Hephaestion scolded. &quot;Today is the day of your fathers and Cleitus&#39;s anniversary.. He needs us. How would you feel if it were I that died, Alexander? Or worse, How do you think I could live without you? I am going to his new rooms and bringing the memory book. Come with me now.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander knew that by the tone of Hephaestion&#39;s voice he dare not disobey. Nor did he want to.<br /><br /><br />The three of them all sat on Cleitus&#39;s bed, sipping wine.They were looking at the pictures of Phillip&#39;s likeness. Cleitus had been moved to tears. He was even more glad when Hephaestion told him that Phillip forced him to show the king the pictures some time ago. So he had seen them before he died. Except the last one, of the picnic by the caves. A wonderful day for them all.<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion, you have given me back my lover twice now. This is the greatest gift I could ever receive. Thank you. I am in your dept. Your father and I always believed in an afterlife. I know I will see him after my time on this land is over. Until then, I have this whenever I want to see his face.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus,&quot; Alexander asked softly. &quot;You will be going with me, won&#39;t you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, my boy. I promised Phillip I would always take care of you. And you too Hephaestion. Somebody has to keep you in line on our journey. Just promise me Alexander, promise me you won&#39;t leave me as satrap at some godforsaken land.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Never, you will be with us till the end. I would be afraid that if I did that, it would set off an awful chain of events&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Superstition,&quot; Cleitus laughed.<br /><br />&quot;No, my friend, a feeling.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, I trust your feelings.Your father did too.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I miss him,&quot; Hephaestion said. &quot;The gruff old man sure had a way about him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He hated when you called him old man. But it kept him acting young.&quot;<br /><br />The three laughed at the memory, enjoying each others company. A loving quiet space in time, that there wouldn&#39;t be much of in the years ahead.<br /><br />&quot;So, how do you like the new room?&quot; Hephaestion asked. &quot;You know, you didn&#39;t have to vacate the king&#39;s rooms. They were your rooms also.&quot;<br /><br />&quot; I am very happy with them. At least this way, I don&#39;t have to listen to your screams while you have sex.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander&#39;s head snapped up.<br /><br />&quot;Oh by the gods! You hear us having sex?&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus and Hephaestion laughed. And somewhere Phillip did too.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END</font></lj-cut></lj-cut><br /><br />"

He had been escorted back to the royal chamber after sitting in on a meeting with yet another emissary of Athens. He now sat drawing in a sketch book. He was so engrossed in his picture he didn&#39;t hear the door open or the king enter the room. Didn&#39;t know the man was standing behind him watching him draw.<br /><br />&quot;That&#39;s very good. May I see?&quot;<br /><br />The startled Hephaestion jumped and slammed the book shut.<br /><br />&quot;Sire, I did not expect you back for some time. I mean so soon. I..... &quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion, may I see your work? I have seen other pictures you have drawn. Alexander shows everybody your work. I see you were drawing Cleitus and I.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh Sire, it was a surprise for you and Cleitus. He told me some time ago that you and he have a anniversary coming up. Twenty years. I wanted to make you both something.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It can still be a surprise for Cleitus. Please son, I would like to see.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion handed the book to Phillip, who waved it away. Instead he sat beside Hephaestion, putting the book on both of their laps.<br /><br />&quot;I see you drawing pictures for Alexander all the time. I will be glad for Cleitus and I to have a visual memory.&quot;<br /><br />It was a narrow book, with leather covers. Bound together by a thin piece of rawhide. The covers themselves had drawings on them. The head of both Phillip and Cleitus had been burned into the leather. Hephaestion had then used a hot stick to burn the palace and mountains of Macedon in the background. The first few pictures had obviously been done before Phillip&#39;s crazed night.<br /><br />The first picture was of Phillip and Cleitus standing outside of the kings tent. By the background scenery, it was on the last campaign to Athens. It was a private moment. Cleitus was tying the kings cape under his chin. Phillip was looking up at him adoringly. The teasing look on Cleitus&#39;s face was one of tender love. The second picture was the same camp, only this time they were walking with Alexander between them. You could see the pride all three men had in each other. The love was apparent. Phillip&#39;s fingers hovered over the likeness of his son.<br /><br />&quot;It will be alright, Sire. You&#39;ll see.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You only ever see his good side.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I see his demons, but I have faith in his heart.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You love him very much, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Very much,&quot; Hephaestion teased. &quot;I am glad you bought me. I may have never met him otherwise.&quot;<br /><br />The next picture was just Alexander and Phillip talking. Phillip had his arm around his son. The same for the next, only this time it was Alexander and Cleitus..<br /><br />Phillip gaped at the next picture. It was He and Cleitus in their bed, naked. Cleitus was leaning over his lover ready to kiss him. They looked young and very beautiful.<br /><br />&quot;I opened the door one night, soon after I said good night. I wanted to see enough to be able to draw one picture of your love. Alexander likes those kind of pictures. I have to stare at ourselves in the mirror. You should try that. It&#39;s nice to watch yourselves.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;My son is crazed by you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, thank Zeus.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You make us look beautiful.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Together you are.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is a gift beyond compare. Cleitus will love this.&quot;<br /><br />The last picture was of the three of them in the kings sitting room off of his private garden. Hephaestion often sat with them, drawing while the two of them talked. That was what he drew.<br />Himself drawing, the two lovers of twenty years sitting close together. You could see the artists sketch pad in the picture, and on it were the words, &#39;Happy Anniversary&#39;. Hephaestion hoped they didn&#39;t mind him putting himself in the picture.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t have words. I couldn&#39;t ever wish for more for Cleitus and I.. I have never had such a thoughtful gift. We will treasure it forever.&quot; Phillip was thoughtful for a moment before continuing. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we have been lovers twenty years. He was such a snotty kid. Still is a brat.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion had tears in his eyes. He hoped that Alexander and he still loved after twenty years. Without the angst that the other two had gone through. Hephaestion was happy that he was a part of this family.<br /><br />&quot;I have had your papers sealed, son. They are now yours. You are free.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion was shocked. He had dreamed of freedom and yet.............<br /><br />&quot;What is it?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am pleased, Sire. I know it&#39;s silly, but I always dreamed of the day that Alexander would free me.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip knew his son. He had his mothers fears and jealousies.<br /><br />&quot;I think you might&#39;ve waited for awhile. He likes the idea of owning you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know. That&#39;s why I wanted him to free me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t worry son. You&#39;ll have more freedom to rise in the army if you&#39;re free. Besides it will keep Alexander on his toes if he thinks that he could lose you so easily.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;re evil.&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus came in. Fortunately Phillip had closed the book and handed it off to Hephaestion, who slipped it in his beg.<br /><br />&quot;He&#39;s here, boys. He&#39;s on the stairs. Be....&quot;<br /><br />Both Phillip and Hephaestion had stood up when Alexander burst into the room. He smelled of fresh air and sweat. Leather and horses. He looked wild. He took in the scene. Saw Phillip and Hephaestion standing by the couch. Saw the lingering tears in his lovers eyes. He literally flew at Phillip. Hit him with a flying punch to knock the king out cold. He stared wildly at Cleitus, who just backed up, not protecting his king. He figured Alexander deserved one good hit.<br /><br />Alexander pulled Hephaestion to him, wrapping his arm around tightly around his waist.<br /><br />&quot;When he wakes up, you tell him....tell him that if he ever comes near Hephaestion again, I&#39;ll kill him. Do you hear me? I&#39;ll kill him.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion had buried his face into Alexander&#39;s neck. Loving his smell. Loving the feel of his beloved&#39;s arm around him. Alexander. At last.<br /><br />Alexander looked at him, gripped his chin and smashed their lips together.<br /><br />&quot;Lets go. I heard they kept you here. Grab your sketches. I know you have some. We&#39;ll send for your clothes later.&quot;<br /><br />With his arm still holding Hephaestion against him, they walked around his father.<br /><br />&quot;Thank you for the escort. You were right about Attalus,&quot; was all he said to Cleitus before they left.<br /><br />The lovers entered their room that hadn&#39;t been used since the night before the assault. Hephaestion still clung to Alexander. In his relief of his lovers return, he was crying, he was so happy.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s alright Hephaestion. I won&#39;t ever let them hurt you again. If I have to, I&#39;ll kill for the crown. But they won&#39;t ever have you. Shh baby. It&#39;s alright.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Make love to me Alexander.. I need you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Let me bathe first. I haven&#39;t been in water for over a week.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t care. I love your scent..&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;Baby, the servant is filling the bath now. Come sit with me. We can talk.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You don&#39;t want me, do you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You are all I dream of. Come.&quot;<br /><br />While Alexander bathed, Hephaestion talked. He told Alexander that it was only the first night that he had been violated. Hephaestion told Alexander of Phillips softness during the rape, and how he could hardly finish the job. He didn&#39;t tell him that Cleitus had finished. He talked of Cleitus&#39;s protection, for which Alexander felt much gratitude. He told him of forgiveness and drink. He told him of the friendship he felt for the king and his lover. They were all bound because of Alexander.<br /><br />&quot;I have been worried sick. I wish I had word of your safety.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I did send word. With Tolus. Didn&#39;t he tell you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He is Cleitus&#39;s man. The bastard probably wanted me to suffer a little more..&quot;<br /><br />&quot;More likely wanted to see your reaction when you got home. Alexander, you knocked your father out cold.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He deserved more. I should still kill him for what he did.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No Alexander. It is time to forgive. Our nation needs it&#39;s king and prince united.......Ale&#39; are you mad that someone else had me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am angry at the circumstances. Never at you. You are no different. Gods Hephaestion, you are so beautiful. I have been in agony imagining such horrific things.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know. I could sense your pain. You are here now. Lets not leave our room for days.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander took Hephaestion gently into his arms and held him. Cherished him there. He put both hands on Hephaestion&#39;s cheeks and tilted his face up to look into the luminous eyes. Saw the love reflected there and returned it.<br /><br />&quot;I can&#39;t wait any longer, my love. Let me have you now.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander kissed his lover, sucked gently on his lips and tongue, before kissing down his smooth chest. He buried his face between Hephaestion&#39;s strong thighs and took the leaking phallus into his mouth. Hephaestion moaned at the intense heat. Alexander licked around the mushroom head, sucking softly on the main vein at the side, before sucking him fully into his mouth. Hephaestion&#39;s moans were making his own member leak. He wanted to be in his writhing lover, but he wanted him incoherent with need first. Before Hephaestion could spend, Alexander put his hands on Hephaestion&#39;s hips and lifted him until he could get his lips on the puckered entrance. His mouth watered and drooled at the sight that awaited him. Longing to taste his lover, he dove in. Licking the opening before plunging his tongue inside, making Hephaestion cry out his need. He licked and sucked Hephaestion&#39;s opening until his lover was literally crying and begging to be allowed to come. Alexander moved up and over his lover entering him in one long stroke. The feeling was so intense that they both were in tears of ecstasy. Alexander pumped his hips, holding Hephaestion&#39;s legs up, watching his cock disappear into his lovers grasping body. Hephaestion didn&#39;t need long. He came forcefully, crying out his lovers name. Alexander felt Hephaestion clamp down on his cock, the feeling propelling him into his own desperate orgasm.<br /><br />&quot;I love you,&quot; he cried, holding his weeping lover to him tightly. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br /><br />In another room. The sitting room off the garden balcony belonging to the king, Phillip and Cleitus met each others eyes at the first scream of Hephaestion.<br /><br />&quot;They are at it again. Maybe they don&#39;t know that their bedroom borders our sitting room,&quot; the king murmured. A little embarrassed at listening to his son have sex.<br /><br />Phillip&#39;s bad eye was bruised. It was a good thing Alexander hadn&#39;t hit him in his good eye. He would be blinded. It was a good hit, Phillip thought proudly.<br /><br />&quot;Maybe we should think about moving them to another room. Or adding on a whole new wing for those two.&quot; Cleitus smiled broadly after hearing another loud scream.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#39;t know what we are going to do when we are on campaign. The whole camp will hear them.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The whole camp has heard you for years and never said anything.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No! They have not. I&#39;m not loud.&quot; The king was mortified.<br /><br />&#39;&quot;Those two are giving me ideas. I think I need to prove how loud you can be. Right here. Let them hear us.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip watched his tall strong lover move steadily towards him. Cleitus could be very domineering and Phillip loved it.<br /><br />Cleitus yanked the kings garments and with one pull Phillip&#39;s robe was laying on the floor, baring the kings strong body for viewing. Cleitus held Phillip&#39;s one good eye while he disrobed. The king was squirming under the mesmerizing stare.<br /><br />When Cleitus was naked, he put two of his fingers inside the kings mouth.<br /><br />&quot;Suck them Get them good and wet.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Cleitus pushed his lover around and bent him over the back of the couch, pushing his wet fingers into the kings hole.<br /><br />&quot;Yes. That&#39;s it. Cry out.&quot;<br /><br />After a few twists, Cleitus pulled out, making his lover moan..<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Sire.&quot; Cleitus pushed his large cock into the waiting entrance. Phillip cried out his pleasure as Cleitus continued to fuck him hard. Just like he knew the king enjoyed it.<br /><br />For the two weeks that Hephaestion had shared the kings chambers, they had been very quiet when they made love. Cleitus often kissing his lover or holding his hand over his mouth during orgasm. Not this time. Upon completion, they both cried out their love for the other.<br /><br /><br />Alexander and Hephaestion picked their heads up when they heard the sounds of lovemaking coming from the balcony sitting room, opposite the prince&#39;s bedroom.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, by the Gods, it&#39;s..........&quot;<br /><br />&quot;......Your father and Cleitus having sex,&quot; Hephaestion finished for him. Silently laughing at his lovers reaction.<br /><br />&quot;I can&#39;t lay here and listen to this, Hephaestion. My father is getting fucked! Oh Gods, we need a new room!&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></p></lj-cut></lj-cut></lj-cut></lj-cut></lj-cut></lj-cut></lj-cut>"

"event","<font size=""3"">THE EROMENOS<br /><br />PART SEVEN </font><div class=""ljcut""><br /><div class=""ljcut""><br /><font size=""3"">Phillip and Cleitus sat on chairs opposite the sleeping Hephaestion.&nbsp; Phillip sipped his tea and tried to figure out what to say to the boy once he awoke.<br /><br />&quot;Just tell the boy you're sorry, Phillip.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don't think that will be enough.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip for all his bluster, hated that he had hurt his son's lover. He put his head in his hands. It still ached from last nights drunkenness. He wished he had been stronger. If only he had told his people that Alexander was heir to his throne. That no&nbsp; baby that in all likelihood he wouldn't see grow up, could ever take the place of his son. Alexander had already proved his worth. Phillip should have been stronger. If he hadn't been drinking he would have been stronger. He was the one that had united Macedonia. Made Macedon a power that even the Persians feared. What had Phillip feared? Was it just his sub- conscience wanting a go at the boy he had lusted after for years? No, because Phillip had been happy for Alexander when he found the beauty loved his son. It had been worth the buying price to get the boy away from his mother.&nbsp; No, he had betrayed his son to settle his own affairs. He had hurt the boy with the gift of language, who sat beside him in meetings. The boy with the ready smile for the father of his lover.<br /><br />&quot;Phillip.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;Phillip,&quot; Cleitus said a little louder.<br /><br />&quot;I am sorry I made you a party to this, Cleitus.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And you are going to make it right. You will find the lad very forgiving. It must be his Athenian nature. He sure doesn't have a Macedonian's quest for vengeance. They are strange people.&quot;<br /><br />A small giggle was heard from the couch. Hephaestion poked his head out.<br /><br />&quot;Oh good, tea. Pour me a cup, Phillip.&quot;<br /><br />Both Phillip and Cleitus were shocked&nbsp; at the&nbsp;familiarity to the king. Shocked more by the gentle teasing. Never the less Phillip poured the boy a cup of tea. He took it to Hephaestion and knelt before the young man, humbling himself.<br /><br />&quot;I am appalled by my actions, young Hephaestion. I seek your forgiveness.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It wasn't pleasant. But, I don't want to spend my days being angry at my king. I think you should listen to the council of your beloved, and leave the drinking to others. It is unbecoming in a man as great as you. Do get off your knee's, Sire. I forgive you.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip took the scolding under Cleitus's amused stare. He got off the knee's that creaked when he rose.<br /><br />&quot;It is Alexander, who might find it harder to forgive,&quot; Hephaestion added. &quot;I will help him to forgive though. Can I go to meet him, now?&quot;<br /><br />Phillip looked to Cleitus who could sum up any situation quickly. His general shook his head.<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry, lad. It is not safe. Though he would deny evil intent, the soldiers of Attalus are around. They would enjoy finding the lover of the prince alone. You may sleep in the queens chamber. It is never used, but kept clean by the hopeful servants. I am sorry, son. By my very hand, I have sentenced you to imprisonment. At least until Alexander gets back.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am a soldier also, my king. I can protect myself.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know, son. But,&nbsp; Alexander is a prince. They would not dare to harm him in the palace, or you. He shouldn't be long. It is a twelve day round trip to Epirus. He must get his harpy mother settled. Two weeks, wouldn't you figure,Cleitus?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Barring mishap,yes.&quot;<br /><br />For the first time that morning, Hephaestions gentle nature and teasing strength seemed to desert him.<br /><br />&quot;Are you alright, Hephaestion?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am fine, Cleitus. I didn't sleep well. Will you show me to my room?&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus took Hephaestion to the Queens chamber. The drought that he had given the boy only a few hours ago, was making him sleepy. Cleitus pulled a blanket over the boy and watched him cuddle in. He lay on his stomach this time. His back would be tender for days to come.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus, is Alexander going to be alright?&nbsp; Is he in danger?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You make a good point, boy. I will look into the matter.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Can you send out a patrol to meet him?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, and intercept any that have the same idea. I will let it be known that he has the protection of his father.&quot;<br /><br />Thank you, Cleitus.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You sleep now child. I will wake you for lunch. We will break our fast in the kings own dining hall. Is that alright?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I would enjoy that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It took a brave man to be so forgiving, young soldier.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I just don't want to hate Alexander's father. It will help Ale' to forgive if I am alright.&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus watched him yawn, and fall asleep, and left to talk to Phillip.<br /><br />&quot;I need to know that he is safe here,while I leave.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Where are you going?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I worry about Alexander. I'm sure that others have heard that he accompanied his mother to Epirus in the middle of the night. And that he will return.&quot;<br /><br />'You shouldn't have told him to leave then,&quot; Phillip scowled.<br /><br />&quot;Sire, you mean his mother harm.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well I think she means me harm.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is good she is away for awhile. Phillip, is Hephaestion safe here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, yes. Why do you ask me that?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You know why I ask, my love. I will be back for lunch. I told Hephaestion we would dine in our private hall.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I think I told&nbsp; Pausanias to meet me there later today.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;When was this?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Last night.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;By the hand of almighty Zeus! Phillip, if you don't get rid of that boy, I won't be responsible for what I do.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will. I told you I would.,&quot; Phillip said in a petulant voice. He was defensive about causing so much pain in those he loved.<br /><br />&quot;I will be back in a while.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip looked in on Hephaestion, glad for the boys sleep. Phillip was tired himself. Feeling the effects from last nights debauchery. A nap until the return of his lover would do him well. His guests could entertain themselves. He didn't feel like seeing them anyway.<br /><br />It was over two hours later that the king awoke to feel his muscular leg being stroked by Cleitus.<br /><br />&quot;Are you ever going to wake up?&quot; Cleitus asked, leaning down to kiss his king. &quot;Tonight we are going to close the door to Hephaestion's room. You are going to spend the night *making it up* to me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I hate it when you start something and&nbsp;are unable&nbsp;finish.&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus laughed and turned when he heard Hephaestion enter.<br /><br />&quot;I am going to the dining hall. You two can have your privacy.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No! The palace is filled to capacity with&nbsp;unmerciful guests.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have always given free rein of the taking of non&nbsp;free men. You will be shadowed by us for awhile. Accept it, soldier......Cleitus, have you found out anything?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;All is well, Sire. Just&nbsp;unecessary caution.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion breathed a sigh of relief. He took Cleitus's words at face value. Phillip however wasn't fooled. He was sure he would hear more later.<br /><br />&quot;I have ordered baths for the two of you. I had mine while you slept.&quot; Sensing their vulnerability, Cleitus informed them that the baths were in both the kings and queens bathrooms<br /><br />Later at lunch, it was an upbeat Hephaestion who kept the king and his lover entertained of stories about his learning of languages. The boy had a gift of putting people at ease. He could win a battle without ever&nbsp;lifting a sword. He kept the two laughing about times when he would say something meaning another. He had traded himself for a sick cow, and sold his grandmother to a traveling actor from Rome. All in one day.<br /><br />After lunch it was time to brave the lions den. It was early, but better to get it over with. The trio headed for the entertainment hall.<br /><br />Phillip kept his promise and asked for juice, which made both Cleitus and Hephaestion smile at him proudly. These two made him feel good about himself. He smiled back and squeezed both their hands.<br /><br />It was that which the congregation witnessed. They had all heard about Alexander's flight into the wild country. Was Phillip now with the lover of his son? Most laughed and joked like the men they were.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two did not. Pausanias watched his lover lavish&nbsp;attention on the Athenian. Cleitus he could except. But another boy? No.<br /><br />Attalus watched also. Watched the king who had given him a&nbsp;glimpse&nbsp;at power, only to snatch it away.<br /><br />Cassander, who happened to be in the hall on a mission for his father, watched Hephaestion sit between the king and his first general.&nbsp; He too had heard about Alexander's dash into the night, and witnessed the prince's lover being taken away screaming last night.<br /><br />&quot;Joy to you, Sire. Hello general Cleitus. Hephaestion, might I have a word?&quot;<br /><br />It was Cleitus who answered.<br /><br />&quot;No, go away.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion, do you fare well?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am fine, Cassander. It was just a private attack on General Attalus. Don't say anything though. And Phillip and Cleitus are watching over me while Alexander is taking the queen on vacation.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Are you sure, Hephaestion?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cassander, I am well. As you can see, I am in fine company. Health to you my friend.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Get the hades out of here, Cassander,&quot; Cleitus growled. &quot;I need to see the hall.&quot;<br /><br />Cassander just knelt at Hephaestion's feet.<br /><br />Phillip looked at Cleitus with one eye opened wide.<br /><br />&quot;What is it about my son, that he inspires such loyalty?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Is Alexander alright, Sire?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Go away now, son of Antipetar. All is fine here. I applaud your tenacity..&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cassander rose in youthful dignity. &quot;Please call me if there is anything I can do for my king. Hephaestion, are you available later?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cassander, he is not available. Get out of here now.&quot;<br /><br />After he left, the king looked at Hephaestion teasingly.<br /><br />&quot;Another man in love with you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Cassander? He is just loyal to the prince.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;My King,&quot; Cleitus interrupted. &quot;I have to go. Do you need to be doing anything?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not today. I will show Hephaestion my garden..&quot;<br /><br />&quot;May we stop at my prince's room so I can get some things?&nbsp; Hephaestion had seen the leers given to him by the free soldiers of Attalus. Suddenly he was glad to be occupying the queens rooms. He hoped Alexander would hurry.<br /><br />Later after a visit to his and Alexander's room, they ran into Pausanias. Phillip stopped to talk to him, asking Hephaestion to wait. The boy cried a little and shot daggers with his eyes at Hephaestion.<br /><br />&quot;He seemed upset,&quot; Hephaestion said after the king rejoined him.<br /><br />&quot;He will get over it. They always do. He thinks you're my new eromenos.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You told him differently, right?&quot;<br /><br />Phillip just gave a little smile.<br /><br /><br />Alexander had left his mother with the promise that he would see that she was able to get back to her own brothers wedding. A brother she had not seen in five years. It was not the fault of she and her brother that the king had lost his mind.<br /><br />Alexander rode hard. He had just three men of his fathers cavalry guard. He hadn't the time to gather more. He had to leave several men with his mother. He didn't talk to his small unit as he rode, and&nbsp;he wouldn't take much food. His dreams were filled with the sight of Hephaestion's abused body. The sounds of Hephaestion's screams. Alexander's own name being called out as Hephaestion was carried to the kings chamber.<br /><br />Alexander wouldn't stop at all if it weren't for the health of his horses. He couldn't even stand being in his own skin. He wished he could be like a bird, and fly straight as&nbsp;the eagle to be with his lover. What would he find when he arrived in Pella. Had Hephaestion been beaten more? Cleitus said he would take care of him. But, if Phillip could betray his son, then what chance could a lover do? Had Hephaestion been passed around like he had seen the king pass around Pausanias?&nbsp; How many times had his innocent Hephaestion been raped. A cold hand of dread gripped his heart in it's icy grasp. What if Hephaestion had been raped by many. His father wouldn't do that, would he? Had Hephaestion been beaten and raped while calling out Alexander's name? Wondering why his lover wouldn't help him?&nbsp; An anguished moan escaped his lips. He was unmindful of the tears that streaked his face.<br /><br />Alexander was sickened as another thought came to him. What if Hephaestion fell into the hands of Attalus. What if Hephaestion wasn't alright? How would he be able to help him recover?&nbsp; He hoped his lover knew why Alexander had to pick the crown that night..&nbsp; He knew if the king left his baby the crown then it would be the sadistic general who would rule until the child was old enough. He also knew that an accident would suddenly befall the king within months of the baby's birth.<br /><br />Attalus would come for Alexander. He would have to stay alert.&nbsp; Did Hephaestion know this? Know that he couldn't leave his kingdom in the hands of that madman.&nbsp; Would Hephaestion's beautiful face ever gaze upon him in joy again?&nbsp; Alexander had to get back to Pella. Had to confront his father who had&nbsp;orchestrated this entire thing. He had to&nbsp;rescue his lover.<br /><br />The prince was just two days out from Pella, when soldiers were sighted in the distance. Alexander thought this might be the attack he had anticipated. There were over one hundred men. There would be no fighting them. Maybe outsmarting or outrunning. But, a scout was drawing near, so any contingency was to late. 'Oh, my beloved Hephaestion'.&nbsp; was all Alexander could think. As the rider drew close, Alexander saw that it wasn't one of Attalus's soldiers. It was a man from first unit. Cleitus had sent them.<br /><br />&quot;Prince Alexander, we have been sent to offer you safe escort to Pella.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Is there any reason to believe my journey might not be safe if you hadn't arrived?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;General Cleitus thought so, my prince.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Then I welcome your escort, soldier.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Tolus, sir.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Welcome Tolus. I wish to ride alone. Do not be offended.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Of course not, my prince.&quot;<br /><br />It was just the next day , when Alexander rounded a corner of the road. More soldiers. Fifty maybe. They stopped for a moment when they saw the contingency behind the prince.<br /><br />Tolus rode up beside Alexander.<br /><br />&quot;We are not to engage, Alexander. Cleitus knew they would come. He said to watch and listen.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander didn't answer. He couldn't be bothered. The soldiers were between he an his lover.<br /><br />The riders rode in to join with Alexander's group. It was General Attalus, and they were outnumbered two to one.<br /><br />&quot;Prince Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;General Attalus. Why are you here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Regular patrol. I am glad you have so much escort. General Cleitus's men, are they not?<br /><br />&quot;Attalus, I don't have time for this. Have you come to engage?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I wouldn't think of it, my prince,&quot; the sinister general answered. &quot;Please do not let me keep you. Do you need more escort?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not from you. Keep going east.&quot;&nbsp; Alexander watched Attalus ride away until he was out of sight. Tolus sat beside him with his hand still on his sword.<br /><br />&quot;It is a good thing you were here.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;My General Cleitus is a smart man. He knew they would come. He kept them at court for some reason or other until I could get to you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is less the nine hours from Pella. I want to keep riding. Tell your men.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They already know, &nbsp;my prince.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Let's ride then.&quot;<br /><br /><br /></font></div></div>"

"event","<p><font size=""3"">THE EROMENOS<br /><br />CHAPTER SIX<br /></font></p><div class=""ljcut""><br /><font size=""3"">Chapter Six<br /><br />Cleitus was a strong man. He had to be. He sometimes had to be the strength behind the throne. The anchor that kept his ambitious king on the right track. Cleitus sometimes wished he could take a step back from his life. To let someone else carry his burdens for awhile. But Cleitus had never taken a step back in his life. There was only forward. After shutting the door behind Alexander, the man who would someday be king, he took a labored breath and looked at the bed. The bed that he had always considered his own. Cleitus had never cared about the Macedonian code that said older men should not be with men their own age. He and Phillip both scoffed at the idea. The code only&nbsp;benefited the men saying it for their own selfish reasons. His lover now lay sleeping in a drunken stupor beside the boy that he forced Cleitus to assault. Tonight's depravity would be the last.. Cleitus would see to that. It was the abused young man who lay beside the king that Cleitus looked to. The broken beauty&nbsp;who belonged to Alexander. Cleitus had not hurt the boy inside his body. He was young, but he was no virgin, and Cleitus had been gentle. The welts that were beginning to darken would heal and leave no marks. Even the welts that had drawn blood would heal. The slight scars would fade. Cleitus was glad for that. He didn't want Alexander seeing the scars while making love to his boy. To be reminded&nbsp;physically of this night. The wounds on a body, Cleitus could mend. The scars on the soul would take longer. Cleitus went into the king's bathroom and got warm water that was available to him and the healing salves. He then&nbsp;meticulously went about caring for the bruised body that lay beside the king.<br /><br />Hephaestion stirred at he gentle touch. He froze for a moment before he realized that the hands that cared for him were not the hands of a foe. Hephaestion didn't care about the wounds on his body, except that Alexander had seen them. He was upset that Alexander had to witness his pain. His heart was heavy. He wanted his lover.&nbsp;He ached for Alexander.<br /><br />&quot;I don't want to be here,&quot; he whispered. His voice was&nbsp;husky and, his throat hurt.<br /><br />&quot;I know lad. You can't leave yet. Don't worry. I won't let you be hurt again.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I want Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion was quiet when Cleitus wasn't more forthcoming. He knew that Alexander's pain must be almost unbearable right now. Hephaestion wished he could be with his lover. He felt so guilty. If only he had left the party early. Maybe this would not have happened. At least Alexander was assured the crown over any future child. Hephaestion was confused at some of the things that had happened that night.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus, why?&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus didn't pretend to not understand the boy. And under the circumstances he wasn't feeling very protective of his kings sensibilities. The boy deserved an answer.<br /><br />&quot;There are some people who sometimes like to inflict pain. Phillip is one. There are some people who like to have pain inflicted on them. The kings bed boy, Pausanias is one. Lately when Phillip drinks, &nbsp;that side of him comes out more and more. It's alright if both parties are into that. For Phillip when the boy is willing it is pleasurable. With you it was a betrayal. It was rape I knew he would be unable to perform. It is unfortunate about my part in this, Hephaestion. It is better to be forgotten. It doesn't mean anything. In his rage, he would have called in General Attalus. And after announcing Alexander as his heir apparent, well I wouldn't wish that on anybody.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'm not mad at you Cleitus. If it had been Attalus, he might have killed me. And I might have welcomed death. I was so afraid when Phillip tried to push into me. I couldn't have withstood the rape from my lover's father.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I might have been able to stop him without to&nbsp;many repercussions. But this might be the act that brings my lover back to me. I need to save him He will always come first for me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Like Alexander for me.&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus looked down upon the smooth tear stained face. The lashes still wet from recent tears. The boys beauty was otherworldly. So pure was his love for the prince. He was almost too good for this world.<br /><br />&quot;I am sorry I had to hurt you, boy.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's alright, Cleitus. I'll live. I'd rather it was you then the king.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; Cleitus said with humor, &quot; between you and I, he can seldom find his release with anybody but me.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion smiled at the satisfaction he could hear in Cleitus's voice.<br /><br />&quot;I think you need to straighten out your man,&quot; Hephaestion said with the same humor Cleitus had used.<br /><br />&quot;That I do, Son. That I do. Your backside is finished. Do you think you can stand? I'll help you to the bathroom, and then I'm putting you to bed in the sitting room. You don't have to fear any more, but you do have to stay there.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Please Cleitus, let me go with Alexander.&quot; Hephaestion looked up at his tormentor/savior with a beseeching look.<br /><br />&quot;He's already left, child.&quot; Cleitus said. He brushed the back of his knuckles against Hephaestion's satiny cheek. He hated the look of sorrow in the boys eyes.<br /><br />Hephaestion thought of the pain that Alexander must be going through. Fleeing in the middle of the night to save the life of his mother from the hands of his father. The same man that he was now leaving his abused lover with. The father who had betrayed him.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus, do you think Alexander will still want his father to give me to him?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He will always want you, Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I wasn't&nbsp;ever going to have been with anybody else. Only Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You're a little young to make that vow. But this won't matter to him. He loves you.&quot;<br /><br />After using the bathroom, Cleitus helped Hephaestion settle on the couch. He watched the boy lay on his side and cuddle into the warm blanket. It was warm out, but the boy must still be in a bit of shock.<br /><br />&quot;I want you to drink this,&quot; Cleitus said after returning from a trip to the bathroom. &quot;You are safe. It's just a sleeping drought. It will help you to relax.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion wrapped both hands around the cup. Much like Alexander had when he was a child. Cleitus felt nostalgia brought on by this tender person. A bit of warmth touched the heart of the hardened warrior. Cleitus smiled yet again when Hephaestion's eyes fluttered as he fought sleep.&nbsp;Again like Alexander when he was small.<br /><br />&quot;I need to go to Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Go to sleep, it will help pass the time.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He needs me. He is in pain. I can feel it. He needs me to ease his guilt. He carries such burdens.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It is good for him to carry guilt and sadness. Compassion will help make him a better king.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion couldn't answer. He had already fallen asleep.<br /><br />Cleitus stood and looked for a moment at the boy. He let his shoulders slump and he rubbed his face, before turning into the kings room. He lay down beside his lover. He would be able to sleep for a few hours before Phillip would regain consciousness. Cleitus wanted to be awake for when his crazed king awoke. He needed to be alert for the upcoming confrontation.<br /><br />Alexander and Olympia had been riding for five days. Well Alexander was riding with the guard. Olympia was seated in the carriage with her quickly assembled belongings and one frightened maid.&nbsp; Olympia had wanted Alexander to pass some time with her in the carriage. But Alexander had declined. He rode by himself. His face older then his&nbsp;years. His grief palpable. He seemed to care more about his Athenian lover then he did for his own mother. When she said as much to her son, he reminder her that she was the one in exile, Not he. He had informed her that he would see her settled and safe in Epirus and then he was going back to claim his lover. He was angry at the betrayal of his father. Olympia thought that he didn't know what betrayal was. She had lived twenty years with the man. Olympia knew that she had lost her son&nbsp;to his&nbsp;kingdom and to the beautiful man that she had seen from time to time.&nbsp;Although she hadn't lost him completely. After all he was here with her. The only thing she could do now is help insure the throne for her son. She didn't trust her vindictive husband. The insults that he reaped upon her head were unforgivable. His other marriages, that&nbsp;fortunately for her and her own son, only&nbsp;resulted in&nbsp;daughters. Now a new pregnant wife, that was due any day. In two months the kings daughter was to marry Olympia's own brother. Phillip had threatened her with divorce, death, and now she was in exile. The enormity of his sins against her were indeed unforgivable. Olympia lay her head back and let the motion of the&nbsp;carriage lull her to sleep. Her dreams were filled with vengeance and visions of the future.<br /><br />When Cleitus felt the first stirrings of Phillip, he roused himself to go wash. He asked one of the royal guard to have tea sent up. He checked on Hephaestion who looked utterly sweet curled on his side with both hands under his cheek. He then sat in a chair to await his kings rise from slumber.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus?&quot; Phillip opened one eye and quickly close it again. He rubbed his forehead and temples that held so much pain. &quot;Cleitus, come back to bed.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I wanted you to wake up so that I could tell you in person. I'm leaving, my king. I'm taking Hephaestion with me. If you try to stop us, you are going to have to kill me, Phillip.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip opened his one good eye wide.<br /><br />&quot;Cleitus! Hephaestion, why?&quot;<br /><br />Cleitus did not really have to say anything. He just had to make his threat known. No matter how drunk and crazed Phillip became from drinking, he always remembered everything. Cleitus saw the horror on the kings face when memory hit. Phillip remembered the toast of Attalus. Remembered Alexander's rage. Remembered how the young Athenian beauty clung to Alexander. His&nbsp; loyalty evident. Remembered............Oh no, Hephaestion! Remembered his threat to his sons mother..........Alexander!<br /><br />&quot;Exactly,&quot; Cleitus said. &quot;I will no longer be a party to your downfall into depravity.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip got up and wrapped a robe around his body.<br /><br />&quot;Where is the boy?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sitting room.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You can't leave me, Cleitus. I can't do all this with out you. I will make it right with the boys. I swear I will.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Quit drinking Phillip. You can't handle it. I'll stay, but in private you will do as I say. You will make it up to the boys, and to me for making me do what I will forever have nightmares about. Our son's lover, Phillip! By the gods, man, are you insane? And Phillip you will get rid of Pausanias. He has been a thorn in my side for too long now.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will, Cleitus. I can't believe I have come to this.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You are too great a man for this foolishness. I will beat you myself if you ever down slide again.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will not hurt those I love again. But I might be tempted to test your authority.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Take your bath, Phillip. We will have tea with our guest. You have some&nbsp;apologizing to do.&nbsp;And we must be ready for the return of Alexander.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /></font></div>"

"event","<font size=""3"">THE EROMENOS <br /><br />CHAPTER FIVE&nbsp;<br /></font><div class=""ljcut""><br /><font size=""3"">&quot;Stay strong, Boy,&quot; Cleitus whispered into Hephaestion's ear. He half carried, half dragged Hephaestion from the room. Away from the indignant yells of Attalus, and the taunts of the soldiers. Phillip had stopped in the corridor to talk to Pausanias. He pulled Hephaestion into the kings chambers, slamming the door behind him. <br /><br />&quot;Listen to me, Hephaestion. Are you listening? <br /><br />Hephaestion was trembling. His legs had gone numb and he could barely move from shock. He heard Cleitus through a cloud, and nodded his head. <br /><br />&quot;This is not going to be nice. He is going to hurt you.&quot; <br /><br />Hephaestion gave a little moan and rose as if he could leave the room. <br /><br />&quot;No, Boy. There's no going back now. This is not about you. It's revenge on Alexander. I know Alexander had a right to act the way he did. But Phillip is not going to see it that way right now. He's&nbsp; coming. We don't have time. Damn it. He is going to beat you. Take it. You're a warrior. He's going to need me to fuck you. I won't if you don't want, but he will call somebody else. A guard or General Attalus. &quot; <br /><br /><br />&quot;Can you believe that boy? Who does he think he is? Embarrassing me like that!&quot; Phillip staggered in to the room. He was still drunk. Reeling from the situation he found himself in. He had never wanted Alexander to lose the right to wear his crown. Attalus had pushed his will upon him and he backed himself into a corner. Alexander yelling at him, yelling at Attalus provided the opportunity he needed. He hated his first wife. Alexander was a reminder of that. Always wanting more. <br /><br />&quot;Phillip, I think we should think about this. I think drink is impairing your judgement. I.....&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Quiet! I'm still king am I not? I still rule here Cleitus, not you.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Yes, Sire.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Get over here, Boy.&quot; <br /><br />Hephaestion backed up a step involuntarily. <br /><br />&quot;It'll be worse for you, if you don't get over here right now. Cleitus will not save you.&quot; <br /><br />Cleitus pushed Hephaestion over to the king, who then pushed him to the floor. <br /><br />&quot;You want your Alexander to come in and save you, don't you? Don't you?&quot; Phillip backhanded Hephaestion. Hard enough to make his head reel for a moment. <br /><br />&quot;He's not going to save you. He made his choice. You weren't it, you little foreign brat. Do you know how much trouble the Athenians are giving me? Even now they try to rise up against me. Your honorable father who accepted my money. What did I get?&quot; <br /><br />Phillip then ripped the clothes from Hephaestion's body, leaving the young man trembling naked on the floor. He opened his robe and tried to push Hephaestion's face against his soft phallus. <br /><br />&quot;Make me hard. Do for me what you do for my son. I hear your screams at night when we are in our sitting room. You're a loud little thing. Well, fill your mouth. I paid good money for you.&quot; <br /><br />Hephaestion turned his face away and whimpered a little. He couldn't do it. <br /><br />Phillip backhanded him again, grabbing the back of his head. Before he could do anything more,&nbsp;there was a commotion at the door. Alexander's voice and that of the guards. <br /><br />&quot;You'll not have him, Alexander! You have your crown!&quot; Phillip yelled. &quot;Listen to his screams!&quot; <br /><br />Hephaestion tried to crawl away, he needed to get to Alexander. His head hurt, and he couldn't quite remember why he was there. <br /><br />Phillip forcefully picked him up and threw him onto the bed. He grabbed up some oil and roughly pushed it into Hephaestion's opening. He was told not to move. <br /><br />At least he was going to get it over with, Hephaestion thought. No sooner was the thought finished when he felt the red hot pain upon his buttocks. He screamed from pained surprise. And another blow hit. Hephaestion tried not to cry. He wanted to stay strong. Blow after blow hit his thighs and bruised his bottom. He saw Phillip raising the thick leather strap, he was too tired to cry out when the blow hit, he just gave another whimper. <br /><br />&quot;I want guards sent to that shrews room tomorrow morning. I'm not waiting to divorce her. I'm having her killed tomorrow. I'll kill her myself! Who here would blame me except her son. He'll have my crown. He'll dare not say anything. Give the order, Cleitus.&quot; Phillip raised his hand for yet another hit when Cleitus grabbed the kings arm. <br /><br />&quot;He's had enough, Phillip. <br /><br />Phillip went in behind Hephaestion and raised his ass in the air, he then went to push into the boys body with his semi hard erection. <br /><br />&quot;You're going to have to fuck him, Cleitus.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Sire, you don't want to do this. He's a good...I don't want to...&quot; <br /><br />&quot;If you have a problem with this, Get out! Send in Attalus. I've seen him ogle the boy enough.&quot; <br /><br />Hephaestion gave a mournful cry. <br /><br />&quot;May the Gods damn you for this, Phillip!&quot; <br /><br />Cleitus felt sickened at what he was forced to do. He untied his robe and slid into the young man in one long stroke. Hephaestion cried out from the assault. Cleitus knew the king wouldn't let him go easy. He buried himself again and again. He was angry at himself for being able to get hard in this dreadful situation. He was always able to get hard when ever the king wanted. <br /><br />&quot;Make him come, Cleitus,&quot; Phillip groaned. He grew excited watching Cleitus fuck the boy. He would be jealous for weeks afterward. But in his drunkenness he wasn't thinking of that. <br /><br />Cleitus leaned down over Hephaestion's back to whisper into Hephaestion's ear. <br /><br />&quot;Let yourself go, Hephaestion. It's just stimulation. It doesn't mean anything. Just let yourself feel it. It will all be over soon.&quot; <br /><br />Cleitus reached around to stroke Hephaestion's hardening member, angling his cock to touch the boys secret spot with every deep stroke. Hephaestion reluctantly came into the generals hand and collapsed on the bed. <br /><br />Cleitus pulled out without coming and grabbed his king, wiping the boys seed down the front of the kings tunic.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Is this what you wanted? Rape?&quot; He pushed Phillip onto the bed and pushed into him without washing himself or preparing the king. He slammed into the drunken man over and over. PHillip came with a shout, screaming out his pleasure so that Alexander would hear. Cleitus pulled out yet again. He threw a cover up over the kings ass. <br /><br />&quot;I'm going to have to spend myself on your ass, Hephaestion. I'm sorry.&quot; Cleitus quickly got himself off and stood up to clean himself. <br /><br />&quot;Stay still, Hephaestion. One more ordeal. I'll get you through this.&quot; <br /><br />Cleitus ran his fingers through some blood that had formed from one of the welts. He rubbed the blood around the cleft of Hephaestion's body. He then took a labored breath and went to the door. He prepared himself to see the devastated boy on the other side of the door. <br /><br />Alexander had followed Cleitus and Hephaestion. He didn't know what he could do, but he figured if he could just talk to his father away from the eyes of the court. The guards stopped him, so circled around another way, only to be stopped at the door. They wouldn't let him enter. He sat down on the floor opposite of the kings door. He had to chose as he did. The way his father drank and fought, he could be dead anytime. Attalus would rule in any baby's stead. He would rule Alexander's people. Alexander's kingdom. How could he let that happen? He heard the sounds of the strap. When he heard the screams of his lover he put his head on his knees and wept. He only raised his head when he heard the door open. He raised his eyes to see Cleitus beckon him in, with a finger to his lips. <br /><br />Alexander started to go to his lover, when Cleitus grabbed his arm. <br /><br />&quot;Not now, son. Phillip is going to have your mother killed tomorrow morning. Get her and ride to Epirus tonight. I'll send word when it is safe to return.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion can't ride.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;He's not going. He isn't yours any longer. Say your good-bye and leave now. He has said it. I think it will be done if she is here.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I'm not going without Hephaestion!&quot; <br /><br />Cleitus looked at the boy who had been like a son to him. Old enough to lead an army, still a child looking to Cleitus for an answer. Hurting and wanting the pain to go away. <br /><br />&quot;You can't take him, Alexander. I'll care for him.&quot; <br /><br />Alexander slowly went over to his broken lover. The welts were already turning black and blue.Some had blood on them. He grimaced when he saw the evidence of semen and blood on his ass. He looked over to the drunken passed out man on the other side of the bed. He wanted to kill him. Hephaestion moaned. <br /><br />Alexander knelt on the floor next to his lovers face. Hephaestion reached his hand out and placed it on Alexanders. Such a simple gesture of love brought tears to the prince's eyes. He kissed Hephaestion's eye lids. Licking his tears. <br /><br />&quot;I'm so sorry, Phai'. I love you. I'm so sorry.&quot; <br /><br />Hephaestion squeezed Alexander's arm. Alexander could tell by his breathing that he fell into a fitful sleep. <br /><br />&quot;I want to take care of his wounds.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I'll do it. You need to go now, Alexander. I'll take care of him, boy. Have I ever lied to you? Get your mother out of here. He'll wake anytime. Leave now or it will be worse for him.&quot; <br /><br />With a last look at his lover, Alexander went out the door. <br /></font></div>"

CHAPTER FOUR</font>

<div class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"">&quot;Did you get a good look at her?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she is very pretty, your mother. I think she knew&nbsp;I was there. At one point she looked straight at where I was hiding.&quot;

&quot;It was dark where you were, Hephaestion. She couldn&#39;t know who was there anyway. She most likely thought that you were a servant.&quot;

Hephaestion had already started drawing,&nbsp; while the image of Olympia was fresh in his mind. He would shadow her face a little anyway. Make her beautiful. Women liked that. Well, she was beautiful, but Hephaestion saw a hardness in her that detracted from her beauty. They had arrived earlier that day, his own friends declining the visit to Alexander&#39;s home. Hephaestion didn&#39;t blame them. Their fates were not as fortunate as Hephaestion&#39;s own. They dare not associate with the other youth of Macedonia. They did not know their destiny as Hephaestion did. Hephaestion would stand at the side of the prince and future king. Alexander&#39;s love had saved him, and Hephaestion would forever be in his dept. 

Upon arriving in Pella, Alexander sought his mother out, asking her to meet him in the Royal garden. It was late evening. Past dusk. The garden was lit by a hundred candles, casting a glow upon the late summer blooms. Olympia and Alexander had talked, holding hands and sitting on an ornate bench with&nbsp;hibiscus all around them. It would be a picture that Hephaestion could do justice to. He had hid in the bushes, doing rough sketches of the queen. He did not need to look at Alexander. His lover, he knew by heart. Alexander was right about the snake. She had brought one with her. Strange women, he thought.

&quot;That looks nice, Hephaestion. You make her look gentler then she is.&quot;

&quot;She may be a hard women, Alexander. But for a short time when she looked at you, she had the gentle look of a mother who loves her son. That is what I draw.&quot;

&quot;You only ever see the good in people, my sweet Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;There is good in everybody, Alexander. You just have to look.&quot;

&quot;We will make a formidable team in life, beloved. Between us we will always see the two faces of man.&quot; Alexander rubbed Hephaestion&#39;s&nbsp; back, careful not to touch the arm he was drawing with.

&quot;I can not concentrate when you touch me, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tease me. Because it makes me want you to touch me in other places. Ale stop. Let me finish this. Please.&quot;

&quot;Alright, Phai. I can&#39;t wait to give this to her. I know she will love it. When I tell people that you are the artist, you will have people clamoring for your work.&quot;

&quot;I have never thought of selling my work. It&#39;s just something I do. Maybe I can make enough to buy my freedom from your father. I can travel all over drawing and painting famous kings and their families.&quot;

Alexander stood abruptly. Trembling at the sudden fear that enveloped his body.

&quot;Is that what you want? Freedom so you can travel?&quot;

Hephaestion looked up from his drawing, confused at Alexander&#39;s sudden anger. He had to think for a moment of what he had said to cause Alexander this distress.

&quot;I want to travel with you, Alexander. Yours is the only face I ever want to draw. When you are king. There will be no other worthy of my drawing fingers. Why do you always doubt my love?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t. Except when you say the things you do, it makes me nervous that I can&#39;t give you what you need.&quot;

Hephaestion went back to his drawing. Olympia was almost done. Alexander&#39;s expressive face, he could draw in his sleep.

&quot;You give me all that I&#39;ll ever need, Alexander. You have promised me my freedom. And you love me. For that I am yours forever. How does that look?&quot; He asked, holding up the drawing. He had entwined their hands, making it look as if the snake was crawling down Olympia&#39;s arm to crawl onto Alexander. Joining them. The two looked beautiful together. Mother and son.&nbsp; Hephaestion thought that the snake gave it an eerie effect, but Alexander assured him that she would love it because of that reason.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I won&#39;t have time to add color, but you can tell your mother that we can add it later, or even commission me for another picture.&quot;

&quot;This will be fine, Hephaestion. Besides your prince has already commissioned you for more pictures. I want a couple of you and I together. I want a few of you alone. Your face, your body.&quot;

&quot;Alexander,&quot; Hephaestion interrupted, &quot;how am I supposed to do that?&quot;

&quot;Look into a mirror. I am serious, Hephaestion. I want pictures of you.&quot; Alexander lowered his voice. Husky with a need that he knew Hephaestion couldn&#39;t resist. &quot;I want a picture of you after we have made love.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you need to get another artist to do a picture like that of me.&quot;

&quot;No! I want no other to see you that way. You look too beautiful for anybody to see you that way.&quot;

&quot;What way?&quot; Hephaestion whispered. &quot;How do I look?&quot;

&quot;You look sated. You skin has a rosy glow. Your&nbsp;magnificent eyes look like crystal, they are glassy and reflect the light of the candle, moon or of the sun. They shine with a brightness that would blind most men. Your sweet lips are always swollen from my kisses or from you tasting my&nbsp;desire for you. Your face is moist from passion, and your hair is in disarray. You look like you have been ravished, and I never want anyone else to see that beauty. It is for my eyes alone.&quot;

Alexander could seduce Hephaestion with his words as well as with his body, and Hephaestion was quivering from suppressed desire by the time that Alexander finished talking.

&quot;I love that you find me desirable. Please Alexander, I need you now.&quot;

&quot;You are so sexual.You always want it.&quot;

&quot;And you want me like that. Now Alexander.&quot;

&quot;So bossy.&quot;

Alexander undressed his lover, pealing him, layer by layer until he lay naked before him. A visual feast. He didn&#39;t undress himself right away. Hephaestion liked the feel of a clothed Alexander&nbsp;against his naked skin. He teased himself with it until all he needed was to feel Alexanders skin.

Alexander didn&#39;t play tonight. He got right to it. He poured oil over his fingers and inserted two into Hephaestion&#39;s opening. He watched his fingers go in and out of his writhing lover. Watched Hephaestion push onto his questing fingers.

&quot;Now Alexander. Oh Gods, please now.&quot;

Alexander stood and undressed, wiping the oil on to his clothes.&nbsp;Hephaestion lay panting on the bed. His nerve endings were on fire. His hole was&nbsp;spasming. He was ready to explode with need.

&quot;I want to ride you, Alexander.&quot;

Alexander lay down and Hephaestion wasted no time in throwing a leg over him and lowering himself onto Alexander&#39;s cock. They both moaned at the feeling of insertion. Finally. Finally, they both thought. Needing to fill and be filled. Hephaestion leaned into Alexander. His own&nbsp;phallus he rubbed upon Alexander&#39;s stomach, and he rocked back and forth upon Alexander&#39;s cock. He made sure he swiveled his hips so that his prostate was touched with each rocking motion.

Alexander grabbed Hephaestion&#39;s hips, guiding him. He bucked up hard into his panting&nbsp;lover, making him cry out and sob his pleasure. Alexander searched for his lips, sucking them until they were full and swollen, just like he liked them. It wasn&#39;t long before the two young lovers were both crying out each others names. Their completion came with in moments of each other. Hephaestion collapsed onto Alexander&#39;s body. The prince holding him tight in his arms. He was still impaled on Alexanders cock and he knew that if he stayed that way , Alexander being young and in love would be ready to go again. This time he would seek control and use Hephaestion&#39;s body hard. He squeezed his anus a couple times, satisfied when he could feel Alexander hardening within his still tender body. Crying out when Alexander suddenly rolled him upon his back and grabbed his legs in the air.

&quot;Is this what you want, my little slut? You want me to fuck you hard?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Do it.&quot; Hephaestion screamed when Alexander with one hard thrust impaled him self into Hephaestion.

&quot;Gods yes you feel so good,&quot; Alexander moaned, picking up pace and fucking his lover hard. Sometimes they liked it soft and loving, but there were times that Hephaestion needed to be possessed as much as Alexander wanted to prove his ownership over Hephaestion&#39;s pleasure.

In a sitting room next door sat the king and his long time lover.

&quot;By the gods, Phillip, they are at it again.&quot; Cleitus said good natured. 

&quot;It&#39;s a good thing&nbsp;I gave him up. That young Athenian would have killed&nbsp;me in his lust.&quot;

&quot;I think his lust is for your son. They remind me of us twenty years ago.&quot;

&quot;They remind me of us now. That is when you let me take you like that, which these days are getting harder and harder to convince you.&quot;

&quot;We are getting older and.....&quot;

&quot;Oh bah, if your king does not care, then why should you?&nbsp; I want you, Cleitus. I want you to take me tonight. It has been too long.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go to our rooms. I don&#39;t want your son to hear his father getting fucked.&quot;

&quot;It might give them some ideas. I bet he hasn&#39;t let young Hephaestion take him yet.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll not let him get his ideas through us.&quot;

&quot;My beloved Cleitus, still watching out for me after all these years.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s getting harder. You and your young lovers. I have to keep my eye on them now too.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t mean anything. You know that Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;Come on. I have a need to show you who you really belong to, my king.&quot;


It was only Alexander who had dinner with his mother on the evening of her birthday. His married sister was unable to travel due to pregnancy. The king made a token appearance at the private dinner and left the two alone.

&quot;So my son, who is this boy I hear so much about? This boy who has stolen your affection away from me?&quot;

&quot;He has stolen nothing, Mother. I still feel the same for you.&quot;

&quot;Last year when you came home from school you spent all day with me. You spent all weekend with this boy. The men&#39;s party to celebrate the queens birthday is not until tonight. You could have spared me a few more hours. I only gave birth to you.&quot;

&quot;Mother do not begrudge me this happiness. He means you no harm.&quot;

&quot;Is he Hephaestion Amnitor. The same Hephaestion Amnitor who&#39;s name is at the bottom of my birthday picture?

&quot;Yes. He drew the picture for you.&quot;

&quot;He is very good. He is the same boy your father bought to be his eromenos, is he not?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Mother, I do not know how you find out these things. Regardless, do not harm him. I warn you.&quot;

&quot;You warn me? It is your father you need to worry about. He won&#39;t give up the boy easily.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t cause trouble, Mother.&quot;

&quot;What can a mere woman do? Thank him for the picture, Alexander. Your fathers excuse for a party will begin soon. Will you see me before you go back to Meiza?&quot;

&quot;We can breakfast tomorrow morning. Would you like to meet Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;When he is a free man I will meet him. I bid you good night, my love.&quot;

&quot;Good health, Mother.&quot;

The party turned out to be just another drinking party for which Phillip&#39;s court was becoming famous. Alexander&#39;s friends enjoyed themselves. Phillip always had plenty of wine, women and boys. For the first time the students from meiza were considered old enough to partake. As for Alexander and Hephaestion, they sat on the prince&#39;s couch together. Their bodies close but not touching. They watched Phillip become drunk. He groped his current eramenos and then the two watched as Phillip passed the boy off to another,&nbsp;unmindful of the boys cries. Alexander, ever protective of Hephaestion decided to get his lover out of there. He didn&#39;t want to admit it, but he was scared of his father in his current condition.

&quot;Where are you going, boy? That&#39;s my property that your running off with.&quot;

&quot;Father, don&#39;t do this.&quot;

&quot;Do what? What is the king doing that a prince would find fault with? I just want to know my son&#39;s lover better. Come here, Hephaestion.&quot;

Alexander stepped in front of his lover. Stopping him from moving.

&quot;I am the king, boy. You dare disobey me!&quot;

Alexander cast a pleading look to Cleitus, begging him to interfere. Cleitus, loving the boy as his own stood behind the king and rubbed his hands over his lovers chest, slightly pressing his body against Phillips. Phillip recognizing his lovers touch, turned around. He loved claiming Cleitus in public. Loved having the world know that he still owned this strong warrior after all these years. Alexander gave Cleitus a look of intense gratitude, grabbed Hephaestion&#39;s hand and fled the room. 

&quot;I want to leave here tonight. Let&#39;s get our things. Hurry Hephaestion.&quot;

Hephaestion didn&#39;t say anything. The experience frightened him. he would have to be alert to dangers in the future and leave the room when danger showed his face. He couldn&#39;t expect Alexander to go up against his father at every turn.

Ptolemy and Cassander met them at the stables. They all rode back that very night, the Prince&#39;s friends worried about Hephaestion. They knew that the boy was key to their future kings happiness.

The last school year passed without incident to Hephaestion. The buyers of his friends had heard about the involvement between Alexander and Hephaestion and grew scared about their virgin investments. They demanded the boys to be given to them right away, which Phillip granted their wish. Kortos and Heinex were to be brought to the kings own brother and son in law.. Peitos was bought by a long time friend of the king. A rich man who had no family. Domine was bought by Cassander&#39;s father, Antipater. Hephaestion was sad to see them go. Sad because as it turned out, they were not bought for any intelligence they could bring to the kings forces. They were bought for their looks. It was no worse then the slavers who terrorized their homeland in search of pretty boys.

&quot;Is that what I am, Alexander? Just a face to beautify the kings palace?&quot;

&quot;You think highly of yourself, my love.&quot;

&quot;Alexander. I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just that I feel bad for my friends.&quot;

&quot;I do too. I wish it could be different. But the truth is Hephaestion, they were the spoils of war. It might have been wrapped up to sound different. Your friends knew that, even more then you. They saved their families. Their sisters and brothers will have opportunities. I&#39;m sorry. You will see, when we go to war that many youths will become servants, and slaves, or forced to join our armies. We will try to make their life better. Try to give them something to fight for. Fact is not always pretty. I wish I could protect you from this.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need you to protect me from unpleasant things, Alexander. I am every bit as strong as you.&quot;

&quot;I know. I am still sorry for your friends.&quot;

&quot;I just wish I knew what was in store for me. I wish your father would give me to you and get it over with. He did for the buyers of my friends. I feel like he plays with us. I have no power.&quot;

Alexander wanted to give his lover some sort of power over his own life. He was afraid of Hephaestion&#39;s independence, but that didn&#39;t mean he couldn&#39;t feel his lovers pain. He wrapped his arms around Hephaestion&#39;s&nbsp;shoulders and buried his face in the hollow of his neck.

&quot;Will you make love to me Phai&#39;?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I need you to make love to me this time. I want to give myself to you.&quot;

&quot;You are the prince, you never want that.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes I want it. I just feel uncomfortable asking.&quot;

&quot;Ale&#39; you never have to be worried about asking anything of me. I live to please you. You know that.&quot;

&quot;Then make love to me. I have never been with a man in that way, so please, my love, go slow.&quot;

Hephaestion remembered the sweet way that Alexander had taken his virginity. He slowly undressed himself and then his lover. He was almost trembling with anticipation of being inside his beloved. He didn&#39;t think he would ever be given this gift, and he was afraid to ask Alexander for fear of rejection. He noticed Alexander&#39;s own trembling. Remembering again his first time, he leaned in to kiss Alexander, whispering, &quot;I love you.&quot;


Another year had gone by and Alexander and Hephaestion had been living at the palace for ten months. Phillip himself was gone most of the time trying to force relations with the Byzantines. He took Alexander and Hephaestion with him at times and let them sit in on any talks. War was in the future. He even used Hephaestion&#39;s skills as an interpreter when talking to emissary&#39;s from Thebes, Persia and even traders from far away Gaul. Alexander was left in charge of the rule of Macedonia while Phillip was away. Phillip had too many of his own problems to worry about his son and his lover. He hated his shrew of a wife and wanted to marry again. He had even gotten the girl pregnant. Cleitus was pulling away from him&nbsp; and he had little sleep, worrying about everything.

There was to be a grand party that night to celebrate the upcoming wedding. The girls father and uncle were there. Phillip had been drinking heavily. The room was divided between the friends and soldiers of the king, who with him included his new in laws, and the friends and companions of Prince Alexander. Hephaestion wished he wasn&#39;t there, but like his other friends he had to be there for Alexander. Hephaestion roused himself to listen. He heard bits of a conversation.

&quot;.....and may he produce a rightful heir to the throne.&quot;

Alexander stood with his friends.

&quot;You let him talk of my mother like that. I am your heir!&quot;

&quot;Be&nbsp;quiet boy! I&#39;ll leave my crown to who I want, and there is nothing you or your bitch of a mother can do about it. Get out! Get out of my sight!&quot;

&quot;This is the man who would lead you to Persia?&quot;

Hephaestion stood with the others trying to hold Alexander back, hating the grins and laughter from Phillips new in laws, wanting nothing more then to hurt them for Alexander. It was then that Phillip noticed the boy that he had been coveting for years. The boy he owned. He didn&#39;t want to take away the crown from Alexander, but he had been backed into a corner.

&quot;You think you are my rightful heir? Well choose boy! The heir to the throne officially announced right now or this slave boy to whom you are so devoted!&quot;

Cleitus had seen the movement from the king for him to hold and take Hephaestion. It was a direct order. Better he then another guard.

Hephaestion looked at Alexander in horror. Cleitus was already taking him, knowing what Alexander would say. He was whispering in his ear to be strong. But the roaring in his head wouldn&#39;t allow him to hear. He could see Phillip&#39;s lecherous face, and his body was seized by dread. He remembered the things he had seen Phillip do to boys. He was trembling in terror.

&quot;Choose, boy! The crown or the whore.&quot;

Hephaestion could feel Cleitus holding him up. His legs had gone numb. He knew Alexander had to choose his people, his rightful crown, but he was clinging to Alexander to save him as he always did.

With an anguished look at Hephaestion, Alexander looked to his father.

&quot;May Zeus damn you for eternity, old man! &nbsp;I chose the crown.&quot;

Alexander closed his eyes. Not wanting to watch Phillip and Cleitus carry Hephaestion from the room. He wished he could close his ears to his lovers horrified screams. 

&quot;Alexander! No, please. Alexander!&quot;</font></div>"

CHAPTER&nbsp;THREE</font>
<div class=""ljcut"">
<font size=""3"">Dinner was a festive affair that evening. The teachers sat at their own tables at the end of the hall. Windows and doors were open to let the evening air cool the occupants. Hephaestion didn&#39;t always sit with Alexander, but that evening he did. He could tell the prince was excited about something. He hoped it was good news for them. Hephaestion did not hold out for true emancipation, but he could always dream. His friends from Athens didn&#39;t seem to be as upset as Hephaestion was about their predicament. Maybe they were happy to get away from their families. So was Hephaestion for that matter. He wished he could be like Alexander&#39;s friends. Free young men, ready to take on the world. That should have been the life for him too. If his father had just held out. He would have offered his skills to King Phillip without being indentured to some rich man. Right now, Alexander seemed to be his only hope. 

Alexander put his hand under the table to&nbsp;surreptitiously run the back of his fingers down Hephaestion&#39;s thigh.

&quot;You are not eating, Phai. Do you want my apple?

&quot;No Alexander, you need to eat more fruit yourself. Why does there always have to be so much meat?

&quot;Shh, the boys of Macedon will be angry if they hear you,&quot; Alexander giggled. Hephaestion was funny in his ways sometimes, But Alexander loved him all the more for it. &quot;Lets go to our room. I have much to tell you.&quot;

The two boys got up to leave. Alexander was staring at Hephaestion&#39;s backside, but he wasn&#39;t to preoccupied to nab Ptolemys apple that he had put aside. Ptolemy didn&#39;t like them, and Hephaestion might be grateful later.

&quot;Your father bought me? My fathers sworn enemy. But why? Did he say?&quot; They had just sat down on Alexander&#39;s bed and Hephaestion was told the news.

&quot;He wanted to give your father a final blow. I am sorry, Hephaestion. My father is a man of war, and your father fought him all the way.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t blame your father for that. I just don&#39;t believe it. He paid an&nbsp;exorbitant amount for me. Alexander, you know more. What is it?&quot;

&quot;He saw you. By God Hephaestion, it seems even my father is not immune to your charms. He thought you were incredibly beautiful and he wanted you.&quot;

Hephaestion put his hands over his face. He started to tremble.

&quot;Oh Ale&#39; not your own father. I can&#39;t lay with my own love&#39;s father.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, that is my best news. I told father that we were in love and asked him to gift you to me. Hephaestion, he agreed. He said yes.&quot;

&quot;So I will belong to you.?&quot;

&quot;You already belong to me.&quot;

&quot;My heart belongs to you. My soul belongs to you. My body is yours to desire. You own me in so many ways. But I do not want to be your property. When will he gift me to you?&quot;

&quot;Not until you are eighteen. He says it is the law.&quot;

&quot;He could do it now. He&nbsp;*is* &nbsp;the law. What is to stop him from changing his mind? He could take me any time he wants to, and there is nothing we can do about it.&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t. He will be honorable to the pledge he gave me.&quot;

&quot;What did you agree to, Alexander?&quot;

&quot;I just told him I would be a good son. Honor him. Maybe take his side against Mother sometimes. He did not ask for much.&quot; He has been in love with Cleitus for twenty years. He respects true love.&quot;

&quot;Cleitus? The man who came with him today?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Cleitus has been like a second father to me, they are so close. He is several years younger then my father. I don&#39;t remember a time when they haven&#39;t been together. He was mad at my father for buying you.&quot;

&quot;He is very handsome. I wonder why your father would desire me, when he has Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;Because you are young and pretty, and he is old.&quot;

&quot;He can&#39;t be much more then thirty. You will still love me when we are thirty, won&#39;t you Alexander?&quot;

&quot;I will love you my entire life. I just don&#39;t like you thinking my fathers lover is handsome.&quot;

&quot;You are jealous. Ale&#39;s jealous.&quot;

&quot;Stop it. I am not.&quot;

&quot;Good, because how could the person who owns my soul be jealous of the person who has just my passing thought.&quot;

&quot;I love you, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;I love you. I wish My father had given me some money. I would like to buy you a gift sometime.&quot;

&quot;You are all the gift I will ever need.&quot; Alexander said, reminding himself to buy Hephaestion a gift. He had never thought of that. But, he would like to give his lover things. To see his joy.

&quot;Not for three more years.&quot;

&quot;You are my gift now. A gift from Zeus himself. Any other gift will always pale in comparison to my most valued treasure. And speaking of gifts, it is my mothers birthday in two weeks. My father told me to invite all my friends. I would like you to go, Hephaestion. My father said it is alright, as long as we keep things private.&quot;

&quot;I would like to see your home. My friends, are they invited.?&quot;

&quot;You all are.&quot;

&quot;Do we bring her anything?&quot;

&quot;No, but I need to figure out a gift to give her. She has everything, and she is never satisfied.&quot;

&quot;What does she like?&quot;

&quot;Snakes. She likes snakes.&quot;

&quot;How about a picture. A picture of you and your mother and a snake.&quot;

&quot;How am I going to get that. I know of no artists in Macedon.&quot;

&quot;I can draw quite well. And if I have time I can mix colors and paint it. I will somehow need to see your mother before hand.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, it&#39;s too much. It would be a gift from you. Not myself.&quot;

&quot;Then pay me. Commission me to paint your mothers picture with her beloved son.&quot;

&quot;I keep finding things out about you. You speak a million languages. Now you are an artist.&quot;

&quot;I have sketches here that I have done. Do you want to see?&quot;

&quot;Very much.&quot; Alexander watched Hephaestion bend over his trunk in order to search for sketch tablets. He nearly moaned when he saw Hephaestion&#39;s bottom. He wanted the other boy so badly. He was sick with love for him. He didn&#39;t want to rush his friend, but he wanted more then kisses and sucking each others cock. Although Hephaestion had not only gotten really good at it, he seemed to love it too. 

&quot;Here&#39;s one.&quot;

Alexander dutifully opened the book and got a huge surprise. Hephaestion <i>was</i> a true artist. There were a few pictures of a group of people he assumed were Hephaestion&#39;s family. One picture Hephaestion even put himself in the picture. He was standing with his arms outstretched, reaching&nbsp;towards his family, who had their backs turned to him. It was a sad picture. There was one of Alexander and Cassander kicking a ball. There was a picture of Domine looking at the sky as if held all the secrets. Alexander turned the page, and saw himself staring back. It was Alexander looking at Hephaestion in the mirror. It was very beautiful. There was one more picture. It was Alexander again. Naked, laying in the grass beside the lake. His body looked strong and muscled. His head was tipped back a little bit, and his lips parted. It was an erotic picture.

&quot;You have made me look so beautiful.&quot;

&quot;You are beautiful, Alexander. I draw what I see.&quot;

&quot;I want you to draw yourself like this. And different ways also. I want pictures of you. I will pay you.&quot;

&quot;Buy my paper, and my quills, and that is all. That can be my gift to you. Why would you want pictures of me?&quot;

&quot;Because I hate when you are out of my sight. This way I can always see you.&quot;

&quot;I hope we are always together. Alexander, &nbsp;when your father gifts me to you,&nbsp; you are going to free me, right?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s allowed.&quot; Alexander felt guilty. He would value his own freedom. But would Hephaestion suddenly pull away from him if he was allowed his. He liked Hephaestion&#39;s dependency. &quot;Would it be so bad for you if it&#39;s not allowed? It wouldn&#39;t make to much of a difference.&quot;

&quot;It would to me Alexander. I don&#39;t want your friends to mock me for being a slave. I am smart, and I can help you when you are king. I want to journey the world at your side. I want to be worthy of you. I want to be your equal. If it is allowed, you are going to free me aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I will free you.&quot; Alexander was suddenly chilled. He was scared of his emotions. What if Hephaestion were to leave him if Alexander made him mad. What would make him stay if he were free to go. He was scared that he had lied to his lover. Maybe he could tell him that it was not allowed. He knew that Hephaestion was his equal. But if Hephaestion belonged to Alexander it would keep others from thinking they might have a chance with his lover. He wished Hephaestion had never brought up that question.

&quot;I will love you forever, Alexander. In freeing me I will always belong to you. Thank you, my prince. You have loved me, and fought to save me. No man could ever ask for more.&quot;

Alexander leaned in to kiss Hephaestion. He wanted more. Needed more.

&quot;Let me make love to you tonight. I will make it so good for us.&quot;

&quot;Mm, yes.&quot;

Alexander stood up before Hephaestion and stripped himself. He loved seeing Hephaestion&#39;s eyes go wide. The first time he had seen Alexanders cock, it scared him a little. Now he was so ready for it. Alexander lifted the chiton over Hephaestion&#39;s head. He was naked underneath. They had both gone to the public bath before supper.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Alexander said upon seeing his lovers naked body. He kissed Hephaestion on his open lips, sliding his tongue inside, tasting him,&nbsp;inhaling him, becoming apart of him. &quot;I love you,&quot; Alexander said, when he kissed Hephaestion&#39;s neck, sucking a little on the sensitive flesh. Earlier that week, Alexander had witnessed two slaves making love in the stables. He called it making love, because that&#39;s what it was. What he had seen, he wanted to try with Hephaestion. He gently pushed Hephaestion so that he would roll over and lay on his stomach. &quot;I love you,&quot; Alexander said as he kissed his lovers back. Sliding his tongue over his warmed skin. He touched Hephaestion&#39;s bottom, squeezing the small muscled cheeks, opening them to gaze for the first time on the opening of Hephaestion&#39;s body. The opening that soon would become the link to make the two become one forever. &quot;I love you,&quot; Alexander said, as he put his tongue to the portal, holding Hephaestion down when he threatened to jump off the bed. He licked his lover, knowing he would never do this to any other man. Only Hephaestion. Always Hephaestion. He oiled his erection, ready to be inside his lover. But he wanted Hephaestion to be ready for him. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said as he slid his finger inside his lover, soon adding another. Hephaestion was moaning and crying out. Alexander loved the sound, wanting nothing more then to make his lover cry out his pleasure. Hephaestion&#39;s lust filled voice only spurred Alexander on. He licked back up Hephaestion&#39;s back, sucking once more on his neck. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said once more,&nbsp; pushing his cock into Hephaestion&#39;s passage. So tight. So wet and hot. Alexander stopped for a moment, for himself as well as for Hephaestion. The&nbsp;pleasure was almost to much. To good. He almost exploded from just entering his lover. He started to move, upset because he didn&#39;t think he would last long. He buried his face in Hephaestion&#39;s hair,&nbsp;&nbsp;inhaling his scent, concentrating on the pure enjoyment of being inside his&nbsp; soulmate. He reached under Hephaestion to touch his leaking member, to bring Hephaestion to&nbsp;fulfillment. He wanted to bring Hephaestion to completion without touching him, but he was afraid he wouldn&#39;t last. Hephaestion came into his hand, crying out Alexander&#39;s name. The pulsing&nbsp;vice on Alexanders cock brought him to his own completion. &quot;I love you,&quot; he cried, pumping his juices into his lover, to finally lay spent. His weight on his lovers back. He rolled off and Hephaestion buried himself in Alexander&#39;s arms.

Hephaestion wrapped his arms around Alexanders shoulders, throwing a leg over his hip. He thrust his face into Alexanders neck, breathing in his scent. He trembled from the aftermath of his first time. So happy it was Alexander. Happy that Alexander was holding him tightly, knowing it was what Hephaestion needed. Finally Hephaestion looked up at his lover, his blue eyes beautiful, and his lashes wet with tears. &quot;I love you, Alexander.&quot;

Alexander smiled a joyous smile. Looking upon this man made him feel great. As if nobody else ever got to gaze upon such beauty. He felt god-like from Hephaestion&#39;s love.

&quot;Ale&#39;, I wish I could kiss you and see you when we make love.&quot;

&quot;We can do it from the front.&quot; &nbsp;Alexander laughed, holding Hephaestion tighter to him.. He felt so much more experienced then his lover. It made him feel good that he was the only one Hephaestion would ever know. &quot;There are all kinds of ways for us to make love.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, can we do it again?&quot;

Alexander grinned. He could surely last longer a second time.</font>

"event","<p><font size=""3"">THE EROMENOS<br /><br />CHAPTER TWO<br /></font></p><div class=""ljcut""><br /><font size=""3"">Alexander woke early. The sun had not yet come up. The&nbsp;night sky&nbsp;bathed his and Hephaestion's room in moonlit glow. Alexander could hear the pre-dawn birds that told of the time.&nbsp;The school would be waking soon. Alexander looked over to the next bed. The moon beam seamed to fall directly onto Hephaestion, who was laying on his back. The light sheet, that was all they needed in the late summer heat, was low on his hips. One tanned leg was outside of the thin cover. Alexander longed to run his hand over the leg, to touch the toned thigh. He wanted to run his hand over Hephaestion's hip, and up over his smooth chest.<br /><br />Alexander licked his fingers and touched his nipples. He imagined they were Hephaestion's nipples growing hard from his touch. He imagined leaning over and kissing the full pink lips, that in profile, looked so full, so inviting. He lowered his hand to touch his cock, running his wet fingers over the tip. How he would love to touch Hephaestion's cock. The other boy had probably never had another touch him there&nbsp; Alexander imagined the lust and innocence in Hephaestions eyes, his cock hardening from another's touch for the very first time. Alexander's touch.<br /><br />Alexander was young and it didn't take him long. He came quickly into his hand, whispering Hephaestion's name. When he again opened his eyes, fevered blue ones were staring back at him.<br /><br />&quot;That was so beautiful. I have never seen.....I have never.....Oh Alexander. Does it feel good?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;When you touch yourself. What is it like?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion, haven't you ever touched yourself?&quot; Alexander was astounded. He and the other boys had touched themselves for years. Many of them touching each other.<br /><br />&quot;My mother and father watched me constantly. In Athens pretty boys are much sought after. They are stolen and sent by ship to other places. I slept with my brothers who were mean to me. I never in my whole life had a moments privacy. A year and a half ago, bidding started on me. It is forbidden for us to seek self gratification.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander was stunned. His heart went out to the other boy. This beautiful boy who had lived in a cage because of his looks.<br /><br />&quot;You liked watching me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, are you mad, my Prince?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Never at you. Are you hard?&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion lowered his eyes. He couldn't believe he had been so bold. He should have pretended to be asleep. He opened his eyes when he felt the mattress give.<br /><br />&quot;Please let me touch you. I won't hurt you. You should be able to be touched.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion didn't remember nodding or saying yes, but he must have made a sound because Alexander smiled. A smile so lovely that Hephaestion felt like the sun was shining for him alone.<br /><br />Alexander touched the nipples that had called for him earlier. They hardened like two little pebbles under his administrations. Hephaestion moaned and arched his back as if it were the most wonderful thing in the world. Alexander could hear noises outside the room.. As much as he wanted to take his time, he knew he had to hurry. He flattened his hand and ran it down Hephaestion's torso, loving the feel of hard muscle in the slim frame. He ran his hand over Hephaestion's balls and gently gripped his cock, squeezing lightly. Hephaestion cried out. The sound alone was enough to almost make Alexander come again. The liquid that leaked from Hephaestion's cock made Alexander lick his lips. He leaned forward to lap at the slit, Hephaestion's moans urging him on. He had never done this to another boy, but he'd had it done to him enough to know the basics. He didn't know how to go deep, so he just sucked on the head of Hephaestion's thick cock. His hand squeezed the rod, moving up and down. With a cry that Alexander thought would bring others to their door,&nbsp; Hephaestion came into his prince's mouth. For the first time Alexander tasted somebody else essence. He couldn't get enough of the taste that was uniquely Hephaestion's. He swallowed it all, craving more.<br /><br />&quot;Is it always so wonderful?&quot; Hephaestion asked after catching his breath.<br /><br />&quot;No, this is different.&quot; Alexander hadn't even got off with Hephaestion, and yet it was the best sex he had ever had. &quot;I love you Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh Alexander, I do too. I wish we were normal people and I could just be yours. What are we going to do?&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;You don't know who bought you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No,I don't know when we will find out. &nbsp;When we are sixteen we go to your fathers palace for service to the king. Ale,&nbsp;I'm scared.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I'll talk to my father. He'll help us. Don't worry, Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />The bells sounded for breakfast. They had to go, but not before Hephaestion received his first kiss. Alexander pressed his lips to the lush lips of innocent boy. When Alexander felt&nbsp;Hephaestion's lashes&nbsp;flutter against his cheek, his heart burst with joy.<br /><br />When Hephaestion felt the gentle touch of Alexander's&nbsp;fingers against his cheeks along with the incredible&nbsp;feeling of their lips being pressed together, he nearly swooned.<br /><br />&quot;Don't worry Hephaestion. It will work out somehow. It has to. You belong to me now.&quot;<br /><br />King Phillip and his first general, Cleitus the Black rode into Meiza. It was the&nbsp;fifth week of schooling for his son and his friends.&nbsp;Olympia was going mad having her son away from her. Of coarse anything that upset that woman was an added bonus for Phillip. Visiting day at Mieza was a day of excitement for the young men eager to show their fathers what they&nbsp;had been learning. He spotted his son talking with Ptolemy and Ptolemy's father who had rode here with Phillip. A little ways away there was a group of other&nbsp;boys. Five beautiful young men. By the Gods,Phillip thought, what beauty stands on his lands and not on Mount Olympus.The Eromenos from Athens. He looked over and saw Cleitus&nbsp;eying the boys and gave his friend and lover a hard look until Cleitus noticed his displeasure.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alexander ran up to him holding the hand of one of the boys.. The king and Cleitus dismounted, handing the reins to one of the slaves. Phillip gave a quick hug to his rapidly growing boy.<br /><br />&quot;Joy to you father,&nbsp;General Cleitus. This is my friend from Athens, Hephaestion Amnitor.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know your father well,&nbsp;Hephaestion. A brilliant general. And an exciting and worthy adversary.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you, King Phillip. I wish he spoke as admirably about you.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander looked mortified, but smiled when he&nbsp;heard his father's laughter.<br /><br />&quot;You are a brave lad with a quick wit. What are your private studies that will serve your new&nbsp;king?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Actually Sire, I am&nbsp;mastering skills that I have already learned. I am a multi linguist. I speak all the close but different languages of Greece. I speak the language of Thebes. Egyptian was the hardest. I speak the language of both Rome and Gaul, and the three&nbsp; languages of Persia.&quot;<br /><br />The king was momentarily lost for words.<br /><br />&quot;By Zeus, boy. You are worth your weight in gold with skills like that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So my family thought, Sire. That is why I am in Macedonia and my family is in Athens living in luxury.&quot;<br /><br />Both the king and Cleitus laughed at that.<br /><br />&quot;You'll be worth having at court for your sarcastic wit alone.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Father, I would like to talk to you.&quot;<br /><br />'Of coarse my son. It is why I am here.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion excused himself and went back to his friends.&nbsp;Phillip noticed that none of the boys had any family&nbsp;present. Athens was a journey to be sure, but not so far to visit the sons who had saved their worthless necks. Especially Amnitor who had received twice as much as the other boys fathers. He said as much to his son who&nbsp;agreed.<br /><br />&quot;Tell me my son, Would you have done what these brave lads did? Sold yourself into bondage in order to save your family?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Of course I would father. But I would not have had to. You would not have lost. And in a way although I think&nbsp;Hephaestion has great courage and honor, I don't think his father does. He sold his son. I don't think you would have done that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You're right. I would have risen up again and just killed the man. Now then, I hope you have a letter for me to take home to your shrew of a mother.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander was used to his father's words against his mother. Normally, he might say something, but now he wanted his fathers help with Hephaestion.<br /><br />&quot;Yes father, one telling her how lonely&nbsp;I am, and how much&nbsp;I miss her.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;By gods, you scamp. You're a smart boy. She'll make my life miserable of course. Ay my shoulders are wide enough to carry her load of abuse. Damned shrew,&quot; He said almost fondly.<br /><br />&quot;Father, about Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I knew it! You have fallen for the pretty lad, haven't you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have strong feelings for him, yes.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;How could you not? He is a jewel among swine. He will be&nbsp;my greatest weapon in the world. With his languages. He has strength and courage. A born diplomat. He will be the crux of all treaties we make with other lands&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You bought him, didn't you&nbsp;Father?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes Alexander. It was my final death blow to the Athenians. Cruel, but they don't deserve him. Or the others either. This gives them a chance. Even if they don't see it now.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Father, you can still&nbsp;use his&nbsp;languages for&nbsp;your army, but I want him. Gift him to me, Father.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Gift him to you? I paid a large fortune for him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I love him, &nbsp;Father. And he loves me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Love. Nonsense. Lust at best.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That too. Yet it&nbsp;is<em> </em>love.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip heaved a sigh. The things one might do for their children. When Phillip had first seen the boy over two years ago, he set events in motion to ruin Amnitor. To get his hands on that boy. &nbsp;He hadn't wanted a boy so badly since Cleitus almost twenty years ago. He had ached for the boy since. Only Cleitus could appease his lust. Cleitus who threatened to leave him once and for all. They both had lovers and wives, although he hated when Cleitus took someone else. Through the years there was one constant. They loved each other. Now Cleitus felt threatened by this boy. The exquisite creature&nbsp;who had the lust of both king and prince. Only Cleitus had ever been so beautiful in the kings eyes. Cleitus who would leave him. He looked at his son. Alexander loved the boy.<br /><br />&quot;What will you do with him?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will take care of him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He must stay owned for nine years, or his family must forfeit the money.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That's alright.&quot; Alexander&nbsp;had a secret thrill of owning Hephaestion.<br /><br />&quot;Alexander, he can not be gifted, or re-sold until he turns eighteen. If you are good, and don't shame me, I will gift him then.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you Father.....Father, why did you want him?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just because I am old does not mean I that I am dead. I covet the boy. It is a&nbsp;gift beyond compare that you ask of me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You...you won't take him will you, father?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;When you are both sixteen, you will be in the armies service,&quot; Phillip said. &quot;If it were Macedonian law, I would have already had the boy.&nbsp;That the boys were eighteen before we take them is one thing the Athenians were adamant about. I will honor that wish, If you are good, I will gift him then. Alexander, I don't care what you and the boy do. Be circumspect. There might be rumors. Rumors are always alright. Don't make it public until he is&nbsp;yours.&quot;<br /><br />Phillip really did not care if the boy were a virgin or not.&nbsp; He did not&nbsp;love him. Once the two boys were adult, they would find how hard it was to keep love pure. He and Cleitus found that out the hard way. Let them have this time for their young love. It will be a treasure forever.&nbsp;Meanwhile he would appease his lover when he told him he was gifting the boy. Maybe Cleitus would make it worth the loss, he thought excitedly. And finally he might get Alexander away from that bitch's claws. Whether he took the boy at least once or twice when he turned eighteen remained to be seen.<br /><br />&quot;I should head home. The diplomats from Thebes will be here tomorrow.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I wish&nbsp;Hephaestion and I could go with you, Father. I want to be involved in your talks!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You would have&nbsp;my crown before I am ready to give it up. I have a feeling Alexander, that your entire life will be one battle after another. Yours is a restless soul. Enjoy your youth. Enjoy your young lover. Someday you will look back at these times with a great longing. Your time will be here fast enough.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes&nbsp;Father, I hope you have luck with&nbsp;the men from Thebes.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am just feeling them out. There will be war with them, of this I'm sure.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Father, I have to be home in two weeks for Mother's birthday.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;By Gods is that coming up again? I will be sure to gone.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Father, may I bring Hephaestion?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Push, push, push. If your mother finds out that you love this boy, she will have him killed.&nbsp;Or worse.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;She has always wanted what's best for me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes as long as she decides what is best. Just be careful. It wouldn't hurt if you invited the other four boys along with your friends. Just be sure to spend a few hours with her alone. And bring her something.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh Father, she is never satisfied.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Don't I know it?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Father, thank you. We have been so scared of whoever bought him. I'm so glad it was&nbsp;you.&nbsp;I can't wait to tell Hephaestion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You will have many treasures in life. He will be your greatest. And your hardest to hold if you are&nbsp;not careful. We'll see you in two weeks. I've got to rein in Cleitus. He has been mad at me for weeks. I think it will be a good night.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Father, my young ears.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ha! Before I go, I need to ask you something. ........Have you taken Hephaestion yet?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, he&nbsp;says it is forbidden.&nbsp;But I think he is just nervous.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Most likely both. You have never had a virgin,&nbsp;my boy.&nbsp;Go&nbsp;slow with him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will cherish him Father.''<br /><br />Cleitus rode up, leading his kings horse.<br /><br />&quot;I guess we will see you in two weeks for the queens birthday, Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes Cleitus, can you try to have father there?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will. Right now it pleases me to make your father unhappy.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I think that is about to change,&quot; Phillip said, swinging up onto his horses back. &quot;I've got some news for you. my love.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander laughed watching his two fathers ride off. Cleitus had been in his life since he was born. He was glad that his falling in love with Hephaestion would bring&nbsp;Cleitus happiness.<br /><br />&quot;Did your visit go well, Alexander?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Let's go down to the lake and I will tell you all about it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You just like&nbsp;touching me under the water.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Mm, very much.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hey, lets go down to the lake.&quot;<br /><br />Ptolemy and Cassander were there with the four Athenians. They were all grinning.<br /><br />Alexander and Hephaestion followed the others&nbsp;down to the lake. Somebody had brought a leather ball which was being kicked around. Alexander joined in. Hephaestion preferred swimming as did his friends from Athens. When Hephaestion felt hands touching his hips from behind he turned around. &quot;Told you, you just like touching me under the water.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Out of the water, behind the stables, in our bed. I have much to tell you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Will I like it?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Do you love me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You know I do.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Then you will like it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alexander! Come on. It's your ball.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Go back to your game. You can tell me tonight.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Tonight then.&quot;<br /></font></div>"

CHAPTER ONE</font>

<div class=""ljcut"">
<font size=""3"">It was the end of summer. August yet, so the days were still hot. The earth had a rich warm smell to it, and the bugs and birds made a symphony of sound. It was Mieza. The second day of school for Alexander and his friends. Alexander sat on a rock next to Ptolemy, his friend of many years. Ptolemy, like most of his friends, were friends because their fathers were in the court of King Phillip, his own father. The late summer sky was bright blue. Alexander loved the color blue. He...........

&quot;Alexander! Alexander are you daydreaming on the second day of school?&quot;

The man speaking was their teacher of Philosophy; Aristotle. Phillip had brought him in from the city of Athens to teach his son and the other sons of the hierarchy of Macedonia.

&quot;I&#39;m sure your illustrious father would not like a report on you so soon in the school year.&quot;

&quot;No sir. I am sorry sir.&quot;

&quot;Pay attention Alexander. You must teach yourself discipline and patience. Now as I was starting to tell you, we are expecting five new students from Athens tomorrow. As much as I don&#39;t like to talk about certain things, I&#39;m afraid it falls to me to explain some things to you.&quot;

Aristotle took a deep breath. He had never been a great lover of the flesh, and it was difficult to explain what was most common for other men. He usually only gave his own views.

&quot;These boys fathers are the most elite of Athens. Their lineage goes further back then any of Greece. Unfortunately they have rebelled against current rule. Which I might add is no fault of the son&#39;s. Property and monies have been seized. The only way to restore which they have lost is to sell something. But with everything having been seized, there is nothing left to sell but the daughters and sons of the family. The five boys here are eromenos. But a little bit different then what is common. They have sold themselves for nine years to a erastes. Huge amounts of money have been paid to the families of these boys. Enough to restore land and keep the rest of the family in splendor for life. They have saved their family through their own sacrifice. Their benefactors will keep them for nine years, educate them well, teach them a craft that will make them an affluent member of our own society for the rest of their lives. They are heroes to their families. They are not whores, and I will not tolerate them being treated as such. Treat them with compassion and respect. You never know what position they may hold in your own lives.&quot;

&quot;Master, why would anyone pay such enormous amounts of money, when we have slaves and servants aplenty in Macedonia.,&quot; asked the ever pragmatic Ptolemy?

&quot;These boys are boys of great breeding. They are already more educated then most men. They are an asset to any man. More then that, and I know you are young.....&quot;

The boys were fifteen, not so young, but Aristotle saw them that way.

.....&quot;I know you are young to understand. These boys are boys of unsurpassed beauty. More alluring then any women or boy in Athens or in all of Greece some say. Their beauty is from the Gods themselves. Phillip wants them treated like the royalty from which they were born. The law says they may not even be touched by their erastes until they are eighteen. They are virgin. They have a protected innocence. You will treat them with honor. Now then, you have battle study in&nbsp;thirty minutes. You are free until then. &nbsp;I will see you in the morning....&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander, a word with you if I may.&quot;

&quot;I have assigned rooms to our new students. Four of them will share two rooms, the other boy I would like to have share with you, since you have a room of your own. I think it might be good for the boys transition if they already have the friendship of the prince.&quot;

&quot;I will give them my friendship, master, but I enjoy my privacy.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, I look to you to guide your friends. this is not open for debate. I am giving you the&nbsp;courtesy of knowing before hand. The boys will be here on the morrow. You will stay after class and I will introduce you to your new room mate.&nbsp; Is that understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes&nbsp;master,&quot; Alexander hoped he would like this new boy. Truth be told it would be nice to have a friend that wasn&#39;t forced by his own father to&nbsp;gain Alexander&#39;s friendship.

It was toward the end of class the next day when a servant whispered into Aristotle&#39;s ear that the Athenian&#39;s had arrived.

The five boys followed a slave down the path to the classroom. Alexander didn&#39;t know if they had been taught to walk the way they did or if it was because they were just so different then any other boy he had ever met.&nbsp; They were devastatingly sexy the way their limbs moved. All five were exquisite. Alexander could feel his desire for the boys in the tightening of his loins. He could hear the ragged breath of his friends around him. He even noticed the shifting of Aristotle himself when the boys reached him. Their was one boy who was even more beautiful then the others, and it was he that Cassander pointed out when he leaned into Alexander.

&quot;I know that boy. He is Amnitor&#39;s son. I saw him when I had to go to Athenian court with my father. His father has right to rule Greece, he fought yours for power, Alexander. By the Gods he is beautiful. I wish I could have bought him.&quot; Cassander said crudely.

Alexander who had been thinking the same thing didn&#39;t like it coming from Cassander&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Shhh, you&#39;re going to get us in trouble, Aristotle is looking.&nbsp;&quot;

Aristotle after introducing the boys and asking them to sit down fired off a series of questions about the works of Socrates, and Plato. He asked questions that the Macedonian boys did not know. The Athenians did not raise their hands, but when asked, they knew every answer. Cassander was convinced that Aristotle did it on purpose.&nbsp;Aristotle &nbsp;was Athenian himself, after all. Alexander wasn&#39;t sure. Shouldn&#39;t their master be above such a petty thing?

&quot;We will stop here. Your report on the Iliad is due by weeks end. For the new students, I have had a scroll placed on your beds explaining what we are doing. I am sure you will find it easy to catch up. You have wrestling class in two hours. I would like to see you use your time wisely. Dismissed. Hephaestion, you will stay for a moment please&quot;

Alexander made his way to the front of class. It was the great beauty who was to share his room. Talk about a lesson in discipline.

&quot;Alexander, this is Hephaestion Amnitor. Hephaestion, this is Prince Alexander.&quot;

The two boys nodded politely.

&quot;Hephaestion,&quot; Aristotle went on,&quot; I hope your stay with us will be satisfactory.&quot;

&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; the youth said quietly. His voice was as beautiful as the rest of him. It had a timber to it that sent chills of desire down Alexanders back.

&quot;And your family is well?&quot;

&quot;They are now, sir.&quot; 

Alexander couldn&#39;t tell if it was said bitterly or with humor. Evidently neither could Aristotle, as he dismissed them&nbsp;after one last remark that would remind Hephaestion not to show arrogance in the classes of the Philosopher.

&quot;I hope you can use whatever benefits you can from your stay with us to better your current place in life, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir, I am sure that I am most fortunate to have been given this opportune chance to * better&nbsp; myself * &nbsp;through the sale of my body.&quot;

With one last look at Hephaestion, Aristotle decided to leave it alone.

&quot;You don&#39;t like our teacher? Alexander was confused by Hephaestion&#39;s reactions to the teacher.

&quot;He is pompous. In Athens it is said that he is a sell out. But who am I to talk. I like him fine, Prince Alexander. I am sorry to have shown you my bitterness.&quot;

&quot;You are angry over your situation?&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you be? But, I am pragmatic. From here on in I will make the best of it.&quot;

The two walked together up the walk to the dormitories. Alexander watched Hephaestion out of the corner of his eye.&nbsp; Hephaestion&#39;s hair was chestnut and looked like silk to the touch. It was shoulder length. Longer then any of the boys there. His cheekbones were high, and his eyebrows were shaped to add to the allure of his beautiful eyes. Eyes with long dark lashes. Lashes that Alexander longed to feel fluttering against his own cheeks.as they kissed. Eyes that were as blue as the sky that Alexander loved.

&quot;You are staring at me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot;

&quot;You are too, but I am trying not to stare.&quot;

&quot;You think I am beautiful?&quot; Alexander was surprised. Nobody had ever called him a beauty except for his mother.

&quot;Your eyes are like twilight, and your hair like the sun. Yes, yours is a rare beauty.&quot;

Alexander had been sexually active for two years. It was hard growing up at court and not passing up the boys his father threw at him, the girls his mother made him see. He wanted a lover of his own. Wished for one even. He knew Hephaestion was a virgin. A virgin until he was eighteen. Alexander wished Hephaestion&#39;s innocence could belong to him. To only him. Maybe his father could intervene. He had only asked for one thing his entire life. His horse. 

&quot;Did Aristotle say we have wrestling today?&quot;

&quot;Yes, do you know how?&quot;

&quot;We have wrestling in Athens too.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry Hephaestion. I offend you.&quot;

&quot;No, my prince. It is I who apologize. I am quick with my tongue.&quot;

&quot;Well, don&#39;t ever curb your tongue for me.&quot;

Hephaestion was sure there was a double entendre there,&nbsp;and he blushed.

Alexander laughed and led him to the room to get ready to go to wrestle.

Later&nbsp;all the boys had two matches each under the watchful eyes of the Macedonian wrestling coach. Four of the Athenians had lost each time. Hephaestion lost to the heavy Nearchus. Later he beat Alexander. Alexander&#39;s friends were quick to offer excuses for him.&nbsp; Athens was known for their culture, plays and playwrights, for their medicine, and philosophy. For their politics and education. They were not known for wrestling. His friends&nbsp;said&nbsp;that the other boy must have cheated. He was from Athens after all. They were also known for their cunning of survival. Alexander knew what the disadvantage was. His naked skin against the oiled down skin of Hephaestion.

It was after supper, when the boys were back in their rooms, that Alexander mentioned Hephaestion&#39;s family.

&quot;I know who your father is.&quot;

&quot;I know yours as well.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want our fathers to come between our new friendship.&quot;

Hephaestion closed his eyes for just a second.He felt a quick stab of pain.

&quot;No, Alexander, I will try not to let our fathers come between our friendship.&quot;

Alexander saw the pain in Hephaestion&#39;s sapphire eyes.

&quot;Hephaestion, do you want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;No I can&#39;t right now. It is too new for me.&quot;

&quot;I am here for you if you need to talk.&quot;

&quot;It would not be right, Alexander.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the prince.&quot;

&quot;Not in this room. Here I am just your friend.&quot;

There was a knock at the door.

&quot;Alexander are you coming?&quot;

&quot;I will be there in a few minutes, Cassander.&quot;

&quot;We are going swimming down at the lake. Come with us.&quot;

&quot;I will get my friends, and join you there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll wait for you.&quot;

&quot;No Alexander. I Heard what your friends were saying today about us. It is best for you if you do not associate with us. Or at least as little as possible.&quot;

&quot;You are a friend, and if I have to hide that I like you, then I may as well denounce any future crown. As I am not fit to wear it. I will go with you and your friends, Hephaestion Amnitor.&quot;

Hephaestion knew he shouldn&#39;t. But you can not tell the heart what to do. He fell in love with the brave prince. This was the young man that Hephaestion had always dreamed. Instead he had prostituted him self for his families fortune. If it had been one of his brothers forced to sell themselves, Hephaestion would have been fine with being poor, and working like everybody else in order to save his brother. &nbsp;His family had only been to happy for Hephaestion to sell himself to save them. His brothers never had a chance with any girl with Hephaestion around. And Hephaestion was prettier then his sisters. The men that might have looked at them, could only see Hephaestion. He looked at the shining prince.

&quot;Let&#39;s go then.&quot;

They stopped at the rooms to pick up Hephaestions friends, who were excited at the prospect of swimming which they all loved. The boys, Domine, Kortos, Heinex, and Pietos were happy to be befriended by the prince. Hephaestion&#39;s father was the ruler&nbsp;of Athens, and they had always looked to Hephaestion for leadership. They knew he had no power, but he would move mountains to protect his friends. By becoming friends with the crown prince, they had an ally in these scary times.

When Alexander introduced them to his friends, The Macedonian boys were nice in front of the prince who had befriended the eromenos. 

Alexander who loved his&nbsp;friends sat down with them to show them that they were still his lives companions. There was some friendly joking with the Athenians, who teased back in return. It was alright. Hephaestion met Alexander&#39;s eyes in gratitude.

The Athenians got up to swim. As a group they took off their robes. They were naked underneath. Their bodies were toned from the Mediterranean sea. Their skin was tanned from the Athens sun. They were ravishing. Hephaestion looked at the prince.

&quot;Will you swim with us?&quot; Hephaestion held out his hand innocently to the prince who grasped it in his. Their eyes met. The souls that had been separated through time found each other. But at this time it was a love forbidden.

&quot;Oh no. I don&#39;t have a good feeling about this,&quot; Ptolemy said as he watched his friend and somebody else eromenoi walk hand in hand to the lake.</font></div>"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

<div class=""ljcut"">
<font size=""2""><font size=""3"">&quot;How did it go?&quot; Ptolemy asked when Alexander sat down at the breakfast table. 

Alexander had ridden in the evening before, and after a quick report on the goings of Babylon; had gone straight to bed.

&quot;You were right. They are doing fine work. Watching the construction of the bridge was very exciting. I am glad I was able to see it.&quot;

&quot;So am I, Alexander. Now please, tell us how Hephaestion is.&quot; Craterus implored. &quot;Cassander is not fit to watch over him, sniffing around that Egyptian boy. I will go with him the next project he does.&quot;

&quot;Yes, that is a good idea. Alexander, I think that Hephaestion should not go into battle anymore. His heart is really not in it.&quot; The usually cranky Emennes told his king. &quot;He could help me. He is very good at making plans for this great army. I could use help with the bookkeeping.&quot;

Cleitus and Ptoemy exchanged looks. Those two were like two mother hens, taking poor Hephaestion under their wings. Hephaestion had sent letters back with Ptolemy, asking Craterus for more stories of the past, because * Hephaestion enjoyed them so much&nbsp;*. He also wanted to make sure that Emennes was taking his medicine. The two old grumpy men, had never had anyone care for them as Hephaestion did. They loved him for it.

Craterus got up to leave, sure that his king would not be forthcoming about Hephaestion. He was sure the boy was fine or Alexander would have said.

Emenues followed saying, &quot; I had better make sure cook has vegetables and fruits that Hephaestion loves. I&#39;ll swear I&#39;ll have her head if she.........&quot; his voice trailed off as he left the room.

Alexander looked at the other two in bewilderment.

&quot;Hephaestion will not quit fighting, I have asked him also.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright. those two will just blame you anyway. You&#39;re already the cruel king that hurt their boy.&quot;

&quot;What we really want to know, Alexander,&#39; Cleitus moved in,&quot; is, how did it go?&quot;

&#39;It went fine, Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;Did he forgive you?&quot;

&quot;Well no, not really.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what we heard.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Soldiers talk, my king.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and Hephaestion screams,&quot; Cleitus laughed.

The two soldiers got up and started backing from the room, taunting their friend in a sing-song voice.

&quot;Oh, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Harder, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Deeper, Alexander.&quot;

Cleitus laughed again. &quot;That Hephaestion sounds like he&#39;s a demanding little thing.&quot;

&quot;Oh, my king, you&#39;re so good.&quot; Ptolemy got one last taunt in.

Alexander sat red faced, alone at the table. He could hear them laughing down the corridor.

Hephaestion let himself be fucked. Proud of it even. Let himself be dominated by Alexander. Surrendered himself into Alexander&#39;s hands. And if that were the case, Alexander wondered when he had lost control to Hephaestion. It wasn&#39;t just him. Hephaestion had made his whole army crazy.

It was two days later that Perdicus ran into the council room.

&quot;Soldiers, Alexander. Twenty-five soldiers, just a few hours ride from here. We don&#39;t know how they slipped by patrol.&quot;

&quot;Well who are they?&quot;

&quot;Romans, Sire.&quot;

&quot;Romans!&quot;

The men all jumped up.

&quot;Romans? What are they doing here?&quot;

&quot;Are there more of them?&quot;

&quot;Where did they come from?&quot;

&quot;We talked to them, Sire. Conus is escorting them here. They came in on a ship that is anchored next to Nearchus. They spoke to Nearchus in depth, so they say. They also said Nearchus sent messengers. Maybe the rebels got them.&quot;

&quot;Or the Romans caught up to them, &quot; Alexander said. He had changed from loving friend to fierce king in a moment. &quot;They would want the element of surprise for talks.&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t come for war talks, Alexander. They came to see Hephaestion.&quot;

Alexander thought for a moment.

&quot;No. My lover is good, but Roman soldiers don&#39;t ride through the lands of Alexander for a social visit. Craterus, take your men, and meet Cassander. If they made it this far without detection, Cassander may already be in need of help. Put Hephaestion in the middle. Kings order. Please hurry, my friend. Parminion, you and Philotius send out more patrols. Search the area. Perdicus, take your men, escort the Romans to Babylon. Conus is not enough. Cleitus, Ptolemy, gather soldiers. We will greet the Romans outside the city gates. Let them see the might that guards Persia. We will disarm them before we welcome them to Babylon. Arm yourselves as Macedonians ready to battle. Even if it is not this day. Let us go. Rome is at our gates.&quot;

When the soldiers of Rome rode into view of Babylon, it was the soldiers of Macedon that greeted them. King Alexander himself rode to the front. He wore the armour and crown of a Greek king. Cleitus and his men surrounded the Romans and demanded their weapons. If these men had traveled the land of Persia, then they were fluent in the language of the men that ruled it.

Three men came to the front. They were dressed in the fine uniform of roman elite. One man was a diplomat. Alexander could always tell a diplomat. It was the other two that earned Alexander&#39;s scrutiny. They were obvious brothers.Twin brothers.

&quot;We have come seeking information on Hephaestion Amnitor. We have not come as a enemy of this empire. We greet great King Alexander.&quot; It was one of the brothers who spoke.

As a unit they all bowed low on their horses.

The diplomat spoke next. I am an emissary of Titus of Rome. May we enter your city as friends?&quot;

&quot;If you were friends, you could. Why are you really here?&quot;

&quot;We have told you, King Alexander of Persia.&quot;

&quot;I rule Persia. We are Macedonian.&quot;Alexander&#39;s hand swept the hundreds of soldiers that surrounded them. &quot;You are here uninvited. You did not send a messenger to seek council, as is custom. How many more are you?&quot;

&quot;Just us. We did not bring numbers to Persia. We brought horses instead.&quot; The diplomat smiled at his joke. &quot;There are ten more of us still aboard our ship which is being watched by your man.&quot;

Cleitus rode to sit beside Alexander. He was always an impressive sight.

&quot;We are ready, Sire.&quot;

Alexander looked at the brothers. He ignored the diplomat.

&quot;We have a large room for you to stay the night. We will give you food and wine. We will give you pleasures of the flesh if you so desire. You are not welcome. We will escort you back to your ship, which will be escorted back to sea to Rome.&quot;

&quot;We want to see Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;He is not yours to see. Follow me now, or leave now. Your choice.&quot;

The diplomat bowed his head.

Alexander led the way in to Babylon. The soldiers looked on&nbsp;in wonderment the same as&nbsp;Alexander&#39;s own army did, the first time they entered.

They were led to a large room. It had privacy walls and cubicles. There were couches set up. And large cushions and pillows through out the room. It was exotic and comfortable. Darius had used it as an orgy room. There were tables set up with foods of Persia to impress the Romans. Wine was plenty. And there were women and boys already in the room, for the soldiers amusement.

&quot;You will stay here. You are under guard.&quot;

Alexander turned to leave.

&quot;Where is Hephaestion Amnitor? We came to see him.&quot;

&quot;You did not come here for Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Great King,&quot; the twin whispered so that his own people did not here. &quot;My brother and I did come to see Hephaestion We got him away from the Praetor who was mad for him. He left quickly on the first ship out, that happened to be leaving for Egypt. My name is Marcos Centoris, this is my brother Antony. We are his friends.&quot;

&quot;I know what you are to Hephaestion. He is happy with us, and he is well. He is not here. If he is back before you leave, I will grant you some time with him. I owe you that for saving him from Titus.&quot; Alexander walked to the door.

&quot;Wine, Alexander?&quot; Ptolemy asked when the king entered the council room.

&quot;Just a little. Can you believe that Roman Ruler? The audacity of that man to send Roman soldiers to the city that belongs to Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Did the twins really come to see Hephaestion, Sire?&quot;

&quot;He must be a wonder in bed for the Romans to come here to see him.&quot;

&quot;Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;Well, we were all thinking it.&quot;

&quot;Quit thinking of him that way.&quot;

&quot;They can&#39;t take him, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;I know. I do think he is going to be causing me trouble our whole lives. Mounted soldiers from Rome here to take him back with them if they could. What&#39;s next? Is that Norse man he was involved with going to be riding in on the great white polar bear?&quot;

&#39;No,&quot; Cleitus chuckled,&quot; He will be sailing in on a big block of ice.&quot;

The men all laughed. But there was tension in the room.

&quot;Seriously, we have our own agenda. We will have to watch these Romans. Have Cassander write his father. get any information we can. When Rome decides to meet Alexander on the field of battle, we will be ready for her.&quot;

&quot;Sire,&quot; a servant entered. &quot;Hephaestion&#39;s party was almost home when Craterus found them. They are here, my king. They will be here in a few minutes.&quot;

When Craterus, Cassander, and Hephaestion entered, Alexander stood to greet his lover.

&quot;Alexander is it true? Romans here?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;

Cassander who was smarter then most men, was already thinking.

They came to steal Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;They say not. Let Ptolemy and Cleitus fill you in. I will take Hephaestion in to see his friends.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, who is here?&quot; Hephaestion asked when they were out of the room.

Alexander told Hephaestion about the Romans ruse to get inside Babylons gates. He told his lover that the brothers really did want to see Hephaestion, and he thought that they volunteered for the mission for just that reason.

&quot;Will you allow me to see them, my king?&quot;

&quot;You have to be careful of what you say to them, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;I know, Sire. I am a soldier in the army of Alexander. I am always a loyal Greek.&quot;

&quot;I will have the guards bring the twins to another room. I will not give the emissary a chance to grill you.&quot;

Alexander and Hephaestion waited for the two brothers to be brought into the room. The look on the faces of the twins changed from stern warriors to boyish happiness when they saw who waited in the room. Hephaestion ran into the arms of one to be hugged and passed off to the other brother. Although Alexander hated seeing his lover in the arms of another, the trust started now. It was only Hephaestion who was truly his in the world. And he would trust his lover to keep it that way.

&quot;Hephaestion, I will leave you alone. I will give you only one hour. I have to leave a guard at he door. They are the enemy of these lands.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sire. Will you meet my friends?&quot;

&quot;We have met.&quot; Alexander looked at the brothers. &quot; You will have every comfort this night. You will be escorted to the sea at first light. We will send food to break your fast before dawn. The two of you have nothing to worry about.That is my gift to you for the great gift you have given me.&quot;

Alexander went to talk to his men, while Hephaestion visited. When he returned over an hour later, the three had said their good-byes. It was unlikely they would see each other again. This trip was a gift to them all. Hephaestion had left so fast the first time, that there was hardly time for farewells.

The two lovers&nbsp;slipped into the hot water that a servant had ready for them. Hephaestion was exhausted. It was a long four months. He had hurried to get done. He, Nefrus, and Cassander had ridden most of the night. When they were met by soldiers, and the kings companion the adrenalin hit. Now it was nice to lay in the water and let the king wash him.

&quot;Do you forgive me yet, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;So easily?&quot;

&quot;I forgave the act almost as soon as it happened. We are men, Alexander. We both might make mistakes. We will be away from each other for long periods of time. We will try not to let it happen, but if it does; it &#39;does not&#39; mean anything. The lesson was that I wanted you to see what we are to each other. First and foremost there is us. We are connected by the gods. I have searched for you on three continents. You waited for me to find you. You do not give a gift of love like ours away.&quot;

&quot;I will never doubt again, my love. You are all that I love, Hephaetion. All that I need in this world.&quot;

&quot;You are all that I am, Alexander.&quot;

The two left the bath and dried off. Their love making before sleep was gentle. Hephaestion was on his side with Alexander behind him, moving inside of his&nbsp; body in deep slow thrusts. They came together, both of them feeling the enormity of their love.

&quot;Hephaestion, you know I have to marry. Are you going to be mad at me when I have to visit her?&quot;

&quot;Are you going to neglect me?&quot;

&quot;By the Gods no!&quot; I don&#39;t want to marry. I have to.&quot;

&quot;I know. Women of today know what to expect when they marry a king. They know what they are for. You will visit with this woman a few times a week until she is with child. I will not begrudge her a full night sometimes. Not often. Especially if I am on location elsewhere. But you must explain this to her, before you marry. She will bear your children. She will be your wife. But she will never be your beloved.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can do it. Don&#39;t tell anybody, but I don&#39;t really like women in that way.&quot;

Hephaestion gave a delicate shudder. &quot;I don&#39;t either. Marry the first girl that has some spirit, that may help. Also she might give us spirited sons. I can&#39;t wait to be a dad. Our little Alexanders running around.&quot;

&quot;You can marry also, Hephaestion. So that you can have daughters that my sons can marry.&quot;

&quot;Ew. no. You will even have to bathe when you come back to my bed after visiting your wife. I don&#39;t want you to smell like a woman. Ew. Lets never talk about women in our bed again, unless we have to.&quot;

Alexander smiled to himself. He liked that idea. He would talk Hephaestion into it. But not for awhile. He wanted Hephaestion to himself for a few years, before he had to share. He knew he wouldn&#39;t share well. He gathered Hephaestion to him, only to find his tired lover was already asleep. Alexander grinned. They would sleep in the next morning.

Alexander roused himself to see Cleitus off before the dawn.

&quot;Do you want us to kill all of them?&quot; Cleitus asked.

&quot;No. Execute all of them except the brothers. Surround the brothers, and take them out. Kill the others fast. Take enough men, Cleitus. We don&#39;t want any surprises. Kill them soon. Bury and burn everything. Have the horses brought back to Babylon. Escort the twins to the harbor. See if Nearchus is alright, and ask that good man how many men it will take to sail the Roman ship. Kill the others. Have them escorted to the sea. Let the brothers give Praetor Titus Alexander&#39;s message. Never return to these lands, as long as Alexander is alive. Be safe Cleitus.&quot;

&quot;We will be, Sire. Good health to you. Now go crawl back into bed with Hephaestion.&quot;

Alexander undressed again and slipped back into bed next to his naked lover.

&quot;Did you give the order?&quot; Hephaestion asked sleepily.

&quot;Yes, my love. The brothers are safe.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Because of them I have you.&quot;

Alexander rolled over on top of his lover. Letting him feel his whole weight. Letting him feel the steel-like rod he got as soon as his skin touched Hephaestion&#39;s.

&quot;Fill me, Alexander.&quot;

After a quick swipe with the oil, Alexander entered Hephaestion, who had locked his legs behind his kings back.&nbsp;&#39;So tight. So good,&#39; he thought. He looked down upon his beautiful lover, who smiled back at him.

&quot;I love you, my king&quot;

&quot;You too.&quot;

&quot;Deeper, Alexander.&quot;

Alexander smiled. He hoped&nbsp;Ptolmey didn&#39;t hear, or they would taunt him in the morning. He pushed harder. He didn&#39;t care.

&quot;Harder, Alexander.&quot;

<font size=""3"">&quot;I am happy the great king is here, Cassander,&quot; the Egyptian servant mused.&nbsp;&quot;It is written that they should be together. I was starting to despair. They are cute together, are they not?&quot;

&quot;I told you he would be here, Nefrus. You must learn to listen to me. And please, do not let Alexander hear you call him cute. Only the Gods know what kind of unreasonable reactions that man has.&quot;

&quot;You love him, Cassander.&quot;

&quot;He has so much power over people. You listen to him, and you see his vision. I think he is the greatest king the land has ever known. The world will never be the same again, when Alexander leaves it behind.&quot;

&quot;Shall we go and swim with the king and Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;I have swam with Alexander enough. We swam many times&nbsp;as children, when ever he could get away from his mother. So no, my little Nefrus. Let us go back to my tent. It is not often that we don&#39;t constantly have to watch Hephaestion. I have to leave for patrol soon, I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to take you in the day light hours.&quot;


Alexander and Hephaestion had a nice day at the stream. They shared the wine, and the bread. They swam and played naked in the water. There was one spot that was quite deep, and Alexander picked Hephaestion up and pulled him through the water. The men who made their way down, joked with Hephaestion and shyly talked with Alexander. Happy that their king was among them. After a few hours, the soldiers came back from patrol, which meant that it was Cassander&#39;s turn to ride out. Hephaestion was surprised that Alexander didn&#39;t want to scout around himself.

&quot;I came here to see you Hephaestion, not ride with Cassander.&quot; Alexander decided he liked making Hephaestion smile. It was remarkably easy to make him happy. They still had to talk this evening but it was a nice afternoon, one of the best days Alexander had ever spent. Hephaestion had a way about him that made Alexander lay aside his crown and enjoy life for a little while. He seemed to do that with everyone.

When they got back to camp, Alexander smiled when he saw the flowers he had picked in a pot, in the middle of Hephaestion&#39;s desk.

They sat on the bed together.

&quot;Alexander, why did you cheat on me?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you don&#39;t realize how beautiful you are.&quot;

Of coarse Hephaestion knew that, but he couldn&#39;t tell Alexander that.

&quot;I know I treat you badly. I never thank you for the work you do, and I often neglect you.&quot;

&quot;Have I complained?&quot;

&quot;No, but I know others want you.&nbsp; I know they want to treat you good. You have loved others, Hephaestion. You are my first love. My only love. It drives me crazy that you love so many men.&quot;

&quot;You are the only man I love right now. The only man I&nbsp; want to be with for the rest of my life.&quot;

&quot;I know that.&quot;

&quot;No, you don&#39;t. Or you wouldn&#39;t be so scared&nbsp;that I&#39;m going to leave.&quot;

&quot;My mother wrote me a letter. She heard about us. About you. Someone in camp wrote to tell her that I was involved with a whore who was out to ruin me. She wrote horrible things about you.&quot;

&quot;Parminion or that damn son of his. They bear watching Alexander. I don&#39;t trust them..... You listened to your mothers words, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;She has always known how to strike at me. To make me listen, even when I know not to.&quot;

&quot;Well, I am screening her letters from you from now on. The woman is evil. She said I would cheat on you, that I would leave with another, didn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Yes, she said all that.&quot;

&quot;So you figured you would&nbsp;lay with another&nbsp;before I would betray you?&quot;

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

&quot;You pushed me out of your life, out of Babylon, before I could leave you?&quot;

Alexander just nodded.

&quot;You have some issues, my love.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;You promised you would talk to me if you were having problems. When I tried talking to you that night, you wouldn&#39;t listen. My own fears didn&#39;t matter to you. I tried to talk and you brushed my feelings aside. I have never felt like I was a whore until that night. You used me like a whore in the kings camp. You made me feel dirty.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry though, Hephaestion. I&#39;m so ashamed of myself. I don&#39;t know what to say except that it will never happen again.&quot;

&quot;The bad treatment and the rape are not the reason I am mad, Alexander.You betrayed me. If you want a open relationship where we have others, you should tell me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t want others to have you. I hate that they already have. And, I don&#39;t want others either. Please forgive me. It won&#39;t happen again, I swear it on my life.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can trust you.&quot;

&quot;Will you at least think about it . You never know what&#39;s going to happen in life, Hephaestion. I can&#39;t stand to think about losing time we could have spent together.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it. You leave tomorrow, and I should be done in a few days. All I have left is the planking, I should be in Babylon before weeks end.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, I hurt myself also. I am so ashamed at the way I treated you. I had no honor. Let me make it up to you. Let me try and make you happy. You will never lose me to the world, because you are the world to me.&quot;

&quot;Is Bagoas still in our rooms?&quot;

&quot;I never touched him again, Hephaestion. I gave him to Cleitus.&quot;

Hephaestion stood before the king and slowly took off his robe.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t mean I forgive you. But, you might as well start making it up to me. It has been too long for me. I need you. I need you to make love to me.&quot;

Alexander got on the floor to kneel before his naked lover. He looked up at Hephaestion through adoring eyes., then leaned forward to kiss Hephaestion&#39;s leaking cock, loving how it stiffened at the first brush of his lips. Alexander&#39;s own cock was hard and heavy, jutting up towards his belly. Alexander lapped at Hephaestion&#39;s slit, tasting his cream. He tasted so good. He wanted more, but Hephaestion was pulling on his hair to&nbsp;make him stand. He got slowly to his feet, kissing Hephastion on the way. When he was standing he leaned in to kiss Hephaestion&#39;s moist parted lips, then surprised his lover by picking him up and&nbsp;lifting him in the air.

&quot;Alexander, put me down. I am too heavy.&quot;

With his hands behind Hephaestion&#39;s shoulders and under his knees, Alexander carried his lover to the bed.

&quot;You are not heavy, my love. You are strong and hard. But you are also slim and compact. I love being able to lift you up and cuddle you to me.&quot;

&quot;I need you to cuddle me under you right now.&quot;

&quot;I would like to taste you first. You know...back there. I liked it when I tried it.&quot; Alexander still blushed when talking about that.

&quot;I know you liked it. But I need you in me. I feel so empty. Please fill me, Alexander.&quot;

Alexander reached for the jar beside Hephaestion&#39;s bed. He was happy to see it unused, the jar still full. Alexander hoped he could get rid of these remaining insecurities. The oil smelled fruity. Nefrus always made such fine oils for Hephaestion. Cassander must be pleased at that also. He would have to remember to tease his friend.

&quot;Alexander!&quot;

The king&nbsp;reached down and slid two fingers into his lover. He loved having his fingers inside of Hephaestion. He loved feeling him, and looking at his lover when he was being touched like this. Alexander felt a little guilty at the feeling of power he had over Hephaestion&#39;s pleasure.

Hephaestion by this time was in bliss. he loved feeling Alexander put his fingers inside his body. Loved feeling them wiggling back and forth. Alexander was so gentle. He had enough gentle. 

&quot;Please Ale, more. I need more.&quot;

Alexander swiped his cock with oil and thrust inside his lover. He didn&#39;t put Hephaestion&#39;s legs on his shoulders he just grabbed his ankles and held his legs up and apart. He fucked Hephaestion slowly, but hard and deep. Watching himself sink over and over into his lovers accepting body. He didn&#39;t think there could ever be a more wonderful sight. Hephaestion moved his hips to meet Alexanders thrusts. He gripped the sheets and arched his back. He was moaning and panting loudly. Begging Alexander to fuck him harder. He was uncaring of the camp around them that must be listening.. He looked so wanton. So desirable. He enjoyed his pleasure so much. And Alexander knew that Hephaestion liked when Alexander watched him. Enjoyed having Alexander know that he was coming undone in his kings arms. He was such a sexual little thing. Alexander looked back down and watched his cock bury itself in Hephaestion&#39;s tight ass. He was so turned on by the sight that it was almost a surprise when Hephaestion came suddenly, screaming Alexander&#39;s name.His ass clenched Alexander&#39;s cock so wonderfully tight that he was milked dry.

Alexander gently put Hephaestion&#39;s legs on the bed. He grabbed a moist towel that smelled of jasmine that Nefrus had thoughtfully placed&nbsp;by the bed,&nbsp;and cleaned them both off.

He gathered Hephaestion into his arms.

&quot;That was the most&nbsp;incredible five minutes of my life.&quot;

Hephaestion giggled, burrowing even deeper in his lovers arms.

&quot;I&quot;ve got to learn to last longer with you. It just feels so good. Can you forgive me now, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. You were with somebody else. You can&#39;t do that and expect me to just give in when you say your sorry. I&#39;ll be back in a week. We can discuss it then. We&#39;ll work it out.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion I need to know you are mine.&quot;

&quot;I was yours, you pushed me away.&quot;

&quot;I know, baby. I made a mistake.&quot;

&quot;How about I make the same mistake?&quot;

Alexander got up and held Hephaestion&#39;s hands tightly in his own. He held them down on the pillow, on both sides of Hephaestion&#39;s head.

&quot;You will not lay with anybody else, Hephaestion. I could not look at any man in my army or all of Babylon and know you were with him. I would have to kill him, and I don&#39;t want to have to kill anybody because you&nbsp;shared yourself with them.&quot;

&quot;Alright, I don&#39;t want you to kill anybody, warrior king. But I still don&#39;t forgive you. You&#39;re going to have to grovel a bit more.&quot;

&quot;Who ever said that being a king was easy. You&#39;re hard work.&quot;

&quot;You better be hard and ready to work when I get back to the palace.&quot;

Alexander held Hephaestion to him, tightly wrapped in his arms. Proving his love and getting Hephaestion to forgive him was going to be hard work. And a lot of fun.</font></font></div>"

<font size=""3"">Hephaestion showed Alexander what they had been doing. Alexander was amazed. There were enormous rocks, that had been moved with horse power,carved right out of the cliffs and creek bed. There was a path down the gorge from the camp side, but no path up the steep wall on the other side. Hephaestion had a series of steel spikes drilled into the cliff. The rocks below were used as abutments for the oiled down logs that had been used to build the bridge. Holes had been chiseled and drilled into the rocks and cliffs edge, and log ends were put inside. Mortar was used to keep the logs in place for years to come. The other end of the log had been carved&nbsp;and fitted and spiked to fit into the end of another log. Ropes, ladders and&nbsp;pulleys, were up and down both sides of the gorge so Hephaestion could direct any log no matter where he was. He had the blacksmiths melt down heavy steel shoes to spike it all together. The result was a criss cross maze of engineering brilliance. Alexander told Hephaestion how very proud of him he was, and to Hephaestions joy, Alexander told the workers the same thing.

Alexander was standing back, looking at the bridge, and watching Hephaestion directing fifty people at once. He was a great leader. All the men seemed eager to please him.

&quot;He is really something, isn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;Hello Cassander. Every day I learn how special he is.&quot;

&quot;Took you long enough to get here.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, not you too.&quot;

&quot;The men all love him. He talks to each and every one of them. He knows their names and even about their families. He talks over everything he plans with them, so that they can learn. If one of them gives an idea, he acts so proud of them and gives them too much credit. It is&nbsp;usually things that he planned anyway. But they love him for it. <em>And</em> he&nbsp;runs out to meet every patrol to see if they come back safe and whole.&quot;

&quot;By Zeus Cassander, you sound like you love him. You! Hard ass that you are.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s hard not to. I bet the men back at Babylon miss him.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Alexander, you watch everything and know everything. But you are so busy worrying about Hephaestion&#39;s ass that you haven&#39;t taken the time to know the man. There is so much to love about him besides his ass. Which I have to admit, it is a very fine bottom.&quot;

&quot;Cassander.&quot;

&quot;Oh lighten up my old friend. Nobody is going to poach on what belongs to Alexander. Did you know that he sits and talks to Cleitus about your father. Cleitus likes to talk about how they were young and in love.&quot;

&quot;I would like to talk about my father in his nicer years. I wonder why Cleitus never talks to me.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion <em>asks</em>. He also sits and talks to Cratarus about the good old days of when <em>men </em>were <em>men. </em>Hephaestion acts as if it&#39;s the most interesting thing in the world. And you and I both know he hates war. Hephaestion will ask questions and let Craterus talk and&nbsp;reminisce about all of his dead friends.&quot;

&quot;Gods, how boring.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion helps Ptolemy write beautiful love letters and sonnets to his wives.&nbsp;Do you know how Eumennes is always complaining about his gout?&quot;

&quot;Yes, the&nbsp;crotchety old buzzard. But he hasn&#39;t been lately.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because Hephaestion went to some old persian lady he heard about and begged the lady&nbsp;for her remedy that he heard she had. She didn&#39;t want money, she wanted company. He sat with her for hours, charming her for that remedy. Well Hephaestion made Eumennes.drink the potion every day, even drinking some himself at first to prove that it wasn&#39;t poison. Eumennes gout is gone.&quot; Cassander laughed at a memory. &quot;Do you know how Hephaestion was always complaining on the trail about the lack of fruits and vegetables?&quot;

&quot;Yes, he calls it proper diet. He even makes me eat those roots and leaves.&quot;

&quot;He makes all of us. Anyway, Eumennes went to your cook at Babylon and threatened her very life if he didn&#39;t see vegetables on the dinner table every night.&quot;

&quot;He didn&#39;t?&quot;

Alexander was amazed.

&quot;He did.&quot;

&quot;And you Cassander? What has he given you?&quot;

&quot;Ah, my king. He has given me the greatest gift of all. Even now, your face betrays you. You are afraid of what I am going to say. When are you going to trust Hephaestion, Alexander? He has been nothing but devoted to you. His father was a high lord. He has as much right to the kings crown as your own father. Hephaestion hated politics so much that he ran away from home in order to avoid it.&nbsp; And now he aligns himself with a king. I know he helps you at times. Hephaestion hates war. Ran away because he never wanted to fight. He&#39;s not afraid. He just loves peace. But he likes your idea of uniting the world, even if it is through combat. So he takes up a sword and jumps in the thick of battle protecting his lovers back. My God Alexander, what does that poor boy have to do to prove his love and loyalty to you?&quot;

Alexander was quiet, digesting Cassanders words.

&quot;Remember a couple of days before you sent Hephaestion away? You received a letter from your mother. Zeus knows what that women wrote&nbsp;that caused you to hurt our sweet brother, but I do know you were mad at me for something my father did back in Pella. I was supposed to go with Cleitus to look for Darius, but you told me to stay behind with the women and old men. I was so angry.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry for that Cassander. I&nbsp;wish people would call me more on my temper.&quot;

&quot;We try, Sire. <em>You</em> need to listen more. We do have your best interests at heart. Anyway Hephaestion asked me what was wrong and when&nbsp;I told him, he looked all happy and said &quot;Good now you can go fishing with me&quot;. Of coarse I didn&#39;t want to go fishing and&nbsp;I told him so. He looked so unhappy. He said that he and Nefrus had heard about a nice stream a mile out of the city and they were going fishing. Can you imagine?&quot;

&quot;No I can&#39;t.&quot; Alexander was livid. &quot;What were they thinking? Leaving the city all by themselves with Darius and Bessos out there. Anything could have happened.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought. You really&nbsp; have to watch that boy. So I took ten of my men and went fishing with those two scamps. While I was there I remembered how young I still was. We all had a wonderful time. It was there that I fell in love.&quot;

&quot;Cassander, who?&quot;

&quot;With Nefrus.&quot;

&quot;I am happy for you, my old friend.&quot; Alexander then looked at his general mischievously. &quot;Are you going to have him wax your body like he does Hephaestion&#39;s?&quot;

Cassander laughed. &quot;No, I like my hair. But he waxes his own body along with Hephaestion&#39;s. And I quite like it.&quot;

&quot;Yes I feel the same way.&quot;&nbsp;The two friends shared a easy smile, thinking about their lover&#39;s smooth young skin. But then Cassander looked towards the bridge, frowned and stepped forward.

&quot;What? What is it?&quot;

&quot;We have lost two men putting those cross tresses on. They slide the two beams from each side of the gorge. The horses hold them steady, but we have to be ready to cut the ropes if the log slips, so that the horses don&#39;t get hurt. The&nbsp;man in the middle of the bridge butts the logs together to be spiked. But if they slip, he is in danger. Hephaestion keeps wanting to do it, but I have senior rank here, and I won&#39;t let him.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for that.&quot;

The two walked forward to watch. Cassander stood ready to grab ropes and the king to help where ever he was needed. The two logs moved slowly towards each other. They had been cut to link together and Harmos, &#39;the man on the bridge&#39; was ready to direct and to start driving the large spikes to secure them to each other, and to the rest of the bridge. It went smoothly except at the end when Harmos&#39;s rope got caught and the man was propelled off the side of the bridge. He was tied to his rope, but he became entangled in the other ropes that were there for different reasons. Everyone gasped and shouted at once. 

There were high poles stuck into the ground on each side of the bridge. They had ropes attached to them which were strung from another high pole sticking up in the middle of the bridge. Before anyone knew what he was doing, Hephaestion grabbed a rope and made a running, flying leap off the side of the gorge.

Alexander&#39;s heart nearly stopped. He grabbed Cassander&#39;s arm and shouted his lover&#39;s name. Hephaestion reached out to grab another rope to stop his momentum. He was jerked and he slipped a little bit, but he was all right. He started to make his way down to the tangled worker. Men from the other side worked their way over to the bridge&#39;s middle. Cassander started over from the camp side, the king following.

&quot;No Sire. It&#39;s not safe.&quot;

&quot;Cassander move. I am going.&quot;

When they made it to the middle of the bridge, Alexander appreciated his lovers work even more. The men pulled up Harmos first. He had a dislocated shoulder, and a strained neck, but otherwise alright. He thanked the king for being there, and told him what a wonderful man Hephaestion was. They had to go by Cassander and the king to get to camp, but they were used to the high beams and hurried right by. Alexander wanted to pull Hephaestion up, but the men had already started. So he knelt, ready to grab him when he reached the top. When he did, Alexander bundled him into his arms. Hephaestion wrapped his arms around his kings neck, and buried his face in his lovers neck.

&quot;Come on Sire. I want you off the bridge. it&#39;s not stable yet.&quot; Cassander was asserting his authority.

&quot;Thank you, Cassander. I see Nefrus watching. He seems most concerned.&quot; Hephaestion teased.

&quot;He keeps complaining that you&#39;re making him old before his time, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;He and I both,&quot; said Alexander.

Alexander stood up, and together the two men made it to the side. Cassander stayed to help drive spikes. He enjoyed this bridge business.

&quot;That&#39;s enough everybody,&quot; Hephaestion shouted.&nbsp;&quot;Afternoon off in honor of our king! Turning to his lover, he gently touched the king&#39;s arm. &quot;Alexander, I just have to talk to the steel smiths about something for tomorrow. Then we can make our way down the path to the stream for a swim.&quot;

&quot;Swimming Hephaestion. Not fishing.&quot;

&quot;Cassander has been talking,&quot; the engineer pouted.

&quot;Go on, water nymph. Go talk to your man.&quot;

While Hephaestion got his plans, and went to talk to the steel forgers, Alexander hurried over to the edge of the glade. There he picked a bunch of blue flowers that were growing there. When again Hephaestion found him, he had his hand behind his back.

&quot;What have you got?&quot;

Much like a child, Alexander held out his flowers to Hephaestion.

&quot;Did you pick these?&quot;

Alexander nodded.

&quot;You picked me <em>flowers</em>?&quot; Hephaestions eyes were shining bright and there was a big smile on his pretty lips. Alexander felt like kissing him.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you picked me flowers. I&#39;m not a girl. You give flowers to a girl.&quot;

&quot;They reminded me of your eyes. You don&#39;t have to keep them, Hephaestion.&quot;

Hephaestion pulled his hand back.

&quot;I&#39;ll just go and get a couple of towels and then we can go.&quot;

When Hephaestion came out of the tent he had left behind the flowers. But along with the towels he brought a flask of wine and half a loaf of the honey-nut bread.

Together they walked to the steep path that led to the creek below. Alexander reached out for Hephaestion&#39;s hand, just as Hephaestion turned and yelled to Cassander and Nefrus.

&quot;Are you two coming?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion,&quot; Alexander whispered. He had wanted some privacy.

&quot;Alexander, everybody makes their way to the water before the day is out. You have to learn to share me. Just like I share you when you are doing your king stuff.&quot;

&quot;My king stuff?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Besides Alexander, these men are your soldiers. You ask them to fight for you. It doesn&#39;t hurt for you to spend a little of your free time with them.&quot;

&quot;You humble me, my love.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good for you.&quot;

&quot;I was proud of you today. But you scared me too.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, I&#39;m proud of you as well. Now you know just a little of what I feel, when&nbsp;I see you battle. You fight like a fierce lion. What I do is nothing next to you.&quot;

&quot;You are everything next to me. Everything to me. We still have to talk, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;Tonight, Alexander. Tonight.&quot;</font></font>

By the time he got back to Babylon five weeks later, he found that Hephaestion had returned and left again. Along with twenty wagons of supplies, and tools. He and Cassander took fifty workers and twenty-five soldiers. They would all work in shifts. Alexander knew that the smaller north gorge was a four month job. He wanted to go but he had all the Persian dignitaries, the royal family, the political court, and&nbsp;prominent citizens he had been neglecting. So he composed a letter, telling Hephaestion of his mothers warnings, and his fears. He explained how busy he was, and asked for forgiveness. He sent the letter with Ptolemy, one of his own companions so that Hephaestion would know how important he was. Alexander figured that his lover would leave his work for a few days to surprise Alexander. It was such a good letter that Alexander had daydreams of Hephaestion running into&nbsp;his arms.<br /><br />Ptolemy had sent word back that he was staying to help Cassander for awhile. It was five long weeks later that he returned. Alone.<br /><br />&quot;You should see the work they are doing. Cassander and his soldiers are strutting like peacocks. They have been helping and are most proud of there accomplishments. I tell you, Alexander you should see them work. Not just the finished project, but see the construction. It&#39;s amazing. That boy of yours is a marvel. I didn&#39;t want to leave, it was so enthralling. It&#39;s going so well and he has so much help, that Hephaestion says he&#39;ll be done in a month.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;How was he Ptolemy?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;His eyes have a sad look that I don&#39;t like seeing in them. And he is a little thin, but he <em>is</em> working sixteen hour days.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Did he see my letter? Did he say anything?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The only thing he said was that if you loved him so much, if you were as sorry as you say, then you could have spared a few days to come tell him yourself.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Gods, what do I do now?&quot; Alexander rubbed his face, holding his head for a moment.<br /><br />&quot;Go see him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And say what? I already said everything in the letter.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Let him know he&#39;s special,&quot; Cleitus said. &quot;Go look at the work he is doing for his king. He sure bent over backwards trying to please you enough.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander just looked at Cleitus in bemusement.<br /><br />&quot;Alright, here&#39;s what you do.&quot; Cleitus looked at Bagoas who was standing inside the doorway. &quot;Bagoas, if you tell the cook something, does she know that it is an order for the king?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, she knows that by now. She would love to do something special for the king.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Good tell her to start baking her special honey-nut breads. Fifty loaves, Bagoas. Tell her it is top priority. We need them ready and packaged by tomorrow morning.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I will tell her. I will go right now.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What was that for?&quot;<br /><br />Ptolemy who was closest reached over and whacked Alexander on the side of the head.<br /><br />&quot;Even I know that Hephaestion loves that bread. He will be most pleased if you bring some for his workers as well.&quot;<br /><br />&quot; Just watch him work, Alexander. Help if you can. Show your pride in him. Pick him some flowers. A big bunch.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Flowers! No way. He&#39;ll laugh.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, but he will love them. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to give him gifts once in awhile. It&#39;s what lovers do.&quot;<br /><br />Alexander looked away. He had never given his lover a gift.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ptolemy gave him another whack.<br /><br />&quot;Ow. Quit doing that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Flowers and gifts show him that you think of him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alright, alright, I&#39;ll pick flowers. I&#39;ll bring him gifts.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No don&#39;t bring him anything now. He&#39;ll think you&#39;re trying to buy him. Wait for that. Don&#39;t you know anything about love?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Alexander.&quot;<br /><br />Oh no Cleitus again.<br /><br />&quot;Get rid of the boy. Get him out of your rooms.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But I haven&#39;t slept with him since that night.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hephaestion should be able to walk into his own rooms without seeing the boy you betrayed him with. I&#39;ll take him, I like him&quot;<br /><br />Alexander laughed. &quot;Talk to him. If he is willing, then yes. Take good care of him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh, I will.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ptolemy, do you think he misses me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He is heartbroken without you Alexander. But don&#39;t expect him to give in easily. Go rest now, my king. I&#39;ll arrange your escort and your treats. If you leave at first light, you can sleep on the trail for a few hours tomorrow night, and be at Hephaestion&#39;s camp the next morning before dawn to give the men your bread for breakfast. Hephaestion starts early. I&#39;ll send my man with you. He&#39;ll get you there at just the right time.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you, my friends. You don&#39;t think I am weak for this do you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Zeus, Alexander,&quot; Cleitus yelled. :You would be stupid not to. There&#39;s nothing wrong with love, my boy. Now go get your man and don&#39;t lose him again.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Alexander had already seen Cassander&#39;s patrol. Gave his men several loaves of bread to share, much to their delight. Camp food wasn&#39;t much. The men did not warn Hephaestion of his arrival, but they informed General Cassander. Cassander was happy that his king had finally came to his senses , and come after his suffering friend.<br /><br />Alexander sat on his horse atop of the hill over looking Hephaestion&#39;s encampment. He could see the bridge in the pre dawn light. He could feel his lover near. His heart beat with fear and anticipation. He was as nervous as if he were going to battle for the first time. And in a way he was. A battle he could not lose. His life depended on it.<br /><br />Hephaestion looked up at the ridge and watched Alexander&#39;s&nbsp;silhouette against the early morning sun.. Finally, he was finally there. Nefrus had given him a full skin treatment last night in anticipation of Alexander&#39;s arrival. But he turned now to clean his teeth and braid his hair. He then sat down at his desk to look at his plans.<br /><br />The tent flap opened and Hephaestion turned. The lovers just stared at each other for a moment, drinking in the sight of the other.<br /><br />&quot;Alexander, what are you doing here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I came to see how the work goes.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion looked down, disappointed.<br /><br />&quot;And I came to see you, beautiful Hephaestion. I have missed your presence.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion felt himself blush, but at least Alexander had the grace to pretend he hadn&#39;t noticed.<br /><br />&quot;Welcome to our camp, Sire. I am eager to show you our work. Would you like some fruit juice? Nefrus should be bringing food. Although I&#39;m sure it is not what you are used too.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have already seen Nefrus. He is helping the royal guard pass out these to your men.&quot;&nbsp; Alexander brought two loaves out from his bag.<br /><br />&quot;Mmm honey- nut bread. You really brought some for the men?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, my love, I really did.&quot;<br /><br />Hephaestion poured them each a glass of the fruit juice and cut into the bread. After passing Alexander his piece, he cut a good size one for himself.<br /><br />&quot;I am glad to see you eat, Hephaestion. You look thin.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is so good. And it is really the first time I have felt like eating in months.&quot; Much to his dismay, he felt himself blush again when he realized what he had said.<br /><br />Alexander just nodded and said &quot;Me too.&quot;<br /><br />Nefrus entered hesitantly.<br /><br />&quot;My lord, the men are waiting.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thank you, Nefrus. I will be just a moment.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;May I show you your bridge, Alexander?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I want that very much. I have been so proud of the reports I have been given. Hephaestion, can we talk tonight?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Tonight, Sire.&quot;</font><br /><br /></lj-cut>"

<font size=""3"">Alexander and his companion&#39;s were in awe when they entered the harem of King Darius. The whole day had been like that. Babylon was a magical city. Alexander looked around at his people. He was glad he could give his companions this pleasure. They had been loyal soldiers and friends. He noticed the appreciative glances that both he and Hephaestion were getting. Many eyes lingered on Hephaestion. How could they not. He saw one boy in particular looking at his lover. He was beautiful with his high cheekbones and raven hair. The boy was lovely, but not the jewel Hephaestion was. When the boy felt Alexander&#39;s eyes on him, he looked at his new king. Alexander glanced at Hephaestion who was looking straight at him with eyebrows up.

Hephaestion didn&#39;t seem jealous that he caught Alexander staring at another, only curious. It was there in the middle of Babylon&#39;s royal harem that his insecurities returned. Hephaestion was extremely sexual. Many wanted him. Lately Alexander had been so busy, he was too tired for sex. Just wanting to hold his lover and go to sleep.. It was only a matter of time before Hephaestion turned to someone else.

Hephaestion was enjoying the queens chambers. The bed seemed not to be used. It was thick and soft, with warm soft blankets, and tons of plush pillows in different colors. He smiled remembering the good natured jokes that accompanied his staying in the queens rooms. He went through the adjoining doors to greet his king, finding him reading letters. He then noticed the boy. The same boy that Alexander had been staring at earlier that day.

&quot;Who is this boy?&quot;

&quot;His name is Bagoas. A gift to the king .He is a servant.&quot;

&quot;I know what he is Alexander. He is much more then a servant. Give him to someone else.&quot;

&quot;He was a gift.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t receive a gift of something you already own. You own all the <em>gifts</em> in the harem. He is going to cause problems, Alexander. Send him back there.&quot;

&quot;I will not. He will be helpful to me. You have your Nefrus.&quot;

&quot;Nefrus does not live in the same chambers as us, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Us? The last time I checked this was Alexanders chambers, not the bridge builders.&quot;

Hephaestion was stunned.

&quot;Should......should I leave, Sire?&quot;

&quot;Is that what you want? To leave?&quot;

&quot;Alexander?&quot;

But Alexander was gone. In his place were the demons. He grabbed Hephaestion and dragged him to the bed in full view of the slave. He pushed Hephaestions face down on the bed, and threw his robe up over the back of his head, exposing his legs and ass for viewing.. Alexander wasted no time. He didn&#39;t undress. He just pulled out his cock and pushed inside of Hephaestion. He didn&#39;t prepare him. He didn&#39;t give him time to adjust. He just plowed roughly into him. It was over in less then a minute. When Alexander pulled out, he saw blood on his cock. When he pulled the robe away from Hephaestion&#39;s face, he saw the tears. Alexander had raped his lover.

The boy was nowhere to be seen. Alexander got a damp cloth and lovingly cleansed his lover, before cleaning himself. He got a healing ointment and gently put some into Hephaestion. His lover hadn&#39;t said anything yet. Alexander was sickened and ashamed that he had hurt his lover that night. Guilt ridden by the rape, he wanted to gather Hepaestion and keep him safe. He remembered how Hephaestion told him that the Praetor of Rome had abused him. Had Titus raped him also? Alexander wanted to make everything all right, but he couldn&#39;t. He was also unreasonably angry at Hephaestion for causing him to treat him this way. Hephaestion was driving him crazy. He drove everybody crazy with want of him. After tonight how long would Hephaestion belong to him? His head hurt. He just wanted to go to sleep and forget this night ever happened. He pulled Hephaestion into his arms, where the young man started silently weeping into his chest. They fell asleep like that. Holding each other tightly. The distance tearing them apart.

Relations were strained during the next week. Alexander was busy with the Persian court, and obsessing over Darius. He loved Persia. If only he could calm his fears concerning his lover. His mother had learned of the <em>bridge builder</em> he had taken to his bed and had written terrible things about Hephaestion. Alexander loved his paramour so much, but he was afraid the man would be his ruination, not his salvation. He wanted to keep Hephaestion only to himself, but he knew that in order for him to survive, to lead as king, he would have to give up Hephaestion. Even his mother told him that Hephaestion&#39;s power over him would bring him down. By the gods, he didn&#39;t want to let the man go. He just needed time to think. To be sure that Hephaestion was really the one for him. Maybe it was just lust. He needed to know. He knew that Hephaestion was heartsick over the rape last week, but he uttered not one word of recrimination. He was even nice to Bagoas when he saw the boy, who stayed in the kings chambers, Hephaestion slept in the queens rooms. They both missed each other, but they kept apart. The <em>wedge</em> between them slept in the servants room that separated&nbsp; the king and queens. Bagoas.

Hephaestion knew the ways of the world. Knew the ways of men. Knew the ways of his king. Alexander had&nbsp;told him to scout out the east and north ridge to find the best place for his bridge that would shorten the distance to Bactria, and the great northern empires. He was not supposed to start that project&nbsp;until the area was secure. But Alexander would send an army with him. Cassander volunteered. They would leave after breaking the fast the next morning. Alexander did not seek him out on that last night. And if Hephaestion&#39;s suspicions were correct the relationship was almost over and Alexander didn&#39;t have the balls to talk to him. Well, Hephaestion would confront him. With Cassander&#39;s help, Hephaestion would sneak back into Babylon and see with his own eyes if Alexander intended to betray him. He would sleep now and rest up. He would need his sleep if he was going to defeat his clueless king.

The next morning at breakfast, he sat with Nefrus and Cassander finalizing the journey. When it came time to set up camp at the bridge sight, Nefrus would come to take care of Hephaestion. But for right now, it was just Hephaestion and Cassander, Hephaestion&#39;s workers, and fifty of Cassander&#39;s best men. Hephaestion watched the king being served by his new slave. He also noticed the glances that Alexander threw his way when he thought that Hephaestion was not looking.

&quot;How do you do it, Alexander?&quot; Paminion asked. &quot;First you have Hephaestion, who was the lover of Titus. Then you have Bagoas, who was the lover of Darius. They must be skillful in bed. Did the other kings train them well?&quot;

&quot;Be careful Parminion, you insult me..&quot;

No defense of himself or Bagoas, Hephaestion noticed. Bagoas met Hephaestion&#39;s eyes for a moment. Comrade&#39;s in pain. Only Bagoas could never speak up for himself. His eyes had tears in them. He was young, no matter what he had been through. But Hephaestion could turn anything around.

&quot;Ah the price we pay for our beauty, eh Bagoas?&quot; Hephaestion tossed back his hair and slanted his eyes seductively. &quot;Bagoas and I know the pleasure and pain our gifts can bring to us. It is too bad you will never know what it is like to be loved by kings, Parminion.&quot;

Bagoas smiled. He liked this kind blue eyed man.

The other companions laughed at Parminion&#39;s expense. But Hephaestion was not done.

&quot;In fact my first lover Sven was a prince in his lands. He is most likely king by now.&quot;

&quot;Is that when you became the whore of Rome?&quot;

&quot;No, first I sampled some of his gladiators,&quot; Hephaestion laughed. He wanted to see Alexander&#39;s rage.

Nefrus who could see what his friend was up to spoke up.

&quot;In Egypt,&nbsp;Pharaoh before Alexander used to write Hephaestion love sonnets. In that land men have ceremonies to honor their relationship. Pharaoh wanted Hephaestion terribly.&quot;

&quot;Is that true?&quot; Alexander slammed down his cup. &quot;Have you been going from one king to the other?&quot;

&quot;Well Sven was a prince. Only you and Titus were kings. I didn&#39;t sleep with Pharaoh. He was old. All he wanted to do is watch me fondle myself. Shall I show you Sire, what he asked of me?&quot;

&quot;Get out! All of you get out! Cassander wait for Hephaestion outside. And Cassander remember what I told you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll watch him with my life. No person will come near him.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re telling people not to touch me now&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m trying to keep you safe.&quot;

&quot;Like you did the other night?&quot;

&quot;Is that what this morning was about? You were talking like a whore.&quot;

&quot;I was talking no worse then any other man boasting of his conquests. I&#39;m sorry to have hurt you, but you let Parminion say those things about me and about your new lover. A lover who can not defend himself.&quot;

&quot;Bagoas is not my lover. You are.&quot; After all Alexander was not ready to lose Hephaestion. &quot;Lovers fight, Hephaestion. I am sorry about the other night. I saw my father rape my mother once. I hate that I acted like him.&quot;

&quot;Did your parents love you, Alexander?&#39;

&quot;In their way. My mothers love is smothering. Fathers was brutal. I&#39;m sorry I hurt you, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;I think you are about to hurt me more.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Hephaestion wanted to tell Aexander not to betray him with the boy. To trust in their love. But Alexander would have to find out the hard way.

&quot;Just because I have to leave for a week and I have missed you.&quot;

&quot;Please be careful out there, Hephaestion.&quot; Alexander gave him a small kiss good-by. Hephaestion looked at him for a moment and swept from the room.&nbsp; He would return after dark.

Hours later, leaving the soldiers Cassander and Hephaestion re entered Babylon.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you should do this.&quot;

&quot;I have to, Cassander.&quot;

&quot;But he&#39;s king. He can do whatever he wants.&quot;

&quot;No he can&#39;t. Too many kings for too many years have thought that they can do whatever they want. Maybe they can. But there has to be repercussions.&quot;

Hephaestion entered the Queens room, in order to go to Alexander&#39;s. He heard the noise before he saw the act.

Alexander pounded into the boy in front of him. He wasn&#39;t as hard as he would be for Hephaestion. But the boy was skillful. Not as skillful as Hephaestion. In fact Hephaestion could teach the boy a thing or two. God what was he doing? He was going to lose his lover over his own insecurities. He was fucking this boy, and all he could think about was Hephaestion. His erection waned and he was about to pull out of the boy when something caught his eye. He looked over and saw his stunned lover watching him. Tears were falling from his eyes. Before Alexander could act, Hephaestion bolted from the palace and he and Cassander stole away into the night.

Alexander ran from the room , shouting for his&nbsp; lover. He yelled at the guards for not stopping him, but they didn&#39;t know they were supposed to.. Ptolemy and Cleitus ran around the corner of the hallway, swords drawn.

&quot;What happened? Are you well, Alexander?&quot;

Alexander just looked at Cleitus. He gripped the sheet he had grabbed tighter around him, and uttered just one word; &quot;Hephaestion.&quot;

Just then Bagoas peeked around the&nbsp;doorway wearing the matching sheet. He looked scared and had been crying. Cleitus felt sorry for the boy, and heart went out to him.

&quot;Oh Alexander, you fool,&quot; Ptolemy moaned.

&quot;I have to go after him.&quot;

&quot;Give him time, Alexander. He&#39;ll not forgive you this night. He&#39;ll be back, and you can grovel then,&quot; Cleitus warned. &quot;Cassander will take care of him. Let him go, boy.&quot;</font></lj-cut>"

<font size=""2""><font size=""3"">The new lovers held each through the night and the nights to come. Hephaestion moved in to the kings rooms. When they moved east to Persia, Hephaestion had his own tent where he kept the equipment he needed for high bridge work, his maps and drawings as well as personal belongings and momentos. Since Hephaestion slept with Alexander , Hephaestion&#39;s friend and servant used Hephaestion&#39;s tent as his own. Nefrus and Hephaestion had met months before in Egypt. Since the boy had no family, he decided to leave with Hephaestion to the land of Persia. Nefrus made body wax, scented soaps and shampoos that he used on Hephaestion&#39;s body. At first Alexander didn&#39;t like Nefrus to be in his lovers tent. Especially after walking in on a naked Hephaestion being rubbed down with a scented oil after being waxed. He soon saw that the two friends were just that. Friends. And he did like what Nefrus did for Hephaestion&#39;s body.

Hephaestion relearned what he had learned as a child with his father. Swordplay. He fought by the side of his king, gave helpful ideas about roads and trade, feeding an army, and even&nbsp;medicines. He seemed to have an opinion and knowledge about everything. He became a trusted adviser and companion.

Two&nbsp;months away from Persia, the army encountered a minor skirmish with some Persians. Alexander lost a soldier that was once his page for two years. After his bath that evening, he turned to his lover for a comfort he had never asked for before.

Hephaestion rolled Alexander over and kissed the back of his neck, and &nbsp;licked down his spine. He gently&nbsp;squeezed Alexanders globes, holding them apart. He licked down the cleft, holding Alexander still when he tried to roll over.

&quot;Shhh let me.&quot;

Hephaestion licked around his hole, pushing his&nbsp;tongue in, and nipping around the edges. He fucked and loosened Alexander with his tounge. Without warning Alexander cried out and came.

Hephaestion kissed his bottom one more time and put his oiled finger to Alexander&#39;s hole, pushing in gently. He added another and gently slid in and out, tapping at his prostate. When Alexander started to push back, Hephaestion positioned his oiled cock at his lovers entrance and pushed in. He made love to his king long and deeply; showing Alexander how much he was needed. And only when he felt Alexander come a second time did he allow his own release.

It was what Alexander needed. He&nbsp;wanted to surrender his control and to trust his lover.

&quot;Was it all right?&quot; Alexander asked. &quot;Was&nbsp;I good?&quot;

Hephaestion chuckled and held his lover tightly.

&quot;You were splendid. I hope you will allow me the pleasure again.&quot;

&quot;That thing you did before. Tasting me in that spot. Do you like doing that?&quot;

&quot;Very much.&quot;

&quot;Do you do that with other lovers you take?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes.&quot;

&quot;Do you like it done to you?&quot;

&quot;Again. Very much. Did you like it, Alexander?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Yes I did. I felt a little embarrassed, but I loved it. How come you never told me you wanted that done to you? I must know how to please you, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;I could not tell you without showing you. I could not show you without wanting to fuck you.&quot;

&quot;Will I like doing that to you?&#39;

&quot;I hope so, but I don&#39;t know. Remember when you sucked me for the first time? You didn&#39;t know if you would like it. You were afraid to try. But you did.&quot;

&quot;And I love it. I love the way you taste. I will try this other thing also. I want to please you, Hephaestion. I will give you no reason to seek another lover.&quot;

&quot;Please do not worry about that, Alexander. You have enough on your shoulders. You do not need to add that burden. Come let me hold you. We move out again in the morning.&quot;

&quot;I love you so much, Hephaestion. I will die if I lose you.&quot;

&quot;I feel the same way, my king. Sleep now. Relax.&quot; Hephaestion rubbed his&nbsp;kings back until he felt his lover sleep.</font></font></div></div>"

<font size=""2""><font size=""3"">Alexander sat on one of the large stones, watching the masons lay the bricks and stone that would be the first Alexandria. The city that was going up in his name would be a&nbsp; marvel to architectural greatness for centuries. But it was Hephaestion that Alexander marveled at. With a sweet humble knowledge he took over the building plans before anybody really knew that he wasn&#39;t always in charge. He had the engineers and builders alike hanging onto his every word.

They called a halt during the noonday heat for two hours. They didn&#39;t always do that, but it was a killer heat today if you were working and Hephaestion didn&#39;t want anyone sick. Late afternoon was alright, and it got quite cool in the evenings. They would work whenever Hephaestion asked.

Hephaestion bid Alexander to follow him into his makeshift tent. It was open on two sides facing the river, so Hephaestion had a refreshing breeze. When Alexander entered, Hephaestion pulled him into his arms, and leaned his head forward to kiss Alexander on the side of his neck.

&quot;It was all I could do to keep working. All I could think about was the sun god that was sitting on my building rocks. Please Alexander, let me come to you tonight.&quot;

&quot;I have been hearing rumors lately Hephaestion. They say you have let others come to your bed. Is it true?&quot;

&quot;I love how direct you are.&quot;

&quot;Do not avoid my question. Is it true?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Alexander turned away. &quot;Were they any of my army?&quot;

&quot;No they were both a couple of local Egyptian boys. Just a couple of quick tumbles Alexander. They didn&#39;t spend the night. I didn&#39;t catch a name and they meant nothing except a quick release of frustration. They are not who I want, my king.&quot;

&quot;Do you let them take you, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Alexander, you are not my lover. I don&#39;t have to answer your questions.&quot;

&quot;It is not so easy for me, you know. I have never wanted somebody so much. I have always been above the needs of the flesh. It un mans me this need.&quot;&nbsp; Alexander pulled away from his would be lover. &quot;Did you let them take you.?&quot;

&quot;No, I only like to be taken by somebody I care about.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Alexander.&quot;

&quot;I need to know how many you have cared for.&quot;

Hephaestion heaved a sigh. Alexander was lucky that Hephaestion was learning to love this complex man. If it were any other asking these questions Hephaestion would be indignant.

&quot;Sven, of coarse. He was my only lover for five years. I was loyal.&quot;

&quot;Was he?&quot;

&quot;As a lover, yes. But I woke up one day and he was packing. He felt that his father was ill and his people needed him. He did not know it. He felt it. He left me to fend for myself. I had been with him since I was thirteen. I had money and he left me with a craft. I decided I wanted to get out of Greece so I hired a guide and left for Rome. In Rome when a project was to be built they took bids and listened to your ideas. I won a couple of bids. Pretty soon I had bridges going up all over. Some big ones that were needed. Many small ones that were pretty and added to the beauty of Rome. I was assigned a royal guard. It was there that I met my next two lovers. Marcos and Antony. They were brothers.&quot;

&quot;You were involved with two brothers. At the same time?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Did they know about the other?&quot;

&quot;They were lovers also. We were all lovers. We lived together.&quot;

&quot;Two brothers.&quot;

&quot;Two beautiful *twin* brothers.&quot;

&quot;Twins?&#39;

&quot;Enough, Alexander.&quot;

&quot;I thought that you were with the </font></font><font size=""2""><font size=""3"">Praetor?&quot;

&quot;It was a few months into my relationship with Marcos and Antony when Titus came to my building sight. He was so arrogant. he wanted me to come with him right then. He was angry when I refused. He knew the brothers and was respectful. I didn&#39;t expect that. He came every day to my work place, which was just a little stone walking bridge. He was so powerful and he was bringing me treats and his best wines. I felt......cherished.. I told my lovers that we had to end and that very night I belonged to Titus. I belonged to him for the next two years.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;He abused me. &nbsp;I left.&quot;

Alexander didn&#39;t know what to say. He knew enough. He thought it best to retreat.

&quot;I don&#39;t like that he abused you. I would avenge you if I could.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want your vengeance. I want your love. Let me come to you.&quot;

&quot;I would be the one to do the taking if we were to become lovers, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;I know, my king.&quot;

Hephaestion knelt before Alexander and looked up at him with his devastating eyes. He was a siren, seducing Alexander.

&quot;I welcome it, Sire. I dream of it even.&quot;

&quot;You do?&quot;

&quot;I do. I want nothing more then to be possessed by you. To give you my passion, and&nbsp;surrender my control to you. I can&#39;t wait to feel you inside of me. Filling me. Seeing you over&nbsp;me, watching me come undone in your powerful arms as you control my pleasure. Oh Alexander, please let me come to you tonight,&quot; Hephaestion begged.

Hephaestion was a seducer of men, but Alexander would not surrender to Circe&#39;s call. Only on his own terms.

&quot;Tomorrow night, my love. Not in a field tent. I want our first time to be in the palace, in the kings bed. It is a days ride. Give your orders to your men. We have engineers, Hephaestion. You will ride with me and the kings guard tonight. Tomorrow we will bathe properly, dine together, and have the night to ourselves. We will not have such pleasures for long. We leave soon for Persia. Tell your men you are leaving.&quot;

Hephaestion got to his feet. He loved Alexander&#39;s strength, but he feared his self denial could someday be a problem.

&quot;Yes , my king,&quot; he said giving Alexander a look of passion and submissiveness.

The next night, Alexander was bathed and waiting for Hephaestion. He had ordered a dinner that he knew Hephaestion would enjoy. Raw vegetables, fruits and marinated chicken strips. Rich wine was ready to be drank. He wanted more then just sex for the first time in his life. He wanted to romance Hephaestion. Although he was a little nervous. When he was young he had been watched and directed by both his mother and father. As King his only passion was gaining more land for Greece. He had little experience in the ways of love.

Hephaestion entered and looked at his kings profile, summing up Alexanders emotions before the king noticed him. Alexander looked nervous. Hephaestion would have to subtly guide his lover in order to bolster his confidence.&nbsp;He put a slight look of nervous fear on his face, hopefully mixed with desire. He hoped this would be the last time Alexander had to be coaxed. It was hard to control his emotions around this beautiful blond. Hephaestion was afraid that he was already in love.

Alexander turned when Hephaestion closed the door quietly. He was wearing a blue silk robe, open at the chest, and ending at mid thigh. He had been newly waxed and his skin was bronze silk. His long hair was held back by a ribbon. His face was pure temptation, but it also showed a little fear.

&quot;Why do you fear me, my lovely Hephaestion?&quot;

Hephaestion found that he actually was a little scared. he didn&#39;t have to act. He decided to be honest with his king.

&quot;I do not fear you, Sire. I just.........it has been so long for me. Several months since I have given myself to somebody. I have wanted you since the first moment I saw you. I guess I&#39;m a little nervous of not pleasing you.&quot;

Alexander reached out a hand, his own fear disappearing in the need to comfort his lover.

&quot;Let&#39;s have some wine.&quot;

Watching Hephaestion eat the grapes and melon&#39;s and lick the juices from his fingers was pure torture. He pulled Hephaestion to the bed and kissed him, exploring his mouth. they moved to the middle of the bed, kissing and touching, pulling robes off each others body. Alexander was afraid he was going to spend himself right away when Hephaestion started kissing his way down the king&#39;s chest. He looked up at Alexander .

&quot;Please let me taste you. I&#39;m dying to taste you.&quot;

Alexander reached for Hephaestion and stroked his beautiful face. He reached around and pulled the ribbon from his hair, spreading the soft tresses through his fingers. He lightly pushed Hephaestion&#39;s head towards his groin.

Hephaestion took all nine inches without hesitation. Alexander was very thick, but Hephaestion did not falter. He sucked hard, taking all of him deep, moving his tongue along the vein and mushroom head. It was less then a minute before Alexander was cumming into Hephaestion&#39;s greedy mouth where his essence was eagerly swallowed.

Hephaestion kissed his way back up Alexanders body. He lay on his back and pulled Alexander&#39;s hand over to touch his chest and nipples. He threw his head back in enjoyment. When he felt Alexanders hard on against his leg he wanted more. He&nbsp;maneuvered himself under the king and spread his legs.

&quot;Please Sire, don&#39;t tease me anymore. I need you inside me. Fill me please.&quot;

Alexander who had never taken a man from the front was about to move when Hephastion put his legs on top on Alexanders shoulders, lifting his bottom for the taking. Alexander was enthralled with the exquisite creature. He reached for the oil beside the bed and put a finger inside his lover.He was instantly hard again from just having his finger there. Hephaestion was so hot and tight.

&quot;Now Alexander, now!&quot;

Alexander entered his man slowly, and when he was all the way in, he leaned in to kiss his lover until he felt Hephaestion buck against him. He thrust into his lover building momentum. Hephaestion kept begging to be taken harder and deeper. part of Alexander&#39;s enjoyment was watching Hephaestions face. His head was thrown back in rapt enjoyment. His hands were clenching Alexanders shoulders. He was wanton in his desire and he screamed Alexander&#39;s name cumming all over their chests.

When Alexander felt Hephaestion&#39;s release, he let himself go, and collapsed into his lovers arms. Hephaestion lowered his legs and they clung to each other kissing. They had tears in their eyes. Neither imagining that sex could be that good. They both knew the other felt the same.

Alexander took Hephaestion two more times that night. Once with Hephaestion on his hands and knees. Towards morning Hephaestion rode Alexanders cock&nbsp;until he passed out on his lovers chest. Alexander rolled his lover away to get a towel to clean himself and the young siren sharing his bed. He got back into bed and pulled his exhausted lover into his arms. Hephaestion put his head on Alexanders shoulder, and curled into him. Even though Hephaestion was as tall as Alexander and nicely muscled, he was slim and slight in build. Alexander felt strong holding him and keeping him safe. Hephaestion snuggled closer and Alexander fell more in love.

&quot;Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to have other lovers.&quot;

Hephaestion opened his eyes and looked up to his lover.

&quot;You don&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;I want you to belong to only me. I never want anyone else to touch you again. I will have your promise.&quot;

&quot;And you, Alexander? Are you going to have other lovers? Do I have your promise?&quot;

&quot;You are more then enough for me, my love. Yes, &nbsp;you have my promise.&quot;

&quot;Then you have mine as well.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t stand the thought of anyone else touching you, Hephaestion. I will kill anyone who tries.You are my own treasure to hoard.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, if that should change, if either of us is even thinking of taking another lover, lets talk to each other about it. No surprises.&quot;

&quot;I agree. What kind of friends would we be if we can&#39;t trust each other. But Hephaestion, there will be no other lovers.&quot;

Hephaestion snuggled in even closer.</font></font></div>"

<font size=""3"">Hephaestion had been invited for dinner with Alexander and his companions. For the most part he had been welcomed. But there were a few who did not. One was Philotus who he disliked on sight. The other was&nbsp;Philotus&#39; father, Parminion; who Hephaestion had the displeasure of meeting earlier that afternoon.

&quot;So you are nobody of importance?&quot; Philotus said snidely. &quot;You have no family?&quot;

&quot;I was born with family. But I am alone in the world now. I guess to you I am unimportant.&quot;

&quot;Who is your family?&quot; asked the kindly Ptolemy.

&quot;My fathers name is Amnitor. Nyamnus Amnitor.&quot;

Alexander leaned forward. &quot;Hephaestion, your father served mine. You are a lord.&quot;

&quot;I was, my king.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you did know your father passed on didn&#39;t you? I am sorry to have to be the one to tell you if you didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sire. I did know. But my father and I had little love for each other. And I am no lord. I renounced my fathers holdings years ago. I am just an engineer now.&quot;

&quot;But you could have been at court with all of us.&quot;

&quot;I would have liked to been with you, Sire,&quot; Hephaestion said, seeing Alexander blush, much to his amusement. &quot;But court life was not for me. I would inherit a farm for which I had no love. And a seat at court where I could speak my mind, but have no say.&quot;

&quot;So what did you do?&quot;

&quot;I ran away from home. I left when I was thirteen years old with my lover who was fifteen years older then me. He was a bridge builder from the icy north lands. He taught me my trade. We were together five years before he left to journey home again.&quot;

&quot;Cassander leaned forward. He found this beauty&nbsp;not only mesmerizing to look at, but interesting to listen to.

&quot;Where did you go then, Hephaestion? I know your brother. He is not a very nice man. He has your title. He actually works for my father. I had no idea who you were when we decided we needed a bridge builder.&quot;

&quot;Why would you? I am sure my name is never mentioned. I didn&#39;t go to my fathers funeral. I didn&#39;t even know for a year after he died.. After Sven left, I went to Rome. I stayed there for four years, and built bridges for that empire. I only arrived in Egypt a few months before the army of Alexander.&quot;

Alexander loved to hear talk of the Romans. He was about to ask questions when he heard Parminion speak up. I would seem everybody wanted to talk to Hephaestion. 

&quot;I have heard about the Athenian who was the whore of </font><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Praetor</span><font size=""3"">.&quot;

&quot;Parminion!&quot;&nbsp; Alexander didn&#39;t want anyone called a whore at his dinner table. A guest at his dinner table. He did not want to hear Hephaestion himself called a whore.

Hephaestion just laughed. Amused at the petty man.

&quot;It&#39;s all right Alexander, I know what I am. I have never collected money for sharing my body. My sex life causes great interest to many people.. I&#39;ve probably had no more lovers then anybody here.&quot;

Hephaestion rose from the table, bowing to his new king. &quot;Sire, I leave for your city at first light. I will be in Alexandria for a few days if you have need of me.&quot; He then turned to Parminion.

&quot;Yes General Parminion. The answer is yes. I was the lover of </font><font size=""3""><i>Praetor</i>. I seem to gravitate to powerful men. And as for you thinking I am a whore, it didn&#39;t stop you from groping me and trying to drag me to your bed this afternoon. What did you tell people when they asked where you got the bruised cheek?&quot;

With that last remark, Hephaestion glided from the room.

&#39;Good, let them have something to talk about after I leave&#39;, he thought.</font></p></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"">
<font size=""2""><font size=""3"">Nearcus, Cleitus, Ptolemy, and Cassander were in the kings tent discussing the upcoming invasions of Egypt and Persia. The planning never stopped. Planning the war, surrender, and even the peace that would hopefully follow.. Alexander wanted the roads open for trade, so all of his people could go wherever they wanted. His vision went far.

&quot;The canyons of Persia will slow much of our travel,&quot; &nbsp;Cleitus said. &quot;It may even stop us from going everywhere we want to go in Persia once we are there. The Persians take many months to get&nbsp;from one of their palaces to another.&quot;

&quot;We need a bridge builder,&quot; Ptolemy added. &quot;Our own engineers are hesitant about bridges over those vast canyons.&quot;

Alexander got up and paced. He would not be stopped by a hole in the ground!

&quot;Cassander, you hear everything, who can we get?&quot;

&quot;I know of two people, Sire. An older man from the great frozen north lands. He is a master, but nobody has seen him for a few years. The second man is a Greek. From Athens. He has been an apprentice to the ice man since he was a child. He is very good.&quot;

&quot;Why haven&#39;t I known this? I need to know everything. Where is this man? Go to Athens, that arrogant city, and bring this man to me.&quot;

&quot;He isn&#39;t in Athens, Sire. As luck would have it, he is in Egypt.. But Sire, he will want to be paid a big sum. He thinks very highly of himself.&quot;

&quot;A man is worthy of his hire, Cassander. Nearcus are we still ready to sail in two days time?&quot;

&quot;Yes Sire. Your fleet awaits and is ready.&quot;

&quot;Then we sail to Egypt. This is fate. We will pick up this man there. What is his name, Cassander?&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, his name is Hephaestion. Sire, I have heard that this man is very sensual. He is beautiful and well..... he sleeps with numerous men, my king.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care if he has sex with my entire army. If he is as good as you say, then we need him.&quot;

It was months later before Alexander had time to think of the engineer again.&nbsp; They had taken Egypt, who had not been ready for such an assault. The people making Alexander Pharaoh. He liked Egypt. It was there he began his first city, Alexandria. It was talking to the&nbsp; Egyptian engineers who were building his city that he remembered the bridge builder. They didn&#39;t have a description except that he had been in Egypt for awhile now, he was Greek, and he had a legendary beauty. In the end it was remarkably easy to find him. The search led them to a boarding house. Alexander had decided to go himself, along with Cleitus, and Cassander.

Alexander lifted the flap that was used as a door. It was an open concept room to let the rivers breezes in.

On the bed in the middle of the room, lay a man. A very naked man. The three men stopped and stared.. The man lay on his stomach. Slim and sleekly muscled. His body had been shaved or waxed as these Egyptians did, and his skin was golden and looked like silk. Alexander couldn&#39;t help but gape at the mans bottom. He lay there with his legs spread. His bottom small, but pert and muscled. His long chestnut hair was fanned out over the pillows. All three men were staring so intently at the beauty that they hadn&#39;t noticed the man waking up.

Hephaestion looked at the men amused. He knew who King Alexander was. He had seen him a few times. Hephaestion decided to play.

&quot;Finally, the men I ordered. You two may go. The blond may stay. Take your clothes off, love and&nbsp;jump in bed, I adore blonds.&quot;

For a brief moment Alexander was tempted to do just that very thing. It was Cleitus who acted first. Drawing his sword, he put the tip to the mans throat.

&quot;This is King Alexander of Macedonia, boy. Greece&#39;s king. Egypt&#39;s king. You will be respectful.&quot;

Hephaestion slowly rolled over away from the blade, and again the men gaped. Cleitus even let the blade drop to the mattress. Hephaestion&#39;s chest was nicely muscled, hairless except for a thin treasure trail leading down to a very handsome endowment. His waist was slim, and Alexander ached to span it with his hands. But it was the man&#39;s face that drew rapt attention. A face to rival Narcissus, and Aphrodite. Never had they seen such a jewel. His features were exquisite. Pouty red lips and large blue eyes to match the Mediterranean from which he was born. He had a look of intelligence and a boyish look of innocence. He was a sultry invitation to lustful, sinful pleasures.

&quot;Gentlemen, I have been told that I am pretty. Thank you for staring. It is starting to make me nervous. I am a free man, if you came for a reason, you&#39;ll not get it by the point of a sword.&quot;

&quot;Cassander, Cleitus, please wait outside.&quot;

&quot;My king, I don&#39;t think........&quot;

&quot;Cassander I am fully armed and he is naked. I believe I can handle myself. I don&#39;t think he has any designs on my virtue.&quot;

Hephaestion slowly licked his lips. &quot;Don&#39;t be too sure.&quot;

After the two soldiers left, Hephaestion rose to pour wine for his guest and for himself.

&quot;Could you put some clothes on?&quot;

&quot;Does my body bother you?&quot;

&quot;It distracts me.&quot;

Hephaestion put on a slinky robe. It covered him, but only added to his beauty.

&quot;You need a bridge builder.&quot;

&quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;I have heard of Alexander&#39;s campaign to conquer Persia and India. With my lover gone, I am the only one to get you across the canyons of Persia. I have been expecting you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to conquer. I want to unite the lands. Open them to travel and trade.&quot;

Hephaestion gazed at the idealistic young king with new eyes. He was very handsome and Hephaestion felt stirring in his loins.

&quot;I will join your army. I will need some training to brush up on my fighting skills. And I wish to be paid generously for my bridges.&quot;

&quot;You will be. Alexander stiffened at the thought of this beauty fighting. Getting hurt, maybe dying. &quot;I need you as a engineer,&nbsp; not a soldier. Come gather your things. There is a room for you in the palace.&quot;

Hephaestion lowered his eye lids and peeked up at him through long lashes.

&quot;Can I stay with you?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I would have you as my lover.&quot;

&quot;I am the king, Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;The king has lovers.&quot;

Alexander blushed. He&#39;d had a few quick tumbles, but never a lover.

&quot;You want me because I am king?&quot;

&quot;I want you because you are beautiful and I would like to please you. I want you in spite of you being the king.&quot;

&quot;My generals, my companions would talk.&quot;

&quot;So.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t just take you as my lover. I don&#39;t know you.&quot;

Hephaestion saw apprehension, excitement and a little fear in the kings eyes. He knew when to back away when he was pursuing somebody he desired.

&quot;Call your men in, sire. They can help me carry my things. We can send for the rest. I will stay in the room you have for me.&quot;

Hephaestion took off his robe and put on a cotton wrap around dress in Egyptian style. He stayed naked underneath. He dared a glance at the king and saw lust and need in his eyes. He smiled to himself.

&quot;So what do I do while I am waiting to build your bridges?&quot;

&quot;Maybe you can look at the plans of the city I am building here?&quot;

Hephaestion&#39;s eyes gleamed. He had watched the workers and he had so many ideas and suggestions.

&quot;I would like that very much. I am very good at maps and logistics, if you have need of that, Sire.&quot;

Alexander nodded and the two smiled at each other.

Cleitus and Cassander came in during this last exchange and saw the smiles. They were glad. Hephaestion would make a worthy lover of their king. They looked forward to seeing the sparks fly. Hephaestion was a&nbsp;flirtatious fun loving man, and the king could be possessive and combative. This would be interesting.</font></font>

epilogue</font></p><div class=""ljcut""><div class=""ljcut""><p><font size=""3"">&quot;Hephaestion?&quot; Alexander called, stepping into his lovers spacious rooms.

&quot;I am here, Alexander. This is starting to become a regular thing.&quot;

&quot;I was a fool,&quot; Alexander said, coming further into Hephaestion&#39;s tent, after locking the door.

&quot;I was worse then my father. I can&#39;t believe how much you have taken from me. That you waited so long for me to come to my senses.&quot;

&quot;Yes, well I&#39;m a sucker for fools. It was only time, Alexander. I made the decision long ago to make your dream mine and to help your dream come true.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for delegating your work more often, I have enjoyed finding you in your tent every night.&quot;

&quot;I like being available for you. You have been showing so much appreciation.&quot;

Alexander giggled as he undressed under his lovers beautiful watchful eyes. He got into Hephaestion&#39;s bed and wiggled into his beloved&#39;s arms. &quot;I am sorry I had to be with Roxanne last night.&quot;

&quot;We want a child, Ale. I understand.&quot;

After the last horrific battle,&nbsp;&nbsp;both of them almost losing the other, they had started spending all their free time together. Hephaestion was hearing talk of discord among the kings companions. He was afraid of betrayal and was ever vigilant of the whispers on the wind. But not tonight. His eyes drifted to the flower in the vase beside his bed. Alexander was in his arms. He had started being with Hephaestion more and more. Working hard at mending his lovers broken heart.. In turn realizing that it *was* only Hephaestion that he needed and loved. And it was Hephaestion who only truly loved him.

&quot;Do you have an admirer, my love?&quot; Alexander had noticed the flower.

&quot;Just a dear old friend.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you seem so happy tonight?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Tell me,&quot; Alexander demanded.

&quot;I dreamed of Cleitus last night.&quot;

Alexander stiffened in his arms. &quot;One of my many regrets,&quot; Alexander mourned. &quot;Do you still miss him so much?&quot;

&quot;Oh Alexander, even after all these years knowing that no other person has ever known my body except you, You are still jealous. I like that you think so much of me, even with all my scars.&quot;

&quot;You are beautiful, and I am not jealous. What did you dream?&quot;

&quot;I was standing in a meadow, overlooking a sparkling pond. Your father and Cleitus were laying on a blanket. They had just finished making love. I didn&#39;t see it, but I knew it to be true. They had eyes only for each other. your father no more then thirty and Cleitus still in his teens. No scars. Your father had two eyes. They were&nbsp;so beautiful.&quot;

&quot;They were great lovers once.&quot;

&quot;They always loved each other, Alexander. Your father just acted like a arrogant fool,&quot; Hephaestion said, giving Alexander a pointed look. &quot;They never really had time to come back together like we did. They had to wait.&quot;

&quot;Do you believe in true happiness in the afterlife, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Yes I believe.&quot;&nbsp; Hephaestion repeated the words that Cleitus said to him several years before. &quot;It&#39;s more then just believing. It&#39;s more then just faith.&nbsp;I feel it. I *know* it, Alexander. Love like your fathers and Cleitus&#39;s, like Achilles and Patroclus, like Alexander&#39;s and Hephaestion&#39;s will never die. It is an eternal gift of the gods.&quot;

&quot;When I was in the dream, Ale, I could fell the heat from the sun, smell the grass in the meadow, hear the water running from the stream. I could even hear Phillip and Cleitus teasing each other. Cleitus looked up, looked right at me and nodded. When I woke up&nbsp;I could still feel the heat from the sun on my face. The smell of the grass lingered on my clothes. When&nbsp;I looked over the flower was laying&nbsp;&nbsp;on your pillow.&quot;

Alexander sat up and looked at his lover. He knew there was more to come.

&quot;Alexander, do you remember when you got married, Cleitus and I left to go camping.?&quot;

&quot;Yes I could hardly stand to be with her after that, knowing you were with Cleitus. I was insane with jealousy.&quot;

Hephaestion chuckled. &quot;When we were out in those Bactrian hills there were a bunch of flowers growing along the creek bed. I still have drawings here somewhere. I have never in any place we have ever been seen those flowers. Cleitus and I both have looked. The Persians say they only grow in Bactria. Alexander, the flower in the vase is the same flower that grows along that creek bed in Bactria.&quot;

&quot;What do you think it means?&quot;

&quot;I think,&#39; Hephaestion mused,&quot; that Cleitus was trying to tell us to enjoy what we can here, and to not be afraid. Because in our eternal love for each other we will know peace and happiness. And it will be our greatest reward.&quot;

Alexander looked at Hephaestion&#39;s face and saw the truth and knowledge in his beloved&#39;s
beautiful eyes. And at that moment, so too , did Alexander believe. He leaned over to kiss the other half of his soul, and said mischievouly....</font></p><p>
<font size=""3"">&quot;I guess after I&#39;ve told Cleitus I&#39;m sorry for killing him, we will thank him for the gift.&quot;

&quot;The next time we see him of coarse,&quot; Hephaestion added, blowing out the candles. It was time for them to love.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE END</font></p></div></div>"

part nine</font></p><lj-cut><font size=""3"">On the day of the wedding, Hephaestion stood with the other companions watching the great king marry the barbarian girl. She was hard looking and didn&#39;t have a royal quality to her. But Hephaestion kept these thoughts to himself. It may have been his own jealousy coloring his thoughts.

Finally it was over and he sat with the other generals for a much needed glass of wine. Speeches were given and it was Hephaestion&#39;s turn to toast his life long friend. He did so in Persian as well as Greek.

&quot;My old friends. My new friends. Today is so much more then a marriage. Today we unite our two great empires. Alexander is my best friend, my brother, my king. He has my arm in battle, my friendship, and my loyalty. I welcome my new sister and offer her the same. Drink to our king and his bride. To the happiness and love that the Gods have blessed them&quot;

Hephaestion looked Alexander in the eye during this last sentence. The first time in several days.

&quot;Lastly, my friends, may the Gods grant them many sons to raise together.&quot;

&quot;Hear hear,&quot; Clietus jumped up throwing his great arm around Hephaestion. &quot;to the King and Queen,&quot; he yelled raising his glass. &quot;Let the feast begin.&quot;

Cleitus sat down next to the trembling man. He alone knew what the boy was going through. Cleitus had loved Phillip. Still did. But he had lost his lover to several marriages and even more lovers. Alexander and Hephaestion thought they were prepared for the king to marry. Cleitus could have told them how hard it would be. Hephaestion&#39;s status in the army was the same as any other generals. Yes he was Alexander&#39;s most trusted, but it was not the same. No longer would he share a tent. There could only be stolen moments. No longer would they share a couch and a plate of food. The secret looks and the hand holding under the table would stop. They could no longer share the same glass of wine. Lips touching where the others had been. The cord that bound them together may not break, but it would be stretched very thin. They may always love each other, but there would be a distance. They may find a certain harmony, but never again would there be that all consuming love of youth.

Cleitus loved his king. Alexander was the son of the man he had loved all his life. He would serve him and die for him if need be.

Cleitus had watched Hephaestion grow from a young boy to a fierce warrior. And yet no matter what blows had been thrown at him, he still had a boys wonder of the world. An innocence that could not be denied. And Cleitus loved him for it. Cleitus had seen Hephaestion with the young page. He was glad. Hephaestion&#39;s bed shouldn&#39;t be cold. But Alexander had seen the boy also. Cleitus didn&#39;t think Alexander would ever let Hephaestion stray. His was a selfish jealousy.

&quot;Be strong my young friend. Enjoy what you can in life, be strong through the rest. Our reward comes after we leave this world.&quot;

&quot;Do you really believe that, Cleitus?&quot;

&quot;Love is eternal, Hephaestion. Now what are your plans for the next few days? Alexander will be busy with his bride and his family dinners.&quot;

&quot;Plans? I can&#39;t think past this moment. I&#39; m sure I have many things to do.&quot;

&quot;Let Ptolemy do them. He has gotten lazy.&quot;

&quot;Why&quot;

&quot; I found a beautiful glade a few miles from here. A beauty to match your own,.&quot; he added with a twinkle in his eye. Cleitus was happy when he saw Hephaestion blush.

&quot;It has some old rock formations that I think you will find interesting. And there are these flowers that I have never seen anyplace else. Bring your sketch pad, I know you like to draw flowers. It has a stream where we can fish and swim.&quot;&nbsp; Cleitus looked at Hephaestion. &quot;We go in friendship only Hephaestion. I won&#39;t take advantage of you. I would like to see this place again before we leave here.&quot;

Hephaestion looked wistful. How long had it been since he took a few days for himself to just have fun? Still he hesitated.&nbsp; He looked over to his beloved who was leaning in to listen to something the queen had said. Hephaestion knew sorrow this day.. He lowered his head and peeked up through his long lashes. A flirty move he did because it drove Alexander crazy. Over the years he did not realize he even did it.

He was eager to have sorrows burden lifted from his shoulders and put himself safely in his friends hands.

&quot;He will look for me at first light. Maybe before.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t drink anymore. We will leave after they retire.&quot;

&quot;I have to give something to Alexander when he adjourns . We will leave after that&quot;

Cleitus having the twin stars that were Hephaeston eyes stare at him, and those red lips smile at him, fell a little in love with this very desirable man. Gods, Alexander was a fool.&nbsp; Cleitus would have to watch out, else he would have Phillip and Phillip&#39;s son both mad at him in the afterlife. He grinned a little at that thought. He touched Hephaestion&#39;s cheek.

&quot;I better mingle. I&#39;m getting the kings evil eye. I&#39;ll wait for you in the stable in a few hours.&quot;

Alexander looked across the lawn at his beloved. How he wished Hephaestion was beside him sharing his day. He missed his lover so much. Missed talking and laughing with him. Missed being in his arms, the only place he really felt safe. He saw Hephaestion turn to Cleitus and give him the same look he sometimes gave to Alexander. It was not as lethal as when his lover looked at him, but Alexander knew that look. He saw Cleitus touch Hephaestion&#39;s cheek, and saw his lover lean into the touch. He felt rage and there was nothing he could do about it until first light. He would send a guard to Hephaestion&#39;s room to make sure he was alone. Well really just to make sure Hephaestion was alright. Damn Hephaestion for doing this to him. 

Cleitus and Hephaestion had a boyish good time in the ancient glade. They fished and swam. They studied the rock formations against the sun and the moon and both decided that it was a ancient calender. Hephaestion drew the interesting flowers. He even pressed a couple into his sketch book. They slept beside each other for three nights. In fear of future repercussions they did not have sex, but they did become lifelong friends on that trip.

When Alexander got word that Hephaestion and Cleitus were riding into camp, he stepped outside to greet them. He did not care if his wife watched, or her father, or anybody else.

When the two were beside the king, they got down to greet him. Cleitus inquired about his marriage but was ignored.

&quot;Joy to you, my king,&quot; Hephaestion formally said.

&quot;Hephaestion you will give your horse to Cleitus and you will meet me in my rooms.&quot;

&quot;As you wish, Sire. Just let me bathe and check in with my page.&quot;

&quot;Stefenos has been reassigned to Ptolemys unit.&quot;

&quot;Alexander...&quot;

&quot;Enough,&quot; Alexander roared! It was the kings voice that no one disobeyed. Not even Hephaestion.&quot;General Hephaestion, that was a order.&quot;

Hephaestion gave a sigh and lifted his shoulders. It was unavoidable.

&quot;Did you have fun on your little vacation, commander?&quot;

&quot;I did, Sire.&quot;

&quot;You did not have leave to go.&quot;

&quot;It was the first time off I have taken in years.&quot;

&quot;Not when I am unavailable.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t happen again, Sire. How was your wedding night?&quot;

&quot;Do you really want to know, Hephaestion?&quot;

Hephaestion closed his eyes tight. &quot;No,&quot; he whispered.

&quot;Hephaestion your irrational jealousy caused me to have a terrible start to my marriage. Knowing you were with Cleitus. He has always wanted you.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, all the years we have been together, we have each felt jealousy at the thought of another person being with&nbsp;the other&nbsp;in that way. I have been through that with you and I have survived it. This was not jealousy.&quot;

&quot;What is it then?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fear of loss. Fear of losing a part of myself. I have always thought of you as the other half of my soul. How can I survive if I lose half of my soul?&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t lost me Hephaestion. It is me who is losing you.&quot;

Hephaestion turned his back on Alexander. He did not want his lover to see his inevitable tears.

&quot;I feel such an overwhelming sense of loss. It constricts me. It squeezes my heart. It sits upon my chest and binds my ribs. My pain is so great I fear dying from it. It astounds me that you can&#39;t&nbsp; feel it.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion she is not worth this. I still love you. Do you hear me? I love you. You knew I had to marry. We have talked about it. Prepared for it. Now when the time is here you abandon me. Why? Why Hephaestion?&quot;

Hephaestion turned back around.

&quot;Because you love her! I saw the look on your face when you first saw her. You were not supposed to love her. Only me, you said.&quot;

&quot;You wish me not to like her? To marry someone I couldn&#39;t stand to be with? You wish that for me?&quot;

&quot;No. Yes. I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, you fool. I have to be able to desire her to be with her. It is the only way I could be with her.&nbsp; It is you I want. Always you. You are like fire in my blood.&quot; Alexander reached out to hold his lover.

&quot;But you love her!&quot; Hephaestion said, pulling away.

&quot;Not like you! Hephaestion let me hold you.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion.&quot;

&quot;I love you, Ale. I will follow you everywhere. Anywhere. Just give me a little more time to mourn my loss.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t take much more of this Hephaestion. You Haven&#39;t lost me! I am still here.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, I no longer share the kings chambers. When we get back to Babylon, I have to move out of my rooms that I have had for over two years. I move to the generals wing. We can&#39;t hug in public. We can no longer sleep the night together, waking up to make love before we start our day. I would say I lost a&nbsp;great deal,&nbsp;my lord.&quot;

&quot;I have lost these things too, Hephaestion. It pains me also.&quot;

&quot;It *kills* me.&quot;

&quot;You are the one not willing to work this out. You are pulling away.&quot; ALexander grabbed Hephaestion&#39;s arms and shook him. &quot;Is this about Cleitus? You were with him. By Zeus Hephaestion, did he fuck you? Did you let somebody else inside your body?&quot;

&quot;Yes! I let him take me. You know I like it rough. His cock was so big inside me.&quot; Hephaestion goaded Alexander. He didn&#39;t know why. He knew it was wrong to hurt his king, but he felt so much pain himself, he lashed out. &quot;He fucked me hard. Making me beg and scream....&quot;

Alexander struck him!&nbsp; Slapping him so hard that he fell to the floor, where he stayed weeping.

&quot;He didn&#39;t have me Alexander. We didn&#39;t do anything. He was just a friend.&nbsp; You are the only one I ever want inside me. Oh my love, I am so sorry. It just hurts so much. It&#39;s not just your wife. It&#39;s all the others. It just built up inside me. I miss sleeping with you. Being with you.&quot;

&quot;I miss you too, Hephaestion. As soon as we are out of Bactria, we can be together more. She will have her own tent and she will have to learn to accept us. She is my wife. But you are my beloved. Dry your tears, my love,&quot; Alexander said, lifting Hephaestion to his feet and kissing the hand print on his face. The heat rose quickly. It had been to long.

There was a knock on the door.

&quot;Sire, the queens family await you in the morning room.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be right there. Hephaestion you are my friend, it would be alright if&nbsp;we were to break our fast together. Please come with me.&quot;

&quot;No Alexander. I am not ready for that.&quot;

&quot;Will you come to me tonight?&quot;

&quot;It is to soon. I must go. And you must go also. Your bride awaits you.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, I love you.&quot;

Hephaestion just nodded and left the room. He was still broken.


The journey back to Babylon was hard on Hephaestion. He set his tent up next to his own men. Away from the king and even the other companions.&nbsp; He visited the king, left soon after they made love and concentrated on his work. It was his salvation.

At Babylon, he no longer shared the kings rooms. In order to appear unconcerned, he threw himself even harder into his work. Ruthlessly becoming invaluable to the king and the kings army. When they left Babylon to go to India, Bagoas was ensconced in the king&#39;s caravans. Hephaestion further distanced himself from the king and the kings companions. From the older generals he received snide remarks. From his friends he grew up with he got pity and even some glad smirks. His friends had grown jealous of Hephastion&#39;s ambition, and rise in the army.&nbsp;He was a rock. He didn&#39;t need them. He set up such an elaborate mobile empire that only he could fully understand the work it took to keep it going. He often had to go far and wide from outpost to outpost, catering to the demands of the moving army of Alexander. His pride wouldn&#39;t let himself sit around waiting to be called by his once constant lover.

&quot;Hephaestion I haven&#39;t seen you in weeks. Can&#39;t you delegate some work. I feel like I have to make an appointment to see you.&quot;

Alexander felt neglected. he knew bringing Bagoas would alienate his lover even more. But the boy begged to come. He said he was treated badly in Babylon. Hephaestion hadn&#39;t said anything when Alexander told him. In his arrogance he thought Hephaestion would forgive him before now.. Only Hephaestion just pulled further and further away.

&quot;How silly, Alexander. I am here for you whenever you have need for me. The running of your empire takes a great deal of work and sacrifice.&quot; Hephaestion kept looking at his maps and papers. He wanted to avoid looking at his beloved.

&quot;This has gone on for long enough.&quot; Alexander dropped to knees between Hephaestions legs, turning his lover away from his desk.

&quot;I miss you. When we are together, which is hardly ever, you leave right after. We don&#39;t talk or hold each other. Do you still love me, Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;You know why I don&#39;t come to you anymore , Alexander. Your broken promises spread all over this land. You have your wives. You have Bagoas, you have your other lovers you think I don&#39;t know about. You even took my own page away from me.&nbsp;I feel like you have two objectives, to unite the known world and to see how much pain you can heap upon your old lovers shoulders before he falls under the strain.Hepaestion, saddened, finally looked at his love. &quot;My king I am ever your friend and I will never betray you. But in so many ways we are already lost to each other. I have come to your rooms a few times, when you have not called for me. You have been busy. Always occupied.&quot;

Alexander stood, pacing the room. &quot;You are pulling away from me Phai. What do you expect? I am lonely. It&#39;s you&nbsp;I want with me.&quot;

&quot;Alexander, your tent used to be *our* tent. Your bed, used to be *our* bed. Now I am invited to share something that used to mine. When I do come to you, all I see is our rooms invaded by others. our bed reeks of the sex of your other lovers. If you love me Ale, don&#39;t put me through that. I need you too, you know. You allow me no others. I still want you, and by Zeus I still love you. But from now on Alexander, you come to me. When you need me, I will always be here for you. You come to me, my king.&quot;

&quot;I am here now, beloved. Please let me stay.&quot;

Hephaestion crumbled into his lovers arms. They held each other all night, whispering words of love. but their souls were crying. Their bodies ached with desperation. Clinging to their old love. Fighting the demons that tried pulling them apart. To much in love to let go. To much in pain to make love.</font>

<div class=""ljcut"">
<font size=""3"">it took three months to reach Bactria. There had been some bloody battles along the way as Alexander&#39;s army cleansed Persia of Darius&#39; killers and any rebel forces. They found Bessos in the hills behind Bactria. Just a weeks ride from that city.In the end the man died quietly. The taking of Bactria was easy. It was the last province of Persia to fall and they gave little fight. The city welcomed the army of Alexander the Great.

Hephaestion was so busy he often didn&#39;t have time to eat. With Alexander meeting with chieftains and dignitaries; everything else was left for Hephaestion, even though he often sat beside Alexander in his meetings. Supplies and trade and trade routes had to be planned between Babylon, Bactria, Macedonis, Greece, and Egypt. Protection had to be set up against bandits. His own generals had become greedy and quarrelsome. Hephaestion often had to be&nbsp;ruthless and harsh in his dealings. He had his own ambitions, but it centered on Alexander&#39;s dream of uniting the world. Now he had to get ready for yet another feast, given by yet another chieftain. One where his own daughter would dance for the king.

Hephaestion stumbled to his rooms in the Bactrian summer palace. Rooms that he never used because he always shared with Alexander. He was stunned. Not really believing what he had seen with his own two eyes. Alexander had fallen in love. His Alexander had given his heart to the dancing girl.

Stefenos had been with Hephaestion for two years now. He was a good page. And like half the men in the kings army, he was secretly in love with the gentle commander. Even more so then most because he saw everyday how wonderful his master was. It wasn&#39;t just his stunning looks. He hated seeing the look of defeat in the generals face. Alexander had put it there. Often he saw sadness in his masters eyes and he wished he could do something. If only the general would turn to him for comfort.

&quot;Hephaestion, please my general, is there anything&nbsp;I can do for you?&quot;

&quot;Thank you Stefenos, just help me with my clothes. My only wish is to sleep.&quot;

After Stefenos helped Hephaestion with his clothes, he lifted the covers for him and put him to bed, much like he would his baby brother. 

Hephaestion curled up in a ball and shut his eyes tight as if to keep out the sight of something very scary. He looked like a small boy. He looked so young to Stefenos. So lost and bewildered. Like a part of himself was missing. A part of him was, the page thought.

&quot;This is a new room, Sir. There is a lot of people outside. Can I sleep in here with you.?&quot;

Hephaestion just nodded. He knew his page wanted to offer comfort.

&quot;Go to sleep. Tomorrow will be even worse for me.&quot; Hephaestion didn&#39;t feel like pretending. &quot;He will send for me early.&quot;

&quot;I will be here for you no matter what, my general. Please Sir, you&nbsp;try to sleep too.&quot;

He and Alexander had turned another corner in their relationship. Hephaestion did not think sleep would ever come easy again. Chaos had been busy today.

&quot;Where were you last night,&quot; Alexander demanded while breaking morning fast.

&quot;I had a headache. I slept in my own rooms. You know that since you sent the guards to look for me.&quot;

&quot;I was worried.&quot; Alexander crooned, but his sympathy was short lived in wake of his other news.

&quot;It&#39;s time for me to get married. Our empire is vast and growing. If we are to journey to India we need to start uniting the people. I am marrying that chieftains daughter from last night. Hephaestion I had to tell you first. The others are coming in shortly.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, say something.&quot; The king asked when met with his beloveds silence.

Hephaestion was tongue tied. He couldn&#39;t open his mouth. He was afraid of what would come out once he started.

&quot;Please Hephaestion, you know I love you. This changes nothing.&quot;

Hephaestion snorted. Changed nothing? This changed everything.

&quot;I understand, Sire. Please don&#39;t ask me to talk right now.&quot;

&quot;All right, my love.&quot; Alexander was defiant. he didn&#39;t want to hurt is lover, or lose him. He still loved him dearly. but he felt something for the dancer. Alexander knew not to push. He saw the tight control Hephaestion had over his feelings. Saw the pain in his eyes. He was glad when his companions entered. And glad when they left. In the end they would have no say. They could advise him. But he was king. He would marry who he wanted. Hephaestion was one of the first to leave, stating how busy he was. If Alexander needed him, he would have to seek him out later. Though, he did not think his lover would come to him.

After talking to Roxanne&#39;s father and brothers. Arranging bridal dowries and his own gifts to the families. Greeting envoys. royal dinners, family dinners, and a hundred other things. It was another three days before he was able to see Hephaestion.

&quot;You will come to me tonight, beloved.&quot;

&quot;No Alexander, your brides family sees everything. Better to wait until we leave here.&quot;

&quot;Are you still mad at me?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want this to change everything. I want you with me, Hephaestion. I need you with me.&quot;

&quot;I need you too. my king. But it also needs to be like this right now. For me as well as for you.&quot;

When Alexander was looking down to the ground in thought, Hephaestion gave a fast pleading look to Stefenos, who had been coming up behind the&nbsp;king. Stefenos nodded. Understanding his masters plea.

&quot;I am sorry to interrupt my king. But Eumenes is looking for general Hephaestion. It sounds urgent.&quot;

Hephaestion forced a laugh. &quot;I had better see what he wants, Before he throws a fit. He is such a old women.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion wait!&nbsp; By Zeus, I am always running after you.&quot;

&quot;Sire, the brides father is coming,&quot; Hephaestion whispered.

&quot;I don&#39;t care. I am his king and you are my.....&quot;

&quot;&quot;Ale please.&quot; Hephaestion looked at his&nbsp;king, letting the pain show on his beautiful face for just a moment.

Seeing his lovers anguish, Alexander waved him to go before turning to greet his future father in law. 

It wasn&#39;t supposed to be like this. Hephaestion wasn&#39;t supposed to be this hurt. He was being stubborn in his jealousy. Alexander still loved Hephaestion. Hephaestion was his beloved. But he loved Roxanne a little too, and Hephaestion would just have to accept...... Alexander stopped. Hephaestion knew he loved Roxanne. Hephestion knew had given part of his heart to another. No.

Alexander had to go to his rooms. Such was his guilt and fear.&nbsp; He was worse then his father. He was hurting the man he loved. Granted he had to marry, but he had been blind to Hephaestion&#39;s deep pain. Now he felt it too. The pain of hurting someone you loved. He had to find Hephaestion. Which was easier said then&nbsp;done. Alexander had many commitments, and Hephaestion was even busier the he was. Alexander had been to Hephaestion&#39;s room the last two nights. He left in agony at finding it empty. Fear and&nbsp;jealousy eating at him while he wondered where his lover was and who he was with. He was afraid to ask&nbsp;for fear that Hephaestion would blow up and that would cause their ultimate break up.

Hephaestion knew his lover would look for him. He wasn&#39;t ready to talk. He lay curled up in a pile of fresh straw in the loft of the royal stables. Stefenos was with him. Hephaestion had even started holding the boy, and when his hard on touched the boys bottom, Stefenos pretended to be sleeping. Hephaestion let him pretend. He did not want to have sex with anybody. He still dreamed of Alexander.</font></div>"

&nbsp;part seven</font>

<div class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"">They had found the great king Darius dead. Killed by his own people, and the search was on for Bessos. Patrols left constantly from Babylon. Hephaestion and Alexander in different search parties. Sometimes they met up with each other, but the king and his second in command were always needed in different places. They dealt with being separated and came together in a frenzy after being apart for a month or more at a time. Until the day Hephaestion rode into Babylon a week earlier then his due date. It was a hard patrol. They had been attacked twice from rebel resistance, and Hephaestion had a few new wounds that Alexander would fuss over. He reached the royal quarters and said a quiet hello to the guards at the door, whom he knew. One of them reached out to detain him. Hephaestion saw the saddened look in the mans eyes, and he knew. With a labored breath he went inside, his eyes sweeping the room. On the bed was his king and Bagoas. Oh, how he wished he had stayed in camp. His jealousy flared, but he pushed it down. He remembered Cleitus&#39; pain and anguish when he lost his lover. He didn&#39;t want to lose Alexander.

He watched Alexander plow into&nbsp;the boys buttocks. Bagoas looked like he was someplace else. His face showed no emotion. Even Alexander&nbsp;didn&#39;t have any of the usual emotions he showed when making love. It wasn&#39;t raw and powerful like it was with the two of them. Alexander came. Not in rapture, but a very controlled orgasm. Hephaestion must have made a sound because Bagoas looked over quickly and saw him. Only then did he show expression, tears springing from his eyes, before scampering from the bed. Alexander looked over in anger at the interruption, and then surprise and guilt upon seeing his lover.

&quot;Hephaestion, I.........&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll bathe and sleep in the&nbsp;queens room tonight, Sire.&quot;

&quot;Hephaestion, wait.&quot;

Bagoas had already started the bath water for him. With a whispered &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;, he left the room. Hephaestion undressed himself and slid into the warm water. He was dog tired. To tired to even lift his arms to wash himself. Alexander slid into the tub beside him.

&quot;Alexander, no.&quot;

&quot;Please Hephaestion, I&#39;ll just wash you. You&#39;re trembling. Please let me.&quot;&nbsp; He picked up the scented soap that Hephaestion liked and methodically washed his lover. He noticed bruising and dried blood from new wounds. 

&quot;Was it bad?&quot;

&quot;I lost three men. I got a good lead on Bessos. He is in the Bactrian hills. We will need almost the whole army to go to those wild lands.&quot; Hephaestion still hadn&#39;t looked up. He felt a little lost.

&quot;Hephaestion, I&#39;m sorry. There has just been so much pressure and I&#39;ve been so lonely.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing as much as you are,&quot; Hephaestion said, anger in his words. Alexander sounded so much like a child at times. &quot;I am also lonely.&quot; Hephaestion tipped his head back so Alexander could rinse his long hair. &quot;Maybe I want a lover too, but I won&#39;t tell you who it is because you&#39;ll just take him for yourself.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Alexander shouted, grabbing his lovers face with two hands. &quot;You promised me. You sat in that breakfast room two years ago and you promised me. Nobody else!&quot;

Hephaestion rose from the water like a god emerging from the sea. Even battered and bruised he was so much more beautiful then anybody else. Alexander nearly drooled looking up at&nbsp;the irate lover he had missed so much.

&quot;You promised me too, Alexander. You said &#39;never again&#39;. Do you remember?&quot;&nbsp; Too Hades with Alexander, Hephaestion thought, let him suffer a little. The weary general quickly dried his body and hair and went into his room, sliding into bed. He moaned at how good it felt. He ached so bad. Alexander slid into bed behind him. there were tears in eyes.

&quot;Hephaestion, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do if you take a lover. I can&#39;t take it. Please, I&#39;ll do anything.&quot;

&quot;Shush Alexander. Do you remember what else I told you that day?&quot;

&quot;You said as long as I love only you,&quot; Alexander sniffled. &quot;I do love only you. I don&#39;t love Bagoas, Hephaestion. I...&quot;

&quot;Alright beloved. I forgive you. Just let me sleep now. I&#39;m sore and tired.&quot; And he was tired. Tired of everything. &quot;You can make it up to me tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Oh my beloved Hephaestion, I will make it up to you. Please let me relax you now. Just lay back.&quot; 

Alexander leaned up and gently kissed Hephaestion&#39;s lips. Hephaestion didn&#39;t taste Bagoas on Alexanders lips. At least his lover didn&#39;t kiss the slave. Alexander knew his lover was exhausted, so he quickly got to work. He kissed the tip of of Hephaestion&#39;s erection, and slowly swallowed him whole. Sucking and sliding his tongue around the head. Gods, &nbsp;he loved sucking hephaestion&#39;s cock. It was already pulsing and Hephaestion came into his lovers mouth, Alexander not wasting a drop. He tasted so good. Alexander leaned up and kissed Hephaestion gently, letting him taste himself.

&quot;I missed tasting you. I missed you.&quot;

&quot;I missed you too.&quot;

&quot;Sleep now. my love. Let me hold you. I love you so much. You are my life.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Ale.&quot;

Alexander smiled. Happy and sucure again. He hugged Hephaestion from behind. The incident with Bagoas already forgotten. For him it truly was nothing. He felt a moments twinge at the lie he had told Hephaestion. He would most likely take the eunuch again. But only if he really needed too. He would be more&nbsp;discreet in the future. Sometimes he just felt so lonely. It&#39;s not as if he would ever do it if Hephaestion were with him. In Hephaestion&#39;s innocence he trusted Alexander and Alexander would do his best to make up this most recent pain. With that thought he breathed in his lovers scent and drifted to sleep. Happy to have his beloved in his arms.

Hephaestion felt when his great love fell asleep. He took a deep breath and let everything go. He knew his lover lied to him tonight. Knew that he would take the slave again. And others also. Alexander really felt nothing towards them in comparison to his devoted love of Hephaestion. He didn&#39;t &nbsp;want Hephaestion with anyone else, but refused to see the connection. It did feel good to be in Alexanders arms again. He had missed his lover. Hephaestion drifted into sleep, not noticing the tears seeping from his eyes. Tears were a big part of his life these days.

The next morning they made love. Alexander letting Hephaestion take him twice. They ate breakfast with the other generals in the breakfast room. Cassander and Hephaestion&#39;s return the main topic of conversation. It was decided that Alexander and Hephaestion would lead the main army to Bactria, leaving Nearchus and his men behind to govern Babylon in Alexander&#39;s absence. They would be back well within the year to plan the Indian campaign

Much later, back in the kings rooms, Bagoas was serving dinner to Haphaestion while Alexander was in the bathroom.

&quot;My lord,&quot; the slave whispered, &quot;I am so sorry. I didn&#39;t want this. I wanted you. I am sorry I have caused you pain. He does not love me my lord. It is always fast and with no feeling.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Bagoas, you are most kind. Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes my lord. It is better then being in the harem or being passed around to the soldiers as king Darius used to threaten.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it would be better then that. I never thought about what some slaves go through. I will look into it, and make sure no body is hurt too badly.&quot;

&quot;You are such a good man, Sire.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Hepaestion whispered, &quot;do not call me Sire.&quot;

&quot;You too are Alexander.&quot;

&quot;No. No Bagoas I am not.&quot;

&quot;He loves you so much, my lord. He talks about you all the time.&quot; Bagoas looked at the beautiful blue eyed dream with love. &quot;If only...&quot;

&quot;Not our fate this time around. But we can be friends.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t see how you would want to be friends with me and I won&#39;t push that. But I would like it very much.&quot;

Alexander came back into the room and waved Bagoas away without even looking at him. He sat down on Hephaestion&#39;s lap and preceded to feed him, letting Hephaestion nibble from his fingertips.

&quot;We will leave him here while we go to Bactria. We will share my tent and let the pages care for us.&quot;

&quot;I would like that, Sire.&quot;

&quot;I want this time together with you, Hephaestion,&quot; Alexander said, kissing his lovers secret spot behind his ear.

Hephaestion moaned and leaned into his lover.

&quot;I need you to make love to me, my Achilles. Make me yours again.&quot;

Alexander trembled from the same need for his beautiful lover. He was so lucky to have this mans love. He led him to the bed where both of them cried as their needs were met over and over again.</font></div>"

<lj-cut>
<font size=""3"">Cassander, Ptolemy, and Cleitus were in the baths when Hephaestion arrived.

Cleitus was the first to notice him.

&quot;Trouble in paradise, Hephaestion?&quot;

Hephaestion slipped his robe off and slid into the water.

&quot;Did you know?&quot; 

&quot;Know what?&quot; This from Ptolemy.

&quot;About Nearchus. All the other men?&quot;

The three men looked at each other. None of them wanted their sweet friend hurt.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; Hephaestion could hardly meet his friends eyes.

&quot;Hephaestion, he is the king. Think of how it is for us.&quot; Cassander, ever the kings man.

&quot;We didn&#39;t want to be the ones to bring you pain.&quot;&nbsp; Ptolemy added . &quot;Who told you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve known for awhile. Cratarus and Eumenes take great joy in telling me. Every time.&quot;

&quot;They would,&quot; Cleitus spat. Cleitus motioned for the other two to leave him alone with Hephaestion. He looked at the anguished young man and started his story.

&quot;When I was young, I too fell in love with a prince. He was several years older then I was, but his love for me was as real as mine was for him. He was as you know, Alexander&#39;s father. He was different then. When Phillip became king, we were still in love. It was only us.. Later there were other boys. And even some girls. Unlike you and I, he liked both sexes.&quot;

&quot;I think Alexander does too. What happened?&quot;

&quot;We fought. He made promises and broke them. After awhile I quit fighting. I gave up. I still loved him. I still love him now. But after awhile the pain became to great for me. We had lost what we once had, and we didn&#39;t know how to get it back.&quot;

&quot;Is this supposed to make me feel better?&quot;

&quot;We all sacrifice in service to our kings. If you give up, if you quit, you *will* be sorry. We will all be sorry. You are the keeper of his soul. There is great joy in loving a king, Hephaestion. There is also much heartache and loneliness. That is your sacrifice, my friend.&quot;

&quot;But what do I do, Cleitus,&quot; Hephaestion cried?

&quot;If I could do it all over again,&quot; Cleitus mused,&nbsp; &quot;I would show my king what he could lose. Keep him on his toes.&quot;

&quot;But we have never played games.&quot;

&quot;No games. Just remind him of who you are too him. Keep his interest alive. All lovers do this. Hephaestion, I hope I am wrong; but I think you will feel&nbsp;a lot of pain. I think Alexander will slip up. It is the way of kings. We really do not know what it is like to be them. But love him anyways. Because in the end, you are all he has. I must go. If Alexander finds out I am here with you, he will have both our heads. I am your friend. Come to me if you need to.&quot;


Breakfast was a quiet affair. There was a little talk of Darius and the wonders of Babylon, but the king was subdued. The companion&#39;s were mostly silent. They did not want to upset the volatile king. Most of them knew of the most current fight between Alexander and their fellow companion. They all noticed the surreptitious glances the king threw towards the dining room door. Cleitus witnessed the kings eyes widen with alarm, lust, and lastly anger. Hephaestion had arrived. This did not bode well most of the generals thought. Except Cleitus, who smiled behind his water glass. 

Breakfast had always been a &nbsp;casual affair. Many of the generals wearing morning robes or sleep attire. Not yet dressing for the days work. Hephaestion wore no shirt. Just a little blue silk skirt tied low around his hips, ending at mid thigh. His body had been lightly oiled. His muscles rippled. His skin was tanned and gleamed with youthful vitality. His hair was braided around his head, with one long plait hanging down his back. His eyes sparkled like two large sapphires. He sat down in profile to his king, putting one slim foot upon a stool in front of him. He flexed his leg. His calf and thigh looking toned and shapely.

&quot;Sire,&nbsp;I am sorry I&#39;m&nbsp;late.&quot;

Alexander looked at his incredible lover. He looked so wanton, dressed as he was. Or rather undressed. He had never looked so beautiful. Except that his eyes looked so sad. His lover would forgive him. Most likely already had, since he had&nbsp;known for awhile and didn&#39;t say anything. Alexander would just have to grovel&nbsp;a&nbsp;little bit. He picked up his plate and cup and went to sit beside Hephaestion and amongst his generals.

&quot;Thank you for joining us General Hephaestion.&quot; Alexander resisted the urge of running his hand along Hephaestion&#39;s naked thigh.

&quot;I want to talk about Darius.&quot;

&quot;Do we go after him, Alexander,&quot; Cratarus asked.

&quot;Yes I want you all to take turns with your own units. Send out patrols. Ptolemy, I am sorry, you will have to miss this weeks festivities. As do you Nearchus. You are first patrol. Take your men and divide up. Keep lines open. I thank you my friends for all the glory you have brought to Macedonia and to your king. You have done a great service and you and your families will be greatly rewarded.&quot;

Nearchus who was glad to be going rose and told the king he would be ready in a few hours. He had heard from Cassander that Hephaestion had found out about his night with the king. Ptolemy not to be outdone said he would be ready also.

&quot;Nearchus, Ptolemy, good luck my friends,&quot; Hephaestion smiled up at his friends, his eyes forgiving as he looked at Nearchus.

&quot;Thank you, Hephaestion,&quot; Nearchus said, gently&nbsp;laying a hand on Hephaestion&#39;s shoulder. Hephaestion was a warrior and an excellent commander to his men. He was also a friend to most of them. he patted Nearchus&#39; hand. They both knew they were still brothers. The others soon followed the two generals out. They were eager to start the days festivities in this magical city.

The king sat beside his lover gazing at him. Even though they had sex last night and again this morning, Alexander still ached for Hephaestion. His lover was pure seduction. He was made for sex. There wasn&#39;t anybody who could look upon him and not want him. The king almost felt sorry for the men who got to gaze at Hephaestion and know they could not have what belonged to Alexander. He never wanted anyone to know the euphoria of being loved by this man.

&quot;Who told you?&quot;

&quot;Craterus and Eumenes.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything?&quot;

&quot;I was&nbsp;afraid that you would finally tell me that you had out grown me. That you no longer wanted to be my lover.&quot;

&quot;Oh my beloved, never. You are all I think about. Please forgive me.&quot;

&quot;Alexander know this. Every fear you have of losing me, I also have of losing you. Even more so for you are king.&quot;&#39; 

Hephaestion knelt on the floor before his king. The servants in the hall invisible to him.

&quot;Alexander you don&#39;t have to fear any longer. As long as I am your beloved. As long as you never give your heart to another, I will never seek out anything from another man. I love you. I&#39;ve loved you since the first day i saw you, and that has not changed. I am yours.&quot;

Alexander was humbled. He did not deserve this man. 

&quot;I won&#39;t hurt you any more, Hephaestion. I am sorry I did. I promise I will never love another. Only you, my beautiful treasure. To exquisite for mans eyes. Come let&#39;s enjoy the day together. We may not get many like this. Lets go to our room first so you can change.&quot;

Alexanders eyes devoured his trophy. His beautiful beloved. Hephaestion with his hand held&nbsp; by the kings, followed his lover and his fate out the door.</font></lj-cut>"

part five</font>
</p><div class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"">HEPHAESTION wasn&#39;t fully awake yet when he realized how warm and comfortable he was. He wiggled into the body he was holding. Wrapping his arms around the slim boy, burying his face in the long hair. He loved how the body in back of him followed his movements. What? Long hair? Body in back? Hephaestion&#39;s eyes shot open. The black eyes that were looking back at him were filled with love and a desperate yearning. He leaned his head forward to kiss the pink lips that were pouting invitingly.</font>


<p></p><p><font size=""3"">&quot;Please don&#39;t. We have never had anyone else. I need to be ready for this.&quot;</font></p><p>
<font size=""3"">Alexander</font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Hephaestion turned onto his back and Alexander put his head upon Hephaestion&#39;s shoulder, peering up at him.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">&quot;Why is he here then?&quot; 

&quot;I thought it might be a start. Bagoas, did you enjoy sleeping with us? Holding Hephaestion?&quot; Alexander was still jealous, but his lovers idea might have merit. He didn&#39;t think he could go through with it because it may cause irreparable damage to his relationship.

&quot;Very much my lord. I would like to hold you sometimes also.&quot;

&quot;Mmm I would love to see that,&quot; Hephaestion moaned.

Alexander still jealous gave his lover a look that said *I am king and we will do this my way*.

Hephaestion who loved when Alexanders jealousy made him act like a true royal gave a little shiver.

Bagoas knew when to tread slowly.

&quot;I will see to your bath. my lords.&quot;

&quot;Take your time,&quot; Alexander whispered.

Hephaestion thought that he might be taken roughly due to Alexanders possessiveness was pleased at the softness that Alexander showed him. Kissing his eyes and lips and softly grazing his lips against Hephaestions neck, he kissed the bruises from the night before. Alexander entered Hephaestion slowly, inch by inch. Hephaestion thought he might cry from the beauty of it. His big blue eyes were shimmering like stars with un shed tears. Alexander leaned down and gently kissed him.

Alexander never tired of seeing his lover like this. So pure was his beauty. The wonder on his face as though he were enjoying sex for the very first time. They came together, both of them to awed for words.

When Alexander recovered and could again breath he told his lover his decision.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to have the boy. I don&#39;t want you to want him. I don&#39;t want him either. Why? Why do think we need him? I don&#39;t. Why do you?&quot; Alexander was close to tears. He lay awake most of the night. He hated seeing the eunuch in his lovers arms.

&quot;Alexander calm yourself. If you don&#39;t want him, that&#39;s fine. You are more then enough for me.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you start this?&quot;

&quot;Please baby don&#39;t push this. We will just forget it.&quot;

&quot;No! Push what? I need to know.&quot;

Hephaestion sighed. The time had come to talk. The reality of it was so painful, but he couldn&#39;t hide from it any longer.

&quot;I know about the others Alexander.&quot;

His king tried to act innocent. He tried to act like he didn&#39;t know what Hephaestion was talking about. But he failed. He never could hide from Hephaestion.

&quot;There are several people who delight in telling me who you sleep with when I am gone. Who and when. I figured if I picked a constant lover then at least I know who you are with when I am away. I don&#39;t have to lay awake and alone in my bed and wonder which one of our men, or which one of my so called friends you are fucking! And listening to your lies when I return.&quot;&nbsp;Hephaestion&#39;s bitterness rose to the surface.

&quot;They didn&#39;t mean anything,&quot; Alexander cried tearfully. &quot;It wasn&#39;t memorable. I didn&#39;t even enjoy it. It really didn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;

&quot;Then why do it Alexander? It means something to me. I have kept quiet for so long. Living with this pain. Thinking that I am not enough for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh my darling you are more then enough for me. I don&#39;t want anybody else. I am so sorry for hurting you.&quot;

Hephaestion got out of bed and put a robe on. There was a story here. He knew Alexander. And he knew something was going on. 

&quot;Alexander&nbsp;I don&#39;t understand.&nbsp; The men I know about were all men who I think are handsome, not you. When we have talked about men, these are the men I expressed an interest in.&quot;


Alexander wished he could turn back time. Take back the things he had done.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t stand that you wanted these men. I figured that if I bedded them and you found out, you wouldn&#39;t want to.&quot;

&quot;Oh Alexander.&nbsp; I never wanted to lay with anybody else.&quot;

Alexander reached out to his lover. Hephaestion pulled away violently, making Alexander cringe.

&quot;So anytime I look twice at a man, anytime I notice a mans hair, or admire &nbsp;his body, are you going to have him? Are you Alexander? Are you going to take Bagoas?&quot;

&quot;No I swear it. Hephaestion, please. I am so sorry. They didn&#39;t mean anything. I won&#39;t do it again. I don&#39;t want anyone else.&quot;

Heph put his hands over his face. 

&quot;How can I trust you? I don&#39;t think&nbsp;I can handle if it happens again.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t, I swear it.. I promise it won&#39;t happen again.&quot; Alexander was getting worked up. His Hephaestion was pulling away just like he always feared, and it was his fault. &quot;Please my love. Please believe me. I love only you.&quot;

&quot;I know. Hush now. You have to meet with your generals to discuss &nbsp;Darius. And there are festivities today and tonight.&quot;

&quot;Are we all right Hephaestion?&quot;

&quot;Not yet. I need time. But we will be. I will bathe in the main baths. I&#39;ll meet you in a while.&quot;

&quot;No! Hephaestion stay here. Bathe and leave with me. I don&#39;t want you to be alone right now. You&#39;re vulnerable.&quot;

&quot;Alexander I&#39;m not going to desire someone in the half hour we are away from each other. You try not to want the eunuch. Remember your promise.&quot;&nbsp; Hephaestion swept from the room, grabbing clothes along the way.

&quot;Oh Hephaestion.&quot; Alexander whispered.</font>

"event","<p><font size=""3"">Loves Reward<br />part four<br /><br /></font></p><div class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"">ALEXANDER&nbsp; HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THE ENTRANCE OF HEPHAESTION. HE SAT<br />alone on his couch.The kings life was sometimes a solitary one. His men had all come over one by one to say hello. And once in awhile one or another would yell out to him. But unless Alexander got up and joined in, they left him alone. But Alexander was content to watch. He didn't join in the drunken revelry like his father did. He knew that Hephaestion would circle the room before coming to him. He would talk to all the men. They all loved him. Very few were jealous of the role he had in Alexanders life. They knew it was hard for him sometimes. He was their brother, and whenever one of them had a problem, it was Hephaestion they came to.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander saw Bagoas enter the room and unobtrusively circle around the back to stand behind Alexander. He reached over to pour his king some more wine and asked him if he was hungry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'll wait for Hephaestion. Did you make him pretty?"" Alexander laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""See for yourself, my Lord,"" Bagoas nodded to the doorway.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The room had been illuminated with hundreds of candles, and there stood Hephaestion with a halo of light around him. Alexander leaned forward drinking in the splendor of his lover. Hephaestion's beauty could rival any in the world. Almost everybody in the room stopped for a moment to stare at Hephaestion, and then looked at Alexander to see if he had noticed. Hephaestion's long chestnut hair glistened in the light, and was trimmed in such a way that it bounced around his face and shoulders. The kohl around his eyes made them look like twin blue stars.He wore&nbsp; light blue&nbsp;diaphanous pants, the material so thin and light that they clung to his body. Alexander&nbsp;grew hard from just looking at him. He wore a white robe threaded with silver and blue. Open in the chest, only held together by a thin silver chain linking one side to the other. Alexander watched as&nbsp;Nearchus gave him a tankard of wine and chatted with his lover. Hephaestion slowly went around the room. Talking to his men, flirting lightly with the pages, making them blush at the attention of the beautiful general. He talked with the Persians. Honoring them by listening. He stopped to hug Ptolemy and Cassander. Cassander not letting go for several moments, much to the enjoyment of the others. Cleitus wanted a hug also. Alexander tensed. Hephaestion had always liked Cleitus a little to much. He watched them hug and kiss lightly. He was about to rise when he felt Bagoas hand on his shoulder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; When Hephaestion reached Alexander, he bowed very low to his King, kissing his ring before he stood and took his place on the couch beside Alexander.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Joy to you Sire. Thank you ,Bagoas."" he said to the servant as he was handed a fresh glass of wine. Hephaestion who suspected that his King had not eaten looked to the buffet tables. ""Please fix us a couple of plates, my dear. The King first. A little bit of everything. Then myself. and we want you to eat as well. Do not make yourself sick.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bagoas almost wept. Nobody had ever cared for him before.""Yes Sires. I'll be right back.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander turned to the entertainment in front of him. Content now that Haphaestion was by his side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost all the boys and women in the harem turned out to be dancers and performers. Bagoas included. Later he gave a much appreciated dance. There were people who planned everything. All Alexander had to do was tell somebody what he wanted. He would have to be careful. An exotic life like this could ruin a man. There were couches and chairs set up all around the entertainment floor. Tables of wine and food arround them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All the men ate and drank. yelled good natured at each other.The dancers were happy to be kissed and pawed by his men. Many were also happy to be led away for private entertainment elsewhere. It was a joyous celebration for all. Alexander gave long thankful speech for his Macedonians, and a shorter one for his Persians. He was loved and hailed by all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion whispered to Bagoas to ready their room for sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander stood up. ""My friends, the party will go on for several days. There will be festivities in the town square tomorrow afternoon. I Hope you can all join me, a cheer went up from his men. The women and boys of the harem will be happy to entertain you. But only with their consent. They are under my protection. All but Bagoas and the Royal family may attend you. We will break our fast at noonday tomorrow. I would like&nbsp;to see my Companions in private so please try to be here. Good health my friends,"" Alexander then led Hephaestion from the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; After they washed and used the&nbsp;bathroom, both of them marveling at the rustic utilities in the palace, they met beside the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Shall I attend you, my lords?"" Bagoas asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the blue eyed god who answered. ""No Bagoas I will attend our King. Get some sleep. We were proud of you tonight. Good health.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I will see you in the morning, Sires. Good night.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""&nbsp;I'm still not comfortable with the thought of him in our bed,""Tion.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Then we will wait for when you are. And if you never are then that's alright, my love. All I have ever wanted was you."" Hephaestion said, leaning over to kiss his lover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""How can we pleasure him? I mean they cut his..... I wouldn't want to just use him.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He can still feel his skin.He can still feel here,"" Hephaestion patted his heart. ""When you let me inside you,&nbsp;Alexander, you know how good it feels.&nbsp;You know it drives me crazy when you move inside me. They did not cut him there. I am glad you are thinking of this my love, But right now I wish to feel you inside me. And if you let me after that, I wish to be inside you. Please Alexander, I need you.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander slipped between the cool sheets, pulling Hephaestion with him.&nbsp;""You never need to ask. But you take me first.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion kissed down Alexanders neck and took his manhood into his mouth. Sucking until&nbsp;Alexander begged to be taken. He then gently entered his lover with his&nbsp;fingers to be followed with his large organ. He made love to Alexander gently. Kissing him and bringing him to slow orgasm. His&nbsp;lover was always a little skittish when being taken. He was scared of his own reaction. After, he gathered his beloved in his arms to hold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I love you, my Achilles. You are a great man. You are destined to become the most powerful king the world has ever seen. I don't know what I will do when you have others you love. And I will be just a fond memory.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""They all look at you, Hephaestion. Their eyes follow you. I'm the one who should worry.""<br />Alex leaned up and over his lover. ""It's a good thing we are together. We both think the other is the greatest thing in the world.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion ground his groin into Alexander. ""Yes who would fuck me like you do. Whose cock could fill me like yours.""&nbsp; Hephaestions pretty lips could be so vulgar. It was hard to imagine that angelic face being so lustful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander grabbed his hands and held them hard above his head. Their would&nbsp;be marks on his wrists tomorrow. Alexander liked when Hephaestion carried his bruises. Marks&nbsp;that branded this beautiful man as his.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You will never let another man touch you! I have told you before. Turn over!"" Alexander grabbed his hips and flipped him hard. He pulled Hephaestion up to his hand and knees and pushed his knees far apart. Alexander poured oil onto his finger and entered&nbsp;his lovers body. Hephaestion pushed back onto the fingers begging for more. Demanding more<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I will please you in my own time. You belong to me!"" Alexander pulled out and spanked&nbsp;Hephaestion ten times on his upturned buttocks until he was rosy red. Then he slammed his cock smoothly into the man below him. Hephaestion threw his head back and howled. Alexander&nbsp;was shaking as he held Hephaestion still so that he could get used to his invasion. He pulled his hair back so he could lick his neck and ear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Fuck me, Ale. Please move.""<br /><br />&nbsp;Hephaestion was never so beautiful then when he was being taken. His face betrayed his great joy in being in Alexanders bed. His face full of wonder as if it was the very first time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander pushed his shoulders down to the mattress and did as&nbsp;his Phia begged. He pounded into his&nbsp;blue eyed devil with long powerful stokes. Pulling almost all the way out, before slamming back in again. Hephaestion pushed himself back to meet every stroke. He cried and begged for release. He was wanton in his passion. When Alexander knew Hephaestion was going to come he reached around to fist his lover and to catch his seed. Hephaestion cried his release. Only when Alexander felt the tremors of his lovers orgasm did he spend himself, deep inside his lovers body. He collapsed onto&nbsp;the back of his beloved who had passed out after such a powerful orgasm. He looked over to see Bagoas coming towards them with a bowl of warm water and a towel. He must have been watching or listening. Alexander didn't care. They must've looked wonderful together. He would've watched too.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He is splendid, is he not?"" Alexander asked after cleaning Hephaestion and himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You both must surely be Gods , Askander.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander smiled at his name.""Would you like to sleep with us,Bagoas?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Very much. Thank you, my lord for allowing me to serve you.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Hold him from the front them. He loves to be held. He has night terrors&nbsp; sometimes. My Love has paid a high price to be next to me.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""We will keep each other safe, Sire."" Bagoas crawled into the bed with his masters. He lay facing the beauty. One arm curled between them, the other wrapped around his waist. Bagoas wanted to smell this man's skin. He was intoxicating. Maybe reach out and lick him,&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Alexander curled in behind him. One arm curled under his pillow, the other arround his waist beside the arm of Bagoas. Hephaestion's ass was warm from the spanking and the hard fucking. He gently leaned into the warm cheeks and smiled when even in his sleep, his lover pushed back.Today was a good day, he thought. Just before succumbing to Morpheus himself</font></div>"

<lj-cut>
<font size=""3""> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bagoas entered the room quietly. His new lords were entwined on the bed. The new king was like a beacon of light with his golden hair. But it was the blue eyed one that Bagoas yearned for.He had heard what the general said to his sire, and he hoped that the king would be acceptable. Meanwhile he would serve them well and not do anything else to anger his new king. He had gotten carried away touching blue eyes in the bath.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My lords, do you wish for me to lay out clothes for your feast? Your Macedonian clothes have been laundered. Or we have excellent Persian attire if you so wish.&quot; Bagoas had in mind what clothes he would like to see them in.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Persian Bagoas,&quot;&nbsp;the king answered. &quot;But first come here. Come onto the bed boy. Hephaestion would like to talk to you about something. His words are mine, for he too is Alexander.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion curled up around his king. His body felt wonderful from the kings possession earlier. He reached out with one hand and held the boys hand. &quot;Did you love the last king Bagoas?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I served him well as was my duty, Sires.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That was not what&nbsp;I asked,&quot; Hephaestion frowned. &quot;We will never be mad at your answers my new friend, as long as you tell the truth. Did you love king Darius?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No my Lords. He ordered my body to be cut, and I was taken away from my family. I did not love him.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How would you feel about serving us? About tending us when we are together and when duty demands that we separate. To keep your ears open and take care of us. And later when we are used to each other sometimes share our bed.. Can we trust you? Your will is you own. You don&#39;t have..........&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sires,&quot; Bagaos interrupted, &quot;I want nothing more then to serve the great King and his............&quot; 

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;i am second in command of our empire. I help rule the armies and do what I can to make our rulers life easier.&quot; Hephaestion said. &quot;I am also his lover. I too serve the King, Bagoas. Alexander comes first in everything.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Enough.&quot; Alexander ordered. &quot;You will call us by our fist names when in these rooms. You will serve only us now. We will get to know each other. You will make the Queens sitting rooms your own. Hephaestion does not need them. He has his own office space and he can share my sitting rooms. Prepare us for celebration!&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lay down my Lords. I will massage a warm lotion into your bodies.&quot; He them proceeded to rub a sandalwood and minty herb into the skin of the King. Alexander groaned under the administration. His body ached and this felt so good. Maybe Hephaestion had been right to bring this boy into there life.&nbsp;Bagoas rolled Alexander over and did his chest and the front of his arms and legs before turning to Hephaestion. For Hephaestion he used a citrus smelling lotion. He dared not get too familiar. and willed his body not to react.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you wish me to shave you and do your hair, Sires?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A shave for both of us, and do something with &#39;Tions hair,&quot; Alexander teased. &quot;Please remember our names Bagoas.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Bagoas led them to chairs in the bathing area where he began to shave their faces, putting a light lotion on their skin when he was done. He then, to the surprise&nbsp;of both of them cleaned their teeth.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I t is easier for me to address you as such when I am speaking to the both of you at the same time. When I am talking to just one of you I will say your names. Is that alright, Sires?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander frowned not sure about the boys boldness. But Hephaestion laughed at his spirit. &quot;That&#39;s fine Bagoas. Please lay out our Kings clothes out for him before you &#39;do&#39; my hair. You should get to the celebration,&nbsp;my love. The men will be waiting. I will follow along shortly with Bagoas,&quot; Before Alexander could protest Hephaestion pulled him into his arms and kissed him thoroughly. their breath minty.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don&#39;t be long,&quot; Alexander turned to don the rich burgundy tunic that reached past his knees. It was embroidered with an intricate design and threaded with gold. On his feet he wore cloth slippers with gold laces that were laced up his calves. Hephaestion gasped when he saw how wonderful his king looked. Alexander was the most handsome man he knew.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander smiled when he saw Hephaestion&#39;s look. His pride restored, he arrogantly told them to hurry and swept from the room.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Long used to his lovers temperament, Hephaestion laughed.&quot;Trim me and dress me Bagoas, we dare not keep his Majesty waiting.&quot;</font></lj-cut>"

&nbsp;&nbsp; The parade was like a dream of glory for King, generals, and soldiers alike. Never could anyone imagine this. What a wonderful world they had won. Later when Alexander and his companions walked into the harem, there was an embarrassed moment, until heat and lust took over. It was Hephaestion who first noticed the boy. Alexander, who had never seen lust on his lovers face for anybody but him was hit hard with jealousy. The boy was lovely. but not as lovely as Hephaestion. Alexander had no need for anybody else, no matter how pretty the package. Did Hephaestion? Was he going to lose his lover to the surreal glitter that was Persia?

&nbsp;&nbsp; When the princess had left with her people, Alexander thought about the look he saw on the boys face. Joy when he thought that Hephaestion was king. Disappointment when he realized that&nbsp;he wasn&#39;t. So the boy had noticed Hephaestion too.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The palace clerk is readying rooms for you all,&quot; Alexander told his men. &quot;And places for our people also.&nbsp;&quot;Please join me tonight for celebration. I must decide what to do with the harem, but for now they belong to me.&quot; Alexander saw Hephaestion look at him quickly. Good let him wonder.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If you need help deciding.........&quot; Ptolemy offered.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Thank you my friend. You will all be rewarded. Do not worry.&quot; Alexander noticed a look between his lover and the boy. This would stop now. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hephaestion please stay. Our rooms are ready. The old Kings and Queens rooms,&quot; He said loud enough for all to hear. His friend was embarrassed at the queen remark. Next time he would remember who he belonged to. Just to make sure Alexander pointed to the boy that had caught his beautiful &nbsp;lovers attention. [If he knew where the boy was then he didn&#39;t have to worry where Hephaestion was].

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What is your name Boy?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bagoas, Sire.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Attend us, Bagoas. Do you understand Greek? Good. Please have the large bath filled for us.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, my king,&quot; the boy answered, bowing several times before turning to go to the kings chambers.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander turned to the women and boys of his new harem and spoke in flawless Persian that&nbsp;he and Hephaestion had both &nbsp;learned. &quot;Please tell us of any mistreatment. Do not fear. We will treat you fairly.&quot; Alexander then took his beloved&#39;s arm and pulled him from the rooms.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion was angry. seldom did Alexander treat him as a possession. They planned the Alexandria campaign. Built the city together. Planned the Persian invasion together. Every little detail. His confusion was evident when he looked at his King. Sometimes because of who they were he had to let things go. &nbsp;Alexander was always king.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander took his sweet &#39;Tions hand and pulled him forward. He brought Hephaestion&#39;s head forward to meet his lips. &quot;Do you like our rooms, my love?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion looked around the kings rooms. There was a large desk and shelves full of scrolls. Comfortable chairs and couches that Hephaestion couldn&#39;t wait to make love to his king on. The bed was high and thick. Big enough for five men. Judging by the old Kings harem Hephaestion had no doubt the old king had made use of the large bed. He didn&#39;t want that thought in Alexanders head. Never the less, the blankets looked soft and clean. A wool and cotton blend. The doors to the balcony were open with a soft breeze blowing in. There were doors leading to a small sitting room that also opened into the queens or rather,&nbsp;his rooms. Smaller, but just as&nbsp;luxurious.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think&nbsp;we can be happy here for a long while, Sire.&quot; Hephaestion kissed his lover again before turning to into the bathing room.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Bagoas was pouring a scented oil into the steaming water.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Shall&nbsp;I help bathe you, my lords?&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander nodded slightly and turned to undress his lover befere stripping himself. Together they slipped into the water. Their bodies ached with fatigue and battle weariness. They both moaned at how good the water felt. Bagoas knelt beside Hephaestion silently asking permission to wash him.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The King first,&quot; the blue eyed man scolded

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Of course.&nbsp;I am sorry my lords. Bagoas lathered the Kings short hair, tipping his head back gently to rinse. Without hesitation Bagoas washed the Kings private parts and the rest of his body. The slave was gentle. But he was fast and thorough. Hephaestion&#39;s eyes burned with lust from watching his lover&nbsp;being touched by the boy he had unexpectedly desired. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; When the slave turned to Hephaestion, the king tensed. The boy washed his hair first. Wetting and lathering the long locks. Rinsing and adding a citrus oil so he could comb through the long strands. Then he started to wash the mans body. Slowly, like he was enjoying it. Bagoas sponged the mans back and lower to his cheeks and in between the cleft. He then turned to Hephaestion&#39;s chest and arms. He washed his shapely legs and tired feet. He saved the Generals manhood for last, and washed gently until he was fully erect.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Aleaander lunged forward to stop the seduction of his lover. &quot;Enough, get out!&quot; Bagoas ran from the room. Alexander&#39;s eyes blazed with jealousy and the selfishness of possession. He grabbed Hephaestions arms and shook him. &quot;Are you happy now?! Did you enjoy his touch? Did you? You are mine!

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Always,&quot; his lover answered. &quot;Take me to bed and make me yours again.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander stood up, pulling his lover with him. Water ran down there bodies. Alexander dried himself quickly and then passed a towel over Hephaestion. Hardening like he always did when touching his lovers body. They kissed, hungry for each other. Hephaestion lay down on his back and spread his legs.&nbsp; Alexender the anger suddenly leaving his body, cried into his beloved&#39;s neck.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can&#39;t take it &#39;Tion. I can&#39;t take that you want him.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I want him for us,&nbsp;Alexander. For us. We have to separate often. He&#39;s someone we can trust. I feel that. He&#39;s someone we can both have sex with because he will love us both.&quot; Hephaestion caressed his kings cheek.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He didn&#39;t even look at me,&#39; Alexander pouted. &quot;He only has eyes for you.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He can&#39;t help but love you. You just scared him. You can&#39;t be jealous Alexander! You know how much I love you. You are my life.&quot;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I need to think about this. I don&#39;t want you touching him. Promise me &#39;Tion that you will remain faithful. I will kill anybody that touches you. You make everybody mad with desire.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion didn&#39;t promise , but he hugged his lover to him and bitterly added &quot;I&#39;m the one who should worry. You are King and you own a hundred beautiful boys and women in your new harem.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander loved when his lover was jealous. It happened so rarely, and&nbsp;it made him hard. Alexander was still slightly oiled from his bath. Before Hephaestion realized he had pushed into his lovers opening. Hephaestion arched his back and screamed. Alexander kissed him until he calmed. Then he pushed His lovers legs on his shoulders and mastered the man.</font></div></div></div>"

He turned back to his men. The victory was his.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The clean up of bodies of dead and wounded was already under way. Alexander knew that Hephaestion would already be directing a hospital tent and doctors to the front lines. The last time he had seen his friend, Hephaestion had been fighting two Persians. Alexander looked for his friend and lover of seven years. He heard the moans and screams of the people. Mostly Persian. All &nbsp;would be cared for They were his people now. He saw Cassander lifting along with Cleitus the body of a young soldier and taking him into the makeshift field hospital. Alexander went inside the tent to offer what little comfort he could to his people. He hated this part. Their was nothing glorious about this aspect of war. When he left an hour later, he finally spotted his lover on his knees giving a dying Persian a drink of water. </font><p><font size=""3"">&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Tion please let the doctors see to your wounds.&nbsp; You saved my life again today."" Alexander said, lifting his tired friend off the ground.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Where are you hurt?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Just a&nbsp;couple glancing blows. I'm alright my king. Darius got away?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Yes. we will go after him though.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion&nbsp; reached out to touch his Sires cheek. Love blazing in his eyes.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You were the true son of Zeus today, my King. I am very proud of you.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""And I you, my love."" Alexander said softly back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Hephaestion!"" Cleitus bellowed. ""Get to the healing tent now! Or there will be no private party&nbsp; between you and your king if you bleed to death!"" Cleitus laughed at his own joke. Long since immune to the horrors of war that surrounded them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hephaestion and Alexander shared a smile. Cleitus would never stop telling them what to do. Even though Alexander was king. He had promised Alexander's father he would take care of his boy and that's what he was going to do.&nbsp; Hephaestion too, since he and Alexander were as one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""There is much to do before your march into Babylon."" Hephaestion said. "" Cleitus, please do something about the wounded horses. Where is Milos? Are all the Generals alright?"" Hephaestion asked questions to anybody around him, even as he was walking towards the the tent. This time Alexander and Cleitus shared a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He is very tender hearted."" Cleitus mused.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""It's what makes him a good leader.' the king replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I hope it's not what breaks his heart,"" Cleitus predicted as he watched the sore yet graceful body of Hephaestion walk away.. ""Well done, Boy,"" Cleitus cried, slapping Alexander on the back before walking away to see about the horses as Hephaestion had asked<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander watched him go. Aware for a long time that Cleitus was in love with Hephaestion. So were several of his generals and close companions, and soldiers, and pages. Almost everybody loved Hephaestion. There was a long list of men who would gladly have Hephaestion if he were ever stupid enough to lose the love of his long time friend and lover.<br /><br /></font></p></div>"

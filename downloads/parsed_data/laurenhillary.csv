"event","New Orleans is bleeding again
Such a shock to most
I could see you through the haze
Remember how I wished you'd wait
Cuz life has dealt every card to your advantage
I watch you dominate the game
Now I wonder, If I was shuffled anything at all
I've built my life around this city
Watched it wake slowly in the late hours
Was there something in the lights?
That created this blind robbery
Now I'm sucked in by the laughter
Deserted by this change
Why am I pulled straight to your eyes?
Their ruby glow, drowned in fame
I can't remain your faithful tourniquet
My ego can't recover
So watch the bayou, it's gentle shimmer
Lay down your ace of spades
This is tranquil
This ruin of all I am
I'm sorry, I cannot be your friend
I'm called elsewhere,
cuz
New Orleans is bleeding again.

"event","I tell myself that it's not fair for me
To see you while knowing
that I can't stop this spreading hiatus
I know what I have to do
But the light is telling, reminding me...
Of the risk that I'm taking
The equal chance of falling apart
into the open arms of lonliness
That I know and can feel all too well
The knife of regret is sharpening,
preparing me for a certain awakening
I'm face-down on the ground
Praying that you can feel my seemingly silent plea
For you to end this, to express-
Where your heart is sending you
Either way, my star-crossed path is
destining me to fall
Into you or to despair
Catch me, Kiss me
For my heart is waiting, crying
That you will turn your head and ignore the smoke-
To hear my heated call...
""What tho the odds be great or small."""

"event","Aaaah well it's 1:02 in the afternoon and I actually decided to update my journal today...and not with a dumb quiz or 5-word entry.  Yeah so ladies & gentlemen, enjoy...
Tonight may be the array of one of two events.  I might go to the fair with Carolyn...or I might to go Olean to see The Notenook with the crew.  I don't know which yet, so I'm still deciding.  School starts in 24 days.  Aaaaah...I canot express how badly I just want this Summer to continue.  The worst thing about next year is going to be that fact that I have to get up at 6 every morning.  Man...I swear, I'm gonna die.  I did the usual routine of talking to Kelly until the wee hours of the morning last night.  I miss her sooo much.  I say that every day, and I don't see a reason to stop now.  I really wanna go to the school in South Carolina with her next year but it's way too late and it would just be easier for me to stay here for my sophomore year.
Carolyn leaves in like 2 weeks tog o to Lock Haven,and Val leaves on the 15th.  I'm gonna miss them so much.  I don't really like to be all alone in my house.  It's really weird without always haveing Cari to talk to.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to stick it out like I did last year.
My new favorite movie is Finding Nemo.  It's so awesome.  I love fish, they're cool.  Finding Nemo is jsut the best movie ever.  I don't know what else to say, I really don't.
Anyways, I'm getting ready to burn a cd with all the Something Corporate songs that arent's on their albums.  It's a total of 20 songs and it's gonna be great.  all their really good stuff is Underground. =)
Anyways, there's not too much more to say other than the fact that I'm going to Erie tomorrow with Carolyn to Waldameer and to get a head start on school clothes.  It's gonna be good, cuz me and Car haven't had a road trip in quite a while.  
So I'll talk to everyone later, and have an awesome day.

btw, leave comments...if you're reading this- COMMENT, it's the least you could do. ;)"

Tomorrow is kingdom bound at darien lake and i severely don't wanna go.  Like I REALLLLLY don't want to.  but my mom is forcing me, so I will be tortured into going.  I just burnt the AAr cd, and got the cool soco cd yesterday so I'll be severely entertained the whole way up.  Yay, then it won't be so bad.  Taking Back Sunday may save my life as well.  
Anyways, how is everyone?  Not that much has happened.  I went to Olean with Brandon, Fleedix, and Val last night and it was fun.  But I had a horrible headache on the way up and I puked onthe side of the road.  Then ym awesome boyfriend went to buy me Motrin from Walmart...isn't he a sweetie?  yesss...And we were gonna go see The Village but it was sold out.  So we ended up buying the movie GIA at sam goody.  It was retarded in my opinion...but apparently everyone loved it.  Oh well, I'm just very....square.  
Sarah just called and is on her way to get the movie GIA and take it to her house to watch with some people...man o mna, ok the movie sucked?  Obviously no one knows that...Oh well, I still love ya Sarah...Tell Wistopher I say hi.  Because he's adorable and totally my husband.  Come on, the cat slept on my chest man...what an awesome feline.  
Anyways, before this gets totally pointless...I'm gonna jet.
Might I add that I saw Lizz today at Costa's and it was awesome!  She's the best lol...ttyl everyone*

wish me luck to the sufferage of tomorrow...aaah =("

I miss Kelly a lot and it's really gonna suck when she leaves.  It's bad enough having her in WV all Summer, and when she goes to BLS it's gonna be like my best friend is totally removed from my life.  Aaaah what am I gonna do?  I definitley will have to visit you Chami, and I love you soo much cuz you're such an awesome person and completley the best friend I've ever had.  We're gonna stay best friend wherever you go, ok? =(
Erikka is also one of the coolest people ever because she burnt me a mix of Taking Back Sunday.  Awesome, huh?  And she bought me a ring and gives me clothes.  She is so awesome to talk to, and has the coolest unique personality.
As you can see, I'm really in the mood to praise everyone.  So I'll continue...Jesse is really cool and I haven't gotten to talk to him in a while, so I miss ya J!!!!  He definitley knows good music from bad...and good hair, most of the time.
Brandon is sooo amazing and I can tell him anything and he's just always there despite everything..heart ya B.
Fleedix was in a bad mood on Tuesday but I love her too...You're truly my sister darling.
Bekah is awesome, as eveyone knows.  We have had so many good times and I just love her for always backing me up and being such a positive influence all the tiem and sticking with me through evvvverything.
Scott is a cool Houghton guy and I haven't talked to him in forever...I miss you Scottietoohottie!  You're soo rad. ;)
MIKE AND JESSE are the best guys ever.  They are so nice and Christian and hilarious and nice and just everything with a cherry on top.  I love them and couldn't lie without them, seriously.  Love you guys.

Ok I'm done...I love everyone!  So if I haven't talked to you in a while, it's cuz I'm busy and not ignoring you, since I'vebeen accused of that recently...
Have an awesome day.

Brett's a good driver even though he's only 15 and calls me fat.  Brandon needs to work on his turning skills...but I love them both anyway.  Would you believe that I'm listening to Ashlee Simpson right now?  Probably not, but I am.  I must really deserve to be stabbed because this is crazy.  I don't listen to girl music artists.  I never cease to surprise myself do I?  I'm in the mood for a road trip...Like to some random place in New York.  Anyone wanna take me?  And I also really wanna learn how to surf.  I could so pull off the whole surfer girl look dontcha think?  

Onto a more important matter:  The packet from the school in Georgia came yesterday.  I love that school so much.  It's so amazing and beautiful and big and awesome.  Now after I get accepted (which I hope I will).....I'll have to decide which school to go to next year.  Here or down in the South.  And I have no idea which one to pick.  So help me out and tell me where I should go.  Lydia already thereatened to kill me if I don't go to Coudersport...And Kelly threatened to kill me if I do.  So AAAAAAAH....

Aaaah many good times.  I'm jamming out to John Mayer and he's so amazing.  I need tosee him in concert again.  I wish I could play guitar.  I can't wait til my lessons start!  Whoo...Then me and John Mayer can play together.  I have to work tomorrow, aaah I don't want to.  I need a new job like sitting in a nice, clean room doing absolutley nothing.  

I'm contemplating on whether or not I wanna go to Olean tonight.  Yep.

I realllly like Dashboard right now...And Tbs, and everyone that I've ever really liked in my life.  And I have Love Song stuck in my head severely.  It's so good...I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU...then the guitar solo...man o man.  

I wish I was going to camp right now.  *sigh*  The most I can do is go to see everyone at the concert!  Like Colleen and Nick and Jaret!  Yeeeah baby.  I might go to Ashley's tonight, and then the fireworks are tomorrow!  Awesome, cuz they're like the best thing about the fourth of July.

Annnnd, it's really close to Myrtle Beach- aaah I love that place, tans come every 2 seconds in N.C.  anyways- I'm in love with TBS...And SoCo...And Thursday...Yes I am.  My new boyfriend is named Andrew McMahon, he's the lead singer of Something Corporate- have you heard of them?  He's really hot, and he sends me presents.  He's buying me a house in California where we can get married on the beach and I can play Konstantine while he sings it.  He dedicated that song to me actually...Umm I just told him to name it Konstantine.  Ok I'm gonna stop, I'm not in the mood to be this depressed, lol- but it's true-all of it!

I think a shower sounds fun!  So I'll get right on that, have a lovely day.  I changed my default picture!...It's Andrew, yes it is.  OMG, I went to this website that said that McMahon was a Cuomo wannabe.  I was so mad.  That makes no sense because Weezer and SoCo are nothing alike, they're from totally different genres.  I was furious...but then I went to the guestbook and read all these entries that people put yelling at them and saying Andy was better.  Ok that had absolutley no point.  I'm still kinda dreaming.  I woke up in my sister's room behind her bookshelf with a pillow I had never seen.  I NEVER sleepwalk...so I'm kinda creeped out.  Maybe it was my stalker...who knows.  Gonna go bye cya later.

I couldn't even finish the cds.   I wanted to break them really bad.  God, that freaking place even affected my interpretation fo 3 perfectly good cds.  And to think that I wanted to go BACK there.  Wow, I'm never setting foot there as long as I live.  Too many bad things happened to me there.   I like Coudersport somewhat.  But I'll leave it at that.  Anyways, yeah...I love Kelly.

I'm not your average girl, so this is why I'm not talking to you-

AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER WHILE KNOWING THAT I HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU, A MEDIOCRE FRIENDSHIP WILL NEVER BE SINCERE.  HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE IT NORMAL AGAIN SOMETIME later.

"event","Well today and yesterday have been insane.  Yesterday I went to work and then have youth convention from like 5 until 11.  Then this morning I had youth convention again at 10 and i just got back at 3.  I have to sing tonight in front of everyone.  Ack.  I'm sincerely worried because I can't find my other DC shoe- wrath upon it all!  I shall be studious and search for it in vain tonight.  AFFFFter youth convention- the last service! :(  I'm sad, cause it's been fun!  It really has, *sigh.*  I must be starting a trend because now everyone has a livejournal and a picture page!  It's ok though, cuz everything in life is peachy keen?  F-in right...  I love my sister.  I am going to say that every day.  Because she's awesome in every way!  JUUUST so everyone knows!  woot.  woot.  WOOT.  woot. woot.  Aaah I'm going crazy.  I'm sooo tired- I just wanna sleep!  Which is rare because lately I haven't slept at all.  Last night I stayed up just laying there until 3:45.  I really hate that feeling, a freaking lot.  Awww Bekah and my little sister both have their dance recital tonight!  Good luck girls!  Bekah sang this morning and tore it UP!  That's my Rebekah Leigh for ya.  Well I'm gonna go down to work really quick and do something to put on my time card!  -Later

"event","Well today actually has something going on!  I'm pissed off cuz I ouldn't go to Olean with Brandon yesterday. :(  But anyways, I have to work at 1, and then the youth convention tonight at 5.  Yippee.  I seriously still don't know where I'm going to school next year.  Because I really don't like my parents sometimes, but strongly dislike 80% of the Houghton population.  Aaah well, I'll just be home-schooled and eat granola bars, mmmk?  Sounds good.  And I'm sick of being stalked by a certain someone- LEAVE ME ALONE, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!...Stalkers are sick I say.  Don't you agree?  Mollusk, Annelid, Hi Ben, ARE YOU SAYING I'M SOME KIND OF MENTAL PERSON!?, So Perfectly PINK, GIVE ME THAT SOCK!, etc, etc, see those are the reasons that Houghton is awesome.  Other than that, Hilary Duff is fat and ugly.   And what is it with her sister singing now?  God I wish I could punch her.  I would enjoy that very much.  Yayyy...*  I love my sister, she's so perfect that it makes me jealous.  Grrr!  But I'm gonna go, cuz I could vent/ramble for years!  Bye cya.

"event","Wow, last night was wacked.  First of all, I baby-sat until around 11:30...then I came home and everyone was sleeping...weird.  So then I tried to go to sleep and I absolutley couldn't.  So I came out around 1:30 and made tea (yum).  Then Val woke up and we made macaroni and cheese and watched Court T.V. until 4:30.  Then I went back to bed only to have Carolyn annoyingly wake me up at 9:00 just to talk about nothing.  Sometimes her constant good mood can get on  the shady side, lol.  So now it's 11:55 and I just woke up.  *sigh*...I have nothing to do today.  I wanna go see Harry Potter- fuahahaha.  I might go in to work tonight because money is good.  That it is.  Amazing I say.  Loriann came up from Virginia yesterday!  Woot.  Youth convention is all this weekend.  Meaning our church is having services tomorrow night, Saturday morning, and Saturday night.  Wow, it's gonna be a ball of stress on a stick! *makes a sour little kid face and sticks out tounge*  Yeah, before this entry gets a little too weird, I'm gonna gooo.  Bye cya.

Well today was the usual.  I woke up at approximatley 1:30 PM.  Very nice if I do say so myself.  I have my pilates time finished and I'm baby-sitting tonight (uggggh).  But hey, atleast it's money right?  Money money money, gotta love it.  At this current point in time, I would like to point out that I have NO IDEA where I'm going to school next year.  Seriously, it's a complete toss-up between quaint Houghton and bumpin' Coudersport.  Message me and let me know what I want to do, because I need all the help that I can get, seriously!  And time is running out because I have to make plans for next year and blah blah blah-DO I WANT TO LIVE HERE OR NOT!?  Aaaah...just stab me with a herring already.  By the way, go to my picture page so you can be insanely jealous of my sister who met Everclear, thanks bye.

Today was good.  I had a violin lesson and the song that I have to play for districts is suicide on a stick.  I have to go into work around 5 and then choir at 7 until 9.  Wow I've got a full plate.  Well not really...but full for the Summer.  Pilates is awesome, everyone should do it.  Abs of steel baby.  There's really not a lot to say, like usual.  But I thought that if I have any prolific stalkers, this would be the place to learn about my life, so yeah, hope you enjoyed the show.

But yeah, that's about all there is today, because it's summer, and my days are nice and long, with not too much going on other than work.  So yeahhh, I'm in the mood for a road trip...Anyone that drives wanna take me somewhere!? =)

"event","i just c so many people who say, "" i love the emo song! but i don't know how it goes.""
well i do, so i'm bored out of my mind and i just thought i'd ******* post it damnit
i'm sorry if anyone is offended by the certain words in the song, so i bleeped them out

dear diary,
mood: apathetic
my life is spiraling downward. i couldn't get enough money to go to the Blood Red Romance and Suffocate Me Dry Concert. It sucks cause they play some of my favorite songs like 'Stab My Heart Because I Love You,' and 'Rip Apart My Soul,' and of course, 'Stabby Rip Stab Stab."" and it doesn't help that i couldn't get my hair to do that flippy thing either, like that guy from that band could do, some days you know. . . 

i'm an emo kid, non-conforming as can be
you'd be non-conforming to if u look just like me
i have paint on my nails and make-up on my face
i'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs
'cause i feel real deep when i'm dressing in drag
i call it freedom of expression most just call me a f*g
'cause their dudes look like chicks, their chicks look like d*kes
'cause emo is one step below transvestite

stop my breathing and slit my throat
i must be emo
i don't jump around when i go to shows
i must be emo

i'm dark and sensitive with low self-esteem
the way i dress makes everyday feel like Hallowe'en
i have no real problems but i like to make believe
i stole my sister's mascara now i'm grounded for a week
sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies
i can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing
girls keep breaking up with me, it' never any fun
they say they already have a p*ssy, they don't need another one

stop my breathing and slit my throat
i must be emo
i don't jump around when i go to shows
i must be emo
dye in my hair and polish on my toes
i must be emo
i play guitar and write suicide notes
i must be emo

my life is just a black abyss, you know, it's so dark. and it's suffocating me. grabbing ahold of me and tightening it's grip, tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans . . . which look great on my by the way

when i get depressed i cut my wrists in every direction 
hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection
i write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses
i told my friends i bleed black and cry during classes
i'm just a bad, cheap imitation of goth
you can read me ""Catcher in the Rye,"" and watch me jack off
i wear skin tight clothes while hating my life
if i said i like girls i'd only be half right

i look like i'm dead and dress like a homo
i must be emo
screw XBOX i play old school Nintendo
i must be emo
i like to whine and hate my parentals
i must be emo
me and my friends all look like clones
i must be emo

my parents just don't get me you know. they think i'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy. well, a couple of guys. but i mean, it's the 2000s. can't 2, or 4 dudes make-out with each other without being gay. i mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways. i don't know diary, sometimes i think you're the only one that gets me, you're my best friend. . . . i feel like tacos"

You've found hope
You've found faith,
Found how fast she could take it away.
Found true love,
Lost your heart.
Now you don't know who you are.

She made it easy,
Made it free,
Made you hurt til you couldn't see.
Sometimes it stops,
Sometimes it flows,
But baby that is how love goes.

You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.

It's a secret no one tells;
One day it's heaven, one day it's hell.
It's no fairy tale;
Take it from me,
That's the way it's supposed to be.

You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.

You laugh, you cry, no one knows why
Behold the thrill of it all...
You're on the ride
You might as well
Open your eyes

You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.
Even angels fall
Even angels fall"

"event","Have you had someone that you loved so much and thought they would always be by your side?  Then one day you wake up and their gone knowing that you will never get to have them anymore?  Never even get to hear their voice again.  And won't even get to expeirence their touch.  You told this person everything because they were the one you felt comfortable telling, but then their gone and you feel so alone and so scared that you will always feel like this. Afraid you will never find someone that you can tell your most deepest thoughts to anymore.  And the longer you feel this way the sorrow and depression turns into anger and it builds up so much that you just start to cry.  You feel better for a while then you start to think about it and it just builds to anger from sorrow again.  After this happens you are never your self again.  You try to make things look like they are ok and you're over it because no one understands but deep down you really arent over it.   You have friends that you can talk to but they never seem to understand and the ones that do just isnt the same as telling your boyfriend or girlfriend.  And even if you only knew the person a few days or weeks or months, they had such a big impact on your life that it will change you forever and you dont know how to deal with the change after they are gone.  You would have a bad day but you could always look forward to their call.  Then one day when you need that person to talk to, they wont be there........

"event","1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at her house...she runs around in her underwear just like we do.
2. DON'T CHEAT ON HER. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, she WILL find out and you will be mud.
(whether you did or not, every girl in the universe will find out, dont give them reason to doubt)
3. Beware of every single male relative and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your ass at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the damn hat.
4. Never miss an opportunity to tell her she's beautiful.
(make sure she knows you think so, and when she disagrees tell her again)
5. Don't refuse to kiss her in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's just because they're jealous.
6. If she slaps you hard, you deserved it.
(dont give her a reason to get that mad at you)
7. Don't be afraid to touch her if you want to. If she's going out with you in the first place, it's because she likes being in your arms.
(hold her close, make her feel secure, dont do it because she asks you to, but because you want to)
8. If you don't sleep with her, DON'T tell your friends that you did.
8.5 If you DO sleep with her, DON'T tell your friends that you did.
9. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it...
10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales.
(bring extra cash, and dont make a big deal out of it, or even mention it, it hurts their feelings, and never mention their weight, ever. Even if they are skinny, never tell them they are too skinny, its the same as telling them they are fat, they want to know you love them for who they are, not what you want them to be)
11. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a pussy.
11.5 Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time!...
(men are supposed to pay all the time, but if you're in a serious relationship its good for her to know that youre alright with her paying, she wont think you want to dominate everything in the realtionship, and what she brings to the table is important to you)
12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship.
13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely.
14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to beat the shit out of him.
15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer. 
(and make sure you always introduce them as ""your girlfriend"")
16. Never, EVER slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, ""Oh, you're so dumb"" or something, never make any gestures back.
(never hit, or hurt a girl physically, if you do, expect rule ..3 to come into effect, and me to personally beat the shit out of you, or shoot you, whether you know me or not)
17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went.
( dont make a big deal out of it either, let her know if a chick flick is what makes her happy, you're willing to do it, no matter what the event may be, this also applies to her family, she loves her family, and if you love her, you have to learn to love them too)
18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents, and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.
19. Don't flirt with their moms...that's just freaky.
( and never comment about their mom being good looking what so ever, if she asks, a good response is, ""Yeah she is pretty, but what do you expect of someone who had someone as beautiful as you.""
Always defer any talk of beauty to her, her being more beautiful)
20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like shit, so be understanding.
(dont ever ask them if its their time because they are being bitchy, ask them if they need you to do anything for them, again, always give comfort)
21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it.
( but dont make a big deal out of it, tell them that you prefer to drive and leave it at that)
22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend.
23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you.
24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them without being asked.
25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle.
26. Memorize their damn birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life.
( girls think if you really care about them, you shouldn't have a problem remebering things that are important to them, if you dont have a planner, get one even if its for this purpose only, you'll spend less time in the dog house, and more importantly they will know you care)
27. Don't marinade the cologne, but smell good.
(if their ex wore the same cologne, change to something else, girls relate a mans smell to whom it belonged to, always and forever, and you really dont want that complex)
28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice.
(give her something that lets her know you care, car parts, whether needed or not, dont constitute a good gift)
29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out.
30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibilities, privileges and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond.
(you dont get a second chance with girls, dont break their trust, and dont put yourself in a position that would allow you to)
If you have read this, and you are a girl, then some of these things are actually really true...am I right?! And if you read this and you are a guy, then these are like the mother fuckin best tips you could ever get!"

And no other, could give me more love
Theres nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way

You cant tell me its not worth trying for
Just cant help it, theres nothing in the world i want more
I would fight for you, yeah I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah I'd die for you

You know its true
Everything I do, I do it for you"

"event","OMFG!!! let me tell you a ""little"" bit about my trip. San Francisco sucks!  they have some of the rudest impolite people i know.  We first went to McDonalds when we got there and the people were fuckin pushin and shit and i got really pissed.  Then when i sat down to eat this jamacian dude with a skate board comes out of the bathroom and yells really loud ""Million dollar turd dropped in the toilet and exploded.  Mission accomplished!"" really loud so the whole mc donalds could hear and i started laughing so hard.  Then the next morning we went to breakfast and we had the same damn thing 3 mornings in a row.  it got old fast.  We seen a homeless dude sittin on the sidewalk holding a sign that said "" Sick from Aids.  Need money for food""  or some bullshit like that.  In my opinion he should have kept his dick in his pants and he wouldnt have aids and sittin on the sidewalk beggin for money but its just a theory.  The streets there could not be any freakin steeper.  Thats y u dont see fat people there cause of the hills they have to walk everyday.  Then we had a bus driver that was driving ""so fast"" or so the people said that it gave them motion sickness or some bullshit like that.  HELLO HAVENT U HEARD OF DRAMIMINE!  Then we went to have chinese.  god was that an experience.  They brought out muscles.  I bit one but i couldnt swallow it.  Then jon sprung dared me to bite into a pepper.  i didnt think they would be that hot but it took me like 30 mins to get my mouth to where i could stand it.  I almosted cried.  yeah yeah stupid me.  Then like the first night we had this lady cut in front of us that looked like a fuckin fly.  her arms stuck out like the wings, she was about as tall as one and walked as fast as they fly.  Then we went to an aquarium and i got pictures of nemo and dori.    Then i found a fish and named it thurman cause it looked just like ms. thurman.  eyes and all.  Then we took a trolli ride to china town today and we fuckin couldnt get on a trolli back to where we were supposed to because they were filled.  I was so pissed.  We had to cram on one and the dude driving it was like "" A word of advice.  Get a station wagon!""  i was about to say ""HEY FUCKER!  WE CANT GET A STATION WAGON WHEN WE ARE OUT OF TOWN AND CAME BY PLANE!""  stupid asses.  Then when i got on the plane to come home me and kaitlyn were laughin and this stupid fuckin hoe was like ""I 'D LIKE TO HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENTS!"" Then when the plane landed she was like ""WHATS TAKING SO LONG?!?""  dumb bitch.  god...... well thats about it for the trip.  If i think of something else ill let yall know.  im out

If i was him i would leave me like that too.  I mean even the most loser people of the school have a boyfriend or girlfriend and i dont.  But right now, i really dont want one.  actually its more i dont deserve one.  fuck it i dont care anymore.  Good luck to all that have someone that cares about you.  im happy for you all."

My weakness is that I care too much 
And my scars remind me that the past is real 
I tear my heart open just to feel 

I'm Drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
I'm pissed 'cause you came around 
Why don't you just go home? 
'Cause I channeled all your pain 
And I can't help you fix yourself 
You're making me insane 
All I can say is...

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut 
And my weakness is that I care too much 
And our scars remind us that the past is real 
I tear my heart open just to feel 

I tried to help you once 
Against my own advice 
I saw you going down 
But you never realized 
That you're drowning in the water 
So I offered you my hand 
Compassion's in my nature 
Tonight is our last stand 

[Chorus]

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down 
And I just wanna be alone 
You shoulda' never come around 
Why don't you just go home? 
'Cause you're drowning in the water 
And I tried to grab your hand 
I left my heart open 
But you didn't understand 
But you didn't understand

Go fix yourself 

I can't help you fix yourself 
But at least I can say I tried 
I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life 
I can't help you fix yourself

The air was nice and cool and barely blowing.  My Aunt has 2 wiener dogs.  Rosco and Oscar.  I call them Rosco Costco and Oscar Meyer Wiener. LOL   On the dirt road my aunt lives on is like a big horse shoe street and practically everyone that lives on it is related to  me some how and they are always riding their 4 wheelers on the road and stuff.  It's awsome, i wanted one too.  I hope I can go down there during the summer for like a week cause my aunt and uncle and my other aunt said they would take me fishing on their boat and my aunt would take me hunting.  hehehehe.  Well while i was down there, here are a few words i caught myself saying:
Flair = Flower
Sodi= Soda
Winder= Window
thats all i can think of at the moment.  but if you thought it was bad before, gees.... lol
I drove down there most the way and i got behind this old fart and i almost rearended him because he was going hella slow.  god, old people.....   well i guess thats all

I remember when we were little,
I always looked up to you,
You were always my role model,
And i loved you very much.

We always played together.
You wer just like a best friend,
I can talk to you about anything
No matter what it is.

At your Graduation,
I seen you receive your diploma,
I knew you had made it,
And I was so proud of you.

I'll always have your back,
I'll always be by your side,
I'll be right there next to you,
When you're walking down the isle.

No one will ever understand,
what kind of bond we have.
It's one I hold in my heart,
And is very special to me.

No one can break us apart,
Nor do they dare try,
I just want you to know,
I'm always by your side.

To my sister who I Love very much."

Now I'm feeling lost and alone.
Always wondering where you're at,
I feel like I'm caught in a trap.

Do I wait for your call hopefully tomorrow,
Or do I move on and live with this sorrow.
It makes me cry and sometimes mad,
To wonder if you are what I have or had.

I want to hear you just once more,
If not my heart is completely tore.
I never got to say goodbye,
But even if I did, I would hope it's a lie.

I often sit and think about you,
wondering if you still love me too.
All I want is you to see,
That this is not over for me."

And I slowly go insane 
I hear your voice on the line 
But it doesn't stop the pain 

If I see you next to never 
How can we say forever 

Wherever you go 
Whatever you do 
I will be right here waiting for you 
Whatever it takes 
Or how my heart breaks 
I will be right here waiting for you 

I took for granted, all the times 
That I though would last somehow 
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears 
But I can't get near you now 

Oh, can't you see it baby 
You've got me goin' CrAzY 

Wherever you go 
Whatever you do 
I will be right here waiting for you 
Whatever it takes 
Or how my heart breaks 
I will be right here waiting for you 

I wonder how we can survive 
This romance 
But in the end if I'm with you 
I'll take the chance 

Oh, can't you see it baby 
You've got me goin' cRaZy 

Wherever you go 
Whatever you do 
I will be right here waiting for you 
Whatever it takes 
Or how my heart breaks 
I will be right here waiting for you

Your eyes burn through me,
Oh, like a raging fire.
I fall blissfully,
Every time you say just one little word.
You know it makes me crazy.
You ask way too much,
Oh, when you say that I can look but do not touch.
I have never wanted any other girl,
The way I want you, baby.
I surrender to what I can't control.
Drunk with desire, I've opened up my soul 

You know I would go around the world,
I'd take you anywhere,
Oh, baby anywhere,
For a touch of heaven.
Tell me what you want, I'll give you anything,
Oh, baby everything,
For a touch of heaven

I have dreamed of this,
Your body next to mine.
Drowning in every kiss.
How I've longed to find my one and only girl.
And I found her in you, baby.
All I ever wanted is everything that you are.
Don't leave me longing,
Be tender with my heart.


[Chorus]

Everyone says you've been leading me on.
Too late for warnings, I 'm already gone.
Ooh, I surrender to what I can't control.
Drunk with desire,
I'm giving you my soul."

"event","I hate it when someone in ur house is sick then u get sick.  My throat hurts, my head hurts, and my back hurts for some weird reason.  Im supposed to be spending the night at rebecca's house then going to this carnival tomorrow and help her run conssession stands too.  Hopefully ill feel better.  I havent ate in 2 days cause everytime i look at food, it makes me wanna throw up.  On the good side of that though is ive lost 11 pounds.  But on the bad side is i lost it the wrong way.  But if i were to eat id just throw it back up anyways so whats the point of eating right?  It's supposed to be like 80 degrees here Monday and Tuesday.  HELL YEAH!!!!  Worlds of fun and oceans of fun will be opening soon too.  The question is....should i ride the rip cord?  For those who dont know what that is, its the sky coaster where ur on a cord and it drops u 200 ft.  think i should do it?  Id be screaming SHHHHIIIITTTTTTT!! all the way down.  lol well thats about it.  A bien tot!"

"event","You know, I was sitting here thinking.  Im almost a sophemore.  It's great to grow up but honestly, i wish it could be like it used to.  When i was about 4, 5, or 6.  My sister and i had so much fun.  We used to go outside and build club houses and everything.  We had an old metal shed that we would make as our club house.  We'd get cheap little hot wheels and build like humps and play with them in the dirt.  We put some things into an egg and buried it up against the side of the house.  She'd used to take me into the play room and play school with me.  She'd teach me times tables when i was in kindergarden just learning how to write my name. lol  We were good friends with our neighbors and we'd go over and swim with them alot over the summer.  We would go up to my grandma's and play in buckets of water with all of our toys.  In the fall we would rake up a bunch of leaves and play in them.  We loved to go to wyandotte county lake and play in their big play area.  I remember i was afraid to go down the slides. lol  We'd watch Doug, legends of the hidden temple, Wild and crazy kids, and all the other awsome shows that used to be on nickelodeon. One winter we go snowboards from my uncle and we went outside in the winter and would snowboard. I'd always want to do everything my sister did.  I looked up to her alot.  When she got into about 8th grade, she didn't want to do anything with me or hang out with me.  I got really sad cause i wanted it to be like it used to.  I remember we got into a big fight so i made her chocolate milk and took it to her.  I look back at those times that were fun and then i realize they arent coming back.  It just seems like yesterday i was in kindergarden and my sister and i were outside trying to find something to do in the yard. I'm going to be a sophemore soon.  I'm the youngest and in about 3 years it will be my graduation.  It's crazy, its just crazy.  I miss the old days......"

I feel bad sometimes cause i cant relate to people like that.  I guess ive always had what they call a ""tradional"" family that cares about me and is involved with school and stuff.  i dont know how divorce or death or step parents are.  this is the first time i post a poem but it kinda fits my mood right now:

No one would understand,
what kind of fate is left in my hand.
Maybe I can figure it out tomorrow,
Maybe I can get rid of this sorrow.
I guess I will never find the answer.
I'm tired of waiting for the reply,
I'm ready to leave this earth and fly.
I've been locked away for way to long,
What i'm about to do is selfish and wrong.
But I'm sorry mom and dad,
This was my only option that I had.

My loving friend Emily Christine Pierson  Good luck with your twins!"

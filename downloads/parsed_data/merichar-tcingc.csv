"event","We left for the airport at 9:15pm on the 5th by taxi. Our stuff was xrayed and then we made it to check-in. Hallie's flight was at midnight and her gate was open by the time we got to that section of the airport so she left and I was waiting until my flight at 3am. I was reading the Sinhala-English dictionary and a book in Sinhala when a girl looked over my shoulder and asked ""Can you really read that?"" and I told her that I could prounounce the words for the most part, but I didn't really know what it was I was reading. She looked really amazed and then asked how many years I had been in Sri Lanka... Then I got to tell her, ""uh, ten weeks."" We got to talking and she's eighteen and going to Singapore to study there on scholarship. She asked about what Hallie and I had been doing at the CRC and I showed her a brochure and she asked to keep it :). Her plane boarded pretty soon after.
My gate opened up about an hour later but the plane was running a little late and I was almost the last to board because I fell asleep and someone poked me and said it was time to go around 4am. It was Sri Lankan airlines and I noticed that they wanted it to look like the stewardesses were wearing saris but the're not really practical so it's a bit like a cloth flap that goes over their shoulder.
We landed in France and I got off the plane to find my connection to Amsterdam, and when I went through the customs guy he noticed how odd it was to take a 45 minute plane ride to go to Amsterdam and then go to JFK. He was like, ""Well, it was probably cheaper. Hopefully you're not going there to smoke."" And so I told him that my school booked the flights so I don't think they would have sent me there to smoke.
I made it to Amsterdam and was waiting for my flight to JFK. While we were sitting and waiting for the gate to open the group near me hears someone yelling, ""Is this how you deal with customers? You stick your fingers in their face like you're from Brooklyn or something? Look lady, *I'm* from Brooklyn."" At which point you could tell every American in the room because they were all laughing. There was a group of Long Island women and their husbands that quickly became the communication hub for what was going on because nobody could see him but they kept getting new and exciting information.
On the plane before we took off one of the stewardesses announced that the aggressive passenger would not be flying with us today.
When I got into JFK it looks like my bag got lost somewhere, and it took an hour and ten minutes to get through the line of 15 people at the lost baggage counter. My parents started to get worried that I hadn't been on the flight so they managed to call the lost baggage area and find me. 
I got through customs without too much hassle, I just have no clothing. Ok, going to sleep now."

"event","I woke up next to Gawry at 5:30am and did some of the final website stuff. She woke up a half an hour later and started tea. We said goodbye to her parents around 8am and walked to the CRC. 
Dimutu had to go to town to pick up bananas for the after lunch snack for the children, so I went with her. 
After we got back Gawry grabbed all her financial files off my laptop and then I packed up the last of the stuff. We had a last cup of tea and were going to hop in the van but we had to wait for Pushpa to get back so we could say goodbye to everyone. Pushpa came back and he had gotten two plaster welcome signs for Hallie and me from the whole staff. We said goodbye to everyone and ""Mage petiya!"" to Madhu and then Nandana came out with the camera and took pictures and then we said goodbye again. 
We left the CRC in a van around 10:30am and came to Swasha's house at 7:30pm. We were busy repacking and they ordered Domino's Pizza for dinner which was really nice and the Dias's came over to say goodbye and gave us a hat and Y's Men T-Shirt that was really nifty.
Then Swasha and Ashan came in to say goodbye and that was swell. After that we finished packing."

"event","Today was our last day off in Hambantota, and we got up early this morning and went to Kataragama with Dimutu and her son. We took the bus to Kataragama and a three-wheeler to the temple. Outside there was a fruitstand and you bought a bowl of fruit and brought it in with you. The whole place is like this giant garden with a bunch of different buildings and the first one you got to by crossing a bridge over a pond with a bunch of fish in it. We waited just over the bridge with her son and when Dimutu came back some of the fruit was gone.
The next building had a giant statue of Buddha in it and I think I came halfway up to his kneecap. We stayed and talked to the priest when Dimutu and her son went farther down the hall for something and then came back and we left. There was some fruit left in the bowl so we got to have that and then we left and gave the bowl back to the fruitstand guy.
We stopped at a small place and got Coke and lemon cookies and ate there. Then we walked around the town for a bit and there's this fountain in the middle of three hands holding up a sphere.
We waited a little while for the bus and took it back to Hambantota and from Hambantota we got a three-wheeler which dropped us off at Thushari's house. Dimutu had made us lunch packets because she wasn't sure how the food was in Kataragama, but we hadn't gotten a chance to eat them so she handed them to us as we were heading to the gate and we ate them at Thushari's house. It was rice and curry in plastic wrap covered with newspaper for protection.
A bit after lunch I headed into the CRC to help Ari fix his computer which had gotten a virus. After that was done I headed out and Ari and Wanni headed into the kitchen to try and make tea. I don't want to see Dimutu's face when she sees the kitchen after that :)."

"event","Dimutu had to pick up groceries for today's lunch and I went with her. While we were in town we stopped by the doctor's office, which was an adjancent office to his house.  He sent Dimutu to sharpen the backs of the earings and while she was gone he pulled out a photo album of all his kids and his older son is in the UK with his children. Dimutu came back and he had her draw dots on the ear where it was even and then he put the earings in. He wanted us to stay for a cup of tea but we had to get back because the kids were coming soon so he told us to come again sometime and we left.
We called the CRC and I got a Sinhala newspaper and we took the general transport back and then her, Hallie, Pushpa, and I got into the CRC bus and went to pick up the kids. We also stopped on the way and picked up pineapple as the snack for after lunch. 
I got to help serve lunch. Doing the rice is really easy because you just pile it on until the kid says ""eti"" (""enough""). Nandana had something come up so Hallie got to help teach his class, which was turning on and shutting down the computer for the younger kids but after the first time Gawry just did it because she knows the Sinhala for it.
After work we went to the e-Center. It looks like Hallie lost her flash drive. When we were wrapping up Thushari and Harith came in and she said she was arranging computer lessons for the whole family so that's really nifty."

"event","So today just after lunch I was playing with Gawry's watch in the psycho-social room and then I ended up with Dimutu's necklace but then when Tall Madhu came in there wasn't anything I could do with her earings because my ears aren't pierced. By the time girls hit preschool they're taken to the doctor and their ears are pierced. 
We had a field trip after the kids were dropped off and got earings and then stopped at a doctor's office, but he was busy, so we'd have to go back the next day.
We stopped by Dimutu's house on the way back and she got cream soda from her dad's shop in front of her house and we all had some and then we went next door because her sister had a baby two days ago and we got to see it. 
When we were walking back a bat flew in front of us so I said, ""oh, hey, a bat"" but I didn't know Sinhala for bat so I flapped my arms up and down and said ""bat"" but the glass was still in my hand and it dropped out of my hand as I did it, so that was pretty bad.
I got dropped home and Gawry and Hallie were on the porch talking and after I got there we got up and went to Gawry's house. She had a bike with her and we walked it back too. She lives down the same dirt road that David and Trisch had been living on, too. When we got to her house we met her parents and her dog is named Nicky, too. Her older sister had a baby and she's really cute, too. 
We sat down and she showed us the photo album of her sister's wedding and her dad watched the Sri Lankan equivalent of CNN.
Then we moved to the front porch and her dad cut open a coconut and we got to drink it and Gawry brought out an extra chair which was her kindergarten chair because at the time each child had to supply their own desk and chair but not anymore. Later on her and her dad walked us home."

"event","You know it's a bad 4th of July when you wake up with food poisoning. Hallie had been up since 3am puking but it didn't hit me full force (read: puking) until 10:30. We decided to take the first half of the day off. Hallie made it into work after 2pm, but that wasn't happening for me. Not a whole lot was happening for me. 
Nandana walked Hallie home after 6pm and checked in on me... There was what Hallie likes to call a ""flurry of Sinhala"" over the phone and suddenly there was an Executive Director. And another flurry. And then a Gowry. This was the biggest surprise because she was staying home instead of going back to school in Ratnapura to be with her sister and her sister's new baby when her mother left to take care of her grandmother.
Then we had an educational trip to the hospital with transport on a three-wheeler (Did they put *more* ruts in the road since yesterday?!?) and it's a bit like a grocery line. I was number 44 and Hallie was 45. The three-wheeler drivers are really helpful. Arosh had been the one to come get us and picked up the tickets and kept an eye on where the line was while we had a conversation on reincarnation in the alley by the car. I'm pretty sure we decided to come back as birds so it would be easier to meet up. Hallie likes owls, I like robins, and Gowry's a flamingo. I don't know what's wrong with her :). I think we've got to schlep over to where she is, though, because she's a bit more climate bound than we will be. 
The hospital is pretty neat. A bit more is outdoors than what I'm used to, but it's still pretty neat. There was a curtain with a small flock of Sri Lankans outside and just inside an examination room. The doctor was fluent in English and it was nice to be yelled at in a language I understand. He was a cool guy. We were charged with bringing peace before we left. Sounds like a neat task.
Gowry filled the prescription outside the waiting area at the pharmacy and on the way home we stopped at one of the roadside shops and she picked up 1.5 litres of Coke (I get it when I don't feel good, too!) and biscuits (probably won't be trying those for a little while). We got home and she translated the Sinhala directions to English and headed home. It's comforting to know that poor doctor handwriting is a global phenomenon.

Trip to a Sri Lankan hospital: $3.00
Tablets to settle your stomach: $0.50
My co-pay would be higher than the actual cost of the whole thing (-Hallie): Priceless"

"event","Today was fantastic! Gowry stayed in Hambantota to take care of an Audit on the CRC but she was done by 2:30 so she met us for lunch at the Double N next to Thushari's house. Hallie ordered chicken and Gowry and I got fried rice. I tried some of Hallie's chicken but Gowry didn't because she's a vegetarian. 
We had wanted to go see the hot springs so Gowry called up her younger brother Gayan and he picked her up to go round up his friends and she changed into not audit clothing. She walked back and her brother came back with the van and a couple friends and we went to the hot springs. There were a couple wrong turns, but really it was more like miniature adventures. We got to see treehouses that farmers slept in to keep an eye on their banana crop because Elephants really like bananas and there were a ton of peacocks.
When we got there the hot springs were nifty, too. You don't go in them, but you get buckets and you can pour the hot water over you. I won a splash war that Hallie was an innocent bystander to my victory for, so now I've got threats of Chili-water happening.
After the hot springs we went to go see the elephants at the same place that we went a few weeks earlier with Joe. There were six and we got to get closer because there were folks dumping the trash there that the elephants were eating. Neat stuff. Hitching a ride is a little more common because it's a small town and the busses don't run after 7pm, and we gave a lift to someone who needed to get into town.
On the way back we got to stop at Gowry's uncle's house and have a Coke and lemon crackers and stuff, and we dropped off one of Gayan's friends at his house and got to try a Buddha Apple while we were there. They're really really sour. One of his other friends went in and started playing the drums. Then Hallie and I found out that the four of them are in a band together and play at weddings. 
The second to last stop for us was a roadside shop and they picked up these really weird snacks that are from a tree and look like sticks but tasted pretty good and sort of tree-like. Then we got dropped off at Thushari's house and Gowry came in with us to do html stuff and she got to eat dinner which was cool triangular bread with stuff inside. Her dad came to pick her up on a motorcycle after. How cool is that?"

Sinhala words of the day: Ahka ""ah-cha/kah"" Older sister and Nahngee ""nah-ngee"" Younger sister

Comment on SWotD: It is way more common to call someone by their relationship to you than anything else, so Malmi screams ""MAHLEE!"" when she's calling Harith and he screams for ""AHKA!"" when he's looking for her. It also extends beyond the direct meaning of the word and Nhangee can be used in place of a name for any girl younger than you are and Ahka for any girl older than you are. The same for Mahlee (younger) and Ayah (older) with boys. It works out really well because you don't have to know any of the kids names at the CRC (but I've picked up as many as I can), everyone is just Mahlee or Nahngee."

We brought in the spagetti and tomato sauce and apple crisp. I don't think it was an instant hit, but I liked it. Maaike gave Hallie and me each a card with a picture of the staff and a note in it and we said goodbye to her.
In other news, of all the foreign viruses I could have gotten [pause for collective intake of breath by my parents], it had to be one that affected my Windows partition. Argh. It looks like it's from the original Windows install disk for the entire lab. Hallie's got it from when she set up her dual-boot, and I got it from transferring some photos from one of the lab computers.

I got to cut apples and Thushari helped and brought out all the big knives and pots and help core the apples. Then we roasted peppers and that was pretty neat because you just throw them on the burner until they turn black. Hallie said that even Spud could do it.
All the cooking got done and we put the stuff in the refridgerator so it would keep until tomorrow and we'd bring it into work with us."

Originally we were just going to bring Malmi because Harith is a little too young, but he threw a fit when he found out he wasn't going. They didn't go to any of the classes, but we stayed in the psycho-social room and they played games. New student registration was today, too. All the new students went into the pyscho-social room while their parents filled out paperwork. Harith and Malmi took on the job of welcoming committee and pulled them over to where they were playing. Malmi was showing a few of the older kids games on the laptop and Harith got all the younger ones to play with him and some plastic animals. 
Somewhere in the middle of that I got in a good game of Mancala with Dimutu. The rules are really different here. There's seven stones in each of the small bins and the turn doesn't stop until the last stone drops into an empty bin or your mancala; gameplay is also clockwise instead of counter-clockwise.
Classes ended and since it's beach week, instead of going to the front lawn and playing games we walked behind the CRC to the beach and played train and Red Rover and that stuff. Malmi was called during Red Rover and broke through the line. She was so excited that when we got home a little while later she ran to the backyard where Thushari was, and in a flurry of Sinhala including demonstrations she explained the rules and what had happened."

Hallie and Trish did all the cooking. I carried stuff and washed dishes. It was great fun and the food turned out really good.

They had heard about the CRC and brought some medical supplies and were looking to maybe teach some classes in health and first aid.
Anyhow, this was also supposed to be the day of the teleconference with kids in Kandy, so at 3:00 I walk down to make sure the e-Learning Center was ready for us and Hallie would wrangle all the kids into the bus at 3:15 and drive down.

One louse later we realize we've got no good way to hold the critter so naturally Hallie pulls out a maxi pad and it sticks on. Fortunately it looks like there was only one and two nits on her and even more miraculously I got off completely. We brought it out to show Thushari and she goes in and grabs Licene which is supposed to kill them.
We called in sick from work, and since they were seconds from calling a doctor for us Hallie ended up telling them the deal. Then we both do the Licene thing and wait the two hours for it to dry and wash it off. One more lice check and we walk over to the CRC for a half day.
Gowry thought we were dead or injured from the arm wrestling yesterday :). Nandana had gone to the hardware store in the morning and replaced all of the taped network cable with real cable tacks. It looked awesome.
After the kids were gone the last project was to set a custom environment and login for each age group and the staff and little things like not letting the kids have administrator access rights to the teachers's files.

Gowry is huna, ""hoo-nah"", which means lizard; Nandana is meharakee, ""me-ha-ra-key"", which is she-cow (as opposed to meharaka which is he-cow); Hallie is best of all because her name means big in Sinhala, so she's hali gimba, ""Ha-lee gim-bah"", which means big frog; and I'm aleeya, ""ah-lee-yah"" which is elephant. More staff have joined the menagerie, so we've also got a rabbit, two deers, and a giraffe.
The network is finished, too. Nandana pulled out the box of cat5 and a screwgun to put a hole through the doorway. There isn't excactly a ladder, so it was really fun running cable from the office down the hall to the computer lab along the ceiling. I wasn't alone, though, there was a really big frog hanging out perched on the doorbell speaker enjoying the festivities. Unfortunately PC House didn't have cable tacks so we needed to go to a hardware store and hadn't made it there yet. Right now it's being held up temporarily with masking tape.
At the end of the day Hallie arm-wrestled (and beat or at least tied) most of the staff. I could beat all the girls but got taken down after a long gruelling match by Nandana."

"event","We waited until our day off to take care of picking up stuff from town and decided to have our first bus adventure to Ambalantota. Good thing Hallie was there... I managed to start towards busses going in the wrong direction twice. Town is too far to walk and three-wheelers are 100 rupees but the bus is only 15. The trip there it was pretty crowded and we were standing. First stop after the bus dropped us off was Food City and we got water for the day, then walked up the main road to PC House. Hallie got herself a USB key and we also picked up a power strip, which is awesome because for two and a half weeks now we've been charging laptops in turn with the one plug adapter and to use my external drive I had to have enough battery power to last whatever I would be doing with it because it needed constant power. So yeah, power strips are awesome.
Second stop was because Hallie missed jeans and was tired dressing European but they didn't have girl jeans at the place. Then we went to a fabric place and picked up nifty patterned fabric for Thushari's birthday, on account of her liking to sew.
Final stop was to a stationary store and I got two notebooks for 90 rupees and we got a card.
The bus home was a little more interesting to orchastrate because every bus will stop at Ambalantota because it's a big town and all, but we had to make sure the one getting home would stop near Thushari's house. Looks like we got on the right one, though, and it was pretty empty on the way home so we even got seats.
There's a conductor guy on each bus that takes the money after you're on and finds out where you're going so it's pretty neat. The roads aren't great, though, so you tend to step out of the bus assuming your liver and kidneys are all mixed up and you need to give your stomach time to sort everyone out again.
On the way home Hallie came with me and we both got Cokes from next door and went across the street to the e-Learning Center. We checked email for a couple minutes and then the director walked in and beckoned everyone into one of the other rooms in the building and had them sit down. And then there was a teleconference with kids from another technology center in Kandy. They sang and danced and did a short skit and Hallie exhausted most of their English vocabulary.
I talked to the director about bringing over the kids from the CRC and getting them to perform for the kids in Kandy and in two minutes he handed me a cellphone and I was talking to the director at Kandy talking about the work we were doing with the CRC and possibly partnering with the e-Learning Center. Neat stuff."

"event","Hallie talked to Ashan in the late morning and it looks like he likes the new format and he wanted us to introduce it as soon as possible. We're going to try and get them to use the new forms for this months report, but fill it out by hand and with us there helping and stuff. A lot of the information is what there used to keeping track of already so hopefully it won't be that bad of a transition and then next month maybe they can use the computer lab and we can have each teacher fill in their reports electronically instead of Kumari having to type in each teachers report. Anyhow, we introduced the forms at a staff meeting today at 3pm. The visiting councellors were doing a special program so we could grab the staff for a little while. My laptop had a large group of kids attracted to it when I showed one of them Windows's pre-installed Pinball game. There's been a lot of rebooting in the last couple weeks because Malmi's favorite game is in Debian and Harith's is on Windows.
At the end of the day after the kids were gone Hallie completely decimated any networking productivity we had going by breaking out her Street Fighter ROM and USB controller. It took an hour to build the only cat5 cable that was keeping us from going home. *sigh*."

I spent another chunk of the afternoon creating a halfway decent CSS example for working with Nandana later, which showed a really simple html page and then when you uncommented the stylesheet link it made it something way more professional looking."

There's a monthly report that the CRC generates but its format lacked a strong structure and there weren't any reliable metrics for tracking student progress so Maaike, Hallie, and I grabbed a bunch of previous reports and barricaded ourselves in the psycho-social room and came out with a new report format to type up in word and show Ashan."

He did seminary in the States and has been to NYC and California. He's got a wife and three children, two boys, two and five years old, and a girl of two. His church is right down the street around Hambantota hospital. He invited us to come down to lunch one day.
We went to explore the e-Learning Center which is across the street from Thushari's house to see how it's net connectivity was. It's 35 rupees an hour to use their machines, and the place is air-conditioned. Whee! The satellite server was down, so we didn't get to do anything we had really wanted to, but they said that it would be right tomorrow and they'd let us use it free because of today's inconvenience. Ashan said he was willing to cover the cost of a broadband connection to the CRC, so hopefully we'll be able to form a partnership with these guys.

"event","We came into the office at 9am today because Nandana was going to the singing competition in Gall with the kids. Everyone was dressed up and the women instructors were in saris and the kids were getting ready to leave at noon. Nandana got his first break at 10am and that's when we went to work on the network. Getting power to everything was really sketchy involving a few plug adapters coupled together... We should probably pick up a real power strip for the computer lab next time we're passing by PC House. Anyhow, except for two computers we had the whole thing up including filesharing and all sorts of good stuff in less than two hours. We told Ari about our plans to visit the perahera in Tissa that started at night and went to lunch. When we stepped back into the office he had an envelope for us. He had a contact that would get us three nice seats for the parade and we should ask any official there for the high priest's secretary and they would get us there. Mr. Ari is like a red-tape chainsaw with influence like the Sri Lankan Godfather.
Maaike picked us up at 3pm because even though it's a late night parade, the roads close really early in Tissa. Hallie, Maaike, Mark (Maaike's husband), and Stephie sat in the back of the van and I got shotgun with Coralee driving. Coralee is from France, Mark is from Holland like Maaike and works for the Chamber of Commerce, and Stephie is from Germany working at ASB, an NGO. Lots of folks were on the road and at one point a bunch of wild cows were clustered together hanging out on one complete side of the road. We drove to a guest house in Tissa and met Neal and Una, both from England. Neal was reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and is from just outside Manchester. Una was raised in London but lives on the south side of Brighton now. There was an outdoor pool with a nice view of the lake so a bunch of folks went swimming. Everyone else had spent a lot of time in Sri Lanka already and everyone but Hallie and I were in their late twenties or maybe early thirties. Coralee has been here for a year, but I think it would take longer than that for me to work up the nerve to drive. Maaike and Mark are down to their last couple weeks from ten months and will leave Hambantota for Holland around the same time we will leave for Weligama.
At 5pm a guy in a boat came up from the lake and offered to take us on a boat ride. All eight of us piled in and we saw water buffalo, pelicans, and some great trees. I got lots of pictures. After the boat ride Una and Neal went to change and would meet us later. The rest of us went to a restaurant for dinner. I got noodles and chicken and brown onion soup. Mark tried to find out how his soccer team was doing but the game wasn't on and satellite tv had been stopped. From what I could gather it's either because the government isn't happy with the BBC or they didn't pay the right taxes. Also, it looks like there's a government run paper called the Daily News which was explained to be a little bit more worse than Fox News at home. Hallie was amused that Fox's notoriety was so well known.
We left for the perahera and got to go pretty close with the car because they had gotten a car pass. When we were about to park two boys came up to the car and asked for school pens. No one had any but I had a two pennies in my pocket and I always like foreign coins and they seemed pretty pleased with them, too. The rest we did on foot but it wasn't too far and we were walking through a huge crowd of people and there were tons of lights and people selling stuff. It was really neat. We got into the gate which was the nice section with good seats without any issues and met Una and Neal up the street a bit. Maaike had been holding on to their tickets but they had gotten in with no problem from the guard which folks figure is because they were white. The parade started at 10:30pm and it was incredible. It started off with guys dancing with whips and flag bearers holding their flags palms out which looked pretty uncomfortable. There were at least a dozen elephants throughout and dancers and drummers and everyone had brilliant costumes. I got a ton of pictures and a couple short movies of the elephants. When the last dancers had passed, around 12:30am, the crowd followed them down the main street. It was moving very slowly and there wasn't anywhere to turn off and walk to the car because the road was flanked by shops and then rice paddys. We decided to wait and went into an alcove of fruit stands and shops and ordered tea. There was a cute wild puppy that kept hanging around us. About 40 minutes later we decided to try and get back to the car. The perahera was just returning but we got a lot of the way through and then turned onto another street that was busy but didn't have the parade going down it. We got back to the car and Coralee drove everyone home. Hallie and I got in around 2:45am, Thushari and her mom were waiting for us and had watched it on tv.

"event","Ashan came to the CRC today. Hallie, Maaike, and I presented what we'd been doing, which was creating a structured daily schedule of lessons and playtime.
Maicha noticed that without a real schedule the older kids would just run up to the instructor and say they'd like to do this first and would get it. 
So now, it's really explicit. It's also going to help with the technology curriculum, because we know what time constraints we're working with for each class. Also he's really thrilled about the student database. The trick's going to be getting it accessible online.
The kids were there practising for the competition tomorrow. Swasha met with Wanni and also talked to Nadisha (one of the kids (who is adorable (I really like nested parenthesis))). 
We sent Swasha the brochure we finished a couple days ago and she is going to get them printed. When we got to talk to her today she said she switched the ""Our Mission"" and ""Our Services"" sections, which sounds like a really good idea. I can't wait to see them printed and everything. Ashan must have been really happy with them, too, he wants us to do another when we get to Weligama for the Youth Progressive Foundation.
In other news, the networking gear showed up. Whee! Got to spend a bunch of time making cables and tomorrow Nandana, Hallie, and I are going to install and configure the router so we can get a LAN up and running once and for all. 
Walking home I got a Coke from the place next door to Tushari's house. It's the little things.
We made ""pizza"" for dinner. Hallie wrote down all the stuff we'd need and Tushari got it when she went grocery shopping at Food City. I really like the Sri Lankan derivatives of American food. All the *components* of pizza were there, but somehow it turned into something approaching salad with Mozzarella cheese on top. And it was spicy. I don't know how given the ingredients, but it totally was.
After dinner Tushari put up with me stumbling through two short stories written in Sinhala. One was about a lizard that kept running up an elephants trunk and the other was about a lion and a donkey that were friends hanging out in the forest. 
When the munchkins were asleep Hallie and I watched Interstate 60 on her Macbook. That is a nifty movie. It messes with your head, but it's really nice about it.

Turns out there was less swimming and more wading with occasionally getting knocked over by an ocean wave. I didn't bring a bathing suit, so I wore a t-shirt and my shorts. They've got a lot of pockets, though, and in retrospect that was a bad idea. When we got home I had pockets and pockets of sand. It took forever to get them clean.
Afterwards I went to the convenience store next door to get a Coke, but they were out of the 500mL in plastic bottles and only had the glass 175mL. So I grabbed a glass
one, paid, and started to walk out when I hear, ""Miss, where are you going?"" It turns out that the store owns the glass bottles and you can't leave the store with it. So I got to drink it there and have an interesting conversation with the shopkeeper who was completely sympathetic to the fact that when you buy a soda at home, you implicitly own the bottle."

Either he grew a lot or my sense of tall is now skewed. On the other hand, I've spent two weeks feeling really tall, so that's kinda cool. 
We showed him around the Center, and he met the staff and Maaike and we showed him the brochure, and then there was lunch. On the itinerary Ari typed up it had what lunch was going to be, including ""curries with less spice."" I'm kinda worried what regular curry is going to be like if that was not really spicy...
After lunch we discussed the scope of work for the project and Wanni and Joe think it's full of good stuff.
Originally we were going to go to one of the national parks but that was changed because another park had been a target so we went to see elephants instead. I got to see elephants! Five were hanging out by the side of the road and stuff. Got lots of pictures. On the way there and back we also passed Hungama, the Hungarian Friendship Village which is a bunch of houses built for displaced tsunami victims.
We went back to the Center to walk over to the beach. At one point I was standing on a dune when it collapsed and I slid down to the bottom. A big wave decided that it was just the right time and washed over me so I was soaked. I walked back along the beach to Tushari's house to change but she had gone out and the doors were locked. So I walked back to the Center and we left for dinner at The Oasis and I tried to think dry thoughts. Dinner was good. It was Hallie, Joe, Ari, Wanni, Nandana, and me. Lots of courses, too: Bread, salad, soup, fish, chicken, fruit, pie, tea. Joe was staying there for the night and heading to Weligama tomorrow, so we said goodnight and goodbye and the van dropped us off at Tushari's house."

Nandana, the driver, Hallie, and I went to PC House in Ambalantota to order all the networking stuff. Before we left Wanni disconnected and handed to Nandana the office Belltel phone to take in the car. After a few minutes of driving it started ringing. Turns out it's wireless and can run on battery power. I'm definitely trading in my cell.
Computer stores in Sri Lanka are pretty nifty. They are more like warehouses because they just display everything they have on shelves and if it's there, they have it in stock. Also, the customer service is way better. We got quotes for all the networking components: 16 port switch, cable, connetors, crimp tool. They have to order it because it's not in stock. While we were waiting I also got to pull out and see my first Sinhala/English keyboard. That was cool.
Unfortunately, I think the cheap prices for software are made up for by the high cost of hardware. 
On the way home we stopped at the Belltel office with the phone. Hallie and I were waiting on the couches when Ashan called. Hallie grabbed it and was talking for a while and then she handed the phone to me.
""Hi Meg, I usually touch base with Hallie, but I wanted to check on how you were doing... I hear you have an affinity for wild animals.""
He must have gotten that from Hallie's blog. She didn't let me live it down for the rest of the day :).
There's a convenience store next door to Tushari's house. I worked up the nerve, walked over, and bought a Coke. A real live Coca Cola. It was wonderful.
Before dinner Hallie wanted to walk on the beach for a little while, so I did that and got some more shells.

Madu was trying to use the Center's laptop (with all the Center's financial files on it) for ""painting to music"" with a few children, because they didn't have a CD player. Windows was complaining about a corrupted or missing configuration file and the laptop wouldn't finish booting. It wasn't a quick problem to fix and Meshka doesn't have an CD drive, so I ran home and grabbed Hallie's Macbook and set that up. Nandana and I messed around with it for a bit, and I recovered the critical files off the laptop with a copy of Knoppix. Then the hard drive completely crapped out. A sustainable system for backing up the CRC staff files jumped a couple projects ahead in the scope of work real fast.
For lunch was pumpkin curry and before the day was over Hallie and I got a nice staff photo for the brochure. Hallie got bit by something and her foot started to swell a little bit. Most of the staff pulled it around to get a better look and did a complete diagnosis in Sinhala and then Dimutu disappeared and came back with stuff to put on it. It was hilarious to watch and Hallie kept giving me evil glares when I burst out laughing. I told her I'd be happy to amputate it if it came to that."

I showed her a spot I was trying to find a picture for because it was really short and wide and asked if she could think of one that would work and she was like, ""well, the kindergarteners made kites yesterday, that might be able to fill it right."" I asked her how high the kites actually flew and she was like, ""nonono, they stay up because they run with it and it stays right behind them"" :). So when the kids had some free time we went out to the frontyard with Maaike and Kaushlia, the kindergarten teacher. They were going to run in circles between Kaushlia and Maaike so I could get a good shot, but the first child wound up making a huge circle around the yard and it took him an extra minute to get redirected. It was really cute. I got a bunch of great pictures of them with kites and then a few of the entire class around the swings. Then they all huddled around the camera to see how the pictures turned out. The bigger kids showed up a little later and liked the camera so we did a bunch of group photos of them, too, and after each one they'd rush over to see and it would get passed around and then everyone would run back for another. 
Harith also has mastered the camera and will run around the house taking pictures of everything. He's picked up how to zoom in and out, he can switch into slideview mode to show others his pictures and then go back and take more pictures. He's a pretty impressive five year old. He likes to tinker with the way everything works and Hallie and I joke that he's going to become an engineer and are trying to figure out how soon it would be possible to get him an application to CMU. Malmi has mastered almost all of the games on my laptop, uses KoulourPaint to draw pictures with her brother, and types up rhymes from her book in OpenOffice.
Friends of Thushari's came into town tonight after the kids were asleep and are staying in the upstairs apartment of the house for a few days. Hallie got home from Columbo after I was already asleep."

At the end of the day Maaike was organizing a game of Cat and Mouse. You chose two cats and everyone else tucks a ribbon into the back of their pants or skirt as the tail of the mouse and the cats try to catch the mice by grabbing the tail. Hallie and I got dragged into the game and it was really fun. Afterward Maaike came up to us and said they had been really excited and kept coming up and telling her ""They're running with us, the auntie's are playing with us."" Auntie (sp?) is apparently the word for a generic white person. I'm kinda curious what its orgins are.
After we got home we went on our third three-wheeler ride with Thushari to Food City and picked up Citronella oil. You smell like a candle, but it helps with the bites and keeps other mosquitos away. We also got Ice Cream :).

They generally hang out in the corners of the ceiling. It's a nifty design, too. The shower is not really separated by a tub from the rest of the bathroom, there's just a two inch recess in the floor where most of the shower water ends up. It's kind of a neat design. The thing that takes some more getting used to is the cold showers. There isn't a hot water heater, you just get whatever the temperature of the water happens to be that day.
There's also a bunch of lizards that hang out around the house and eat the flies. They're pretty cute, too.
I woke up with a ton of mosquito bites. Dimutu, the CRC housekeeper, thinks I must have fallen asleep with my arm against the mosquito netting. Everyone kept looking at my right arm to see the row of bites. Malmi was practising her English by counting them. She got up to 67.
I pulled out the poster paper and spent a good bit of the evening playing tic-tac-toe with Malmi. She had never played before, so it was hard to teach her because I didn't know the Sinhala words for ""three in a row."" We worked it out, though, mostly through trial and error. It was pretty cool.

For breakfast we had something called milk rice that was really good. As our first task, Ashan asked us to help create a brochure for the CRC.

"event","Mrs. Dias called this morning while Hallie was out getting more clothing to last an undetermined amount of time since they hadn't found her luggage and said hi and made sure we were ok and everything. Hallie got back and we packed up and checked out and got a sandwich while waiting in the lobby for the driver. He came and we loaded all our stuff in the car and set out for the six hour trip to Hambantota.
We took the coastal road instead of Gall road that goes straight down the middle of the country. The driver was nice and talked about all sorts of things and we pulled over to a Buddhist temple and he put money into one of the roadside coin boxes and he said that it was always good to donate something and receive the blessing before a long trip. He also talked about the ropes tied around the trunks of coconut trees in rings all the way up used as hand-holds and then showed ropes going from one coconut tree to another so that the climber who was collecting Toddy to take it to a distillery and make Arrack wouldn't have to climb down each tree. We also went by a lot of tsunami affected areas full of roadside graves and houses that were completely washed away leaving just the foundation.
We got to the CRC a little late and it was pretty dark. We had dinner that looked like omlettes and rice and some spicy stuff and ate with our hands. All the staff was there for the dinner, they had stayed late to meet us. After dinner took the CRC bus with all the staff in it to go to the house where Hallie and I would be staying. We met Thushari, who owns the house, and Malmi, her 8 year old daughter, and were shown our room which is really nifty with two wardrobes and pink mosquito netting over two beds. Hallie said sleeping under mosquito netting was kind of like playing fort."

"event","I got into the airport at Columbo at 3am local time. Customs went really fast because another station opened up right as I was approaching and so I was third or fourth in line.
After that I grabbed my bags, called my parents to say I was alive, then sat down and got comfortable with the Macromedia Flash 8 Bible. Hallie's plane got in at 6am from Mumbai. After her plane landed I got kinda bored waiting for her to get through customs so I pulled out the roll of poster paper and wrote her name in big letters and when she was finally coming down the escalator held it up. Because hey, we hadn't seen each other in a whole week.
They had lost her luggage by the time she had gotten into Mumbai, so she went to talk to the baggage claim guys and get it sorted out. When they found it she would come back and get it. There was a bunch of money-changing stations with different ones calling out at us when they saw we were figuring out which one to go to.
After that we went outside to see if someone had our name written on a sign or if someone was waiting for us. While waiting we attracted a flock of kids as well as some stares from older folk. Two hours later we were getting kinda nervous so I went in and called my parents who could get us Ashan's cellphone number. It was busy so we called Joe who told us he had called the Diases and they would come get us when we called him back. An hour later I was really thirsty, but neither of us knew if we walked past the fence if we would be allowed back into where we were waiting. I got up the courage and asked the guard that I was pretty sure understood the question and walked through the entrance past the sandbagged military unit and two guards with big guns to a little stand and bought two bottles of water then walked back. Not long after that, a woman wearing a sari came out holding a sign with our names on it. Woohoo! We followed her back into the airport through the hallway that we had come out of that had lots of stands advertising hotels. She brought us to a really fine looking one that had a door and found it was air conditioned when we had gotten inside. Turns out they had been paging us for a good long while but we weren't able to hear it where we were. Hallie talked to Ashan, who was awesome about the whole thing, and then we went out and the lady put us and our stuff in a car to drive to the Cinnamon Hotel.
Driving to the hotel took about an hour, and driving in Sri Lanka is crazy. There's these three-wheelers that steer like a bicycle but have a full seating and are smaller than actual cars, tons of bicycles and motorbikes, and then just regular cars and vans and trucks. The three-wheelers go slower than normal cars, but they also drive on the road's shoulder, which is pretty loosely defined, and are eternally jockeying for a position. Every car is eternally passing another vehicle or being passed, and the horn seems to be used to indicate anything from ""I'm passing you"" to ""hi."" I recorded a movie of about 15 minutes of our trip.
We made it, and the hotel was huge with a fountain inside and out front. The check-in folks took our bags and we got taken to our own rooms and they're really nifty and the rooms are huge and there was complimentary chocolate and fruit and stuff.
We headed down to the lobby to wait for our meeting with Ashan at 2pm and he came with his fiance named Swasha and both were really nice and passionate about the work and awesome. Looks like we're leaving tomorrow for Hambantota in a van with a driver who'll stop when we want so we can take pictures or eat or anything. Also the hotel has a high speed connection which is pretty sweet because I don't know what the net connection is like at the Children's Resource Center. Also, Ashan and Swasha talked about finding our way around Columbo because Hallie needed clothes while they find her luggage and I wanted to see a couple computer stores and the hotel is adjacent to a mall and Unity Plaza has a ton of computer stores and we'd be able to get down there with a three-wheeler which work just like taxis. He also warned us about getting ripped off by folks because we're white and that it shouldn't take more than 200 rupees to get down to Unity Plaza. It also looks like Sri Lanka is the piracy capital of the world. 
They said goodbye and we went to see the mall and Hallie got clothes there and then we got a three-wheeler that offered to take us to Unity Plaza for exactly 200 rupees and we went and they had a ton of stores selling really really cheap software and I got Flash, an Adobe Suite, and Visio. There was also a DVD store and I got E.T. and King Arthur to watch while we were travelling. When we got back we had dinner at the hotel's restaurant and I had Shepard's Pie and Hallie had Maccaroni and Cheese and by the end of the meal we were really tired so we went to bed.

For those playing the home game: 1 rupee ~= 1 penny"

"event","Stu went with me to the Allegheny Health place so I could get vaccinations for the trip. I had to get four shots, Hepatitis A and B, Typhoid, and Polio. Fortunately I had gotten the Tetanus one not too long ago so I didn't need to get it again. Bit of a long wait at the place, though. You call up a couple days or so before you go and say ""Hi, I'm going to *, what shots do I need?"" and they email you a checklist you print out and bring with you."

"event","Pnelson came along with me so I could get my International Student ID Card (ISIC) from STA Travel, which covers repatriation and evacuation in a disaster. The place was just off 5th so not a long trip. It was raining though, and we had to walk over to CVS to get passport photos for the card and for the Sri Lankan visa. Fortunately it didn't take long and we bought a gallon of milk and pop tarts for breakfast while waiting.

Word of the day: Repatriation - Bringing your corpse back if you die outside your country."

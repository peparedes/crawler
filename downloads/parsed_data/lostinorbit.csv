"event","I was afraid of repeating patterns, and so for months I haven't written in here so I wouldn't have to deal if in fact my life was cycling. The story, which I'm sure most people already know, was basically that I liked a girl who identified as straight. And things between us were really hot and cold as we got closer and closer because, I don't know, its scary to cross all those boundaries.  Mainly I didn't feel like writing about how I liked someone who didn't really like me, and all the shit along the way that sent me into emotional drama. 

For maybe a month now, we've been dating, acting like a couple and all that. We haven't really defined it though, or talked about it, and I definitely haven't pushed the subject, since Marina was finally willing after so long. We're taking things slowly, courting, for restaurant week this Friday I took her to this French restaurant by the park, because it's her favorite since she lived in France when she was little. She was really happy, and the food was so delicious, so tender, and our old French waiter told us we were a beautiful couple and we should be together for a really long time (I totes gave him a big tip). I don't know, even if things were hot and cold before we got together, it's been really good for what seems like a while now.

Marina is really close with her family, she told her mom about me when I started being her glass TA in March. She asked me to be her TA during her weekly blowtime after I had helped her a little bit during her beginning class in Jan/Feb. I don't think that her mom understands really, and although she doesn't seem to give Marina shit about it, she's not overly supportive. Marina is also reaaaaaaaly close with her grandma who lives an hour away in Riverside. Like they have matching tattoos of elephants. She visits this grandma pretty much every other Sunday. 

And because I haven't written about it in months, all that was a fucking lauren story setup for what happened today. This weekend Marina's grandparents came to visit SD, and Marina wanted them to meet me, and then at a later time tell them that we're dating or whatever. Unforch, it seems like Marina's mom put pressure on her to tell them beforehand, and so she did last night at dinner. Apparently it sparked a really long conversation because they didn't understand either, they're traditional and to use Marina's words, ""they think people of the same gender shouldn't be together like that."" Even if they didn't get it, her grandparents said they loved and accepted her and all that, and then today I went to walk around the farmer's market in Hillcrest with them. They were really nice to me, her grandma told me this really cute story about why she calls Marina precious, and I'd say the day went well because when we went to leave her grandma invited me to come visit her house in Riverside with Marina. Maybe because I was just nodding, she said it twice, the second time really formally, ""I invite you to my house."" But it was cute and Marina's reaaaaaly conservative and kinda quiet grandpa touched my elbow when we said bye. 

When I was getting ready for Friday Vanessa and I went through my closet, and she saw this yellow shirt which she told me to wear today to meet Marina's grandma. When she was tying the bow on the back for me, I remembered and told her the story of the last time I had worn it, I had visited Berkeley with Claire and Le-Mai, right before I went to Costa Rica. S and I had just broken up because her cousins were staying with her and she wasn't ready to tell them. That was the day I met her cousins and pretended to be her friend who just happened to know the small details like where they kept the emergen-c in the second drawer in the apartment.  And that day just sucked, us standing close together, poking each other, and once she got out of the car I cried pretty much until we got back to San Francisco. And so I finished telling the story to Vanessa, and I was almost crying again just thinking of how emotional that day had been, and I decided that I had to live in the present in that moment. And so I went to the farmer's market and I talked to Marina's grandparents until they liked me enough to invite me over. I don't really know how to qualify my emotions right now, they're somewhere along the lines of happy and grateful that she isn't ashamed or scared for her family to meet me, and that they liked me and I liked them. I was prettttty stressed about meeting them and I'm just glad that it went well, and I'm not repeating too many patterns at least."

"event","clay is the coolest guy ive ever known, hands down. we've been getting gradually closer as friends for the last year or so, additionally awesome since he is the best/ most knowledgeable glassblower in san diego. he's close homies with dante (#2 in the world), and back in the day dante sent clay to lino (#1) to learn how to make cups. on friday i helped clay assemble a cuptop on a stem and foot that he had made in 2001, the year i graduated from middle school. (at disneyland we discovered he graduated high school the year i was born) we laughed about that for awhile, at life, and how i was happy he had waited so long, of course after the completed cup finally got put in the box.

clay loves to doodle (mostly snoopy on a skateboard, or a squid catching some surf), and on friday nights he usually leaves notes for kathleen for when she gets there for our saturday morning class. he had given her the fabulous nickname of kathlino, which i mean, is the highest honor because lino is everybody's hero. (if i had any option on who i could wake up tomorrow and become, it would be lino, because then i could fix anything). and yesterday i came into the shop to find a note written on the board, lots of colors and cloud shapes and things, and it said Lauren, the Magnificent! and out of all the things clay ever could have called me, he found the thing that has made me the happiest."

"event","imagine how much popping a bottle of champagne echoes in a parking structure, but a parking attendant on the road just stood there with her walkie talkie and watched us eat bomb tuna fish sandwiches that one dear, dear patty yockey had prepared for us at 5am. and then when we were leaving malibu logan spotted this woman whose patio faced the ocean. no one was around but us, but this exotic woman was pressing her g-stringed ass up against the glass hard, bc she is bored in her life in la or something. i dunno, it was a sight and moment and thing and a day i shall not be forgetting, ever. 

this quote was on my igoogle today, and it reminds me of going to chautauquas with my aunt in reno when i was 14, and how everybody loved this john adams quote. and more recently,  of my bday in vegas last year with my dad when we all went out to lunch with him, and i was trying to tell him it was just the natural cycle that my sisters and i want to make beautiful things because ""I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain."" I tried to thank him for giving us that liberty, but you know my dad, he can't handle anyone being nice to him. 

i dunno, maybe one day ryan will become a lawyer, and erin may become a concert flautist, child prodigy that she is. maybe if i tell my dad how elite the glass world can be, he'll like it more. i suppose he dislikes that i have no intention of having a profession, but how can you help that when you hear the furnace calling?"

i want to go back to malibu now. it looks like you could lie alone on that beach, something i never anticipated could be found in LA.

freshman year of college i really wanted to battle the ocean i guess, i wanted to swim alone in the waves until i couldn't fight anymore. i imagined laying exhausted on the sand. now i would rather sit alone in front of the ocean until i feel like i might know what the water is, i might know how to be, maybe to see that secret where the water and god and i are one, and then i'll get in and float. 

i meant every word of that literally. i just realized i have been working on this, i don't know, greek oceanic series for almost two years, and i haven't really gotten the color setup or shape to be what i want it to be yet. but i feel like i may be coming close to allowing the glass to capture that wordless, heart-swelling beauty that the water has. its like when you're a little kid, and you're going on a vacation to the ocean, you get more and more excited until that moment when you can first see the water, and when you finally see it your breath sucks in a little bit. Forever after when you know you're close to the ocean, you look for the first patch where the water meets the horizon and you breathe in deeply when you find it, your heart pounds a little harder. That's the moment I want the glass the show, the deep peace, along with the familiarity and awe that everyone feels. The glass is like the water when it's hot- it's alive and it's flowing. My problem comes in with that whole changing to a solid state thing. 

I made the thinnest optic-twisted cup of my life on Monday. I'll weigh it soon, just for kicks. The lip is so thin I oddly feel like I'm going to cup my lip on it or something. But I like the cup because when I look at it, I feel a different way about glass than I have before. It is about the thinnest that our particular brand of batch can handle, and it allows you to look at the glass as a material as opposed to a vessel. It sounds overly simple, but when i look at the cup i think, this is glass. This material is such a beautiful thing, there are hardly words for its transparency."

"event","This morning at 7:30 am I received a useless text message from my mom on Steve's phone, telling me that she had left hers at home. At 9:15 K calls to tell me some not-so-useless information about pupillary distance (we're ordering RX glassblowing glasses), though she thought I sick at first until she realized I was still asleep. I hardly ever take my phone upstairs at night anymore because those two Kathleens get up so early and feel the need to contact me. But you know, I like it when I come downstairs in the morning and find a phone full of messages from my mother and surrogate mother because it means they care about me.

A few years ago, in a dark pub outside a university, I told someone that I wanted the world, I wanted newness and adventure, and the past and family and roots didn't matter so much to me. As usual I spoke too soon and I should have found the balance first, but if there's one thing I was back then, it was a vocal idiot. Now I realize that the truth isn't what I thought it was, it's not two sides at all, it's two parts to the same whole. And, as I learned yesterday from the song Dust in the Wind, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky. So I guess I don't have to worry about those other binary oppositions, space is an unjust illusion baby. 

I used to feel like I didn't have a family, that me and my mom and the cats maybe weren't enough to fit the definition. Now I feel a lot more comfortable about where I came from because, well, thats where I came from and it's too late to change that now. But the family that I thought I didn't have, it exists. In Sacramento over break I practically lived at Steve's house with him and my mom and I watched TV with Hayley (we laughed hysterically at a cat falling six stories from a tree with his front paws wide open and how scary it would be for a human to fall like that) and I played video games with Stef and I walked Cal's dog Lola and I held his cute little baby Ella. All of the kids got me christmas presents, which isn't so much about the gift but that they thought of me. When I wasn't with Steve's family Cal was inviting me to hang out with his friends or there's Paul and his friends, or, of course, you guys. What I mean to say here is totally Vonnegut's idea first, but there's the family we're born into, and then there's the family we have to go out into the world to find for ourselves. And at this point in my life, I'm really happy because I feel like I have that with people from Sac and now I've found my tribe of glass blowers, right here in San Diego.

I mean, we all know how weird I used to come off, but now I'm starting to think that the people who think I'm weird are the weird ones.  I'm not weird for the sake of being strange, I'm just myself and I'm doing my best these days to stay myself all the time, not just around people I feel comfortable with.  I'm just saying, for example of how I used to come off, that freshman year of hs there was a lot of dramz during a class trip when we stopped at a mcdonalds and I was neatly flipping my zippo at my waist but the girl in front of me in line, Jackie Rooney, yelled to everyone that I was trying to set her hair on fire. Some days, I'm just really thankful that the glass exists the way it does because it helped channel my mild pyromania into a creative outlet.  And I love everyone I get to blow glass with, I love helping them and watching them get better, and I just love the way I feel around them, like there's no reason to be false. Last night at happy hour Patty kept telling me how happy she was with our Wednesday night group before class- aka Ron the sixty something director of the crafts center, Marky- his best friend, Patty- beginning glass instructor and TA for my class, Rayna- Patty's TA and neuroscience grad student, and James- just back from Shanghai where he was working for Hewlet-packard for 3 years. I have a lot of fun too, especially when Ron is drunk in a golf cart and chasing down Patty through the eucalyptus forest, or we're doing late-night donuts on a dew-frosted, med-school lawn. 

For the past three weeks I've been working up in Encinitas with Cindy, who has her own hotshop. I bring her color overlays, and when she has enough glass we pull square cane murrini twenty or thirty feet up the driveway. I earn blow time for helping Cindy, and she's leaving to Barcelona for three weeks for her husband's conference. With K's help, I'm going to try to take the red, black, and white stripes from the center of the stewart plaid and make a bowl where I keep all my lines straight and there's the right amount of symmetry and space between the lines. I suck at bowls, they're really hard, but I just got my new pipe and punty, and those are straight, so hopefully luck will be on my side."

"event","i havent felt the need to write in forever because things are good, and i think i tend to write more when reality is at an extreme and lj serves as an emotional outlet. but im good and the glass is gorgeous (its finally starting to share its secrets) and i get paid cash moneys to help people work the glass. i get paid to light up every morning at ucsd, and for someone who used to get up at 10 or 11, im surprised how much i can accomplish by that time when im out the door at 730.

a few weeks ago, the madre moved from 205 #3 selby ranch road to a 1 bd apt somewhere in the back right corner of the ranch. for years ive been pushing her to not pay rent on a 2br apt that isnt used except for furniture storage/cat sleeping space, but she said she's not going to move in w steve at least until hayley  graduates and goes to college. so at the very least, im glad that she's going to be paying less for the 1bd that isnt going to be used. im just saying, if we talk late at night or in the morning, she's at steve's and is sleeping there or just woke up. fact: they live together and poor bandito is stuck w salem.

my mom relocated, let's say, two weeks ago? and three times she has had to drive over to the old place (i think it's four cul-de-sacs down) and pick up bandito and bring him back in the car. he fucking hates the car. my poor cat just wants to hang out by the ducks and the dumpster, and chill in the leaves by the pond, and my mom uproots him for the seventh time of his life. this is just after he stopped licking all the hair off his belly because he was so stressed out when i left for college. i just want to go home and pet him and tell him that everything will be ok."

"event","This past spring, I suffered the misfortune of losing my Ipod on the far side of my bed; the poor thing was wedged between the box spring and the metal frame for close to three months. About a month after I lost my pod, I came home one day from the Playmor pool to discover that my laptop's memory didn't want to live anymore. And so, in a rather small span, I lost two years of writing (everything worth anything), and my 4,500 songs that composed my musical library. Even if I obviously hadn't made the music myself, I had compiled the collection (mostly, I get by with a little help from my friends), and how would I ever replace the St. Francis choir, the spanish guitars, the classical music? I'm lucky that Adam helped, and I'm rather grateful that Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, and M. Ward made it onto my computer/secondary Ipod I stole back from the madre. 

This summer I felt rather lost without my music and my writing- they're evidence of my memories, of my existence, of hours and hours of editing until I can't make it more perfect, of the wild and childish ideas I held in my transition to, well, adulthood. And without these things, I had to find something else. Now, I can see that those things left so I could find something true that I knows belongs to me, it poured out of my hands when I needed it the most and I made myself a goddamn body of work- the thinnest, most delicate, covered in frou frou, frilly, pink- a series of stemware that looks like a bunch of pretty bitches in party dresses. And I just didn't know that this frilliness and intense love of K-2 Gold Ruby (femme pink) existed in my core. I didn't know that I believe that everything should be put in the optic mold so I can twist it and blow the glass even thinner. Who knew that twisting something makes it stronger than when its straight?

I made my first traditional Venetian stems (a loopy thing-16th century and two dragons-14th century ) but then unfortunately, I did not care for my children as I should have by putting them in a safe home and they were broken by my roommates. But there's a million more in the tank I intend on making. The ability to make a dragon stem is apparently the mark of a maestro? And I've got plans for a red-headed dragon....I can't for the next two weeks to be over, when all my free blowtime at the hot shop begins :)"

When we loaded up my box spring during round three, my IPod, missing for five months, fell out of its hiding space between the box spring and frame. About a month after my ipod went missing, my hard drive crashed, leaving me with the empty feeling that I had to begin my life anew without my writing or my music library. I had been hoping that my Ipod was somewhere back there in the cobwebby recesses under my bed, and that I would find it when I moved out. And it was so, thanks be to God.

Near my Ipod was a scrap piece of paper diagramming the grammar of a sentence from a class I had fall quarter. First God gave me back my Ipod, for which I am immensely grateful that my 4,000 some odd songs have been returned to me (especially the Spanish Guitar and Classical sections), then he gave me a sentence which made me laugh out loud, by myself, for close to a minute- ""It is clear the South has become a Republican dominion.""

"event","White Winter Hymnal by Fleet Foxes has taken over my life. At random moments of the day I can hear their five part harmony echoing through the noise of all my other thoughts. The last lyrical image of the song is bittersweet and accompanied by music so beautiful and joyous that I just want to float on my very tiptoes while I dance to ""And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime.""

Last night I was driving Claire and Jessica home from Vanessa's family's beach rental by Wind an Sea and I realized the happiest dance motions I can think of that would perfectly accompany my favorite part of the tune is in Silence of the Lambs when Buffalo Bill is taping himself and he tucks and he swirls around his bathrobe. I don't know what else to say about the dichotomy of images here, except that Claire told me today that my confession in the car of such gave her a nightmare. 

Last night I dreamt of a cabin with a shaggy, wild-flowered field by the edge of a forest. A big-ass black bear came through the field, so I shot it. When it got closer, I saw it had morphed into a badly wounded black horse so I decided to humanely put it down by firing again. I headed toward the woods when the job was done, and I had just reached the tree-line when a pack of white horses caught my attention. I whistled, one came over, the rest stopped and waited. I was a little worried about my balance riding bareback, only holding onto the mane, but I talked myself out of my fear quickly. One white horse had gotten injured somehow, so it shrank and turned into pegasus. I carried the injured horse on my lap as they carried me off into the woods. 

There wasn't any snow in my dream, but the hole in the black horse's chest was fiercely red. As red as the horses that carried me away were white. I was following the pack...."

"event","I think that following your intuition leads to the best kind of spontaneity. I had no plans for this weekend, and it ended up being everything that I needed. On Friday, it was too hot and humid in the hotshop. Just disgusting and sweaty, really, so I had to put on my headband, which Kathleen said made me look like a ninja. Which is just a really nice complement to give someone, me thinks. 

After K and I finished at 5, Reyna (grad student in micro bio) took Adam, Chris (reade) and I to a grad student kegger with her at Pacific Hall. I fucking love Pac hall (probably named bc of it's view/proximity). The beer and chips were on a balcony over looking my favorite part of campus, Muir Field. The grad students and researchers played sloshball while we drank their Mexican beers and ate their chips and salsa. I talked w the boys and Reyna, who I see every day, ab their families/backgrounds, etc. And I feel like talking to them about more personal stuff all went really well. It turns out that Adam and I have a lot in common, as far as family histories go. After Reyna headed off to go out and Chris went to work the desk at CV drunk, Adam and I stole more alcohol and went back to the hotshop, where there was a bigger Friday night party than there has been in weeks. Ron was plastered, but bc Adam and i were talking non-stop, really close, legs touching, Ron didn't get too close to me at all. It doesnt feel weird ab how much Adam and I talked ab our sex lives, bc it was all honest, even though I feel like I know more ab his sex life w his gf now that I do ab any of my other guy friends. 

I had heard a rumor that Clay (one teacher I've been getting really tight w the past 2 quarters) had learned how to make goblets from Lino (best glass blower in the world). When I asked him, he said he had been working for Dante (2nd best, child protege of Lino) and Dante had told him to go learn to make goblets from Lino. Lino and Dante are known for being the best craftsmen with the best technical skills. Clay is the same way, and he's so exacting with the glass. 

I can't believe how fucking lucky I am study under Clay. I didn't know he had worked with Dante and Lino, though I did know he had worked for Chihuly for ten years. I say things every day like, ""It'll be finnnnnnnneeeeeeee,"" when the gaffer I'm TA-ing is stressed out ab something, or on Friday, when I was stressed and I was grumbling at the glass, I all of a sudden decided to start singing to the glass like Clay does. And when I told Clay that I did these things, he said he got them from Dante's team, and Lino was famous for singing. I mean, when I was in new york, after not sleeping for four days, I got up at the ass crack of dawn from where I was sleeping on a futon w Louis, and I headed into the cold subway to midtown, where I met Chris and got on a bus to D.C. where we arrived at 11am and saw the best exhibition of my life at the Renwick. Lino has been the best glass blower since the 1970s, but he tries something new everyday, so to see all the techniques he has invented in the last 40 years was incredible. To him, the glass is such a thing of beauty, and he just loves it, and he loves working with it. I guess I just realized I'm not too old to have a hero.

After Adam told me a sick ass story ab his trip to Alaska over Christmas break, we went back to his house for him to burn me some more cds. They live in this cabin-esque house right off of Farms. When I was trying to walk through the hallway to get to the bathroom, I screamed when Chris Reade's huge shadow was suddenly in front of me. We freaked each other out so much we hugged until we were laughing. I love that kid. He offered to drive me home when I had to head back to campus at 11:30, so I stayed until 1 talking w the boys, mostly ab glass, since they keep their pieces on their huge mantle.

Saturday morning my partner Chris (Chisolm) and I pulled four times, the last one reaching over 50 feet. It was the best cane pull I've seen at UCSD, even better than Buzz's, who two weeks ago set a new personal record. On Saturday helped people make things for 8.5 hours, and then I made my dad a thirty minute cup. At the end of a very long day which I had started hungover, I felt pleased with myself.  I really like Ta-ing."

"event","Ryan Gosling's new band, Dead Man's Bones, is my new, not-so-guilty pleasure. Here's my reasoning: http://vimeo.com/3996103

Last night after dinner at Arrivederci- best Italian food in San Diego, as proclaimed by Elio, the Italian glass maestro- Chris, Lana and I visited my glass teacher Kathleen's house. Pinkberry and chatting before the Gates of Hell, K's latest creation. Lana laughed so hard/was genuinely excited when I welcomed her to the family as we left. K's house is so badass- it's just below the fatty mansions on Banker's Hill, but just before the ghetto, as K puts it. The bathroom is 1950 jade green and salmon-pink applianced. Each room is filled with glass from K, Italian masters, and American up-comers. Her husband Rich does metal work, so the house has a lot of fusion-art. The living room has a postcard-picture view of downtown at night; there's a lampworking studio in the garage, and a fucking foundry in the backyard. I hope to one day have a similar badass bohemian lifestyle with a view. 

I'm lucky in that I have many people who mother me, who are mother-like figures. I like to be nurtured I guess, but I've realized recently that I'm friends with a lot of middle-aged women. I get along with them really well, and with people like Lana- a grandma who wears a lot of cardigans, lace, and is a Hebrew-Sunday-school teacher. I couldn't even begin to list all my father, grandpa, and brother-like figures. I'm not saying I'm this legit by any means, but in my African-American lit class we discussed the large family-like communities that slaves formed since they were often separated from their parents at early age. I've got a huge extended family, and as a free woman with the itch to travel, the next relation is just around the curve in the bend. I want to go north. North and east. I'm done with the west I guess. Last night I dreamt of returning to Spain without baggage. I don't know whether to take it metaphorically or nomadic."

I think the intrinsic joy that comes from creating something by crafting/cooking/building is worth a lot. Besides my parents' economic background, there's the preconception that the time we spent at university makes us ""unfit"" for manual labor. I don't know, I feel like I miss the days of working with your hands to create something, but not in an assembly-line type way. At least as a writing major/writer I create content almost every day. And at the end of the quarter we make chapbooks.  

In continuation with the story of my life, I'm addicted to something that burns me. I spent seven hours at the hot shop today. It felt like one hour. K was generous as hell and shared 5 hours of her blow time w me, and I got three motherfucking goblets in the box. I had made three this whole quarter. And each of the ones I made today are totally different. There was even time for a USC colored cup for Cliff. But now my eyes burn. I'm driving across the desert in the early morning. Such is life. The sand burns and the oceans reflects the sun.

I'm setting an alarm for 630 to crack the glory box. I'm meeting my pop at 2 and I want something to give him.

There's been Little Lauren, Chicken Little, Lars, Vegas, Stew, Lorena, Laurens, Lorenzo, Laurita, Lolita, Laur, and now Lawrence and Lola. Also, sometimes people just get my name wrong and call me Laura. Though Tina assured me that Lawrence was another spelling of Laurens, I think that my current nicknames stretch my name to its sound capabilities.  Lawrence and Lola. Which is what Kathleen calls me these days. It's even more fun if you say Lola really slowly, putting your whole mouth and tongue into it. Shit, seems like if I wrote anymore I'd be copying Nakabov. 

I blow glass like it's my job. I spend more time with glass and at the hot shop than I do with anyone else besides Le-Mai. I've been there six days a week for the last eight weeks. I wish I was that dedicated to school. 

I think Kathleen may illustrate my children's lit story with Venetian mice glassblowers and bakers? I stuck with the story idea because the picture of a miniature goblet made by a mouse seemed sick to me. Fucking mice blowing glass yo. How BA is that."

"event","On Sunday I said that I've been blowing glass for four years and I think I'm finally figuring out how to read the glass. Clay (BA instructor) said that yea, it takes about five years. 

I was reading an article about geniuses, and one guy's theory was that if you do something for 100,000 hours or ten years, you'll have it down hardcore. Honestly, I'll probably be making very similar things for the next six years (as well as hopefully getting into lighting), but it's the experience of making a countless number of cups that makes your last one perfect. 

I like glass blowing because most of the advice you get and what you learn can be applied to the rest of your life. It's not about what you can make, its about what you can save or fix. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you (I wish the bear and I could just be friends). Let it fall on center, find balance and roll easily. No sparks, no smoke, your block will live forever. And of course there's my new favorite: Venetian. It means doing two things at once. 

Glass has taught me to try again, which I guess is determination. You fail a lot, aren't on center, have a lump, an uneven bottom, whatever, but there's a next time, and you'll use what you've learned. In glass, habit and practice become success. Your success is determined by how you handle setbacks. Your patience will achieve more than your force. Patience is the most important virtue, because you'll fuck up a lot. And when you do, it's no one's fault but your own, so take responsibility for it."

On one hand there's sadness/disappointment in not going to SF, and on the other side there's always the heat of the hot shop to cuddle up with. 

Kathleen is also the greatest mentor ever. She's always giving me color, blow time, and she helps me out. I try to ""pay her back"" by assisting her, and I try to pay it forward but I still am left feeling like there's more I could do. Maybe I should marry her son (she's already proposed for him). 

It's raining and the sun is shining. What kind of day is this?

Also, V-Day 2009 was super fun, movie morning with the girls; I blew glass with Russell and danced and sang around the hot shop with him. After dinner I drank from my own goblets but I ended up hurling. Red vom, part deux."

"event","I'm finally figuring out how to read glass. On your final heats, when you're opening up the top, the glass should be screaming hot and threatening to fold up on itself, thin like paper. 

My TA John told me to write like glass. Yesterday I found a website with the most complex description of a Venetian hotshop. There's so much synchronization to it: today Kathleen made a two gather bubble while I gave her air, she took a thrice-colored K49 lime green body rap from Lauge, took a punty from Lauge, took a lip rap from Chris, took 3 leaves from me while Lauge shielded her, then she took grapes from Chris while Lauge torched and I shielded her. After we did three, we did a fourth cup just to time ourselves. 16 minutes isn't bad for Fat Baby Glass Works on a Thursday afternoon. It helped that the glory hole was roaring hotter than hell.

I really just wish I could write like John reads pieces from the New Yorker on sleepy Wednesday mornings. His voice and pacing are so excellent, and he's so cute to stare at and visit in office hours. 

Do you guys remember when we went to NY and the American Girl store on 5th? And there was a doll hospital by the escalator, with a doll w crutches and a wheelchair? Too bad the girls I babysit totally have that, and two casts. We played with their AG dolls tonight and during recess time I totes made Kirsten do a dance with her crutches. Hardcore b-boy styles. The girls loved it and Emily made her doll with the cast in the wheelchair ""rock and roll."" She made up a similar song to go along with it. I was impressed. 

Later when I was talking with their parents, Eliot said he thinks Emily might be the smartest in the family. It could very well be true. But it's weird to think that you can already tell that at 5. Even tonight she admitted to being a chatterbox and told Elizabeth off about it. I guess it's weird that they're little humans with incredibly strong personalities and traits, just few years and no experience."

I had two and a half productive hours today where I made a Stangling glass and two goblet cup tops. It's raining and windy like it's suddenly winter in St. James, so rain was blowing onto my piece and the bench. All the tools were freezing. The bits Jeremy brought were cold in two seconds. But somehow I trimmed three pieces without horribly mangling any of the necks. Its nice to not fuck up every top when I trim, but now that I can successfully pull off a cup top in 15-20 minutes, and I have eight to prove it, I want them to be perfect. And my shoulders are always off center.

Clay (BA teacher) came by today, and after he left Patty said he sure likes me. He wants me to be Julianne's partner on Fridays!!!!! Julianne is my goblet TA, and Friday nights are when all the teachers have blow time to make goblets. I spent last Friday night there and helped Clay and Ron with six goblets, so if I was there on Fridays, they would help me make goblets.... I would probably still bring bits and stuff to them when I'm not otherwise busy, but that means I'm not even going to be trained to be their assistant, I'm going to be blowing on the other bench. And Clay knows more about glass than anyone else in southern California, with his help and on a straight pipe and punty from Ron, I could be making some lovely chalices. Le-Mai and I have been drinking a lot of wine recently, so I've been getting really excited about producing wine glasses that serve to enhance the experience. 

I think Clay especially likes me bc we talked about weed for an hour on Friday night. He's a super successful 40 year old surfer/skateboarder/glass blower/ stoner."

"event","Today is the first, let's hope of many, interviews about my work. In the last few weeks I've discovered that I'm generally not comfortable with attention from others, especially if they're older and of the opposite sex (after what happened with Ron, shudder). I'm also not very good at thinking of questions to ask people, even my closest friends. I just don't like feeling like I'm prying (what if I bring up the wrong thing, there's so much that can be inflected through tone and choice of words), even though I'm interested. I feel like it's also (hopefully) some sort of writer characteristic, that I let them be natural and let their thoughts unfold as they choose, and I can decide what they're revealing as opposed to what they're not. I suppose it's kind of like I treat everyone as a subject, an experiment in personalities and humanity. But I def need to work on my communication skills. 

In the way I don't like to question others, I'd rather they question me than just silently judge. I should practice this in my own life. I even don't like being on facebook chat too long, where people can see my name floating there. I'm a lot more comfortable in social situations since I handled Sarah Bauer that way, which apparently then may have just been a test of strength for my own confidence.

There's also the humility aspect. It's not like I'm lacking self-confidence in my writing, because by the time I submit it, I've rewritten it 1,0001 nights. I know it's the best I can make it, and then I send it out into the world. There's nothing embarrassing about that. But then when people start to comment, ask you for readings, etc, now there's an element of vulnerability. You stand the chance of getting hurt if someone doesn't like it, and says so within your earshot. But if you never push forward, and put yourself our there, then there's no chance for growth. You're just restricting yourself. (Notice the way I switched from I to you. I'm giving myself a pep-talk here, I guess.) When friends tell me they like a piece, or liked my reading, (whathaveyou), I feel embarrassed again, I play it off. Abigail and Jordan said that feeling is humility. I hope I have it forever, it'll keep me straight (Part of this relies on staying close with my roots- if I can call my friends that hahaha). And I think I finally understand those actors that say they never watch their own movies, I haven't gotten past five seconds of my own reading. And in a way, it makes me feel badly that so many people attended the Dime Stories reading- Puckett, Claire, Le-Mai, Vanessa, Chris, Clarissa, Lana, even Phil- because it went so long and I read so damn quickly mine was over in a minute and a half. But still, it obviously makes me a lot more comfortable with my piece/reading when Tipper, Clarissa, Tina, and Bronwyn heard me read it at Taco Bell, and then I have a whole table of my friends sitting where I can see their glow in the darkness of the audience. 

The last step of this process: what happens when I do interact with the ""outside/adult"" world (and by that I mean, people outside of UCSD/College). I want to be low-key, calm, and respectful. I want to come off well. I want to be well-spoken. (I need to slow down when I'm talking). I want to appear responsible, trustworthy and quick-witted. There lies a great strength in the ability to make others laugh, but sometimes when I'm nervous my sense of humor is way off. 

In regard to the practical application- Seth Combs seems like a chill guy who hasn't written any harsh interviews I've been able to uncover online. I don't think the interview is going to be thaaaat long anyway. I will be a bit nasty after glass blowing though, which will be a minor fail. But victory and triumph, will be mine. O yes, they will be mine.

Clay, who was filling in for Kathleen, the normal teacher, kept wandering in and out to watch the metal shop pour, climbed up on the roof (to get the lay of the land, he said) and generally disappeared the other parts. He is an AMAZING GLASS BLOWER, but as a teacher, eeh. When he is attentive and giving advice, it's the most valuable thing and exact thing you're told, and then he tells you why it corresponds to a property of glass. But you rarely get all his attention.

After I TA-ed, Russell, another TA and I, had our blow time from 2-7. Easily one of the best times of the week.

The Ninja Turts ended their hunger strike yesterday! Whilst Mai and I cleaned their enclosure, they finally, after two weeks, ate. They're not very happy though. We think they know of freedom. When placed in any enclosure, and they make for the most vulnerable escape point. Last week, while in the circle of books we made for them to play in, they actually climbed between the Norton Book of War Anthology and TestMaster's workbooks and snuck into and behind the bookshelf, the sneaky devils. Last night Allen was pounding on the wall of the mini-feeding enclosure in his attempt to flee. The turts do not know why the caged bird sings. But they are hungry at last, and have the will to keep on living! (we really thought Allen was dead by the angle of his leg when we went to feed them)."

I'm now an official glassblowing TA & poetic tutor of an excellent group of young & older writers. I'm going to blow glass 5 of the 6 days of the week that the hot shop is lit. Lani's BF Jeremey is my new partner, and they live at the Venetian- a fortunate sign considering it's a venetian goblet class. Then I heard from a reporter from City Beat who wants to interview some of the authors from my reading. These are, God Willing, a sign that I'm moving up in the world. I don't expect miracles, Im just trying to work hard to make them happen. 

Its nice how much my life has been influenced by Tim Gunn's unfailing advice, ""Make it work."" As Issa and i discussed at Wind an Sea this weekend, ""Just do it,"" is so ambiguous, but ""make it work"" implies more power on my part. And, as Issa pointed out, its just so classy? metropolitan? when he says it, its not a shoe commercial. if im planning on quoting someone i should try to get the facts straight first. i learned two new things from two new quotes over christmas break. 1- paper chandelier at the Momes- The truth is found between the lies. 2- gift for the madre, from Water Street- The truth will set you free, but it'll piss you off first."

"event","i was on the phone with my dad, looking up at the shadows of soft, needle-ly evergreens against a deep dark blue sky. there were bubbles of clear water on the tips of some of the branches, so i blew at them. they popped. and the moment they exploded, the droplets of water scattered and spread like the stars a few million miles behind them. the water lit up and intensified the stars, like fireworks. then the droplets of water hit my face. i smiled.

"event","so recently ive been feeling pretty psychic. but that's one of those things that's like- well, it could be a coincidence, or a synchronicity, or i could just be cracked out. if youre one of the huge list of girls or people who have posted recently about reconnecting with each other and hanging out, then you may feel like there is maybe some sort of continuum of emotion.  psychic pricklings have been happening to me with a regular frequency recently, especially around Chris. All i have to do is think of him or mention him, and he shows up or calls. im not going to get into all my other self-fulfilling prophesies, oracle- like ideas, and how much i try to resist fate, but the synchronicities (on every topic) happen so regularly id have to be blind (ooo bad joke) not to notice them. 

so anyway, i was still wondering.....psychic or psycho? i know exactly where the lines of 'reality' are.  i mean, whatever (you) may call me, i am not crazy (i dont repeat the same experiment expecting to get similar results), but i just....live on more than one plane i guess. theres what we see, and then theres everything else. in a weirder way, i think the universe has led me to certain material throughout my life to educate me. everything has fallen into place much better than i could have planned for myself, and i am so grateful. life and luck are such great gifts i have been given. i know that sounds cheesy, but i honestly mean it. its 5:55. i know i have a manifest destiny, i just dont know what it is yet. it may be something very small, and happen at old age. quien sabe? ill have a fun time getting there. 

this morning i was studying for my final, and i got really, heart-pounding-ly stressed out. all of a sudden, and i didnt think for reasons related to the test, i was really agitated. i thought that something bad was going to happen to the townhouse, that maybe i should go study somewhere else. i thought that maybe my angels were telling me that the creepster was outside. i kept hearing a signal of two rapid taps coming from the kitchen (a signal i had asked my angels to give me if there was danger). (but honestly, had never heard before). i checked all the blinds, made sure the doors were locked- safe. i checked the kitchen, to make sure everything was shut tight and normal. it was. i tried to go back to studying. i got upset again, i felt like my chair was shaking, but nothing else in my room was moving, not even my water.  i heard more tapping, and i came into the living room and worried a plane was going to fall on the house. i seriously thought ab studying somewhere else. i told myself that i needed to stop fucking procrastinating and study for my final, my conscience-logic-angels told me i was safe. this was probably between 10:30 and 11am, based on when i think i actually started studying. i finished studying at 12:30. 

Le-Mai came home at 1, when i was starting yoga. in the middle of my stretching,  Mai opened the door. i asked her why the girls were screaming at recess, i had a bad feeling earlier. i also had smelled a weird kind of smoke in my room (not weed, if thats what youre thinking).  Mai said that the girls were just screaming because there were so many helicopters. (I chalked the helicopter noise up to living in San Diego, with the huge number of navy and air force planes that are always zooming overhead).

Two days ago, Vanessa had wanted to watch Donnie Darko, so Chris went over to watch it with her. I went home because i didn't want to start a movie at 11pm when i had to get up early to study the next day. 

When i got home from my final tonight, Chris had sent me a link to a fox news article, http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,463725,00.html . on my wall he wrote ""30 hours after watching Donnie Darko"". 

------the headline reads, Three Dead after F-18 Crashes into San Diego Neighborhood. i cringe at writing that, at knowing that three families have been forever changed. around 12, a plane crashed into the neighborhood across the canyon from where i live. the canyon that abigail hike in. when i called chris, he said that abigail had seen the parachuter from her house. knowing how easily three people's lives were taken away today scares me. in a horribly bittersweet way, it reminds me that life and luck are gifts to be grateful for. ive noticed ...stuff..around earthquakes before, but not plane crashes. its also one thing to dream of something or talk about something small and have it happen, BUT A RANDOM-ASS FREAKOUT THAT A PLANE IS GOING TO FALL ON MY HOUSE, AND THEN ONE FALLS INTO A HOUSE ACROSS THE CANYON FROM WHERE I LIVE AND IT MAKES NATIONAL NEWS-- WTFFFFFFFFFFFFF. GOD ARE YOU HERE?

im not scared ab going to flying new york or vegas, if thats what youre wondering. ive got too much life to be living already to be thinking of that :) 


I wanted to return to the natural rhythm of the earth (Heaven is a place on earth is on shuffle right now). Yesterday Issa and I were not studying for a moment to talk about candles, Christ and religion. We agreed that it was impossible to say one religion is the only way, and I ended a statement with, ""that's why God gave us free will."" Issa countered with, ""so you could pick up his.""

edit: i called abigail, and she said are you psychic? I'm outside of your house."

i totes concur w this article. we're all thinking negatively ab the economy, and we're cycling downward together. I think bc people don't believe we've hit bottom yet, and we're living in fear. So as in 30 minutes it will be the anniversary of pearl harbor, i say we (we as in the world consciousness, obv) need to wisely (the pearl) accept that the worst has already happened, and we can only go forward and up from here, in peace and prosperity. or at least in happiness. 

at the temple they were talking ab this, that to dissolve war we must start by dissolving it within ourselves. when our consciousness changes on the individual level, it beings to ripple in the community.

ps in a totally unrelated story on cnn- i cant believe that dumbeldore is gay. every time i read it i.....shake my head...and...cant connect a to b. theres too many parts missing. its prob just bc it was revealed after he died and the series had ended, but... o nicholas flamel."

"event","I wrote 4 pages about the grammar found in the Preamble to the US constitution, and then remembered that my prof is a canadian. at least we're all studying grammar together on saturday at noon on turquoise street in PB, so i can apologize in person then. 

There is something very odd about my professor. He blazes about the corners of his mind, but doesn't really tell us where he's been, in terms of assignments and other technical things. If you catch him with an example of some random rarely-used grammar, he will get a far off look in his eyes, and go on and on about how amazing it is that X should occur. He means it sincerely. There was one day it happened in class too many times, and this girl behind me who keeps us so entertained started crying, she was laughing so hard. Yesterday she told Granger (our prof) that she can't take him two quarters in a row, he's too earnest. Granger also loves talking shit ab the crazy guy who wrote our grammar book (you should read his sentences, the fool's got issues). 


I feel really lucky, bc I WON A WRITING CONTEST YESTERDAY! im not trying to brag, im only glad that i finally won a small something, bc other students in my writing dept are getting published and have readings and are writing theses. We had to compose the longest, most beautiful sentence ever for my nonfiction class (<90students, also taught by Granger). I turned mine in after class had already started, and i dont think Granger had expected to get anymore bc he said he said he had already picked a winner. I turned mine in, and he looked at it for a sec, and shook his head and said sorry man, and he started going over the class material. i thought he hated my grammar; though i obv had tried to do it correctly. then at the end of class, Granger said i had won, and i guess i gave him a weird look over the top of my glasses bc he said, yes you lauren. i read it to the class, and they applauded, and then Granger gave me an everlasting ruby in the shape of a serpent's head. which was flashing when he gave it to me and i said, o its a bike light, (and i was really just laughing to myself bc i won what issa wanted). he said please dont say that, but then the whole class was applauding me and him too prob, bc it was the last day of the quarter. so i guess we shared it, weird. 

I had imagined winning that contest all quarter, i put on a little makeup before i left for school and my stewart headband on, bc i knew omar would talk to me after class, and he did, and he asked for my last name to look me up on fb, but i told him i had already written it on a copy of his paper we had just peer-edited. he smiled. i gave him the copy of the sentence i had just read. we hugged like 3 times yesterday. on wednesday we hugged after we walked for a while after section, and then he picked me up and held me for a while. sounds weird but wasnt. i almost kissed his neck? i havent been this into a guy since Jace (hella days). Omar is just, like, what i want in a guy. and hes as dark as i am light. hes from pakistan but thinks hes paki/black. hes a gentleman who dresses well, he always shakes hands with our awesome ta john after class, and he would look damn good naked. hes cute and has a goofy personality. and his eyelashes are so pretty!
---but before i got sidetracked ab Omar, i had imagined winning all quarter and then thought i had lost, so i let it go. i wasnt expecting anything. and then i won! what a motherfucking lesson. 

at glassblowing i realized how much more Buzz talks now than he used to, which was never. And you can hear him now! Its amazing! im just like, way proud that my class had managed to bring him out of his shell (at least a little bit out), more than i am ab winning a sentence contest. i have this siiick scrap of glass from one of buzz's pieces, it's like a yellow circle, with a purple fan behind it. its ab the same size as my new everlasting ruby/serpent's head. 

last night at glassblowing I was helping Frank (hes a really good glassblower, prob in his mid 60s, who can get really grouchy but has a wicked sense of humor) and he said, your buddy's probably coming tonight, hes just late. (meaning Matt.) i talk to matt so much during class; im really glad we're friends. we talk ab his three sons a lot, or glass. i showed him and lauge my bike light and sentence. the guys in my class ask me every week ab the uc poetry contest, and if ive heard back yet. haha every time i tell them at least a thousand people submitted poems so i wont win, or ever hear anything, john (a retired firefighter and surfer) will say in his gruff voice, well i liked it and i cant stand reading. and then we'll go back to marveling at buzz, and we'll take a class vote to make him gather again. he laughs and jokes back, and we can hear him.  we shake our heads a lot in that class, like no, how did he do that? Its too big and hot.

I remembered orientation of college, the very first night, and everyone flapping around to that song at the end of the Revelle dance, and at the end of the song they started moving backward, I'm going back to the start. In the car, I remembered why I don't listen to Coldplay anymore, and especially that album. I considered songwriting, but then Id have to live in LA.

event 2: Yesterday morning in Encinitas after I had attended the lecture at the temple, I was walking along the cracked sidewalk next to Yogananda's meditation gardens. I was wearing a white shirt from India. Three women walked toward us and past me. I was alone on the sidewalk A murder of crows started cawing. I looked up and they were all cawing and looking down at me. I didn't stop my stride. They stopped cawing when I was gone, and were silent when my mom and Steve and Hayley passed them. 

event 3: after going in the temple store where they have a larger copy of the same pocket notebook T bought me in BCN, and the black sheep, we went to hansens where i got a longboard. i found one that has a lion w a crown and rasta colors. it sector 9. it had a scratch on it, so i asked the guy for an additional discount on top of the 15% off they were offering for all readymade boards. i got 25% off, so my sector nine board cost me $100. hells yes. i got like $50-60 off w tax. 

event 4: This morning I read a quote that I had cut out from a magazine. I have a large stack of quotes but this is the only one i read today as i was moving the pile around my room- ""WHY NOT? It's the kind of question that inspires us to keep working toward our goal- building future vehicles that fulfill the needs of our drivers while having minimal impact on the environment. Our philosophy is to purse technologies that minimize the negative, maximize the positive and, in the end, humanize mobility. Because we believe that technology is only truly advanced if it advances the lives of the people using it.""

event 5: i looked out my window from my living room this morning and saw a crow on the awning across from me, pulling at something long and brown. i glanced down for half a second and he was gone. i got cold and put on my black sweatshirt that was next to me. i went outside and there were two more in the tree. i shut the door. i went into my room. i wanted to write ab some other stuff, but lost the energy and inclination. i saw my skateboard on the floor and wanted to try it some more. 

event 6: i go outside to my cul-de-sac, Via Tranquilo, The Way of the Tranquil. I skate down it, trying to get used to turning on this board. I stop for a second to readjust my footing. I hear a board coming from by where the crazy old lady lives. And Doug pops out, tearing out on his longboard, and zagging down the rest of my little street. 
-----the backstory to Doug- One day on the shutts, I'm trying to study for a quiz. And this guy with blond hair and dreds next to me is trying to talk to me ab what I'm reading. And he's reading ab the greeks for one of his history classes, bc hes a history major. I think that this guy is cute and nice, but what will everyone think when i bring home a guy with dreds? so stereotypical of me, im attracted to guys that look like theyre homeless. then, two weeks later, the only available seat on the shutts is next to him, so i start talking to him. Only his hair has been cut, just the day before!!!! I tell him it looks good, its incredibly fine adn bleach blond. We talk ab classical music for hella days bc he's on the way to that class. He says he plays the guitar. I tell him i really want to learn, and i think it'll help out my left hand when I'm blowing glass. He says, wow, that really cool, its like an apprenticeship. I tell him im writing a story ab glass and i talk ab apprentices too. we leave to walk in opposite directions to class, but he shakes my hand and introduces himself as doug, and we're both like, i guess ill see you on the shuttle then. except i havent seen like in like a month and then this morning when i randomly decide to try skateboarding for a bit he skates by. I also cannot see where he was from my apartment. 

event 7: I looked up crows online. Black is a charged color for psychic energy, as it absorbs all colors and reflects none. I knew this from a story my TA John told me to read to help w my project. He told me to write like glass like Theroux writes ab black. A crow is also the signal for the god of dharma. crows can mean spiritual death. I remembered talking ab cuervos for a presentation in costa rica, where i told my spanish teacher, the only cuervo i know is jose. The story i had to present was ab the black crow stealing colorful feathers, but eventually he just had to learn to be himself. I look at my face in the mirror, right at my third eye, and i watch the blood pool there, under the skin. This is not imagined, there was a large red splotch between my eyes and on my forehead. 

event 8: chris and i are texting each other, and we're joking in a british manner. i easily picture chris as a brit in a high collar, coattails, and a top hat. He's BA on a horse, and he's ultra-confident to the point of being snobby. He duels. he texts back that he could have been that, but he thinks he would have been a scientist. i didnt have room for it in my first text, but i also saw chris with little round glasses on, and his nose and cheeks are red from some kind of heat. I wonder how i see this, If I'm making it up. I think I'm 98% sure on what I said. I ask for a sign if it's right. Chris texts me back, just then, to say hes def dreamt ab being a scientist w red cheeks from drinking to keep the creativity flowing. I think Chris was a gentleman whose passion was science, and he was blessed with creativity. But he was so sure of himself, and partly bc of his aristocratic nature, that he got into confrontations w other people. 

event 9: i put on the song the scientist while im writing. i have two copies, the album version, and a live version from KCRW. what, sacramento?

event 10: i leave you with the lyrics of the scientist. from the album A Rush of Blood to the Head. 
Come up to meet you, Tell you I'm sorry, You don't know how lovely you are. I had to find you, Tell you I need you, Tell you I set you apart. Tell me your secrets, And ask me your questions, Oh let's go back to the start.
Runnin' in circles, Comin' up tails, Heads on the science apart. Nobody said it was easy, It's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be this hard. Oh take me back to the start.
I was just guessin', At numbers and figures, Pullin' the puzzles apart. Questions of science, Science and progress, Do not speak as loud as my heart. Tell me you love me, Come back and haunt me, Oh on I rush to the start. Runnin' in circles, Chasin' our tails, Comin' back as we are. Nobody said it was easy, Oh it's such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be so hard.
I'm goin' back to the start.

Ahhooooooooooooooooo
Ahhooooooooooooooooo
Ahhooooooooooooooooo
Ahhooooooooooooooooo


to synchronize in time...
Om. Peace. Amen."

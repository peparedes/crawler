kyle actually called me and invited me over.
by the time i got there though brittany was over.
it was alright.

i sat in the kitchen for the first hour( as usual) 

and then watched news with karla and dave for an hour while kyle and britt ran to the store.

then dayna came home and we talked.=)

then kyle came home and britt left for a bit and i plucked kyle and daynas eyebrows.
kyles sucha a sissy. litterally only did about five hairs on each eye. lol
i was laughing so hard i started crying.

then britt came back over and they left a while later to go swim in her 100* pool.
boo.

so i stayed and talked to day until around 12:30 and then headed over to matt and aprils.

over there i got such a horrible headache and threw up 3 friggin times. it was awful.
i felt like an ass.
i finally went to sleep around 3 and woke up at 8.
great times.

cat: karla said me and you can stop over ANYTIME throughout the summer and lay out with dayna! YAY! i cant wait!i told her we were already planning on it;) haha. we're so CUTE!"

"event","well last night was a little wierd for me.
all i can say i is I LOVE CHURCH AND GOD.
im glad we all went together.=) like old times...

when we were at church, i got an amazing message from God.
his spirit was so THICK last night. pastor tommy asked us ""if your school made an announcement for all saved people to come to the office, how many ppl would actually check out of class?"" me and adrianna said there are prolly about 7-9 ppl in our senior class that are saved. and about 40 tops in the whole school. this made me really discouraged. we all have this awesome power of God and only 40 freakin ppl KNOW ABOUT IT?!...that really meant something to me.
then later he asked us to think about ""how many ppl in your life right now, know that you love god?"" I know that most of the kids in school who know me, know that fact about me. I pretty much surround myself by other spiritual ppl. but then again i thought to myself"" if i were to die right now... id want WAY more ppl to know about my faith"". it kills me that i know so many athiest'. there are so many that iam friends with. adn taht hurts me everyday, that ppl i love, dont know our lord. =/...
pastor tommy prayed for everyone in the building to be more bold when it comes to spreading the name and power of Christ. i really just want to be strong with it.

then later after service, guilt came upon me. you see, i was pretty much for sure drinking after prom. all my friends are doing it so i figured it'd be the only way to have fun... WRONG! while i was sitting in church i prayed about my choices. God just came over me with my change in decision. NO WAY! how could i even think it? so later at taco bell i called kyle to talk about it, i know he doesnt drink so i needed support. it helped. 

i kept thinking so much on the way home. i felt so guilty. it sucked.

then i talked to good ole' catherine and she said we can maybe go to oasis afterwards. :) thatd be awesome! then even we can maybe stop at jen's and say hi then leave, ya know? it wont be that bad... i always have fun with her! even though we are about to be put through SO much pain in exactly a week! eeps!

i just really want everyone in my life to know who GOd is and what he can do for you. he is an everlasting friend. I really just want to start taking more of my friends to church with me... kat(needs to start coming lol), catherine=), maybe? kyle...someday...thne anyone else who comes.it'd make me SO happy and fufilled!=) thats all i want in life. :)

please know im here to help anyone! even if you think you're doomed and god could never love you for what youve done or said. he always forgives and he will forever love YOU!!!"

And what it was like when we were together, 
Walking all along the beach, you were never far from my reach, 
And you held me through the stormy weather, 

[Chorus]
And I want to fall in love tonight, 
And I remember when you said ""everything's gonna be alright"" 
[Chorus Ends]

Laying in the summer grass, you told me not to talk so fast, 
As I told you how I feel, 
You made me feel right at home, 
You told me I was not alone and you knew just how I feel, 


I know we talked about it, I just can't get around it, 
I just want one more night with you, 


October air reminds me of all the seasons of your love, 
And what it was like when we were together 
The smell of fall is everywhere and though it seems, 
I just don't care, 'cause now you've gone away


that was for you catherine.
i love you.
i need our summers and our getaways..."

Won't you let me lend a hand

Til your everything is gone
You need someone to show you how to live again

I wanna be there when you're feeling high
I wanna be there when you wanna die
I'm gonna light your fire
Gonne feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when you're feeling' down
And I'll be there when your head is spinnin' round
Gonna be your lover
Gonna be your friend
I wanna be there til the end

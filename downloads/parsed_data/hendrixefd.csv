"event","wow... its all over!! i am officially done with high school! yesterday was graduation. It was absolutely amazing! Todd and I sang our song and it ended up going really really well! we were the only speaker/performer that got a standing ovation and everyone came up to us afterwards and told us how great we did... it felt really good to hear all of that, it just added to how good i was feeling already. That was the largest crowd I have ever performed in front of (5000) and it was actually the least nervouse i have ever been. I can't even describe what it feels like to be able to perform... I love it and im gonna do it for a living!! I know i can... and im gonna!

After graduation was the senior escapade. That was really fun too! First we had a hypnotist show then they took us all to gameworks. After playing video games and eating for a while, we went to Qwest field (the seahawks stadium). They rented it all out for us which was really cool. there was a shitload of stuff to do. They had henna, mechanical bull riding, dancing, karaoke (which i won!), food, gambling, an obstacle course, and a bunch of games and prizes. I ended up winning 50 bucks out of a drawing, some movie passes, some blockbuster gift certificates, and a prize for having the ""hottest lips"" (we had to put lipstick on and kiss a post it and they judged em). It was a good night, but i was exausted. I didn't get back home to bed til 7 in the morning. It was a long day, but totally fun! Im glad its all over though! BRING ON THE SUMMER!!!"

I did go to folk life festival on saturday with lillian and kyle which was quite fun! they got some hot henna tatoos! Sunday i pretty much worked in the yard all day and then had planned on going out that night but stuff fell through and i ended up spending an evening alone... go me! haha

today i sang at the edmonds memorial day ceremony thing then came home and napped. the rest of the day is a blur of laziness and boredom! wooot woot! 

so tomorrow is our spring concert which should be cool... im up for some awards so it'll be awesome if i win some! Oh! and i have my interview at Hollister at the Alderwood Mall... im crossing my fingers about that one! i really need a job to save up some money for NY!

In 3 months I will be on my way to NY! thats even crazier! ahhhh! Im really excited though! I know things will start happening there and it will be such an awesome experience. I just hope I don't miss all my friends and family too much... thats what Im most worried about!


So yea, the past month or two has been sooooo damn busy! I got pretty sick a few days ago cuz I haven't been able to just take a break a relax. I've been at school from 6:30 in the morning til at least 5 or 6 for extra choir/play pro rehearsals, and then multiple performances throughout that time on top of loads and loads of hw and projects that I've had to do. Then you have to tack on all the other senior stuff i've had to do... it gets insane. But i've survived and Im ready for it to come. We are gonna have one kick ass party on the 17th! Im hella stoked for that! 

Today I've got some yard work to do and some chores (gettin ready for the party 3 weeks in advance! haha) and then I think tonight I wanna go to a drive in or somethin! Buy yesh... shit is good for the most part... but man am i ready for a kick ass summer... Im gonna make it the best ever! I need to make some memories before I leave!"

Sometimes the world around me seems to be so cruel

I think of how love is lost among so much greed and animosity

Can the innosence and purity of life ever be saved? Will humanity ever see our common groud?

We want to live, we want to love, we want to be ourselvs, and be loved in return.

Today I see a small white flower growing in a patch of weeds. The thorns and overgrown brush seemingly unharming its fragile petals. And it gives me hope...

Yes we too will grow among adversity and struggle. For as long as the sun shines and we surround ourselves with those who truly care for us, we will bloom. And our beauty will surpass all...

I have hope"

I wish someone would have gotten a recording or something. But oh well...

Other than that, school has been going by so fast! I can't believe this friday is already April 1st! Dayum! I better think of some good April Fools jokes or something. I decided that I'm getting a job. I've narrowed it down to Starbucks, Abercrombie, Anthony's, Arnies, or Shell Creek Cafe. I would perfer the places with tips, but i'll take what I can get! I need some extra money before I head to NY at the end of the summer for college. Thats commin up fast too... god i can't wait! It still hasn't hit me that I will be living in NY next year...

the love life has been quite interesting. There have been some things that have happened, but i think for now i'll keep with the single life. I would love to have someone to give my heart to right now, but i don't think im still quite ready. Lots of stuff is still confusing... but im sure everything will work out the way it is supposed to in the end. Im a firm believer that everything happens for a reason!

We would have said hi but we were too embarassed... lol, oh well! We also got to see her guitarist (the one with the hot mohawk) up close, he was behind us for a while (again, we were too embarassed to say anything). But yea, the concert was really good. She sounded great, and YES she was singing live. She looked really hot! She had like 6 costume changes and her hair was long and straight... very sexy stuff. 
I always go to concerts and it makes me want to become a performer even more... Im gonna do it... I swear someday I will be on stage and you will be front row!! :)

The people there were so cool... they make you feel really comfortable. The piercing itself didn't really hurt at all... i mean i could definately feel it, but other than just a really hard pinch, it didn't make me cringe or anything. Now it kinda stings/burns a little... but thats normal. The only thing i have to deal with now is cleaning it. They told me what to do and gave me all the stuff for it so i should be fine.

I've been really busy practicing for the musical. Were doing Fiddler on the Roof at our school and I play Motel the Tailor! yay! come see it if you can! its march 24-25 at 7pm and the 26th at 2pm and 7pm @ the Mountlake Terrace theatre! Its fun rehearsing... we all make jokes and tease eachother about being arion jewish russians...its fun times...

So far I have gotten into 2 of my colleges that I applied for: California State Northridge and San Francisco State. They were both my safe schools. I really am hoping I get accepted to Marymount Manhattan. Its my dream to go to school in NY, so it would be nice to get an acceptance letter from them sometime soon. 

So it's valentines day and I have no one... not to sound like the cliche bitter person, but I guess it would be nice to have someone to be with tonight.

"event","so i got some good news and some bad news....


bad news first. I didn't get accepted into NYU. neither did todd... we're actually not that upset. The program we applied for only lets in 24 kids a year, so we knew it was gonna be takin a huge chance. Im just glad i got the letter so i can finish sending in all my other stuff for the other schools im applying to. Most likely, i will be heading to Cali... either USC, Cal State Northridge, or Sanfrancisco State! wooot wooot! either that or Berklee in Boston.

now the good news! ITS CHRISTMAS BREAK!!! thank god... i have been soooo busy the past 3 weeks with choir performances, the play, and school work! i woke up at 1:30 today! it felt so good to sleep in! Im really excited to hang out with everybody in the next two weeks! All i really have to worry about it the musical audition, and some ASL homeowork... I still need to go x-mas shopping! i haven't gotten a single thing! eeeek! 

well i need to go finish some chores.... h000ray!"

"event","hmmmm... what can i say? i guess life is goin pretty good... nothing to crazy or anything. I want to update, i just don't know what with! I guess i will do something i saw in a friends journal recently... you write about people from your friends list but don't put their names... some crazy little game i guess! So im gonns write about a couple of my friends (in no particular order) and maybe you'll be on it! you have to guess!

1. Wow... we've seen some crazy times. Definately a roller coaster friendship. It got pretty intense at times. You're a cool guy though... we had good times and i hope we can eventually get over all our shit. You are super talented with what you do and ummm... have a really nice taste in music, lol.

2. We pretty much became friends fast and then it slowed down fast too. We don't really hang out much anymore and that kinda sucks. You were so fun! I know stuff has happened with everyone, and we both are busy, but we need to hang sometime. Your ability to have fun and just be completely goofy is a really nice quality of yours!

3. Like most everyone on my friends list, we don't hang out to much anymore. I see you around quite a bit obviously, but its not like it used to be. I want to hang out with you soon, you're my favorite british person! we still gotta have our accoustic performances!!! aww, that night was so much fun! I care for you lots!! your like a brother of mine...

4. How can I not mention you?! you gave me the idea for this cool little thing. haha, we have had some really good times too! we seem to have gone seperate ways over the past year, but i can't help think of how fun it would be to catch up sometime and hangout. You are one of the few people who seems to have a strong, honest, view on things and i admire that about you. You also are very talented and I hope you are doin good! miss ya!

5. I've never met you... but someday I would love to! you seem like someone I could have a lot of fun with!! We have quite a bit in common, and you're a blast to talk to online! keep it real playa!

6. Im so glad we have started hanging out again! our crew can't be beat! lol! Our times last summer were awesome and hopefully we can make some new memories! You are crazy, but i love that! you are a loser too... but you cant help that you homeschooled, religious freak! jp... you rock my socks!

7.I admire you for so many things. You have been such an amazing person to me over the past several months. I really do admire your friendship! your incredibly easy to talk to and you always put a smile on my face. I have so many memories with you and I can't wait to make new ones! Thanks for everything!!


I can't think of everyone right now and my eyes are starting to hurt! i'll try to do some more maybe later! but for now, PEACE Y'ALL!"

"event","New York was sooo much fun!!! I just got back last night, and i already want to go back! I loved NYU, and the city itself is amazing!!

the first day we got there, we checked into our hotel and took a nap cuz we had been on the plane all night. Then we got up and headed to time square (so cool!), and ate at the bubba gump shrimp resturant. It was right across the street from mtv studios so we got to see Blink 182 doin their thing while we were eating. After that, me and todd headed to the virgin mega store. It was huge!! 3 storys of music and videos! haha, we saw that rapper guy, fabulous, there cuz he was signing autographs and stuff promoting his new album, lots of girls running around screaming. Later that night we met up with Hailly, our friend who graduated last year, she was gonna stay with us for 2 nights.

The next day was our tour of NYU. we had a tour guide and everything... it was really cool to see the campus cuz it was spread all over grenwitch village! they don't have one single campus, which i actually really like, and the dorms are huge!!! That night, me, todd, and hailly got all sexied up and headed down to this anniversary party thing for some club! It was hot... lots of dancing, and free shots! wooot woot! lol. John Norris from MTV news was even there! We got back to the hotel that night really late and woke up the next day at about 4 in the afternoon.

Friday was the night we saw Rent! i had never heard any of the music, and never seen any of it, so i was a complete virgin to the show! i loved it! it was soooo good, and the music is stuck in my head all the time now! I almost cried when the drag queen, Angel, died... it was sooo sad! the best part of it was probably afterwards cuz we stayed after and got to meet Drew Lachey (of 98 degrees, and played the lead), the other lead guy, and the guy that played Angel! they were so nice! definately made the night.

Satrday turned out the be the worst day. Not only was hailly gone, but i was stuck doing all the boring stuff. We had to go see the empire state buiding and the WTC site and walk FOREVER! nothing to exciting. At 5 headed to the airport, got some sushi, boarded our plane, and arrived last night in seattle at about 10:30! 

I WANNA GO BACK!"

"event","2 more days til NY! im sooo excited! i can't even think of everything i want to do! I know were gonna see a show, go shopping, visit NYU, and see ground zero, but other than that its up to us! hopefully me and todd will be able to hit up some NY clubs! that would be fun! Yesterday we speent all day shopping for the trip and we're still not done. I have to get a jacket and some sweaters cuz its gonna be chilly...

my back and neck are killing me! i must have slept wierd last night or something... its really tense, almost like its cramping or something... no fun! 

so i only go to school 2 days this week which is a relief. I need a break! i've been doing tests and essays for the past two weeks and its stressin me out. That, and the election... i can't believe what happened. I honestly think John Kerry would have made a better leader. He understands the concept of seperation of church and state, he has REAL experience with war, he had a progressive outlook on social security, healthcare, and our economy, and more personally for me, he had a much better understanding of the gay population. Sure he was unclear about some of his plans, but hasn't bush lied about his? ughhh, it just makes me sad that someone like Bush can be elected again, and that discrimination was ammended into 11 of our State constitutions.... im sorry for ranting, i just get really passionate about this kind of stuff. I mean, i should, its gonna affect me for the rest of my life. but Margaret Cho has been makin me feel better. I've been reading her online blog and i agree with everything she says!

""It just goes to show how incredibly dumb the Bush voters are. They are not treating this like an election, with many lives at stake with a full blown war being fought by our kids in Iraq; cataclysmic errors in national security causing our civil liberties to be severely crippled; too great a divide between the haves and the have-nots culminating in the worst economic situation in nearly eight decades; the threat to women's rights by insane religious fanatics seeking to ban abortion and therefore do away with equality; the aberration of freedom that is the Federal Marriage Amendment and the dehumanization of gay and lesbian Americans, etc, etc, etc. They are acting like it is some kind of sporting event, like their team won, and they are going to celebrate by doing beer bongs and hanging each other outside hotel windows by their big, stupid, un- evolved webbed feet. They see America like a giant tailgate party, and they are getting ready for the big game with Al-Quaeda."" -Margaret Cho

""I think Bush is probably really scared, if he is smart enough to be. He should be, because he has an enormously difficult task in front of him. There is no way he will regain public popularity. All he can manage to do is not fuck up too badly, which will probably prove to be impossible, as he is the rare maestro of the fuck up. Look at it this way. We might have some fun. Life is a tragedy for those who feel, and a comedy for those who think. It is vital to mourn for the victims of this government but not at the expense of losing our sense of humor. Our ability to laugh coincides directly with our ability to fight. If we can make fun of it, we can transcend it. Just imagine the incredible storm of shit that Bush will have to endure. It will make Hurricane Jeanne look like a humidifier. The polarizing of the population has been a wondrous gift to debate, and we are more politicized and aware than ever before. With all this caution and attention focused on our 'elected' officials, we have a moment where we can grasp the brass ring of self-government. In the immortal words of DMX, ""They don't know, who we be."" but they will, and they will be sorry."" -Margaret Cho

I love her!

School is school... not bad, not good... just school. Play Pro is actually pretty fun though! right now we're in the middle of auditions for ""Splendor in the Grass"". I'm hopin i get a good part! *crosses fingers*

The one thing that's kinda disapointing about this school year though is that the drama and gossip that i thought would end with the start of school is still lurking around. It seems to find its way to affect me no matter what I do. But i guess, the difference now is that i know not what to do about it and what i can do to not let it get to me. you live and learn.... AND THEN YOU GET LUVS!

Im gettin really excited to turn 18! only a week and a half!! woot woot! Its on a saturday so that should be fun! i think im goin to a strip club! haha <-- insert techno beats!

so to sum up my last few weeks: I sung at my sisters wedding (which was the same day as britneys! ironic!), school, remodeled kitchen and bathroom, play pro auditions, tried to relax, done college stuff, and hung out with cool peoples! 

Tomorrow i start my volunteer job at swedish hospital! woot woot! then friday im workin at my dad's, goin shoppin with Elizabeth and headin over to port townsend for a par-tay! ;)

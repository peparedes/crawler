"event","Once upon a time when I was 18 I came home from college a few pounds heavier than I left.  And my mom sent me to weight watchers.  I was, at the time, maybe 125 pounds.  Well I have binged myself up to 122 pounds and this time it's self-imposed.  I'm trying, very subtly, to ignore the fact that I have a problem cutting down a diet to nothing or defying it completely.  It helps that a bunch of girls at school are doing it with me, in fact, separate from the actual program but with our own meetings and old saved information

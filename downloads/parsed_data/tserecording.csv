"event","Well in a few hours we hit the stage at Taste of Chaos in Edmonton.  We are all pretty excited to playing a show this big infront of all our hometown friends and fans.  So hopefully you guys get a good show out of us tonight, or if you are reading this after the show, hopefully you liked all the new songs.

Right after the show we immediately start driving through the night back to Gibsons to resume and finish the record.  So it's gonna be a busy few days!  Cya when we get home...again....

Cheers.

"event","This recording experience has changed my view of music in leaps and bounds. I have a new found perspective on everything from writing to performing to arranging. I can see myself and the group developing as musicians. We are not at all finished but are beginning to see this project take shape and it is exciting. I cant wait for the people who have supported us every step of the way get a chance to hear what we have done. In other news, i am extrememly proud of Boots for standing up for himself to Sandy in the face of sexual harrasement. Also, I found a horseshoe, its fucking rad.

"event","So this is our last day here for a week.  We gotta come back home and play Taste of Chaos and Garth has to go win a Juno.

Pat & Sandy are all done their parts.  Dan finished all his main guitar tracks and Craig should do the same today.  When we get back they will be putting all their 3rd & 4th guitar tracks into all the songs.  I have finished 9 of 11 songs for the main vocal track.  We might start on some backups today but that along with all the harmonies and fun stuff will also be done in April when we get back.

I currently hold the course record with +2 in frizbee golf, I am pretty proud.  I have also attempted to grow a studio beard, but seeing how I can't grow facial hair, that is not going well at all.  BUT THAT WILL NOT STOP ME.  Can't wait to see everyone at home on Thursday.

Cheers.

"event","For all those who are interested, as of 11:30 this morning, the friendship between Boots the cat and myself has hit rock bottom.  I'm quite angry as boots took the liberty of taking a huge dump into our sink.  Not only did he poo in the sink but he also felt the need to make sure that both my toothbrush and my toothpaste were both at the bottom of the sink.  Well done boots, well done, it surely has come to game set match.  Maybe our friendship might be renewed in another time and or place but as of right now we are not on speaking terms.  Maybe i'll take a dump in his food dish, who knows, it's time to be creative....I'm dealin with a cat.
For now, Holla if you feel me!!!

"event","Alright here is the deal everyone.

Im in the studio right now just taking a break inbetween songs, and I thought I would give you all a heads up.  We are trying a new direction this album.  We are righting songs that people can actually understand.  God forbid, when you hear the lyrics of a song, you might even KNOW what it is about now.  After we put all our cards out on the table it was discovered that my songs only make sense TO ME which definitely is not what I was going for!

To make a long story short, prepare yourselves for some very different versions of Boys Will Be Boys and Point Blank, Victoria.  We have basically re-written every song we are recording because as a lyricist I just wasn't getting across what I wanted to get across in our songs, but it took until now for me to realize it.  BUT we are keeping Heartland almost the same no matter what so if you don't get what it's about thats too fucking bad!  

So hopefully most of you didn't have your heart set on 10 songs more confusing that a Sting ballad because this whole process was about really identifying who we are as a band, and having lyrics that are blanketed in metaphors that most people can't decifer is not who we are.  

One problem down.  Now if only I could learn how to spell.

Cheers.
Andrew"

"event","As of yesterday the band house we have been living in has welcomed a new roomie to the picture.  We have adopted a small stray cat and have named him ""boots"".  Boots is a fine cat and has held his end of the bargain by cleaning after us, and pooping on pats pillow case.  Boots has really turned a new chapter in his life, by finding new friends and a new place to live, life sure does look sweet.  As you can probably tell i have finished my bass tracking and am now trying to cope with the little free time I have.  So when i'm not wasted beyond recognition and getting lost in the forest, i am making boots a little backround story.  He is in fact a stray, and has been adopted, he does not clean nor poop on any pillow cases thus far.  He is however the sixth member of the TSE clan and hopefully enjoys his new home.
Other then that, the new songs and recordings are coming along swimmingly and i'm happier then a pig in shit.  Put yo' guns in the air if you feel me!!!
Peace out

"event","So the drums tracks have been finished now for 2 days and thats about teh same amount of time its been raining straight here.  Being couped up in a house with nothing more than a big screen TV and walls upon walls full of dvd's can get quite boring after a while as surprising as that might be.  On a positve note, before the rain started i managed to score a 5 over par on the 9 hole frisbee golf course on the ranch we're staying at.  im dying to get back out there but for now the tv and the 24 pack of beer will have to entertain me until the weather clears up. The guitars and bass are coming together quickly and its only a matter of time until this record realy starts to take shape as soon as possible we will have something for everyone to listen to just to keep your palates wet.  WE're halfay through season one of the sompranos and its time to watch another episode.  check often for updates.

"event","Pat finished his drum tracks Sunday night so we are onto bass and guitar.  I am trying to get Pat to come on and do a journal entry but all he does is get drunk all day and night and watch the Sopranos.  Eventually he will sober up though.

I am gonna try to figure out how to upload pictures because we have a digital camera and I would love to show everyone what the studio looks like.  And you may be shocked to learn that contrary to our press photos we don't look 16 years old still!  We are even gonna get new press photos when we get home to prove we have aged.

ATTN OILERS:  Stop playing like shit.

"event","I could totally see myself living in a place like this one day.

I wake up, go pet the horses, play a quick 9 of frizbee golf, have a coffee on the deck looking onto the Pacific Ocean.  Life is good.

PS...If I was you, I would stop listening to Boys Will Be Boys and Point Blank right now because the arrangements are gonna change, some lyrics are gonna change, they are gonna be new songs.  But all your Heartland die-hards will be stoked to here that the arrangement is very similar, we just cut it down a little so its not a 9 minute piece de resistance.

Cheers.

"event","Fuck yeah, I get the first update!

Its the morning of Day 3 and I am feeling good because we have satelitte TV in the band house, so we can watch the Oilers win the rest of the games along the way.  The new players seem to be doing what we wanted them to do, so I am stoked for a playoff run.

We got drums and pre-production done for 2 songs yesterday, one of them being Boys Will Be Boys.  The song is pretty much the same with some changes coming in the melodies, but just a warning to anyone who is familar with our other new songs: prepare for change.  

The origonal plan was that I was going to fly home on Sunday, but now that has changed, and I am going to be staying here for the entire process.  HOWEVER, I only packed for the weekend.  So I have two shirts, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and a pair of jeans to last me the next few weeks.  I already smell absolutely terrible, but not as bad as Pat who fell in horse shit yesterday while we were playing Frisbee Golf (i am sure there will be many entrees telling you all about Frisbee Golf).

Alright time for breakfeast and hopefully 3 more tracks today.

Cheers.

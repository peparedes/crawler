"event","I really hoped I would have been able to deal with this pain and just skip surgery. I guess it's really bad though and they got me in for later this morning. Surgery is scheduled for 7:20 but I have to be there at 6. It's like 4:45 and I've been up since 3 in pain. At least I went to bed earlier than usual today so I actually got some rest. I will get off of the comp and take my shower in about 20 mins and then Teresa will be here to pick me up at about 5:30. I just got done expelling all the bile in my stomach.....gross, I know....it tastes horrid! I am totally not looking forward to this.... Last night before Teresa went to bed she called me and told me that she was going to stay at the hospital the whole time instead of going home. I don't really know what to think about that fact....there's really no reason in my mind for her to stay other than moral support. I suppose that if it were me in her place and her in mine I would want to stay as well. I just don't want her to be sitting around worried or anything, not that it matters where she is, she'll probably still worry, I would a little bit. I guess Teresa's mom was worried because I didn't have any family here and no one would be at the hospital during the operation. Karl will be at home with the girls worrying too. I have to admit that having people worry about this and me just be mostly at peace with it is kind of strange. 

Keep me in your thoughts and prayers please. I know this is pretty routine and outpatient and everything but still....it'd be nice to know you guys are rooting for everything to go smoothly. You all know I'd do the same for you :)

Hope everyone has a great day. Not sure I'll be on much the next few days but take care all!! *HUGS*"

My husband, at the time, was in the Air Force stationed at home and we were awakened to a call from his parents asking if we'd seen what was going on. I turned on the tv and was in shock and awe as I watched the second plane crash into the tower. I thought it had to have been an accident, but then I heard the newscasters saying that it was believed to be terrorism of the most gruesome that had ever been seen here on US soil. I'm not exactly sure of what and who was responsible for the catastrophes of that day but, my heart ached for every one of the people who lost their lives and for the loved ones they left behind. Aaron was immediately called into work and they locked the base down tightly. I remember I sat alone as I cried so many tears that day and the days that followed. It truly was a trajedy of epic proportions and we all need to remember those who lost their lives and those who continue to lose their lives in war.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Hugs to all!! <br />  </div>"

Everyone read this for your children please!

Ok. I don't know where to begin because the last 2 days of my life have
been such a blur. Yesterday, My youngest daughter Halle who is 4, was
rushed to the emergancy room by her father for being severely lethargic and
incoherent. He was called to her school by the school secretary for being
""very VERY sick."" He told me that when he arrived that Halle was barely
sitting in the chair. She couldn't hold her own head up and when he looked
into her eyes, she couldn't focus them.
He immediately called me after he scooped her up and rushed her to the ER.
When we got there, they ran blood test after blood test and did x-rays,
every test imaginable. Her white blood cell count was normal, nothing was
out of the ordinary. The ER doctor told us that he had done everything
that he could do so he was sending her to Saint Francis for further test.
Right when we were leaving in the ambulance, her teacher had come to the
ER and after questioning Halle's classmates, we found out that she had
licked hand sanitizer off her hand. Hand sanitizer, of all things. But it
makes sense. These days they have all kinds of differents scents and when
you have a curious child, they are going to put all kinds of things in
their mouths.
When we arrived at Saint Francis, we told the ER doctor there to check her
blood alcohol level, which, yes we did get weird looks from it but they did
it. The results were her blood alcohol level was 85% and this was 6 hours
after we first took her. Theres no telling what it would have been if we
would have tested it at the first ER.
Since then, her school and a few surrounding schools have taken this out of
the classrooms of all the lower grade classes but whats to stop middle and
high schoolers too? After doing research off the internet, we have found
out that it only takes 3 squirts of the stuff to be fatal in a toddler.
For her blood alcohol level to be so high was to compare someone her size
to drinking something 120 proof. So please PLEASE don't disregard this
because I don't ever want anyone to go thru what my family and I have gone
thru. Today was a little better but not much. Please send this to everyone
you know that has children or are having children. It doesn't matter what
age. I just want people to know the dangers of this.
Thank you
Lacey Butler and family

""Alyssa Lies""
by: Jason Michael Carroll


My little girl met a new friend, 
just the other day, 
on the playground at school 
between the tires and the swings 

But she came home with tear-filled eyes, 
and she said to me ""Daddy, Alyssa lies"" 

Well I just brushed it off at first, 
'cause I didn't know 
how much my little girl had been hurt 
or the things she had seen. 
I wasn't ready when I said ""You can tell me"" 
and she said... 

""Alyssa lies to the classroom, 
Alyssa lies everyday at school, 
Alyssa lies to the teachers 
as she tries to cover every bruise"" 

My little girl laid her head down that night 
to go to sleep. 
As I stepped out the room
I heard her say a prayer so soft and sweet 
""God bless my mom and my Dad 
and my new friend, Alyssa 
oh I know she needs you bad 

Because Alyssa lies to the classroom, 
Alyssa lies everyday at school, 
Alyssa lies to the teachers 
as she tries to cover every bruise"" 

I had the worst night of sleep in years 
as I tried to think of a way to calm her fears 
I knew just what it was I had to do 
but when we got to school on Monday 
I heard the news 

My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad 
the lump in my throat grew bigger 
with every question that she asked. 
Until I felt the tears run down my face 
and I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today 

'Cause she doesn't lie in the classroom 
she doesn't lie anymore at school 
Alyssa lies with Jesus 
because there's nothin' that anyone would do 

Tears filled my eyes 
when my little girl asked me why 
Alyssa lies 
Daddy tell me why 
Alyssa lies

<u>
Streets of Heaven
</u>
by Sherrie Austin


<i>
Hello God, it's me again. 2:00 a.m., Room 304. 
Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war.
This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night.
I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.

Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me, what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own;
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven? 

Tell me God, do you remember the wishes that she made,
As she blew out the candles on her last birthday cake?
She wants to ride a pony when she's big enough.
She wants to marry her Daddy when she's all grown up. 

Well, it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me, what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
She's much too young to be on her own;
Barely just turned seven.
So who will hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven? 

Lord, don't you know she's my angel
You got plenty of your own
And I know you hold a place for her
But she's already got a home
Well I don't know if you're listenin'
But praying is all that's left to do
So I ask you Lord have mercy, you lost a son once too 

And it must be kind of crowded,
On the streets of Heaven.
So tell me, what do you need her for?
Don't you know one day she'll be your little girl forever.
But right now I need her so much more.
Lord, I know once you've made up your mind,
There's no use in beggin'.
So if you take her with you today, will you make sure she looks both ways,
And would you hold her hand when she crosses the streets of Heaven. 

The streets of Heaven.

<lj-cut text=""touching story of humanity"">

<b>
What would you do?....you make the choice. Don't look for a punch line, there
isn't one. Read it anyway. My question is: Would you have made the same
choice?
</b> 
At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children,
the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be
forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated
staff, he offered a question: ""When not interfered with by outside influences,
everything nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn
things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do.
Where is the natural order of things in my son?""
 
The audience was stilled by the query.
 
The father continued. ""I believe that when a child like Shay, physically and
mentally handicapped comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true
human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that
child.""
 
Then he told the following story:
 
Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were
playing baseball. Shay asked, ""Do you think they'll let me play?"" Shay's
father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their
team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play, it
would give him a much- needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be
accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.
 
Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting
much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, ""We're
losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on
our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.""
 
Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team
shirt. His Father watched with a small tear in his eye and warmth in his
heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted. In the bottom
of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by
three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the
right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just
to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father
waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team
scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning
run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.
 
At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the
game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all
but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly,
much less connect with the ball.
 
However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the
other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in
a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact. The
first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a
few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.
As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right
back to the pitcher.
 
The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could
have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and
that would have been the end of the game.
 
Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out
of reach of all team mates. Everyone from the stands and both teams started
yelling, ""Shay, run to first! Run to first!"" Never in his life had Shay ever
run that far, but he made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline,
wide-eyed and startled.
 
Everyone yelled, ""Run to second, run to second!"" Catching his breath, Shay
awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base.
By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball
... the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero
for his team. He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag,
but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the
ball high and far over the third-baseman's head. Shay ran toward third base
deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.
 
All were screaming, ""Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay""
 
Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by
turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, ""Run to third!
Shay, run to third!""
 
As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on
their feet screaming, ""Shay, run home! Run home!"" Shay ran to home, stepped on
the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game
for his team.
 
""That day"", said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, ""the
boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this
world"".
 
Shay didn't make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never
forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy, and coming home and
seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!
 
AND NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY: We all send thousands of jokes
through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending
messages about life choices, people hesitate. The crude, vulgar, and often
obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is
too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.
 
If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you're
probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren't the
""appropriate"" ones to receive this type of message. Well, the person who sent
you this believes that we all can make a difference. We all have thousands of
opportunities every single day to help realize the ""natural order of things.""
So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a
choice: Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up
those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?
 
A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it's least
fortunate amongst them.
 
You now have two choices:
1. Delete
2. Forward
 
 
 
May your day, be a Shay Day.

It has absolutely nothing to do with my post.

Finally got a new baby swing. Not the one that I wanted at first but it is nice and it works.

It's <a href=""http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=900002&e=storeproduct&pid=38314&section=inf_babygear"">this</a> cute lil number. We got it for about $10 less than that site sells it for though so that was nice. I still am in love with <a href=""http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/ref=br_1_2/602-8896197-8503017?ie=UTF8&frombrowse=1&asin=B000I5Q19Q"">this</a> one but...I take what I get :)

My sister was supposed to be here already so her and I could go out....but no...she takes her sweet ass time. I guess she bleached her hari and she said it made her look like Mila Jovovich or however you spell her name, her character on the move The 5th Element..I'm thinking this is a good thing when she tells me that it isn't and that she HAS to get her hair done before she leaves town because she doesn't want to go into work on Monday looking like that lmao.So her dumb ass is driving in the dark.

My mom wanted all of us to get pictures done so we went to the cheapest place we could fine. Wal-mart lol. I think the pics are going to be SUPER awesoem once they come in on the 12 of April I will scan them in and post of course. The two girls got individual ones and I wish the lady would have done one of them together instead of three of the baby and two of Mik....we only took two poses of each one though for our final package deal on top of the regular cheap ass package. Mikaela has a really sweet looking one and then a dramatic pose...it's great. Rheanna's are both angelic poses. Then in May Rheanna goes for the first set of 4 pics to be taken at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for a photo collage deal from a local studio here. That should be fun!! I LOVE PICTURES!!

I hope my sis gets here fine. 

OoOoOo I almost forgot. Bettina will be outta here come Tuesday morning if all goes as planned!!! I am super happy about that too. Tired of her leaving her son lay on the floor and letting him puke all over the place and not pick it up...among other things...hell I could go on and on and on....my mom has only been here a little over a week and she can't stand Bettina. Also she doesn't plan on paying us AT ALL for staying with us these past two months. :(

I'm a little nervous about my doctors appt on Tuesday afternoon. I hope it's all good news but everyone I talk to including my physical therapist seems to think that if all was well she would have just told me over the phone instead of having me pay for a damn doc office visit. I hope they're all crazy!! I am however looking forward to my first physical therapy water aerobics class on Wednesday and the second one of Friday then I'll go for the next 4-8 wks depending on how well I'm doing with PT every Monday Wednesday and Friday....I love the pool!! 

Come the end of May the pool here will be open and I can just go anytime I fancy. Took my om over to the hot tubs a couple nights ago and sat and chatted...that was fun. I'm gonna miss her when she leaves on Tuesday!!

That's all I can think of...off the top of my head."

<lj-cut text=""Making a pretty good point..."">
The Denver Post

THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT.

Denver Post:

This text is from a county emergency manager out in the  central part of  
Colorado after todays snowstorm.

WEATHER BULLETIN

Up here, in the Northern Plains, we just recovered from a Historic event--- 
may I even say a ""Weather Event"" of ""Biblical Proportions"" --- with a 
historic blizzard of up to 44"" inches of snow and winds to 90 MPH that 
broke trees in half, knocked down utility poles, stranded hundreds of 
motorists in lethal snow banks, closed ALL roads, isolated scores of 
communities and cut power to 10's of thousands.

FYI:

George Bush did not come.

FEMA did nothing.

No one howled for the government.

No one blamed the government.

No one even uttered an expletive on TV

Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton did not visit.

Our Mayor did not blame Bush or anyone else.

Our Governor did not blame Bush or anyone else, either.

CNN, ABC, CBS, FOX or NBC did not visit - or report on this category 5 
snowstorm.  Nobody demanded $2,000 debit cards.

No one asked for a FEMA Trailer House.

No one looted.

Nobody - I mean Nobody demanded the government do something.

Nobody expected the government to do anything, either.

No Larry King, No Bill O'Rielly, No Oprah, No Chris Mathews and No Geraldo 
Rivera.

No Shaun Penn, No Bar bara Striesand, No Hollywood types to be found.

Nope, we just melted the snow for water.

Sent out caravans of SUV's to pluck people out of snow engulfed cars.

The truck drivers pulled people out of snow banks and didn't ask for a 
penny.

Local restaurants made food and the police and fire departments delivered 
it to the snowbound families.
Families took in the stranded people - total strangers.

We fired up wood stoves, broke out coal oil lanterns or Coleman lanterns.

We put on extra layers of clothes because up here it is ""Work or Die"".

We did not wait for some affirmative action government to get us out of a 
mess created by being immobilized by a welfare program that trades votes 
for 'sittin at home' checks.

Even though a Category ""5"" blizzard of this scale has never fallen this 
early, we know it can happen and how to deal with it ourselves.

""In my many travels, I have noticed that once one gets north of about 48 
degrees North Latitude, 90% of the world's social problems evaporate.""

It does seem that way, at least to me.

I hope this gets passed on.

Maybe SOME people will get the message.  The world does Not owe you a 
living.

"event","I went inactive with my MaryKay business so now I am back at it. I will probably be sending all of my friends eCards or possibly even some mailers. If you hate me for it I'm sorry but everyone's got to make money somehow and this is definitely something I can do on my own time and at my own pace. I NEED to try and sell 1200 dollars worth of product by the end of this month so if anyone is interested in buying anything let me know please :) There are plenty of great products available to choose from even some for men :D 

This is most definitely going to be a good thing....it will get me out of the house and I will get to meet new customers as well as see some old faces from the area. I am really excited about getting back in the swing of things, so wish me luck!!"

"event","I hope that one of you smart lj'ers can figure this puzzle out for me. 

We've been trying like crazy to figure it out, and although it looks simple, we can't seem to get our minds around it and solve the darn thing. Here's what it looks like....my own little sketch sorry for the crappiness of it...just did it quickly.

<b>Edited out since I finally figured it out.</b>

SORRY FOR THE SIZE

The rules of the puzzle are that there are seven gems that need to be placed in the circles along the outsides. You have to place them in a slot and then slide them into one of the two spots connected to each circle. You can't put a gem on top of an already in place gem and you need to fill seven of the eight spots with gems. I hope that is clear and understandable.

Any help would be MUCH appreciated!!!

and ty in advance :)"

"event","I found this new instant messenger service that is unlike any other I have ever used, and I am loving it. It's 3D so more fun and you can interact with the people you are chatting with on a 3D lvl. I sent a lot of you an invite so check your junk mail lol cause it's from the site mail so it may have gone there and not to your inboxes....just take a look I promise it is fun and takes no time at all to learn. You can even become a developer and make your own virtual clothing and other items to sell for credits. Credits can be used to purchase tons of cool things for your Avatar. You get 1,000 free credits just for signing up!! If I didn't have your e-mail then you didn't get an invite...so if you want an invite just let me know. You also get a free webpage to play around with....forgot to mention that part. I would love to chat in virtual 3D with all of you!"

by Virginia Satir

Virginia came to write this poem when she was working with an angry fifteen-year-old girl who had a lot of questions about herself and what life meant.

I am me.

In all the world, there is no one exactly like me.

There are persons who have some parts like me,

but no one adds up exactly like me.

 

Therefore, everything that comes out of me

is authentically mine because I alone choose it.

I own everything about me

including everything it does;

including all its thoughts and ideas;

including the images of all they behold;

whatever they may be...

anger, 

joy, 

frustration, 

love, 

disappointment, 

excitement 

and all the words that come out of it

polite, 

sweet or rough,

correct or incorrect; 

  loud or soft.

              And all my actions, whether they be to others or to myself.

 

I own my fantasies, my dreams, my hopes, my fears.

I own all my triumphs and successes, 

all my failures and mistakes.

Because I own all of me I can become intimately acquainted with me.

By doing so I can love me and be friendly with me in all parts.

I can then make it possible for all of me to work in my best interests.

 

I know there are aspects about myself that puzzle me, 

and other aspects that I do not know.

But as long as I am friendly and loving to myself,

I can courageously and hopefully, look for solutions to the puzzles 

and for ways to find out more about me.

 

However I look and sound, whatever I say and do, and whatever I think
and feel at a given moment in time is me.

This is authentic and represents where I am in that moment in time.

When I review later how I looked and sounded, what I said and did, and how I
thought and felt, some parts may turn out to be unfitting.

I can discard that which is unfitting, and keep that which proved fitting, 

And invent something new for that which I discarded.

 

I can see, hear, feel, think, say and do.

I have the tools to survive, to be close to others, to be productive, 

and to make sense and order out of the world of people 
and things outside of me.

I own me, and therefore I can engineer me.

"event","Saw this on Skip's LJ and thought I'd give it a shot.  I don't really have any creativity so who knows what you'll get :D  


First seven people to respond to this post with the line ""OOH! OOH! PICK ME!!"" will get something made by me for their very own. 


Conditions?

--I get to choose what I make. You can choose whether or not to be grateful. I vote grateful. But that's only if I follow through and give you the something made by me for your very own. If over six months pass and you've gotten nothing, you may feel free to send angry letters to the management.

--If you expect something in the mail, I suggest you double check with me, via e-mail or something, as to whether I have your address or not.

--I'll ask you some questions as to what you might like only if I can't think of anything on my own. But since what I make is of my choosing, I also reserve the right to not tell you what pretty pretty thing you are getting until you actually get it. In fact, chances are that the gift I make will be a surprise to you. Isn't this fun?

--You could get something very strange. I'm just saying.

--Here's the biggie, and the one you've all been waiting for: The catch is that you have to repost this in your own journal, in your own words or in mine or in someone else's. You post it in your journal and offer to make gifts for other people, just like I'm offering to make gifts for you. If you do not post this in your journal within a day of replying to my entry and I actually notice that you don't post it, I strike you from the list and you don't get a pretty pretty.


So, thems the rules. Here's the summary for anyone who just skimmed it: Respond to this post with the correct line; get stuff. Then make a post like this in your journal; other people get stuff.


The List:
1. drifterskip
2. tobimonkee
3. flaxeloquent
4. ??
5. ??
6. ??
7. ??"

"event","As always I had major butterflies in my stomach on Monday when I got to meet half of my students.  There were already some that drove me crazy.  On Tuesday I got to meet the other half.  They worked better together.  Then we put them all together Wednesday.  I have twenty-two four year olds.  It doesn't sound like much, but it feels like a lot.  I think it's going to be a really interesting year.  I have some students who know nothing.  Not even their colors.  Others know a little bit of everything.  

One little boy is going to be the death of me.  He's very smart, but likes to copy what others are saying.  It could be the simplest thing he gets fixated on it and just repeats it a few times.  But even with that being annoying he's still really cute.  I told him to move to a different spot so he wouldn't talk and I called him sweetheart.  He responded, ""Okay pumpkin.""  He has since referred to me as either pumpkin or mommy.  I'm wondering if he even remembers my name.

This year I also seem to have a lot of children with unusual relationships to each other. Two boys live together, and have since birth (with their moms), but don't seem to be related.  Two girls live together (with thier moms), one mom is the godmother of the other.  One grandma is the godmother of the father of another student (points if you followed that one).  Another boy is the godson of the mom of a former student of mine.

I'm looking forward to working with all of this kids and seeing how much they can and will learn throughout the year.  Some of them have already started repeating what I say, which means I need to be careful :)"

"event","I have finally finished moving into the apartment.  Everything is how I want it (at least at the moment).  The cable guy was here forever and I now I have cable, internet, and a phone.  So very exciting!  I'm getting used to being on my own - although there has been lots of trips back to the house.  

Sadly, I have to return to work on Tuesday.  I'm not really looking forward to it.  From all the gossip I've heard, it's going to be a rough year.  We're going to have one person in charge of the early childhood stuff who has already said she's going to make us hate her with the amount of work she's going to give us - I'm not really sure if she's joking or not.  At least I'll get a brand new start with new students.  Can't wait to get the class list :)"

"event","Spending the past couple days with Michie and Kat reminded me that I've been ignoring LJ.  Kat showed me how to organize it so that I get reminders that someone updated so that should help me remember.  

The trip to NJ/PA was wonderfully fun.  I got to spend a lot of time with Michie and Kat, which doesn't happen very often.  I had such a great time just hanging out and talking.  And I learned the evils of vegetables - they taste like despair.  Also, got to shop a little :)"

"event","1)  I suck at updating and reading LJ, but I think that goes without saying.

2)  Kids can throw up through their noses.  Their teachers then have to clean it up.  Not something I ever want to do again.  It smells.

3)  Four year olds will repeat anything and everything that you say.  

4)  They also don't like when you cut your hair.

5)  I was supposed to have an observation today, but the principal cancelled on me.  I should have it Monday.

6)  Is it Spring Break yet?

7)  One child sneezed on another, and she told me, ""He bless youed in my hair.""

8)  I have a smart class.  I asked for a word that rhymed with 'bus' and one child told me 'discuss'

9)  I love all my kids.  Even the terrors who drive me crazy, and I think want to kill me.

10) I miss my friends.  We need to do something soon.  But not this weekend :)"

"event","I'm actually updating, aren't you proud of me?  I got to hang out with friends yeseterday, even if just for a little while. I hope you guys had fun at Margo's.  Dreamgirls is an excellent movie.  I think everyone should see it.  It's really fun when the people around you talk to the people in the movie :)  Just got off the phone with Margo about hanging out Saturday.  Of course, I'm taking the Praxis II for early childhood that morning, and am always drained after test-taking. Then the Ravens are playing the Colts in the playoffs that afternoon.  My parents are going to the game and would kill me if I didn't watch it.  I told Margo if I'm still awake I'll call her and find her to hang out. If not then another day/night.

I don't want to go to work tomorrow.  Weekends are too short.  But I do miss my kids.  I just don't feel like waking up early.  Oh well.  It will be fine."

"event","Well, it's been forever since I've last updated or read LJ.  I just always forget.  I'll try to do better this upcoming year.  I just reread my last LJ entry.  It was posted three days before my Aunt died.  My whole family is still in shock about that day.  Nothing like getting a call in the middle of the night that she took a turn for the worst and then being in her hospital for hours just waiting.  Not an experience I ever thought I'd go through.

It seems like August was so long ago.  So much has happened.  After my Aunt's funeral I started work.  Things were crazy there like always.  I was teaching first grade, what I always wanted.  Then there was lots of stress and drama, and the first week of November I was pulled from my class to teach preK (which I now love).  I spent the rest of November and pretty much all of December writing lesson plans for the first grade sub, while planning and teaching for preK.  Luckily, they now have a new teacher in first grade and I can offically stop doing stuff for first grade.  

My preK kids are wonderful and so cute and mostly innocent.  Although they do know curse words, they just say them when telling me they're not supposed to say them.  Like the student who said, ""You don't say bitch to your friend.""  Or the boy who thought I said a word other than ship.  He told me to say boat instead.  Another child asked me why I was teaching them, she said I just followed them from lunch one day and never left.  Which I guess is true.  I get called mom a lot, which I'm getting used to.  I never realized how much help four year olds needed until I started helping with shoes, buttons, zippers and tissues.  What fun.  But it is amazing to see them starting to get something.

There really hasn't been much time for things other than work.  If you think writing lesson plans for one grade is a lot, try doing it for two.  But now I may actually have free time.  I'm hoping anyway.  Guess that's everything that's been going on in my life.  Sorry it's  not that interesting.  

I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas or had a Happy Hanukkah."

"event","Last Tuesday my Aunt went in for a Whipple operation for pancreatic cancer.  She was doing well on Wednesday, sitting up and attempting to talk to us even though she had a tube down her throat.  That night she started having trouble breathing, and had some other issues as well.  When the doctors removed the tumor somehow they ended up hitting an artery or something near the liver depriving it of blood for four to five hours.  This set off a chain of problems.  Her liver not working caused the kidneys to have problems, then she might have a blood clot in her lungs.  The doctors aren't sure that her kidneys will recover but they are remaining optimistic.  SHe now has a bacterial infection, and if we want to go close to her we need to wear a gown and gloves.  

It's been very difficult for my mom and grandmother.  My grandmother just had major surgery for an arotic aneurism the beginning of June, and at her age (80) this is really taking a toll on her.  Tomorrow we're all going to have a meeting with the doctor.  I'm holding on to hope that everything will be fine.  My Aunt will have a long recovery period, but she'll be okay.  I don't want to think of any other outcome.

On happier news, I'm offically teaching first grade everything.  Just have to start planning now.  I'm looking forward to it, especially since I sorta know what I'm doing now.

I hope everyone else is doing well.  off to read your live journals :)"

Ocean City was lots of fun, but so very hot.  You could feel heat as soon as you stepped outside.  However, I was brave and went out there to go shopping :)  The beach was fun although yesterday a wave knocked me over and made me hurt my ankle and knee (at least it wasn't broken).  Only one broken body part at a time for our friends, hehe.

"event","I really wish I could get all these papers done.  I have no motivation, and I'm having a hard time sitting here working on them.  Classes end the 25th.  I'm almost there.

So I found some interesting things on my attempt to not do work today.

http://community.livejournal.com/sapatos/  This site is for Michie.  I saw it and thought of her.  Not sure why though, must be the shoes, hehe.

I took this quiz: 
http://quizilla.com/users/kukamunga/quizzes/Which%20Romantic%20Comedy%20Heroine%20Are%20You%3F/ 

You're Katherine ""Kiki"" Harrison
(Julia Roberts - 'America's Sweethearts')

Always the shoulder to cry on, you try to juggle the lives of those you care about while battling with your own. You have a beautiful smile, a wonderful sense of humor and charming wit, but often go unnoticed. Too many times others get the spotlight, but that's ok by you. You don't need the limelight, you just want that special someone to recognize you for the loveable and loving person you are.

You're booksy, artsy, and creative. You prefer toned down, subdued classic clothing to express your personality. 

You do have a hard time expressing yourself outwardly, and often turn to some 'thing' for comfort, while you carry the brunt on your shoulders.

You're ambitious and professional and succeed at everything you tackle.

Lastly I found this on a random website.  It explains how to properly write a letter to Santa Claus
https://hdusps.esecurecare.net/cgi-bin/hdusps.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=sUdhCyOh&p_faqid=495&p_created=1048124676&p_sid=NiuKLBci&xssl=1

As you can see, I don't feel like doing work.  But now I must or else it won't get done and I'll be screwed."

"event","Spent the day spending time with my grandma, and trying to get motivated to tackle work for Goucher. My grandma seemed really depressed today.  I'm trying to figure out if she's just frustrated with her recovery taking a while, or if she doesn't really want to go home.  She didn't do much today, probably the least amount she's done since she's been here.  I hope she okay.  Although, I have to say, I'm so tired of Law and Order.  That show is on so darn frequently.  That's all we watch.  It's funny though because she tells us at the beginning that she's seen it but doesn't remember the ending.  Of course, that means we must watch. Sigh.  

Saw this in Kat's journal so here it is:
01. Tell me something obvious about you.
02. Tell me something about you that many don't know.
03. What is your biggest fear?
04. Do you normally go the safe route or take the short cut?
05. Name one thing you want that you can't buy with money.
06. What is your most treasured possession?
07. What is the one thing you hate most about yourself that you do often?
08. Tell me something sexually about you that I don't know.
09. Tell me something sexually about you that everyone knows.
10. What is your favorite lie to tell?
11. Name something you've done once that you can't wait to do again.
12. Are you the jealous type?
13. What is the one person, place or thing you can't say no to?
14. What is the nicest thing someone has ever done for you?
15. If you could do something crazy right now, what would it be?
16. When was the last time you cried?
17. When was the last time you felt so good that nothing else mattered?
18. Do you feel comfortable in public with no shirt on?
19. Name something embarrassing you did while being drunk.
20. If you post this in your journal would you like me to answer it?"

"event","So I finished two days of training for the new math curriculum.  Even though I don't know what I'll be teaching next year I went to the second grade workshop.  The program is scripted and the city is creating a grid that tells us what to teach and when to teach it.  Everything is done for us.  Which in a way is good, more time to do the million other things that I'll need to do, but then why did I just spend four years learning how to be a teacher, spend my summer going to classes for my masters if everything is going to be scripted out?  I know I'll still have to get the behavior piece down, but I actually enjoyed being creative with my lesson plans, which I guess I can still do.  Does that even make sense?

My grandma is still living with us as she recovers from her operation.  She is doing excellent for an 80 year old woman who had her stomach cut open and her insides moved around (she had an aneurism).  She had a few set backs in the hosptial but she is doing really well.  She gets out of breath a lot, but for her age I guess that's normal.  It's been interesting having her here.

It feels weird not working with my students, which must be why I'm not going to be tutoring for an hour or two a week.  I just can't stop ;)"

"event","Yesterday was the last day of school.  I've surived my first year of teaching.  The day ended at 11:30, and I had everything checked out but my evaluation with the principal.  I was there until 4:00, which I finally got to see the vice principal.  I was almost late for my grad class at Goucher becuase they made me wait so long.  My evaluation was satisfactory (there are only three levels), and there were no surprises on it.  Basically, I have to get that whole classroom managment thing down ;)  I don't know what grade I'll be teaching yet next year.  The vice principal said she'd call me when they know, but I'm not going to hold my breath for that one.

Only one of my students is being retained (and out of 41, I think that's not too bad).  Most of my kids kicked butt on the Stanford Ten test.  The best story of the day however, involves one of the sweetest and craziest kids I've ever meet.  He has decided that he wants to stay with me in second grade again next year.  I tried telling him I might not be in second grade next year, but he won't listen.  He thought it would be a good idea to cross out on his report card that he was being promoted to third grade, and write in that he was being retained.  I called his mom and we had a good laugh.  I'm really going to miss all my  kids.

One good thing though is I'll actually have time to be online and hang out with friends. :)  Even if I am taking 8 credits of grad classes, that's less work then teaching full time.  My grandma will be here for a while, but at least she'll be out of the hospital (she's supposed to be released today).

I hope that everyone else is doing well.  I appreciate all the support and understanding from everyone throughout this year. You guys are the best!"

"event","I went back to Goucher today for my graduate class.  I left school extra early to get there early so I could see if anyone was in.  I got to speak to Rick, LaJerne, Ann Marie and of course my prof for the semester Dr. Velder.  It was wonderful to speak to Rick.  I've missed all of them so much.  Sadly, Brian wasn't there, and Rick hasn't seen him yet.  It seems Brian went deep into his sabatical and Rick hasn't spoken to him for a while.  Jean is retiring from the psych department.  Rick suggested that I journal more, so I'm going to try and write more often, but I also need to be reminded to read journals too :)

I have two funny quotes from Friday.  One little boy asked me if he could use the bathroom and I told him to wait a moment.  He replied, ""You have to let me go now.  If you don't let me go, my balls are going to get soggy.""  I just died laughing.  I couldn't even try to not laugh.  Then later that day we were sitting around reading a story when one boy moved his chair to where this little girl was sitting (she had gotten up to get a tissue).  She came back and said, ""Ms. McCarty he took my pot.""  Another little girl turned around and said to her, ""It's sp-sp-sp-spot.""  Hehe.  I love my kids.

I'm actually excited about my class with Dr. Velder, although I have to say, not as much fun without Shoshana and Margo to write notes with.  I have one Velder quote.  There is a rubric on our syllabus, and he looks at it and says, ""I have no idea what a rubric is, but the state wants us to have one.  A former student made it for me. I  guess 5's the highest grade.  Whatever that means.""  Or something to that effect.  I love Dr. Velder.  I'm so glad to be back at Goucher.

Off to finish up my report cards.  Hope everyone is doing well :)"

"event","I have an insane amount of work to do.  I was at school until a little after 6, and I still had to bring things with me, but I had to share some things.  Yesterday, I had a meeting with a set of parents who always stand me up for conferences.  It was the parents, their son, me and the principal.  We decided to to a behavior chart for the child, and I created it last night.  I handed it in to the princpal this morning.  SHe called down to my room and said she liked it.  She also wrote ""excellent"" on the note I had attached.  Later, she visited my room.  Left.  Then came back.  When she came back she whispered in my ear that things were looking ""great.""

Now, I was on Cloud Nine here because this lady has never really given me a compliment like that before.  Ever.  Then I get to lunch and check my cell phone.  I have a voicemail from my mom.  I panic a little because she doesn't normally call.  I listened to the message and she was letting me know that my princpal had called her to tell her that she was proud of the improvements that she has seen.

Yes.  The princpal called my mom.  I still can't believe she did that.  She said she tells her teachers to call the parents of the students when they're doing good, and she wanted to do the same thing for her new teachers (which, I think I'm the only first year teacher there).  The principal said that she has seen that my behavior managament has improved since I've started working with my new mentor.  I can't even begin to say how much that meant to me.  I've been struggling for so long that to have her actually say something like that really meant a lot.  I look forward to seeing her tomorrow so I can thank her.  I hope this means that things will keep getting better.  I had a wonderful day because of this. I know that bad things will still happen, but maybe I actually know what I'm doing :)

So I just had to gush about that.  Now back to work because I have so many charts and stuff to make.  Thanks for letting me get that out of my system, hehe.  Hope everyone is doing well."

Now, New Year's resolutions.  Should I even bother?  I know I won't keep them.  It's the usual stuff anyway.  Exersice more.  Eat less.  Keep my room organized.  Don't let school eat my life away.  Actually read people's LJs so I can keep updated on their lives (you know in case school does eat my life away).  Go out more.  Add to my lovely collection of friends.  Darn.  I know most of that won't happen, so I guess I should throw in saving the world too :)  Although world peace would be nice.

And on that note, I think I was on the phone too long, hehe.  In such a silly mood.  Hope everyone is enjoying their start to 2006!"

"event","I was just reflecting earlier on how much I've learned in such a short time and I wanted to share some of the things I realized. 

10. I'm not white.  I'm light-skinned or mixed depending on which child I'm talking to.  One child in particular gets very angry if someone calls me white. Which leaves me with the dilema that I don't know how to respond.  I am white, but if I say that to him he just gives me this look and says, ""No.  You are light skinned."" 

9. Even children who look little are very strong.  They can lift desks up above their heads.  They can almost pull you over trying to break free so they can go ""bang"" someone.

8.  Even the children who are craziest, some days just need a big hug.  And some like to squeeze you so hard you think you're going to throw up.  But it's still a hug.

7.  The best notes you'll ever get are from a child who drives you crazy, but tells you that you're the best teacher and they love you. This is even more meaningful when they have stolen the paper to write the note from your desk without permission.  It's really cute though when they label it a love note.

6. Don't take things personally.  I am not a bad teacher no matter how many times people try to make me feel like I am.  THere are a lot of people out there who want me to fail, but I can do better than that.  I will be a great teacher one day, I just have to learn and grow.

5. Kids say funny things.  I always knew that one, but it's very difficult not to laugh when you're trying to teach. Some examples: If someone tells you to smoke or they'll call you a baby, all you have to do is ""kick them in the nuts.""  Children don't believe you when you say Ms. is your first name, they want to know your ""human name.""  And no, I wasn't alive when the dinosuars were.  I could keep going, but I won't.

4.  I really, really, really miss my life at Goucher.

3.  You can really impress children by knowing things in pop culture.  I sang part of a Gwen Stefani (or however that is spelled) song and you should have seen the way their jaws dropped.  THe next day my one little girl came up to me shaking her head, ""Ms. McCarty, I still can't believe you knew the bananas song.""

2.  I have wonderful friends who put up with the fact that I really don't have a life.  I need to start reading LJs more often so I don't feel so disconnected from everyone.

1.  I still have so much to learn :)"

I haven't had my post-observation conference yet.  The kids were still crazy, even though the principal was in the room, but I'm sure she'll blame it all on me.  The lesson went pretty well, the small group part did not.  I have been really bad with doing it so the kids didn't really know what to do, I thought we'd be able to practice this week, however, it really didn't work out since I had a day to prepare.

Everyone was telling me that they have to give us at least a week before they come in.  Seems like everyone was wrong.  She'll be in tomorrow at 8.  I'm so scared and nervous.  I hate being observed.  I'm sure she'll pick me apart. I've heard it all depends on what kind of mood she's in and if she likes you or not.  Sigh.  I just want to call out tomorrow.  I could also type up a rant about the adminstartion and report cards, but I'll leave that for another time, I have so much stuff to do.

On the plus side, it isn't the kids who are driving me crazy.  The end of last week and so far this week, it's been the administration.  I guess I can't expect all to be perfect.

"event","Last night I got to hang out with friends, so much fun.  Happy birthday Shoshana!!  I guess having fun there made up for the fact that today was horrible.

It started off badly.  I woke up with a sinus headache.  Then in class one student was off the wall.  It was 8:30 and already he needed a time out.  I got them in my room at 8:10 after switching.  I then had to call his guardian and had him talk to this student on my cell phone, which he almost didn't give back.  Then about twenty minutes later, he throws a student on the floor - while we're having a discussion about what we can do to improve the behavior in our classroom.  So I call down to the office because I need help.  He is out of control, crying, running out of the classroom.  The guy who is in charge of dealing with crazy kids, comes in, sees my student crying and says to send him to the principal with another student.  This child won't go.  I can't get him to leave.  He's trying to rip the referral form from my hands.  And I'm supposed to let another student walk down with him?  THen he runs out of the building saying that he is going home.  I can't chase after him.  So I called down the office, luckily he came back on his own. My mentor teacher came up and she took him out.  They talked to his guardian and she later told me why he was acting up.  It seems he felt his pants were too short and since his guardian would not iron him another pair to wear to school, he was angry. His pants were fine!  Sigh.

Then I'm talking to the guy who didn't help me at all when I needed him, and he says something that really pissed me off, and almost made me cry right there in front of my kids.  He told me, and I quote, ""Something is going to change in your classroom.  They're getting a new teacher.""  I told him I did not find that funny, and he just kept on going talking about what they're going to do about one of my crazy students.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but I'm still pissed about what he said.  It's unprofessional, and cruel considering that I am having trouble with my kids and feel as if I'm not doing a good job.  I had to go into the bathroom to keep from getting really upset.

I could go on and on, but I have to rewrite the letter I put together to send my kids.  Can I just say that if you want something in a specific format, tell me before I do it my own way.  What a day!"

"event","I had a nasty headache on Sunday.  I've had the same one on and off all week.  I'm tired of it.  I think it's stress.  I have one now because I had to yell at my kids all day.

It has been two weeks since Kelli died.  Today we got her ashes back in a box.  They are sitting on the fire place.  My parents are a mess.  They keep asking me if I'm okay, and telling me that I don't need to be strong for them.  I'm not trying to be strong for them, I'm just trying not to cry because I know if I do, I just might not stop, and then lesson plans won't get written, tests won't get graded, and I wouldn't survive in my classroom.  We all miss our puppy so much.  I think it hurts so much since we didn't expected it.  I never even got to say goodbye.

Now to school.  The kids are determined to kill me I've decided.  They talk, and talk, and talk.  They won't shut up, but as soon as my mentor teacher steps into the room the stop.  They are driving me crazy.  And I think the behavior is getting worse with some of the kids.  I'm trying the suggestions that I'm getting, but I'm very frustrated.  I talked with a teacher today who has been teaching for about 25-30  years.  She is having similar issues with her kids talking, which made me feel better.  ALthough if you've been teaching that long and it still happens, then I'm screwed.  SHe did offer some suggestions and said that when she walks by my room, it doesn't seem that horrible.  I think one difference though is the fact that my kids fight each other once in a while, and I'm guessing hers don't.  She said the kids are horrible and they are ""bad-tail"" kids.  I wondering if that's the old fashion saying for ""bad-ass.""  I felt better after talking with her.

I gave a math test on Wendesday and out of my fourty kids, only about 8 failed.  I was so excited.  One kid got a zero on his pre-test, and got a 100% on his post-test.  This is a child with an IEP who is trying every day to kill me.  He has the brains, now we just got to get his behavior under control.  A lot of the kids improved which just shows that I can teach, if the behavior would just fix itself.  I think I'm going to have to start bribing them to be good.  I don't know what else to try.  I've done the nice teacher, the bitchy teacher, the grouchy teacher, the angry teacher, and I don't think they work.  I need to find the perfect middle ground.

I'm excited because tomorrow I'm doing something non-school related.  My teammates and I are going out to lunch at the Olive Garden and my one teammate is bringing her baby.  It will be nice to hang out with them outside of school, even if they make me feel like I'm a baby, hehe, one is 34 and the other is 30.  Also, I think I'm going to be hanging out with friends Monday after school too.  So very excited for that, I can't even say.

I'm sure there is more ranting I could do, but instead I'm just going to relax.  I was going to write lesson plans but, I don't feel like it, and that can wait until tomorrow."

My parents picked her up this morning to take her to our vet who knows her history.  They were going to do some tests to see what was wrong with her.  Unfortanately, she didn't make it.  She died this afternoon.  I know all of you know how much my parents and I loved her, so right now we're all incredibly sad, especially since the vet seemed optimistic that everything was going to be just fine.

"event","So I had an okay day I guess.  My mentor teacher continues to take over my classroom, refering to it today as her classroom.  My usually problem children continue to be just that.  I have to turn in progress reports on Monday, and they just gave them to us today at 3:00.  Since I have bad behavior management skills, we haven't done a lot it feels like so I don't really feel I can determine if my chidlren need improvement or not.

Some better stories.  In math today this was the word problem I gave using my children as manipulatives: ""Three kids are eating lunch with me.  Six children join us.  HOw many children eat lunch with me?""  One little boy calls out, ""I want to eat you too.""  He then started cracking up, really hope it wasn't because of the dirty meaning :)  We took a walk around the school today becuase we were looking for living, non-living and once-living things (once-living is the oddest category ever).  My kids were so very excited.  They saw bugs and birds, it was lovely.  Of course, many were most interested in the dog poop, and dead raccoon.

A positive story:  There is this one student who had a real attitude problem in teh begining, she was a pain.  She would get out of her seat whenever she wanted, she was disrespectful and she wouldn't follow the rules.  Today she came into my classroom, and sat on the floor behind my desk.  I went over to her to see what was wrong, and to make sure she wasn't trying to steal anything (some of my stuff has walked away already).  I knelt down beside her to ask her, and she laid her head on my lap and just started crying.  My first thought, was I'm going to fall over, because I don't have the best balance in the world.  My second thought was, I'm behind my desk and my kids are crazy and I can't see them.  I was able to get her to stand up and come over with me to the door where i could talk to her, and see the class.  She said that she was going to get in trouble.  I was able to get her to reveal that in her journal for reading class she had written, ""I like to play with boys.""  Her mom had found it and I guess didn't like it, and her father was going ot have a talk with her.  She told me that she had meant to write dogs at the end of the sentence but ran out of time and her mother didn't believe her.  We talked a little, and then she sat back down.  SHe was fine after that it seemed.  Then on our walk, she just kept giving me hugs and wanted to hold my hand.  This was a child who in the beginning I must admit, I thought was going to be a pain, but I was able to see a different side of her and make a connction with her.  It felt good.  

Sigh.  Now I must go back to work when all I want to do is crawl into bed."

My principal ended up calling LaJerne (they're friends and the reason I knew about this school), and she came to visit me on Friday.  I talked with her, cried with her, and afterwards felt so much better.  She told me many times that what I'm going through, and the problems that I'm facing, are typical first year problems.  I also talked with Dr. Gould and Ann Marie.  Everyone was willing to come and visit me with my kids if I would like.  They offered their support and their suggetions and reminded me that I'm not alone in all this.  I have that saftey net of GOucher still in place.  I had been meaning to email them for the past few weekends, but I couldn't do it because I wanted to give them good news, not news that I was having trouble.  LaJerne made me realize that was a mistake.  I needed help, and they were there for me to ask.  I had a nice conversation with Dr. Gould yesterday.  After speaking with them I felt a million times better going to work today.

It also helped that I ran into Lauren at Learning How.  She too is having similar difficulties and spoke of some other people as well.  I also talked to my friend from middle school, and she said she goes home and cries everyday.  I'm not that bad.  I just wanted to say that I really appreciate all my friends who read and respond to this journal because it has helped me more than I can say.  It helps to be able to vent and to know that people care.

Today was a pretty good day at school.  My mentor teacher took over my lesson and confused the heck out of my kids, but whatever, I don't know anything :)  At least she admitted later that she was wrong.  One of my bad kids had a great afternoon.  I didn't have to talk to him once.  He fell asleep, hehe.  My mentor teacher went to wake him up, realized who was asleep and backed away.  There are still many issues that I need to work on.  Like getting my kids from my buiding to the lunch room without having to restrain a child from attacking the rest of the boys with his lunch box, but they were actually quiet for a good ten minutes when I was alone in the room, that is progress.

Now I'm just sleepy and I know there are a million things I should be doing, but I just want to crawl into bed now.  Thanks again to all my wonderful friends who read this :)"

After lunch, I was lining my kids up to go into the gym, with the gym teacher, and the principal came out and told me to meet her in her office.  THen she made me wait about five minutes as she called someone to tell them I was there, and then talked on the phone with someone else.  Then for the next 45 minutes I pretty much heard how I'm a horrible teacher because I can't keep my kids under control, and how I must get them in shape this week.  Three parents have called to complain about me.  It was not a good meeting at all.  I felt attacked during it, but whatever.  At least now I know what i'm up against.  I was told I was too nice and that I have to be meaner with them.  Then of course, I go to pick up my kids and they are all over the place, completely not listening to the gym teacher.  He tells me that he feels sorry for me having to deal with them, that they were the same way last year, and that it's not my fault.  Seems like he missed the memo from my meeting with the principal.  Pretty much everything bad these kids have done so far this year is all my fault.  Every time they hit another student is because of me.  It's all my fault.  They seem to think I can't do anything.  It was so hard not to burst into tears right then.

The worst part was, that all I wanted to do during the whole meeting was go to the bathroom.  I thought I'd have time, but I had to wait to the end of the day.  I felt like one of my kids bouncing around :)

Instead, she would just take over.  She didn't like my warm up question (which she had given me yesterday when I met with her), and she just erased it and changed it.  And my one class had already copied down the old question before we switched.  Later, she decided that it was time for the warm up to be over, so she just started asking them things.  I don't mind having her help, but I do mind her taking over and teaching probably over half the lesson.  Then she also questions my choices, my questions and my room arrangment in front of my kids, which I think undermines my authority.  I don't even know what to do about it anymore.  My parents think I should talk to her about it, but I do need her help.  Just not the kind of help that she is giving me.  ANd then I needed to talk to the principal after school, so I waited until I was done in my room and at 3:45 walked over.  She asked me to wait until 4.  So I went back to her at 4:03.  She said to give her a few more minutes.  She didn't meet with me until 4:50.  And I only needed her for about 10 minutes.

One student gave me half of her best friend necklace, so I knew I was off to a good start.  I was able to call two parents today and tell them that their child had improved on their behavior from yesterday (which isn't saying that much, but mom's deserve good news too).  The kids still won't shut up, and the principal told me today that she wants to talk to me tomorrow, but I'm not going to worry about that. I'm going to go to bed.

Quote of the day: I'm teaching about bar graphs right now.  I drew one up on the board and asked them what it was called.  A student raised their hand, and answered, ""A paragraph.""  It's so hard not to laugh sometimes.

ANother question:  If a student cries because they are being called a crybaby, what does that make them?  hehe, just kidding.

I'm in a much better mood today, hopefully tomorrow will be even better.  I do however have to go to this class from 3:30-6:15 which stinks.  But maybe I'll be able to grade some papers.

"event","Today has to have been the worst day ever.  It started off okay.  My kids went to library and I got some time in my room.  Then the psychologist came in to talk to me about two kids I had asked him about.  AFter talking he told me I had been trained well and asked where i had been trained (makes it sound like I'm a dog).  When I told him Goucher he said his daughter went there, so he seemed happy.  Then it all went downhill from there.

About halfway through my math lesson, a boy grabbed a pen/marker from this little girl.  They started fighting.  Not just hitting, but on top of each other fighting.  I had to pull them off each other.  Then when another teacher came in to help and offered to take them with her to calm down and find out what happen.  The boy freaked out, and picked up a chair and threw it.  He threw a chair!  Where was that lesson during all those classes at Goucher?  THe chair hit someone's wrist but he was okay.  Then later, there was another fight with my other group of kids.  Even later in the day the princpal called into my room and I couldn't hear her because the kids wouldn't shut up.  So that wasn't good.  I just wanted to cry as the principal told me I have to get my kids under control.  I'm trying, I really am.

My kids had gym today, and when the gym teacher saw my class he told me I got all the lucky ones.  Then after it taking us five minutes to line up to leave the gym, he told me that he needed to call some of the parents and that the kids had acted the same exact way last year, so it wasn't my fault, which helped a little.  Then he said it would have been nice if they had given them to an experienced teacher.  Sigh.  One day that will be me, if these buggers don't kill me first.  What I don't understand is how do they expect me to get these kids under control if they had the exact same issues last year?  They had the teacher that I replaced because she retired, which means that she had many, many years of expereince and yet they still misbehaved.  What chance do I have with them?

I'm just so frustrated and I don't know what else to do with them.  It's still September, I can't go on for months and months like this.  I would lose my mind.  I almost miss student teaching because at least then I had someone to help me.  The IST isn't doing that great of a job.  I told her about the chair incident and she told me to contact the kids' parents.  When I told her that I had talked to the boy's guardian before, she said, no, I had to get in touch with the parents.  COrrect me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a person usually go with a guardian if the parents are unable to care for the child? Sigh.

Back to work now.  Sorry to vent so much.  There was good stuff too, it just gets pushed away with all the bad.  Maybe tomorrow will be a post about only good things :)"

I need to create emergency sub plans which are due next Monday, but I don't know what to do with them.  ANd there is the fact that I just don't want to do them at all.  Then there are other little things I could be doing, but I keep putting them off.  I think I may have to take a break tonight so I don't lose my mind.

This past week had it's good and bad moments.  Some of my kids are insane.  But then they have a moment where they seem to not be devil children (hehe).  I've called so many parents, and I really want to be able to stop that.  The parents, however, have been really wonderful and supportive.  It really helps to know that the parents seem to think that I actually know what I'm doing :)  I'm hoping that this week will go a little smoother since I've been a real teacher for two whole weeks now.  It feels so much longer than that sometimes.  I feel almost as if I've been teaching my whole life, lol.

One cute story:  One little girl stays a little late becuase her mom picks her up late, and she was helping me to clean up my room.  SHe asked me what my name was, and I told her ""Ms.""  She said no, ""what's your human name?""  I guess that means teachers aren't human.

I hope to be able to take a nice long break this upcoming weekend.  I need to do something that has nothing to do with school.  (hint, hint)  Hehe.  Hopefully I'll be able to hang out with some people.

I hope that everyone is doing well, and if I haven't talked to you in a while, I'm sorry. School has sucked away my time :)"

"event","I surivived my first full week of teaching!!  I must admit that I am proud of myself, although I still have so much work to do.  I'm having issues with behavior managment - big surprise there.  The kids love to talk and will not shut up.  Some just ignore me when I tell them to do something.  SIgh.  It will get better.  I've already called some parents. I called a lot of them on the second day of school just to touch base and introduce myself, a lot of them were really helpful and supportive.  One mom told me I'll be a great teacher and she really appreciated my call, even though her child is an angel.  There are three boys in one of my classes that are going to drive me crazy.  One has shown me his best behavior yesterday, but then today he hit another student.  It's very frustrating.  I swear, I was never this bad a child.  Today one little girl had her highlighter in her mouth, and a little boy told me that it looked like she was smoking weed. So sad that a seven year old knows what that is.  I was told to be careful during the drug unit that we have.  I'm sure that will be interesting.  How do you teach kids three ways to say no to drugs, if their family, and maybe even their parents are doing drugs?  Just some things Goucher didn't prepare me for.

There have been a few moments where i've wondered what the hell I'm doing.  I just don't know how to handle certain situaitons. When are they jsut playing and when is an office visit necessary?  If a child says something inapporpriate how do I respond?  Why is the copy machine always broken?  And most importantly, why are there cockroches in my building?!?!\

Even though I'm complaining a little there, I do in fact love it.  The kids are really wonderful, even if some make me want to kill them.  THe other two women I'm working with worked with most of these kids last year.  I asked them for help with this one child, and they just shook their head.  It seems he was exactly the same last year.  I don't know if I can handle this behavior the entire year.  If I'm frustrated now, I don't even want to think about it.

I've been really lucky though with the parents. Most have been so supportive, and have asked me how things are going, are willing to help if I have issues with their children and offer suggestions.  I was prepared to get nothing from parents, so this is wonderful.  Although I am tired of calling the parents.

Also, everyone that I'm working with has been so helpful, and wonderful.  I'm really lucky to have found such a great support system.

THere is one thing that annoys me, and I know my Brian psych friends will understand.  The principal wants us to have our rewards posted on the wall.  I was trying not to use to many rewards, just stickers once in a while, but apprently I need more.  I made this ""Blast off to good behavior"" thing where if they are good forthe class period the rocketship moves up, if not it stays where it started.  Sadly, it hasn't moved yet.  The reason I decided on this is because the kids are the ones controling it.  I'm trying to drill that into them, lol, so unBrian of me.  They don't seem to grasp the concept of being responsible for their actions.  I'm going to keep trying.  If I need to give them rewards, than i want it to be something where the whole class will get the prize, and that they need to work together to get it. However, if I actually want anyone to get the prize, I may have to change that.  I was thinking of making a tresure chest to help out because some kids are doing such a wonderful job, I feel bad that they are being penalized because the rest of the class is insane.  Sigh.  One day I'll find a way to blend what Brian taught us with what is expected in city schools.

That's for letting me rant a little. Even with the ranting, I'm glad that I'm teaching.  I really need to do something next weekend that doesn't involve lesson plans or seven/eight year olds."

"event","So the past three days I have been at my school.  I've meet my team teacher (she has been teaching since January), and the other second grade teacher who is self-contained (meaning she teaches all subjects), and she has been teaching for 2-3 years.  They both are incredibly sweet and willing to help with anything I need.  They have also been sharing things that they were never told, but were still expected to do.

Slowly my classroom is evolving into an actual classroom.  I never knew how incedbily time consuming that was, and how every little thing needs to be done, and made, and stapled or taped or whatever.  I was in my room all day yesterday, half of today, and will have to back in on Sunday to finish up (in the morning, Michie, I can still help with the move).  I have 20 kids in my homeroom, and the other class that I will teach is at 21.

We had a presentation this morning about educating the African American Male.  The presenter kept pointing to me whenever he was talking about white people. It made me feel a little uncomfortable.  I wasn't the only white person in teh room, nor am I the only white teacher.  I guess I was in his line of sight or something.  AFter the workshop, I thinked him for the information, and he said I hoped he didn't mind that he picked on me.  I'm just glad that he said that because then I knew it wasn't just in my head.

I know michie and I had talked about this earlier in an email, but why do I get hit on my older guys?  This guy who was doing the wiring gave me his phone number and asked for mine.  Turns out he is 37, had three kids and a grandchild.  His oldest child is 18.  I told him to guess my age, and he said 25, when I told him my real age he seemed surprised.  Where are the nice young guys?  Sigh.   I guess I should just be glad that someone was hitting on me, lol.

So very tired, must crash and go to bed."

"event","I saw my classroom today!  I'm in the ""portable"" building.  I'm in room five, the first room on the right.  And the best thing is the portable building is air conditioned while the main building is not :)  I'll probably freeze but that's okay.  I got to put up the bulletin board paper and borders and now I kind of know what i want to put on them.  It's so exciting.  I got to sit at my desk.  I have a desk!!  I was so giddy throughout the day because seeing it makes it all the more real.  Which means more exciting and more terrifying.

I met the art teacher, who seems nice.  She said that I'd have a great bunch of kids since the kindergarteners were so great last year.  Problem with that is that i'm teaching second grade.  When I told her that, she just made a face and said, ""oh.""  She said that they had a lot of problems last year with the first graders because they didn't have enough teachers and had 40 students in a classroom.  There is no way that 40 studnets can fit. So I'm just hoping that the lack of consistnancy caused the problems.  Of course she then told me to be firm and mean, don't even let them cough.  Sigh, why do they keep telling me that?  Behavior management is my biggest weakness.  I hope it goes okay.

On another note, I found out that my friend from middle school is going to be teaching at Scotts Branch where i student taught.  What a small world.  She is teaching third grade, so I emailed my cooperating teacher, and she said she'd look out for my friend.  Hopefully it goes well for her.

I can't believe I'll be teaching.  The 29th is the first day of school.  Yikes."

She's six, dating shouldn't even be something she thinks about, although she did tell me that she has an ex-boyfriend, ugh, so strange.  Only four more days though - yippy!!"

There are two more weeks of camp, and I'm kind of glad about that.  A few of the kids are annoying the heck out of me, and i need to get away.  I found out that the naked boy (ask if I haven't told told you about that one before), is going to be here another week.  I really can't handle him, we were all so excited when we thought last week was his last week.  Then there is another student who has been on a behavior chart all summer, and I had to call his mom so she could know if he would get to see his grandmother or not.  She said that we've done more for him then the private school he goes too, which made me feel good.  I finished my graduate course, which means that I'll actually have some free time now.  I didn't do anything today really, other than work on a birthday present for my grandmother.  It was great."

THe judge hopes it will be done that day, but Wednesday may be needed to.  If I had been picked for the other case that a jury was picked for, it would have taken at least three weeks.  I'm going to make sure to tell that to my boss at camp so he won't be as upset, I hope.

"event","Since the last update things have been a little crazy.  Every day I've had camp from 8:30 until 4, and then Mondays and Wednesdays class, and the other days staying late at work to make some extra money.  So I've been pretty exhausted when I get home and don't really do anything, lol.  I feel kind of disconnected from everyone, and I don't really like it.  Anyway, this past Friday I didn't go to work because I had pre-employment stuff with the city.  I had to fill out all this paperwork, get physical, which consisted of a drug test and a TB test, what fun.  I also got fingerprinted and got my id badge, yet haven't signed the contract.  I think that will happen in August.  Then today I had to go to Patient first so that I could get my TB test read.  Guess what, I don't have it, hehe, no bump on my arm just a lovely bruise where she stuck me, stupid woman.  I had to wait about an hour and a half to get the reading too, what a pain.

I'm going to be missing camp again tomorrow becuase of jury duty.  I'm really hoping that they don't pick me, I don't want to do it.  I miss my kids and I don't have the energy to sit in a room and listen to people for that long, hehe.  Keeping my fingers crossed that they don't want me.

I think that's pretty much all that's going on in my life at the moment, seems pretty boring."

I can't wait to see what the kids are like, how they interact, and if I've learned anything since last summer, especially with behavior management stuff.  I'll be there today from 8-4.  Then tonight I start my first graduate class at Goucher.  I guess I just couldn't leave it yet, hehe.  The class is Mondays and Wednesdays from 7-9:15.  I have a feeling I'm going to come home and crash.  The worst part is that the text book is called child development, and I had two years of that in high school, and then one semester at Goucher freshman year.  What else can I learn?  Hopefully that means it will be simple and I won't have to stress (yeah right).  Then tomorrow, I have to be at work from 8:30-6:30 because I signed up to work the over time because I had fun last year, and more money is always good.  then Wednesday looks exactly like today.

I'll try and update this thing even if I don't sign on AIM.  I hope you guys are doing well and I hope to talk to you soon."

"event","I got back this afternoon from Ithaca (it's about a five hour drive, thankfully, my dad drove).  The weather was so horrible on the drive up, but luckily cleared up for the wedding, and it was absolutely gorgous.  Ithaca is so pretty, and the Cornell campass is giagantic.  Made me love Goucher even more, lol, and I had David boreanaz thoughts since he went to Ithaca COllege, lol.

The wedding went really well, and the bride looks incredible.  It's hard to believe that she is married.  They are going to Aruba tomorrow, and then when she gets back to MD, she has to find a teaching job, so many life changes in a really short span, I don't know how she hasn't lost her mind.  At the reception there was this really cute guy, but sadly he had just graduated high school, which made me feel old, lol.  Then the ring bearer, who was 11, never heard of the Macarana, that really, really made me feel old, as my friend and I told him, when we were around your age it was really popular, sigh.  But I'm not going to go into that rant, I'll save that for another time, hehe.  THere were three bridesmaids and one usher, the second one's car broke down and he never made it.  Luckily, there were no fights and the bridesmaids dresses weren't green and ugly (michie you better get the buffy refernce).  I can't remember if I ever showed you teh dress, so here is a link.  http://www.davidsbridal.com/bridesmaids_bycolor_detail.jsp?stid=891&sid=3183&cfid=12

"event","So a lot has happened.  I've graduated, had a party with some wonderful people, and then had two goucher friends staying here for a week, which i'm going to blame for the lack of updates.  I've been enjoying doing nothing for a while.  I have summer camp work tomorrow and then on Friday we go up to NY so i can be a bridesmaid.  I hate that so many people are getting married or engaged, it makes me feel bad that I don't have anyone.  But I'm not going to get into that.

Today was my dad's b-day party, and I realized how much some of my family members annoy me, which i knew, but I acutally had to leave the room.  My one uncle, who teases me a lot, was asking me questions about Grove Park, and then asked why I don't want to teach white kids.  I tried to answer as best I could and then walked away, he later came up to me again and started asking questions.  Then my grandmother said some really horrible things, and I just couldn't take it.  She also flipped out that I was sharing a beer with my dad, because you know it's not like I'm 21 or anything.  Although a part of me did want to drink more of it because of her reaction.  Then I found out from my other grandmother, that this grandmother (wow confusing), doesn't want me to teach at Grove Park, and had hoped that my dad would have talked me out of it.  This is the same grandmother who said I was brainwashed by my father for wanting to vote Gore (I was only 17 at the time, so i couldn't have been thinking for myself).  Ugh, it feels nice to be able to rant a little about that.

I swear, I'll start updating more. Or at least try.  Or maybe I should just try to read everyone elses, hehe.

<P><FONT size=2>This morning i went to Dondero to teach <FONT color=#33ccff><EM>swim</EM></FONT> lessons and after the first class 4 kids passed out in the locker room. Then all the instructors noticed that they too had head aches, were really <EM>dizzy</EM>, and felt like they were going to pass out. So everyone had to get out of the <FONT color=#3366ff>water</FONT>,parents came to collect their kids and started drying off. In the mean while, on the pool deck 2 instructors passed out, so we knew we all had to like, get away from the pool. So we were all in the hall, passing out, and when 6+ people have passed out and no ones being contacted for help its kinda a really serious problem.<BR>I called my dad, and he called 911. <STRONG>5 firetrucks, 4 ambulances, a swat team, and 4 cop cars later</STRONG> the&nbsp;rumor was that&nbsp;the pool was contaminated with <U>Carbon Monoxide</U> a level of 500 units (meaning deadly).<BR>All the instrucotrs were taken in ambulances to beaumont and were immediatly put on oxygen. </FONT></P>
<P><BR><FONT size=2>I felt sooooo sick, i was shaking, and my heart was racing. And my heart doesnt race. i had a pulse of 110.... which is absolutly crazy comparing to when i run, my pulse is only 76. Im not an out of shape person, my heart was like pounding and i couldnt breathe.... ahhhh</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>When your exposed to Carbon Monoxide they give you ratings 1-19 meaning you were expose, 20 being toxic = Something is wrong with you and its scarey, and 35 meaning your cashed out, dead. While i was at school i was at a 21 (the Dr. said that was my level prior to treatment)but after 2 1/2 hours on oxygen i was at a 14. which was good. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG>5</STRONG> hours later on oxygen and a I.V (which hurt like a mother my i mention) Steve visited me. That was nice. Thanks Steve. <FONT color=#ff99ff>&lt;3</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I still have the worst head ache of my life tho. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The good news is that i got 2 pairs of scrubs tho :^)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO kids, stay away from carbon monoxide, Kay?</FONT></P>

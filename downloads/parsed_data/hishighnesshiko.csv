Every day trans people are subject to violence, stigma, and individual and structural disadvantage because of their gender identity. Their lives are frequently devalued and misrepresented, and their rights overlooked and violated, even within other stigmatized and progressive communities.

On the home front, the Albertan provincial government <a href=""http://www.psac.com/news/2009/what/20090417-e.shtml"">recently delisted funding for sex-reassignment/gender-reassignment surgery</a>. I've mentioned this here before, but this surgery is NOT frivolous or unnecessary. The decision to cut it from funding was economic (dubiously so) and political. Facebook group with more info and updates <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=85048933488#"">here</a>.

UPDATE: <a href=""http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Manitoba_rejects_funding_for_trans_surgeries-6745.aspx"">Manitoba has *also* decided not to fund for GRS/SRS</a> (it never has, and just rejected a proposal to), despite having and NDP government and a relatively positive economic condition. Ontario tried to pull this shit a few years ago and got pushed back, but the fight never ends."

"event","So this is what I&#39;m thinking.

It&#39;s early May. I&#39;ve been out of school for a few weeks. Everything went fine, I&#39;m glad to be done, and maybe a little melancholy, but only in an atmospheric kind of way.

It&#39;s sunny and the humidity is up, but it&#39;s still cool out, with a fresh, wet breeze. Winter&#39;s not quite gone, and summer hasn&#39;t really arrived.

I&#39;m curled up in a high-backed armchair, surrounded by windows, a couple of them open just a bit to let that nice breeze on through. In the background Bach is playing. By Yo Yo Ma or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSqYTcfaDFc&amp;feature=related"">Vanessa Mae</a>--I can&#39;t decide which. Maybe both. With a little bit of Mae&#39;s techno remix style thrown in.

I&#39;ve got one book in my lap and two more on the floor beside me. One of these books is <a href=""http://helendewitt.com/dewitt/extract.html"">The Last Samurai</a>, my favourite book in the whole damned universe (and it has nothing to do with the Tom Cruise movie). I don&#39;t know what the second one is, but the third one is definitely something new, something I just picked up off a shelf somewhere. (The typeface on the spine caught my eye, the picture on the cover intrigued me, and the first couple of pages hooked me. Best of all, it was marked half price because only me and about three other people in the world would ever really want to read this book.)

I&#39;m not eating or drinking anything, but about an hour before I had a really lovely tea and scone at a new tea house that opened downtown. (I&#39;m meeting an old friend I haven&#39;t seen in a while next week, and I&#39;ve decided to take her there for lunch before attempting to show her the meagre sights about town.)

I feel very relaxed, but as I read my book an energy starts building up and my feet get restless. There&#39;s a character in the book that I can&#39;t get out of my head and soon I&#39;m going to have to pack up my stuff and go for a walk to try to get my thoughts in order. By evening I&#39;ll be writing a fic one-shot and rolling my eyes at my rusty prose, but enjoying myself nonetheless.

I won&#39;t be able to stay up late, though, because the very next day I&#39;ll be starting something new. My summer job, perhaps, or a new volunteer opportunity. Driving lessons possibly. Whatever it is, it&#39;s big, and it&#39;s going to be taking me to a new level, getting me up and out on my own.

But right at this moment, that I am imagining, I am comfortable in my chair, full of delicious tea, feeling the breeze from the window, reading my book in the sunlight, and contemplating this strange, exciting character who just walked into my life.

So where are you?"

PSA: <lj-cut text=""Child Abuse Masquerading as Legitimate Therapy.""><a href=""http://childtorture.wordpress.com/"">Support and advocacy website fighting back against Attachment Therapy</a>

From the site: <i>Attachment therapy (widely known as ""holding therapy,"" ""rage-reduction"" or ""dyadic developmental therapy"") is a torturous and entirely unscientific practice that preys on orphaned adoptees, foster kids and children who already have a history of abuse. 

Attachment therapy techniques rely on forceful physical coercion and restraint, non-consensual touching, verbal abuse, intimidation, enforced eye contact and punishments related to food, water and air intake. It is rejected by the mainstream psychiatric community as ""harmful pseudoscience"" and is officially banned by several states, but the practice continues to this day in the US and countries around the world.</i>

Children have died as a result of this therapy. It has no grounding in research or academic theory, and actually contradicts attachment theory, upon which it claims to be founded. I looked at the videos and read the so-called theory behind the treatment -- it's BULLSHIT. Its aim is complete compliance of children. Any act of disobedience is characterized as a flaw in the child's personality and ""attachment"", and the therapy itself relies on violence, humiliation, and coercion, not safety, trust, and respect (which is what really attachment theory would recommend). This is a perversion of child-rearing.

I don't know about the prevalence of this therapy in Canada, but it is an issue in the US. It is even covered by insurance companies there. This woman, a survivor, is trying to get word out, after finding there were no support groups or general awareness of the harmfulness of this ""therapeutic technique"".

<a href=""http://childtorture.wordpress.com/what-you-can-do-to-help/"">What you can do to help.</a>

This shit makes me mad, guys.  This goes against everything I've ever learned about effective child care and parenting, from parents, research, and personal experience.  Worst of all, it targets adopted and fostered children, some of the most vulnerable kids out there.</lj-cut>

Warning: child abuse triggers abound.  There are links on these websites that lead to graphic (verbal and pictoral) depictions of child abuse."

"event","Every time I check the news, polls are reporting something different.  This morning the Tories were in arm's reach of their majority, but now that's uncertain again.  Except all the polls are also showing a great deal of potential for change, so a Harper majority isn't off the table by any means.  This election outcome is not a foregone conclusion.  There's incredible potential for change based on every single vote that comes in.

So everyone should be voting!  If you're not sure what's what, then <a href=""http://www.elections.ca/home.asp"">Canada's election website</a> gives the skinny on the technical details of how to register and vote.  The Globe & Mail has <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080929.wplatformsfeature0929/BNStory/politics"">a Coles Notes version</a> of the various party platforms.  And <a href=""http://www.voteforenvironment.ca/"">this handy site</a> will break down for you the strategic voting options in your riding (if you plan on going ABC).

Every vote counts for something.  Even if the person you vote for doesn't win their riding, your vote still helps their popular support numbers (the thought does count!) and gains them funding.  Heck, vote for the Canada Heritage Party, if that's what twists your widget.  Spoil or refuse your ballot if you are so fed up with the whole system that you could scream.  But vote!

Voters are registering in record numbers down south, but what's going on in the US is not any more important and impactful to our lives than what's going on up here.  We may not have the excitement of Palin or Obama, but what's happening this Tuesday, especially in this climate of global turmoil, will impact how Canada develops as a country against this backdrop.  We're electing history-makers!"

"event","The fact is, living is about moving.  Some part of me believes that man invented time-keeping as a monument to this very fact.  So when I encounter a moment of the absolute sensation of life, I struggle to think of a way to memorialize it myself.

The dilemma is Heisenberg's -- to measure and record the facts of something so small as a moment is to irrevocably alter its action and essence, thereby rendering the true measure impossible.  To take a picture or write a description, however poetic or well-framed, is to necessitate the stepping out of a moment in order to observe it through a mechanical object, rather than experience it with immediacy, and to later visit its altered form in order to verify an experience one did not truly have.  Thus, human memory is not reproductive, but constructive, such that we never have the same memory twice, and even the cherished ones are new moments, experienced again for the first time, and new moments are uncapturable, like trying to draw the same cup of water twice from the same stream.

Yet these moments define us, enrich us, make us awestruck, and bring us unfathomable joy, and I wish to keep them, somehow, because the totality of the human endeavour is our struggle with the finite nature of things we wish would last forever.  I find myself at odds with these moments, these awed encounters, and I rush to open every sense, every thought, every pore, efficient as a desert plant in the midst of an unpredictable rain shower, while at the same time attempt to devise a trap, a permanent store of this love and awe and life.  Inevitably, the only sufficient homage I can invent for these moments are tears, themselves a mystery, a boon, a sacrifice, uniquely and universally human, and transient."

"event","So I'm stuffing my yaw with stuffing, mashed potato, stuffing, coleslaw, and some stuffing (and cranberry sauce!), when there's a discovery in our kitchen!

Our chicken is <i>green</i>.  The meat close to the backbone and into the breast is a bright and inexplicable olive green.  Well, there goes my drumstick.

My current theories are 1) process using industrial dye in factory (maybe for tagging/identifying produce?) has gone awry, and 2) some kind of dye in the feed resulting in overdose.

Who knows.  It doesn't look natural, either in colour or pattern.  Meat wasn't outdated and looked all right every other way.  Mother's calling public health tomorrow and then taking it back to the grocery store.

Bleh.  I wanted that drumstick.  Thank goodness for stuffing!"

"event","Oh, Globe and Mail -- you may lie and misrepresent like every other media outlet, but you occasionally have hilarious help columns.

<lj-cut text=""Bromance is my new favourite word."">One dude's problem: <i>I met this dude in school and we've been friends for 10 years. But the last time we spoke I had that feeling - a bit like the feeling you get when your significant other is about to break up with you.

I'm thinking the bromance is over.

[...]

I don't talk to my wife about this because it has a tinge of gay to it. I mean, why would one dude be all knotted about another dude not calling him back, right?</i></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The brocabulary continues."">The columnnist replies: <i>If your ""bromance"" is starting to fade, maybe you should invite him out on a ""man-date,"" and ""bropose"" to him, then the two of you can get ""manried"" and head off to a tropical ""mancation"" destination for a bromantic ""manlimoon."" [...]

Also, I guess I'm poking a bit of fun at the ""brocabulary"" of man-prefixed terms that have been in vogue lately.

But I think I've got it out of my system now.

[...] There's nothing wrong with loving your male friends. I have several male friends I'd be crushed to lose. If one of them said he was finally fed up with me and my antics, my heart would be bro-ken (okay, it's not out of my system). I'd have to walk around in the rain so no one could see I was crying, my manscara (okay, it's never going to stop) running down my cheeks. [...]

Does that make me any less mantastic? Any less heterolicious? I don't see why it should.

[...] So don't be afraid of making a ""broverture"" to your buddy. 

[...] Go for it. Run, run like the wind, like a guy at the end of a bromantic comedy - or better yet borrow a motorcycle and zoom to his house, popping wheelies, the music swelling as you ride up on the sidewalk, weaving in and out of pedestrians and knocking over fruit stands - and materialize in his doorway with a UFC DVD in one hand and a six-pack in the other and, your face working with emotion, say to him: ""Dude, it's killing me how we never hang any more.""

Hang your heart out there. Show him how you feel. You've got nothing to lose, in my opinion, but your well-founded feelings of manxiety at the prospect of losing a good, old friend.

Okay, I'm really going to stop now.</i></lj-cut>

Oh, the man-pain.

(One person in the comments found the columnist to be offensive toward gays, and to that I say TTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHPPPPPP.  Obviously making fun of heteropanic, not homofabulous.)"

<i>If I ever needed to confirm [so-and-so's] identity by asking them a personal question the answer to which only [so-and-so] would know, I would totally ask them [random trivia]!</i>

You know the scenarios I'm talking about: reincarnation, body possession, body-swapping, speaking from beyond the grave, alien impersonation, etc.

I have these thoughts all the time, but they usually slip my mind within a few hours.  I'm trying to think of them all again, for kicks.

For Bina, I would totally just say, ""Duncan?""

And for Amy, it would have to be, ""Lemons?""

I have about six thousand for Val, but I'm drawing a blank on them right now.  Ditto for Caleb.  But I've had these thoughts about all of you at some point!

So in case anyone ever impersonates you or you ever have to speak through another person's body, I am totally down with it.

That is all."

"event","My mummy got new pyjamas for Christmas, so now she looks like <a href=""http://members.tripod.com/~theseeker3/icons/bear/sfluffy2.jpg"">the blue teddy bear from Duckman</a>.  I giggled myself silly while rubbing her belly and calling her a plush toy.  That made her awfully disgruntled and she proceeded to do an interpretive Care Bear Stare.  (Meaning she doesn't know what that is, but she gave it her all.  She kind of looked like a demented ewok.)

Watching Xena again.  I'm caught between loving the all-out woman!lovefest that this show is (both for women in general and for women who love women), and feeling a little sad that Hercules and Iolaus didn't get to have near so much fun, even of the platonic hugging/snuggling/saying-""I love you""-a-bunch-of-times variety.  Then I remember Torchwood and the universe evens out.

Also, buckets of cheese.  Made of dork!  Oh, Sam Raimi -- you're so obvious in everything you do, or are even peripherally involved in, and it's usually wonderful.  <strike>Usually.</strike>

<lj-cut text=""Daily cup of rage."">I don't know what pisses me off more: the frat boys or this guy defending them with asinine semantics.  (Not that I don't love semantics, but he's, uhm, WRONG -- ""slut"" is not a completely harmless word that some crack-brained feminists have decided to interpret hysterically just 'cuz.  Frankly, the OED is off its game with this word -- I checked the definition and it is definitely missing some contemporary usage, which is decidedly more sexual and more negative.)

This guy is off his nut if he really thinks his interpretation of the event is harmless:

<i>The fact is that the young Zeta Psi pledges in question are fantasizing: I'm sure they would love to find a few promiscuously inclined babes hanging around the Women's Center, but they probably couldn't get a Yale woman to have sex with them if they got down on their knees and wept for it. So they will fantasize about meeting some of the more sexually active of the 5700 women students at Yale (many of whom will doubtless outshine them academically; it's tough life), and at night they will masturbate in their dorm rooms as normal, and by day they will sometimes find ways to be casually offensive to girls in standard college-boy manner, and the First Amendment will protect them if they announce their fantasies on Facebook.com, and the world will go on turning, and the sky will not fall, and I really don't think anyone needs to go to court about such things. Surely Yale women can find more important lawsuits to work on than this.</i>

Frankly, I don't believe that freedom of speech should act as diplomatic immunity.  People are responsible for the <i>consequences</i> of their actions.  That kind of demonstration in front of the goddamned <i>Women's Center</i> is not a healthy expression of opinion -- it's a juvenile stunt with the potential of harming young women seeking help.  The women of that campus weren't immune to the consequences of these actions, so why should the men be?  I really hope the school is taking action.

Then again, the fact that this guy is so completely off-base in his assessment of what's going on (in the article he recants as soon as he sees a picture that reveals the frat boys to be ""a dozen <i>unsavory-looking guys looking roughly like street gang members</i> blocking the door of a building in which rape counseling takes place"", emphasis mine -- apparently he assumed these Yalies were just decent chaps having a bit of fun, what ho, nevermind that they're <i>actually</i> dressed like every undergrad boy I see on campus every day) kind of makes me less mad at him.  I mean, here's a guy who's got his sexism, racism, and classism so out of step with the mainstream that it makes him look less harmless relative to the frat boys who thought this would be a good idea in the first place.  I'd be more pissed if he was a policy-maker or celebrity figure -- someone with the social capital to really influence the rest of us.

The <a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005352.html"">guest response</a> and the general discussion I've been following in various livejournals are heartening, at least.  At least this guy was challenged, even though he still doesn't seem to have gotten the point.</lj-cut>

Why, why, why did those frat boys think it would be a good idea?  Someone please explain.  Okay, the sign was dumb, whatever.  But why in front of the Women's Center?

SUPPLEMENTAL:  <a href=""http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog/2008/01/zeta_psi_pledges_love_yale_sluts_yale_womens_center_pledges_to_sue.html#comments"">And then there were the comments.</a>  These make me angriest of all.

Current winner: <i>""Tasteless? Yes. Sexual harassment? No. Legal action? LOL. Cupcakes at the Women's Center need to worry about more important things... like shaving their pits and finding a boy thirsty enough to lay with them.""</i>

ARGH.  I know it's partly the anonymity of the Interweb giving people the option to say things they might not say otherwise, but GODDAMNIT the opinions are there anyway!  And a satire defense doesn't cut it.  Satire is context, content, and intent, not just a tag you can affix to any idea you want to express with immunity from retaliation.

SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPLEMENTAL:  Unrelated, but apparently I'm allergic to studying now.  Every time in the last three weeks that I've sat down with a textbook I've started feeling seriously ill within the hour.  Now, maybe you say it's just coincidence, 'tis the season for sickery and all, but what do you say to the fact that the only reliable cure seems to be boyporn?  It's a conspiracy, says I!"

Telling students that they'll get $5000 dollars at graduation if they don't smoke through high school (based on the sponsers they find).  So many reasons why that would NEVER EVER WORK.  Actually, according to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect"">over-justification effect</a>, it might even make more kids smokers, because it conceptually increases the value of smoking (""Wow, smoking is worth $5000 dollrs!  It must be wicked cool, or they'd never pay me that much!"")."

Age 21, and I'm boy-cotting Christmas.

Not deliberately and not on my own (Mother is just as gleeful as I am at the thought of neither putting up nor taking down a single decoration and Bina is a self-described Grinch), and certainly not with any amount of venom or attempts at political commentary -- we're just skipping Christmas this year.  A little bit of Christmas music here and there, but Mother never unpacked her nativity and I've totally flubbed gift-giving (working on that still).  It just doesn't feel like Christmas this year.

*shrug*  Happy holidays to the world, though.  It's just another Tuesday for me.

"event","I could live off of clementines and sticky rice with hot sauce.  Just sayin'.

Working on updating this with my life, but I'm sort of submerged in studying and studies right now.  Will be more informative in a couple weeks?

Tragedy of the week: ordering my extra-large tea as usual and getting <i>Earl Grey</i> (drinkable, but definitely not my favourite and definitely a disappointing substitute for orange pekoe).  And then going back to buy a replacement, and nearly getting served DECAF.  This after eight straight hours on campus (after an ELEVEN hour stint the day before).  Same lady both times.  She didn't clue in to my despair.  I think she thought I was being cute.

So.  Much.  School.  It's kinda fun, but, you know, lots.  Wow.

(I have eaten upwards of seven clementines today alone.  I am so not going to get scurvy.)

SUPPLEMENTAL:  So, the <a href=""http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007/nov/071123a.html"">Unborn Victims of Crime Bill</a>.  Interesting.

<lj-cut text=""My thoughts."">I have to admit, one element of this proposed legislation concerns me.  First of all, it is intended to apply to anyone (in the commission of a crime against the mother or child, who knows or ought to know the woman is pregnant) who harms an unborn foetus at <i>any stage of development</i>.

To be clear, this legislation does not attempt to address the maternal neglect or abuse, nor legal termination or acts of good faith.  It does, however, have an exlusionary clause for the defence that the foetus is not a person.  And we are talking murder-equivalent consequences here: it calls for no less than ten years and a maximum of life in the most general of circumstances.

Now, I don't mean that I think this bill is totally wrong (I really don't), but the schism of concepts between this bill and our abortion legislation gives me pause.  There does not seem to be a comfortable fit--is legal abortion operating through just a loophole?  It seems like it!  I think we need to go back and really address section 7 of the Charter (right to life) and the status of a foetus before we continue on with this kind of law-making, or we could end up with a hell of a mess on our hands and in our courts.  I've gone over all three bits of legislation, and they are damn sparse.  Maybe the case law would be more enlightening...  

*sigh*  Maybe the loophole approach is best.  I'm never sure exactly where I stand on abortion and how I want it to be defined.  I don't believe I would abort a child I was carrying, even if I wasn't yet physiologically aware of it--hell, I get attached to miniature <i>kitchen appliances</i>, never mind a tiny blob of cells with the potential to become a human being!  So obviously I, personally, think of the things as ""people"" pretty early on.

However, I support legalized abortion and I don't believe women should be required to have children (nor are they murderers for terminating), especially not with the incredible stigma and social pressure of being a young, single mother.  Or even young and pregnant!  I think anti-abortion legislation should come with reasonable and highly effective measures to support and protect the women affected by it (unlikely!).</lj-cut>

Man, I also keep coming back to my theme of ""what makes a person?"".  More on that in a later post.  A multitude of converging thoughts, avalanche of cognition."

For my part, I've had a few over the years, but none quite so strongly as SG-1 and SGA.  Possibly because of the real-time and plausibility factor that have deliberately been worked into the series.  I really just want people to be that brilliant and cranky.

And Jessica has been teasing me about my sneeze lately.. x.X; I've been sneezing alot, and it's all.., ""AAHHHCHIII!!"" o_o; I stayed the night over her house last night. o_o; And.. I had to do the paper route, so I've been up since 11:00AM yesterday morning. -Yawn- =] And I'm bored, and lazy, and lonely, and want to watch this movie, so I'ma go.. -Burps-

"event","Y'know, I looked back on some of my old entries, and it sickens me... how pathetic I am, how I basically beg for attention. I am an attention whore, as much as I hate to admitt it.. It's time Lisa grew up, and stopped playing games. ""Oh my god, I'm so depressed, give me attention."" I am depressed, constantly, but it gives me no right to ask for attention. It really does make me sick.. Feh.

I guess I'll just write out some things.. -Shrugs- Don't know what it will be yet, I'm just typing this up from my mind, as I go along.

Yesterday I ran away from home again, and showed up at Jessica's door crying.. She let me in, and I told her what had happened.. ( I don't want to talk about it here. ) She just stared for a moment, not saying anything, then hugged me, I didn't do anything, I just stood there, and kept crying. It felt good.. to know that I had a shoulder to cry on, to know that someone would always be there for me, if I couldn't manage to get on here to talk to someone. It just felt so good... it wasen't an e-hold, or an e-hug, but a real one, and it made me feel better. It was a half day, so I sat on her couch, and cried the rest of my tears, we waited until the kids got home from school, and then took them to the park. I got to swing, which made me very happy. I love swinging, in fact. My birthday is Saturday, people asked me what I wanted for my birthday, and I told them, just to be able to swing, perferably at night. And Jessica said she would make that happen for me.

I guess this birthday won't be as bad as last, though last year, my mother and sister had a reasonable explination for missing it. So I forgive them. ^-^; All turned out well in the end... kinda. A heh, good news for Lisa, for once. I might be leaving soon, as in, leaving here. My mom said I might not be able to come down until August, but Liz, and her mother, both agreed that I could come down there, when school ended, for as long as it took, which be until like August, and i hope I stay until after the 13th, for that is Liz's birthday. And I want to be there for her... her Onee-Chan... -Hugs her-

Thursday is Tim's birthday, I have a gift, and plan on going to the grave to give it to him. ^^;... Yeah he did it, but you know what? I'm fine with it, if he got happiness, than I'm happy too. Just know Tim, I love you, forever.. ^^; Even though you can't read this, I just wanted to tell you, you'll always be in my heart. And I know, they say people forget, but I won't.. 

Hmm, what else. Oh yes.. I've been a bit apathetic lately, emotions almost totally gone, not quite but almost. But this morning, I woke up, feeling.. oddly happy.. not true happiness, but.. just a hint of it, so I've been smiling today. It wore off, not to long ago, and I'll chuckle, or smirk every now and then at someone's comments, but.. I guess it faded.. as quickly as it came.

I've also been getting migranes again, I got more medicine for it... but they don't help, they just make me.. overly-hyper. Which isn't always good, considering I'm a bit dangerous to be around when hyper.

It will soon be eight months for Ryan and I.. eight months, yey... oh heh, was at dinner. I just scared the shit out of Chris...see, shorty has a heart murmur, and was saying he had chest pains, and I just about choked on my Hawaiin Punch, and stared at him. I told him he had to tell people about that, no matter how little the pain was, that at any given moment, his heart could explode.. and it's true. I didn't want to scare him, even my dad agree'd.. last year, when I was still in NY, apparently he had gotte out of school early, because he was crying over chest pains. He was showing signs of having a heart attack, and yeah. o.O I told him to tell someone right away, when ever he felt that.. and if anyone ever refused to let him talk to my dad, they would have to deal with me, and my switchblade, fists, and bat. <.<; Yeah, I love him, STFU. ><;;

I believe I'm going to go now, I ate a bit to much, I'm beginning to get a migrane, and erm, I wanna talk to C-Sama and Ryan, so.. ciao I guess...

I don't really have much to talk about. My dad's birthday was on the fourth.. uhm, yesterday was my seventh month aniversary with Ryan...and my birthday is really close. The 23rd, I shall be fourteen. And I am really dreading that day.. why? The fear of spending it alone again.. just.. for the past two year, my birthday has sucked.. Well, actually three years. But okay, so.. since I was ten, I've had bad birthdays, and this year, I just want to go to a park and swing on the swings all day. I don't know why, I just feel.. maybe if I spent this one alone, next years would be better. Because I know this one will be bad too, just a gut feeling I guess.... but, onto the next subject...

In school today, dear god. Last hour I was going crazy... I couldn't stop laughing, and saying obscene things.. like.. about ... crabs.. <__<;; I felt high, and I don't know why I would. And it onyl started to happen around that time.. I mean, my whole body was numb, I was laughing, saying stupid things, not focused on my work... was about to get in trouble. I guess that's what happens when you stop taking you're medicine? Was I like this before I started taking them? I can't remember, but I didn't like the feeling I was getting. And I still kinda feel high. x.x; This is not good... I'ma tell my shrink about it, and maybe she'll be able to help... or something.

May is nearing pretty quickly. I SHOULD be going home... but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe June, becuase school will end at the end of May.. Eh. I don't want to wait that long, I hate this.. city/town what ever, I hate the people in it, and the culture that surrounds me. I guess those are my reasons for wanting to go home, that and I miss my mom and big sister... alot. I think about them all the time, and my big German Shepard, Hobo. ^_^ Misssss himmmmm.........

OH! I'm thinking about taking piano lessons.. I want to learn how to play it.. I can play.. two things.. literally. xD; Mary had a little lamb, and something Phil (From Wake) taught me. Something with the F sharp keys.. something like that. I used to play the flute, and I want to play drums.. I own some drumsticks, but that's about it. And I WANNA PLAY THE FRIGGEN PIANO! >_< LEAVE ME ALONE!! RAWR! 

And now I'ma go down to Jessica's, cool off, and talk.. =\...

Back, and talking to Ashley, and no, not my sister. The one that moved to North Carolina. When I get back to NY, she's gonna kidnap me for weeks. ee; We already have it planned, of course, the whole decison is up to my mom, but I'm sure she won't mind at all. oo; Then again, maybe.. I 'unno.. >.< I'll figure it out when I get home. o_o; But for now-- FUCKING CHAIN LETTERS! -Beats person who sent her one- <-< Oh uhm... Yeah.. but for now.. I'm go, and talk to Ashley s'more, so.. ciao.

o.O.. Wtf? Your Brain is 40.00% Female, 60.00% Male 

You have a total boy brain
Logical and detailed, you tend to look at the facts
And while your emotions do sway you sometimes...
You never like to get feelings too involved 

XD Dood. -Sneezes.- I must go, this is third hour if you must know. We're on half day schedule, because we have a student vs. staff dodge ball game soon. <_<; So, ciao.... Nnn.. .<<; I'm being watched,so I'll go.. 

Lisa <3

You belong in the land of darkness, otherwise known as one of the worlds in which I dwell. All here is beauty inspired by tragedy and great sorrow. Write or go through other creative outlets to express the anguish you may be feeling, and never let anyone tell you that you are just being 'weepy' or full of 'teenage angst'(if you're a teenager.If not, then they really should be punished for calling you one. They probably are trying to insult your maturity...fools.)and always remain yourself, dark and amazing. Never change.
 
 You are the sad teen. Everything in life is fucking miserable. You constantly look over your shoulder and wonder who is judging you...even when you are alone. So naturally, you have become a little paranoid and pessimistic. Your personality can be one dimensional but confusing. You are constantly bored with life and wish that something could spice it up. You have a unique view on life and have identified the problems with school society (Ex...what makes popular people, how the student mind works...) You would rather be alone because you hate being hurt. You tend to think that no one understands you, not even your parents / guardians / friends. But that is just the opposite! The people who love you want to help, but they don't know how because they have a feeling that they will say something wrong and turn you away. You have to let them know that you are willing to hear what they have to say...and it might do some good to listen to them. 
 
You're a very depressed, lonely person. Something happened to you that changed your point of view on life or maybe you always been this way. You don't have any friends because you don't see the point in making them they will just leave anyway so why bother or maybe you just don't want them. But try and stay positive there are people who love you, so don't push them away they just want to help. You might be scared to make friends because you think they might hurt you, but they won't, good friends always stay together so try and make some. 
 
You're Element is Night. You're a bit of a loner, a loner who is very creative but never shows their work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriguing and unorthodox, but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like Diamonds in the Rough. 

And then after I got out of fifth hour, I wrote some things down on some paper.. and typed them, so here...

I am here to survive, to live day to day. I create pain to release pain and live in a tormented world of my own making, though I never wished it upon myself. One day, it will all end, and I can at last relinquish the pain and the hiding and all of the sorrow. But I try to go on, and so far, that seems to be the meaning in my life. To continue until I can no longer. 
 
Until next time, 
Lisa"

"event","I am typing this at... 5:43 AM, I couldn't sleep last night, so I got up,a nd watched about four movies. Scool of Rock, 100 Women, Ju-On, and Ghoulies... ._. -Sighs some.- I feel sick, and I cannot stop shaking, if I puke when people are up this morning, I probably won't be going to school.. Yeah, I don't sleep much, I know, and it makes me sick.. literally. It's probably why I get migranes. And probably why I get so irritable... <-<;; Ahem yeah...

Ryan started an account on Live Journal. ^_^ -Clings to him.- Teehee... You better post.. <_< Or I'll bite y-- <_< No, you might enjoy that, I'll...-Rubs temples.- Headache.. anyway.. I'll kick yer ass. =]

Yes, I'm going to go take a shower, and hopefully not puke up what's in my stomach, which I think I'm gonna do here soon, considering I can taste dinner, which was at 6 something yesterday evening... Arg... I need my sleeping pills, why did my doctor have to cancel them? Narrrr.. @_@ C-Sama.. help me.. -Collapses on her.- I feel weak, not tired, but weak... And I feel sick, and I'm ranting.. I know it..

Ooo.. -Shiver.- Cold chills, I wonder where those came from, and I have to sneeze? ... -AACHI!- x_X;; Brb, Lisa needs cereal, and lets ALL hope I don't puke it up, kay? Okay, I changed my mind on the cereal, it is now ten until six in the morning.. Lisa what the hell are writing a journal entry at this time of day for? ... I'm bored, feel sick, and need something to do?

Hn, what's happened to me in the past couple of days.. <_< Went to Wake, as usual... got pictures taken, got my own page on one of the Wake the Dead gallaries.. I went looking for the link, I can't find it at the moment, so I'll give you people this one instead. http://leoktopous.net/wakethedead/index.html I'm on a page called.. Lisa's page. =/ Uhm what else did I do? ... I can't honestly remember right now, my brain is like.. BLAHHH.. LISA GIVE ME SLEEP, OR I'LL MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO THINK AND FUNCTION TODAY IN SCHOOL.. and I'm all... Blahhhh -Drools on self.- >__>;;; ... And then my brain.. LISA, I NEED SLEEP, GIVE IT TO ME NOW... -MAKES HER DROOL MORE- Lisa: =]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -DROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.- Nani? ^_____^;;; -Smiles foolishly.- Brain: I give up on you woman... Lisa: -Drooool.- xDDD;;; 

I need help, yes I do. And I also need a garbage can, excuse me while I lean my head over and wait for puke... Or not.. >_> I swore I would have puked then.. -Shrugs some and glances down at the plushies in her lap.- XD You know what's fucking... weird for me? I was watching Ju-On, alone.. in the dark... in a basement.. <__< And.. I got scared at one point in the movie, and was all, ""OH MY GOD NO!!'' -Closes her eyes, hides under blanket, clings to plushies for dear fucking life.- <_____< Then I would peek just one eye out from under the blanket at some points. XD I'm so babyish.. I hate that sound. ;-; ... Ehhhahhhhaehhhehehehehehhhh.. that one... -Burps.- Ew, tasted like.. like... A burp. <_<; 

It's 6:02, and I'm so fucking clueless. -Drools.- ^_^ I have no idea what I'm gonna wear.. -Drooool, drool.- So excuse me whilst I rummage through my.... While I go through my clothes? -Couldn't word it right the first time.- <__<;;; For the nosey people: My ""Leave Me Alone!"" Shirt, blue jeans with Anarchy symbol on my high, studded belt, and black zip up hoodie, and black converse of course... Hey, where did I put my glasses. oo;;

Okay, I found them.. oo; -Clings to her Ryan, who is probably on his way to school at the moment.- >_>! ZOMG.. I talked to Tony last night. =] I've missed the little fucker... -Goes all Tony like, does the heel toe.- Wurd, dawg. oo;;; Nah, he doesn't talk like that, but he is a wigger, he admits to it. XD C-Sama's brother calls him... SexyWigger or something like that.. <_< I dun know. 

Yah, I'm gonna go now, take a shower and such, I smell like cigarettes. -_-; Damn it dad... Oh, no, I'ma change my shirt.. maybe... grey dress shirt with my tie, I dunno, depends on how I feel when I get out of the shower, so.. g'bye! o.o;;

Then during lunch, Allen pulled me to his locker. -Ran up some flights of stairs first.- x_X And he opened it, and pulled out a teddy bear that sings. ^__^ I was so happy, I even hugged him.

Then I lookd on our cutting board, and saw my name on a paper thing. It was from a florist. I first thought, Tim! Because I told him I had never received flowers before, and he was all grinny and stuff after that. We got to the florst at four Chris was all, it's from Ryan. I said nothing, smiling the whole ten minutes there, we got there. >_> I went in, took them a couple minutes to find it, then they got it out. A beautiful white basket with three white roses, a bunch of red carnations, a single white and pink lilly, and some purple flowers i don't know the name of. I blinked and awe'd then pulled the card out. ^__^ IT WAS FROM RYAN! Lisa: OMIGOD! O_O -Reads, squees and melts.- XD I won't say what it says.. >_> ...

"event","Okay, I'm going to type out this dream before I forget. 

I have no idea where this dream took place, so yeah. All I remember, is me being asleep, and Ryan coming over. O.O;; He came over when I was asleep, and he wrapped his arms around me in the middle of the inght, and I woke up, and found him sleeping next to me. Then it blanked out, then I was looking through the closet at Ryan's shirts. XD; Then uh, it went to something about Japanese soda, and how it has the marble in it and all that. o.O; Then it went to Ryan leaving. ._.; I dun remember that, then uh, Lisa running around, with a bunch of soda. o.o; Then some computer--OH!! I was whining because Ashley was playing Sims on teh computer, and >_> she took off some kind of hat I had on and threw it, and I kept whining to my mom about it. Yeah.. -Strains her mind more.- There was some guy in there too, I don't know who he was... And then I woke up. o.o;; Odd isn't it?

But anyway, Lisa went to Wake last night, Joe was there, and his friend Deke, who I met earlier like in May, and his cousin Ted. They were putting on a skit,and if Mike didn't show up I was going to be the small demon. Mike showed up, Lisa pouted, then Josh (Small demon) had to leave, to where, I dun know. So I got to play the part of the small demon. n.n; Then I was collared. o_O;; I kept saying, 'pet the kitty' in Japanese, and forced Deke to pet me. XD I got his collar too. Though he got it back. Then, Leesa and Tiavi's band played, and I.. as usual waved the 'revolt' flag around whilst they did. -Rubs her arms.- x-X! Then after that... Oh yeah, earlier I ran home and got my plushies. >__>! But yeah, I walked over to a canvas thing, painted my hand black, then smeared it down.. o.o; It looked hawt y0. Oh m' god. @_@;; Dopey was calling me sexy, Deke was calling me kawaii, Joe was calling me cute, and Ted (Deke's cousin) was calling me a mix of kawaii and cute. x___x Lisa wanted to eat them all! Yeah, later on that night, I stopped talking Japanese and confusing people. And just settled down. o.O; Which means I calmed down damnit. I went over and painted some Kanji on the canvas, then an all black kitteh wif red eyes. n.n; After that I sat down and such, and just listened to the bands... I kinda had a headache. =/ Then everyone left, my friends anyway, including Joe. All that was left was Ted, and Deke, Deke no where to be found. >.>; Ted and I sat and watched the people pray. o_o And rock side to side. One guy started to speak in tongues... I will tell you what, that shit sounded like Aramaic! o_o A dead language y0. ... And so I hid my head in Ted's coat, becuase that crap was scaring me. x_X! So then, we just silently got up, and creeped out the door. >D; He gave me a ride home, I gave him my number, he gave me his SN's and such. XD Today we're supposed to go rampaging the mall. XD.. Wee... o_o Yeah, I told them they could come kidnap me anytime, because I don't like being here. >.>; They said, 'okay'. Yeah, so all in all.. I had a good night. ^_^; And now, I am going to go, and take a shower and such.. <.<;; I got some paint on my hands still...and yeah... Ciao..

Lisa just zones out at times, and really doesn't notice of anyone is there. This is going to be a rant, yeah. <_<.. So deal with it. -Burps.- ONTO THE RANTING. I got some of my current grades in school. Science is now a C.. =/ Math is a B, the rest are A's. >.>; Grades are dropping like mad y0. Now, onto the more... pushing subject on my mind.

People are pushing me to RP again. I see no need to RP anymore, when I first began, it was just a way to get away from my life. It was another reality that I could turn to when I needed to get away. It worked wonders indeed, but then I started to get to emotionally involved, I'd mix fantasy with reality, and cry over character's loses, or even breakups. It was a part of me, and when a tragady happened in RP, it took it's toll on me. So, I started to turn to other things, like OOC'ing, that...got old and annoying, so I just RP'ed.. every now and then, a trip to the chibi center, one lining, which by the way, made me feel degraded, because I was so used to multiple paragraphs that it was hard to think of putting all that detail into one or two sentences, but I got over it. Then it got to the point where I only RP'ed with certain people. Not it's I only RP with one person, and that one person has to force me into it, or trick me into it. I see RP as another world in itself, which it is, duh Lisa. But, what I'm getting at is... why should one RP, when it's a reality that you can never truly have, because it's not real you can never have that happiness.. in reality. If one can't truly grasp the happiness that they feel when they RP, why do it? Or the sadness they feel, sorrow, loss, etc. This is what has been pushing at my mind for some time now. And it's also why I choose no to RP anymore.

Ahem, now that I have that out, what else can I rant on. Hn. Yes, Valentines Day is just around the corner, and I let it slip my mind. Damn.. I have an approximate of five cards to get and send out, or give. I know the cards for everyone, because I went looking before hand. I'd like to get everyone teddy bears or the likes to, but my dad is not willing to give me that much money to send things out. Eh. -Shrugs.- Valentines Day has always been lonely for me, for I've spent it alone, for almost thirteen years. Now that I have someone though.. I hop it will be different, though I can't literally hug and kiss him, and tell him 'Happy Valentines Day' I hope he'll be okay with a card and an e-kiss from me. n.n;; Heh.

What else can I rant about, hn, since I have nothing better to do then stare at the screen and wait for replys from Ryan. -Rests her cheek in her hand.- Meh, I want to cut my hair, but I know a large ammount of people who would chase after me with pitchforks and torches if I did, screaming, 'Kill kill kill!' o_o; It's my hair damnit. At the same time though, I'd like to let it grow out. It's a confusing subject. Should I let it grow out so I can be happy wif my hair again, or should I cut it and spike it like I was able to do a while ago? I 'unno exactly what I'm going to do with it yet, but I'm sure my decision will be a good one, not that they are to begin with anyway. =/

OH!! My birthday is also coming up, I'm going to try and talk my relatives into buying me a trench coat. I doubt that they'll get me one, but I can try. I've wanted one for a while now. A long black one, that doesn't exactly sweep on the ground, but doesn't exactly go above my ankles. Long black leather one. Or a black jean one. Either way it's fine with me, I'd wear it every single day. For I have a low body temperature to begin with and I'm always cold, so yeah. >_> God, what else can I rant on, because I'm beginning to grow boreddd......

Meh, I have nothing else to rant on, so I'll leave with a thinger I wrote, and maybe a quote... 

""Even blood that pours down from the slash wound to the chest need a reason, right? Don't humans feel at ease by hurting other people? Why do you look so disgusted? Deep inside, you deceive yourself with things you don't know, right? Will we never understand eachother? Is it you not wanting to? This is the garden of suicide. Are you having fun? Will my dreams come true at that garden? You don't have a reason to live in front of you?.............In front of you is a box garden full of all you people's lies and deciets.""

"" Even loved ones scatter like petals from flowers in my hand... So even if I engraved the meaning that I live in my hand, it would only be known as flowers of vanity.. Let's bloom flowers of attempted suicide.. Goodbye. Kiss me. This is just my memory. ""

Both written by me, but both different meanings.. Now... -Skits.-

"event","Again, Lisa is typing this in wordpad, why? -Shrugs.- No reason... So..here goes my day..

I woke up at six Am.. went back to bed until seven, saw the clock, said fuck, got up, showered for like ten minutes, got dressed and such, ran out the door just in time. I got on the bus, it's okay, I blast Atreyu all the way there until my ears ring. I got to school, in homebase, said one word all the time in there.. I only said.. ""Mmph"" And I don't really think that's a word, more like a sound. Then in Glee club I just lipped all the songs, Social studies, my shoulder started bleeding again. ""Lisa... what the hell did you do?!"" -Watches the blood run down her arm.- Lisa: -Blink blink.- ""What Sensai-- .... I'm bleeding....''  -Gets sent to the nurse.- My nurse was all..""How did this happen?"" .. O_O Lisa: I FELL ON GLASS!! Wrestling...... -He puts a bandage on it, her shirt all down past her shoulder and shit.- xX.. OW! BE CAREFUL!.. I dun think he bought it. Seriously, he just kinda eyed me... and I just coughed and took the bandags her gave me and stuck in my shoulder, he was prodding it too..... that...fucking hurt. Then Science.. uh, I was behind on all the work, so I was constantly writing all hour, never once stopped. Math, just kinda...did my work, said nothing, lunch, didn't eat, took a drink of Juanita's drink.. uh... Fifth hour computers, just typed my little heart out.. Sixth hour language.. >_> Oh god...... I was writing an essay right, and I always have one of Ryan's pictures on me.. one on my bedside table, one in my planner. Allen looked over at the picture of my mom I carry, and he's all, ""That's not you're mom.."" Lisa: -Stops and blinks.- ....  Allen: She's to pretty to be you're mom.. Lisa: -All anime falling over.- xD!!!!! Are you calling me ugly?! Allen: -Turns away and smirks.- Fucking whore, that's my mom.. and that's my big sister.. -Points.- Him: >_> -Points at Ryan's picture.- Is that you're brother? Lisa: YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS! YER MY BEST FRIEND YER SUPPOSED TO KNOW!!! Allen: XD IT LOOKS LIKE YER BROTHER! Me: MY BROTHER IS ELEVEN!!! HE'LL BE SIXTEEN SOON! DORKK!!!! -Whacks.- Allen: -Cracks up.- Sensai: >_> Stop flirting you two.. -Lisa and Allen freeze, glance at eachother cough then get back to work.- ... We then had to judge eachothers essay's we wrote on ourselves, of course Allen and I judged eachothers, he wrote on mine.. , ""No, I thought the essay was written well, but she needs to stop putting herself down."" -Lisa get's her paper back, stares, whacks him over the hed with her pencil.- e_e Dork. Last hour health, Lisa just layed on her chair and zoneddd... came home, didn't feel good, layed on my bed, puked, slept until seven. o-O Got on the computer, and now here I am. So bye..

"event","Again, typing this in Wordpad for some unknown reason...

I got talking to Jeff for a long while last night. He got me thinking on the past, and I know, I'm a fool for doing it. I looked back on old memories with him, we had our laughs, smiles, giggles, cries, hugs, etc. It all ended with him telling me to get some sleep, and a hug, and a gentle kiss on my forehead, then a nudge to bed. Then today, I woke up, and I didn't even want to get out of bed. I felt lonely, forgotten, invisble, as if I'm not real. Today in school, I didn't even bother getting dressed, I stayed in my PJ's. All day, my hair stayed in my face, I didn't smile, talk, or laugh. When someone talked to me, I stared at them... At lunch, I sat alone and poked at the fries.. then Sensai came over and told me my grade in math was a C.... At the beginning of the quarter, I had an A. That just somehow made me feel worse, I didn't do any of my work today, I sat and drew, damn near came close to tears. When I was walking home, I had Iris playing on my headphones, I glanced at my neighbors puppy, and he just kinda walked away from me. I don't feel real today, as if people jsut stare right through me. They would walk past me, and bump into me, not even glance at me, talk to me, nothing. I feel forgotten, and lost. As if I'm not even here for anything. I know, I know, ""Everyone is here for a purpose Lisa."" Go shove that up you're ass. Once you know how I'm feeling right at this moment of time, you'd want the same thing I do. Just to curl up into my bed and go into an eternal slumber, to never wake up. Be lost in a dream, it's better then reality. In my opinion anyway. I just want to be noticed, and cared for.. and I'm not talking people on the net, because I know some of them care. But here, I wanna be held when I need it, and to have a shoulder to cry on, to turn to that person with -ANYTHING- if I needed it, to love them, to be loved in return, to spend time with them. 

I'm tired of putting up a faccade, so everyone thinks I'm fucking happy, so everyone doesn't worry about me. I love my family and friends. They're what keep me alive, and each day, I lose a piece of myself to what everyone calls, reality. I don't think there is such a thing as reality. I don't think there's such a thing as normal either. No one is truly 'normal'. Normal is, I think, a state of mind, where someone thinks, if someone dresses differently, talks differently, and looks different from everyone else in that community, there automaticlly not 'normal'. I'm tired of being asked everyday if I worship satan. How can one worship something they don't even believe in? 

Lately, I've come to conclude that everyone is an outcast, everyone has their differences, they are just afaird  to put them out in the open, so everyone can see that in some aspects, they're not 'normal'. They're scared of what the reactions of others may be. That if they show who they truly are, no one will like them anymore. 

As a young girl, I was told many things, and showed many things no child should ever see... Or hear.. Things happened to me, that no child should ever feel, or even fear. Maybe that's why I'm so messed up... I don't know anymore, now if you excuse me, I'm going to go contemplate things... Such as why I was put on this earth..

Until next time... Lisa"

"event","Yeah, since Lisa couldn't handle being here and all, I left with Tim. We argued about where to go for like, two hours I swear to god.. Then he got a phone call from Jeff, we went on our way to get him, and he kept poking me as I stared out the window with the hood of my hoodie up, and I was all, ""Neh, stop poking me you freak."" -Idly squeaking.- Tim: ""No... you need to get happy."" Lisa: ""Fuck off...baka."" -Bites his finger.- Tim: o_o! -Wiggles it around in her mouth.- Lisa: e_e.. -Pushes it out with her tongue.- ""I said stop fucking poking me.."" Tim: ""You know when you bite me it only turns me on, and when you use you're tongue it only turns me on more."" Lisa: -Stares out the window more.- ""I don't really care.."" -Stares out the window more.- ""And I don't see why, no one would want to date me anyway.."" Tim: ... ""Uh, I've had  a crush on you since i met you.."" Lisa: -Glances at him, blank stare.- ""Why the fuck....would....""... Tim: ... ""...."" Lisa: .."" .."" -Stares all blank like.- Tim: ''Aren't you gonna say something?"" Lisa: ""....I see..."" -Goes back to staring out her window.- Then later on, we picked up Brent and Will instead of Jeff, who happened to be sick. I kinda snapped on Brent and Will.. Lisa: -Twitches.- ""Will you two shut the fuck up, you're immature and annoying, Will you're a gornw man and act my age, Brent you're almost seventeen and act my age, and I the most mature in the fucking car?"" Brent and Will: .. o.o.. ""What crawled up you're ass and died?"" Lisa: ""You two.."" God, then we sat in Will's driveway for fucking two hours, and finally I said, ""Fuck it, take me the fuck home before I strangle these two.""

He took me home, end of story. I come back to find my Ryan pissed, and dun know what's wrong. Now I must go, before someone else fucking pisses me off for no reason. -_-

Currently there is a man outside my basement window putting borders around it, I fink he may be staring at the Lisa sitting here at the desk and siging her little heart out. o_O; Speaking of singing, I signed up for this solo at school, I'm singing a song call, ""The Language of Love"" xD;; Hey, I didn't pick it...

Okay, not alot has been happening lately. I've been giving the cold shoulder to some people.. Some people say I'm being to 'mature' >_> Okay, the other night I was bouncing on and Off of Ryan's head all chibi like.. tell me...is -that- being mature? I think not. Mmph, also last night I was in a coference with Gene (Ash's boyfriend), Ash (Big sister) and Ryan. o_o Okay, Lisa was bouncing off all of them, and shooting them with her E-shotgun. =O.. Oh yes, I was all.. ""To know me is to love me.....or I shot you in the face."" n.n

C-Sama is currently reading through all my 'important' journal entries. XD She said the ones that make her go ;-;. >_> Lisa is almost always depressed, but you know what. n.n The moods come at random, sho kish my ass. I could go all homocidal like on ya'll if I wanted to. >_> yea, I said ya'll. Nanananana. >.O!.... I have a headache, like seriously. I had a migrane the other night, and puked my fucking brains out. o_o Then I sat and watched all the anime-ness on TV... then after I took my pills, got online to talk to Ryan... XD.... I was all 'n.n' Every sentence.. Him: o_o I haven't seen you this happy since....I asked you out I think.. It's not natural.

Dunanananan o_o;;; FLASHBACK ON THE FIRST TIME ON THE PHONE WIF C-SAMA!! 

I had the funnest time last night. ^_^ I mean C-Sama couldn't even get me to smile when she was vewing the cam, but when I got on the phone with her, Oh. my. God. XD I was laughing so fucking hard my sides began to hurt...You have the cutest fucking voice as well...

When she first called I was..EEK OMG..I'm so nervous.. Then I picked up the phone and she was like, ""Hello."" I said Hi..She told me not to be shy. XD And I was knowing me. Until she stared to yell Wenis. XD It was so funny. I kept saying Wenis to everyone. XD! Today at school. o.o! I'ma yell it as loud as I can in the gym...

Oh, I didn't think I would meet anyone like me. ^^ And yes, C-Sama and I are so much alike. o.o;! I wanna move to where she is and kidnap her, then take her here. SHE SHALL BE MY PLUSHIE DAMNIT! O.O MINE! >_>....

She has the cutest fucking voice. x_x The whoile time in my mind I was going. ""SQUEE I WANNA STEAL HER!"" XD.... God, C-Sama...You made me laugh so hard, I thought I was gonna piss my pants. XD!!!

O.O! We got into the subject about how guys boxers are so far up their ass it makes their butt cheeks look all firm and shit XD It was so funny...

Thank you C-Sama, thanks to you I am now happy. ^^ You have made me laugh more then I ever have...God, I can't wait until you call today. I'ma be hugging the fucking phone waiting for you to call XD...Feh o.o!!..I luff you!! AND MISS YOU ALREADY!.. -Weep, cry.- >_> -Drags the already sleeping and clinging Ryan to the C-Sama's bed then crawls in as wel, squirms in the middle and cuddles both of them.- ^^

XD... Fweee. >_> Then I read the entry in the first of September. xX I think that wzs like the second day of school for me, I was so depressed, I dun reall yknow why. Probably because I felt soo....alone? ..>_>;; That was before I was REALLY close with Liz, Tony, and Gren. o_o; Yes, Lisa is like.. not so depressed anymore thanks to them. Though I do get into these states where it's like... I 'unno. 

Today in first hour gless club, I kept saying orgasam.. XD... It was funny, then in health, Bryan-San asked me to write a two sentence thingy on myself.. >_> Wrote: ""Ahem, I am Ryan's rift of impending chaotic cuddlyness and ectasy, I am so pwned."" XD he's all.. ""Lisa, that's not quite what I meant, but excellent use of words."" Lisa: ^_^ -Gloats.- 

>_> yeah... I told him this once too, ""I live a life so sedentary as to render the concept of time meaningless."" He just fucking stared at me. o.o;; .... Then we were on the subject of loyalty today and I was all, ""Loyalty is not blind, and it's not forced. Rather, it is a sincere bond of obligation, pledged out of respect and gratitude."" o_o He jsut starreeed at me! Everyone in my -ENRICHED- english class says I say things to complexly. o.o Dood okay. ... I said this... THIS IN MY ESSAY!! And had to write it over, because he said it was to complex.. -Typetype, sneezes first.- xX... -Types one sentence to lazy to type out the rest.- --;;;

""Allowing for polemical exaggeration-- after all, he devotes a whole chapter to this ""Essentially valueless"" author"" 

o_o -Did a report on W. C. Brownell.- >_>; So yeah, when I write things for school, I get very serious. o_o; Just like when I sing or draw I get really serioust. Then again, I'm almost always serious. Well, in reality that is. On the net, I'm just some fucking nut...

I'm currently watching Tottaly Spies. >_> Oh yeah, Lisa is watching this as a last resort, for she wants her Ryan, and her anime. ;_; ..Oooooo!!!!! OoO Guess what?!?!! Ashley says when she get's her house, in Ny that is, and I'm up there wif my mommeh and all, she said that Ryan could come spend the weekend with us, because she wants to meet him before she knows it's safe for me to go up there with him. Dood, the fifth, will be our fifth month ani. o_o... Nananana, when she gets her house in july, that'll be like..ten months for us?! o___o.. Oh m' fuck it does not seem that long. >_> Danananana, nothing else has been happening besides that, new obsessions have came... like.. ._. Moi dix Mois... It's 4:24, .. I'ma go. n.n

So after that, I left him an offline then trotted to bed, soon found I couldn't sleep, so I got up and got dressed, threw on my hoodie and headed down to Wake.

People see me as this girl who doesn't care about anything, and doesn't care if she fails at things, and here she is with the highest grade in the class room and the only one who keeps quiet and actually listens. o-O;; AND WHO CAN SPELL!! XD Everyone asks me how to spell things. >>

My aunt said she thinks I'm smarter then my dad. >>; He called last night, from oklahoma, and told her he wouldn't be in until around ten this morning. XD.. And he didn't know when exactly the bus would arrive and depart. My aunt told me this when she got off the phone with him, and I asked, ""Doesn't he have a schedule on his card?"" She just looked at me and said, ""I think you're smarter then you're dad."" XDD In some aspects I do, I have to teach him to use all the technological stuff in the house, like the computer, and the DVD player, or Chris's X-Box.

I have about fifteen minutes until I switch to math. -Sighs.- I really don't know why I feel this way. I was fine yesterday, a little mad at my dad for not coming home when he said he would, but you have to excuse him for that, because the wheather. Speaking of wheather, the roads here are frozen, and the school district still made us go to school. Don't ask me why either, probably because we just got off break.

Walking to my house yesterday, my neighbor stuck his hed out the door and flashed the rock sign then said, ""Skate or die dude."" I blinked then went, ""Hm?"" He's all.. ""Skate or die dude!!"" o_o;; I wsa kinda scared, considering last year when I was down herre in the summer, I asked his name, and he wouldn't tell me. >> And I flirted with him in the summer whilst he mowed the lawn. o_o; Oh come on, he's about seventeen and he's hot. >>; And I was a little prep/wigger type thing last year.. kinda.. no wait, I was the little prep/wiger thing in the early months, but then I changed to goth, don't ask me how. XD I just did, probably the influence from my sister and Adam. (Ex fiance.) 

Yeah, I'm sure you all remember Adam.. ._. I fucking hated him. When Ash broke up with him, I just gave her sympathy, because I didn't want to make her feel worse then she did. I mean, he wanted to control everything she did, to what she wore, and who she talked to, if Ryan ever got like that.. >>.... I'm sorry, but there would be alot of arguing. .-. I do not like being controlled and I can see why Ashley wouldn't want to be controled, especially by a man younger then her. XD. Yes, Adam was a year younger then her, I think. o_O; 

Narrrr, I can't access anything. Tis not fair, I want to get into my journal, but it won't let me in damnit. I guess I'll do my normal, and send this to myself through mail, and post it up when I get home. ._.; Tis 10:30, I have six minutes until I leave for Math. ._. Math... xx; I dun wanna go to Math, but mesa doesn't skip classes, which means I have to fuggen go. ._.; I wish I wasen't so....obidient? >> Yeah, let's go with that.

And now I must go, for it is time to go, yes it is. And now I must sneeze. xx; -Sneeze!- Bai bai!

"event","Okay, I'm not going to mention what happened the other day at Wal-Mart with my dad. But tonight is my juvinile appointment... vv;; Three hours.

Okay, so I've not been able to update lately because my internet explorer was fucking up. Sorry all, so I'll give you some of the details.

 I got Tony's present. ^^;; Thank you Tony. I got my mommeh's ^^..Danke mommeh! And I got something from my sister Ash.. Another Bob ^_^... He's so soft, I slept wif him last night, along with Arr and my original Bob. I opened em, yeah. From tony, a necklace, a bracelette, a glowing crystal wif an angel in it. Sorry, went to the post office for a few minutes to send out Ryan's gifts. Now all I have left to send out is Tony and C-Sama.. Now back to what I was saying before I left. From my mommeh I got a personalized journal, a Gameboy Advanced SP, and game, wif a cheat book, then a Bob from Ashley. ^^ A new white one, that's heart is supposed to beat, but it got tossed around in the mail and it no work anymore. ;-;. S'okay though. ^^...  volume two, and some pocky! o-O;; Which is ALL gone.

Okey, today..was faculty vs. students dodge ball game, at firest I just stood there, whilst my team got the shit kicked ou of them, Then I got hit in the face wif a ball...TWICE!! -Rubs her cheek.- =/ I knida got a little mad, and started taking down teachers. ^_^;;;;;; Never piss me off when I'm playing dodge ball, those balls will hit you at thirty or fourty miles per hour. Ahehe ^^....the last eight teams sucked ass. =/. And we were the only team that won. Mr.Andrews cheats!! >_<... -Was sitting their stomping her feet on the bleachers and chanting cheater with everyone else.- Heh.

 Okey, er..hn, what else has happened. ^_^ I talked to my mommeh on the phone. Eh, I are going home in May. We're not sure when, but she promised me I could come home. And she only breaks promises if she HAS to. And I understand why I can't go home to visit for Christmas. vv;; 'Cause she is getting surgery done.. Whilst working she tore all the ligaments in her thumb, and they disengrated, so they have to take some from her other hand. They're not even putting her to sleep! o_o;; Then we both had a minor cry ,and I told her how miserable I am here. vv;; She asked if I was as miserable there as I am here. Truth is, I wasen't. I love my dad yes, and Christopher, though sometimes he acts just like my dad and it triggers the need to stab him and big sister more. vv;

 At the Christmas party I went to at my grandma'a all I did is sit in front of the fire and stare into it. I almost cried once. It just didn't feel right without them there... -Shrugs.- Christmas and holidays aren't a good time for me anymore because of that reason. So if I seem a little down, you know why. Anyway, at my nanna's I got a new sketch pad... @_@ Thank god! I have a page left in my other one. Two drawing books, colored pencils.. << Got enough of those. Hn, more sketching pencils, a unicorn crystal that glows, a new CD player.. << I'm happy about that too, considering I broke mine... I dropped it when I was bumped into at school. x.x And I got...MORE makeup, that's right.. MORE...XD I have to much as it is!! Half of it I don'

Hn, from Brock, I got an Inuyasha Book, all about the creators and how the anime came to be from the manga. And he's also getting me a 'How to draw manga' book. ^^ And from Tim.. Bunchhh of Yugihoh, maybe thirty. I have like 156 XD..And Arr.. @____@...Arr is my little one eyed racoon. He's a carebear cousin. I saw him in Wal-Mart and had to have him. He was dirty and had one eye, so I whined and Tim bought him for me... >>

Ahem, what else has been going on you guys don't know about. Hn..yeah, stress is ont only building up on me, but Ryan.. -Pets him idly.- I've heard the story before, because I live it. Either one: Everyone excpects him to get all good grades, and he tries to, but sometimes can't. Or two: STRESS @_@.... Yeah, last night.. vv;; Oo I was a bitch. And I must apologize to him.. He had a project due today in History, and hadn't started on it yet, and I was pushing him to do, so I guess he just said fuck it and went and layed down. =/

I was on the phone wif C-Sama last night. And Ryan the previous night..heh. C-Sama's mother said when I go back to NY, maybe I can go camping wif her in the summer. ^^ And C-Sama even said it was odd, because her mother is so overprotective.

The night on the phone with Ryan.. ^^ heh. Two nights ago. I was..VERY upset and pacing back and forth in my living room, almost near tears. But some how he pulled me through it, and I ended up laying down on my dad's bed and giggling my ass off until ten till twelve. ^^ He thinks my speaking Japanese is cute. XD Aishiteiru Hotaru-Sama! <3

Besides from those things, nothing intresting has happened... So I'ma go watch some anime wif my DVD player.. <<...Yeah, or watch some Fomay..

"event","<P>The past..two weeks have been up and down for me. -Nod.- I know, some days I was giddy and happy. Well, it's called an act. I have so much on my mind... Let me explain..</P>
<P>&nbsp;Okay, so Saturday was the the start of my.. 'monthly' I ended it yesterday. Three days, what I usually go. So.. I've been a little more emotional these past few days. Just..-sighs.- I 'unno, I've been extremely iratbale, especially with Christopher... He bugs me, taunts me...accuses me of things. And if he isn't right, no one is. He argues how many Civil War plates he broke, or how many my dad bought, or how many are currently on the hutch in the dining room... or... what grades I get. =/ They're my fucking grades. And then, one day I brought home a C on a test, and got bitched at non-stop. Chris looked at me, and called me stupid, and that I failed because I was stupid, and that...it was my own fault mom treated me that way. Some aspects I'll agree with him, but no mother leaves her daughter alone on her thirteenth birthday, come back, and expect to find her happy and lively...do they? No, didn't think so... </P>
<P>Off the subject of my mother...Now my dad, he's pushing me to get higher grades then what I can, I'm getting A's, except for PE because I skipped so many dressings, I probably have an F or a D. I'll never hear the end of it for that. Tomorrow night I have a solo.. in which the lines I do not know, because my work and extra classes are piled up. I'm on the school council and newspaper, glee club, and choir. I can't get into anymore...&gt;&lt; I cannot be any fucking smarter then I am... -_-;; Stop...pressuring me... IF I'M NOT CAPABLE OF DOING IT LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE...And...my grades are dropping..hurendously... vv;;</P>
<P>Ahem... I'm not really paying much attention to anything anymore, the computer is starting to hold no meaning to me, I'm losing myself in my reading, and writing...and drawing. I've drawn over thirty pictures in four days, and read three books in a week, not to mention I have four note books full of writing..of nothing more then little rants and rambles for over three weeks now? I'm staring to do what I used to do, and isolate myself from everything and everyone... And now as I sit here and type this out, I see no meaning to it at all.. =/ A computer is just a machine, not my life line. No one is really....real? ...I can never see them.. I can never truely hold them, or hug them or tell them I care...Nope..so why bother and talk to them? Sure, I'm going to miss them..fuck...I'll miss the hell&nbsp;out of&nbsp;them, but...I'm slipping into a bubble, and no one can get in it but me. How I used to be...</P>
<P>Ryan..wow, how can I explain this to him. vv; He means so much to me, these past days when I wasen't able to get on, he was all I would think about, when Brittany and I were lounging on my bed and talking this afternoon all I did was go back on happy little memories and giggle.. like the first time I saw his reaction to me looking at hentai.. On his cam.. o_o...Wait Lisa no O___O.... Heh... I'll miss him if I do decide to leave, I 'unno if I will or not yet... I'll still keep in touch with him.. atleast I hope I will..</P>
<P>C-Sama, I'm slowly slipping away from her, she said tonight, the only things she can think about that make her happy are sleeping...and Tony (Kage-San).... I wonder if I ever really did make her happy, if I ever did..help her... vv;;; </P>
<P>Kage-San.... Barely EVER talk to him anymore, he's..just.. I love him to death but. -Shrugs- I 'unno anymore.</P>
<P>And let's not forget about Greenie. My little Greenie... -Pets him idly.- He also holds a big part of my life. -Smiles.- I love him..in a mutual way of course, heh... I try to hold out for him, and make him proud of me.. I do sometimes, then sometimes I slip, like every now and then I'll sneak a cigarette, or take a drink of beer. Like I did when at Ashley's...</P>
<P>I'm gonna go, I'm gonna stop my rant, put these things behind me, and try to be happy...Or atleast look it... Goodnight...</P>
<P>Lisa</P>"

Six Wierd Facts about Me~

1. I chew my fingernails for so long now, I've mastered to use my teeth as a precise scissors... My nails are bitten in an almost perfect round shape... I know, I knw, bad thing... But that's me.

2. I have to be in a special mood to watch movies. I don't know why, but I just cannot watch them just to make time pass by.

3. My body works in 7/8 music rhythm. 1-2-3 1-2- 1-2! I am sure of that. Nothing moves me on better than songs sung in 7/8...

4. What I believe in cannot be found in any religion. I am an Orthodox Christian because of family tradition, but my true beliefs are somewhat different and in strong connection with science. And no - I am not in any sect!

5. I've chosen what Univ. to attend upon a dream I had... I could be a doctor... Became a civil engineer... :)

6. I have some major 'gothic girls' flaw... If they only knew that all they should say to me is 'hi' and I'd fall in love... :D

I don't want to tag noone since I don't know when I'll be able to watch and post again... Going to Canada on Friday! Weeeee! I cannot wait!"

"event","Yay! Miss Psy tagged me to do this... Although I don't know her that well, I'll try to answer all questions:

1. Who are you?
MoscowBeast. Misko is other nickname of mine. Idiot is not :)
2. Are we friends?
In a way I feel like that. Electronic ones :)
3. Whats my full name?
Valerie Ann? Have I got it right?
4. When is my birthday?
I could look on the LJ but don't want to. Was it somewhere in... I give up! 18. December... I never could remember those :(
5. Am I tall, short, or average?
I would guess short.
6. Do I have any siblings?
Err... Dunno... I know you spoke of some sister but in a way that made me not to ask what happened to her... And I stil won't!
7. When and how did we meet?
On deviantArt, I've commented your first stock pictures and asked you to make another one so I could make a manip... I guess you liked it ;)
8. When you first saw me, what was your impression?
My Gosh, she is pretty! (hey what can I say, I am an honest guy!)
9. How have I affected you?
You have drawn me a pic. Of me. As a beast. And I love it!
10. What do you think of me?
Very down to earth and rational person for the amount of emotions you hold inside; altruistic, even more than myself (and I thought it was impossible); openminded and outgoing
11. What's the fondest memory you have of me?
Gee... I don't know what to answer here. I've never seen you in person...
12. How long do you think we will be friends?
As long as we can stand each other ;)
13. Do you love me?
I don't want to use the word 'love'... That would not be true, coz I don't know you enough. I like you very much though.
14. Do you have a crush on me?
No, don't worry. My crush is on someone else, you can rest easy ;)
15. Would you kiss me?
To kiss a girl is an offer no guy would refuse. But I would do it only if asked... or made to. ;)
16. Would you hug me?
Without a doubt! :hug:! :D
17. Physically, what stands out?
Dunno, never saw you in person, just in pics. In those I love your eyes and hair...
18. Emotionally, what stands out?
You are incredibly nice person, emotional to the bone, but in strong control over those emotions. I envy you somewhat on that.
19. Do you wish I was cooler?
Why would I? I tend to accept everyone as they are.
20. On a scale of 1-10, how hot am I?
As I've said, I don't really know how you look in person. In pictures you look close to 9 :) (and because you are a woman you will sure ask me why not 10 - because noone is a 10! :) )
21. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it.
I already call you 'miss'. But if you want new one... Lets say... P.V. Like PeeVee :) For one - its an abbrev of your nick and name (Psyko Valerie), and for second, it sounds like 'chick' said in a cuddly way in my language. But not in a bad way... In my language guys often call girls they love 'chick' (not girlfriends only, but female close friends in general)
22. Am I loveable?
Very!
23. How long have you known me?
Ohhh... lemme see... From somewhere in October 2005, that means... almost 6 months :)
24. Describe me in one word.
Incredible!
25. Whats something you dont like about me?
Err... Somewhat a bit like myself - we are too generous to others, sometimes even when it can turn back on us... You think of others more than of yourself.
26. Do you still think that way about me now?
Err.. Nothing has changed in the last 20 seconds I guess? :)
27. What do you think my weakness is?
Too emotional...
28. Do you think I'll get married?
After reading your last posts I guess not, at least on short terms... But when you least expect it things can turn at 180 degrees.
29. Would you ever go out with me?
I guess I'd ask you... But that is the decision that has to be done by you... And don't worry, I will not ask you for a real date, just lunch when I pass by your town :)
30. What makes me sad?
Can I say it? It has something to do with love...
31. What reminds you of me?
Cuddly teddy bears and eyebrow piercings :)
32. If you could give me anything what would it be?
Love you deserve (which does not have to be from me, don't misunderstand this one!)
33. How well do you know me?
Not as well as I'd like.
34. When's the last time you saw me?
Never... I spoke to you on MSN some week ago I guess. Notes and comments on dA aside :)
35. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't?
Not that I can recall of...
36. Do you think I could kill someone?
I strongly believe you could not, unless life of someone you love was at stake...
37. What would you do or say if i started smoking? drugs? cutting?
Smoking? I'm indifferent, despite it influences my health too. Drugs - I'd try to convince you to quit. Cutting - I'd take you to the doctor, unconscious if needed...

I will not tag many people to do this, coz I know what people I love think of me... I tag you - Psy! A-ha! Right back on you! ;D"

"event","This happens to me sometimes. I have the irresistable urge to be creative. It is not some rush of inspiration, it's just some weird feeling that something needs to be created by this mind, these hands, these eyes and ears... Problem is - this urge never comes along with some inspiration, with some idea, with anything in perticular (is this the way to write it? gee dunno :) ) that could help it fulfill itself... So I sit here, midnight has passed, talking to a friend on msn and biting nails off for the lack of inspiration...

I had to say this to someone :) Don't metion it ;)"

"event","Okay, I am getting a bit bored because of the lack of work these days. I know they taught us that building is virtually impossible thing to do when it's -15 outside, but still this is Russia and they know how to build even on lower temperatures... And not all my colleagues are idle, some of them are working their butts off. What really bothers me is that it always comes back around on me. This is just life's way of telling me: ""Son, you take time to rest now coz there is an avalanche of duties rolling your way..."" It has been like that a couple of times - on my last job I even managed to smuggle some movies and games into my computer so that I don't eat my heels off coz of boredom... And then bang! For three days I was working late, one day even till 1 am... I just wonder how really big is that avalanche that is runing towards me, coz all I do form start of 2006. is - surfing, blogging, emailing and things like that...

I'll spend this halfday somehow (other half is reserved for visiting doctor and getting my therapy for back)... I hope not to fall asleep..."

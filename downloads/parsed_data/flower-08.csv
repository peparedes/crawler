""A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.""


""A friend is someone who is there for you when he'd rather be anywhere else."" 

A friend is a shoulder to lean on, an ear to listen, and a heart to comfort. 

""A friend is one who knows you as you are, understands where you've been, accepts who you've become, and still invites you to grow"

"event","I stopped writing in my other Live Journal cause I never get any comments. I was hoping maybe with a new set of friends on here,I might will see. I went into work to get my check and my manager was mean to me about my other job that has since ended. I was late one day last week and she said if you can't get here on time we will find someone to come in and cover. Take in mind I was working till midnight then coming in between 7:00am-8:00am and only one day I was ten minutes late. I don't think that is bad considering. I need a job were I can be recognized and where I don't get critcized for little things. All and all I think I've moved on from that job and being off for three weeks and coming back just makes me realize it more and I can also do a less stressful job and get paid more. I miss that my temp job ended. I liked being busy.  I liked making more money. I hate just sitting around. I like to be productive. I guess that's it for my rant thanks for anyone that listened."

I am issuing a challenge to each and every single person on my friends list.<lj-cut>
There are three things I want you to do in the coming days. They are simple things and will not cost you a lot of time, money or effort.


Donate $20 towards helping the Hurricane Katrina victims.

Give blood.

Spread the word in your Livejournals by linking to this post or posting your own request for YOUR FListers to do the same.

I know. I know. Money is tight right now for everyone. With rising gas prices, many of us are suffering a bit too. That said, look around you. If you woke up in a bed in your own home this morning, had food to eat, clothes to wear and a job to go to or the ability to find a job if necessary you have a thousand times more than the victims of Katrina!!!!

How could you not donate $20 and give blood to help out these people? 

You may donate your $20 any way you choose. You may make a donation through the American Red Cross, via Google and Amazon.com, The Network for Good or any local charity in your area that is collecting funds for Hurricane Katrina relief. Glenn Miller has put together a master list of charities and relief agencies that are accepting donations at this time. 

You may spend $20 to purchase the following needed items:


Toothbrushes and toothpaste

Cleaning supplies

Paper goods

Bottled water

Non-perishable food items

Diapers

Baby food

Contact your local radio station and local food bank to find out where you may drop off your $20 of goods for the hurricane victims. $20 is not a huge amount of money folks. If each and every single one of you on my friends list spent $20 in the next few days, we would send $2300 of needed items and/or food and water to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

If you spread the word on your friends list, how much more could we accomplish?!?!

To find out where you can give blood, please visit the American Red Cross site. This link will take you directly to an area where you can find a blood drive in your area.

Naturally, if you can give more please do so. If you have clothes, stuffed animals, books, games, towels, ANYTHING that you have been meaning to truck off to Goodwill, please take it to the Salvation Army instead. They will donate all goods to the victims of the hurricane.

If you have any other ideas about how to help, please reply in comments and I will happily post it. Feel free to link to this post or create your own challenging folks to give JUST $20 and to DONATE BLOOD. Then ask them to pass it on.

Again, I know money is tight for everyone right now. But if ALL of us gives just $20, think of what we can accomplish for people who have nothing.</lj-cut>"

I said no the thing is she lives 15 minutes in the other direction then I was going and I had plans with friends an hour from then. Why do I feel bad about this? I would have otherwise but it is out of my way."

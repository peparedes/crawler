"event","Hey everyone, I'm doing a project for my alternative media class and need some help. The assignment is to do a subversive fashion project and mine will include as many pictures as possible of people making a ""model face"". I'm trying to include lots of photos of people from outside the normal (skinny, symmetrical, young) model category. I've been going up to people and asking them to pose and, though they tend to feel silly, they usually say yes. I've gotten a lot of great pictures so far but for my project to work the way I want I'll need a lot more. So, if you could send me a picture of you, and anyone else willing, giving the camera that silly ""I'm bored, I'm hot, and you love it"" face that would be great! This does not have to be done with a great camera, you can do it with your web cam or camera phone or anything.You don't need to touch them up at all either, this is about real people, pores and all. The finished product will be published online and possibly in an installation.
Thanks gorgeouses!

He invited everyone to send a picture of their message to the world on what is said to be the most miserable day of the year (today)and that he would try to post them. However, it kind of back fired, considering it pretty much made my day. My theory is that he was just trying to give everyone a fun little activity to make up for the sucky day- what a pal.

"event","I just took up smoking, no worse, I took up, for possibly the eighth time in my life, journaling whilst depressed. perhaps i was not ""depressed"" during my other phases of deep felt masturbation of banal human pain but who cares if a rich know nothing doctor signed off on a specific condition for me or not? they can't prove it or cure it so noticing it seems much like the dinosaurs saying we're about to be extin....aahahhahhaha. except perhaps it wouldn't turn into laughter at the end. but you know, i think dinosaurs took extinction better than we would.  
today is hallowweeeennn. and it appears i shall be staying in. i am quite rightly wearing my i <3 men with the ""n"" crossed out sweatshirt, i am feeling super feminist tonight. i'm such an ovary hugger. except i don't like most women. or men. or myself. and i detest myself for my dislike because that makes me so much like everyone else!
all of us have spider Jerusalem in us, small and educated or not. but that seething desire to punch in the face smiling across from us, glowing with a halo of all their ignorance to our own, superior enlightened process of ""see, hear, interpret"".
i am drunk and don't feel like writing much more except that maybe i've discovered some things this fine evening day in my life that have first prompted me to begin this mother fucking send me to hell with all the other preteens who cry about their friends haircuts being perfect and how they wish they were hannah montanahanahanaha. 
from this point on i really need to learn the lesson that i am alone. the big one. along with, life is short, we are insignificant, every little bit counts, every little bit doesn't count, all you can do is your best, be yourself, and all the other disgusting points of enlightenment most all of us experience in a life, often more than once. aloneeee. number one beth. mememe. 
yes it is because i found out once again that the boy i am living with lied to me again. he thinks that because it wasn't with malicious intent, that makes it ok. but that just isn't true, failing to be considerate is failing, even though you didn't purposely forget that you aren't the only person in the world that matters.
but maybe he is right. i suppose that is what i've learned, though he seems to be living his life with this knowledge already or just accidentally pre-entlightened. no one is ever going to be trustworthy or perfect for me. so mememe. no more i'm third that my family taught me. god. others, me. no, mememe. and alcohol and drugs and a dog and ART. i cannot live with anyone other than him because they won't except me as who i am and let me be free. and i cannot live my life around him because he will always let me down and i have emotions the size of a bride ten minutes before the dodo. 
omgomgfuck no. nono! essentially what i am saying here is lower my expectations isn't it. FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK that is what my therapist said! 

note to self: shut the FUCK up.

to do: get money so you can buy everything on your list

list of things to buy:
-the perfect vibrator
-as much food as i want
-d r u g s
-pen pal supplies
-art supplies
-supplies for doggie or whatever pet i choose to be my companion
-music
-house in norhternish area, not too cold
-books
-all necessities and tools to carry out my life job

my to buy list sums up my life goals now, i think you can picture my future DEAR READER
i think it might work. i'm a little worried i'm commit suicide a month in...

how to get such money and immediate goals
no fucking clue.
writers get to live off by themselves right? write?
hahaha buy something that laughs at my jokes?

the best servant would be a crazy one that you convince they are a presidential candidate and that you are the populous. they are let go on the day of the vote, til they they try to be golden angels and try to fulfill their promises and be all they can be.

my existence will need tweaking. i might need to try an experiment of living without humans. see if i can do it. cause maybe sometimes i love them

So I'm going to be posting that over the next week or so, it is mainly photography and painting....

"event","My summer with Ian has been amazing. First we went up North to visit his entire family, and sure it was a little stressful (mainly cause I got sick) but they were great. Then we came back to Savannah and got all tucked in to our home. I've been learning how to ride a bike in the city which is getting easier though still freaks me out a bit. Also have been playing some flute, reading some Sandman, and just being happier and felt more at home than I have in a while.
Anywho, these are two photos from when Ian's dad let me play on his drum set. the first one i took and the one where i'm totally rocking out ian took.

The Unbosoming
by Olena Kalytiak Davis
 

I have been a day boarder, Lord. I have preferred the
    table to the Bed.
I have proffered, Lord, and I have profited, Lord,
    but little, but not. I was Bored,
Lord, I was heavy, Lord. Heavy bored. Hopeless,
    Lord, hideous, Lord. Sexless.
I was in love, Lord, but not with You. The nine
    malic moulds, Lord.
The butcher, the baker, the under-taker. Lord, I was
    taken under. I Repeat
Myself, Lord. I re-peat myself as the way back, the
    way back to Myself,
Lord. I have trembled, Lord. His face, Lord, and Yours.
    I am unlovely, Lord, I Nam
Not precious, Lord. Spy better, Love, and You will see:
    I nam nothing. I have Seen
How lovely, Lord, how lovely You are, Lord, but I refused
    to kneel. I Refuse
To knell Your loveliness. I refuse to kiss. And I refuse
    to tell. I am unwilling, Love.
I am unwell. Unkempt. My hideous loins, Love. My body,
    which is all Wrack
And screw, Love. All slack and crewel. At Your beck and
    call, Love, at His Beck
And call. Crestfallen, Love. Of the fallen breast.
    Un-clean of eye. Loose of Thigh.
Ridiculous, Love. Most serious, Love. Unshod. Unshriven.
    In vain and in Rain,
 

Love. I live and I Wire. I Wive, Lord, but I Fathom Not"

"event","So I was going to leave school friday, but then on Thursday I agreed to be a last minute actor in a short film some friends were making. We started filming Sunday at like 7 am and didn't finish til like 8 30 that night; then of course we had to have an after party to celebrate our success. It was tons of fun. I play a rather masculine girl, Courtney/Dylan, who identitfies as male and who does not get along with her ridiculous roommate, Bart. Bart refuses to respect her and in the beginning he throws me in the shower, at one point I slap him in the face while choking him on the floor, at another point he is working out with two jugs of wine, at ANOTHER point i rub heads with a girl while our hair is covered in aloe, and in the end we happily wrap him in tape. Sooooo pretty much it's going to be the best short film ever. And I've never acted before but I think it went well. Here is a picture of  me as Courtney and Blacki as ""Bart"":

enough ooo's. 

so i was introduced to a guy from Sheryl Crowe's band. It was not planned and took me totally off guard and while i said i liked her i couldn't think of one song she played. so i shook hands with him(he had straightened hair and split ends)and I had no idea what to say. so I said how awesome it must be to play music for a living, and he asked if i was a musician. I could have said so many things...I've performed in disney world, toured with a singing group around europe, and sang the national anthem at a major league baseball game (with a group, i'm truly not great). but no. none of those came to mind, all i could think to say was: ""well, i've got this great two dollar key board i got from a thrift store and it has some really cool disco noises... sooo i play with that when i'm bored. good fun.....""
 pathetic. or so he was thinking i'm pretty sure based on the ""ick"" look on his face. and he's probably going to be like hey sheryl guess what this crazy girl said... i just hope they don't write a song about the silly girl with the disco keyboard. oi.

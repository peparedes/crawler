i have been redeemed. there are absolutely no other words for the emotions that are coursing through my body. my face showed such emotion during that meeting but i don't care, i did not care. i was gypped my presidency last year far too many times. i'm elated it didn't happen again.

i am so proud. butterfly and such emotions, shivers. pure happiness and bliss. 

redemption is a sweeter revenge."

"event","been real bad about this posting thing. life kinda sucks with being busy and all. gotta grow up in a few hundred days. who woulda thunk? i was supposed to have done this already, should've graduated in may of 2004 but didn't. 

i'm glad and not glad i stayed. it's helped but i feel that in a way i was only putting off the inevitable. but at the same time i need the time off. it was necessary to get my bearings, to realize what it is that i kind of wanted to do with my life. i mean i know that i want to work with helping people, children especially (and no no that in that nasty way) but after camp and hi-hello (the daycare center i worked at for two summers), i'm pretty sure that my life is aimed at helping. it sucks because it doesn't pay, but it's want i want to do. what will fulfill me, not my bank account or a lavish lifestyle but, it's what i want to do. especially at least for now. it's not that my mind will change about helping people, but at one point maybe helping will be in a different way. i can't do a 9 to 5 job in a cubicle or something that doesn't have me doing something. yes it's stressful and nerve-wrecking but that's how i love my life. i'm applying to the city year program (run my americorps). my dream was to do the peace corps but that's too much of a commitment, don't get me wrong i could. but i have too many things keeping me to the continental united states. mainly? my little sister. she is my life. i don't think people realize how much i truly mean that. it's scary but one of my biggest fears is my parents dying and my having to give up everything, not that i won't be able to, but what will i have? how will i be able to care for her? i mean i have cared for her but money wise, that's where my parents come in. so yeah i'm afraid of that. lets say i'm off doing some volunteer work, or low paying job and something happens... what do i do then? how would i be able to care for her then? and this is my irrational fear of something happening.

and now terri has been tickling me during this whole post, or at least 3/4 of the post. and now she's special and gets to be in this. lexie too, she asked me if i was writing a book. 

schools been interesting. it's fun having a lot of classes, lol... NOT. but they are interesting i will give you that. ohhhh and work has been great too. went to make my second payment plan payment (first one was $370 and change back in december) and i accidentally charged my parents the $1309.06 i owe. not just the $327.40... the full fuckin' 1300 dollars. so mad at myself. i mean it went through so yay! but still... i called them because checks didn't come in as i was expecting and well i know they are there for me and ... yeah. so now i owe my dad 1300 grand over the school. he said to take my time, which i will and won't. i want to graduate with the least, least amount of debt and the most amount of savings. i will probably go back to camp and save up those 1700 (after taxes). ohhh taxes coming back to me, going to the parents. woot! (yes i realized that right now as i was typing this)

okay back to buffy. it's the graduation part 2 episode and my favorite part is coming up so i'm off... that's a semi update... woot!"

life: never, ever give up or stop having faith in what you believe in but realize and know when it's time to walk away. it doesn't mean that you don't care but it means that you've got to stop hurting yourself. 

camp: always give people a chance, help them out but if they aren't willing to take it and appreciate it... you can't do anything about that and they won't gain all the knowledge and love you did for the job. 

live your life and do what makes you happy. i make no excuses for who i am and who i've become.
and always surround yourself with people who love you and raise you up!

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertainin'
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
*************
*************

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake,
think i'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
you thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
and you don't understand, ohhhh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy


i know i know a lot at the end but 'chu know what? sometimes you gotta get shit out there. and what's lj for, right?"

"event","last night was a very interesting night... to say the absolute least.

i spent about 8 hours away from everything yesterday and it was a great 8 hrs. not that i don't love everyone an everything but i just needed ro-k time. then went to oscars with lex, jordie, and terri. terri was not aware of what had transpired in the last few days, so she was filled in. long story short, NOT happy but i had also calmed down with my last time, i really hope, in telling the story. then jordie gave me a pretty blue old navy sweater, which we are going to match (green for her though) for our RHSA secret snowflake thinger. 

came back to scuds with terri and lexie. then lexie gave me a present as well. i got a pretty blue aero sweater, which i'm wearing to today's Welcome Center secret snowflake thing. woot for gifts! terri did our hair (straighten) and make-up. yeah i got makeup put on me, i don't like wearing it bc i think i look uglier with makeup on. but i digress. then i got dressed up and then i changed my whole outfit lol. i ended up with my boobies out in a black halter, which terri and jordie told me i wasn't allowed to change. (wore a jacket and scarf and i left my scarf at 'cuddys :() some of the lenape crew was there (beryl, tracey, and colleen) it was awkard but walked away from it okay. terri talked to tracey and then next thing i know tracey is buying me a shot (red headed slut) and somehow we have made up. not perfect of course lol but we both realized we were both quite stupid with the things we did. i was stupid for picking a boy over her (or at least def not making time for her) and she shouldn't have reacted the way she did over a boy. but we are okay (:shrug:), not besties but talking again. beryl and colleen were nice too but meh... those friendships i don't know if i really would like back, if at all. beryl was funny though, outside drunk and smoking cigarettes and talking to random ass strangers. i couldn't take the cold and how she was embarrassing herself so i just left. had a red-headed slut shot with jordie (yay i buy my daughter a drink) and had overall i think about 4 or 5 amarettos sours last night. and my last drink of the night was a shot i brought for tracey and me, which this time was documented by terri. overall great night. had fun drinking and dancing. 

lexie and i got to talking this morning though and she brought up the point... well i'll finish soon kristyn is doing me a huge favor so i'll be back soon!"

"event","so i finally broke up with him. and for my first 6 hrs i think i've done a good job. i LOVE lexie (for reasoning with me), jordie (for walking over past midnight), tara (for being so calm and just smiling and wishing me the best), and especially kristyn (i only say this bc she's made me laugh the most-- and kris lol). thank you girls, from the bottom of my heart. i know you won't all see this but know i can't express to you guys how much i appreciate it. 

hard times are ahead, two and a half years almost, of an up and down relationship down the drain over cheating. (which i just realized that the saturday it happened, that sunday was our anniversary...) :sigh: i should have known but i wanted to hope and wish for better. but i will get over this. it will get better. and honestly i will find someone who is worth it. who will know what i'm worth and won't throw me around. 

but still it's 2 years with my first love and that will be hard. jordie is right when she says that i won't stop loving him, probably ever, but it is for the best. i can't change him. i can't have hope and faith in someone who doesn't want to try or make an effort. i'm too good of a person for having stayed for all that i did.

well now moving on. it'll be hard. but i went to dubs today while he was there, yes only the main door bc lex and i forgot milk, but still...

i got this. and even if every night i cry. i won't during the daytime."

"event","Bitter Cold

 hopelessness and despair kicking in.
i'm curling up in my bed and crying until i'm dried out.

and then a new day will kick in. and i'll do it all over again.

and the nights will always be consumed with my despair.
and the days will always be consumed with my facade.

but the nights will creep up on me. and they will envelop me.
they will take over, from the moment it turns colder and colder.

that's how i'll become.

i will be awoken to the morning sun. the air outside will still be cold,
but like me
          it will thaw out and become warmer and nicer.

i will be in good company. they can't know what i'm going through though.
[they can't ever know again]                                    [this is my own fight]
to them i am happy (okay) with life and everything.

day by day. night by night.
smile by smile and tear by tear.

what will become of me? (who will i become?)
does anyone know? (does anyone want to know?)

who can save me? (who will care enough to?)
who knows? (not i, not anyone)

why will no one be there? (why is there no one left?)
because they can't know / won't know / don't want to know (they are done)

when will it be resolved? (when will it get better?)
or will it continue? (never, until it stops)

how will it end? (or will it start?)
better than it began. (back to it to begin anew)

why? (why not?)
pain and an emptiness that can't be fixed. (i can't let anyone in enough to trust them after all of this)


~ 159 days to go"

"event","i'm so happy that lina imed this morning. she'd finally gotten a letter from ashley (one of our frontier girls session 3/4). she decided during session 4 that she was going to sing a song and from there she wrote on while lina accompanied her on the guitar. it is such a cute and great song. we helped her write it and i've never been so proud, here goes:

Summer's ending
i was wasting my time
away from you
but the time we have left
i want to be with you
have longer days and longer nights to be forever

Do you remember when you first looked into my eyes?

I looked at your face you
looked at my eyes
and we knew
this summer will change me
will change you

will change the way we see our little world
will change everything about us
so now its all ending

Remember the smells
remember the shells
remember the waves crashing into us
as you held on tight never letting go
Knowing i'll be gone soon

Do you remember when you first looked into my eyes?

Now its gone
Now its done
Now i'll never see you again

Everyone! (remix hehe)

it's such a sad song but i love it and it's so catchy too. i wish i had recorded her singing this song.

now onto finishing up moving my room."

working at the welcome center has been great. if you call 845-257-SUNY or 845-257-2121 i might just be the one to pick up and help you with your problem, lol.

"event","camp has been an interesting time so far. had one set of girls for two sessions. started with 12 and then only 7 came back. best and worst times of my life. glad i'm in hideaway though. i would've loved to be C.I.T. director with the girl there but i feel that i'm doing better where i am. i'm gonna miss my girls and all their jokes. sure they had me ready to kill them or myself because of how crazy things were but in the end one or two of them were the one's who made everything difficult. the ""good"" ones would realize, call them out on it and make things better.

well off to bed soon... then half the day in NP then spending it with lina and some ppl in fishkill."

saw sooo many pretty cars. very excited and now i wish i knew how to drive.

conclusions i've come to. any blue or pretty blueish car i am immediately attracted to. even if it may be slightly crappy. so i need help when buying a car. i need someone there to remind me that i can get that car in another color.

conclusion number two. i like expensive cars in no matter what color. exampls: the new aston martin d9/dbs, cadillac sts, or the lambourghini. and especially the buick riviera but it was a concept car but the doors were so cool!


okay that was my story and my discovers from the car show.

yeah right we all know how that went. it actually wasn't horrible this year but it was just plain 'ol boring as hell. i was able to come back up on friday. mainly because it was the only day my dad could bring me. since i had a bunch of drinks and stuff i definitely took the ride. came up showed my fams around crispell (well mainly my suite). they liked it. um... went to the winery and then lunch, then they left. 

then i waited for tara to get back, she was at her internship. my computer decided to fuck up majorly. i couldn't get online and my itunes fucked up. i finally was able to get online but itunes decided to lose all of my music. i sat here for like 5 hours figuring this out. it sucked! um... after that i decided to clean. swiffered my room (dry and wet).... while my room was drying i decided to attack the common area. so i did and it was nasty. well under the couches it was disgusting. then went to bed and finally slept in! woot! 

on saturday tara and i went out to do errands. we went to rite aid and then blockbuster. i was in a search for a movie for erik. (wanted to get him the fox and the hound as an anniversary gift but could i find it-- no!) tara helped me look and we just didn't so i'll just buy it online, whatever! we got back and i started doing laundry and then erik came back at like 630-700ish. yay! i was happy. i barely got to talk to him all break because he was studying and doing work so we texted but did talk for a bit. no spring break plans this year sucked! we hung out in crispell till like 9ish and then we went to grab dinner. burger king didn't have icees and i was pissed! came back and than we all debated whether we should watch enchanted or wait and have a movie night of it. we decided to wait though. tara had to go home early and then her family was going to jersey for the day. erik and i had to be up early because we were going to his grandma's house so...

saturday morning went up to erik's grandma. i stayed up the whole car ride!!! woot! in the many many times that we have taken that ride up i don't think i've stayed up once. i was ecstatic but didn't mention it because then they would laugh. it's a usual occurrence that i'm sleepy or tired so i didn't say anything. (mainly because at first went i went up i was also night hosting and one night we went up at like 900 or 1000 after getting out of work at 445) got a nice easter egg with 2.60 so i was very happy, but i knew that money was going to playing cards soon so i gave the change to erik and kept the money in my pocket. erik was hungry because breakfast had consisted of 3 icee things. so he ate and then we all played some cards for a bit. erik of course decided his card games to be the longest and most complicated ones. funny though because we won one of those, i think. i messed up on won of them and it was sad because i knew how to play the game it just slipped my mind becasue i got so excited when i saw some cards. oh well. had dinner which was delicious, yay for mashed potatoes and turkey! then we drove back with tiffany and marty. that car ride i did fall asleep :( oh well can't be perfect. i was tired and it was a long day. came back and hung out in dubois. then at like 845ish i got a phone call from lexie. yay! she was coming back early! so i broke the news to erik and he was sad and he wasn't going to like lexie until 3:29 today. lexie was stuck in traffic so she was going to give me a call when she was back in new paltz. i mainly didn't want to wait by myself in the suite. no one was there so.... she called at like 1100. if she had called like 15 min later i would've been out so she was lucky. came back and talked for a bit.

now it's today. and i've got to leave for class in 13 minutes. then i've got to drop my human evolution class. done with my natural science requirements. woot for talking to the assistant dean! i took a science class last semester and i thought it counted-- it didn't. so i went to the dean and stated my case. she was surprised at how i even got in the class but she said it was okay. so yay! then playing super smash bros brawl. i have a meeting at 8 and then ac meetin (elections tonight) and yay done!

lexie and i have jobs at the bookstore. she's at the register and i am on the floor stocking and wahtnot. it should be fun. in the next ten days i am working about 82 hours... or something ridiculous like that.

yesterday was fun! finally got to see people. still haven't seen jessie since a couple of days ago when we watched american idol, which is sad but hopefully soon! went to see juno with tiffany, christina, erik, and alexis. i liked it. my one complaint though is that the baby is too big but i'm just saying. went to subway... which was yummy! then hung out for a bit. felicia came over and hung out for a bit more.

it's been the most amazing 48 hours ever! two bad things but it's not my fault (haven't seen erik-- or the other ra's too much-- and jordie can't sleep over bc of stupid rules)....

other than that woot woot!

went to across the universe yesterday at the $2 movie theater with lexie and felicia. it was creeeeeeppppyyyyyy! we parked by k-mart because it was the only place in that huge parking lot that had cars. then in that whooooole mall only k-mart had people in it. other than that good. also went food shopping at stop and shop and whoa did we have a lot of stuff. we also went to brunch with jessie and nicole. which was quite amazing. (love that i went backward)...

last night when we got back we decided to eat quickly and then do a round of the buildings. so we ate, found there was no microwave, asked tara and ultimately came back downstairs to borrow the microwave in her room... then we went to bouton and visited christina. and she gave up chinese takeout name tags. then we went over to capen to visit elena for a little bit. i helped her with a happy bunny and he was kind of special. then we went over to esopus and hung out. i felt bad because as we were walking over to bouton i realized i had left my cell phone and my id card back in the suite (had remembered my room key and my temp card and my cell phone case though... go figure....) and wasn't able to say good night to erik. although i did borrow lexie's cell and at one point lexie got a text and told me it wasn't for her because if it was it would be slightly awkward because erik was telling her that he loved her.... anyway we stayed there until like 1:15am and whoa was it bad becuase it was way past our bedtime... came back and knocked out. now i'm up and can't wait to start the day...

(oh and first day back had fun decorating and playing with r2-d2 who is amazing!!!)

so over this break i have officially become addicted to friends. i only have seasons 1-3 and i def should have brought more. but oh well since i'll be back early that'll be some time to catch up. and practice sign because i'm a lil rusty. not that i was too good to begin with but you know...

now the rest of this week basically consists of telling my dad that i need one more year of college. also i've got to help my mom with her order of about 500 tamales. considering she just got out of surgery yesterday she's still a little groggy and whatnot so we are starting tomorrow i believe. but because of her back i'm gonna help more. which personally surprises me because my mom hates asking for help. we'll see how it goes..."

"event","so i haven't been here in a couple of days. well more than a couple but still. lots and lots have happened. some of the more important highlights:

1) moved into crispell! woot woot! was very happy that i unpacked 90% in like 2 hours or so. showed up at like 940 (even though i had told tara i was going to be there @ 9am but i had to help  erik move some stuff into gage). and i was done with just about everything by 1130. only have bedding (still gotta wash and stuff) and then some little things left.

2) i <b>love love love</b> my little brother! i'm getting an R2-D2 from him!!!
well he was going to buy me an r2-d2 earlier last week but my mom didn't want to give him the money. (which was fucked up because he's earned that money). and then we went to shaper image on monday (yes i realize christmas eve not smart) and they were sold out. so he just gave me the money to order it online. so i'm having it shipped to erik's house so that i don't have to drag it with me on the bus. and a two year warranty in case the spawns of satan decide to drop kick it.

3) i've been watching house nonstop and i love it

4) my ac adapter to my laptop is broken and i'm very very very upset

5) i miss christmas' when i was younger. they were much better and i'm sad that my sister has only had very sad christmas'. it's upsetting... i'm fixing that for her next year. she was so excited for 12am and she had 1 gift to open. it really upset me. 2008 she's getting a good christmas and a good birthday party (because she's never had one of those either)

6) i dunno i just wanted to have seven highlights

7) i miss new paltz!!!

okay semi update is done
m'kay? love you buh bye!

"event","so last night was relax and recharge and the SUB had this horrible smell coming from who knows where. anyway beside the fact, although it was everywhere! we had to keep the door closed but that was kind of keeping people away so we had to put a sign on the door. it explained that we were all in there <b>but</b> that since the smell was so bad, we were keeping the door closed so the MPR wouldn't be so horrible. (and yet afterward found out SUB 100 was smelling just fine so we maybe should've had it down there...) 

had lots of fun playing apples to apples, cranium, and just being ourselves. so christina and bobby can't <u>ever</u> be on a team together. first we were all playing apples to apples and they kept getting the green cards. usually just from each other, and every once in a while from one of us. and of course i end up giving bobby the final card. which was quite upsetting. we then went to play cranium and split up into teams. felcia and i; bobby and christina; tara and alexis; and tiffany and a boy (who's name i don't know but feel that i should bc at one point he called me ro-k). christina of course needed a filter. she was drawing overalls and when she tried to draw a fly on the overalls it looked like she drew a penis. it was sooo funny to see bobby's face bc you knew what he wanted to say but didn't. and yet as she kept drawing more overalls at one point he was just like ""penis?"" it was <b>the funniest</b> thing ever on the planet!!! and of course rob walks over to look and he can't stop laughing. poor christina, right in front of our two advisros and her boss... :le sigh: at 9:20ish the sexy pitches came on to perform and they were freakin' <b><i><u>amazing</b></i></u>!!! shantell has such a great voice. i don't think i had ever heard her sing. she sang ""r-e-s-p-e-c-t"" and another girl as well but she was great!!! and we had bobby kind of whispering singing so that was a lot of fun as well because he too of course has a great voice. (which reminds me that i have to upload a video onto facebook). then when the second song came on they mentioned tims and christina and i could <u>not</u> stop laughing. we most def have our moments. tiff and i might buy her mini tiny pink one's so that she too can be gangsta.

ohhh and i'm so excited for friday. city trip with the eboard and it's auxiliary members!!! very very happy indeed!

i showed up at the office today at 8:00pm to start care package stuff. earlier erik and i had gone to stop & shop to buy food for the AC meeting and some office supplies. (sidenote: bumped into jordie, justine, paz, and alex... and hamilton stapell... okay had to put that out there...) anyway i put up one of the air freshener thingsy so the room smelled really good. and started doing work. nicole came in and we talked for a little bit. christina and jessie came in a little bit after that and semi mentioned the great state of the office and they all immediately said that it was alexis. tara came in after that and nicole and her talked and then kind of mentioned that maybe arian cleaned it up. once lexie came in they asked her if she had cleaned it herself and alexis said that she hadn't cleaned. they kept talking and then assumed that someone from nrhh had done it or RD Kristen. 

personally i love it because i won't admit to it only because it just goes to show you that sometime the person you least expect to do something will surprise you. eventually i will tell them or maybe not... it's funnier like this though.

other than that i have my paper to write. which i'm off to do now...

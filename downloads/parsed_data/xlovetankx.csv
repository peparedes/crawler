Echos in the distance with the sound of your voice.
Nothing's ever seemed so far away
Wave after wave it's calling me.
Wave after wave after wave."

On the same old loneliness
When breathing just passes the time
Until we all just get old and die
Now talking's just a waste of breath
And living's just a waste of death
And why put a new address
On the same old loneliness"

"event","Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing 
You believed in superstitions 
Then maybe you'd see the signs 

The Lord knows that this world is cruel 
I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool 
Learning lovin' somebody don't make them love you 

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you 
Must I always be playing, playing your fool 

I sang your songs, I danced your dance 
I gave your friends all a chance 
But putting up with them 
Wasn't worth never having you 

Maybe you've been through this before 
But it's my first time so please ignore 
The next few lines cause they're directed at you 

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you 
I can't always be playing, playing your fool 

I keep playing your part 
But it's not my scene 
Want this plot to twist 
I've had enough mystery 
Keep building it up 
Then you shooting me down 
But I'm already down 

Just wait a minute 
Just sitting, waiting 
Just wait a minute 
Just sitting, waiting 

Well, if I was in your position 
I'd put down all my ammunition 
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long 

But the Lord knows that I'm not you 
And if I was, I wouldn't be so cruel 
Cause waitin' on love ain't so easy to do 

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you 
Must I always be playing, playing your fool 

No, I can't I always be waiting, waiting on you 
I can't always be playing, playing your fool"

"event","It's the tearing sound of love-notes
Drowning out the gray stained windows
And the view outside is sterile
And I'm only two cubes down
I'd photocopy all the things that we could be
If you took the time to notice me
But you can't now, I don't blame you
And it's not your fault that no one ever does

But you don't work here anymore
Its just a vacant 3 by 4
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face
This happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

So I'll spend my time with strangers
A condition and it's terminal
In this water-cooler romance
And it's coming to a close
We could be in the park and dancing by a tree
Kicking over blades we see
Or a dark beach with a black view
And pin-pricks in the velvet catch our fall

But you don't work here anymore
Its just a vacant 3 by 4
And they might fill your place
A temporary stand-in for your face
This happens all the time
And I can't help but think I'll die alone

I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore
I know you don't work here anymore

Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, live and breathe and die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, sometimes I think I'll die alone
Sometimes I think I'll die alone, I'd think I'd love to die alone

Just take
I think I'd love to die
Me down
I think I'd love to die
Just take
I think I'd love to die
Me down

I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
I think I'd love to die alone

Live and breathe and die alone
I think I'd love to die alone
i think I'd love to die alone

"event","while doing my paper, ive read a lot of quotes by franz kafka, which i find to be profound and meaningful and deep.  heres some of them that i think you might enjoy, ;)!!!

""Youth is happy because it has the ability to 
see beauty. Anyone who keeps the ability 
to see beauty never grows old.""

""...the innocent and the guilty, both 
executed without distinction in the 
end.... ""

My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication--it makes 
them sociable. I, however, cannot force 
myself to use drugs to cheat on my 
loneliness--it is all that I have--and 
when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, 
will be all that my peers have as well. 

""In the fight between you and the world, back the world.""

	
""The tremendous world I have inside my head. 
But how free myself and free it without being 
torn to pieces. And a thousand times rather be 
torn to pieces than retain it in me or bury it. 
That, indeed, is why I am here, that is quite 
clear to me.""

""Wisdom is thus not what men first of all seek 
They seek, instead, the justification for what 
they happen to cherish.""

""It is the thousandth forgetting of a dream dreamt a thousand times
and forgotten a thousand times, and who can damn us merely for 
forgetting for the thousandth time?""

""a belief is like a guillotine, just as heavy, just as light.""

""If I felt in love, I would be in a world
in which I could not live."""

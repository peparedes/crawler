Abandoned places - I guess we know the score..
On and on!
Does anybody know what we are looking for?

Another hero - another mindless crime.
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime.
Hold the line!
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
Show must go on!
Show must go on!
Inside my heart is breaking,
My make-up may be flaking,
But my smile, still, stays on!

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache - another failed romance.
On and on!
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess i'm learning
I must be warmer now..
I'll soon be turning round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking,
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free!

Show must go on!
Show must go on! Yeah!
Ooh! Inside my heart is breaking!
My make-up may be flaking!
But my smile, still, stays on!
Yeah! oh oh oh

Fairy tales of yesterday, will grow but never die,
I can fly, my friends!

I carry my past with me and it indefinately affects my relationships.  i dont know why im trying to express this becuase i'm not getting across what i want to say, i want to write so that you can feel what i feel. but language is inadequite i wish i could have the an audience composed of everyone who's effected me in such a way that changed me, the good and the bad. i want to explain i want to.... i dont know... i wish understand what has happened, what is to happen. nothing has turned out the way i thought it would, but has it for anyone? but i have come to believe everything happens for a reason, ever path i took every mistake i made, every path i choose has had a reason. i can think things that i just didnt do one thing my life now would be entirely different. i wouldnt be who i am today, i would be as strong as i am today. as much as i hate what i've done. I cant say i regret it, it was all ment to be.  The first thing i've done was forgave myself, and everyone i've effected. i truly am sorry. but this all has happened for a reason. i wish things were different i wish i talked to people that i havent seen in over 5 years. i wish alot of things but i'll let whats going to happen, happen. 



this was a terrible attempt to express what i want to say but its what was on my mind, not totally i havent slept at all. i've been up all night trying to firgure out what i wanted to say but i couldnt and i cant. i must have written this a million times. I forgive you all i dont hate anymore. I hope everyone i've effected can do the same but if not.. then so be it. but i hope everything turned out how everyone
 wanted it...


this isnt really want i wanted to say, or express. but i guess it's a start, its enough for the moment."

I'm more than sure you went COMPLETELY out of your way to ruin Tina and John. and to make matters even more humorous with MY JOURNAL. you can't even use the excuse you were looking for that as a reason to go through this, because you didnt know it was here. and you can't say because i did it to you... because that was over a year ago. my original plan was do something far worse to your account but you didnt really do anything but read this, or comment although im sure you did aloud so whatever read as you like. i still wont read yours, i see absoultely no reason to. so what reason could you have had to read mine? and i wonder what you told Tina and Josh the reason was? im sure it wasnt the real reason."

His tired gaze--from passing endless bars--
has turned into a vacant stare which nothing holds.
To him there seem to be a thousand bars,
and out beyond these bars exists no world.


His supple gait, the smoothness of strong strides
that gently turn in ever smaller circles
perform a dance of strength, centered deep within
a will, stunned, but untamed, indomitable.


But sometimes the curtains of his eyelids part,
the pupils of his eyes dilate as images
of past encounters enter while through his limbs
a tension strains in silence
only to cease to be, to die within his heart."

Although my vacation was definately interesting i started my vacation wicked depressed and figured i'd just drink it away i havent had a sip of alcohol in almost 6 months, i havent been drunk since December. Well i didnt drink my vacation away, nor did i spend it depressed. i spent every single day with my girlfriend and although shes absolutely insane i never got sick of her. Been hanging out with a bunch of old friends, and remembering why i stopped hanging out with some of them. for instance why would i want to see those pictures? and once they were on the screen why asked me if im ""okay?"". what sence does that make? I'm not going to flip out, im not going to get upset. they made me smile because she was happy but it made me sad thing about our past. but thats not the point. the point is if she has this unrational fear of me executing her, him and her bestfriend. why would you show me a picture of him and her?! thats completely disregard for her, and your girlfriends trust. oh well not my concern you can fuck your relationsship up as much as i did mine. but when you fall off that plateau and finally hit rock bottom you'll be where i was almost a year ago. but your pain will be more simple, and more forgiving you couldnt comprehend what i felt or the levels of betrayel i felt i may have been acting melodramatic, i may have been delustional but nonetheless it was real to me. i ment to write this all weeks ago but didnt care enough to. but i dont care.... why the fuck did i get into this, why do i always fucking ramble on about depression and being sad in this fucking journal... why do i even have this fucking journal... oh well... the whole point of the entry is that my vacation was good not great but good. and things are actually going well for me. i've lost 15 pounds last time i checked so i went out and bought $120 worth of food which includes 12 pounds of beef and chicken. my plan is to eat 3 times a day as opposed to the usual 1 and to work out as usual i've built muscle tone but im too skinny. with all the crap i bought i should gain it back rather quickly.

i looked at mt nightstand and it had yellow paint on it, i laughed. which was unusual but i still find it amusing...always such a sloppy painter. im fine now but i still havent tosses my pills away. i've used these benzodiazepines as a shield for far too long. its time to grow up and its time to sober up."

"event","Today was insane i heard of a place called ""Elephant Cave"" or something of the sort... it was a cave.... on this huge hill... anyway, we got to the top and realized how boring it was and how meaningless our trip up this massive hill(which was more like a mountain, seriously it had trails and such... piece of shit was huge)seeing that the cave was on the exact opposite side of the hill/mountain.. but it was at the same elevation we were on. the entire structure was a mountain with 2 giant rock faces pretty high in elevation. about a 10-15 minute walk... but yea so we were on the wrong one.. meaning we would have to hike down to the summit level and climb the other hill... i was like ""fuck that!"". so we decided to desend the hill and at one point we decided to stop for a second. i think tom was sipping his water or something(i wasnt paying attention, i didnt care)...so as we stand there i feel an insect in my hair so i just hit it off me... but it lands again on the same spot. and im still not thinking about it and im like ""what the fuck is this flies problem"". then i felt another one on my right side, and then 2 one my back... then started the stinging... i turned around and saw HUNDREDS (well it seemed so) Yellow Jackets (Hornets that nest underground). so i yell ""hornets!!!!"" and proceed to run down the extremely steep hill towards the street, keeping in mind which has many giant rocks in the way, huge trees, small trees, logs, ditchs, etc... you get the point.... so i end up falling. and then i started to roll but its more like a dive, i ""rolled"" over this little thorn bush thing  and a tree about 8 inches in diameter stopped my fall by lodgeing itself into my stomach(actually very painful). so i get up and keep running meanwhile my friends laughing until he realizes hes COVERED in them too and he starts to freak out (he didnt think i was serious until he saw me dive, and get up and keep running) so he also starts running down the hill... but he had time to think about it. since he saw me tumble down the hill his brain made the connection not to do that so he ran down the main trail... and they followed! (was some seriously scary shit!) we run out of the woods and across the street, throw my backpack to the ground which a yellow jacket is still attempting to sting. i rip my shirt off and theres 1 on that too... and thats when the pain kicked in... you have to keep in mind Yellow jackets (hornets) dont lose their stinger they can keep stinging you until you die, quite literally. because their stingers excrete a poison thats causes <i>Severe pain or/and burning at the site lasts 1 to 2 hours. Normal swelling from venom can increase for 24 hours following the sting. The swelling disappears after 3 to 5 days.</i> the more serious effects of the sting(poison) are: <i>Wheezing or difficulty breathing(respiratory failure), Hoarseness, cough or tightness in the throat or chest ,Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech ,Thinking or speech is confused ,Passed out or very weak ,Previous severe allergic reaction to bees, yellow jackets, etc. (not just hives or swelling) (Note: anaphylaxis usually starts within 20 minutes, and always by 2 hours following a sting.)</i>
 so after saying ""jesus fucking christ it hurts"" like a million times. i look down and realize that i'm completely covered in dirt (obviously from the fall), my right arm is bleeding, both my legs are bleeding. and once again how excruciating painful that fucking sting was, it just kept getting more and more painful and swelled up. Then i remembered that my brother has an allergic reaction to bee stings... meaning that i have a good possiblity of having the allergy also. i then realize if this is true then i'm going to into anaphylactic shock(because my brother does when he is stung and needs to inject himself with his EpiPen (Epinephrine) or he'll die in about 20 minutes... but will fall unconscience in 2 minutes) which is <i>The severest form of allergy which is a medical emergency. A Type I reaction according to the Gell And Coombs Classification . An often severe and sometimes fatal systemic reaction in a susceptible individual upon exposure to a specific antigen (such as wasp venom, hornet, yellow jacket, or penicillin ) following previous sensitization. Characterized especially by respiratory symptoms, fainting, itching, urticaria , swelling of the throat or other mucous membranes and a sudden decline in blood pressure.</i> so if i had it as bad as he does then.. well.... im fucked because im in some weird remote part of melrose. and theres no way i'd be able to get to a hospital in 20 minutes. so i decide to call the melrose city hospital. i do so and i tell them what happened and i tell them about my brother. i then express concern that i may too have the allegy and that i need to know symptoms of an allergic reaction. so she repeatedly informed that she cannot give out such information over the phone, the best she could do was sent an EMT... so i ask her ""what if i am allergic and i wont ask for an EMT because i dont know im allergic because you wont tell me what the symptoms are! then im going to die"", and replys ""well im sorry sir, but i cannot release any medical information or the phone, you can thank your state legislatures""... so then im pretty pissed off... so i head towards oak grove and when i reach it, i look down at my wrist and i realize that my bracelet is missing. and i've had that bracelet on for years and i'm attached to alot of things and my bracelet is one of them... if you dont know what im talking about. when have you ever seen me without my backpack?.... so anyway, i stupidly decide to go back and get it. i was advised by many not to because of the danger of being stung again, the fact i'd be alone this time, and that i still wasnt sure if i was going to go into anaphylactic shock. If i got back into the woods and then the anaphylactic shock occured then...i'd die...but i needed the bracelet back, it had alot of meaning to it, and its become a part of who i am. and im just used to it being on my wrist(and its been there for years, so if i didnt have it anymore it just wouldnt feel right)... so anyway, i make it back to the woods and i slowly walk around looking through the leaves for my lost bracelet but i cant exactly remember where i rolled from. so i just keep walking about and i find the yellow jackets nest... and then abruptly move away from it. i look for the bracelet for what seems to be forever. and then sadly i gave up... as i walked down the trail to leave i see something silver out the corner of my eye. and i look and sure enough its my bracelet. that was indefinately the high point of today because i never thought i would have found that, and i went really close to the nest thinking i dropped it there. and did some really stupid risky shit... but i got it back and on my walk back to oak grove i called a few more people to see if they know about hornet stings and i get alot of good advice. then i deside calling my primary care doctor and talking to him about it because he knows me brother also. so i call and hes not in but they make sure im me through a bunch of random questions and then they tell me what the symptoms are and what to do. so then i was relieved that i didnt have those symptoms although im still poisoned and im going to feel sick for a few days :-\.... yea so then i go home i dont have any of the stuff im suppossed to take and i just washed my cloths and just laid on the ground, and spent alot of time typing this.... fuck i feel HORRIBLE!!! its the  combination of also not sleeping last night :-\... wow today just turned out really bad."

<b>Modest Mouse - The world at large</b>
Ice-age heat wave, can't complain.
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan.
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand.
I move on to another day, to a whole new town with a whole new way.
Went to the porch to have a thought.
Got to the the door and again, I couldn't stop.
You don't know where and you don't know when.
But you still got your words and you got your friends.
Walk along to another day.
Work a little harder, work another way.

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan.
We'll float on maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on maybe would you understand?
Well float on maybe would you understand?

The days get shorter and the nights get cold.
I like the autumn but this place is getting old.
I pack up my belongings and I head to the coast.
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most.
The day's get longer and the nights smell green.
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave.

I like songs about drifters - books about the same.
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane.
Walked on off to another spot.
I still haven't got anywhere that I want.
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights.
Adding their breeze to the summer nights.
Outside, water like air was great.
I didn't know what I had that day.
Walk a little farther to another plan.
You said that you did, but you didn't understand.

I know that starting over is not what life's all about.
But my thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth.
My thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth.
My thoughts were so loud."

"event","Today was the first day of finals... it sucked because i had 3 today and i could have petitioned one to another day but i said fuck it and took all three today just to get it out of the way. its really starting to feel different, i dont have to stay in the building, i dont have to goto homeroom, i dont need passes, i dont need anything, im barely considered a student anymore.. i come in when the final starts and leave when im finished... thats it, and i only have to come back when the next final is... 

    Tonight is when the partys start!!! well not the big insane ones, the small get together ones.. ahh well its all good. Johns parents are gone for the weekend, and now that schools out... on comes the alcohol, and potheads smoking in the other room and me once again saying ""nah, i dont smoke"" like everytime i goto one of these but it should prove to feel the same as it did back in the day (two summers ago) but the only down side is, im still a violent drunk... well sometimes i am it soley depends on what mood im in when i start and what the environment is. i never used to be as violent as i've become, i guess last summer (when it started) i had alot of hate for everyone and myself. and when im drunk some of it still comes out.. i dont know why thoough. i guess its all been bottled up and i release it on the wrong people.. :-\ even though i dont feel angry to anyone anymore.. although i've made alot of mistakes and have alot of enemies now. ah well doesnt matter to me.. but as my fortune cookie said a week ago ""No man is without enemies""... one also said ""Joy often lines the shadows of sorrow""... *shurgs* ahh well still doesnt matter. i feel good and tonight im going to Johns so im going to be one jovial individual... either that or that annoying over affectionate loser i sometimes act like... im extremly bored and this entry doesnt really have any relevance but oh well... commment as you will.. i dont care *Shurgs*"

"event","Things have been really up and down lately... but im gald everythings coming to an end... but i wont be sure ill be happy with the end results of all this... the way i've been feeling is a very complicated mix of emotions... maybe its because of all my clear thought, i remember the times were i had other things take care of my feelings other than working them out in my mind, finding rational reasoning in irrational circumstances, and situations. confronting my feelings dead on. seeing the consequences WAY in advance and forcing myself to move forward. fuck i've changed so much! im so much better now, and have been for so long now. im sure that some people who are reading this are making rash opinions about what exactly im talking about. but if you dont know, or you only THINK you know.(for example you dont know my past, or me well) so dont try and comment think you know what my 'problem' was. im just reflecting on how much i face things differently. im only posting this because i feel like talking about, i dont want an opinion. i just cant believe how much stronger i am now, and how everything worked out. this was all sparked by this complete bullshit assembly yesterday at school about the ""dangers"" of drugs. yea drugs are bad, just word 'drug' strikes fear into the hearts of the ignorant. like im on DRUGS right now...i bet you just stopped in shock well i just took acetaminophen!! the brand name for this drug is TYLENOL!! but its a drug, that CAN kill you if used IMPROPERLY. but in moderation relieves mild pain, ANY drug can be used IMPROPERLY not only street drugs and a large assortment of pharmacutical drugs, that have some form of recreational value. but all drugs are one in the same. some drugs you buy OTC (over the counter) are more dangerous than shit you find on the street. no im not saying go out and buy some heroin for your backache, and fuck the asprin. but drugs are safe as long as the USER isnt IGNORANT to the fact that it has an addictive nature (if thats the case), or that you can overdose of it, but you can overdose anything. you may all heard of the massively evil satanic drug called 'OxyContin'...? hmm ""evil"" ""satanic"" i think not, OxyContin does contain a very amount of the opioid antagonist known as Oxycodone (meaning narcotic - to my lay audience. but OxyContin makes hundreds of lives worth living not only medically to the patients how suffer from cancer treatment (some of which who are in so much pain they ask there doctors to kill them, remember doctor kevorkian. thats who asked him) and without OxyContin, these people are in so much pain they cant bare to live! wheres the evil in that! and for street use OxyContin does kill the ignorant. if you dont know what exactly its doing to you, dont guess the dosage or mix it with a benzodiazepine. they are both CNS depressants in one form or another so dont be stupid. Addiction to OxyContin or any other drug with an addictive nature doesnt only happen to people who abuse the drug it also happens to everyone who uses the drug. all thats needed is knowledge and MODERATE use of the drug. yes drugs can be deemed 'bad' when used recreationally but some people NEED to feel happy for alittle while, and maybe that few weeks they drug themselves but isnt that better than them killing themselves? i think so, i dont think recreational drug use is bad in moderation. if you sometime need to be happy, and we all do. than what does a few Percocets here or there hurt. NOONE!! its a victimless crime, as long as you know what your taking, how much to take, and what exactly its going to do your fine. dont confuse what im saying though. im NOT saying go out and do drugs, im mearly saying dont be fast to pass judgement on someone whos using a drug to cope with something, as long as its not excessive its going to be fine. im also NOT saying to USE drugs to cope, im just saying if its at the point of despair who the fuck does it hurt. i hate how everyone seems to thing that drugs are satan, and go home and take there Prozac(althought not recreational, is a SSRI(Selective Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitor) which helps regulate your seratonin level(Happy feeling juice - to lay audience) in your brain) which is also a drug which keeps you happy by releasing seratonin but so do narcotics(Opium, Heroin, OxyContin, Percocet Vicodin etc...), and amphetamines(Adderall, Ritalin, Speed, Meth)! its just what dosage your taking it keep it at a SAFE level but teaching people to FEAR rather that to EDUCATE, makes the few who do try them at RISK since they dont know what to do, and end up overdosing or becoming addicted... i dont know where i left off but oh well i feel satisfied with the ground i've covered... oh and for the record (since i know stupid people are going to think stupid things due to the way our soceity has made them think of drugs) just because i do not condemn these drugs DOES NOT mean i use these drugs!!! just get that straight!! i hope i've been able to help someone see somewhat of what i think and maybe free people from our soceitys depiction of drugs..."

so i guess i'll start with today, Today sucked! it was one of the most meaningless days i've had in a long time :-first off was the first day of MCAS testing which means that school starts at 10:45 instead of the usual 7:75 :-D. but since we had Block 1 first that ment that i ment straight to lunch right after homeroom, then the rest of the day was periods 5, and 7. which i had studies for both :-i only had an actual one hour of school today and that one hour was me sitting in my boring Art class with my ugly painting that the art teachers assured my was ""beautiful"". i hate how teachers always have to be so positive and have to ""try"" to make you feel like your doing well even when you put forth no effort and they say that your doing good when you know its all crap cuz you didnt care in the slightest and your positive that its absolutely sucks...so after the meaningless 3-1/2 hours i spent doing nothing. i got to see Kitty :-D, which made the day exponentally better. but she was going to a David Bowie concert tonight so i didnt get to see her for that long. After on the walk home,  i waited at the bus stop with John for his bus then went home and got into a fight with my parents (as usual) but oh well im moving out next month so it doesnt really matter anymore.... that preeeety much it....so overall today sucked...and now im tired from writing all that meaningless crap about my day.. so goodnight"

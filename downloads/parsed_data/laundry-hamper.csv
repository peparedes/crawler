I finally understand the lament of students everywhere - the inability to afford lunch.  And like the others, it's my fault.  Unlike them, I haven't been drinking a pool's worth of beer (to my slight dismay).

Cast your mind back to <a href=""http://laundry-hamper.livejournal.com/12019.html"">this time last year</a>.  Well despite a brief reprieve, the company is once again dropping the game.  Only this time it can't be picked up again because they're not renewing the license.  I've been setting up trades on other forums and scouring ebay again, and picking up some bitchin' deals (one guy is selling about 5 fleets at half price.  HALF PRICE!!).  The consequence of that is a severe lack of cash.  On the bright side, the trades are getting rid of a lot of crap lying around that I haven't been using.  Anyway, more on the whole thing <a href=""http://eek107.blogspot.com/2009/03/other-projects-babylon-5.html"">here</a>.

In other news, it's the easter holidays!  Officially I have three weeks of bumming around, gaming and drinking.  In reality, I only get this week as I have too many courseworks to finish.  But despite that, there was no way I was going to go in on the first week of the holidays.  Wild freakin' horses couldn't have dragged me there.

Finally, over the last few months since writing that first one, I did make a few more little comic strips.  Tell me what you think!

TELL ME NAO BITCHES!!

(Making a comic means I'm entitled to all-caps.  Seriously, how many webcomic authors do it?  Quite a lot huh?)

Seriously though, is it good?  I got tonnes of ideas kinda like this, so I might make something of 'em if they're good.
Also, anyone wanting to be a supporting character to me, or make a cameo, gimme a shout. :)"

As promised, a more in-depth look at my swesome trip to Devon.  It was a 12 hour car journey starting at 1am... not fun, but it was worth it.  Some of the service stops were pretty rough-looking though.  We actually skipped a few because we didn't like the look of the folk that were there.

Anyway, we eventually got there, and stayed at a holiday cottage in Woolsery (a small village, that'sthe short verson of its name).  3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms... quite a nice place.  The village had a pub, but I never really fancied going.  The house was right next to a graveyard... I ain't one for all that ghosty nonsense but it was still kinda creepy.

Devon's a pretty nice place, I have to admit.  Really warm and sunny, and really really green.  Here it's kinda brown and green, but down there it's all green, the countryside's beautiful.  I actually wouldn't mind living there someday.  The really hot accent helps. :P

All sorts of good sights to see... local towns and such.  The highlight has to be the Eden Project in Cornwall, a couple of hours from where we stayed.  Basically just two massive dome-shaped greenhouses, one with a Medeterranian theme, one all rainforest-ish.  Too much to describe, but luckily dad took the camera and we got <a href=""http://s14.photobucket.com/albums/a321/eek_107/Devon%2008/"">a whole bunch of photos</a>.  There's even a couple of me in there with my new long hair, you luckly little sods. ;)

Most nights were spent eating out at country pubs, or eating in and playing No More Heroes.  Which is a fantastic game, I might add.  That and Pokemon Silver, I developed a bit of an addiction to that just before leaving.  But it did help keep me sane on those long car journeys.

Right, now to more recent stuff... which there ain't much of tbh.  All I can think of is that I'm kinda half thinking of maybe doing a bit of the webcomic thing.  I've got about half a dozen strips pencilled out, going for a sort of gag-a-day observational thing, I guess it would be mostly gaming related since that's what I am first and foremost, with a bit of ""life through my eyes"" mixed in.  I wouldn't kick it off without enough backup strips to cover any writer's block, so I'm still building that up.  Might post a couple in my next entry or DA after tidying them up a bit.  I've got 2 BF2142 related strips since I've played that recently, a couple on student life (based on true events), and a few other general ideas floating around.  I think what's got me thinking about it is the fact that my graphics lecturer has a comic (Cascade Failure, check it out at comicgenesis, it's pretty good).  He just finished the course I'm on a few years ago, so there's quite a bit about it in there in his... I guess semi-autobiographical arc (a lot of his strips are based almost exactly on real events), as well as a WoW arc and general gags.

Oh, went to a wargames show in Edinburgh on Saturday.  It was a pretty good day out.  Being a member of a club gave me free admission... the downside being having to set up our table and spend a couple of hours gaming there.  We were playing a game called ""Rapid Fire!"", which is a WW2 historical game.  Sadly, it didn't live up to it's name and was horrendously slow and clunky, especially with regard to shooting.  But luckily I managed to sneak off to do some browsing, spending and eating, and by the time I got back a couple of non-club members had taken up the game with one of the guys at the club overseeing it, so I kinda skived the rest.
In my browsing I spent most of my time at the Urban Mammoth stand.  They're an Edinburgh-based company that makes a game called Urban War.  I'd heard of it before, but they'd brought some of their studio minis along to display and they're freaking gorgeous.  So I splashed out most of my cash on the game, keep an eye on my DA for what I got.  I chose the Viridians because they just look so kickass, especially the snipers (I got 6 of those :D ).  My bro and his friend also bought some UW stuff, and a couple of folks at the club play already, so it's looking good.

Final note, both asmallbluedot and skexyjedi were spot on, Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is freaking awesome.  WATCH IT!!  I've only seen parts 1 and 2, so no spoilers plz!

Title's from the film Unbreakable... I swear I laughed when she said that line to her son.

Take care."

Just recovered from the big 21st celebration I had yesterday.  Well, I say recovered, I still don't think I'm quite that far yet.

Pretty good night.  One of my mates cycled out, I picked the other up, and between us we'd brought 40 odd beers!  Don't worry, there's still some left.  So it was beer & Wii all night, up til like, 4am I think.  Then we came down here and essed about on the PC for a bit before going back up to pass out for the rest of the morning.

The gaming was good.  My bro got Brawl just that morning (YES!!), which is awesome, so we played that for a bit.  Then we played some Wii Sports, Warioware and Resi Evil 4, all good fun.

Not all good though.  I spent quite a lot of time in the morning throwing up until I was empty, and then some.  I can only remember counting as far as 6 beers, but apparently I went as far as 8.  And I stop walking straight after 2 so... yeah...  Hangover lasted for about 18 hours or so, and my stomach's still a little on edge even now.
I've pretty much forgotten half the night.  Random fragments here and there... and I keep getting mixed up when the bits I do remember actually happened.

Overall it was good though.  At least I can say I celebrated my 21st in the traditional way, which makes up for the slightly disappointing 18th.

Take care! :)"

What a month!  Okay, not really all that much happened.  I passed my driving test (WOOHOO!! third time lucky!), I became broke twice (not so woohoo) and... uh... that's pretty much all there is to it.
So yeah, all I need is insurance and I can hit the roads.  Of course, I needn't go into detail about the cost of insuring a 20 year old male driver just after passing his test.

What else?  Well I'm still trying to get my head 'round modding HW2.  I've... uh... got my hands on a full version of Maya, god knows if it'll actually install.  My Milkshape trial ran out, so I'll reinstall that.  But I've managed to at least model a couple of fighters... which I'm re-doing because the poly count is too high.

And on a related note, I can finally say I've watched everything Babylon 5.  The main series, Crusade, and ALL the movies.  I even put myself through Legend Of The Rangers.  What am I going to do now?  Watch it all again, of course. :P
Oh, and I FINALLY watched Children of Men.  Bloody awesome.  Especially the fight in that city at the end... fantastic stuff.

And I can't think of anything else.  So leave me teh comentz!"

"event","Well, I'm here with a beer again, so I'm feeling talkative.  And with nobody else in the room, and all the forums/IMs quiet, I turn to LJ.

I guess the main thing to say would be that I've made the first few steps on that Morrowind TC I mentioned a while back.  I have the Vvardenfell landscape at 1.5x the original dimensions (which works out at 2.25x the area), all fully textured thanks to Lightwave's tesannwyn utility.  So I've chucked in a very rough chargen script and a little of Seyda Neen... just the Census office exterior and bare bones Prison Ship.  I'd upload it, but it comes in at over 120mb.  I've had a few additional ideas, such as continuing play beyond the timeframe in the original game... perhaps surrounding the Daedric invasion at the same time as the events in Oblivion.  Obviously this would require a new character (since good ol' Nerevarine leaves for Akavir), so that would mean a separate mod.  Which means I have to put in all the buildings and stuff to create the actual Vvardenfell world as a resource which I can then base a few plugins from.
Of course, I know I'll never actually finish any of this at all, but I like time-wasting. :P

In other news, I've used my glasses for reading the forums tonight, and it made things a hella lot better.  They make the bridge of my nose feel all funny, but that's something I'll have to get used to I suppose.

That's it I think..."

"event","Well, here it is folks, another long overdue update on Link:

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a321/eek_107/Zelda/Minis/04-front.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a><a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a321/eek_107/Zelda/Minis/04-normal.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a><a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a321/eek_107/Zelda/Minis/04-rear.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

And since I can't be arsed typing it all out again, I'll just copy and paste from PROTESF:

Observant viewers may notice I've given him the Mirror Shield and gauntlets rather than what he has in the reference picture. I figured it would look better with them.
The bow is proving to be a bit of a nightmare, and I'm not entirely happy about it, but I'll get there in the end. I've stuck it back on squint (after an accident) and it's a little rougher than I'd like, so I'll need to attend to those. On top of that, I've failed several times with the hilt of the sword (which is supposed to stick up above the shield), so I'll be covering most that area with his hat... *shifty eyes*

In other news, it's three weeks until my next driving lesson, since my instructor's off for a week.  He reckons I'll be through my test in Septemer, which is great!  It means I won't have to juggle Uni and lessons, provided I pass, of course.

And I'm in a bit of a sticky situation regarding the fairer sex.  I have two crushes, neither of which will really have much interest in me by the looks of things.  One, who I mentioned last time, has just broken up with her boyfriend, and I sure as hell ain't gonna just dive in there and snatch her while she's vulnerable.  I may be desperate, but I have morals.  The other lives miles and miles away, and seems a bit more compatible, but is very very slightly less attractive.  Plus, I hardly know her.  Ah, it's a waiting game either way, but I'm falling for both and I don't know which I'd pick, IF I even have to (which I doubt will ever happen).

Ah... bugger..."

"event","Well, ain't this been an interesting weekend?  Apparently so in sunny (*cough*) Scotland.

My parents are finally back from holiday, which means freedom from my drunken grandmother.  She's hellish company once she gets into the wine, but I don't want to rant, it'll just bring me down from my emotional high right now.

Something almost as important, is the fact I've made amends with a very nice girl I (regrettably) fell out with last year.  It was a mad thought, brought on by repeatedly dreaming about her, so I got tanked up on beer and emailed.  Suffice to say, we're friends again.  Will it go further?  I'd like to think so.  We're both different now, so I wonder how we'll interact.  Either way, I won't jeapordise our friendship again.  If it don't go down that route, I'll just accept it instead of acting like a desperate lovestruck teenager (which, I have to admit, I was back then).

Link's making slow but steady progress, despite me having to re-do the shield and bow.  More pics over the next couple of days, hopefully.

So this is a very happy eek finishing off this entry.  Take care everyone."

"event","Hello again everyone.  Well, I say everyone, but I really have no idea if anyone's really reading this.  Anyway...

There seems to be a distinct lack of in-depth information regarding Ocarina Of Time on the internets.  Sure, we have our FAQs and our walkthroughs and our glitches, but in terms of lore, it doesn't go far beyond Link, Ganon, Zelda and the Sages.  None of the random villagers get much of a mention, and I've yet to see a good picture of any of them.

So, I've decided to do it myself.  I've scrapped my old Freewebs setup and I'm using it for this project until I can make something more sophisticated.  Unfortunately, since I lack a camera until Monday, I can't get the screenshots I want but Muad'Dib/Newbiezilla from PROTESF has kindly volunteered to help me with that until I can take my own, for which I am very grateful.

My grandmother is proving to be hellish company, and that's before she gets drunk and aggressive.  Ah well, such is life.

On a lighter note, I've managed to buy three replacement controllers and a memory card for my N64 off of ebay as well as three new rumble packs, and tomorrow I'll hopefully get a fourth controller.

That's about all for now, take care everyone."

Also, I've started work on three new Zelda sculpts based on the following:

(a Hylian Guard, a Gerudo Guard, and a Leever, respectively).  I've got the armatures posed for the first two, and a basic blob prepared for the Leever.  I should be able to get more pictures on Monday at the earliest.

And finally, I'm working on my website again, so I hope to have something fit for viewing within the next few days.

Take care, everyone."

"event","Hello again everyone!

There won't be any pictures of Link for about a week.  My parents have gone on holiday and taken the camera with them, so it's a bit out of reach.  I've done a bit of work on his sword, bow and gauntlets, but not enough to take another set of pics anyway.

As I said, my parents are away, and it's my grandparents that are looking after us.  Woo-bloody-hoo.  Hear the sarcasm?  Good.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love 'em to bits, but they just ain't my parents, so they don't quite know how stuff works here.  Routines will be all messed up and they'll not be giving me quite the same peace, quiet and privacy as my parents do.  Well, to be fair, grandad does, but gran doesn't.  So I'll be seeking solace both from the internets and my trusty Zelda games.  Speaking of which, Wind Waker is getting there.  I just need to find the Triforce pieces then kick Ganon's ass.  OH YEAH!!

In other news, my driving test which I should have had this morning was rescheduled for 8pm thursday.  Woohoo, more sleep!  Oh, and my theory test is on Wednesday, so wish me luck!

I think that about wraps it up for now.  Take care."

"event","Yep, good ol' eek's got himself an LJ.  I've been meaning to for a while, and I guess now is as good a time to start as any.  I'll probably be tackling my gaming progress and other projects, and random thoughts and such too.  Ain't that worth reading, eh?

Well, I guess I'll start with Zelda, as that's been absorbing my life once again.  Some of you will have recognized the first lines of Ocarina Of Time in the title.  How could I pick any other?  I love that game to bits.  I beat Ganon this weekend, but as always, there's all manner of secrets and items to find.  On top of that, I've started The Wind Waker and Oracle Of Ages again.  Who knows how many games I'll get done before I overload on Zelda and burn out?  Only time will tell.  One thing is certain, and that's the fact that it'll be fun all the way.

Somewhat related is my second-best hobby, that of wargaming (one that few folks know of).  I'm more into the artistic side, which involves painting mostly.  I'm doing well with that, so I'm trying my hand at sculpting my own stuff.  I've done a little of that before, just tidying up small areas of minis after arm swaps and such.  Not a full-blown sculpt like what I'm on now.  Here's how I'm doing (note the armature I'm using as a base)
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a321/eek_107/Zelda/Minis/02-back.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a><a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a321/eek_107/Zelda/Minis/02-front.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

That last one is what I'm hoping to make out of this.  Right now it's just fleshing him out, filling in rough details and the like.  Anyway, feedback is most welcome.

Don't think there's much else for me to say for now.  I'll update when I do, can't say when that will be.  Take care."

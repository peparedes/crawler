Caesar, your time with me was short.
But in those few hours you became a good friend to me.
A good pet.
I pray that your death was painless.
I pray that you forgive my carelessness.

I hope you heard my prayer.
Caesar, I am glad that at least you died in decency
And not in that nasty thing the Wal-Mart had you in.
Caesar, I love you
And I am sorry that
I didn't read the instructions right."

""Hoopla's forces made progress into our borders, but they were never actually breached,"" said Ben Dover, military spokesman for the Norturnian Military.""Our forces, on the other hand, entered, breached, and ravaged their borders.""

Once the borders were secured, Norturnian forces surrounded and sieged Artilleria's capital. Hoopla personally led the defense of the city, but his attempts to force Norturnian forces into withdrawl failed.

""Our forces were hours away from victory.

""However, its leader finally came to senses and begged for a ceasefire.""

Norturnian officials debated and considered the ceasefire for several hours, and after serious deliberation decided to accept Hoopla's deal. 

Hoopla and Ivan met at the Isukalat Imperial Palace and drafted a ceasefire treaty. In the treaty, Hoopla guaranteed that Norturne would never be invaded again. Signed and dated, the ceasefire ended 17 hours of warfare.

"event","Kislav, Norturne - The Press Conference hosting the leaders of Norturne and Immoral America, Ivan Ramirez and Herr Clinton (respectively), was interrupted by sudden blasts. Seconds after the initial explosions the Kislav raid alarms began blasting throughout the Norturnian capital and an emergency broadcast was aired on Norturnian national television informing citizens that the capital was under attack.

The two leaders of the formerly-warring nations exchanged puzzled looks before being rushed out of the press conference room by the Norturnian Secret Service. 

The Norturnian was leader was allegedly heard asking a Secret Service agent ""what the hell is going on?""

An emergency announcement was then made throughout the Kislavic Palace ordering visitors to ""follow the red lights on the floor"" and to ""proceed calmly to the Palace bunker.""

The Norturnian military was quickly mobilized and the national DEFCON level was switched to level 1. The  invading force was then located and confronted. A total of two invading waves were reported, and thanks to quick action by the Norturnian military both waves were repelled. 

About an hour later the NIA (Norturnian Intelligence Agency)intercepted a radio signal from its western neighbor, Artilleria. According the NIA, the signal was broadcasting military orders against Norturne. The NIA had stumbled upon the smoking gun.

A profile on the Artilleria leader was then compunded by the NIA. NIA top officials then released a television broadcast made by the Artilleria leader, Hoopla, two days ago in which he bickered putrid propaganda on expansion.

(Hoopla shown here babbling expansion propaganda)

The NIA believes that the unprovoked attack on Norturne by its neighbor was motivated by Hoopla's expansion ambitions.

Shown in this satallite image, Artilleria and Norturne are on a expansion collision course.

With this revelation, the NIA believes that Hoopla has no intention of backing down and seeks the destruction of Norturne."

"event","Kislav, Norturne - 3 days of bloody warfare end today during the early morning as the leaders of Norturne and Immoral America signed a ceasefire at approximately 3:40 am (PST). 

The ceasefire came after 8 hours of negotiations between the two leaders, ending a conflict that cost approximately 130 lives and about $800 in damage, and leaving the two nations at a critical economic stage. 

When asked at a press conference why Immoral America finally entered into negotiations with Norturne, Herr Clinton responded by saying that ""There's a huge war going on and there's no need for us [Norturne and Immoral America] to fight.""

Kislav, Norturne - Immoral America forces swarmed the Norturnian capital for the first time and smashed into the Norturnian defense force's main strongholds on Friday, 10:48 (PST), killing at least 12 Norturnian soldiers. Their first offensive against Norturne, however, was a disastrous failure as Immoral America lost 20 soldiers and about  $700 in abandoned equipment. The deadly barrage came as a result of recent Norturnian aggression towards its closet neighbor, which has claimed approximately 102 lives.

Norturnian government officials responded by enacting martial law and citizens were warned that another possible attack could be underway.

Seconds later after the martial law announcement was made a blast was heard on the outskirts of Kislav, and the Norturnian army was thrown into full alert. Three more blasts followed and soldiers armed and dressed in the Immoral America military attire were seen charging through the smoke. Norturnian forces opened fire at the incoming Immoral American horde, but were overwhelmed by superior firepower and greater numbers. The second attack left 23 Norturnian and 9 Immoral American soldiers dead, a total of .176 infrastructure destroyed, and ver .045 miles of Norturnian soil was razed, making this a successful Immoral American offensive against Norturne.

The Norturnian government, desperate to react, quickly collected taxes and built up and offensive force. Hours later Norturnian soldiers marched into the Immoral American capital, Sin City, but were met with a force greater in numbers. Citizens, furious with their government's inadequate response, rioted throughout the nation, and the Norturnian government was thrown into anarchy.

Realizing that the Norturne government is at a critical stage, Grand Chancellor Ivan Ramirez contacted the President of the Grand Global Alliance (the alliance the Norturne government is a member of) and pleaded for aid. The response, however, was unfavorable, the Grand Global Alliance stating that Norturne should seek a peace resolution first before pleading for any aid.

Frustrated by this response, the Chancellor then contacted Sakurazuka of ZombieLand and pleaded for her assistance in the conflict.  An official response by the ZombieLand government has yet to be issued.

Meanwhile, the Norturnian government is indeed seeking a peace resolution as the GGA suggested, but communication between the leaders of the warring nations is slow.

My citizens didnt like it at first; they got mad; and my income went down.
They got happy when I won a battle > my income went up a bit.
I decided to give into their demands for a transitional government and judaism as the national religion >> They got ""Really"" happy, and my income is where it was before the war.

He's also getting married!

"event","Interesting day today at school. It all started after school....

Well, the bus got there late. I'd say about 15 minutes late. That alone made me angry. Okay, so i get in the bus, take my seat and wait for it to get going. That's when I notice a black student going up to the bus driver and asking her if she could wait 5 minutes, that he was going to go get something quick. The black male rushes out of the bus and leaves his belongings behind.

15-20 minutes later: I'm pissed.

The whole bus was a bit dissatisfied about being held up; but no one was as pissed as me. I did not like the fact that I was being held back for someone else's sake. My brother kept telling me to relax, but I snapped eventually. I put my things down and stood up;

""Excuse me,"" I called to the bus driver, ""Are you telling me that you're willing to delay over 50 students for the sake of ONE student?""

The bus driver looks at me through the mirror and responds, ""Yea, I am. What if that was you?  Wouldn't you want us to wait?""

I snapped at her, ""To be quite honest with you, no. I'd expect the bus to leave without me. To hold back 50 students for the sake of one student is not only foolish, but selfish...""

The driver cuts me off and yells at me to sit down.

""I shall not sit down,"" I said firmly, ""This bus runs on a schedule. There is a arrival time and then there's a departure time. Everyone knows buses run on schedule, and that young man is putting us behind schedule. Let me ask you, how often have you heard of a city bus holding up everyone else for the sake of one patron?"" I was very eloquent. I felt my heart pounded against my chest in a quick beat as excitement took over and adrenaline rushed through me. I was taking a position i've never taken before; I was speaking for others.

The bus driver stammers, ""I said sit down! You have two choices: You either sit down and ride the bus, or get out and call home.""

""Oh really?"" I said mockingly. ""Then that young man has the same choices!"" My voice got louder and passionate as I directed my point with my hands ""He can either SIT DOWN and RIDE THE BUS, or he can GET OUT AND CALL HOME,"" I said,  putting emphasis on certain words to make my point.

The other riders roared in excitement at the show I was putting. It got so loud in there that the driver had to use the intercom to continue talking with me. ""Sit down or I'll call security.""

""Call them!"" I yelled back at her. ""I'm already late.""

I see her talking on the radio to someone. Probably security, I think to myself but not caring. After a few more minutes the bus driver looks back at me from the mirror, ""Fine, you're right."" She tells me, ""Get his stuff and hand it over to security.""

""Gladly,"" I tell her. I get up and move towards the back of the bus towards  the kid I saw the black male hand over his stuff too;  another black male. 

""Please give me his stuff,"" I ask politely. 

""I'm not giving you shit."" He barks savagely while his other friend mocks me like a child.

""Whoa, congratulations,"" I look at the one that is mocking me and glare at him, ""Really, congratulations, thank you for insulting me like a pathetic six year old.""

I laugh and turn around to look at the rest of the riders. ""Don't any of you fools want to go home?!"" I cry. ""Are we going to allow these two hold us back from going home!? Don't any of you want to go home?! Stand up, stand up! Those who want to go home stand up!"" To my surprise, a few of them actually stand. They were actually listening.

I look back at the black student who had refused to hand over the belongings, and I turn around knowing I had no legitimate authority to take the student's belongings. The bus driver, however, does. I tell the bus driver that students are refusing to hand over the belongings of the slacker. She goes to the back and comes back to the front with his stuff. She hands it over to me and tells me security is waiting outside for it behind the bus. I grab it and rush out of the bus, eager to get the fuck out of there. About a minute later I'm back at the bus; that's when the slacker comes back. I groan in frustration as he spends another minute retrieving his belongings from the guard, but i'm happy that i'll finally be going home to Melanie.

I can hear the black students talking about me in the back, but I don't care, I'm going home.

Now, my stop is the first one, and I know these black kids don't get off here and they never move to the front. But for some reason one of them decides to move to the front this day. I reach for my things and stand up. As I stand up my eyes make contact with a black student who is staring me down. 

A little something in me is furious and I feel it take over.

""Do you have something to say to me?"" I growl at him, staring right back into those yellow eyes.

He cusses at me, I couldn't make it out; the anger has impaired me. I hear the word bitch and fag, and  that's enough to set me off.

""Listen to me you insignificant little speck!"" I yell, taking large steps towards him as I extended my arm out in a defensive position while pointing my finger right on his face in an intimidating manner, holding my AP Europen History Prep book in my other hand tightly as I watched his moves from behind my eye-glasses. ""I am not about to take anything from you, especially today! I am in no mood to deal with the likes of you today!""

He tries to talk back, but I raise my voice and continue to take steps towards him, only to have him back away from me. ""Shut your mouth now, you uncivilized dolt, you beastly savage! Don't you dare look at me like that ever again or I will strike you down, I am not afraid of you or those other savages behind me! I suggest you either hit me now or you get the fuck out of my way right now!"" Notice this is  the first and only time I use profanity.

He looks at me and I can see the fear in his eyes. ""Get out of my way now! NOW!"" I demand, another rush running up my spine. The black male steps inside a seat area and makes way for me. I take a step forward and turn to look at him one more time; the whole bus laughing at him at this point. As I exit the bus I apologize to the bus driver for any disrespect and jump out.

I watch the bus pull of and drive away. I stare at the dark cloud of smog it leaves behind. My brother comes up from behind and laughs. ""You're nuts."" He tells me. 

I laugh, in spite of myself, and shake my head. ""Hey, I lost my patience, ok?"" 
A girl comes up to me and taps my shoulder. ""Wow, you were great. I wish I could have said  all that because that's exactly what I felt."" 

I smile and thank her for her compliment. ""No, really,"" she goes on ""You're my hero. I love you.""

x.x I thank her again and turn to my brother. He's still laughing and calling me a crazy bastard. 

""Well,"" I tell them with a smile, ""let's not just stand here like idiots wasting time. Let's go home."""

In class they avoid making eye contact. 

They avoid verbal confrontations. 

In most cases, people prefer to ignore me then talk things out; I'll prove them wrong one way or another; i have my way with words. 



Hmmm... 



The pen truly is mightier than the sword. 


I'm becoming what I always dreamed of. 

It's amazing how much my skills have developed... 


The pen truly is mightier than the sword. 


However, as I continue to progress new challenges arise. 


My number one challenge is emotion. 


I had it conquered. 


But foolish me softened up. 


The pen truly is mightier than the sword. 


Oh but not all was lost! Of that I can assure you. 

I can switch back at my own discretion. 


Oh yes, perhaps it wasn't all in vain... 


I have the ability, no, the power to control it now. 


Why I choose not to go back into the abyss is a different matter.&nbsp;

Pens run out of ink.
And metal eventually rusts away...

Nothing will be mightier than my legacy."

Music should reflect what's really inside the subject's soul; and if you have a repulsive soul then your music should be repulsive. 

For example, I'm a Fascist. You'll never catch me crunking to ""Imagine"" (although i've listened to it once, but you'll never catch me listening to it alone as a source of pleasure.) 

Stop being a hypocrite.
Show the world your true, disgusting self.

Enough said. I'm pissed.

Fag

Jerk

The list grows larger everyday.

Why am I called a fag? Why am I called an asshole?

Because I smirk at the ignorance of others.

Because I scoff when people say Russia faught France in WWI

Because I groan at the impudent and grotesque behavior subjects display in public.

Because I'm not afraid of calling subjects manipulative sycophants when credit is due.

Oh yes, I may be pompous, flamboyant and a grandiloquent, but I assure you that I am no asshole, nor a jerk, nor a fag, nor any other banal term associated with the display of rude behavior.

"event","I find myself in relaxing moods sometimes. I call those my writing moods. I don't have those that often, although lately I have (which explains the constant journal entries).

My mind is inspired by words. I take a word, analyze it, and write about it. But...this time i've decided to use a person instead, because I've noticed that I don't ever write about people. Tonight I shall write about my dear love, Melanie.

I am intrigued by the different ways Melanie makes me feel. There's always a different emotion when I talk with Melanie. It can either be excessive love, admiration, frustration, and many more...

Melanie...

There are times when she makes me feel like a child. This is usually when she's angry (she makes the most sense when she's angry, I've come to learn) and makes a lot sense, making me seem like an irrational being.

Then there are times when she makes me feel really frustrated. This is because I want her to trust me and confide in me. She says it's not an issue of trust, and I believe her. I should stop pushing her too fast. Take your time, beloved duckling. Take all the time you need.

When I make her sad I feel disgusted with myself. Disgusted because I know i've done it on purpose as a way to get back at her for something she did. But that's wrong, and Melanie I apologize. Forgive me, dearest Melanie. I promise I won't break you again. I promise not to treat you like the enemy ever again. You have my word.


Heh, how I love that happy girl's laughter. Melanie, you're a spring of the purest water. To look at you is to drink, drink, and drink.

Hah! I have never told her before, but I have a special image of her. She's in a field of flowers, it is bright and sunny, and the sky is clear and blue. She's running, and she's happy. I can hear her laughing as she plays with that damn dog of hers. Heh.

Little duckling. I feel the greatest when you're happy. Your happiness and laughter brings me joy. I love you, my precious Melanie. I won't ever love anyone the way I love you. Let me make you happy. Let me be a part of your life and that happiness.

You've been a complicated one, Melanie. It was difficult winning your friendship, and even more difficult winning your heart. But now that I have both I'm going to make sure I don't lose them.

I won't let you down.

Thanks to her I'm finally beginning to see the rainbow."

No more grudges, I say. It's time to behave like the rational beings we're capable of being. It is time to forgive. It is time to set aside grudges and learn to listen, understand, and accept.

Let go of the nasty feelings.
Embrace the good ones.

"event","It's amazing how human beings allow themselves to be manipulated by feelings and emotions; forces that have no significant physical characteristics; or perhaps they do and modern science cannot identify the physical matter. Regardless of the lack of physical matter, emotions are powerful forces and even tools that drive the human race through various mental stages. For example, we have the star struck lover; an obsessive if not infatuated lover. Then we have the romantic; a subject who changes drastically, perhaps from a rebellious youth to a modest member of society. Somewhere in the bundle we have the mad-lover; a pitiful subject driven to his/her very essence in such a way as to ignite the fury and savagery implanted deep within the abyss of the so called heart.

Amazing!

To be goaded by something that doesn't exist; love. What is love? Why can't love be seen or touched? Is it because there is no such thing? Is it because this thing we call love is truly in fact a force that only exists within the subject? 

Without the human mind there is no love. What we know as love touches nothing else but the human race. What is love to animals? What is love to our enemies? Love is a useless force when compared to the power of gravity, nuclear enerygy, and inertia, and many other physical forces. What can love possibly serve against an invading force from an alien world? Surely an alien race would be incapable of understanding such a concept as love and emotion. Those type emotions could very well be alien to them! Why is so much time wasted on a force that has no real productive use? Why, instead of falling into the arms of a lover and becoming one with them, do we not, as a human race striving for survival and success, drift our attention to other forces that serve a greater purpose? 

There is only one possible answer to that...

Because we're human. We are composed of flesh, bones, and emotions. To deny emotions would be to deny humanity.

Humanity...

Another force. The force that blinds."

"event","I was sitting at my computer thinking about life. Then I started thinking about books and movies and how they relate to life. I discovered that books, movies, and life are all very similar in at least one way. They all revolve around conflict.

What makes a book and a movie interesting? Why do we pay to read and watch these things? What makes us sit through a 2 hours movie or an 800 page book? 

Conflict.

Conflict is what makes everything interesting. Conflict is what makes a movie worth watching and a book worth reading. 

Every movie has it.
Every book has it.

Life should have it too.

Embrace the conflict in your life. Do not hate nor wish it away.Take it and appreciate it, because it will make your life a lot more interesting, despite the pain and sorrow it might bring."

"event","Wee. Woke up this morning and looked  at the mirror. I saw a handsome boy look back at me o.o and so i smiled. It was then that I knew that thigns would be okay. My hair looked better and my skin softer. :o so I looked in my closet and got the tightest clothes I had and wore them to school. I got some nice compliments. Then I licked my clay goblet o.o and my friends too pictures! Then I found this poem.

""Now Goes Under...""
Edna St. Vincent Millay

Now goes under, and I watch it go under, the sun
That will not rise again.
Today has seen the setting, in your eyes cold
and senseless as the sea,
Of friendship better than bread, and of bright charity
That lefts a man a little above the beasts that run.

That this could be!
That I should live to see
Most vulgar Pride, that stale obstreperous clown,
So fitted out with purple robe and crown
To stand among his betters! Face to face
With outraged me in this once holy place,
Where Wisdom was a favoured guest and hunted
Truth was harboured out of danger,
He bulks enthroned, a lewd, and insupportable stranger!

I would have sworn , indeed I swore it:
The hills may shift, the waters may decline,
Winter may twist the stem from the twig that bore it,
But never your love from me, your hand from mine.

Now goes under the sun, and I watch it go under.
Farewell, sweet light, great wonder!
You, too farewell - but fare not well enough to dream
You have done wisely to invite the night before the darkness came."

"event","Oh lord. today was...was weird.

We had a substitute for Mr. Wilkinson today (my philosophy teacher), right. Now, Darlene asks to see two of my fingers, and I saw that she had this little strap lock thing (you guys know those straps the cops use to cuff people when they don't have handcuffs?). I give her two of my fingers, and she puts that around them, and i'm thinking ""Fun."" Now, Darlene locks the thing really tight, and I start laughing and call her naughty.

After a few minutes it starts to hurt, and my fingers are turning blue o.o; so I ask Darlene to take it off.

""I can't,"" she says.

""What the hell? I thought you had scissors..."" 

""Nope,"" she said laughing.

""What the fuck Darlene!""

So now I'm walking around the class looking for some scissors! And I panic because my fingers start to hurt a lot more. My teacher locked the damn supplies, so I couldn't get any from the supply area. I was about to ask the teacher if I could run to the nurses office, when Matt (my savior who also doesn't like me very much) called me, and showed me scissors!

I rush to Matt and take the scissors...they weren't very good scissors. I tried to break the seal from the bottom area, but I was pinching my skin that way, and so I tried the top. The scissors couldn't cut through it! I keep trying and trying and finnaly I carve my way through the seal...and x.x breathe in. 

i was saved.

and the class thought it was funny XD.

I did too after awhile x.x

Now!

I went shopping today right after I got home from school. I got some new dress shoes and some new shirts and stuff.  I also ate EGG ROLLS and SHRIMP ROLLS (which, by the way Jordan, much bigger than egg rolls XD.)!

So yeah, we're driving back home and all. We were on the freeway. Suddenly I notice that a mini van on the right lane swerves towards the left lane (which we were on) and hits the car in front of us. The car in front of us spins out of control, and my dad is driving so fucking fast...but he hits the breaks (very slowly to avoid spinning out of control himself) and swerves right and left to slow down the car then finally swerves completely left (he's a very good driver, he's always avoiding collisions) and evades the other car (we almost hit it). He stops a little bit up ahead the car that got hit (who at this point is motionless) and gets out of the car and rushes to the damaged car. I look outside the back window and see that other cars have also stopped, then I see that they're trying to pull out the driver, and  that the car was covered in smoke. Then I saw flames, so I grabbed a cell phone and made a 911 call, and reported the accident. My dad gets hold of a fire extinguisher and puts out the fire. Then the random cops arrive (pretty fast too). Blah blah blah. They ask us what happen. I tell em what I saw. Turns out the guy in the car that got hit was drunk as hell. Minivan got away. The End."

"event","John Locke once said that man is born with natural rights, of which include life, liberty, and property. Locke believed that these rights should not be taken away, and argued the sole duty of government was to protect these natural rights, because in a state of nature man could not protect their rights effectively (ironically enough, Locke believed man was a reasonable, rational, and gentle creature). Man, he said, had to give up certain rights in order for the government to protect their natural rights. This is known as Locke's Social Contract.

Locke's ideas, though, is based on the assumption that man is rational. This, of course, we know not to be true. Man is naturally wicked, and must be kept in check in order to achieve harmony. 

The way to harmony is to destroy the causes of strife: private property, the family, liberty, and anything else that stands between the individual citizen and his complete loyalty and devotion to the state.

In other words, in order to achieve harmony, man must give up two of his natural rights instead of giving up certain rights (the right to take law into their own hands, the right to judge, etc.) like Locke argued.

When Man was put in the Garden of Eden, he was put there ""to dress it and to keep it,"" that is, to work; which proves that man was not born to be idle.

Work keeps Man free from three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty.

Man's only purpose under government should be to live and to work for the state. Man must be completely devoted to the state and deomonstrate civic virtue, that is, to work for the common welfare. 

This was the original purpose of a Nation-State; for men to gather around and work for the common welfare. 

The message, though, has gotten lost.

Man, nowadays, works for the benefit of himself, having been corrupted my individual rights.

The purpose of government has also been lost. It's original purpose was to take the resources gathered by its citizens and return it to them through welfare; social accommodations, education, health, protection, ect.

Today, though, governments ignore their very foundations, the people, and focus their attention and resources on the people of foreign nations. By doing this they have wronged the people, and have violated the Social Contract. It is the duty of the people, in that case, to rise up against the government that has overlooked it.

Once the people are under ""this"" governement, they need not think what the government can do for them, but what they can do for the government, and the government need not think what the people can do for them, but what they can do for the people. Under this reason, both factors work for the benefit of the other, and every resource circulates."

"event","I'm in a really good mood right now. I kinda had a breakdown awhile ago. I didn't think I could finish this project in time...but yeah, I did it. Well...it's not exactly finished. I'm the one doing all the work (I don't trust the rest of the group) and the rest of the group is going to make it fabulous. Now all I have to worry about is my history passport...the packet..and notes for the weekend...everything is looking good right now. I just hope Mrs. Wilson doesn't fuck up my schedule (she tends to do so).


Tomorrow I have to go to the dentist. I don't think that's going to kill my schedule...in fact, I planned on it.

School was fun. I had a good day. I like making people feel stupid.

Like those gangsters in my Law Enforcement class (a bit ironic, isn't?)

I heard them laughing in the bac as they about me, calling me a fag and stuff. Of course I'm used to this. I didn't plan to say anything unless they said something to me directly. I sat there hoping they would. Eventually they did.

""Hey, call that guy sitting next to you.""

The girl sitting next to me pokes my shoulder. I turn around.

""Yeah?""

""Hey, why are your nails so long?""

""Because I like them that way.""

""Why?""

""Same reason you have that trash over your body.""

""What?""

""Your clothes.""

""Oh. Would you wear nail polish?""

""If you give me some.""

""So you'd wear it?""

""If you give me some, sure.""

They laugh.

""Dude, are you gay?""

""What is it to you?""

""I don't know. He wants to know."" He points at some other gangster.

""Why do you want to know?"" I ask him. ""What? Are you interested or something?""

They laugh. ""No...""

""Then why do you want to know whether I'm gay or not? You're obviously seeking something from me, otherwise you wouldn't be showing such a keen interest in my sexuality.""

They laugh and tell me to forget about it.

""Right, I thought so."" The girl next to me laughs and tells me i did a nice job.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now, you're probably wondering about the ""Veni,vedi, vici"" thing. That actually translates to ""I came, I saw, I conquered"" and it was Julius Caesar's motto. This applies to my experience in my AP US Government Class. You see, that class has almost all of the original Honor/AP students from middle school. Those were the same students who underestimated me. The same ones who mocked me because I wasn't in higher classes. They were also, ironically, the once who motivated me to work harder.

Well, today in Government we had a debate. Of course, as you two already know, my ideology is a bit...Controversial. And...because of this...the whole class is always against me (like in philosophy). However, unlike all of them, I know how to debate, and I did not yield to them nor felt intimidated by them. I kept my position and held on to my guns. At one point my government teacher himself tried to attack me. This guy, like i've said before, is very scary. But I think I surprised him by barking right back at him with an intelligent response. The class was also a bit surprised, and I could hear my group congratulating me.

Well, long story short... I feel as if i've surpassed them all. I feel as if i've finally conquered them all. The thought of fighting off an entire classroom of young, high school, intellectuals revived feelings which I thought were gone. Feelings of superiority, feelings which I had once relinquished, are coming back to me. I've never felt this great before. Never have I felt this dominant. I've finally climbed my way up. I've reached the peak of the dominant hierarchy. Do I have power now? What is power? Power...the ability of one person to get another person to act in accordance with the first person's intentions. In other words, the ability to influence. If i've won power then I shall use it to my advantage. But...now that i'm at the top...Now I dare them, no, I invite them to bring me down."

And that's all I have to say about that.

I have pictures from the Bata Implosion uploadingd even as we speak.  

Let's see.  What I *HAD* posted before it decided to get all weird on me and delete: I did not pass the EMT-I 1st exam, but it's alright because I'm only 20 and have plenty of time to do it.  I'm still waiting to hear from the city on about the next stage of the application process....I'm not giving up but I don't have much hope.  And I'm presently working on a Rescue Stand-By team in Sparrows Point at the Bethlehem Steel Plant.  It's fun.  AAANNNNDDD.....I got a digital camera.  *wide ass grin*

Alright.  <a href=""http://bataimplosion.tripod.com/Bata_Implosion/"">Here</a> are the pictures from Bata.  I'll talk to you guys later.

Oh yeah, and <a href=""http://eclipse102704.tripod.com/Eclipse/"">here</a> are the pictures from the eclipse that night.

Tell me what good having a 95 response form is going to do when I don't have anything else on that call????!!!!

And here you go, what's so hard about putting the call type on the form?  All I want filled out is what date and the call was.  Maybe the box if you have it....but just put them in the right order!  According to the records, 213 is an automatic alarm when in actuality it was a PI!

"event","You know what?  I was thinking today.  Probably something I should try to stay away from doing.  It really kinda got me to wondering about something.

R. Adams Cowley was a great, great man.  He did so much for EMS and prehospital care in Maryland.  For those of you who don't know about him....here's a bit of history....

Cowley was a doctor back in the day.  He worked in the old time shock trauma, back when it was only 2 beds and the survival rate was 20%.  He came up with the whole golden hour and platinum ten minute theories.  Said that most people have an hour to receive care and restore a normal blood pressure before they would die.  He ended up proving his theory.  He also was the creator of shock trauma being it's own entity....in it's own building.  We, here in Baltimore, have one of very few 'free-standing' shock trauma centers in the country.  Now patients brought to shock trauma have a higher mortality rate (I think it's somewhere in the 90's, now).  And it's all because of Cowley's theory and testing.

But it got me to thinking.  It's really expensive for physical therapy and continued medical treatment.  And how many of those patients that we 'save' do we actually save?  How many can eventually go back to leading normal lives?  And how many have to depend on constant help for the rest of their lives?  How many were actually *meant* to die, and because of what we're trained to do, live?  Are we screwing with something that we shouldn't be screwing with?

I suppose I'm thinking too much about it.  If it weren't meant to happen, it wouldn't happen, right?  Like I said earlier, I should probably stay away from thinking....*laughs*

Let's just say I started my EMT-I (CRT) class today.  It's going to be fun.....and very time consuming.  Though I think it'll DEFINATELY be worth it.  There are so many reasons to take this class....I'm really excited about it.

Though the amount of books is murder.  *grins*  Alright....so I'm burned and tired....I'll babble at'ya later!

I *might* be going with a friend to see her plants tomorrow.  I know, it sounds funny.  But she says we get to take kayaks....so that's all good.

We start our EMT-I class this saturday.  I'm actually really excited about it, which I think is fairly odd considering I'm not really an EMS junkie.  *shrugs*  Oh well.  I think this is Bessie's doing.  I can't stand the thought of her being the only ALS provider around....*shudders*

Hmm....what else.  Oh, I've started going through the garage.  I've only gone through about 1/4 and I've already come across more shit.  *shakes head*  This is going to take a while.

Uherm....I've managed to get sun poisoning, which I believe is amazing since I've never been sunburned in my life.  I think it the medication I'm on, it's made me more sensitive to the sun.  But I tell you what, I don't like being sunburned or sun poisoned.  It's painful and I don't feel very well.  It sucks.

Hmmm....what else.  The firehouse has been rearranged.  We have 4 baydoors on fireside, 2 pieces of equipment per door.  Well, one of the doors is broken.  Sooo, we had to rearrange.  We put the 2 pieces of equipment that we use the least in those 2 bays: the air unit, which usually only goes out after everything else has and the brush truck, which is small enough to back up and pull out another bay door.  And now we have 116 where the utility is normally parked.  Our safety queen Lt. is using the museum, which is where 116 is normally, as a classroom for safety camp tomorrow.

I don't really think there is anything else to write about now...soooo, I'm going to go.  G'night."

As for the rest of things, they've been circling around the fact that we need another place to live.  In about 10 to 20 days.  The owners of the house we are currently occupying came home and gave us 60 days to get out.  Not much time to find a house to buy or rent that handles 6 to 7 people, also equivilating to 4 rooms.  My parents are really beginning to lose it, and the rest of us are dancing around the idea of being shipped out to Mongolia for living quarters.  It.  Really.  Sucks.

I hate moving around so much.  We lived in Maryland for going on 10 years and we've lived in 5 different places.  I can't stand this moving all the time.  It's almost like clockwork.  Every two years we should just start expecting to look for someplace new.  *sighs*

And as for IV Tech, I still have to get down to the hospital to get my sticks.  I should have gone today, I bet it was busy.  And tomorrow I'm back to job hunting.  I have a few places I am going to go.  I didn't quite get to them in time on friday.  So hopefully that goes well.  *crosses fingers*

Very pleased.  Very pleased indeed.

Let's see,  I don't know if I've informed you about the tests.  I took the BCoFD test on the 22nd of May.  It really was an insult to my intelligence.  If *ANYONE* fails that test....*shakes head*....And I take the BCFD test sometime in June.  I don't remember what day exactly.  I really want to be in the city.  I don't know why....

So it looks like we won't be moving to the house across the street.  The hurricane did a number on the roof, which we really all knew about anyway, and it's going to take some time and money - neither of which the owner has to spare at the moment - to fix.  So mom went to Uncle Frank the other day and hopefully we'll find a place through him.  

I just hope it's not far from HdG.  I love that town.   Out of <b>ALL</b> of the places I've <b>EVER</b> lived, HdG is one of my favorites....and I've lived a <b>LOT</b> of places.  *sighs*

She's gonna be 9 this year.  I've had her since 6 weeks, and now she's going to be 9.  Jesus....and she's perfect for me.  She adapts to new surroundings very well.  We've lived in 4 different places in her 9 short years of living.  And she's quickly adjusted to each of them.  Though, this time, I think it's going to be harder.  I hope not.  She had a hard time adjusting when the boys and I changed rooms.  But I think that was more because we still live in the same house and all.

"event","Alright, so happy times.  I went to see Laulena Jaina Renee <*growls cause livejournal doesn't take ALT commands*> today.  We looked through all her old drawings.  And when I say old....I mean OLD!  *grin*

*sings*  Gotta go fishin!

Ah-hem....anyway.  I might wander down into HdG this evening for a little midnight lighting watching down at the pier.  I sat up on the top of the Paradise Rd. hill and watched the lighting weave it's magic in the clouds.  It was awesome how it jumped from cloud to cloud just to touch each other.  How it would dip down, like the end was a ping-pong ball thrown forcefully into the water, and it would bounce back up to the surface of the water, or in this case the clouds.  How one little bolt could cause millions of other bolts to emerge, causing the sky to light up as if one was staring into a city at night from a far away hill top.  It was absolutely magnificent.  I would like to take a camera up there one night and try to catch some of those images.  That would be grand.

O_o  Now I sound like Mrs. B.  That's just GRAND!  *giggles*

*Sings* I can eat them evvvvv-ry day!

Right.  So as I was getting out of my truck tonight, I hear a whistle blowing in the backround.  I turn on my pager and realize it's HdG's.  I found that to be amazing since I can barely hear Aberdeens at times.

I caught a frog tonight.  B-Uddy almost ran it over.  This thing was huge and it was sitting right under his tire.  It would have made quite the mess.  :)

*sings*  And my mom says that's, okay....

Let's see, what else can I mindlessly babble about on here?  Oh I know.  The Bin broke my plate.  The one that comes with the cup about the size of your head.  The cup was Marvins the Martian head and the plate had his shoes all over it.  Anyway, I digress.  Aparently the husband had a piece of chicken on it and Bin was trying to eat it.  It seems that she knocked it off the table and it landed on the edge of one of our wooden chairs and it broke........clean in half.  0_0  Right.  I don't believe it, but husband says that's how it happened.  All I know is that my cup is now plateless, for the time being anyway.

*sings*  I love the fishes cause they're soooo delicious....

Alright.  So I think I'm going to go to bed instead because my spelling is for shit and that's usually a sign to sleep.  I'll sing, erm, babble more later!

*sings*  Gotta go fishin!"

"event","Grrr.  Things are really beginning to tick me off around here.  Like certain people hearing the tail end of conversations and running to her boyfriend about it.  So boyfriend comes and has a 'talk' with me about it.  Like I told him,  it was not her place to do so and it's for reasons like that that people have a hard time liking her.

Next thing that ticks me off.  When someone who is supposed to be an example, and is also a past officer, goes about doing something so completely wrong that it's not even funny.  

When someone does something you feel is wrong, the correct thing to do would be to pull them off to the side and have a little chat with them, correct?  Not to lay into them in front of other members of the company?  Yeah....I figured you were supposed to talk to them in private as well.  

Brief description of what happened....A group of the guys and I went putt putting last night.  Well, when we were done and sitting around talking there was an accident right at the entrance to the putt putt place involving a motorcycle.  We ended up flying one patient to shock trauma.  Well, I was the primary provider on said patient, and he wasn't exactly with it.  So going along with my protocols, I cut off his shirt to get a better view of any possible injuries.  (((He had chest injuries - possible bruised ribs - and sternum road rash)))  Anyway, when the ambulance left I was cleaning up the mess that was made and I grabbed the shirt I cut off and tossed it in the back of the engine.

We get back to the station and one of the guys on the engine calls my name.  He was standing in front of a group of guys who don't particularly like me or some guys from the group I hang out with.  Anyway, he starts asking me if I was the one who put the shirt there.  I told him I was and he starts 'yelling' at me about how he could have gotten blood on his turnout.  I told him I was sorry, I hadnt' thought about it because when I tossed in back there I knew there wasn't any blood.  I hadn't thought to inform them.  *Impish grin*  My mistake.  He told me that there could have been blood and that the next time I should toss the shirt in my own personal truck.  All the while his voice was raised and he was absolutely convinced that he was absolutely correct.

I said nothing to him at the time, I just walked away.  I later went to the chief, who also happens to be related to said individual, and he became quite defensive before sputtering something about having a talk with said member.

There are several reasons why I'm really pissed:  

1.  If I had thrown it in my truck and I *had* missed some blood, where does that put me?  I have no protective clothing on and it puts me at risk for exposing my truck.  

2.  If I had left it where it was, John Q. Public could have gotten ahold of it not knowing any better putting themselves at risk.  

3.  My mistake for throwing it *unprotected* in the back of the engine.  I still would throw it there as opposed to leaving it or putting it in my personal vehicle.  At least the firefighters in the back of the engine had protective clothing on.  

4.  He,  being a firefighter in the back of the engine and not the officer of the call, had no right to be talking to me about it.  It was his job to speak to the officer, who would *then* come to me.  

5.  He had *NO RIGHT* to do it where it was done.  Period.  

6.  Even if he had been the one responsible for talking to me, he was 'reprimanding' me for the wrong reason.

7.  For his lack of concern for my and the publics well being.

8.  For his lack of concern and respect for myself and my feelings.

9.  My chief's lack of concern over the whole thing.

I think number 9 really pissed me off more.  When I went to talk to him, he instantly became defensive.  I don't care who I'm complaining about.  It could be his own mother.  If the person was wrong, then it should be taken care of.  I honestly don't think anything will be done.....if the chief is left to his own devices.  We shall see.  I could be wrong.  But I'm not going ot leave it to chance.

I'm tired of people thinking they can walk all over me.  I'm tired of it.   ""Yes, she'll do this.  Yes,  she'll do that.  No, we don't need to please her.  She won't say anything anyway.""  Boy will they be surprised when I finally do open my mouth.  

And someone in the higher ups is really beginning to show his true colors.  Unconcerned about intercompany relations, as was shown when he complained about a picture I have of two officers of another company leaning on a piecec of our apparatus.  Thinks it's ""Bad for morale(sp)"".  That's exactly what he said.  Though, if someone walks in and sees that picture, ,they're going to think: ""Hey, good to see that they get along with other companies"".  That's what i thought.  New members won't think that we hate each other because we hardly ever drill with them.  The only people who have a problem with that picture are the people who have some form of problem with the people *in* the picture.  *grumbles*

He's unconcerned about keeping certain members happy and doing everything in his power to keep others satisfied.

He babbles about something that looks good to the public, but isn't interested in listening about what actually needs to be put.

It's just a bunch of little things....and I probably shouldn't be babbling about it on here.  But no names were mentioned to protect the innocent and the not-so innocent.

All of that coupled with the move.  Oh yeah, another topic of great joy in my life at the moment.  The move.  Mom comes to me the other night after a call while I was cleaning up and tells me that when we move this august, dad won't be coming with us......again.  He can't live the way we are living.  I find that to be totally irresponsible on his part.  He has a 10 year old son to be thinking about.  When they chose to have children, they chose to put their lives on hold, and they chose to devote their lives to said children.  You don't just walk out on them unless your life is threatened or your actions with the signifigant other will affect the child in any way.  Neither of which has occured this time.  Last time was different....but there is no excuse this time.

God do I need a vacation....

On a happy note, I took the Baltimore County test yesterday afternoon.  And a certain 'Shrek' ditched me.  *smiles and shakes head*  He told me to meet him at the park and ride and we'd go up together - And get this,  he is an officer from another company.  I wonder if the higher up doesn't want me hanging out with *him*, either? - Anyway, I get about 50 phone calls from various and sundried people that morning stating that he wasn't feeling well and that he was going to have to miss it.  I have to bap him one.  *grins*  He really did miss a simple test.  100 questions done in about 1/2 hour.

16.  If an arm is immobilized, it is: 
    a.  Bloody
    b.  Unable to move
    c.  Bent backwards
    d.  Removed from the body

I'm serious, they were all like that.  The only part that was semi difficult were the ""Put these in the logical order"", and that's only because you had to put them in order and then answer questions about them.  *giggles*

The City's is coming up soon, as well.  That's really where I want to be hired.  I don't know why, but I've always wanted to work in the city.  However, either will do.  I just want to be paid to do this job.  I want to be able to do this all the time and not take time out to go to work, you know?

I do need a job until then, though.  Like I said earlier, I quit HtH.  I also only lasted a day at Crown.  That place was an abomination and I wouldn't wish it on my enemies.  I do have a job at Paramedical Personnel of Maryland.  I'm a BLS instructor.  I teach CPR, First Aid, and Health Care Provider.  I'm not too sure what the Health Care Provider course is yet.  I still have yet to sit in on one.  I can teach the others already, though.

What was supposed to happen was I was supposed to sit through each course once as a student, once as a support instructor, and then I could go out on my own when I was comfortable to do so.  Well,  I got to skip the 'sit in as a student part' because I've been an EMT long enough in the volly service.  All I had to do was support until I was comfy.  Well....I 'supported' a first aid and CPR course already.  Meaning I took a group of the class and taught them how to do CPR and first aid.  *shrugs*  It'll be nice.  It'll be a refresh on my CPR, which I needed to do anyway.  And then I can help with Pre-Basic at Level.

Hmm.  Thought.  Maybe we should put first aid on the prebasic list.  A bunch of the probies aren't interested in taking a medical first.  Actually, hardly any are.  It'll give them an idea on what to do until they get first responder or EMTB.  Maybe I'll talk to Craig about that.  I don't really remember what kind of medical stuff, other than CPR, was required for prebasic.

Alright....so enough complaints and babbles.  I""m going to bed...if I can sleep.  I might....oh nevermind, you don't want to know anyway.  *devilish grin*"

Erm...we had a nasty <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/raysmemories/8098.html"">PI Rescue</a> yesterday afternoon.  It made the news,  though it was only a five second clip.  <a href=""http://cms.firehouse.com/content/article/article.jsp?id=30207&sectionId=46"">The <b>BIG</b> mess in Baltimore</a> outside the tunnel was a little bit bigger of a story.  It's alright, though.

*stomps around growling ""Rar Rar Rar"" in responce to the PI yesterday*

ALright, now that that is out of my system.  I'm oh so anxiously awaiting the results to the I test.  *please note the sarcasm*  After what I saw yesterday, I'm afraid to continue with the medical side of things.  I really don't want to be apart of that.  And if you haven't picked up with what I'm talking about, I'm going to let it drop.  You know the old saying: ""No need to air dirty laundry.""

Alright.....I'm going to go update my journal.  I think I have a few PI's to put down.  I'll have to check.

Update:  I never put down the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/raysmemories/7733.html"">PI Rescue</a> we had on the 4th of the month.  How could I have forgotten???  :)"

"event","Let me tell you how frustrated I was today at work.  I up and left.  Just said: ""I'm done and I'm not coming back today.""  What finally set me off?  The dispatcher calls and asks us to come back to the Churchville office so I can move my truck - I was blocking someone in.  Well, she calls us back about 5 minutes later and asks our ETA.  I tell her about 5 minutes.  A moment of silence.  Then: ""You don't have to come here anymore.  We've got it moved.""  That was the last straw.  I had my driver take me back to the office so they could explain to me what had happened.  It seemed that one of the office workers didn't want to wait for us to get there, so they climbed into my truck, popped it into neutral, and pushed it out of the way(I drive a stick).  That really did it.  I went back, tossed my paperwork into the bin, clocked out, and left.  I am so tired of being told there is a quarter on the floor, bending over to pick it up, then being fucked hard and dry.  And in the end said quarter ends up being non-existant.  Frustrating.  Grr.

Alright.  I'm done.  I need to go home and get some sleep.  :D

I'll do some non-bitching later....hopefully!  ;)"

We had fun last night.  A bunch of us went over to one of the guys house and had a nice little bon fire.  It was fun.  And we figured something out.  Guys get depressed when they drink, girls drink because they're depressed.  *grins*  I really don't know why we came to this conclusion, but we did.

Rico was sent to Harford yesterday for dog bites.  He owns about 4 pitbulls.  Well, two of them started 'argueing'.  Rico and his mother decided to stop them and consiquently ended up being bitten themselves.  I don't know about Rico's mother, but Rico was pretty messed up.  He ended up with about 4 stitches in his knee.  The bite went into his muscle, along with some air bubbles, so it's going to hurt for awhile.  And I think he had various butterfly bandages on his wrist from bites there as well.  Needless to say he's going to be out for a bit.  But we're just thankful that he's alright.  :)

So Justy's birthday was on wednesday.  He gave me this lovely list of things he wants.  Varies from ""fake dog poo poo"" to ""F-14"".  Isn't that grand!  *laughs*  He does have a few things on there that are actually buyable.  Well...the ""fake dog poo poo"" is buyable, but I don't know if my parents would appreciate it.  :D  

And moms birthday is tomorrow.  She has this list as well, but I have yet to see it.  Tony has it now.  Says he's going to get one thing on it, give it to my sister, she's going to get one thing on it, and then give it to me....and so on.  But we also have to take into acount mothers day on the 9th.  So it's going to be a spending frenzy here soon.

So I've quit HtH.  I think I said that before.  But the grand thing is I already have another job.  My last day at HtH is next wednesday and my first day of the other job is the following monday.  So all is well.  :)  Though, it is going to be a bit of a pay cut.  But then again, it's going to be hard finding part time work that pays what I was getting at HtH.  *shrugs*  I guess that's why it's called temporary.  :D

So I've put my name on the list for Baltimore City, I'm taking a test for Baltimore County, I'm putting in an application for AA County, and I might put one in for Fairfax.  I have to think about that one.  Hopefully one of them will come through.  *crosses fingers*  Alright.  So I'm going to take this oppurtunity to go now.  All is updated and blah blah blah."

"event","Right....so I'm done with HtH.  I was pissed but willing to work up until they accused me of doing things I didn't do.  And then wouldn't listen to my side of the story.  I don't deal with that very well.  So I put my two weeks notice in.  Lemme' 'splain.

I already explained about my calling out sick on saturday.  Well, one of the higher ups wishes to talk with me.  So I go in, also wanting to get my check.  He says, I have a few things we need to talk about. 

One is your being late.  I was in an accident and called the dispatcher to tell her, but that didn't matter.  I was late so it had to be written up.  That's 1.  

What happened on saturday.  That's 2.  

This next little part just kills me.  He accused me of falling asleep on a patient....a psychiatric patient.  Right.  I don't know who 'complained', but it was written in his report that I was sleeping in the back of the unit with a psych pt and their family on board.  Here's what it was.  I sit in the captains chair.  I lean my head against the wall and write my reports.  That's how I sit, that's how I've always sat.  Especially when my pt is sleeping.  You can ask any of my old partners.  But apparently someone thought I was sleeping and wrote it up.  HtH wasn't interested in hearing my side.  I was being accused and therefore was guilty.  That's 3.  

And the last little bit that finally did it.  He pulled out a report that stated that I left the unit in complete disarray.  That always pisses me off when I come into work and find the unit dirty.  Well, one morning I came in and found potatoe chips, paperwork, garbage, 4x4's, alcohol preps, and dirty linen all over the place.  There were pen marks on the ceiling and seats, there were flower petals all over the floor....I mean, you name it it was there.  Down to there being blood on the floor.  I was livid that morning.  But, just like anyother time, if I were to have said something nothing would have been done.  So I just wrote everything down on the back of my preshift check sheet and put it in the box.  Well, one of our ALS providers called in however, and complained.  Well....when they looked back they saw that I was the last one in the unit when the ALS provider made the complaint and assumed it was me.  The higher up I was talking to didn't believe me until I began describing everything on his sheet w/o having seen the paper yet.  That's 4.

I don't do very well when I'm accused of doing things that I don't do, and then don't even get a chance to have the situation investigated.  So I'm quitting.  I really don't care where I go, just so long as the higher up's treat their employees like people, not shit.  I got suspended for a shift over the whole sleeping thing.  I'm very angry with them.  And like I said, because I am the accused I must be guilty.  *sighs*

Other than that everything is going well.  I finally got my Rescue Tech. card in the mail.  Yay!  So now it's all official and everything.  Yay!"

"event","I really hate my job.  *grins*  I am so tired.  Yesterday was probably one of the worst days I've had.  

My second day in I was ill and didn't come to work.  I wasn't going to go to class either, but mom reminded me that if I felt ill I could just run into the bathroom.  So I went to the class.  Knowing full well that one of the dispatchers for HtH was also in class, so it's not like I was trying to ditch work and 'pull a fast one'.  Anyway, back to the point.  Last night.

I get to work and the Major is there.  He's babbling about how my driver and I are going to do two cath calls in the morning with him.  Alright....so he's putting the narcs on our unit and 'preparing' it for the morning.  I do a pre shift check and he starts yelling at me because I didn't check something that I don't need to check.  Long story.  But he and I got into it.  So I went in and went to bed.  I was tired and I still don't feel very well.  My supervisor comes in about 5 minutes later and explains that ""Company policy is that we can't sleep before 11"".  So I get back up and go sit on the couch.  He then proceeds to try to make me feel like I've been caught doing something bad.

Super: ""Where were you yesterday?""
Me: ""I was sick.""
Super: ""Sick huh?""
Me: ""Yeah....""
Super: ""Well, next time your sick, don't get caught at your class.""

I just looked at him.  He started to leave, but I cut him off.

Me: ""I'm not dumb.  I know Jen was in that class.  If I was really trying to ditch work when I wasn't sick, I wouldn't have gone to class either.  And I really don't appreciate your insinuation that I'm stupid.""

He really didn't say much after that.  He just left.  So the Major comes back and says that we're not doing those cath calls but are going to be in a different unit for the evening and that in the morning we'd be going to churchville to stage while the other crews are out.  Alright, that's fine and dandy too.  So I do another preshift check and we discover that the unit has half a tank of fuel.  So at 2200 we go get fuel.  Get back at about 2230.  We sit until 2300 and I'm about to go to bed when we get a call.  Harfrod to Sheppard Pratt.  ""*sigh*""  So we up and do this call, and on our way back we get dispatched another Harford to Sheppard Pratt.  On our way back to Harford, our dispatcher calls and tells us to go to Union instead.  So we get to Union just as we get our info.  It's a Union to Sheppard Pratt.  ""*sighs again*""  We get done with this call and it's not about 0500.  Dispatch sends us to Churchville to stage.  Then says we need to go to the Towson office to pick up the Major because he dropped off an ambo there and needed a ride home.  So we're on our way there when the ALS crew calls and says they'd go get him.  So we get sent back to HdG.  We get there about 0600 and go to bed.  At about 0645 dispatch calls and wants us to pick the Major up from Churchville to take him back to HdG to get his car.  We muddle around and finally go out to the unit.  Just as we're getting in and about to go, the Major comes out and asks where we were going.  So we climb out of the unit and go back to sleep.  Then, at about 0715, dispatch calls and asks where we were and if we were en route to Churchville yet.  So we have to explain all that.  Then we go back to sleep.  And finally, at 0745, the Major wants me up to clean my unit before we leave.

I was very upset.  Let's just say that when I got home and went to sleep, I didn't get up until 0700 this evening.  Just enough time to wake up and go back to work.  yay.

ALright....bitch session over.  I might write something else on here later.  G'night...."

I'll give her milk in a saucer whenever she wants....likewise with the tuna.  And it normally works that way with going out, so long as the weather is nice.

I love her.  :D

And milk.  I absolutely adore milk.  Yum!






I really don't know what spawned that.  But it makes me feel slightly better having said it.  

I have a feeling I'm going to lose my job tomorrow.  I'm going to call out.  I'm taking this BTLS class and I got absolutely no help from my higher-ups at work to find replacements.  I mean, I need this class to keep my certification, to keep my job.  Well....I take the class and I lose the job.  *shrugs*  Whatever happens, happens I suppose.

M'tired.....so m'gonna lay down....g'night...."

At nights, the HdG crew get's sent to Towson to sit....but is still responsible to run all the BLS calls they would get that night.  Most BLS calls that come in are generally in Bel Air or Elkton.  Does this make sense to you?  Make the only BLS crew on duty to sit at least 45 minutes away from the majority of the calls?  I mean, we haven't had *ANY* BLS calls in Towson since that office opened, yet they want the only BLS crew to sit up there.  Meanwhile, the ALS crews sit all night until an ALS call comes in, which doesn't happen very often.  The majority of the ALS calls are usualy in by the beginning of shift and are scheduled for the mornings.  It doesn't make any sense.  *shakes head*"

The firehouse is still turning.  Things have quieted down a bit.  Hawkeye tried to get the company to over ride the boards decision, but that didn't go over very well.  And unfortunately, Donny didn't get into 2, 5, or 5-9 because of what happened up here.  You know, looking back, if I had known that this was going to happen, I wouldn't have written him up in the first place.  Though, I don't really think it would have mattered anyway.  Yeah, he was becoming a bothersome Lt., but he was still a provider for the ambulance.  Whether or not he was good or bad I can't really say because I never rode with him, but I've mostly only heard good things.  There was occasions, but not enough to say we're probably better off.  I just think he was having a major power trip/having a hard time equalizing power over friendship.  I don't know if that made sense to you guys, but it did to me.  

I dunno'....I've just been thinking a lot about him lately.  Mostly since Danny and I talked the other night.  I mean, we didn't talk about any one thing in particular.  I just let him vent a bit.  He's got some valid points, and he's in a really rough spot, but I think he needs to stand up and make a stand to someone.  I'm not too sure who that someone is because I'm not Dan and I don't know what he truely believes( I can make a good guess based on how he acts/what he says).....but it needs to be done.  He's being pulled in so many different directions and he's keeping his mouth shut about everything.  Some things should be said, though.

Oh well.  *cough cough*  Oh ick!  I wish I could cough this shit up and have it just be done with!  *grumbles*

"event","Now just so you know, I'm not posting this as a ""Catholic is the way to go"" type of post.  I just thought this was interesting.


<b>Allah or Jesus?</b>
By Rick Mattes

Last month I attended my annual training session that's  required for maintaining my state prison security clearance. During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers representing the Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim faiths, who explained each of their belief systems.

I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam  had to say. The Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a video.   

After the presentations, time was provided for questions and  answers.
   
When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked: ""Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that most Imams and clerics   of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world. And, that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?""
 
There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he replied, ""Non-believers!""

I responded, ""So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they   can go to Heaven. Is that correct?""
 
The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, ""Yes.""
 
I then stated, ""Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to Heaven!""
 
The Imam was speechless. 
 
I continued, ""I also have a problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question.  Would you rather have your Allah who tells you to kill me in order to go to Heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to Heaven and He wants you to be there, too?""
 
You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.
  
Needless to say, the organizers and/or promoters of the 'Diversification' training seminar were not happy with Rick's way of dealing with the Islamic Imam and exposing the truth about the Muslim's beliefs.  

I think everyone in the U.S. should be required to read this, but with the liberal justice system, liberal media, and the ACLU, there is no way this will be widely publicized. Please pass this on to all your e-mail contacts.
 
This is a true story and the author, Rick Mattes, is a well-known leader in prison ministry.

<i>Side note: I would just like you all to know that I am not a religion basher. I did not post that to create harsh feelings. I, as I've mentioned at other times, just felt that someone who claimed to have such a position in the Muslim religion would say such things.

I myself believe that anyone can believe anything they wish. As an ignorant person to the ways of the Muslim religion, I post an apology to any I may have offended. I did not intend this to be as crude as it may have seemed....</i>"

I also cleaned the shit outta the radio room.  It's amazing what you find when you clean an area that hasn't been really cleaned in a very long time.  It took me about an hour.  The room is not that big.  I also found these quotes, and one is really neat.

""Life is not measured by the breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath.""

I like that.  It's very true.  It's one of those things that you know, you just never think about.

I don't want to go home either.  I *REALLY* don't want to sit up here by myself all night, but it looks like I have no choice.  I *could* go down to HdG and see if anyone's at the Hose Company....I might do that anyway.  I dunno' yet.

*sigh*  I wish Jaina were here.  She's make things all better.  But nOo....she had to go to college.  :)  

My finger looks really bad.  Dan and I went into the back to help Alice, Dave, and Alex set up for breakfast tomorrow and now it's back to being as swollen as it was in the first place.  If it's not better by tomorrow night(and by better I mean looking better, not completely better), I guess I'm going to have to make an appointment to go up to Kirk to get it looked at.  Fortunately, the knuckles not as sore anymore.  That's always a plus.

So mom and J-man are spending another night down....erm, up....at Susans.  Dad is up in Pittsburg for the weekend.  Tony's in, uhm....I can't remember, but he's there and it's not here.  So it was just me and Anth this weekend.  It was a nice change from the ordinary.

"event","Well....I struck again.  Literally.  I nearly broke my left hand pointer the other day in class.  Trying to pry into a car door with a pry-bar and an 8-lb maul, my finger slipped and I smashed it between the two.  I didn't even have enough time to give Evan the maul and take off my glove before it had started swelling and bruising.  Everyone thought it was broken....except Steve and I.  And maybe Colby.  Steve palpated it, and while he was doing so I yanked on Colby's sleeve because I didn't want to yell.  It hurt like a bitch!  But all is well.  I only damaged the muscle enough to keep me incapacitated for a few days.  The doctor has it splinted and wishes me not to use it.  It's kinda weird.  He wrote me a note to stay out of work until the 4th, and another one for the firehouse to stay inactive for 2 to 3 days since the 30th.  It's weird.  But Kathy was not too pleased about it at all.

While I'm sitting in the ER, my shift supervisor and his partner stoll by to pick up a patient.  Of course, they stop in to see what's going on....why I was there.  I explained to him what happened and he went on his merry way.  Well, not more than 45 minutes later my phone starts to ring.  It's HtH.  Kathy was calling to ask me about my finding a replacement for work for the next day(I had class and therefore was out both my day shifts).  I explained to her that I hadn't been able to find one, hence the reason I had gone to her 3 days prior to ask for her help.  She says:  ""You have to come into work tomorrow.""  Well, that's all fine and dandy, but the doctor doesn't want me to work.  So I explained this to her, and she comes back with: ""I find it interesting that <insert name here> broke his finger and all he did was tape it up.  And he came back to work the next day.""  Well, this little trip of mine to the ER is being covered by the Harford County Government and I'm not about to do something to piss them off and keep them from paying.  I told her that I was going to bring her the doctors note as soon as soon as I got out, which I did, and she said that she was sorry it had to be this way.  Which I don't quite understand.  Well....I have a theory, but I'm not about to go abouts putting it on here.  It has proven to be a bad thing to put one's opinion on here....*glances towards a certain young lady*....but that's neither here nor there.

Anyroad....I ended up being the referee for my parents again.  I'm going to leave this at that.  Let's just say I ended up at Evan's house.  Oh....and with a funny story to go along with it.  :D

I'm up at the firehouse, just got there, and David comes strolling out.  He asked me if we had any tools on the engine to get something out of a toilet.  Of course, my first question was ""What did you drop and how far did it go?""  His belt buckle fell off and landed in the urinal and he didn't want to reach into there to pull it out(I don't blame him....).  So I told him to double glove and just pull it out that way.  Well, he's not quite used to taking medical gloves off yet and when he pulled, he still ended up getting urinal water on him.  :)  So he washed his hands and headed over to his house so he could change his pants.  Well, while I'm waiting for him to get changed, I roll down the window in his truck to call the cat.  He comes back out and I go to put the window up, but it won't go.  He then tells me that the window won't *go* up.  So we have to take his door apart to get the window up.  Well, before we did that, I told him to go grab a pair of plyers....(the glass was *RIGHT* there, we just couldn't get a good grip on it)....and before I could explain to him to buffer the metal-to-glass contact with a glove or towel or something, he grabs the window and starts to yank.  Well, as I'm sure you guessed, it didn't work too well.  He, fortunately for him, chipped the glass.  He's lucky he didn't break it completely.  Anyway, so he tried it again and chipped it again.  *THEN* he grabbed a glove and tried.  Well, that didn't work so we took the door compeltely apart.  In the process, it was locked.  Well....so was the drivers side door.  None of us realized that until I went to put my jacket in his truck and couldn't get in.  So Dave yanked open the back window and climbed through....I could have sworn he was gumby!  :D  It was *very* funny.

But for now I'm going to go....."

"event","The past few days have been....Good grief.  I think that explains it in a nutshell.  Spent friday night down at House 2 in HdG with Craig, Drew, Evan, Matt, and Kristin.  We tried to go to Coakleys, but I could't quite get in.  It was rather amusing.  I looked at Craig and told him that I wasn't going to get in because I looked 12.  He thought otherwise.  Out of three underage, I was the only one who didn't get in.  :D

Then last night I spend the night out at 2 with Craig, Evan and mom.  It was fun all-in-all.  Didn't go home until about 6ish.  Didn't wake up today until about 4ish.  Went to bowling all light-headed and kinda loose feeling.  *wide ass grin*  And amazingly, I bowled all three over my average.  135, 152, and 121.  Yes, I know.  I'm a terrible bowler....but I still bowled well for me.  :D

At the end of bowling, we got a firecall, so I hauled ass down here.  This is where I sit.  Thinkin' about going home.  Maybe not.  I dunno'.  I'm not tired, but I have nothing to do.  Eric wants me to come over to ""play xbox with him"".  I don't think so.  I know what he wants and I'm not going to give it to him.  I'm not some dollar store whore.  Hey, that rhymes.

Alright, so I'm going to go now.  I'll babble more at you later.  Night."

"event","Well, I should probably be in bed right now....but I'm conducting an experiment.  So when I'm done with this I'll go.  Now, let me recap the past few nights and then today.

Two nights ago:  I work at the HdG office.  We run our asses off.  We get very little(as in 1 hour) sleep.  Yes, tired.  When I finally did get off work, I had things to do(ie pick up check, pay bills, and there was something else, but I don't remember)....so I didn't get a really good nap.

Last night:  I worked at the HdG office again and got a little more sleep(about 2 to 3 hours).  Right after work, I had to go to Towson to drop off my application for Baltimore County.  I dunno' if I'll even be looked at, but at least I tried.  

Oh, side story.  It was kinda comical.  As Rachel and I are going through Bel Air, we come to the red light next to the mall at Rt. 24 and the mall near the McDonalds.  Across the road, stopped at the red light, and in the turn lane, is a SUV with someone standing with the drivers side door open, talking ot the driver.  Well, the light turns green for the turn people, and the person talking moves to the back of the SUV and starts to push....all the way through the light and into the McDonalds parking lot.  It was funny looking....

Anyroad....now that I'm done being distracted....*mind wanders a moment*....

<b>113 IS BACK!</b>  You have no idea how much this pleases me.  It totally makes up for the lousy two nights of work I had.  We spent two hours restocking it and it's now in service.  I'm am <b>SO VERY PLEASED!</b>  *wide ass grin*  It was funny....while we were restocking, Evan was taking a 50 foot section of 3 inch to the front bumper.  Matt saw him and here's what happened:

Matt:  Hey Evan, now you know what I feel like everyday....
Evan:  Yeah, 50 feet of hose and it never gets used!

Teehee!

After we made sure everything was where it was supposed to be, I went home to clean up and go with mom to dinner.  I had eaten pizza, but she was hungry, so I went with her anyway.  *makes a face*  I digress....anyroad, we get done with dinner and decide to see if Craig is up at House 2.  Of course, he is.  He, Chad + Tommy(and their respective others), Jimmie from Abingdon, and Kristin from Joppa are up there talking in front of 512.  So we stop in and I end up staying the majority of the night there....just chit-chatting with Craig and the gang.  Eventually, everyone filtered through and it ended up being a bunch of Level guys hanging out in front of 512 blaring country music.  If Bobby were in town....*grins*....

Well, as we were leaving we see these three guys smashing the hell out of this little white car.  It was very odd.  Well, Craig started yelling toward us while he shut the bay doors and made sure everything was all cleaned up.  The dudes thought he was yelling at them and got ignorant with us.  It ended up resulting in us leaving and calling the police.  I'm not too sure what happened, but when I went back to House 2 to retrieve my pager(which was left on the bench), the boys *and* the car were gone.  *shrugs*  Just so long as they leave me alone and don't hurt anyone in the process....

Alright....well, my little experiment worked, so now I'm going to bed.  I'll babble more at you later......when I'm not half asleep.  ;)"

"event","I'm very pleased with Joes idea.  It turned out really well.  We made about $740ish dollars between pit beef and donations.  We even had one guy donate $40.  We were very pleased.  Actually, so pleased we're going to have another one in the not too distant future.  Maybe figure out if we can do one once a month in the summer....now mind you this is all still in the planning stages, but I think it could really work out.  Obviously we won't make the same amount every time, and the donations are not going to be quite as high....but it could still work.

:D

Very pleased indeed."

just thought id include some lyrics, its festive (haha)
""Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck""

Those tire tracks
zigzag your torso like a Devil's self portrait.
The car accident, the skin graft treatment, the flower baskets,
the wincing relatives...

you bid her farewell then got in your car
and that's the last thing that you can recall.
and when they pulled you out
you didn't know your name
exploding semi truck blurred your face with flame...

you met Jane four years ago today
dancing at some vomit-stained frat party.
Her newspaper gown, glowing headline brown, her violent gypsy dance,
her tired underpants...

Love [x9]
rhymes with pity now
Love [x9]
rhymes with sympathy now

Jane let you touch and feel her
she was so free like a pineapple in a tree
You said it's dangerous
to be so intimate
You know it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

Jane said when she laid on her back
the sun hit her body like an ugly landscape.

But some things never get better
like used cars and bad livers.
So you traded her in for a better looking brand.
One with fake porno tits
a pad lock on her lips
disposable tan
biodegradable hands.

Back at the hospital
you got no visitors at all.
She visits you in your sleep, 
but that newspaper gown is always on fire [x2]

She met him a week after you left her
when you tossed out her touch to the garbage collector.
He talked her out of her skirt in his beer-soaked apartment
and then they did all the things
you never said that you wanted.
And the sirens are laughing underneath your skull.
And your thoughts are turning dull, callous and cold.
Yesterday you gave your burden a name. 
Yesterday you gave your burden a face.

But your burden looks an awful lot like her.

Love [x9]
rhymes with pity now
Love [x9]
rhymes with sympathy now

ps- some1 *coughirwincough* is saying this some1 i like likes me, its not true, but *coughirwincough* made up a list haha its funny"

ps- lyrics 2 a good dc4c song..kinda in the valentines day mood, huh?

""All Is Full Of Love""

You'll be given love
You'll be taken care of
You'll be given love
You have to trust it,

Maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at,

Twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you,

All is full of love
you just aint receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love!

All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love
All is full of love"

<img src=""http://www.drwho-dfw.com/images/whologo4-5.jpg"" />
  Doctor Who was originally a science fiction show that ran from the 60's through the 80's. The main character is 'the doctor', a time lord from a planet called galefrey. Time lords have a unique ability that allows them to regenerate/heal themselves if they are mortally wounded. In the process of regeneration, their body will change (this allows the series to go on when an actor leaves). They only have a limited number of regenerations, but they have enough that the doctor is 900 some years old and still young.

6th doctor<img src=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/images/173/sixth_doctor.jpg"" />
  
  The doctor travels space and time in his ship called the TARDIS (time and relative dimensions in space). The tardis is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside, and has a cloaking device that is supposed to make the door fit into whatever place or time it is presently at. However the cloak was damaged and now the tardis always looks like a 1940's police box.

The Doctor almost always travels with a human companion (usually a woman). One of the original companions was named Sarah Jane Smith. 
  In original series, there were other time lords. However, either in the finale, or sometime after, the time lords went to war with a race called the daleks, a species that looks similar to octopi and live inside what look like salt shakers. As a result of the time war, almost all daleks and all time lords but the doctor perished. This period in time was 'time locked' so that no one can attempt to change the outcome.


The New Series
<img src=""http://www.watchingdrwho.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/doctor-who-logo.jpg"" />
The new series starts with Christopher Eccleston as the 9th doctor. He meets up with Rose Tyler, played by Billie Piper, and after a rough start, rose begins to travel with the doctor. Rose leaves at home a mother, Jackie Tyler, and an ex boyfriend Mickey Smith who is still in love with her.
<img src=""http://klti.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/doctor_who.jpg"" /><lj-embed id=""27""/>

During a trip to WWII London, the doctor and rose meet Capt. Jack(John Barrowman), a time agent from the future who is attracted to everyone. This becomes an ongoing joke. <lj-embed id=""28""/>
They meet up with Captain Jack again when they face the daleks at the end of season 1. In order to defeat the daleks, rose looks into the heart of the tardis and somehow becomes all powerful. She uses this power to defeat the daleks and bring a dead Captain Jack to life. Unfortunately, she does not have complete control of the power, so now Captain Jack can't die. (This sparks the darker Doctor Who spinoff, Torchwood, in which Jack leads the Torchwood Institute in Cardiff investigating alien phenomena)

season 2:
Since her new power is killing her, the doctor takes it from her and sacrifices himself. He dies, then regenerates and we meet David Tennant as the 10th doctor. He somehow ends up sword fighting an alien and looses his hand (which he prompty grows back because he still has residual regeneration energy).

Rose continues to travel with the doctor during the second season, and it soon becomes clear the two are in love. In one episode, they meet Sarah Jane Smith by chance in an episode called school reunion (this sparks a childrens spinoff, the Sarah Jane Adventures). 
<lj-embed id=""29""/>
In a two part finale, Rose gets pulled into an alternate universe (where her father is still alive) and is trapped there when the doctor must seal off all universes to defeat a race of androids called cybermen.

<lj-embed id=""26""/>

Season 3:
In season 3, the doctor meets Martha Jones, a medical student training at a hospital that gets taken over by some rhino looking aliens. Martha Travels with the doctor during this season, but chooses to go home at the end of the season because she has fallen in love with the doctor. He is still in love with Rose, and doesn't see her affections.

Season 4 (my favorite season):
<img src=""http://www.tvscoop.tv/who_donna.jpg"">
  In the season 4 opener the doctor meets up with Donna Noble(Catherine Tate). They had met in a previous episode (season 3) but Donna turned down an offer to travel with the doctor. She has since changed her mind and now decides to go with him. She has absolutely no interest in the doctor (romanticly) and makes that very clear right off the bat. <lj-embed id=""30""/>In one of their adventures, they meet the ood who make a prophetic reference to a 'doctor donna'. In another of their adventures they go to a library (planet sized!!!) and meet professor River Song, who apparently knows the doctor in the future, but he hasn't met her yet. <lj-embed id=""31""/>She has never met donna though, which isn't a good sign.In a season long arc, Rose has found a way to get back into this universe and is trying to find the doctor. She appears in most episodes for a few seconds each.

Season 4, two part finale:
  Donna met rose when she found herself in an alternate universe. Rose tells her to warn the doctor the walls of the universe are breaking down. They rush to earth but nothing is wrong, until the earth vanishes. Donna and the doctor have no idea what to do. On earth all the former companions, including rose, are trying to find the doctor because the Daleks are apparently behind everything. They team up to send him a signal that he follows to where the earth and 26 other planets have been taken. The doctor 'finds' rose but gets wounded in the middle of a very romantic run towards her.
  After healing himself, the doctor has a brilliant idea and feeds off the rest of his energy into his extra hand (cut off in season 2). Rose is very happy he is still his hansom self, but the tardis is captured by the daleks, so there is no time for romance. They all walk out of the tardis, except for donna who is trapped. The daleks attemt to destroy the tardis, but donna accidentaly touches the extra hand. This causes a chain reaction and a new doctor (with a human body) grows out of the hand. A little of the doctors mind feeds back into donna, but remains dormant for the time being. The human doctor saves the tardis and they go off to come up with a plan. 
  Meanwhile, some of the previous companions have threatened to blow things up if the daleks don't go away. This makes the doctor sad because he doesn't like fighting, but he seems to have created his own little army. It's all very sappy and emotional.
  New doctor and donna have a very funny argument, then decide its time to go save the real doctor. New doctor rushes out of the tardis with a fancy weapon, but gets stunned. Donna also gets stunned, but this activates the bit of timelord brain she got when new doctor formed. She goes time lord on some controls that just happen to be sitting there and immobilizes the daleks (who are partially robotic). New doctor doesn't know that genocide is bad, so he takes donnas work a step further and destroys all the daleks (bad new doctor! Go to your room!). The two doctor's, donna, rose, and all the other old companions (and roses mom...) pile into the tardis. All the planets except earth have gone back to their places. The doctor expalins how the tardis is supposed to have 6 pilots, and everybody grabs a control to fly planet earth back to the solar system (where the moon is waiting right where is was. arg.). Jack, Sarah Jane, Mickey(roses ex), and Martha all head home.
  The doctor is a jerk and sends Rose back to her alternate universe, but lets her keep the new doctor, who is part human so they can grow old together (awww). New doctor tells her he loves her and they smooch! 
  Back on the tardis, Donna is going crazy with the time lord brain in her head. The doctor has to take away all her memory of him and the tardis or she will die (*tear*). He takes donna back to her mom and grandpa's house. Then he goes back to his tardis, which is very lonely now."

I had to drive up to EL on Tuesday to meet with Dr. Brown. He was 40 min's late, but other than that it was pretty good. I'm going to start working next week.
Wednesday, I had to sit around all morning while the dish guy installed our satellite dish. It took forever, but now I can watch Deadliest Catch, and more importantly, my BSG!! We are still waiting for our modem so we can speed up our internet, but it should come in the next few days.
And as always, California just keeps sounding more and more like where I want to end up after college. It just sounds so happy and awesome. Plus, I bet the CSE jobs out there pay a bundle and a half. Everyone always talks about taking a trip to Europe, but I think California would be a cool vacation too. Maybe if I make enough this summer I will go next spring break. All I know is that I need to at least take a trip there.

I'm going out on the boat this weekend. We are going to Canada. I can't decide whether I should keep up with my 'no drinking EVER' policy or not. I mean, I am legally allowed to drink in Canada, so I could. But I think I may need to keep it up, if only to show my parents that I can stand by my convictions. You would think they would notice, but maybe they wont really see until I turn 21. I don't think they get yet that I understand more than they give me credit for."

"event","Well, I saw Nim's Island Friday night. It was very good. It was definitely a kids movie and they rushed the plot a bit, but it was good none the less. The only complaint I would have is that there was not enough good Jodie moments. The only really great shot, when she wasn't running or screaming, was at the end. I'm not sure I would recommend paying the 7 bucks to see it in the theater, but it is definitely something to be rented when it comes out on DVD. 

I rented Resident Evil: Apocalypse Saturday night. That is the second in the Resident Evil series. I haven't seen the first one, but I did see Extinction, which is number 3. I am working backwards through the series, which normally wouldn't make much sense, but with Resident Evil it is surprisingly easy to follow. So, Apocalypse was excellent. I cannot decide between it and Extinction. They are both very good for zombie movies. I think it is because Milla Jovovich is so good at being badass. If you don't know who she is, go rent The Fifth Element RIGHT NOW!!
Anyway, it was an awesome movie and I can't wait to rent the first one.

I finished the new BSG Episode this afternoon. It was pretty good. I'm kind of mad that they made Tory a Cylon though. She kind of bugs me. And I'm kind of fed up with Gaius Baltar. I wish he weren't such an important part of the plot. They took up valuable Starbuck time with boring crazy people who warship Baltar. Who cares! 
Now, time for a pause for a smile and a sigh to celebrate that Starbuck is finally back. 
... :-)
Maybe now that the best pilot in the fleet is ""alive"" again we can get back to some good toaster hunting."

Second, the fourth and final season of Battlestar Galactica (aka. BSG)starts Friday night, 10pm on the SciFi channel. If you don't get SciFi, watch it online at scifi.com/battlestar.
A fellow livejournal-er, who's blog is on the main page, is taking a poll of why people love BSG. I of course had to make a list, but could only think of a few because just thinking about it makes me too exited to think. Here is what I came up with, edited of course.
Why do I love BSG? 
#1: I must quote, because I can't say it any better than ""KARA. FRACKING. THRACE"". Best viper pilot in the Colonial Fleet who can beat the guys any day of the week. And Katee Sackhoff is just awesome anyway.
#2: Number 3 aka. D'anna Biers aka. ""BEST"" CYLON EVER (see if you can guess what best took the place of when I edited). Lucy Lawless is my favorite person in the world, who incidentally just turned 40 on Saturday. (HAPPY BIRTHDAY LUCY!!)
#3: President (and former teacher, which is sooo cool) Laura Roslin. (Marry McDonnel, you may know her from Dances with Wolves)
#4: Snap zooms make the show look like a documentary and mean the best battle scenes ever shot in the history of scifi.
#5: We get to find out if they make it to earth.
#6: Ok, ok. Six can be on the list. But not because of anything she does. Only because Tricia Helfer is cool. And maybe for that awesome museum fight in season 1.

Thats all I can think of for now. Maybe more later. For now here is a 8 min recap of the first 3 seasons (for those of you who aren't addicted yet) and a promo for the fourth season.

I got my hair cut today. It's not as short as I would have liked, but I like it. 
I'm super bored. I worked on my essay a bit yesterday, but I'm too tired to today. I need to find something to do. Anyone want to hang out? 
27 dresses is still playing at the MJR. I sort of want to see it and I sort of don't. I've been watching a lot of Roswell lately and I'm not sure I'm ready for the new Katherine Heigl. We'll see. My mom wants to go see Vantage Point cuz she thinks Denis Quaid is hot. It looks like it will be really boring, but she keeps asking me to go with her. She also keeps going on and on about George Clooney. I have to go in with her to work on Monday or Tuesday. She wants me to take pictures of her class. That is going to be sooo fun(insert sarcasm here).

Also, it hasn't been quite as bad as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a trip to Disney World, but I've found some things to do that keep me in my room most of the time. For instance, I have decided to execute project ""take back my room"". I have never really liked my room setup very much so I decided to move some stuff around. And I am FINALY decorating my walls. I never got into that whole cutting out magazine pictures and pasting them all over my walls thing. Now (even though its a bit late) I'm having tons of fun with it, though I'm printing pics off the internet onto photo paper(its classier). I've got my desk done already. And with my new room setup, I've got a ton of new, empty wall space. This is gonna be fun."

Now don't get me wrong, I think Leonard Nimoy is a god just like every other blue blooded trekie. But haven't we seen enough of the original crew? Of the 10 movies that are already in existence only one has any reference to Voyager. And that is a 5 second cameo by Kate Mulgrew as the amazing Admiral Janeway. 
Did you understand that hint? Janeway, Captain in the Voyager series, was promoted to Admiral and now outranks Captain Jean-Luc Picard!!!!! She is an admiral, people, not just a captain like old Patrick Stuart. Doesn't that warrent at least one feature film?!
Here are a few other reasons we should have a Voyager movie:
1. It would give Janeway a chance to finally say the words she waited 7 years to say to Chakotay (or 7of9 if you roll that way), ""In the ready room, baby!"".
2. It would give the writers a chance to finish up all those loose ends they didn't have time to cover in the finale because of ""time constraints"".
3. Seven. Thats all I need to say.

Well, thank you for listening to my rant. I guess I will go watch my Voyager DVD's again and try to be content.

 Second, why cant I just be normal. I couldnt even eat my dinner tonight because she was there. What is it about her that makes me freek out. Sometimes I wish I could hate her. Of course that would be imposible. I mean, its her. 
It wasnt like this before Marching Band. That must have been it. That whole freshman looking up to their seniors thing. DARN IT! 
Well, i guess it would have ended up this way no matter what. Even if I had been in a different squad. Life sucks.



Maybe I realy should plot to take over the world. Maybe I would feel better then.....
Im going to go listen to journey now. Or maybe piano man, now that I am in this mood I might as well go with the flow, right?"

"event","So they replaced the circulation computers at work and they didnt have anything to do with the old ones so they just gave me one(no charge)! I tested it out last night and it is a realy good computer. I mean, the hard drive could be bigger, but it has a pentium 4 in it and has 512mb of RAM! That is pretty darn good for a 3 year old computer. So now my parents dont have to buy me a desktop computer for college (that was going to be their graduation present for me). So my dad said that they would buy me a laptop! So now I will have two computers for the price of one!

I realy do not want to go to school tomarow. I dont think I can handle having to do homework knowing that we only have one month left. (And it is one month people, I counted)

"event","My week was very interesting. I got a nosebleed at work on tuesday. It only lasted about a minute though. Then I got a much worse nosebleed on wednsday afternoon. I couldnt get it to stop for about 10 minutes. Then there were two more on thursday and one just now. I am not very happy with my nose right now as you can imagine. 
Besides that my weekend has been pretty good. Went over Jax's fri to work on the project, which is now done! Then went over again saterday with katie and we watched mulan 2. Very good movie by the way. Predictable, but good for a disney sequel. It was alot of fun, although it got me thinking how little we will be albe to do stuff like that when we are all at college next year.

I am rereading the ""his dark materials"" series. I havent read it since like 7th grade but im suprised how much i remember. It is very good. I want to reread all three because they are going to make a movie out of them. I dont think the first movie comes out til 2007, but i dont have anything else to do right now. I dont want to wait till  the last minute then not have time to read them.

Guess thats it for now. bye bye"

"event","I'm depresed today. I wanted to go see Narnia with my mom but she wont go with me. I have been asking her to go with me for  almost 2 weeks and she wont. It just makes me mad. Whenever she wants to do something like this and we dont want to she starts complaining about how we never do anything and stuff like that. But when I want to do something, she keeps blowing me off. It's not even about the movie, I just thought that since she used to teach the books to her class that she would like to see it. I think it is because everything is starting to kick in now that there is only one semester left. I was thinking the other day that with my parents needing a new car, computer, and couch that it would be hard for them to come get me at school alot next year. Plus the gas prices. So then I sort of freeked out about not being able to see them very often. I barely see them now with work and stuff. I almost started screaming last night when my I asked my mom if she wanted to go see Narnia with me today and she blew me off. You would think she would be happy that her teenage daughter wanted to spend time with her, but no. 

I need something to do. I think to much and when I think, I think of crazy stuff like this that ends up making me depressed.
Anyone want to do something so I dont go insane?

I just thought of something. You all must think I am nuts when you read my lj. No wonder I havent had any comments for like a month."

I have to work on my esay. it's almost done. just finishing touches. Mrs. Len gave me my intro back today. She said it was good and that I understood it perfectly. This gave me much needed hope because the first two essays where 60 and 68, so I need a good grade on this one.

"event","I have come to the conclusion that adults are not as smart as they want us to think.For instance:

My sister gets everything she wants. she goes out wiht her friends every weekend. My parents dont want her to be gone every weekend, but she has managed to manipulate them into letting her go every time. This is how I believe it works: My sister asks my mom first. My mom says no because again, she does not want my sister gone every weekend. My sister keeps asking many many times until my mom gets mad and yells at her. My mom then tells my sister to ask my dad because she does not want to deal with my sister any more. (Now to my point) My dad always says yes. He never tells her she can not go. It is my belief that he is afraid of what she will do if she does not get her way(he thinks she will act out and do something crazy like drugs or sex, again just my guess, this has not been proven with actual evidence). Therefore, she gets to go.
When my sister does something wrong, my dad refuses to let my mom punish her. For instance, she got in trouble because she made a My Space and had everything on it(address, name, age, a picure of herself). My mom wanted to ground her because my sister knew she shouldnt have all that kind of stuff up and purposly didnt tell my parents she had made a My Space for this reason. My dad would not let my mom ground my sister, and she got to go to the movies with her friends the same day. My sister knows about this weakness in my dad and uses it to manipulate my parents into geting her way.

Because of this evidence, I am very pissed off right now. My sister is currently at the mall with her friends, while I sit here helping to clean the house for thanksgiving. 
I have not gotten up the courage to confront my parents with this yet, and I am not sure if I should.   I would greatly value any opinions or advice on this subject.    Thank You. 

P.S. To further test my theory, I would like to make plans with my friends(all of you) for a couple of weekends in a row. Do you think this is a good idea? If so, anyone want to get a group together to see RENT and Narnia(when they come out)?"

"event","You know how everyone always says their having a bad day, well im having a bad year. Not the past year, this year starting now. I cant figure out how to balance my homework and practice and work. And im having a sort of relapse of my crazy emotional self. you probubly dont know what i mean. Ok, so for the past 3 years i have been freeking out about having to graduate. Over the summer and the first week of school, i decided that I was ready to go. but now that marching band has gotten serious, ive gone into total, have to constantly stop my self from crying mode. I know its just the fall, but marching band is half over. i dont think i can go through the rest of the year without knowing there is another mb season to look forward to. I want to go back to freshman year. who cares if i had no friends to sit with at lunch, i want to march the billy joel show. I want to march the first move of she's always a woman and step into the hole just before the 50 yard line. I even want to do that stupid kick thing. My squad leader from freshman year lives one block from me and i never see her. it shouldnt bug me that much because she goes to state, but. I am trying to keep thinking about what megan told me last year at festival, but it doesnt help anymore. I  cant feel ""maching band-ish"" like i used to. I feel like i dont care, and i hate it. but obviously i do care if i hate myself for not caring. does that make sense. like right now, we have harper woods in about 4-5 hours, and i'm not freeking. I should be because the people marching around me are ""having trouble"" but it hasnt affected me like it usualy does. 

Ok i think im done now, and i think this counts as babbleing even though it is serious.
!!!WHY IS THERE NO MOOD THING FOR THIS!!!!!"

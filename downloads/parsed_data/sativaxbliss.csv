still working. the pay is good so im set for now. im living with dan and now we got another roomate. things are wierd. its almost scary sometimes. 
i went to jeffs court date on tuesday. he got 16 years. then 10 years of intensive probabtion after he serves his time. it was really sad. 
i bought a new zong yesterday. that was about the highlight of the month.
theres nothing really interesting going on in my life anymore. actually its not like there ever was. my phone is disconnected now. i lost the damn thing so i need to get a new one of those. but for now. its as if im a ghost. i guess thats it for now. dan is taking me to a movie so i gotta get goin.

"event","hello again. its yet again time for one of my pointless post. feel free to move along. 
first i would like to sincerely apologize to anyone that has tried getting ahold of me in the past few weeks and hasnt had any luck. ( mikey ) everything has been so chaotic lately and everything is just a big mess. 
janna and james are moving out on sunday. off to california they go. that leave me and dan there alone. things are about to get interesting. i finally got off my ass and got a job. i work with my mom at a department store and it sucks but they pay me better and i get all the hours i want. the only catch is i have to dress nice. yuck. blah everything is sucking again dammit. anyhow.
jeffs sentencing is october 10th. it was suppose to be yesterday. thank god it got pushed back.. i lost my id. 
by the way i finally got my pictures developed. hopefully ill have a picture up within the month. my parents computer got a virus so its down for a bit. well see what happens. 
thats all my nonsense for now. just thought id let everyone know im still alive. :)"

"event","It seems its time for yet another pointless update.
 Things are.. well.. still just there. Im still jobless. dan the man is supporting me at the moment. its odd. he lives with me now as well. im just beginning to adapt. 
ryan decided that he no longer wanted anything to do with me. its kinda funny cause i had decided that a while ago and it just occurred to him that our friendship was over. 
ive also turned against the evil phone. i make dan take the phone with him. i have no desire to talk to anyone anymore. all my so called friends usually just want something. 
so tonight is the youthbrigade/oxymoron/pistol grip/ belltones show. :( i should be there right now with dan actually but my broke ass has no money and i refuse to make him pay for yet another show. im super bored. i wonder what janna is doing right now. i think its time to return to my oh so boring apartment.

"event","ah.. time for another update. 
fuck im bored.
so lets see what has happened. 
well i lost my job at sam goody (not that i really care) but im kinda screwed now. im not gonna have rent money this month so my roomates boyfriend is moving in and covering my share. me and dan are good if not better then ever. weve been seeing a little more of each other now.. its almost tolerable. we went to see jarrods band play on friday. it was great especially cause i had 2 40s before i got there. they didnt let his band play so it broke out into a little mini riot then the cops came so it was time for gabi to call it a night. 
i also got a letter from jeff. its wierd. hes in maximum prison for at LEAST 10 years. weve been writing back and forth lately. i miss him. 
Ive been so stressed out the last week its feeling good to not really give a fuck. ive been leaving my phone at home lately too cause i have had no desire to speak to anyone. if anyone needs to talk to me they know where i live.
so yea. as my birthday draws nearer and my probation comes to an end im questioning whats keeping me here. janna and james asked me to move back to cali with them. when i sit and think about it the only things keeping me here are my family and dan. still i dont feel ready to leave this hellhole yet.
well i guess thats it for now. back to my boring life of drinking and skating. tahh tahh."

my wrist hurts. i have had 2 main responses to it.. i either look suicidal or like i just got a tattoo.. that one i dont really see but ok.i accidentally put my arm through a window.. (dont ask) and if thats not enough i ate shit on the hot pavement while me and janna went to do some drunken skating. thats always the best though.. then you just cant feel anything when you fall.. you wake up the next morning going.. what the hell was i thinking. its all fun and games though.
man the last two days were a prefect ending to my vacation. i got to hang out with mikey and mike and my daniel... just having fun and doing whatever. all in all i had a good vacation. 
i guess im done babbling now. i gotta try to hook up my parents dvd player for them then i gotta get ready to go back to hell.
have a wonderful monday and a good week."

"event","Well hello and good evening all. I know its been quite a while since ive posted or even read the damn thing. All i do is work but im on vacation for the week so i snuck over to my parents house after dropping the family off (my roommate, her boyfriend, and my ""friend"") mikes still sleeping and i thought id let him get some rest. Im so happy he finally came out to see me. I feel like hes bored out of his mind cause there really isnt alot to do here, the weather sucks and the first few days hes been here i was working all day. So mike when you read this when you get home im sorry if you arent having a good time.
Warped tour was fucking bad. Flogging Molly and Bad Religion made it all worth while. Then seeing Anti-flag, the Casualties, and Nofx again made it an added bonus. even though im broke now and ive already seen all these bands it was still worth waking up in pain this morning. 
Well. I guess this is it for now. I just thought id let everyone know im still alive (somewhat). Have a lovely evening and a great 4th.

im also very un content with almost everything else in my life. im kinda glad to be moving out of phoenix. too many people here who bring me down. 
btw... jeff is out of jail now and hes already begun to look for me. im kinda scared to see him now. im not about to get stuck where i was last year. besides mike came by my work so we hung out on saturday. we went to his apartment ad got some alcohol ( i was already drunk when i got to his place so i was fucked up that night.) then we just talked and drank the rest of the night. hes so much different from all my other asshole guy friends. i think i might actually like this one. so with jeff coming back into my life im afraid everything with mike is gonna get fucked up.
well i guess thats enough of my stupid lame drama.

Mike.. im glad your posting alot now. it gives me more of an inside on what your thinking. i 100% agree with you on your last post. look at myself. im not saying ive lost all faith.. but you shouldnt be forced into beliefs. thats what makes you curious. for some reason i was compelled to go to church today. i spent the whole hour wondering what was going through everyones minds. its amazing how many different facial expressions you see when people are trying to keep from falling asleep.

well .. as for work. it seems to be my only escape from all this fucking drama thats just been cramming itself up my ass. i feel like a royal dick for whats going on with me and john but i blame this all on him. im an attention needing kinda girl and if he cant handle that then fuck him.
ive made in well with the hot guy that works across at the skateshop. we have an understanding with our discount. god damn is he sexi. id adopt his kids.
as for my delinquent friends which jasper doesnt approve of... well they are actually ok right now.with brandon going to jail next week im not seeing as much of him as id like to but ill live. marks been coming around lately but im sure i missed my chance with him since i ditched him for jeff ( yes i am a giant fucking jackass cause look where me and jeff are now)<-speaking of which i saw the other day..  had to leave before i couldnt hold back my urge to punch that stupid tweaker bitch thats got ahold of him.
chris has been around lately too. brandon had the nerve to say ""maybe chris will take you back"" after laughing till i couldnt breathe i got a chance to mudder..maybe if he had something more intelligent to say then ""id let her suck my dick"" then id think about it.
and thus.. the phone rings. god how i hate phones..."

"event","i really like these words and i thought id share. enjoi.


there's a place where everyone can be happy,
it's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world,
it's made of candy canes and planes,
red choo-choo trains and the meanest little boys,
and the most innocent little girls,
and you know,
I wish that I could go there,
it's a road that I have not found,
and I wish you the best of luck dear,
drop a card or letter to my side of town,
'cause there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend,
but baby I'm amazed by the hate that you, can send and you,
painted my entire world but I,
don't have the turpentine to clean
what you have soiled . . .
and I won't forget it
there's a place where everyone can be right,
even though you remain determined to be opposed,
admittance requires no qualifications,
it's where everyone has been and where everybody goes,
so please try not to be impatient,
for we all hate standing in line,
and when the farm is good and bought,
you'll be there without a thought,
and eternity my friend, is a long fucking time. 

brownie points if you can name that song ;)"

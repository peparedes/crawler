Class VII: Elemental Properties
Prof. Gene Litch</b>

Hello once again, class!  Although assigning homework in-class has worked well for the past several weeks, I wanted to send around a quick reminder about proper attire for our lab tomorrow.  As discussed last time, we will be delving more into the physical properties and general reactivity of the elements.  The accompanying lab will in fact be a series of experiments testing the properties of the Alkali Earth Metals (found along the first column - IA - of the <a href=""http://library.tedankara.k12.tr/chemistry/vol1/atomstr/trans50.jpg"">Periodic Table of Elements</a>).  We will examine how each successive element tarnishes in the presence of air and reacts to water in a more violent manner according to their electron configurations.  Thusly, please be sure to wear close-toed shoes to tomorrow's class.

Furthermore, I'd like to extend a welcome to the visiting children at our school and invite them to partake in tomorrow's class.  As you can see from <a href=""http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/modern-atomic-theory/movie/potassium-reac.html"">this video of Potassium reacting with water</a>, it should make for quite an interesting lab."

Class III: Review</b>

Hello, students!  Since classes were canciled last week, we'll be starting our work on the next unit tomorrow.  However, despite that, you still have homework.  You all might be pleased to note that it is.....


Last week's homework!


Meira, Kameko, Myn, and Victor, as the only students who completed the assignment, are all excused from from this week's work obviously (The grades are 100, 100, 100, and 50 respectively.  Victor, you merely gave me the number of electrons rather than their placement.  If you wish to complete the assigment again you may, and I will take your highest score).  In addition, Myn, for completing the extra credit you are also excused from the next two weeks' assignment as well.

Last week's assignment may be found at <a href=""http://orange-electron.livejournal.com/1053.html"">this location</a>, and please have it completed by Sunday.  Percy Rosenberg, I might point out that this is your second week in a row failing to turn in your homework.  While I'm sure that you are a very bright and dilligent student, I wouldn't want to see you fall behind.  Please stop by my office this week so that we can discuss your grade.


((OOC: Seriously, guys, it takes me half an hour + to come up with these things and a long enough explination so that you don't have to do any research ^^;  If noone's going to do them, I'd just as soon stop giving them.))"

Class II: The Atom</b>


Hello again, class!  I am very pleased with your work in last week's lab and thismorning's lesson.  However, Percy Rosenberg, I have still not recieved your homework from last week, so please see me after class.  Furthermore, Andy Black and Merrick, we missed you in class today.  While I'm sure that you're capable of catching up on the material on your own, please consult with one of the other students on what you missed or stop by later today, and try to be present during future lessons if possible.

Following today's lecture, the next round of homework has to do with the structure of the atom (again, for all calculations we will be following the Bohr model rather than the electron cloud model since it is difficult to visualize).  To complete the homework, recall that:

<b>1)</b> The number of electrons in an atom is determined by its number of protons.  This number corresponds to the element's atomic number.  You can determine this by consulting the <a href=""http://library.tedankara.k12.tr/chemistry/vol1/atomstr/trans50.jpg"">periodic table of elements</a>.  For instance, hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of one, and thus one proton and one electron.


<b>2)</b> Electrons are organized around the nucleus of an atom in shells, which correspond to energy levels.  The amount in each shell can be determined by the formula 2n^2 (2 times n to the power of 2) or by consulting the following table:

<table border=3 >
<tr>
<th><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">Shell Number</font></th>
<th><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">Number of Electrons</font></th>

</tr>

<tr>
<td align=center><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">1</font></td>
<td><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">2
</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">2</font></td>
<td><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">8
</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">3</font></td>
<td><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">18
</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">4</font></td>
<td><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">32
</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">5</font></td>
<td><font face=""verdana, geneva, helvetica"" SIZE=""2"">50
</font></td>
</tr>
</table>


<b>3)</b> The number of valence electrons (electrons in the outer shell) in each atom determines how they will combine or bond.  Atoms are most stable when their outermost orbits are filled.  Thus they have a tendancy to attract electrons from other atoms if their own number of valance electrons is just a few shy of the maximum number.  Coversely, they have a tendancy to lose electrons if they posess just one or two valance electrons.  In this type of ionic bonding (we will study covalent bonding in a later lecture), an atom takes or gives up one or more electrons to the other atom, causing them to be positive (+) and negative (-) ions.


<b>4) </b> Electrons are negatively charged.  Thus, losing one would give the atom a positive charge.



Homework due <b>Wednesday</b>: For the following elements, list the atomic number and number of electrons.  Then determine how many electrons will be found in each shell. (Please note that comments will be screened... if you wish to ask a question or leave a comment that does not have to do with homework answers, be sure to do so in a seperate post.)

Lithium (Li)
Magnesium (Mg)
Sulfur (S)
Oxygen (O)
Iodine (I)
Argon (Ar)
Calcium (Ca)


Example:
<img src=""http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/images/atom3.gif"">
A sodium atom with atomic number 11 and 11 electrons.  Its first shell contains two electrons, second contains 8, and third contains 1.  Thus it would give up the electron in its outer shell and become a negative ion.



Extra Credit (which will also be good for one get-out-of-homework-free pass to the first three students):

It turns out the the Bohr Model is not as accurate as it could be.  Since then, a more refined Bohr Model has been developed.  Here we find that each shell does not need to be filled before moving on to the next one.  Furthermore, each energy level (IE the shells that you are used to seeing) is made from a certain number of sub-shells. The sub-shells, which are named s, p, d and f, can each hold only a certain number of electrons. The s sub-shell can only hold 2 electrons, the p sub-shell can hold 6, the d sub-shell can hold 10 and the f sub-shell can hold 14.  When writing this particular form of electron configuration, we follow the method of ""[Shell number/Energy Level][sub-shell] ^[number of electrons in sub-shell]."" A table of such - and how it relates to the earlier Bohr model - can be seen in the following <a href=""http://education.jlab.org/qa/electron_config_04.gif"">example for gold</a>.

For the following elements, read their electron configuration tables and determine the total number of electrons in each energy level/shell as it would relate to the more simplified, older Bohr model.  (For the configuration tables, <a href=""http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/index.html"">open this periodic table</a>, click on each element, and scroll down.)

Class I: An Introduction to the Elements</b>


Hello, future students!  My name is Gene Litch and I'll be (attempting) to teach you chemistry for the next year.  Please be sure to consult this page for references to past and future class topics as well as homework assignments.  I can't seem to get my actual webpage to work properly, and until I get my oldest son to help me, I'm afraid it's a lost cause.  Now that the boring introductions are out of the way, we can move on to the fun stuff.  The second half of your first class will feature a lab, during which we will be adding specific colorants to a contained fire in order to produce a desired chemical reaction.  The result?  Colored fire!  Interesting, no?  To come prepared, please decide which of the reactions you'd like to try for (feel free to mix and match).

The second half of the lab will revolve around the question of how we can determine the identity of an unknown metal of an ionic salt.  Based on what you know the first half of the lab to be, this question shouldn't be too difficult, but for homework, please write a simple step-by-step list of suggestions as to how we will go about solving this question (hint: you can use any objects that might be present in the lab. Beakers, Bunsen Burners, wire loops, etc).




<b>Addition:</b>  Since there seems to be a little confusion going on, I've decided to break the assignment down in a way that might be simpler to understand for those who are a little rusty on their basic sciences.

To put it simply, this lesson serves as an introduction to the elements.  (We will be discussing what the elements are as well as their properties in class, but if you're worried and would like to read ahead, there is some useful introductory information at  http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa060302a.htm as well as a chart of the periodic table of elements at http://chemistry.about.com/library/blper5.htm .  Similar information can also be found in the appendix of your textbook).

Each element has its own unique set of properties (a fact that we will discuss more come classtime).  A great example of this can be seen in the lab experiment that we will preform.  Each element and each compound of elements is unique, and thus produces unique results during a chemical reaction.  Here, we see that adding a certain compound to a flame reacts with the fire in such a way that it turns it a different color (we will also discuss the reasoning behind this come next class).  And concerning the homework problem, think about it this way: concidering that we now know that certain compounds react to flames in certain ways, what is a sound method for determining what an unknown compound might be?  And if you're still confused, feel free to drop by my office!"

"event","Richie from Wales just sent me photos of caravan smashing party last year ,I had used it as a workshop for 8 years but now it  was defunct and due to neighbours moaning about their property values dwindling (ha) because of the leopard skin caravan/workshop . Also i built alovely new workshop, in the way ..... Lots of children ,punk rock and lager , and weapons of minor destruction later and it was reduced to a smoking pile of dead brie. As always  at parties everyone sat in the kitchen drank  and got stoned and were dull and very few ventured to do any smashing except for Jack and Gus and all the streets and liz and Rebeccas kids.

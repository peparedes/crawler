"event","today at 2:30 im going over ellys aunts house. they ahve a pinball amchine and a dog and a dart board and a pool table and stuff like that. im surprised im allowed to go cuz the last 2 times i asked my parents to go places they said no. well i only asked my dad and he said yes....i think i should ask my mom...she better say yes i really wanna go and get out of my house. i think it will b fun.

natalie broke up w/ brett yesterday...but he said that he liked tashina and things like werent really workin out so it was the rite thing to do i guess. but the thing is he couldnt wait 24 hours for a gf. he went and asked tashina out not 15 hours after they broke up. he was like "" you dont understand wat its like to have someonr by ur side and then have them be gone."" and im like well u must not have had a very good relationship for u to not care enough to not be able to wait a day for a gf. and he was sayin how tashina was the only one who really cared and i was like wtf we all care! we are ur friends! but its not like we can go like hugging you and say i believve in u soooooo much brett! all the friggin time! we are ur friends u should just KNOW that we care!!! and he says that she is the only one who cared. i remeber a long time ago that he said he would nvr go out w/ tashina blah blah blah and here he is now askin her out. i think that he knows that tashina is the only one who will say yes. and she will. shes liked him for so much for so long that she would. she told me she had started to like him less but now she is likeing him more. i find it to b a very odd coincidence that chris was cheating on her last nioght. [she said she called is house and his mom said o hes not out w/ u? then wat girl is he with?] odd coincidencve isnt it? i was on the phone w/ brett a cuple minutes ago... THE MOFO HUNG UP ON ME!!!

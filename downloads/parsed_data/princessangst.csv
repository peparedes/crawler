"event","<center>Maybe I didn't love you quite as good as I should have, 
Maybe I didn't hold you quite as often as I could have, 
Little things I should have said and done, 
I just never took the time.

You were always on my mind, 
You were always on my mind.

Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times, 
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine, 
If I made you feel second best, 
I'm sorry, I was blind.

You were always on my mind, 
You were always on my mind,

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died, 
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, 
If I made you feel second best, 
I'm sorry, I was blind.

You were always on my mind, 
You were always on my mind.</center>

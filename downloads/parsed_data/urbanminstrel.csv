"event","The sun is shining and it's freezing cold.
I wear a sweater, and a cardigan, and a jacket.
My mind is sinking, removing me from the scene.
Or the scenes.  All of them.  The lives and the interests and the circles and the offices and the streets and the city.
Talk is so damned cheap, isn't it?
I just don't want to be anywhere anymore."

far from every possibility
of petty panics and pains

Child it's the soil that has always mattered
earth on which your feet find balance
gift of life

Let me climb or sink or fly or swim away

No you are linked by more than obligation

Well then
for a few then
I will stay"

"event","I am so happy that those of my New York peeps who are marriage inclined will now be able to plan fabulous events and commit in a way that is recognized as EQUAL to all heterosexual married couples.  I am truly joyful that they will have the same rights and privileges as a result of their commitment to each other that the union of a woman and a man have brought for centuries.

I believe Governor Cuomo was astute when he said that the most important word is the second word of what we were fighting for:  marriage equality.  Equal rights under the law.  That's what it's all about.

As for marriage?  I'm still scrabbling and scraping my way out of the wrong kind.  Or, you know, the kind the Roman Catholic Church feels will be so ruined by the history made Friday night in Albany.  Nearly there; nearly there.

Happy Pride!"

"event","Oh yes, with loads of extra m's!

What some people choose to do on the internet really disgusts me.  I'm not talking about nekkid pics of Disney starlets past and present.  I'm not talking about XXX sites even.  I am talking about people who have nothing better to do with their time than post private things in public forums.

Yuck.  Gross.  Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  (Yeah, extra w's.  I heart extra letters sometimes because sometimes it seems like the most effective mothod of emphasizing stuff.  Whatever.)

Anyway:  Humans continue to confuse me.  Which is actually fine and cool etc.  There are infinite varieties of them, after all.  I so don't need to have all the answers.  Learning the questions is the delightful part of life for me, anyway.

I am being a tad antisocial of late, and for extremely good reasons.  Apart from a couple of extremely trustworthy and exceptionally proven-over-time friends, I choose not to participate in many things.  I am finding my own route, road, way (yes, again; so?).  And I am smiling through the drudgery and grunge through which I am going; smiling at its necessity and even its textures.

I do so love textures."

whoever thinks whatever
there it is
shining and inevitably
plain
simple
ordinarily extraordinary

I lost sight of it
for a while a while ago
couldn't hear the sound
of my own thoughts
through the cacophony
I allowed to swirl through
my limited understanding

Ah yes
this is really who I am
again
always was
whether or not
coming or going
all facets showing

Back to the green
in my soul
during this season
of death and redemption
I hear my own song
again
and I dance my own dance

It's vast over here.  I started out thinking I knew what I wanted to do here, but that got changed.  Then I changed in some rather significant ways.  Now I'm just not sure whether or how I want to use this space.

Ah well.  If you stop by here, I wish you warmth and happiness, whatever means those things to you."

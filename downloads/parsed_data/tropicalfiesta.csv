"event","Whoa, when was the last time I wrote in this? Sorry for all the people that depend on live journals to entertain theirselves...I forgot about LJ. A LOT of shyt has happened since I've wrote. The summer was the absolute best. I experienced ALOT OF THINGS if you know what I mean! HA! I got back with Marcel recently, but then even more recently broke up with him. I'm single, once again. Marcel's too much of a bestfriend to me, to be a lover.  Theater is the best like usual, Oliver is the play. November 18,19,20,21.  I put up my pimphat...I use to talk to so many men, but I gave that up. I got sick of it THAT quick. All I can say is, since July 24th, I can't get this kid out of my mind. I'm not at liberty to say, for several reasons, whom, but hes the whole package. Bestfriend AND lover. Too bad he's taken... :( Oh well, I guess I'll wait, unless someone of the same ""package"" comes along and sweeps me off my feet into the stars...or not, lets get realistic Jaclyn. This year is going by so fast, and I'm glad. I can't wait till I graduate, and I have a feeling I'm not alone on that one. GUESS WHAT GUYS! IVE BEEN TRYING TO GAIN WEIGHT...AND SINCE I'VE BEEN DRINKING THOSE ""BOOST"" DRINKS 2 WEEKS AGO I GAINED 5 POUNDS. WOOT WOOT FOR ME! Well I'll try to remember to keep posting. Thats all for now."

"event","FRIDAY=Alisha and I finished taping all the footage of our music video! You all know your excited to see it. It will probably be fully finished tuesday. Marissa and I hungout and went to Jehiahs house to chill, then after we hungout with Buddha and Glenn and went to Best Buy which none of us bought anything. That concludes my friday because I went to bed at 8:00 pm.

SATURDAY= I had to beg my dad to let me go to Summer Jams because my cousins graduation party was the same day. Krystal ended up calling him unexpectedly and convincing him. It was suppose to be Krystal,Marissa,Annie, and I in the car, but plans got really messed up and too confusing. Some people wanted to leave later when there would be no good seats and some people wanted to leave early. Krystal and I ended up going without Annie and Marissa because they wanted to go with Mike D and them. We ended up going with Leah,Keristen, and Jennifer Keefer. It was real fun. Thankfully, we went at the time we did because Mobb Deep came on at 3pm. We were just in time for them. The concert was real hype at the beginning but then after Method Man, it got weak. METHOD MAN SANG MY SONG! The Rockawilder. I was all jumpin up and down! lol. After, we decided to go to Belle Isle, which was a bad idea. Traffic up the ass! Trying to get out of downtown was a pain in the ass, it took us an hour to go like 2 miles. Us girls had to lure guys into letting us change lanes it was so pitiful. Finally, we got to Belle Isle and it was SOOOO packed. We would movie 3 inches every minute. But the good thing was, there was brothas to the left, brothas to the right! lol just playing! Jennifer and I were so hungry we ended up asking these guys if we could have some of their food(from barbecuing), and they said YEAH COME GET A BURGER. They were real hospitable and gave us hamburgers,chips, and drinks. We finally got out of belle isle 2 hours later, and I drove everyone home. Since I wasn't ready to go home, I went and chilled over Chris's house and then went to Taco Bell. That was one of the most fun nights I've had in a long time.

SUNDAY= FATHERS DAY! Which means stay home with Daddy and bond!"

Marissa and Annie sure look comfortable over there sleeping, I want to go back to bed! Today, I might go with Annie and Marissa to Glenns party. I don't feel like driving so hopefully I'm getting a ride with Julie. This weekend was ""off the chain"". I have a feeling this summer is going to be HYPE! Tomorrow I start my summer job for the school. Woot woot! Me and Alisha are going to make another unforgetable music video! Jessie Ormbsy..if you're reading this. I now know how you felt. And sorry for looking down on you otherwise.(If you don't know what I mean, I'll tell you next time I talk to you.)"

"event","FRIDAY= Hungout with ChrisP,Jacob,JordanD,Jennifer,Joe, and Irena. We hungout at Chris's and watched movies then left to go to the dollar show. We went at the late night show. Us girls got in, but the boys got carded! AHAHAHAHHAHAH! So we ended up watching the show by ourselves and the guys went home! We seen Dawn Of The Dead. Good movie, but BAD remake. Then we met up with the guys at Chris's again and went to Keefers house. We ended up walking around her neighborhood and some crackhead asked us if we wanted any weed,coke,crack lol. It was hillarious. Then we went back and I saw her brother butt ass naked and LADIES let me tell you, that boy is FOIIIIIINE. Mmm LOL. I could just... lol. I left around 4, and drove jacob home then I went home and went to sleep.

SATURDAY= AWESOME NIGHT. I hungout with Marissa all day then at night Me,Marissa,Annie, and Irena went to Eko. I was SOOOOOOOO weak at the beginning(we got there at like 10). We thought that it was going to be like that all night but 10:30 rolled around at it got hype again. I met this guy, FINALLY a decent guy at the club! And we like danced half the night together. Yes, he was black. But HE COULD DANCE! And he was all poppin his booty...for all of you that know Leon...he had a ""LEON"" booty lol. And he was vibrating and popping and all that other good shit. We exchanged numbers and went back dancing. Hes the first guy that I felt comfortable dancing with that I didn't know. We wouldn't be in the same dance motion, we would be changing and he would follow right with me. I'm glad I met him ha. THEN! After the club, I decided I was going to let people come over. Annie and Marissa were already going to spend the night. But then we invited Jermaine and Emmanuel and his cousins. They all came over and luckily the neighbors didn't see lol because I told them to park down the street and be VERY VERY quiet. So they came over and we all chilled and watched that soft core porn on HBO lol and Bruce Almighty. The end of the night made me kind of upset but for some careful reasons, I don't want to explain it on LJ. But out of the whole night put together I had a blast. I LOVE YOU ANNIE AND MARISSA YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST."

"event","Had my last 2 finals, American Studies and English...which were the easiest. After school, we had rehearsal for the fitsies then I went home. Emmanuel came over and we watched OldSchool and Van Wilder, the funniest movies ever! Then my cousin came by and chilled with us. After she left, I got my fitsie outfit on and left, we picked up Sean and Krystal then went to the fitsies. 
 
The fitsies was ok. It was fun sitting next to Crystal and her sisters. ha, we were screaming. I got one award, Funniest Laugh. HhahhHAHHahahHAHh... After fitsies we went to Coney Island, almost everyone and ate. When driving home, I bumped into Gabes back end, luckily I didn't leave a big dent. Sorry Gabe! The roads were slippery as hell and my brakes skidded and wouldn't stop. Yeah, and then when I went home, they pranked me afterwards saying his mother wanted to talk to me, I was willing to give my next pay check to pay for the damage but she(THEY), wouldn't accept it. I wouldn't have gotten mad I guess if I knew everyone wasn't there and in on it, and then Jacob calling me a bitch afterwards on my voicemail. Oh well, life goes on. I had fun earlier that day so it didn't matter.

Half day was sooo fun! I hungout with Krystal,Brian, and Emmanuel. We went to the mall and were there from like 12 to 5! First of all, it was the best because me and Krystal took a survey and they gave us 15 dollars for doing it! Tyte ass shyt! Another fun festivity was when we were sitting in the display outdoor table thingy, and krystal flipped forward and almost busted her head! It was hillarious!!! Had to be there, had to be there. 

   Then us girls made a bet with the guys...so we tried on bathing suits for them, and they tried on Abercrombie tight gay shirts for us(they are brothas, its torture for them HA) and we got a picture of that shyt! 

    I bought some more filas...they are green,yellow, and white. I bought red laces so I can have the jamaican colors. So now I'm going to be all jamaicaned out! Imma by more jamaican and bob marley shirts i saw next time I go. I also want this NEW Johnny Depp shirt! Its mine bitches!

We all went to the movies and seen Secret Window with sexy Johnny Depp. It went well, besides of the numbness of my butt sitting uncomfortably in the theater. After, we went to Chris's and watched tv. We were all supposedly spending the night, besides Irena. Yes, I was cuddling and such if you haven't heard already. And just to let everyone know, and get this straight...Jacob and I are not together. We are ""talking"" so to speak, but not offically together. I do have feelings for him, but I just think its to soon to make it official.

SATURDAY= Graduation...My cousin and Keir's for Redford Union High School. The ceremony was pretty boring, until Keir walked across stage then Krystals family and I were screaming our heads off(He looked amazingly sexy). After, we all went to Red Lobster, and Krystals uncle(Keirs daddy), paid for us all(12 people), hes a balla! lol The food was delicious, and those bisquits were of course off tha chain like usual. After the resteraunt, we went to Keirs house and we just chilled over there and socialized. When I got home, I called up my homegirl Marissa, and we went to Chris's and we all met up at the park with Jehiah and Winston. We were in our childhood days, playin on the swings, then we went and played some bball. Then we went home.

"event","This weekend I had the house to myself once again. 

FRIDAY=Hungout with Krystal and went to go get a cd player for my car.

SATURDAY= Track meet...which was tiring as hell. I almost threw up during when I was running. Right after the meet me and Krystal left and I took back the cd player because I decided to save my money to get a better one. After, I went home, washed up to get ready to go to the movies with Chris Skupny. We went to AMC 30 which was an awful choice because they are such assholes there and they will card even a 30 year old. We wanted to see Girl Next Door, but since I wasn't 17, we had to go see 13 going on 30, which turned out to be a very cute movie. I had a really fun time with Mr. Skupny because we haven't hungout in a long time. After he dropped me off I got right in my car and drove straight to Marissas. We were calling up people to see if anyone wanted to go to the club with us. Alisha was suppose to go but she had ""other plans""(HAHA ALISHA!). We were already meeting Jehiah,Emmanuel,Jermaine, and Chris P there so we just decided to go alone. When we got there it was packed and all you seen was half naked 14 year olds and rapist looking arab guys. We hungout with Leon for a little, and then finally found the crew. We were all battling in dancing. It was THEE BEST! Then me and Marissa went to go get our freak on on the dance floor. We ended up in the middle of all these chaldean guys and like got sandwiched which was the worst mistake ever. It seemed that Chaldean guys thought dancing with a girl was another way of hitting a girl from the back. THESE GUYS WERE PELVIC THRUSTING YOUR ASS AS HARD AS THEY COULD. One guy banged Marissa so hard that she tripped forward! It was hillarious! Then later on I found out the one guy I was dancing with was a Jacob Shukri look alike :(. Then...this big huge hairy arab man kept trying to dance with me. I'd see him out of the corner of my eye watching my ass and getting ready to pounce and as soon as I'd see him make a step closer I would briskly walk away. Finally, when me and Marissa were about to sandwich a decent chaldean here comes the big arab again so I RAN away and almost tripped off the dance floor lol. I had a lot of fun dancing with Emmanuel and Jehiah! They know how to boogie down! We were all making up these routines and stuff. Marissa danced on stage! She was soo cute! She was all droppin it like its hot. THIS DAY WAS ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE! I need to go to the club more often. FOSHO. We left and got home about 2 and Marissa spent the night.

SUNDAY=Since Marissa spent the night, we spent pretty much the whole day together. We got up and went to KFC, rented VAMPIRES IN BROOKLYN, and went back to my place and watched it. After that, we went to the mall and went ""shopping"", then returned home and made Smoothies and watched more movies. MARISSA! I JUST CANT LOOK AT ANOTHER CHALDEAN BOY AGAIN! LOL! I LOVE YOU GIRL!"

Up the DownStaircase is going to states! We made alternate(6th place), so we get to get that free hotel room playa!
We also placed an At Large Bid, which tries to explain WHY we should still compete(as in if we did good all season). Now since I found out 2 of our multiple people probably won't go, that was an idiot thing to do(At Large). I'm just glad we get that free hotel room and we get to go watch all the multiples. Thats all I want.

THE PLAY: UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE
Well...I guess you can say we are still rehearsing for it..if you call it rehearsing. Its not going to well. Most of us still haven't memorized our lines. Crisis is going on between leads, and the play is like in 2 weeks. Oh by the way, I'm Rachel Gordan in the play. I'm basically a bitch to the teacher all the time. The play is:
THURSDAY, MAY 6
FRIDAY, MAY 7
SATURDAY, MAY 8
7:30pm in the Fitzgerald Auditorium.
ADULT= $5
STUDENT=$3

TODAY
Today was a fun day. We had an assembly with THE ONE MAN VOLLEYBALL TEAM, which was pretty neato. After school, we had a track meet. The boys wooped New Haven, but us girls got whooped by them. Why do we always have track meets on the coldest days? I mean, come on now! After the track meet, me and a whole bunch of people went to the seminar thingy at 7 which was with the volleyball guy again and he went against all the fitz kids there...he still beat us. 

OH AND GUESS WHAT GUYS! I have a new crush! I bet you'll never guess! Here's a hint: He has the most beautiful smile(it makes me want to cream myself ahha)."

"event","I haven't updated this in awhile so I'm going to start off from last weekend. LAST WEEKEND WAS OFF THE CHAIN! My father went away up north so I had the house ALL to myself!

FRIDAY= Julies Bday party. First we went to laser tag. My code name: Bob Marley. It was the funnest thing ever. That was my first time ever playing. And then Marissas car broke down, but I fixed it! Yay me. After that, we went to Mongolian barbecue which was my also first experience. The food was EXCELLENT! I love how YOU get to pick your food. 

SATURDAY= Hungout with Marissa for a little. Then hungout with Krystal, Sean, and *Keir*. It was one of the best times I've had in a LONG time. First, we went to the movies at the Phoenix. We went and seen Kill Bill Volume 2. Keir and I weren't really interested so we snuck into the Punisher(which by the way was AWESOME), and watched towards the end of the movie. Then we went back in Kill Bill. That movie was pretty good but needed more action in my point of view. After the movies we went to Taco Bell then came back to my house to eat it. Keir and I went upstairs and just CUDDLED under my covers. I still kind of like Keir. Its just hes the one guy I feel so comfortable with and someone I don't have to be ""reserved"" around. After we hungout at my house, we drove up to the Butterfly and played some pool. It was fun with just us four but then new visitors came. Then after the butterfly, we just drove around and talked. We were about to go up to another arcade on 8mile, but Krystals mom wanted us to come home.

SUNDAY= Went to a family barbecue, ate, then left. After I left the barbecue, I went straight to Krystals. From there we went to JEEPERS at Northland. That place is the greatest. We were all riding the rides! Then Krystals Uncles wife gave us like so many tokens we never ran out! Me and Keir got so many tickets and I just gave mine to him because there was nothing really there. He ended up with like 2,200 and somethin tickets and bought me a bracelet(the blue and clear one I wear). Its great...so now when someone comments on the bracelet, I reply: ""GURRRLL/BOIII, DIS WAS 200 TICKETS!"" Haha. My boo gamee dis! lol."

Then after we went to his house and chilled and then we went to visit Alayna at her work because she wanted us to come by, dont ask me why lol. After we picked up Marissa and went to his house and played with his little neices. Giles came over then we went and picked up Ken!Ken is officially one of the only guys that can actually tickle me! haha! We were planning on going to the movies with a whole bunch of people but it just ended up being us. We went and seen Bad Santa which was a HILLARIOUS AND AWESOME MOVIE! I was cryin! 
""Deez lipz were on yo wifes pussy last night""
""Fuck me santa! Fuck me santa! Fuck me santa!""
After the movie, we drove off listening to ROCKIN LIKE A HURRICANE lol. And everyone was staring at us...then we seen some fitz fags and threw up obseen gestures at them. Then Chris dropped me and Marissa off. To Chris,Matt,Ken,Marissa...you guys are the best to hangout with!And i bet none of you talk behind eachothers backs. We all need to do something again.Chris, I'm looking forward to your sleepover next weekend! hahah! I hope me and Marissa can go! Woot woot!"

Hungout with Krystal...we were suppose to go see The Passion of Christ with Keir, but her Auntie never showed up to drop him off and never bothered telling us she wasn't coming. So Krystals dad(being the nice dad he is), drove us to the movies to see it...our luck, it was SOLD OUT! Me and Krystal were PISSED! We were so excited to see that movie! We were planning it for the whole week...so we ended up seeing You Got Served. It was an OK movie. The dancing was sweet but the acting sucked.

SATURDAY=
Forensics competition. Up the Down Staircase did not compete but most of us went anyway to show some love and check out the hot theater guys. My sexy Rufio was there, lookin sexy like usual. haha. THE WIZ multiple was sweet as hell, they added some more sweet beats. 
GREAT GATSBY= GIRL FALLING OFF STOOL AND ALMOST BUSTING HER HEAD OPEN
LORD OF THE RINGS= froto hottie,GAY GUY RUNNING INTO THE BLINDS AND MAKING A BIG NOISE
GAY MULTIPLE= GAY MULTIPLE
HOOK=3RD PLACE,SEXY RUFIO
SUICIDE MULTIPLE= SOME COOL ASS PEOPLE, 2ND
USUAL SUSPECTS= GAY RETARDS FROM MY SCHOOL THAT GOT THE GROUPIES BAND FROM FORENSICS COMPETITIONS FOR SOMETHING THE GROOPIES DIDN'T EVEN DO!(didn't make it to semis or finals)
After the competetion most of us went to national coney island, it was pretty fun. Eventhough most of the waitresses were complete bitch-tits, except for our #1 waitress, Bev. After eating, we were driving off and i ran up on the curb into a big pile of rocks. And MY CAR IS STILL OK. We all drove to Chris's house and chilled there...i left early and took Latress home. And I went to bed

SUNDAY=
Went out to eat with a big wad of my family...we went to a Chinese resteraunt. Then after Me, Keir, and Krystal went to go see PASSION OF THE CHRIST! I finally got to see it. It was so depressing. I dont get how people can get pleasure out of torturing someone of your own kind, that didn't even do anything. Your torturing another human being and think its fun. And that movie really shows how all people are sheep and dont have a damn mind of their own. I cried constantly to that movie and I'm not even that religious. It taught me a lot too...if your unsure about god and jesus and what you believe in...that movie might help. It helped me in a way."

I picked up Schmidty and we went and took back the bottles since I wasn't brave enough to do it myself. We earned $15 dollars off of it. Then we went to 7eleven and i drove her home. When I got home Katie(my cousin), came over and picked me up and we went out to eat at Buffalo Wild Wings. The food was delish! Then after we went to the Butterfly(pool hall on Van Dyke), and hungout with Mike,Matt Giles,Buddha,Buddhas cousin,justin,Marissa, and George. It was ok.

So we drove it back to Krystals house...and Keir changed the tire bein the man he is ha. Then FINALLY when we could leave, we were too late for the movie we were going to see. So we had to think of another movie while we took her mom to the grocery stores. Then when we dropped her mom off we drove to the dollar fifty show. And we decided to see STUCK ON YOU(because it was the only thing playing at the time)! It was an OK movie...I wasn't taht much into the movie though, I was a little busy with Keir. HAHAH! Then after the show we went to Mcdonalds, and I drove them home. I got a lot of driving experience today..it was crazy. I dont like driving at night with a lot of people in the car.

For starters I drove to my grandpas house to visit then after that Rob picked Marissa and I up and we went to his little brother Dan's bball game. When we were waiting for the other teams to end, this crippled man in a wheel chair rolled up to marissa and put his little wheel chair in park and sat and STORED(stared) at marissa. We busted out laughing in his face and ran to the vending machines to hide our laughter.The bball game was pretty intense. Me and Marissa were getting all agressive on the bleachers ha. Then after we went to the mall to look for Katie a anniversary present but we were shit out of luck. Me and Marissa just went on our ventures getting hot items lol. Then after our mall adventure we went to Robs house and hungout with his little brother Dan and his friend. It was totally fun dude. Except for the whole ""humpage"". Robs weiner dog, Oscar is the horniest dog I've ever seen. That dog will hump anything in site...especially arms. I think Marissa and OSCAR had something going...he couldn't keep his red rocket off her lol. Then Levi came by and was all trying to toe us. It was pretty crazy but it was really fun. I miss the good old days when we would all hangout. Well thats all for my Valentines Day...I was a little dissapointed because of not getting candy hearts. My dad went to two stores and didn't find any...then when Rob went to the store to get pop he looked for some and he couldn't find any. Dan had some and he generously gave me some. But I want some of my own, ya know? Valentines Day isn't a special day for me without those mouth watering candy hearts. So if you see any and feel generous, I would appreciate it so much if you donated me some. Thanks. HOPE YOU ALL HAD A HAPPY VALENTINES DAY! I KNOW I DID.

U KNOW I WAS LOOKIN SWEET WITH THAT IVERSON JERSEY HAHA. I hungout with Krystal at her house afterschool then Katie came and picked me up and we rented uptown girls! it was a pretty sweet movie. That little girl is unbelievable. She can act her little butt off!

TODAY-Today after school was one of the best days of my life...my dad let me drive by myself! Ok here's the story...
I asked my dad if I could drive around the block to show him I could drive by myself...so he let me. Then I came back unscratched and no dents. And I asked him if I could drive to the game because if I didn't I would have no ride and I'd have to go with Marissa at 4:30. And of course he said NO...then I begged him a little more and he said YES. Right when he said that beautiful glorious word I ran to the phone to call Marissa and tell her the fabulous news...then my dad screams out ""NO NEVERMIND! NEXT TIME JACLYN! NEXT TIME!"" I was like WHAT THE FFFFF!""DADDD WHY YOU GOTTA DO THAT TO ME? WHY YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY EMOTIONS LIKE THAT?"" And then he finally said ""OK FIIIINE!"" And i jumped on him and threw kisses at him and replied ""Is that your final answer? Are you sure this time?"" And he said ""Yes!""
Then I called Krystal and told her my dad is letting me drive to the game(at this time she was still at the school for her band sectional) and she asked me if I could pick her up and take her home. So I did and we were on our way to her house and her mom called and we told her mom that I was driving her home and she asked if I could take her to the store and of course I did, lol. Then after that Krystal wanted to go to the game and her mom wouldn't let her go without Keir going, so Keir and Auntie Tonya was on the way to her house and we convinced Keir to come to the game. So we got to drive to the game. The game was fun, both jv and varisty won. Then after we went to Krystals and watched Disfunctional Family with Eddie Griffith. That was a Hillarious comedy show! Thats all for today folks.

After that I went to pick up my grandma and me,my dad, and my uncle took her out for Chinese Food. And then we went and looked at my uncles new house. Then I got home and somewhat bonded with my father by watching Old School. Which was an awesome movie when you watch it the second time. The first time I wasn't that much into it, but when i watched it the second time it was HOOLARIOUS! Then I talked to Marcel all night. Thats all I have to say.

"event","Yesterday(Saturday), was a tragic but then later fun day. In the morning I took my roadtest...failed because of blowing through a yield sign. The man was a absolute dick! He was this greasy-haired,rapist looking, one pinky man that was rude and scary. My eyes were watering after he told me that...and then he said ""Oh! USUALLY I make people wait a week to take it over but since you only did that one thing incorrectly, I'll let you take it tomorrow"" So i scheduled taking it the next day. I was depressed after that, until I talked to my buddies Marissa,Krystal, and Marcel(each seperately but all cheered me up). And then my cousin Katie came over to do my hair for the dance. And marissa came to because she wanted her hair done. Then Katie got the crazy idea of doing my makeup. I NEVER WEAR MAKEUP! EVER! But she talked me into letting her do it. And I guess it turned out good. Marissa and Katie said I looked hot and they started singing Britney Spears- I'm not a girl, not yet a woman. lol
Then me and marissa picked up Krystal,Keristen, and Nicole to go to the dance. We arrived and it was more fun then we thought it would be. They played good music, they played MIXES! WOOT WOOT! And we danced up on some foiiine hunnies. It was really fun. I was dancin all crazy and being myself and I wasn't embarassed at all. EXCEPT for when Krystal and Keristen told this guy that I thought was hott that i wanted to dance with him. I ran into the bathroom hiding in a stall and Schmiddy was all pulling me out trying to force me to go out there! I felt like one of those ugly girls that cry at every dance they go to because they have no guy to dance with and they get their friends to ask guys to dance with them! They made me feel so retarded lol! But finally I went out there and I danced with him for like a second. Krystal said that he said he thinks I'm cool(me and him talked before in school and at bball games) and he wants to get to know me. lol. So thats a +++. Then after all that fun dancing...we went out to eat at BIG BOYS! And they took like 45 minutes to make our food. Krystal ordered a damn salad...how long does it take to make a salad? And i got a slab of chicken? Come on now! But we finally got our food, we ate it, then we went home. On the way to the car...Krystal  all of a sudden got a charley horse in both her legs and clenched onto me for dear life and like almost fractured my hand with her damn nails! lol. Then out of nowhere Keristen started throwing up in the parking lot and complaining of food poisoning and telling us to stop making her laugh! lol! It was a crazy night and I had fun."

We went to Bible Study...but sat in the parking lot for awhile but then left since noone was there. Then we went to Sean's house for like a second  but we like stayed in the car while and we were talking to Sean outside the car. Then Sean's cousin Taiwan wanted to ""holla"" at me, so I went outside and met him. We talked for about 20 seconds...then i said it was cold and went back inside the car. We left, and went to Krystals house and just chilled there and watched Smallville and the rest of American Idol.
         Today, nothing exciting happened. Went to school...dentist...KFC...and here I am. I know that I said I like being single...but now I'm getting the feeling of lonliness :(, I miss cuddling with someone.(sniff sniff) I need to meet more guys."

   SuperBowl Sunday was pretty fun...hungout with my dad till Marissa came over and all these 40 year old men came to my house because my dad was having a party...so me and marissa split and Gabe picked us up to go to Chris Ps party. It was a blast. Me,Marissa,Gabe,Chris,Ken,Jacob,PamP,Frank,Biezck were there. We watched the game and hungout and talked. Chris, your my best guy friend. I can talk to you about anything. I'm always here for you buddy when you need me. Love ya!
   Monday...what can I say, it was a Monday. I watched the movie volcano when I got home and just moped around the house because I have a cold...and I talked to Marcel on the phone most of the night
   Tuesday...today...went to school...worked on skits for the COMEDY SHOW in theater...my dad picked me up...I practiced driving...we went to Red Lobster...we came home...my grandpa came over and visited and told me more interesting stories and gave me long lectures as usual about things I already know...and started writing you people. I have a really bad runny nose and will not stop RUNNING! And when I do blow my nose it doesn't do any good because my nose is still stuffed up! AhhHhH! I want someone to cuddle with...I feel lonely. 
  Hope I got you all up to speed."

And we were about to go on WITHOUT her which wasn't possible because all of her lines flow into ours. But being the forensics lover she is, she showed up just in time and saved the day, eventhough we got 8th place out of 10. But HEY, its better then 10th, and remember fitz...were in it for the free hotel room. Ford High School is the best! Suicide and Hook multiple are the coolest dudes ever! Yay yaeee! I want to bang Rufio till the break of dawn, he has it going on. MMm ha! Lets hope next time I actually talk to him. Today was a fun day. Forensics people are the greatest...well some of them. Oh and a little note to all you forensicators...dont wear white socks with black shoes and pants...I did.lol Its ""distracting"". Hahahah!Well thats all I have to say for today.

"event","Today was a fun-filled/exhausting day. Well we had forensics today during class and we designed our HOODIES. They are going to say: Were in it for the free hotel room...it better have a pool. < Because if we make it to state competetion we get a free hotel room because its a two day competetion. Great ay? So we rehearsed then afterschool we rehearsed some more. But THEN...since we didn't have matching shirts(for the students in the multiple) we had to go buy matching ones. Eventhough Ms Kelter said SHE'D buy us our shirts...she didn't. So in that case Corbin gave us some money and Gabe,Pam, and I went out on a hunt for matching dress shirts, and when i say HUNT i mean hunt! We went to 7 different stores to find those biotches! Burlers,family dollar,thrift store,value world,Kmart,walmart, and Men's Warehouse! We dropped off Pam at 4:30 then kept searching and finally struck gold at Walmart, our last place. Then Gabe dropped me off and went to Men's Warehouse to get his shirt. 
   Then when I got home I cleaned up a little,ate, then my Katie picked me up and we went to the BBall game. We showed up at Varisty's halftime. And I sat with Sean,Daniel,Keristen and some other people I don't know. After the game, it was Me,MikeD,Justin,Brendon, and Katie in Katies car. We went to Giles house because Mike left his coat in his car. Then they dropped me off at home to go pick up Glenn and go to Nationals. Thats all folks! 
    Tomorrow I have another exhausting day at my Forensics competetion. I have to be at the school at 6:30 in the morning! ahhhhhhh! And be there till about 6:30pm at night! BUT i get to see RUFIO from Hook again! MmmMm SEXY SEXY! HAHAHA. Well nitey nite yall. Good luck BOTH multiples at tomorrow's competetion! Love you!"

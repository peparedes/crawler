i got outta school the 8th ... and summer is goin fabulously. i love summer ... especially since this one means i dont hafta go back to OLV. gawd that school is hell.

alright, i know this girl .... and we are soooo much alike that its scary .. we read eachothers minds and say the same things at the same time. lol its great. she knows exactly how i feel and is in a lot of the same positions as me.... plus she is a cheerleader .. so we get along fabulously. we talk for hours on end, sometimes about stupid random stuff but its still fun. well its just nice to know that the world isnt completely filled only with 13 and 14 year old bitches who think they are hot shit. yeah there are lots of awesome poeple out there and some people just need to open their eyes and realize that.

hhmmm what else? oh Wizard of OZ was great. Hillary, Joanna, Kevin ... and all those poeple were very good, i love ya'll

i can't wait until VMS .... next month ... its gonna be such an awesome time ... back with the family ...... it will all come together .. we will all come together, i know it, it always does and it just has to.


Our Dance recital is this Saturday .. im excited, but nervous, this someone is gonna try to be there. but then right after dance i leave for Cape Cod and wont be back until the 30th. that should be a fun time tho since im going with meg, ry, laurie, and tony. should get alot of sun ..

omg i saw Pearl Harbor Monday night ... best movie ever .. i balled ... but it was worth it, it was a great movie .. and eventhough people said it gets too long and gets boring ... well it really doesnt, everything fits perfectly and i loved it."

"event","err i hate this! not being able to talk to your best friend!ah i need to talk to her so bad right now! too many decisions!!! it sux. i dont know what happened, i didnt mean to make her mad, i had just been a little upset and maybe dissapointed that she couldnt be there. and then i was upset that she lied to me but i dunno. i mean you can just tell me if you already had plans or was asked to do something better ... i would have liked that a lot more than lieing to me. and wow has that conversation changed a lot, for me anyways. she barely even looks at me anymore let alone talk to me. i hate it .... watching your best friend slip away is extremely difficult and i just dont know what to do"

"event","ok the *Nsync concert was friday night and omg was it ever a hell of a concert!! it was amazing.  the best concert i have ever been too. the guys were spectacular, hotter than ever! and they were soo cute dancing and fooling around on the stage, which was huge! they flew over the middle onto a second stage on the fifty yard line and i got some really good pictures of that. they got so close to us in the middle, gawd they are so gorgeous. they were so cute when they brought out all the toys and were fooling around ... and omg the mechanical bulls .. aaahhh ride those bulls guys!! and the ""nintendo game"" thing, that was great. and omg that part in black and white when that stupid girl made justin sad and his eyes were so sad and he looked so adorable and that bitch turned him down ... omg it made me want to cry, and he sang a song about how she was gone and the guys tried to cheer him up and aahhh, amazing. and then chris, hahah hes hilarious he was walking around stage like he was drunk or something! he did a flip and was wobblin all over stage and ah, another cutie! they just are amazing, nothing can top them, they work so hard and it must pay off, the fans love them, they are great. the new songs they sang from their new album were unbelievably great! i can't wait til the album comes out on July 24!! I'm gonna go stand outside like 3 hours before the place opens to guarantee i'll get it because i just hafta, they are amazing songs and extremely talented guys.  me, alison, stephanie, kimmy, kate, rose, and jessie gave a note with our name numbers and screen names to a girl with a backstage pass and she said she would give it to the guys, that would be awesome. and when we were waiting in line to get in .. guess who rode right by us on their motorcycles!!!!!? JUSTIN AND CHRIS!! mmhhmm they did. and my sister sarah got Justin's cracker jax and chewed gum!! they are in my house!! aaahhh. cuz her boyfriend pat met justin at a red sox game while *Nsync  was staying in boston for the Foxboro shows. i wish i had been there to meet him, i couldnt have asked for more. i wish that night could never have ended, it made me so happy when they came out on that stage the very first time, my heart was beating so fast, those guys are amazing and i love them and their music with all my heart and soul.

Thank you mom for paying all that extra money for me!! i love you!

omg and a special shout out to our awesome limo driver JOE!! he was wicked great!! he let us do whatever the hell we wanted and he was wicked fun!! thank gawd we got him and not some old guy, joe's wicked young and hes hilarious. Joe: oh do behave!! hahahaha Price check on the purple bear!! lol THANKS JOE!!"

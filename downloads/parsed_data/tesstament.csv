"event","A long time ago, during the last darkness, I followed the big human up the hill and into the place with the delicious flowing water that's heaven to drink. But unlike the other times, I couldn't get out of that place, and the big one grabbed me and put me in the flowing water place and there was all this gross oozing stuff all over me, and I tried to get out of what I now think is the evil waterfall, but I couldn't. I only felt that oozing-ness once before, so long ago, it's like a bad dream. After the big one took me out, I tried again to get out of that evil place, but then came the wind. At first it was a warm wind, but at the same time, loud and frightening, like a storm (maybe). And then the big one covered me in a fur, and I felt like I did when I was just a little girl, and I was happy again."

"event","well, <lj user=""chrismaverick""> and <lj user=""beststephi""> seem to be back home from Europe (where they went without me, the bastards), and somehow the house just seems a little smaller. It was quiet around here the last week or so with me and <lj user=""ottobiography""> having the house to ourselves. I guess I have to thank <lj user=""max1975""> for coming by and visiting a couple of times and being nice enough to bring food and drinks with him.

I'm bored... I think I'll go hang out with <lj user=""beststephi"">."

"event","everyone is being boring today. <lj user=""sui66iy""> isn't here, and <lj user=""chrismaverick"">, <lj user=""beststephi""> and <lj user=""thehammer""> are all just sitting around using their computers. No one wants to hang out and play. I guess I could go tease <lj user=""ottobiography""> but that gets old eventually. I think I'll just go cuddle with <lj user=""chrismaverick""> and maybe he'll eventually get the idea and put his laptop away."

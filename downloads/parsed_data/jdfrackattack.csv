"event","LOS ANGELES, United States (AFP) - Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter has dismissed press reports that he and Chinese superstar Bai Ling were poised to marry, saying he was enjoying being single. 

The 25-year-old boy band heartthrob called in to a radio talk show in Los Angeles to quash rumours that was ready to tie the knot with the sexy actress who is ten years his senior.

""We are just friends and I'm dating, but would love to meet a great girl that has her life in order and understands my career goals,"" he told talk show host Ryan Seacrest in an interview from Spain where Carter is on tour.

The denial came four days after a newspaper in Hong Kong quoted Bai Ling as saying she was in love with Carter and that the two of them were engaged to wed.

""A representative from Bai Ling's camp informed Carter's rep that she never said the things that were reported,"" read a statement issued by Carter's publicist Juliette Harris.

""Carter and Ling are just friends and Nick is dating and most recently he has been linked with a sexy singer from the Atomic Kittens while on his European tour,"" the statement added.

Hong Kong's Apple Daily quoted the 35-year-old Chinese actress as saying she had been seeing Carter since they met recently in a charity event in Malaysia and were ready to wed anytime.

Bai Ling said Carter, who ended a brief romance with hotel heiress and Hollywood it girl     Paris Hilton last year, got her phone number through Ling's friends. They met -- and fell in love.

""My current boyfriend is a godsend. I didn't need any reasons to like him and I am willing to do anything for him,"" said the Hollywood-based star of ""Anna and the King"" and horror flick ""Dumplings.""

""We are very romantic. To meet someone like that, I have to give my love to him and I do really love him,"" she was quoted saying."

"event","Okay, so I went to the game yesterday and although I know that I was supposed to be watching the Vikings (and I did) but I also watched the ass of a VERY FINE rookie on the Chief's sideline.  Seriously, I totally call this guy!  James Kilian the rookie QB, so years from now when every girl (and guy) is sweet on him I can say that I loved him since his very first pre-season game, so there.  I so very wish that his photos looked anything like him in real life. ~sigh~"

"event","So my sister gets really cool seats to sporting events from her work and we took Ren to a front-row-behind-home-plate Twins game a while ago but my sister's husband get tickets too plus some to the theater through his boss.  I'm going to the Viking's Football Game on Friday! Right on the 50 yard line, and I mean directly on the 50.  And guess what, they are 1st row! Too bad it's just the preseason."

"event","Since the last time I have posted I have felt that my LJ has been invaded at least three times, twice in the last two days.  The prospect that there may be more makes me nervous.  I vowed that I would never make my LJ 'friends only' for I thought that any one who found my life and inspirations even remotely interesting should have a good read.  However, up until this point, I had no contacts from my personal life that I didn't want to have access to my LJ, actually read it.  So with this new developement, I feel the need to make it 'friends only' so I know that the three new readers and possibly more... ~shudders~... don't know every personal detail. Life is to short for me to have to worry about who is reading my LJ.  I need all my nerves. If you feel like you want or deserve access, leave a comment or add me to your friends list and we'll get it all squared away.  Thanks so much...

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;d like you to know I&#39;m a real person. I don&#39;t always update frequently, but every once in a while I pop in and blurb about life happenings. Sometimes in a string of updates, sometimes small bursts. Feel free to read them if you&#39;d like?I know I sometimes make comments on communities, some of which I forget whether I&#39;m just watching or am actually a member of lol So as not to alarm anyone, rest assured that I am not some malevolent, randomositous piece of internetery. Just a regular, randomositous piece of internetery. 

Enjoy your day =)"

"event","<p>This month, in great detail

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! This month is ONLY 3 days in lololololololololololololololololololol!!!! Let&#39;s see what&#39;s happened so far (because my life is SO eventful. Actually, October was poppin a little bit now that I think about it. But still!):

11/1-Worked
11/2-Didn&#39;t work. Slept most of the day thanks to mix of tired/period fun times/anemic fun times. Got my hair relaxed and had an epic shower concert as usual. Playlist was A Perfect Circle, &#39;Passenger&#39;~Deftones w/Maynard James Keenan (his voice is addictive. This song is addictive. There was a concert this past weekend in AZ with Tool, Puscifer, and Deftones. I&#39;m hoping Maynard and Chino didn&#39;t let me down and took the opportunity to perform this song live! Or maybe not so I don&#39;t have to be further salty for not being able to go and missing it lol), <span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">10 Years, and System of a Down. Because why listen to new music, amirite?! Also watched some of the show &#39;Alphas&#39; because of my sister, and finally checked out One Punch Man. I actually miss Alphas, and I almost died laughing at OPM and its OTT-ness.
11/3- Today, ta-da! I attempted to go to bed around...3? 4? Realized I wasn&#39;t sleepy, and, well...here I am!

Exciting stuff it is, yeah?! Except not.</span>

"event","Something I regret, hmm...*ponders* Something I regret? Actually, I feel like a cheater with this one. I don&#39;t really regret anything. Or at least I try not to. I try to be certain of my decisions and actions and accepting of the consequences-good/bad, positive/negative, better/worse, helpful/hurtful. I don&#39;t want to look back and wish I had or hadn&#39;t done something. So I don&#39;t. Its in the past, you can&#39;t change it, and its not gonna do any good to harp on and on over it. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m perfect, or that I&#39;m perfect in ensuring that I don&#39;t regret something. Maybe, maybe, maaaayyyybeeee if I think hard enough&nbsp;I&#39;d probably find something-or some things-to regret. But I don &#39;t have time to waste regretting. I could spend that time choosing to do stuff, or not.

I feel like I haven&#39;t explained this well enough to convey what I mean. I may come back and amend it if I ever find the proper words/ways to describe it. Until then I guess this will suffice."

"event","I love how I started this 30 days thing September of <i>last</i> year. Also that at some point I started this particular post (I&#39;m guessing March/April-ish? since that was my last update), and its been waiting for me in draft since then aha<br /><br />Anyhow, carrying on...<br /><br />Your favorite birthday, in great detail<br /><br /><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; WELL</i>, we all probably know? by now that I have a problem choosing unless I <i>absolutely</i> HAVE to, so it might be a couple of birthdays instead of just one lol (my journal, my rules, especially since there weren&#39;t any that specified we had to pick just one. Look at me breaking rules and shit lol)<br />&nbsp;The first one that comes to mind is what I like to call my water birthday. I think I was about somewhere between 11 and 13? I dunno. Old people can&#39;t remember these things dammit! Anyway, pretty much everything involved water, but it all wasn&#39;t necessarily fun stuff. I took a bath, washed the dishes, and went to the beach with with my adult cousin and her kids. Like I said, not all fun stuff, but I like being around water-it makes me happy, its exciting and fun, and I guess maybe I feel wild, free, and at peace! (I surprised I never took up any water-based activities. Maybe in my retired life? Hopefully I think about it before then lol), so even though some stuff was mundane, all I saw was that it involved water. I learned to appreciate the little things a LONG time ago. The beach was the best part though because it was unexpected and totally unplanned. My cousin just showed up and I went to the beach with them! I don&#39;t even know why it was just me in particular, I didn&#39;t fully fully care though, I was going to the beach dangit! I remember being in the car and singing Blues Traveler, prolly &#39;cause it was a pseudo contest with me &amp; my young cuzo&#39;s friend who came with us as far as who knew more lyrics. Why do kids do stupid shit like this?! We did anyway. I came back home all tired and tanned and probably with wild hair-I never come back with regular hair whenever water&#39;s involved!, and peaceful. I think I loved this aspect so much that now even as an adult I always wanna go to a water park at least-I&#39;ve been almost dying to go to Wet N Wild for my birthday, but being that its still freaking winter most of them are freaking closed! =( That&#39;s okay though. My uncle told me that Sea World is open then so I&#39;m slightly/pseudo planning to go there next year! Water AND dolphins?!?! Fuck motherfuck yeah!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Another one was my 21st birthday, not because it was particularly memorable, but because I was in Wal-Mart around midnight pretending I was Spider-Man, my sister bought me a Blue&#39;s Clues beach towel, then later at home I tied the towel around my neck and ran around the house in my underwear making Freakazoid noises and pretending to be a superhero aha!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Continuing with chronology, my other stand out favorite birthday was my 22nd birthday. INCUBUS CONCERT...ON MY FUCKING BIRTHDAY!!! I didn&#39;t give a damn that it was in Colorado, this had to happen! I started planning that shit in November the previous year. Pre-ordered Light Grenades to get tix early, looked up the venue, hotels, air fare, potential stuff to do, I was all set! I&#39;d never flown before, and I don&#39;t exactly like heights, but I was still open to the new experience and a new adventure. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to sleep even though its one of my favorite things &#39;cause I&#39;d be so nervous! Got on the plane and slept like it was NOTHIN! Plus, Incubus on my birthday so bring on the new experience! I considered it a present from the band even if they didn&#39;t know about it lol I had 2 tickets but couldn&#39;t find anybody to go with me so I went alone. The whold thing was actually a huge accomplishment for me because I did things I&#39;d never done before or probably wouldn&#39;t do under normal circumstances. (Believe it or not, I have it in me! I tend to be consistent overall, but ever so often I break out and do something unexpected that people don&#39;t know that I&#39;m capable of until I do it. After that, then they might second guess whether to put it past me or not lol) It was an interesting venture. I slightly fell in love with Denver &#39;cause the smell of the cold and how calm and serene it seemed. And the snow! It didn&#39;t snow while I was there, but there was snow. It actually stormed really bad there a bit after I left =S And Denver&#39;s fucking huge. And I don&#39;t really like big cities. While I probably wouldn&#39;t live there-I&#39;ve been spoiled by Florida weather (hurricanes I&#39;m used to, all the work you have to put in dealing with snow and potential blizzards and shit?! Nah, I&#39;m good), I could see myself visiting often enough to be mistaken for a resident. Got lots of phone calls wishing me Happy Birthday and to be safe and all from everybody back home. They didn&#39;t realise the time difference &#39;cause while it was 8/9am here, it was like 5/6am there and I was dammit sleepin! &nbsp;I didn&#39;t do much &#39;cause I was only there a day, but I did attempt to venture out to get a tattoo during the early part of my birthday. Then it was conert time! Somehow on the way to my show, my cab driver ended up getting my second ticket and going to the show with me o.O I call him my creepy cab driver &#39;cause he was totally trying to mack up on me, but I wasn&#39;t interested. He checked in our stuff at the venue, then he practically wouldn&#39;t leave my side! I kept trying to move away but he kept moving with me, reeeeaaallly close! I think Ben Kweller opened-cab driver didn&#39;t even know who he was, nor who Incubus was &#39;cause he asked me if Kweller was them! (You tryin to mack up on me and I&#39;m not interested AND you don&#39;t know who Incubus is?!?! The fuck outta here! *punts*) When Incubus did come out the crowd practically lurched forward, and I used that as my chance to get away from my creepy cab driver. Show was awesome! I wasn&#39;t right up front, but I was still close enough. Plus it was a small venue, so close enough still sufficed. Took pics &amp; vids, got tossed around by the crowd, sang my heart out, and they played like a tropical-esque version of &#39;Redefine&#39;!! S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is one of my favorite albums and they hardly play anything from it live anymore (only recently they&#39;ve started a bit more. I&#39;m still waiting on witnessing &#39;Crowded Elevator&#39; live and in the flesh. I&#39;d probably cry uncontrollably for extra reasons I wouldn&#39;t wanna explain to whoever was with me.). So so sooooooo glad I decided to do that birthday show! Best decision I&#39;ve ever made in my life thus far! I lost my cell phone while being jostled around, my cab driver checked my jacket out then left me, I was in a huge city all alone and knew no one so I wasn&#39;t exactly sure how I&#39;d get back to my hotel-I was slightly worried but I still tried to meet the band after the show lol And I bought a tour shirt since it commemorated my birthday and this glorious event! I had to! Did find my phone before I left, then my cab driver (remembered my room at my hotel O.O You best believe my door wasn&#39;t open wider than 2 inches talkin to him!) brought my jacket back (less O.O but still) and wanted to have breakfast with me (O.O!!!! Bitch, you took my jacket last night, left me, and then creeptastically remembered where I was staying after picking me up once. I question whether I&#39;ll live after having breakfast with yo ass! I&#39;ll pass and choose life, shoot.). Just my luck to attract the slightly obsessive ones (there was another guy back when I was like 16 or 17; another story for another day?). Thankfully he wasn&#39;t the one who took me to the airport when it was time to leave! I almost missed my flight to Dallas &#39;cause I&#39;m such a noob at flying and I waited for my luggage even though I checked it in and it was being flown back home separately. Made it by the skin of my teeth to my flight, then I was on my way home.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Last but not least, my 23rd birthday I made my fam go to Busch Gardens. We got there around 1, which is kinda late, but we made the best of it. The park was kinda slow so we were able to go on a bunch of rides with no problem. We went on the white water rapids one ride &#39;cause I like water and I wanted to get wet! After our first time around when we were coming back, the person facilitating entering &amp; exiting the ride asked if we wanted to go again. I shouted yeah and some of the others did too, so we went again! I barely got splashed the first time while others were semi-soaked, but I made them go again with me. Second time still nothing! When we got back around the person asked if we wanted to go again. There was a mix of moans and groans and me being all like &#39;Yeah! 3 for 23!&#39;. Then I had them chanting &#39;3 for 23&#39; and trapped them for a 3rd go round. I SWITCHED SEATS with my cousin who kept getting wet and some of the other wet ones moved so they wouldn&#39;t get more wet, but they STILL got majorly wet up! Even though I got more water the last time around, I still made it off the ride being the driest of us all! Now everytime we talk about it we call it &#39;3 for 23&#39; lol<br /><br />Okay, enough birthday chat. Avert thine eyes and rest my friend. I think I&#39;ll take my own advice as well. Until next time...<br /><br /><br />"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;So we finally found out what the gender of the baby is. Bro &amp; gf are having a girl! I wanted them to have a boy (but then again until I have kids I vicariously want everybody who's having a kid to have a boy lol), I was looking forward to a lil nephew, shoot. Everybody else wanted them to have a girl, they really wanted a girl (why everybody like girls so much?!). At first the docs told her it might be a girl, but they weren't sure so they had to do another test. I kept teasing saying it was a boy 'cause I knew everybody wanted it to be a girl and I'm mean. I'm glad that they did luck up and have a girl just like they wanted tho! I told them I'm still gonna buy her robots and dinosaurs even if I have to mod boy clothes and they're cool with it. Then again they also don't mind me getting skull/dark/geeky stuff for her 'cause they like those things also, so I know the other stuff wouldn't have been a problem lol&nbsp;
&nbsp;Its gonna be weird kinda being an aunt. I'm used to dealing with babies and kids, but so far they've just been little cousins. Hell out of all my g-ma's grands my sisters and I helped raise a majority of the younger set just about! This'll still be somebody else's kid, but I'll be around it more and it'll be closer related to me. I'm used to having cousins. I'm not used to having a niece! Not that I won't get used to her, its just a little strange 'cause she's not visibly around yet. There's a first time for everything tho, so I'm looking forward to her little big headed self &lt;3 (Yes, she does have a big head-I've seen the ultrasound plus my bro is her dad! I'm her auntie, I can say that!)"

"event","&nbsp;Your favorite memory, in great detail<br /><br />Speaking of remembering, you thought I forgot about you, didn't you? Well I did kinda, but not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway. My favorite memory? Maaaaan you asked the WRONG person to choose <em>a favorite</em> memory. I don't like choosing one thing if I don't have to! I'm the kid who suicided (why did we call mixing drinks a suicide? Destined for darkness I was.) her drinks, wore 2 pairs of socks in colors that matched my outfit (in opposite colorways on each foot), and mixed together words on purpose. I can't help but mix stuff (hell, <em>I'M</em> mixed!), and that does not involve choosing one thing. Haven't we gone over this already? No? Maybe? Meh<br />In keeping with that tradition, my favorite memory...well there's a few *grins sheepishly* (maybe I have a problem following rules sometimes? lol). There's a trip to IHOP with somebody, tricking my bro into having a conversation with a bird, a sleepover that had dodgeball/slip n slide/playing in the rain/crazy fashion show, a play fight I had with my bro that involved some Matrix moves, late night to early morn convo followed by walking to a pier to watch the sun rise, anytime I've seen Incubus, various celebrity panels at conventions, various 'conservation camps', water birthday (there's a fave bday post coming so I'll expound upon this one a bit later), various geektastic convos, the time I flipped over and off of my sister...if I went into detail on every single one of those this would be more tl;dr than usual. If you'd like further detail (and have the eyes for it?) on any of them just ask and I'll explain a bit more.<br />In general though, anytime I'm laughing or having fun is pretty much a shoe in for a favorite memory. Also probably anything involving my family, probably because we laugh so much. We've had and still have our ups &amp; downs but throughout all of it we've retained the ability to laugh. Also if it involves rain/water (except if its everywhere and destructivish and not fun), geektastic, concerts/conventions, and/or happenings betwixt the hours of late night and early morn then its probably up there in the favorites. Throw friends in the mix and its even better! Then there are those things that are close to the heart and make my emotochip act...le sigh<div>I guess maybe any positive memory that I can remember is my favorite memory, and I try my best to remember them all =)</div>"

"event","&nbsp;So, yeah. Bro's gf IS preggers! Actually the same day I posted the update we found out for sure lol She's 3-4 months. Everybody's excited! We keep wanting to buy stuff for the baby but we dunno if its a boy or a girl yet. I told them they better not name the baby no cracked out name that will make me punch them in the face lol
History paper...was shit. I had a perfect, beautiful paper planned but for some reason getting it written was like fucking pulling teeth. My professor did allow me to turn it in late and assured me that I wouldn't have to take the class over again. I shot my own A dreams, but at least I'll get a C, which is better than the F I received the first time around...I'LL TAKE IT! unfortunately =( GPAs gonna go up so...*silver lining?* Ending the semester with BBC, woo! lol

Behhh, behh (Italy voice-I've watched too much Hetalia lol)

30 Days to resume soon. Hopefully I'll finish soon as well now that school's out?"

"event","&nbsp;30 days, yeah yeah yeah. I would take two months+ to do a 30 day (wait a minute, did they do some sort of hybrid cover/remix/mashup/remake/esque version of Marilyn Manson's 'Beautiful People' for Burlesque? Trailer was on tv, sorry) post lol I'll finish, in due time.

Anyway, I'm supposed to be writing my history paper, but I kinda don't wanna. I'm gonna and I gotta since I made a deal with my history prof. I don't make promises I can't keep. I have been showing off a bit with my work so I gotta deliver. Its been fun! I've been trying really hard to improve my gpa since life shat upon it toward the end of the first time around in school so I have to pass this class! Others as well but this one's been a personal challenge I've kind of invited because I wanted to prove I was better than I was. This prof is seeing me go from an F student to an A student because I had to prove the F was wrong. Switching gears a bit, also found out I'm almost done with my AA...trying to think how I wanna punctuate that. I am excited 'cause I'll be done with that part and can go on to my BS. I only really want my degree so I can be better prepared for running my own business. I'm not looking to go be a mover &amp; shaker at some company, though with my degree I could? if necessary. I wanna go to school for culinary but I'd have to move to Orlando/Tampa/Ft. Lauderdale. Not that I'd mind moving-I wanna go in Orlando and I could probably rent a room from my friends that live there and possibly offer some house-elf talents, but its a lot easier said than done currently. Just gonna have to make some changes &amp; rearrangements, sketch out some rough/loose plans.
In other news, I might be an aunt? Bro's gf isn't sure if she is or not. She took one test wrong so it was negative/inconclusive (CAN prego tests be 'inconclusive'? lol), took another and I think it was positive. I feel kinda bad 'cause I wasn't all like 'Hooray I'm gonna be an aunt!', but I'm a person that for the most part reacts based on the person. Its hard to gauge if this is what she wants or not. I like to encourage people to do what they wanna do not tell them how I feel about what they're doing. IF this is what she/they want then I'm happy for them and excited about auntdom. IF she is/they are uncertain then I don't wanna be a jackass and potentially make them feel guilty for any conflicting feelings or decisions, 'cause again, its not about what I want. Plus they're still not 100% sure she's preggers! Why fuss when you don't even know for sure yet?! She's supposed to go to the doc at some point soon so we'll see."

"event","&nbsp;Your first kiss, in great detail<br /><br /><br />Hmm, why you wanna know all THAT?! Shoot. I'll tell you, but I can't guarantee I'll talk about it a lot outside of here. Forgive me for taking this moment to be a blushy gushy mess-I'm doing it here so you can't see me lol<br /><br /><br />Actually, prior to my first kiss I wasn't very fond of kissing. I didn't think I'd like it seeing as I pretty much don't like anything do do with bodily fluids. I was a hug person, still very much am. After the kiss though I found that shared with the right person I didn't mind so much and I actually kinda liked it.<br />We were at his house, downstairs on the couch, probably watching Adult Swim 'cause they showed a lot more anime then. (Actually it might've been Samurai Champloo? I don't remember, just that the tv was on. We were kinda nerdy/geeky in our brevity. My cousin thought it was funny &amp; cute that we were all boo'd up on this one little couch we had watching Bones. He was also gonna teach me how to duel w/ Yu-Gi-Oh cards lol Ohhhh yeah, geektastic lovin! But I digress...). I don't remember exactly how we got to kissing. I think he was like 'I'm trying to kiss you' or something like that 'cause I was dorktastic and oblivious. Or he wanted to kiss me but I was sitting in front of him and facing the wrong way so that kinda made it hard to do. Anyway, luckily he was a <em>REALLY</em> great kisser! Like <em>REEEEEAAAAALLLLLYYYYYYY</em> great! Like I said before, I didn't like kissing but he was so good at it that I found it fun and highly enjoyable with him. I've been fascinated by mouths before but never wanting to kiss them, but not fascinated like this. Like seriously I was entranced by the taste of his mouth &amp; breath! I hate the smell/taste of breath with a passion! AND he was a smoker of both legal and illegal things! I hate the smell of cigarette smoke more than I hate the smell of breath so I definitely didn't wanna taste a combo of the two. You'd think that'd be a hell no right off rip but I swear his mouth didn't taste like he smoked. If it would've we probably wouldn't have kissed so much. I don't recall him chewing a lot of gum or eating mints a lot either. His mouth was sweet though!&nbsp;<em>How you smoke but yo mouth taste good?!</em> (he didn't even <em>smell</em> like smoke either! I'm telling you he was the best smelling smoker ever and he didn't even wear cologne! Giiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrllllll don't get me started about how he smelled! That's a convo for another day baby lol) I'm glad we kissed a lot in our short time together! <br />He had been kissin a while though before me so he knew it was my 1st kiss. Probably 'cause I was a little lost so I mostly just let him kiss me and didn't really kiss him back at first. He smiled &amp; chuckled while our lips were still pressed and asked me if it was my first one. I liked the smiley/kissy/talky feeling. I confessed and we laughed, then kissed some more, this time I kissed back! I remember at some point tongues came into play and our teeth even bumped, and I surprisingly liked ALL of it. I cannot stress enough how much I thought I wouldn't like kissing but some of the very things I thought I wouldn't like were my favorite parts. I'm glad we weren't sloppy though 'cause I don't think I could've handled that. That first kiss was almost like being in a dream or something. Like just being in that moment with just us two...I don't even remember other details in full, but the feeling I remember."

"event","**Sorry this took so long? I was part busy and part trying to collect my thoughts. I just kept picking up whever I left off in drafts so hopefully none of the tenses of things fuck you up.**

&nbsp;I was gonna put a certain other very popular song related to dreams as the title but it is reserved particularly close to my heart for personal reasons, and that's a little bit closer than I want to share. The walls are somewhat high and somewhat thick around that thing.

Anyway

Your dreams, in great detail


I guess I'll deal with both? Upon first reading I immediately thought dreams like the ones that go along with hopes and wishes, that hold varying degrees of influence over your life depending on how much you let them. The fantasies and fancies that vibrate to your inner core. The ones that you'd be transcendently elated about if they came true, and if they did they'd maybe even seem somewhat surreal.
Then I thought about those lovely cognitive events that occur when you're sleeping or awake. The ones that try to tell you things, sometimes even like your heart is speaking to you or you head is just trying to make sense of the day. Since I haven't learned to control when and what I dream about I decided that if I had a dream around whenever I got to this 'day' then I guess I'd include it. Otherwise default to the former dreams. Luckily? my brain has been active so I'll share.
Earlier tod...yesterday I dozed off/kinda napped when I got home from school. Got home early 'cause my history professor canceled class for today (Wed 10/13-'cause that's when I started this lol /postfail). I think I missed having class today though 'cause I had a dream about being in class anyway! I dreamed I went to talk to my teacher about my paper that's coming up and telling him about Hetalia. That anime is too great and history class hasn't been the same since watching! also last night I had this weird ass dream that my co Erica came by for something and I told her where it was. She had to go outside for it but she went out the back door and to her old house, but it was from when her grandparents lived there and my house was in my grandma's old apt-which was across the street from Erica's GP's. Anyway she came back at some point. Then I was outside coming up to my house and there were these huge tortoise/ankylosaurus creatures in the front yard and they were bright hot pink, orange, and black. Like erasers come to life! I went up to one and it felt like an eraser, but fuzzy and breathing. I went inside and was like 'WTF?!!?' My sisters were like 'I dunno?'. Then Erica went back through the back door to her GP's and came back and told us they were some sort of chicken type thing. In the back of the house there was like a little fenced in area with little ones and eggs. Does it mean anything? Your guess is as good as mine lol
&nbsp;As far as the life dreams...they're hard to articulate outside of my head and myself. In there I know what they are, but I'm not used to talking about them with people. I dunno. Believe it or not they're kinda traditional? Except mashed up with geektastic and awesome! Husband (y'all know who it is!), kids (preferably boys, if girls I pray they're not typical. Also I CANNOT have dumb kids. That'd kill me even more! They don't have to be fucking Mensa but at least SOME sort of intellectual capacity lol), house with big kitchen &amp; lots of gadgets, travel, family geektastic, happy, comfortable. My not quite yet existant family in my head is freaking awesome yo! Actually those dreams are with or without husband. I'd like one, but not having one wouldn't stop me. I also dream about being a voice actor and/or some sort of cooking type personmajig. I don't think I wanna be like a head chef?, but I wanna be something. Then as far as VA-I've always kinda/used to want to be an actor. I didn't care about being Hollywood famous but kinda being recognised/acknowledged would've been fine. Then I became more self-conscious and a bit more shy somehow. Then I came across anime and cons and voice actors, and it just made perfect sense! I'd get to go to cons, be recognised by fans but still able to do shite 'cause nobody would really know who I was, travel, participate in something I like, could still act and not have to be seen, plus I like accents/words/random noises and I can do voices/accents pretty decent or could probably learn quickly! For so many reasons it just makes sense like I said before!"

Again?! Was somebody out for fashion tips when they made up this 30 day post list?

Anyway, blue was the color of the day! You knew?! How'd you guess?! ;-P Blue is one of the colors that dominates my wardrobe along with red and black so...not a surprise today. Other colors are smatters. Blue t-shirt (was supposed to be for my shirt for an eventual milk pocky cosplay but I wore it sans pocky-dom. Meh, I'll buy another. Plus I have a 2nd non-box idea for pocky cosplay lol), blue jean capris, shinyish ceruleanish blue headband with bow, white sneakers, silver necklace with silver &amp; red heart pendant. Was gonna wear my blue &amp; gray striped socks for some color but didn't have time to find them this morning. Yes, I add gray for color lol"

Well its Monday so not very much. Watch I manage to word up the past two days though! lol
Yesterday-went grocery shopping, washed my hair while listening to APC Mer de Noms, washed some clothes, cleaned my apartment-I was becoming stressed out that stuff just accumulated over 2-3 weeks and nobody did anything. You could really tell that college students lived here. Not in a slob/I don't care type way but because we're all so busy with school/work and tired. I think its the junkiest our house has been in the 6 months we've been here =S Slightly more sane now its clean =D, watched some Hetalia-best anime interpretation of world history ever!, definitely makes it interesting lol, Boardwalk Empire, Bored to Death, East Bound and Down, and a movie I think that I can't remember what (I just remember it went into BWE so I caught the 2nd half the 1st time around)-wait-it was Generator Rex and Sym-Bionic Titan, oh and math homework, and downloaded some j-/darkwave/neoclassical/gothic/visual kei music from a lolita site
Today-school: microcomputer class at 8am-did some excel shite, library internetery to waste time, college algebra at 12pm-review for test and someone got the teacher to approve a two-sided 3x5 index card cheat sheet instead of a one-sided like she originally planned, world history at 1pm-went over Russian revolutions &amp; communism, someone in that class asked half jokingly about canceling class Wednesday since her other 2 classes were canceled and my professor considered it heavily! I was one of 2 people that didn't want class 'canceled' 'cause I'm such a nerd lol Prof agreed that if everyone showed up today (so we'd all know and he wouldn't have to email everybody. He did anyway 'cause that's just how he is) then he'd give us the day off since our class is ahead of his other classes. We all settled on it being a 'research day' to justify it further., money in the bank, home, randomositous televisionry-Women of Ninja Warrior!, Opposite of Sex, a smidge of Doctor Who, show about the Koran on Nat Geo, show about WWI and now one about WWII on Discovery Military, randomositous internetery, then 30 days updates


Told you I'd manage to word it up! Maybe its a good thing today's only Monday and I did this. Here's to the rest of the week!

"event","&nbsp;*Let's see, where was I? Started this the other day but was suffering from dumbdumbdumb or something-posted it on accident with nothing but a title! Then my battery abruptly died while I was writing and it didn't save so I was just like 'Fuck it'. Now, unfuck it, let's try this again*<br /><br /><br />Day 11-Your siblings, in great detail<br /><br /><br /><u>Mom Sibs</u>:<br />Brittany*<br />Bridgit*<br />Francisco/Jr<br /><br />*twins<br /><br /><br /><u>Sibs via that man</u>:<br />Older sister, diff mom-Tasha*<br />Younger bro, diff mom-Aaron Jr.*<br />Step-sisters...I think one's named Tiffany? (dunno them, bro's sisters, not mine)<br /><br />*Direct paternal linkage w/each other and Me &amp; twins<br /><br /><br />Mom sibs are the ones I consider my siblings. I grew up with them. The others I don't really know so they're kinda irrelevant. Not to be mean, just honest &amp; realistic. If I ever know them more in a good way then maybe they'll become relevant. I kinda took my other lil bro under my wing of sorts but he was annoying and something told me not to get too close to him. (I'm very picky about who I get close to and how close I get. Its a mix of respecting them as the person they are and the vibe I get from them.)<br />Mom sibs I love! They're each awesome in their own way. I like that I've had some influence on them all in varying degrees. Makes my big sister ego happy lol For the most part we get along. Some of them have some things that annoy me or that I might care less for, and I'm pretty sure vice versa, but its not enough to be all super sib brawl over. We accept each other for who we are. Even the times that we haven't gotten along haven't lasted too long. We could seriously have a spat, maybe beat each other up somehow, then minutes to days later (depending on the scuff) its almost like it never happened. We beat each other up more out of playfulness rather than anger! Again, not that we fight terribly physically, but we hit each other and junk-to annoy and/or be random lol.<br /> We've had a few epic 'fights' throughout the years! One time I had to bust crazy ninja/matrix moves or risk busting my face getting past my bro in a 'video game' fight! There have been several penny throwing battles and a few me vs the twins fights (which I usually won lol). Haha, actually the other day I wrestled Brittany to the ground in Publix! It was so fast she didn't know what to do. My mom's presence was my saving grace to not getting cursed out by Brittany lol (cursing at each other is kinda normal for us too, again not out of mean-spiritedness, just because its funny) We fight, but we fight for fun or entertainment value, never out of anger or malice with intentions to hurt. I usually end up breaking stuff on accident or causing someone to break it though lol Well so far my bro's room door and Britt's picture frame, but still. I'm kinda strong with a lot of force, and sometimes it takes a lot of force to take me out ;-)<br />My sisters and brother and I like to have fun with each other and laugh. Me or my brother are usually the ones bringin the funny with crazy antics (actually my mom always brings up how funny it is how much alike my bro and I are even though we're oldest/youngest, girl/boy, diff dads-which is true! Its like we all had each other, but the twins had each other a bit more with that twinly thing, so me and my brother have always kinda had each other. I'm like an all in one big sis/big bro to him lol). We're worse/crazier when combined! (Then again my crazy mixes easily with others', dunno who's crazy amps the other more!) The best is when we're all involved doing or saying something stupid and all cracking up laughing until muscles that shouldn't hurt from just laughing do. Also when we get my mom in on it. Hell, even when the situation's not the greatest, even though sometimes it might take longer than others depending on what's happening, we still find a way to laugh. Shoot, not gonna lie, getting behind in bills and having your lights shut off really sucks. Despite that those have been some of the most fun times I've had with my family. We refer particularly to the power less times as 'Conservation Camp' &nbsp;and crack jokes and shit about what we're doing, not doing, or pretending we're alt doing lol Are we environmental or what?! Haha!"

"event","&nbsp;Your beliefs, in great detail


Hmm. Some of this stuff is stuff that I've given thought to personally, but haven't/never really discussed with others at length. I'm fine with my beliefs and updating them as I see fit. As am I fine with others doing the same. I may not always agree with another, but that is their decision, not mine. I guess maybe I don't share my beliefs so much with others due misunderstanding and not getting the same respect/opportunity I have afforded others. I'm kinda used to not being understood, but I don't wanna always have to defend myself against someone who doesn't or refuses to understand.
I guess if I had to give some sort of range of familiarity to my beliefs it'd be somewhere around agnosticism? I was raised as a baptist christian? I don't think my mom was as religious as she thought or wanted to be. Not that she's not religious, but it always felt like she was mostly because its how she grew up. Maybe that's just her experience with it? My sisters and I joined church when I was 10, and even then I didn't join because I truly wanted to. I think I've probably always asked 'Why?' for the most part from the day I was born, and even at my young age I had a bit of a problem with being told to believe something 'cause I was supposed to. It was confusing being told that my pastor's interpretation of the bible was right when it was exactly that-an interpretation. If his was right then why did other people interpret different things? Did that make his wrong? Did it make me wrong if I didn't agree? Plus I'd always been a fan of science, and not to say that it was always 100% right, but at least I could see it. From it all I took that there was a higher power, I just wasn't sure exactly what or who it was.
 I never really felt affected by religion (well except that one time with the song. OT-I remember I felt that way once when I observed lightning in the night sky while I was in the shower also. This puts me at 3 non-religious religious experiences in 25 years. Well 2 if you count the song one as religious. It was a religious song, in church. But still...) until I encountered eastern religions. I've contemplated Buddhism plenty of times as its probably closest to aligning with my beliefs. No want, no suffering. Or maybe I'm a masochist robot lol Looked at being pagan/wiccan too for a few seconds. I guess I'd find it hard to adhere to just one if I didn't believe/accept all of it, regardless of religion. Plus I like truth. Then again people are picking and choosing various aspects of religions that resonate with them a lot more frequently since the turn of the century. Maybe I'll reconcile myself with a religion or religions someday?
Until then I'll keep believing in peace, love, understanding, freedom, equality, the individual, reality, transcendence, music, and possibility ;-)"

"event","&nbsp;A moment, in great detail<br /><br /><br />I've written about this particular moment before but its been awhile so I'll indulge you again. July 2004 (or was it June? Or October? I'm getting old yo) I went to my first Incubus concert. I was super excited 'cause I love Incubus ridiculously and I was probably a bit more fervent then (that feels weird to say considering I still love them ridiculously lol). I believe they were touring for A Crow Left of the Murder. Things were going well all day-got to Tampa super early, jammed out in the car with my cuzo and my aunt was cool about it-System of a Down and some headbangin teens at 4am in the morning, she was a trooper!, got to the venue early, met some cool people, had floor seats, someone gave my aunt a ticket so she even went. We got in line early before doors opened then our accumulated group and everyone else made a break for it once the doors opened. We got a <em>REALLY</em> good spot too-right at the rail in front of the stage! Started out more centerish but found my way closer to the speakers on the right of us, but I maintained my front spot dammit! Wilena got caught in the crowd but didn't get moved too far away. There was a guy we met who was a really huge fan and he was telling us about everybody's stage behavior ( Brandon starts off with water then makes his way to wine) and how other shows had gone (drum off between Jose &amp; Brandon on bongos!). I found it intriguing and fascinating, Wilena found him annoying lol<br />Anyway, all the music was so good! I got lost in it. It was a very transcendental experience. Best part-other than when Brandon came over to my side of the stage and was singing (I think we even made eye contact for a quickly fleeting moment. It was enough though!)-was when they played 'The Warmth' I believe. (I might actually have to go back and check my entry about the show to make sure I got stuff right with my memory yo. OLD I tell you!) That was already one of my favorite songs but I think the performance solidified it and made it even more a favorite. They did the super bass overdrive one. I was in front of the speakers and we were all jam packed in so it was hot. At one moment though during the song the bass is going and Brandon's singing the oh oh oh oh &nbsp;part just before the song ends, and vibrations were so strong that I could literally feel the waves vibrating through my body to my inner core and it created some air on my legs. Coupled with already being lost in the music that was the best moment ever, and I have not experienced anything like it since. This description doesn't even do nearly enough justice to the feeling. It was like some cosmic octave/music of the spheres type shit yo! I might have mixed up the song or the part of the song now that time has passed, but the feeling is just as if it happened yesterday and I will never forget that.<br /><br />Now I need to go find/reread my journal from then. Might link back to it or make an addendum to note where my memory failed/tailored the experience lol<br /><br /><br /><strong><u><em>*Update*</em></u></strong> <br />Song was probably super bass overdrive 'Drive' but I wasn't even certain back then either-could've been 'Stellar' or 'Pantomime'; I have felt like that only one other time before that which was surprisingly in church-but it was during a song we sang in the choir that day, not the pastor preaching. Still music so...; Drum off included Ben too-he was on a smaller set of drums and Brandon was on bongos and of course Jose on his drums. This led into Jose's awesome drum solo where he created so much wind his hair was blowing everywhere which amused me lol; AND I wrote about this <em>exactly</em> 6 years and 1 day from the date of the show! It was September 30, 2004. How great is that?! Synchronicity at its finest folks ;-)<br /> <em>In case</em> you're interested (and not tired of reading?) here's the OP:&nbsp;<a href=""http://squiggly-chi.livejournal.com/13386.html"">squiggly-chi.livejournal.com/13386.html</a>"

"event","&nbsp;Your best friend, in great detail<br /><br /><br />Well, I don't have *a* best friend in particular. Though very endearing, that term was a bit touchy for me in the past. I guess maybe it still is? When I was young especially I made friends with the quickness and I was a friend that a lot of people wanted to be around. It got to the point that a couple of my friends fought (not physically thank goodness) over who's best friend I was and who was my best friend. I liked all my friends back then (and still do!) so it was hard to choose only one best friend and it felt unfair to also. I decided that I wouldn't choose one 'best' friend in particular. I get along with a lot of people, sometimes differently than each other, so it wasn't right to me to say that one or some friends were better just because I got on differently with them you, know? Plus I always felt/feel bad when people refer to me as their best friend when I can't/won't do it in return. I do make an exception for my Cindy though-she's been around and a part of my family and I the same that I just don't even think about it. I've referred to her before as my best friend.<br />Even though I don't really designate best friends I won't deny that there are some that I'm closer to than others so they might be a little more special to me. I think as an aquarian being all about friends and just about everybody being your friend (hell, some of my sisters' &amp; brother's friends are my friends too) I had to do some sort of prioritization so 'friend' would actually mean something lol (my people take that friend shit real serious!). Shout out to my neo-Marauders Jessi/Moony and Olivia/Padfoot! They know some shit bout some shit yo. I don't see them all the time-Padfoot even less, Moony &amp; I get to hang out at times-but convos pick up like there was never any time in between. That is one recurring thing in my friendships, the running conversation/communication. It might not be everyday or on a regular basis, but its never awkward or wtf-y, just random! Shout out to Jamie &amp; Ajane-again, just like my Cindy they're just like family. I'm one of Aja's daughter's godmothers! ^_^ Fack, I'm just gonna start naming 'cause everybody's along the spectrum of close, knows or is like family, running random convos, I'll do stuff for them that usually goes against my personal space restrictions or somewhat OCDness with people in gen, and maybe even knows some shit 'bout some shit-Natasha, Rojana, Chad, Meghan, Latoya, Candy. There's probably more lol (I <em>hate</em> choosing friends! I love <em>ALL</em> of you!)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

Well, I wish I had epic adventures for you but, I don't. My day was quite boring. I don't go outside/into the sunlight unless I have to 'cause its so fucking hot! Seriously, I'm black pale yo. Then again I'm really hard to get out of the house in general. Fall is here though so maybe that'll change? Maybe 'cause its 'darker' then during the day, and cooler.
Anyway, woke up to...a uterine massacre (like a boss), took a shower (like a boss), did computer junk (like a boss), contemplated watching either more Hetalia (wanna finish or watch as much as possible before we get to WWI in my history class 'cause I'm a dork like that), Monster, Wolf's Rain, or live action Nana-didn't watch any (like a boss), spoke with my sisters &amp; mom before they went to work &amp; shopping (like a boss), ate some cereal (like a boss), turned down shopping (like a boss), got back in bed (like a boss), fell back asleep (like a boss), woke up (like a boss) (today was kind of a snorlax day for me-sleep, eat, repeat. I felt a bit like carp thanks to super girly funtime show so I didn't wanna do much of anything.), contemplated researching &amp; writing my paper for microecon (like a boss), decided I really didn't like that class and really didn't wanna put the effort into writing a crappy paper or turning one in late for a class I don't like then looked up procedures to withdraw from a class (like a boss), made a sandwich for dinner (like a boss), watched Chopped Champions/Iron Chef America/FMA Brotherhood (like a boss), put a relaxer in my sister's hair (like a boss), Frankie said relax to my hair too (like a boss), now doing this, listening to a Mars Volta/Our Lady Peace/Tool/A Perfect Circle mix, gonna blow dry my hair, revise the grocery list, then try to hit it to bed so I can do junk tomorrow and stuff (all that like a boss!)

Really? Something this mundane? In great detail? Well depending on how much you love food I guess it could be more exciting. But still.

Technically I haven't eaten today. So I'm done. Holla folks!

I actually wasn't certain how this one was gonna go. I have fucked up eating habits. Sometimes I don't eat because I wasn't really thinking about it until I realised I was hungry (does that make sense? To me it does). Sometimes I ravage the fridge &amp; raid the cabinets pirate style. Plus I can't eat normal. I always try to find a way to make it extra somehow. &nbsp;When I cook for others I try to make it make sense. When its just for me, well it can teeter along the lines of but not quite reach crazy pregnant lady lol

Anyhow! Today I ate:

*A bowl of half &amp; half Golden Grahams and Cinnamon Toast Crunch (my cereal jams with GG being my new fave!)
*A blueberry bagel/cream cheese/turkey sandwich with mixed sour cream &amp; onion/cheddar &amp; sour cream chips
*2 random slices of turkey
*Oven baked pork chops-breaded &amp; seasoned with garlic powder, hot sauce, paprika, black pepper, and green bell pepper, with rice pilaf and broccoli (it was my turn to cook and I didn't wanna make boring pork chops lol)

"event","&nbsp;Your parents, in great detail


My parents. Hmm, my parents. Well, I have a mom and a 'sperm donor'. Dads are there for their kids, mine wasn't. Much to my delight or dismay I've done some stuff that's very tell-tale that I am my parents' child.
I grew up and have spent my whole life around my mom so she's my favorite parent, but not necessarily by default. She's nice and always thinking about others more so than herself-a blessing and a curse. She is also fiercely defensive and protective of her family. She'd defend us now in a heartbeat for any perceived threat, and my siblings and I are all grown. Her defensiveness is another blessing and a curse. We're so different in communication that we got into physical fights at least once a year from the time I was 13 til I was 18. I would say some slick shit and be fly out the mouth, or she would just not understand what I was meaning and take stuff the wrong way. By this time she was already mad and I didn't make it any better by being a smart ass. She'd start, I'd try to defend myself, it was mistaken for attacking back, thus making the situation worse. Definitely a rough patch. Despite the roughness of that time I learned stuff about myself and her. Ever the student and optimist am I. I never really cared for conflict nor fighting with my mom and they served to reiterate each other. We're not best friends but we do get along quite well. She still does stuff that annoys me but who's mom doesn't? I love my mama dearly though.
 &nbsp;She's everybody's favorite sister and aunt. Hell, I dunno how many people throughout the years and even still wish that my mom was their mom. Not that she's perfect or be shittin on all the other mamas out there, but she is very nurturing. Everything that those people weren't getting from their own mom they found in my mom. Sometimes I didn't wanna share, but my mom taught me that sharing was loving, and that's still very ingrained in me to this day. If I have it you can pretty much get it. Part mom, part big family, part southern hospitality.
Then there's that man. Despite conscious efforts to acknowledge him with the father/dad epithet, I don't hate him. I actually don't really know him. I've heard he was goofy, awesome, and quite literally a little crazy (found out some years back he was diagnosed with manic-depression, dunno how bad it is though)-all of which I was able to 'inherit'. I don't really know the dude though. Its always a little weird when my cuzo shares fond memories of him. I don't know how to feel, whether to be indifferent but happy for her or a bit of admiration &amp; relation to him.
My mom &amp; him divorced when I was 4. He tried to deny paternity of my sisters. The last time I saw him was when I was 10. No, wait, last I saw him was an other side of my family 4th of July gathering last year. (We were 'lured' with a guarantee that he wasn't gonna be there. Then he showed up, stood three feet away from us at our table and didn't speak. His bros &amp; sis that know us spent the rest of his time bitchin him out about it.) He gave us used toys for Christmas one year. He never wanted to take the three of us together, always only me. He and his wife would laugh at my mom while she was working when they went there. He would see us out in public and would pass by like we didn't exist. My family had to force us upon him so he'd speak. 'We say more by saying nothing at all'. My aunt (his sis) asked my mom not to speak badly of him to us or turn us against him. She didn't, but not because she was asked. I made my decision very early on. Instead of being all whiny and wondering why I just decided to reciprocate and not to care. Plus like I said, I don't know him anyway.
He's shown signs of wanting to...reconcile? Get to know us? Once when we stayed with my aunt (his sis) he came over and asked if he could see us. She told us she wasn't gonna make us, it was our choice. My sisters went to the door at least. Not me. He's recently told my cuzo that I'm close to that he would do stuff for us, which was very unexpected. He even acknowledged the fact that he had nothing to do with the way my sisters &amp; I turned out when he was given a compliment by my sisters' co-workers. I dunno. I think he's getting old and realizing some shit. Maybe attempting to be sentimental but he doesn't know how. He thinks we don't like him, but he's never asked. I heard he &amp; his wife were on the shits &amp; maybe getting a divorce. She was a driving force behind him not having anything to do with us. Maybe he's slowly escaping her control and feels bad. I dunno. We'll see what happens and cross that bridge when we get there. I just don't know how easy or hard its gonna be."

"event","&nbsp;Ohhhhh my gosh. Day 2 you are already making me ready to bail out on this joint. Just like I do my emotions 'cause they make me feel weird. Maybe if I type fast I can get through this? Still there's the thinking! -.-&nbsp;<br /><br />Bah! Ok, onward from dawdling.<br /><br />Your first love, in great detail<br /><br />*le sigh* My first love &lt;3 Anyone who knows me very closely most likely already knows, whether they know that they do or not. Forgive me if my inner 13 year old lashes out from time to time. Hopefully she doesn't make me make this tl;dr lol<br /> <br />Anyway, as with pretty much any aquarian child, my first love is a friend. (who as usual will remain nameless, I'm totally a dork and private about that. Also it keeps me...<em>under</em>whelmed? I get nervous just thinking about it. A good nervous, but physically, good &amp; bad nervous feel the same =S) I met him in 6th grade when we started going to the same school together. We were both in the gifted program, and I specifically remember meeting him in science class (I'm going to revel geektastically in this fact. Even <em>MORE</em> so should anything ever happen! Oh the things that make me happy). I don't remember exactly how, I just remember being at the same table and laughing. I don't even remember when exactly we became friends, we just did. Science, laughter, friendship-looking back he had me from the very beginning!<br />We went to school together from the beginning of middle school through the end of high school. I used to find out his schedule or the better part of it every year and I'd go ways to my classes that just so happened to either the same as his or maybe where he was getting out of class. He also used to chase me and try to whack me on the ass with his lunch box which was nicknamed 'The Booty Bag'! lol There were some epic chase scenes that confused the hell out of people &amp;/or administrators sometimes! I used to do stupid, little shit just to be around him (probably as did <em>EVERY OTHER GIRL</em> that liked him! I dunno how many times I had friends who simultaneously had crushes with me on this dude.). I'd rush to my class, go to his class in the remaining time we had to get to class, then I had to hit it back to my own class so I wouldn't be late. I had a bracelet that I made him put on for me even after I figured a way to put it on myself. And the hugs! Oh the hugs! &lt;3<br />My fangirl beginnings (when I get excited about something I try to learn as much as possible about it, even silly stuff, regardless, even to this day) also lead me to find out some other similarities we had-both oldest child, gifted, knack for british accents (we used to talk to each other with them, still do sometimes lol), love for words/language/linguistics, same height/arm span &amp; ratio (I was in middle school, shut up! We'll ignore the fact that I had a list too.), striking similarities in our birth charts (all but 4 signs are the same out of 10-12. I've an interest in astrology but I'm not super 'Astrology guide me!'. <em>THAT</em> though I couldn't ignore. I mean, I'm just sayin. But again we're ignoring this fact too lol), et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We even liked the same Shel Silverstein poem and memorized &amp; recited it together/to each other! (<em>DAAAAMN</em>, I remember that?! I was such a dork!) Not in a 'Me oui, ohh darleeng!' way, more like a contest/excited OMG! way, but still. Throughout the years the synchronicities continued. Even to this day, just like our friendship. I like to think we're like binary stars, caught up in each others' gravitational pull Greatest achievements though-I got him into Dave Matthews Band and Harry Potter &lt;3&lt;3 (wish I could claim getting him into anime but whoever did I appreciate it nonetheless lol)<br />He knew I liked him. He's found out at least 3 different times, 2 of those I was either forced to out myself or I did it willingly. The willingly one went interestingly. I got shy when he wanted to talk and I never called him about it. We've never even actually talked about it. I've tried to find the words to have the conversation, but they get lost in the feeling and nothing does it justice. He knows, but he doesn't <em>know</em>. It is a conversation I do intend to have someday, regardless. Even though we never official talked about it, I think he still knows. He always said he didn't wanna ruin our friendship. For me personally, if we tried and things didn't work out, it would take a lot more than a break up and/or a broken heart to lose me as a friend. Ah, complications!<br /><br />*looks at preview* Well that wasn't as long as I thought it was. I think that's good? I'm apologising to your eyes anyway, just in case.<br />"

Ummm, I'm really bad at talking about myself. Unless its a random flash of cockiness, but that's usually specific. I like to laugh and have my version of fun, which is pretty much anything I consider fun to do. I love to learn about anything and everything. Its probably a main drive of mine. A relic of my days as a gifted kid if you will. I'm surprisingly shy and nervous. Surprising to anybody who knows me closely or met me before about 2003 that is. I may not talk a lot at first, but once we get to know each other or you see me around family then I become more comfortable and who knows what you'll see! I've personal quirks that I'm comfortable with for the most part. I love music though I'm sad to admit that I lost some of the fervor I had back in the day. I don't listen as much or the same way I used to. Then again a lot of things are like that. But that's besides the point. I'm nerdy/geeky. Hello, learning is probably my favorite pastime! I generally don't like crowds but I make the exception for concerts and conventions. I always wanna runaway at cons lol 
Generally I'm nice and get along with everybody. If you don't give me a reason not to like you then I won't. Usually once I become your friend I'm hard to shake off, even if we don't talk or see each other a lot. I will usually support you and encourage you to do things you wanna do-good and sometimes even bad depending on the spirit ;-) &nbsp;If we ever become not friends or I'm mad at you then maybe you should re-evaluate some things. I put up with a lot of shit. I mean A LOOOOT of shit. People don't always realise this. You'll know when I'm done dealing with it. I like corny jokes and staying up late. I also like to cook.

I dunno. I guess I'm done. I do better at answering questions. Most anybody reading this already knows me anyway so. If you read this and you don't know me then ask me a question I guess"

Talking on the phone is tiring to me, especially for extended periods. I do have friends who have different communication methods than I, so if I get a call from them I usually try to answer or give them a call back...at some point, to be respectful of their preferred communication style and not be a crappy friend. I could text just about all day though! I've had text convos that have gone on for days because its easier to reference back to what you were talking about than it is in a phone call. My conversations don't always take on a logical progression either. Then there's work, school, driving, sleeping, etc that can interrupt convos. Since texting doesn't have as much a sense of immediacy for a response (despite being instant) its easier to talk when you're available instead of missed phone calls, phone tag, and calling back. Also, I get cut off in conversation (a lot?) and out of some strange courtesy I have a hard time bringing the conversation back to whatever I was talking about-especially if its gone in a different direction. Not a problem in texts-no cut off!<br />&nbsp;Behavior can be different depending on method. Usually if I'm sending an e-mail its for work so I'm gonna be more professional. I also tend to be more formal in writing than verbally. In general I'm better 'on paper' than in convo 'cause it give me more time to think rather than be awkward! There's also a bit of anonymity granted in text/e-mail, especially depending who you're talking to, which makes it easier to be bolder, &nbsp;flirtier, nicer, meaner, different than you would be face to face. I've responded to people I didn't know very differently-either a bit meaner or a bit more outgoing depending on the encounter-in an errant IM or text message than I would possibly have in a face to face encounter. If I know you then in general I'm pretty much the same face to face or not.<br />"

"event","<br /><p>So I just finished watching the full series of Fullmetal Alchemist-just in time too 'cause the new series is coming out <i>and</i> I found out that Funimation's gonna air it on their site 2 days after the Japanese airing (&lt;-thanks sanjo_chan for that info!) XD I seem to keep doing that timing thing-same with Death Note...of sorts. But I digress! I'm borrowing Conqueror of Shamballa from my cuzo 'cause I'm too impatient to wait until I buy it to see it. Gah, such a fiend!<br />So 2, I was showing my sisters some vids of Vic &amp; Caitlin from MegaCon last year (so sad I missed it this year) and I showed them the one of them saying it then Vic explains. Then I got to thinking-Mustang is one of my favorite characters from that show, I <i>am</i> going to Anime Festival Orlando this year and I haven't figured out exactly what I wanna cosplay as (I swear I need somewhere I can put a cosplay list for myself online so I don't have to worry about finding my notebook everytime I wanna add something. Yar.). In my head I've played around with Rose from FMA, Winry in her black skirt &amp; jacket, Merle from Escaflowne, and Cooking Mama-'cause I fucking love that game to ridiculousness!! (so great seeing her added to Super Smash Bros. 3000 Murder Mystery-Toad died, they threw him in the dumpster, then she comes in with some food that had mushroom in it! I wish I could've gone to Anime Supercon 'cause I think that's where they performed it. Youtube it yo. All 7 parts!) Seeing as I don't sew but am dying to learn, these all seemed to range from easy to fairly easy <i>if</i> I actually had to do some sewing for any reason whatsoever. But now my mind has released itself upon me and this Colonel Mustang mini skirt edition is running obssessively and rampantly in reality!! (though not that I mind ;-P) I've convinced myself that I have to do this cosplay because its just too awesomely fun to pass up and I do have an opportunity to wear it, <i>SOON</i>, and I hate wasted ideas that are so great but have no room or chance for fruition. <i>Carpe Cosplay! Carpe Convention!</i> lol<br />So 3, now I'm trying to figure everything out for it. I'm torn and put in a position where I have to choose the lesser or two or three evils (that's how many I've come up with so far and they have inadvertantly spawned subsets of evils. How terribly <i>evil</i> of the lot!). Biggest and easiest way out would be to buy the Riza costume from mooncostumes. However I have problems with this. First, I hate the color. The shade of blue is too too light in my opinion and it just looks craptastic and it makes me sad. I'm a perfectionist of sorts and I like to get as true as possible to the look. I am/can also be terribly stubborn and anything less won't suffice-even if I do give in. This leaves me with the 2 other evils-get it commissioned, or make it myself. As I mentioned before I don't sew and this jacket seems intimidating for a noob! I do have a habit of jumping noobtastically head first into things that are beyond me, but not to the point where I disregard the basics. I might just run through 'em and revisit or try to figure them as I go! lol I'd like to make it myself though 'cause it'd be fun and I like creating and making stuff and it'd be rewarding to know that I actually did it. I almost wanna comish it though 'cause I don't wanna fuck it up. Those can be expensive and I'd kinda rather find someone who's closer to me instead of sending them a list of measurements and letting them have at it-maybe unless they're really good. Which leads me back to getting the mooncostumes one. I think maybe the best thing about that one is that I could always just pin the skirt to the shortness I want it for the mini skirt and then let it back down to do Sciezka.<br />Now, let's revisit the idea of it being made. I'm trying to figure whether I wanna keep the general pencil skirty look just shorter or to make a wrap skirt or maybe a pleated skirt. I do love pleated skirts! But still. Decisions decisions.<br />Then there's the hair. Do I wanna stick with Mustang's regular hair or make a girl version of sorts and get a medium/long wig for it? It'd be kinda cool to have like a bob-ish type something 'cause its Mustangy in my opinion. But I still wanna maintain the character. But do I wanna look like a man in a mini skirt?! (think of it as if you were seeing a visual of Ed's-I imagine it would be overly exaggerated and antagonizingly emasculating so that it'd annoy Mustang more. Maybe I just think too much, but still!) Prolly not lol! I was thinking I could time a perm right for the convention and just wrap my hair-its not long but its not short but its not medium either if that makes sense?! It just...<i>is</i>. I don't think about it much. I do have naturally dark brown to where it looks black hair but I like dying it red and I just did about a month or 2 ago and I'm letting the color grow out (*le gasp* oh noz! Except not, I don't care about it matching and convincing people that its natural. I just like red hair xD). I think a good amount of it will be grown out by July/August, and I don't go out in the sun a lot for the sun to turn it so that may be a cheaper option than a wig. I'll just dye it blackest black-which I sadly still have problems with 'cause all black dyes are not created equal! How horrible would it be to have purplish or greenish black hair?! Maybe I'll practice with it now?! I'd definitely have to time a perm right though 'cause thanks to my mama's mixed heritage I got some thick ass hair that's more black than puerto rican so as it grows it tends to thicken and swell of sorts. If I tried to just wrap it then it'd look like a sad memory of a wrap!<br />Hmmmm. Anyway, those are the biggest things bothering me right now. Its okay though, I like the challenge! I'll sift through patterns and modifications and color swatches of the right color and gloves and boots and et ceteras! This has to be as kick ass as possible! Maybe I'll enter the cosplay contest?-if I end up making it myself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*x-posted! to other places I haunt*</p>"

"event","<br /><p class=""blogSubject"">So I plan on in the near future-like in 2010 near future-going to Japan for my birthday. Tonight (or this&nbsp;morning, wha'ev) I happened to remember to check out an official travel Japan site and snoop around. They're having some sort of event for the winter and it runs through the end of February. I checked it out and there were pictures of houses covered in snow and stuff. That's when it hit me-I'd be in Japan during the winter because of my birthday falling in February. I realized I'd be in <em>snow</em> for my <em>birthday. SNOW!!!! FOR MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! <img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/awake.gif"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/naughty.gif"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/giddy.gif"" />&nbsp;</em>I'm so fucking excited!!! I'm still jumping up and down on the inside, mostly 'cause if I did it on the outside too I might wake someone! I'm so accustomed to my Florida weather during the winter (Oh! I remember one time I had an unplanned&nbsp;'water themed' birthday and I went to the beach-fuck yeah! I likes the waters a lot!&nbsp;But I digress...)&nbsp;that I slightly somewhat forgot that its snows in places during the winter lol And I felt kinda dumb-like other places are always hot. When I went to Denver last year I was so excited to see and be in/around snow. The coldness from it to your nose made it seem like you were always breathing in clean even if there was dirty, slushy snow. Well to me anyway. I'm pretty sure that if I had more time I probably would've gone all super obviously touristy and been all like 'Snow, its so different the sun! We don't have snow where I'm from. Can I take it with me?!?!' So now I'm even more super mega excited!!!!<br />I'm trying to decide whether I wanna go for a whole week or not. I probably will, but still. The only sucky part is that my b-day's in the early part of the week I'd go. Unless I did some funky midweek thing. Knowing me and my OCD self I'll probably make it where my birthday is the middlest day of my trip. Thanks to my somewhat recent bite from the travel bug I'm trying to decide whether to expand beyond Japan or not. I'd love to go to India! Then I thought 'Well I might as well go to England 'cause there's Indian/Asian <em>AND</em> British people there too!!!! Two birds with one stone, how baller is that?! Oh and Jamaican people too-which I don't really care about but just to hear other nationalities' accents with a British tint is enough of a reason to care lol! Then I just jumped off on a tangent of places I wanna go: the aforementioned, Ireland, I think Spain and Italy are still on my list-I was obsessed with them back in the day! I even made yarn bracelets in the colors of their flags and wore them ragged or at least until I lost them 'cause I took 'em off and forgot about them., I was also obsessed with Maryland back in the day 'cause my friend told me about watchin chipmunks from the window. Now I'm obsessed 'cause that's where Michael Phelps is from! Two obsessions join as one lol!, and as of recent California,&nbsp;New York, New Orleans, and surprisingly to me maybe even Paris. I admit France never really caught my fancy much, but it is the home of Daft Punk and I was watching a competition on Food Network-I think it was dessert/sweetish something or other. I know they had to make cake, petite cakes, chocolate, and a sugar show piece. America was the reigning champ 2 years in a row but Japan and France were their biggest competition out of every other country that was participating. The theme was yin and yang, and while others expressed it more literally, France's sugar piece was more contrasts and they did like a 'glass' structure/building with flowers and such on it to show the contrast between agrarian and industrial society. It was beautifully executed and that was the best/clearest sugar pulled glass I've ever seen, and from what I hear that is not an easy feat. Plus-they don't fuck around when it comes to tempering chocolate! I think they won even though I wanted Japan to win, but they deserved it. Oh, and if I remember correctly the architecture duo that designed the Bird's Nest for the 2008 Olympics is french as well. Okay, so I'm seeing some reasons why France is somewhat appealing to me-mostly architecture/design/decor/et cetera, but still. Actually New Orleans and Paris go hand in hand for me as far as why I wanna go. I've to blame a recent interest in Lolita fashion which lead to just about anything Victorian/gothic (well the gothic interest already existed, but still), plus a read of <em>Interview With The Vampire</em> which reinforced the Victorian/Gothic interest and added the layer of existant&nbsp;vampire interest, then the viewing of that movie which further reiterated and reinforced all of the above. (OMG-Brad Pitt was <em>SOOOOOOO </em>prettily hot beyond understanding in that movie!-and I despised Louis' constant whining in the book at first but he did become my favorite character-and it didn't hurt that Brad Pitt was cast to play him yo!) Plus to add to all that there's a Disney movie coming out next year that's set in Nola and its just a lovely backdrop that's rife with&nbsp;possibility for this&nbsp;story! It'd be fantastically great if they got Harry Connick Jr. to do something for the soundtrack since he's from there!!!! *sigh* I wish I could've gone pre-Katrina but I'm pretty sure its still a lovely, lively, wonderful place. As long as I can still go on the Vampire tour whenever I go then I'm straight!!<br />I did talk about going to New York next year for my birthday to see Equus 'cause its last run is <em>ON</em> my birthday!! I'll admit I'd have mostly gone 'cause it was Dan Radcliffe and not 'cause it was naked Dan Radcliffe. I don't really care for naked so that wasn't exactly a plus. Then I saw a picture of him without a shirt and he is scarily not attractive! I don't mind skinny dudes, I don't mind pasty whiteness (I've my own pasty, blinding yellow version of that goin on! Maybe I should get some sun? Invest in some shorts? Go outside? Nah, it's take away from my 'vampirism' lol), but he was just...scary. I forgot about going for the play though and have progressed in plans with my sisters and cuzo to go to Key West for me and cuzo's b-days since they're within days of each other so now I'm doin that. When I remembered my New York intentions I was like 'Oh! Yeah. Oh well.&quot;. But at least for Key West we're going on her birthday...and coming back on mine!!! How cheesily fantastic is that?!?! The cheese factor in that single aspect alone makes up for the once in a lifetime-ish event of possibly seeing/meeting? Dan on my birthday! Plus I might get a tat for meself for me day o' birth. I'll prolly get it once we come back in town. It'll still be my birthday so I'm good.<br />Now I wanna go to NY just to see S.K. Thoth prayform. I saw the documentary of sorts on youtube about him. He's a very interesting character. And I don't say 'character' to demean him and his experience, I say it because everyone is a character of sorts in my own experience. The interesting ones are my favorites! He prayforms soloperas about a character/land/people that he made up in his youth. He even sings in the language of the land-which he totally made up!, and he dresses in costume from the land! He does this all while playing violin and providing percussion with his feet. I saw it and was fascinated by his story and the beauty of the character's story, his prayformances, and his bravery to be true to himself and free despite the risk and often actuality of others' misunderstanding and misinterpretation of him. That's some hard shit to do some times, but this dude does it all the time. He gets mad respect and admiration from me yo!<br />So, we'll see where the next 2 years life takes me. I'll go wherever it takes me. I do have this uncanny ability and determination to make a way for the things that I want though <img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/satisfied.gif"" /></p>"

"event","<br /><p>Well really from Sunday but...we all know how I can't keep track of time properly enough! Anyway, so I had to go to work to help set up the ad. I was surprisingly awake and functional for 5 in the am. I know people go to work early and I'm not the only one, but getting up that early interferes with my natural nocturnality. Its different staying up that late then going to bed than it is to unsuccessfully go to bed earlier to be able to get up that&nbsp;early. But I digress. I had the food section in my store to put up signs. We also have our seasonal section in that same section, so I got to put up sale signs for Halloween candy! I'm not a huge huge candy freak, but I was so excited to see all that candy! Some of it was like taking a trip back to the day yo. I was like &quot;Oh junk, caramel apple lollis, I haven't seen these junks in ever! And the little pumpkin candies! And caramel candy corn?! I bet its with that yuuuuhhh! Dum dums-good shite!!!&quot;. I thought to myself &quot;I'm buyin a shitload of this yo to give out to trick or treaters this year.&quot;. I wanted to buy it then and there but the store wasn't open yet and if I bought Halloween candy this early and brought it into my house the kiddies <em>totally</em> wouldn't even have it because my fam would glush it all.<br />So I had help finishing the signs in that section, then we went out to the garden center to help set up ad out there. I swear I have ADD yo 'cause I was amazed by everything out there. (Hell, I was amazed at everything that day, but still!) It was interesting because-we come in at 5am to do ad, has to be done by 8am when the store opens, garden was getting an ad&nbsp;visit that day, the person who was setting up didn't come in until 7 and had never done ad before, <em>AND</em> all the signs were general as fuck. I couldn't locate them when I was prepping the rest of the ad because it didn't even have a functional dpci that I could turn into a upc to look up. But we still had to scan them in!! We had to go around and scan the plants to see whether&nbsp;they were on sale or not. This took 3 of us a bit more than an hour, I don't know how they expected it to be done by 1 person in that time yo. And&nbsp;the other person that was helping and me totally just about didn't know what plant from what because the signs were like &quot;15% off patio ready plants&quot; and etc, and we were like &quot;Which fucking one can't you put on your patio?! What do they mean 'patio ready'?&quot;, and they didn't exactly have signs saying &quot;patio ready&quot; hangin up over a section of plants yo. It was fun. One section of&nbsp;greenery looked like a jungle and we half expected snakes to crawl out, monkeys to swing by, and hear strange bird calls. Then there were these ferns that were furry lookin which I&nbsp;felt the need to share with everybody as I stared at them in wonder and fright with my finger hesitant to touch/poke it. And the door to the garden center kept opening and it would push the cart further and further away from it, which was kinda funny to me for some reason. There was also this&nbsp;beautifully huge, bright red hibiscus flower that kept staring at me and saying &quot;Pick me!! Tuck me behind your ear!&quot; and I was like &quot;But no, they'll see us! The guests and leaders might not like it.&quot;. The other chick kept thinking something was gonna jump out of the flowers and stuff at her, and everythime she&nbsp;saw a spider or something crawly she'd say &quot;Eeeewwww!&quot; and just about run away!&nbsp;We kept thinking&nbsp;lizards were gonna fall on our heads too 'cause they were crawling on the gate on the top and there's space where it could crawl through-or fall through if it was going too fast and not paying attention! The garden center chick was like &quot;Don't hurt any of the lizards! I have one that's my pet.&quot; and the other chick was like &quot;If your lizard jump on me then I'm going to kill it!&quot;. It was funnier with her accent too! Oh, she also kept freaking out about the spider webs that we kept walking into-that was funny yo! Speaking of spider webs-we have some Halloween decor outside as well. There's really cool lookin gargoyle statues and a fountain, this gate that has a bat on the front of it, a few wire arbors and pumpkins and stuff. I was trying to put up signs on these things (which was hard because they don't exactly have shelves to hook the signs on to), and there were spider webs on some of them. This gave them an added Halloween look which was awesome! The best spectacular was seeing the webs with the light from early morning sun reflecting off of them-especially on the wire arbor! It was a nice effect.<br />We went back in the store once we were done-right as the corporate visitor came up to check things out. (I've never liked visits, regardless of my position or what they're visiting for. It always makes me nervous-even if I know everything's flawless.) We were happy to get out of there. I helped push some product on the sales floor-which I was dorkily excited about since I'm always trapped in the bowels of the store to get my work done (while flirting with death nonetheless. It makes everything interesting? Good thing I'm not claustrophobic. If my mind wasn't right&nbsp;[Ha!]&nbsp;then it'd be enough to make me!). We passed the Halloween costumes and I was like &quot;These costumes are crappy. I want this pirate jacket for everyday wear!&quot; lol Finally 10 in the am rolled around and I was done with work. I was excited even though it was a short shift and I had to be up super mega early. I think because it went by so fast since I was busy (I've a tendency throughout my 'career' to play mind&nbsp;tricks of sorts whenever I'm&nbsp;working to make the time go by faster. I like to work a big chunk of my shift, break from it, then the rest of the day goes faster than my grandma's caramel cake)&nbsp;and because I was out so early. <br />Then I go home. Then I sleep some good sleep to make up for the craptastic sleep I got the night before. My mom came to wake me up so we could go pick up my sisters from work (ha ha to them-I was leaving work when they were gettting ready to go in!) and go grocery shopping. (Ps-I'm really sorry to you dear reader for troubling you with the...strangeties? of my mind and trivialities of my day. If you've made it this far then I appreciate your brave interest.) I was having a dream that I don't fully remember, I just know it had a song in it. The song was one that I totally made up and it was in the vein of System of a Down mixed with Skindred. It was about candy pirates and some war they were gonna start-I think about their candy lol And I knew the song word for word, first verse through the chorus! It was stuck in my head when I woke up too, but I knew this to be the vestiges of my dream. Even though I knew the words with such clarity I&nbsp;knew this was a&nbsp;fleeting moment and that I wouldn't remember them later on. But it was extremely funny! I keep kinda getting the music stuck in my head and all I hear is &quot;We like candy, we like...&quot;, and I see some crazy rockstar pirate eat-singing into the microphone from underneath it of sorts.</p><p>In short, I'm way too excited about Halloween XD</p>"

I remember I confused some when I said I was the antithesis of a self-aware robot, meaning simply I felt more like a robot than a human, and I wanted to be more like a robot so I wouldn't have to deal with feeling and emotion. Now, I still don't&nbsp;necessarily like those things, but I think they kinda make me wanna abandon my observationist's post and...participate in life. Probably mostly for the experience but experience it nonetheless. I'm now the self aware robot who realizes that they are more than their robot counterparts, but less than their human counterparts, who wants to be human, is frustrated by inabilities and limitations, and trapped by the futility of their desire. Fuck, and I'm human already! Imagine how that robot must feel!! Well I don't have to to some extent for various reasons, but still. I've still got this human streak that someone painted on me and I gotta learn how it functions. Its not in my Jetbot 3000 manual.</p>"

"event","I found an anime meetup in Fort Myers!!! I'm tempted to join 'cause then I'll have someone to talk to stuff about, get recommendations and insight and such from. I'd probably just listen and stuff at first but it'd be nice to have people to geek out with about cosplay/manga/anime! I looked for a Harry Potter one but nobody made one yet. Ft. Myers isn't as cool yo. People still have to hide unless there's an event that draws 'em out! And its so old people here yo! They're tryin to expand and grow-hell, world sailing championships are bein held here next year! Dunno anything about sailing but I wanna go. I'd rather that than the golf tournaments they've had around. Its either crap like that or party in the club, so if you're not the party in the club type youth then you're stuck. Or maybe I'm just old for a youth?! Maybe I like my house a little too much. Then again, no I don't, 'cause there's never fucking anything to do around here!! Concert every once in a while but nothin else much is bangin. If I had my license and a car (well I have the second but its more of a family thing. I can't just be like &quot;I'm goin to Orlando today, sucks for you guys doesn't it?!&quot;) I probably would never be home. I'd be at a concert or convention!!! Or something. Maybe I'm just restless? Maybe I should go back to school? For what though?! That has complications in and of itself as well. Or maybe I just made it that way? I'd always thought myself to be older than my fellow 23 year old counterparts when it came to taking care of myself, so the perception of college students as being incapable of being self sufficient always pissed me off. Then after I lost my job at Hallmark and began contemplating the future...I felt as young and inexperienced as a coddled child goin off to school as ever, and it freaked me out yo. I always feel so much more experienced than my peers and simultaneously more inexperienced&nbsp;than them as well.

Wow, I went from anime meetup to life ponderances. That's just how my brain works folks!

I'm goin to bed.

"event","<br />So much stuff going onnnnn...in my head!! How <em>do </em>I cope? I really don't know, but it's kinda fun =D<br /><br />So I'm getting a friend's tv on Friday and I'm gonna have some extra money so I think I'm <em>FINALLY</em> gonna go buy Kingdom Hearts 1 &amp; 2! I've wanted to play for a long time and I didn't realize that the game which is so popular was the same one I saw on Disney one night some years back and wrote down on a piece of paper so I wouldn't forget the name lol! (Dammit I should really start sleeping more 'cause I keep making so many typos its ridiculous! I caught 'em, but still. I feel like an idiot person typing and I can't <em>stand</em> when people misspell things, especially myself.) I also got this really cute dress that if you saw it maybe you'd be like &quot;Chi-Chi? You're wearing that?! It SOOO not you!&quot; (if you know me. Trust me, I shocked the shit out of my family when they saw it), and I'd be like &quot;Why yes I am damn you!&quot;. I call it my &quot;In it to win it!&quot; dress 'cause it looks like something a little homemaker mom from the&nbsp;fifties would have worn. I keep imagining an old school commercial with a mom&nbsp;holding an apple pie or a plate of food and a&nbsp;smile. I'm planning on entering the Pillsbury Bake-Off&nbsp;whenever the next one is-I think 2010 but I may have to enter next year-and I keep talking about winning it ('cause I will! If I keep <em>thinking</em> about the million dollars <em>being</em> mine then it <em>will</em> be mine!! *evil 'rule the world' glint and smile*), so I said I was gonna wear that when I win and actualize my imagination. The only thing is the top half is tight and the bottom fits fine. Like siriusly if I wanted to straighten my posture I could put it on a few times a week! It is a size 14-and I am not-but the way I'm constructed I can actually get away with the bottom because it's A-line and leaves room for my big hips. I think if I put some effort I can either lose weight to fit it or hack it and alter it to fit. Or wear a girdle? Yar. But I digress. I might actually buy some manga that I've been wanting to read since I have extra money!!! I've been wanting to forever, but that's how long I've been poor.<br /><br />My fucking eye keeps twitching!! <br /><br />Just saw Office Space finally. That movie is great! I didn't even wanna go pee 'cause I didn't wanna miss anything! But my bladder won toward the end.<br /><br />I'm also planning to go to Key West for my birthday next year. My sisters and 2 cousins whose birthdays are in the same week (2/5, 2/6, and 2/8) are all going (that feels like deja vu 'cause I've said this before to someone or somewhere else recently). I decided I wanna get a tattoo when I'm there-'cause its my birthday and I'll be in Key West!-but I'm still not sure about it. I don't fully know what I want yet or where but...I've a few months and things are finally starting to actualize somewhat after all these years. If it turns out ti be expensive then I'll just go somewhere here when I get back-'cause it'll still be my birthday then!!! This one place I saw someone told me it was $100 and hour. I'm like &quot;Wtf?!?! By the hour?!&quot; I've been a few places around town just lookin and they charged by the size and color of the piece. I dunno if I can handle by the hour. If I'm ever payin by the hour then I'd probably be getting my whole back tattooed or something intricately detailed. I still really want the little circle/wheel thing from Incubus. Its not really their logo or anything popular I don't believe but it was on a few shirts and in the video for &quot;Stellar&quot; and tinily on the back of the sleeve and case for Make Yourself. That's the one I want but I'm not too wild about how the white would turn out-especially since its not&nbsp;even guaranteed to show up on white people, and I'm&nbsp;darker than that-so I don't wanna get it in white. But for me, I'd have to replace that color with another color to go with the green and purple that wouldn't jack it up <em>or </em>change the colors completely, but I can't think of any right off rip that would work that I'd like. I thought about red and black but...dunno. Maybe with yellow? Or red, yellow, and orange? I do like red, black, and blue but...I'm not sure how that would look together. Plus, I've never personally seen anybody/Incubus fan with a tattoo of it so I like to think I'm being different lol There's other Incubus stuff I want but I don't wanna feel like a copycat/drone. Though I don't think anybody has this one flower that's in From the Murks of the Sultry Abyss *ponders*<br /><br />Bah, contemplation! I'm going to bed now 'cause I gotta work tomorrow. I've been off the past 4 days and stayin up super into the next day late because I knew I was off. Didn't mean to stay up this late, but at least I go in 10-3 tomorrow (which in itself isn't great either but). I gotta remember to go by Joann's and apply too ('cause I really wanna work there as a second job! They're classes are free to employees and I can learn to sew!).<br /><br />Scratches!"

"event","Ozemgeez so today we had some sort of family gathering of sorts for Labor Day. First off, my family's fucked up-just as anyone else's I know, and they always try to organize events so we can have a real family reunion like with lots of food and out of town travel and t-shirts and traditions that get carried down through the generations and stuff. That would all be nice if we were actually organized and disciplined enough to do that. Other than that they mostly turn out as attempts at those things which still somehow end up being fun-sometimes depending on who's there. Its like one of those things you know is gonna happen 'cause it never fails to do so no matter how hard you try to change it so it becomes futile but you still do it anyway. I think that we should just accept the fact that we're more like Earth Art which is good for as long as it lasts and is fleeting rather than a solid work of art that&nbsp;endures&nbsp;the test of time. I personally find it pointless to expect things to&nbsp;perform otherwise than how they've consistently performed. Usually it leads to dissatisfaction and other emotions I'd rather not deal with,&nbsp;because if you expected it&nbsp;then why are you upset about it?!?! &nbsp;There's nothing wrong with trying, don't get me wrong! Not trying is even more a crime than trying unsuccessfully! And even though you might expect certain things don't pigeonhole something and not leave room for error in the correctness of your expectations one way or the other. I'm just saying that eventually there comes a point where its not so surprising when something turns out how you thought it would. That's when maybe its time to go with the flow. Or go for radical change?<br />But I digress! I realized today that I love my family even more when they cook! I know it sound very basic and fat kid but its true. My more immediate family like grandma, aunts, uncles, mom, me, and my sisters. I know we cook like the bomb yo! And trust me, I am actually objective about food I eat from other family members outside of the aforementioned-I treat them just like I would a non-family member's cooking. And some of the people in my family can't cook!!! They all know how to eat, about half of that knows how to cook, and maybe another half of <em>that</em> is talented at it =D Siriusly, I sell out my other family members who don't cook as well as me and people I like! I feel bad for some of my cousins and the things they've had to eat growing up and have called food! You can tell which ones those are when you make the most simplest dish or a simple twist or you personally consider it a crappy suffice that you could've done better and they're freakin blown away by it as if they've never eaten before! lol Its so funny! And I'm not claiming to be the greatest-I have off moments and some stuff is foreign territory and some stuff other people do better than me. But the validation comes when people eat...and either can't stop eating or can't shut up about it or can't get enough. And that's good enough for me!<br />I like to think that the reason I love my family more when they cook is because they put so much love in their food! Trust me, love makes a difference in how food tastes yo. If this sounds crazy to you then you've never really eaten. Ever. Most everybody likes a home cooked meal...unless their parents cooked shitty, then they want someone else's! But still. Why though? 'Cause it's got love in it!!!! Love food is the shit yo! You can't buy love food at McDonald's! Love food makes you nostalgic...for more love food! For example, my&nbsp;whole family always goes insane for my grandma's caramel cake. She used to make it from scratch-both caramel and cake, but she's a little older now and has a few more aches and pains that she didn't used to so she can't do that as much anymore like she used to. She used to make cakes to say thank you and show appreciation to people for stuff they did and people started requesting cakes and even offering to pay for them! Like I said though, not so much anymore unfortunately. She uses boxed cake mix but still makes the caramel, and even though I personally prefer the old back in the day from scratch cake, the cheat cakes are still good! (I will get her to teach me how to make a cake from scratch! Maybe I can bring back ger cream cheese pound cake from back in the day?!)&nbsp;We helped her make the cakes on Sunday night and took 2 to the event. There was also a chocolate cake there and a pineapple upside down cake. When everybody started finishing up eating and goin for sweets I actually heard family members say &quot;Let me get me a piece of Flora cake 'fo its all gone!&quot;. Everybody knows what time it is and what's gonna happen when Flora bring some caramel cake-first come, first served, every man for himself, you better hope she brought more than one or that somebody will be willin to share-which isn't likely! I ate my slice and told some of my family &quot;Now this what food made with love taste like!&quot; lol By the time clean up came a whole caramel cake was already gone, the second only had about 4-6 slices left, the chocolate cake still had one piece left that was there for the longest, and the pineapple upside down cake was picked at if even that! We were able to bring both cake dishes home empty =) My family's love laced food just makes you feel good! It makes you feel like it was&nbsp;crafted just for you with lots of time and care. Makes you feel like they intended for you to enjoy it and they made it 'cause they wanted to. It makes you feel like they love you. And with every bite you appreciate it and love them too =D"

So I woke up a few weeks ago with an awesome ass song stuck in my head for no apparent reason. Its okay, it happens a lot, regadless of time of day or consciousness. I was itching to hear the song because I kept hearin it in my head and I really like it a lot, and usually when that thing happens I have to, have to, have to hear the song or everything will be damned to hell for like 2 seconds. lol! Oh by the way the song is &quot;Island of Wonder&quot; by Nelly Furtado. Anyway, I turns on the computador and goes on to my iTunes while I'm getting ready for work. I sacrificed time from getting ready for work to find this song yo! Everything finally loads up and I have a few curls in and I come back to check. I was too anxious to scroll down to it so I did a search for it...and it didn't come up!!! I was crushed! Then I even tried playlist.com and myflashfetish.com and searched for it to no avail. I had to continue for a few more days with that song stuck in my head and I couldn't even hear it outside my head =(
(Begin current scene) I'm listenin to my iTunes again and stuffs just playin through. I found my way to Nelly Furtado and was like &quot;Sweet! I'll listen to &quot;Explode&quot; 'cause its got Mikey and Jose from Incubus!&quot; After that played I scrolled down...... AND FOUND &quot;ISLAND OF WONDER&quot;!!!!! Joyous victory!!! I put it on repeat then wondered why I couldn't find it the other day when I searched it?!?! Must've been 'cause it was morning yo. I'm not usually &quot;awake&quot; before between 11am and 1pm if I'm not in bed because that's about when I wake up voluntarily on an off day.

"event","&nbsp;(That song is awesome! My sister's so awesome too! Continue reading to find out why)<br />&nbsp;<br />Since I don't have much in the way of Harry Potter and other stuff I obsess over I needed a new one. And I found it watching the olympics! I'm currently obsessed with my newest husband Michael Phelps. Not just because he's a super olympian and breaks records. He swims beautifully! I was mesmerized! And he was so humble about winning. And he's a mama's boy! Plus his mom's reaction's were so great-especially the men's 100m butterfly (I think, I'll go check later) where he won by <em>ONE HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND!!!!!!</em> Siriusly, I think he's Brandon Boyd 2 yo. And I already told Olivia that he's comin to Utah! I keep threatening to move to Maryland so I can marry him and have baby dolphins and cook for him (he likes to eat, I like to cook; he eats grits, I can cook grits-my sister won't eat anybody's but my mom's-or mine!!!!) and listen to Outkast and Lil Wayne and stuff. Plus its Maryland!! I was obsessed with Maryland back in the day (and Italy and Spain), I love Ace of Cakes and that's where Charm City Cakes is, and its close to Virginia which I could give a whole other set of reasons for that being awesomely great. And the next summer olympics is gonna be in London!!!!! I don't even need to say anymore about that yo! Coincidence? No my friends, that's synchronicity! Haha! There's more stuff (How shocking! How could one have ever known without me saying so?! Right.&nbsp;If you know me then you know better.) but I'll quell my inner geek that comes up with things when I have time to think of more stuff and spare you. lol!<br />Anyway, I've been buying up like every magazine I can find with him on it/in it yo. I bought 6 magazines within the past 5 days to a week and 4 of them had my new favorite Phelps on/in them! And I wish I would've gotten the pre-olympics Sports Illustrated because the cover is awesomely hot! And its just his face!!! How sad?! lol My sister went to the hospital for her sinuses/throat hurting etc. Turns out she had a sinus infection-or that's what one person said. Another said it might be strep throat-but that was the nurse and not the doctor. Anyway, my sister calls me and is like ""I got a present for you when I get home"" and I'm like ""For me? What?"". She took the ESPN magazine with Michael Phelps on the cover for me! I cracked up laughing, felt bad, but was excited.<br />I was looking at my wall today and surveying my posters. I've 2 Harry Potter prints, an Outkast poster, a Dave Matthews print (which I need to put backup), the awesome birthday collage Olivia made for my 18th? birthday (yes, I still have that yo!), a System of a Down poster, and an Incubus poster (underneath which I sleep =D hee, hee). I think I'm gonna make a Michael Phelps collage now to go with it. Eventually. lol Or I'll just get that SI cover reprint and add it!"

"event","More like an attempt to give organization to the thoughts that swim around with each other in my head and to make more room for more kids in the mind pool (and tire myself back to sleep maybe?). I chose the list form because, well, I'm a huge fan of that form! (AND post-it notes! Both those things got me through my heyday as a manager yo!&nbsp;But that's beside the point lol) Not that I'd have to explain why to&nbsp;make you read and understand or care-do so as you please-but still.&nbsp;

*People are so absurdly selfish and sometimes its kinda funny.
*I think I would like to maybe dabble in writing-creative writing in particular. I find myself being drawn more to my fictional and fantastical side. I've generally shunned it in favor of my general realism side but now its becoming quite interesting, though I don't know why. I'll thank anime and manga in part I think. I've had a few ideas in the past few months to maybe a year if even that. Just gotta write them down! Yaarrrr! Sometimes I wish my mind had one of those pens with a chain on it like at the bank or so, so that way whenever I had an idea I could write it down and not risk forgetting it! Then I could revisit it later and play dress up with it.
*I wanna compete in the Pillsbury Bake-Off! Again, I've ideas but haven't gotten around to them yet. At least I don't get distracted by internalising when I cook so this one will be a little bit easier to do. I think I'd have to worry more about nerves on this one. Cooking is so much fun though! Someday I'd like to cook for you all. Until then I gotta come up with my million dollar recipe yo 'cause I'm in it to win it!
*Anybody have any good book recommendations?! I've been reading a lot more lately-which I'm happy about. The downside-I have nothing to read! I'm thinkin about rekindling my relationship with the library so...
*I've a confession that has been years in the making which I think I'm ready to make. Or at least I want to be, but I still, after all these years, can't find words to express. Though I'm not as certain if I want what I wanted so much anymore. I'm worried that I lost it anyway and that maybe I've idealised for so long that maybe reality doesn't match as much as it used to. I have to get it out but I don't want to be inconsiderate or make things awkward, especially since we don't communicate often."

Sometimes I wish I didn't care so much because then it'd be over and done and I could move on. Until then I'm stuck towards progress?"

"event","Fuck everybody yo. I'm tired. Tired of people. Wanting things for me, wanting things from me, and expecting a stand and deliver everytime. Unnecessary things. Things that I can't get because I have to get what I needed because they asked for help. My family helps out when we can however we can. There've been plenty of times that we haven't exactly been in the best position to help but we did anyway. We went without to help someone else who was without. Every fucking time though that we may need help who's there to do so? No fucking body! That's why I don't ask for help because its consistently failed. We don't have the luxury of someone we can depend on or lean on should we need help. All we have is each other to lean on and depend on, and we still manage to think about others even though nobody cares about us. Then people have the nerve to ask why we don't have this or why we don't do that, or worse they tell us we should or complain about it. Fucking if I wasn't helpin your ass I could! Are you gonna give me what you want me to have so badly?! You gonna help me out so I can fucking get it?! NO, you already fuckin proved that! We can barely even help ourselves and you still want us to help you regardless. No consideration. Fuckin selfish ass leeches! I'm doing the best that I can so why should it bother you. I'm not askin you for anything and I'm fine without what I don't have so why are you complainin? If you're not a part of the situation or going to help the situation then you can sit back and shut the fuck up cause you don't really have anything to say. And when you think you do think about the fact that I don't care and I don't wanna hear it."

"event","So I was logged in to aim as usual-I always go on but no one talks to me because I swear nobody remembers/knows that my screenname exists, plus I never&nbsp;talk to anybody for fear of them being freaked out and/or forced conversation. You can only say hi, how are you, et cetera blah so many times. I have my stalkerish reasons to go on though lol! Anyway, tonight I get and&nbsp;IM from some random person that tells me to read a book. I'm like ""What the fuck?! Ok? Maybe I know this person? Or maybe I don't? Let's find out kinda."" So I IM back 'you read a book!"". Back and forth random&nbsp;shite we go. I was playfully guarded and refrained from full on condescending detachment. This person calls my screenname weird and attempts to make fun of it, asks me for a picture, male or female, why I pissed off their friend amanda, if I had a myspace and if I knew someone named hemingway, and tried to correct my askance of questions. This person even tried to argue with me over whether or not I'd asked previously if I knew them and that I didn't tell them to read a book though I clearly had it on my screen in front of me! Then this person told me stuff that I'd told...it that I clearly had not. I'm like ""What the fuck? Ok whatever."". I find out that one of their friends, this hemingway I presume,&nbsp;posted a bulletin (I assume on myspace) saying that someone had pissed off their friend amanda and gave my screenname and told them to annoy that person, and this puppet was following orders. Fucking douchebag mindless drone ass teenagers yo! I don't know how old this particular person or group of persons was, but you could tell that they were childish enough to stoop to a fucking low ass level of cyberbullying BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE TOLD THEM TO! How dumb! I hate to underestimate people for stereotypical factors against them, such as age, but sometimes people just don't fail to stand and deliver. I love the part where this person abruptly logged of so that I couldn't respond. NICE! Way to avenge your friend there buddy! And this person wasn't even sure if I was the right person they were supposed to be annoying nor did they succeed in annoying me. Amuse-yes, annoy-not so much. I've a pretty high tolerance for annoyingness anyway. Ignorance and idiocy on the other hand, they may be friends of each other, but they're definitely not friends of mine. I'm honestly more annoyed about the fact that this person/group thought this to be the most effective way of avenging their friend than I am about this randomositous conversation. (I never get ""mad"" for the right things yo! My meter must be positioned differently than other people's. When we got...harassed last year I was more upset by the fact that we were done so without reason than I was about the fact that I had been assaulted with a broom to the face. What is wrong with me?! lol). No wonder people get lured to houses and get their ass whooped-because there's this mindless syndrome that's infected this current generation of teenagers that turns them into weak, droning sheep. The culprits are too afraid-or maybe even too lazy-to think for themselves, and the victim's are to blind to defend themselves. Damn, I know every generation will think differently of and from one another, but we weren't that stupid! I can only hope that someday the sheep-agers will get tired of being counted and do something smart-like read a book ;-P&nbsp;"

Plus some stuff is too fun and I have to share! I'll usually try to remember to warn you so that those of you who know me on more than one place don't have to suffer redundancy unless you so choose. Enjoy!**<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;How in the why in the hell does peanut butter manage to stay on your breath or so for so long?!?! Did it stick to my fuckin esophagus as it went down? Are particles of it parasiting themselves on to the air coming out of my mouth? Its like my burps are being taken over by this peanut butter virus yo! Hours ago I ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (yes that's right, throwbacks, ooh!). <em>HOURS</em> I tell you, <em>hours!!! </em>ago I tell you.&nbsp;Do you <em>see</em> what time this is written?! I cannot stress how long ago I ate peanut butter. Fuck, I don't even remember what time it was when I ate it that's how long ago (then again time, my brain, and their awareness of each other&nbsp;share quite an interesting relationship. Sometimes they join&nbsp;forces and play tricks on me and my sanity... I mean certainty, so I can't always be quite sure of happenings and such. But still!!&nbsp;I have my moments.) it was. Hours passed and I burped. What did it taste like? Peanut butter. No big deal though, only a few short hours have passed right? Then comes a turkey and cheese sandwich. That oughtta show that pb&amp;j sandwich who's boss!! Its meat, yarrr! Then I bring on some kool-aid, and later water. No way it could've survived. Or could it? Oh, wait, it did. I swear peanut butter is fucking ninja-especially since I made turkey and cheese pirates. Anyway, the kool-aid must've joined forces with turk&amp;chee (ha, chi!) because the water HAD to have joined forces with pb&amp;j because it knows that I burp a lot whenever I drink water for some reason (or when eat&nbsp;mint, but mint was&nbsp;nowhere to be found for&nbsp;this fight. Chicken loser!), and it used this knowledge against me, turk, chee, and kool-aid (maybe I should've drank some mint kool-aid to even the playing field?) to help pb&amp;j plan its escape. Or rather just peanut butter. Jelly's not as ninja. I think it became scared and turned into...well itself-it is what it is!, so there's no way it would have been as cool a ninja as peanut butter. Couldn't make it past the first stage of Ultimate Ninja. But peanut butter was determined to make it to the last stage! But I digress. Anyway, end scene, all else fail, peanut butter prevails and with water's aid escapes, and I still taste peanut butter burps much to no avail.<br />&nbsp;More hours pass. Then comes...DINNER!!!!! *gasp* Its fuckin dinner yos,&nbsp;<em>DINNER!!!!&nbsp;</em>That pb&amp;j was so long ago it should be merely a memory upon my breath. Key words-should be. Was it? No! (Why else would I&nbsp;be telling this story?!) I even (totally unconsciously) thought I&nbsp;leveled the playing ground with a worthy opponent by having chicken fried rice for dinner!!!! How (unconsciously) mistaken I was.&nbsp;I ate, they had at it with each other, and I totally thought cfr&nbsp;had pwninated pb&amp;j. I even drank some more kool-aid and cfr invited it to join&nbsp;its party and they went in to take down the pb&amp;j boss. But I was still thirsty so I drank...SOME&nbsp;MORE WATER!!!! Now cfr and kool-aid were doing&nbsp;alright against the pb&amp;j boss,&nbsp;but then they somehow aggroed water and totally wiped after that. While they were taking out water minions pb&amp;j regained health&nbsp;and dominated them with a mokeystomp thunderclap. One hit 'em to the instant graveyard! Sucked their health with the blinding quickness! Neither cfr or&nbsp;kool-aid were pally so they couldn't bubble hearth, and they didn't have any healers so...<br />&nbsp;And now its after 3 am and I still...have...peanut butter burps!!!! I mean, bologna makes your breath taste worse than this but it doesn't stick with you that long!!&nbsp;I swear, that must be why. Different consistency-bologna doesn't stick. Maybe I should eat some chocolate?! Seems like it'd be stronger than that&nbsp;chicken jelly was. And I gotta find something else other than water (and kool-aid?)&nbsp;to drink. At least until the peanut butter clears.&nbsp;</p>"

And the music was really great as well in both movies. I kinda like the music for the 1st a bit more than the 2nd-1 was more actiony and cybery/electronicy, 2 was more worldy and chill, which fit 'cause that one took the story outside of the utopia of Olympus (note to self/anyone interested: utopia does not exist or at least it doesn't last for long.&nbsp;Haters <em>always</em> gotta fuck it up from either the inside or the out and completely defeat the purpose! Why?! Why you gotta fuck with utopianity?! Fuckin haters<img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/devious.gif"" />&nbsp; But I digress.) to encompass other nations/countries. I like both though and aspire to own both soundtracks someday. </div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;A few songs stuck out either because of the sound or because of synchronizing with certain scenes. I searched extensively online for the track listings and samples from both so I could identify the songs that I liked! One of them was ""Rescue"" by Hasymo-it sounded Depeche Mode-y, and I likes the&nbsp;Depeche Mode! (thanks Candy!) Its been on and off stuck in my head since! There was also ""Puzzle-Riddle""&nbsp;by Lina Ohta. Both these played at the end of Ex Machina. Then there's ""Dive For You"" by Boom Boom Satellites-which is my current obsession (both song and band. They had another song on there called ""Underdog"" which I rather enjoyed as well. Couldn't find it.)!!! I absolutely had to find that song&nbsp;else I'd be driven to insanity!&nbsp;I <em>love, <font size=""3"">love, </font></em><font size=""6""><em>LOVE! </em></font><font size=""2"">when I love a song that much yo. But anyway. I made a playlist with it on there-which is currently on my page (myspace) if you'd like to take a listen, downloaded it on my phone, listened to it on repeat at least 4 different times the other day for who knows how long each time, and even hunted down the lyrics to post. It such an amazing song! I find the singer's voice appealing. Plus, watching Appleseed-Briareos and Deunan were constantly saving each other because one didn't want to lose the other (again/in some way shape, or form). They were fiercly loyal in loving each other yo. Anyway, one of the times when I think Briareos was saving Deunan from something (I've to watch the movie again!), I think she was falling down from/to something and he went to catch/get her. As he was going the music started, and just as he got her you hear the song's opening line ""I would dive for you"" playing through "" No one else compares, no one compares to you"". Bloody fucking BRILLIANT!!! Especially also because I first thought the line was ""die for you"" instead, which I think still would have worked. I almost wanted to cry for girlish reasons. (Though I could be wrong about some of this, I do remember definitely falling, going after and catching/catching up to, and ""Dive For You"" for sure!). Anyway, here's the lyrics-enjoy! I'm gonna go find somebody to dive for (el oh el)</font></div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">Dive For You-Boom Boom Satellites</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: verdana"" align=""left"">I would dive for you<br />I would dive for you<br />Good times are rollin'<br />Bad things are not here<br />No one else compares<br />No one compares to you<br /><br />I would dive for you<br />I would dive for you<br />Good times are rollin'<br />Bad things are not here<br />No one else compares<br />No one compares to you<br /><br />I would dive for you<br />Feeling like I'm hypnotized<br />Make me what I am<br />Make me who I be<br />Time of my life now<br />Time of my life now, man<br /><br />I would dive for you<br />I would dive for you<br /><br />See you next life time and push me<br />I can be what you want me to be girl<br /><br />See you next life time and push me<br />I can be what you want me to be girl<br /><br />See you next life time and push me<br />I can be what you want me to be girl<br /><br />See you next life time<br />See you next life time and<br />See you next life time<br />And push me<br /><br />I can be what you want me to be girl<br />I can be what you want me to be girl<br />I can be what you want me to be girl </div>"

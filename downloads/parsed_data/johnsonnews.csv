"event","We finally got the call from the doctor's office...  Calvin does NOT have mono.  Yay.  Of course, that didn't keep him from coming home early AGAIN...  

So the score is: one asleep, one playing, one fussy/crying/yelling/driving Mama to distraction.  Mama, 0.  Not one thing have I finished today.  The house is the  pits, badly needed groceries litter the kitchen, laundry is molding in the washer, and I am frazzled.  I do not like having sick kids.  Especially when they can't tell me what is wrong.  :(

It is a day for a milkshake.  I already had it, it was the best. milkshake. EVER.  'Cause if you're going to get a shake, you might as well go to <a href= ""http://www.steakandshake.com/default-home.asp"">Steak N Shake</a>, right?  It was a special Halloween one:  ""Dark Chocolate and Double Fudge"".  (On the linked page it's the middle one in the trio shown on the left sidebar.)  Yummy.


Best. Milkshake. EVER.

Especially for a chocolate fix on a bad day.  Of course, the day was mostly bad due to the rain.  And the fact that I hadn't been shopping this week due to Sick Kid.  So for a rainy day I spent very little time home until nowish.

So, now I try to get the house to recover and prepare myself for Tuesday."

She's over 12 pounds now, and I swear she is working on teething.  Sometimes she's just fussy- but she might be starting to fight sleeping.  Last night she actually sucked on my pinky for a while.  :)  She will have her 4 month checkup Wednesday morning.

We were just in there, too- Calvin and Sweetheart got flu shots Friday afternoon.  Calvin was pretty good- only one cry- and Sweetheart didn't really react at all.

Calvin is reading more and more, and Sweetheart is coming up with new words almost every day.  Sometimes we even know what she's saying.  Kitten is flipping better and more often, and will grab things now with her New and Improved Kung-Fu Death Grip.  Sometimes they even head toward her mouth.

And since Daddy is now home with dinner, it is time for me to go.  Here's to a new week!"

"event","Calvin made a pattern of foam pieces today, it's listed above.  He also ended on Blue, and even made it through the entire day without being sent home sick!  I knew he was ready for school when he started getting in trouble at home again.  ;p

We had a great visit from Grandmommy, Granddaddy and GrandDadDad this weekend.  We talked, relaxed, and enjoyed the kids- and they enjoyed the attention.  Mommy even got to go spend her birthday money!  :D  A box was opened from Papa and Mema, clothes were admired, and Calvin added his new Transformer to the flock.

Sweetheart has been in the naming business lately, labeling who sits where in the car as well as people.  She has words for characters now and she took the opportunity to label our visitors.  Grandmommy became ""Mimi"" and GrandDadDad became ""Dada"".  One of the sets of clothing in the box from Papa and Mema was an Elmo set for Calvin...  and Sweetheart adopted it.  At least the shirt.  She even fought me this morning when I took it off, squirming and yelling ""Ah-mee""!!!  She recovered quickly though, and had a great morning at school.

Calvin seems to have had a good day too as he played soccer in PE today and got to feed geese with family friends after school... that I asked to pick him up because of the toilet.

Ok, the toilet.  The defining moment of my day.  The toilet in Calvin's bathroom has been leaking lately, and it reminded our visitors of a similar toilet leak that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage to the house I grew up in.  So, I called a plumber yesterday, and today we have a new toilet.  And a new water supply line.  It's all good, and warrantied for 30 days (labor) /1 yr. (toilet).  I just can't clean around it for 24 hours so that the caulking can dry.  Calvin returned home with our friends just as the plumber finished, but seems ok with having missed out on watching him work.  Just as well, there were saws involved with getting the old toilet out (rusty bolts holding it down).  In fact, they woke/scared Sweetheart- but she was ok sitting on Mommy's lap ""helping"" me with the computer.

And it's time for me to stop some Sister Thwarting."

Calvin: Size 6!  pants, shorts, t shirts, long sleeve shirts.  We have a couple dress shirts and a sweatshirt already.  Size 13! shoes: we only have a pait of tan/black sneakers, so a pair involving blue and any dress/church shoes would be needed.

Sweetheart:  Size 2: a light jacket.  Size 3! pajamas, tops without snaps/buttons in the neck.  Size 5! shoes, we only have some summery slipons, so she'll need 1-2 pr. sneakers, 1-2 pr sandals, and 2 pr church shoes.

and that was probably the worst diaper I've had to clean.  I almost gagged at it, but I'm not sure it was caused by the gluten as there was a lot of corn and the rest was pretty well integrated.  Her other ones are ""dirt and water"", this one was ""mud"".  And she did it within a half hour of waking up, too!  Better than waking up to that, though.
(end TMI)

Yes, Calvin's school is taking a bunch of K-1's to a Japanese steakhouse.  I'm not sure if they are nuts or not, but GA requires them to teach about the community <i>and</i> foreign cultures, so they are killing two birds with one field trip.  And they get to ride on yellow school buses again!

I am catching up on laundry today, then Mommy and Daddy (and Kitten) are going out while a sitter watches out for Calvin and Sweetheart- my goal is to get at least one to bed before we go.

There's not a lot of updating to make.  Sweetheart is adding new ""words"" every day- we just can't always figure out what they are.  She's signing better too.  A friend brought over some 24mo/2T clothes yesterday, all spring/summer stuff, but a couple things were usable now.  It's mostly dresses, and all cute!  Part of it was 3 sets of PJ's, 2 of which featured Elmo.  Sweetheart loves them.  She's only seen Elmo on TV a few times, but she can say it: ""eh-moh"", and wanted to nap with a pair.  Yikes, this girl likes characters!  She's also playing peekaboo back to us- she'll hide behind something and peek out, expecting you to say something to her.  It's so cute!

Kitten is progressing, too.  She's to the point where she <i>looks</i> like a baby and is sleeping more consistently.  If I time things right, she and Sweetheart will sleep at the same time for an hour or so in the afternoons before we pick up Calvin from school.  She's even done the 10pm-almost 7am sleep a few times now!  She hasn't done any more flipping, but she will bat at things a bit in the bouncy seat now.  Kitten is a pretty baby now.  She has a fair complexion, big blue eyes, and rosebud lips that are rather pink.  She's discovered fist chewing, and I saw her once the other day with a thumb in there.  She likes spit bubbles too.  Tummy time is still bad, though.  She cries through it, and through spinning around on her back.  She's progressing.  :)"

"event","because Calvin's love for Mickey and particularly Minnie continues.  Too bad this new show on Disney is more suited to Sweetheart than Calvin.  Shape matching, basic problem solving, colors...  it's in between the two.

Calvin finished up the week with Green days, so the tally is: 2 Blue, 2 Green, 1 Yellow for the week.  This is more like what I've expected for this point.  Since we reached 5 Blues this week we went to ""Mr. Tim's"" here in town and bought Calvin a new Transformer.  It looks like a spider and is called Black Arachnia, and he had it in mind before we left home.  We haven't opened it yet, so we'll find out how complex it is soon.

Calvin's progress report came home yesterday- he's halfway through his first grading period.  It looks like he is doing fine academically- decidedly above grade level in reading, at grade level in math, has understood all the concepts explored in science and social studies...  But he doesn't seem to play well with others and they see him playing mostly alone.  His handwriting and concentration have improved, and I hear him talk about playing with more and more kids at recess.  So, I think he's getting it and working on the things he needs to work on.  :)

Sweetheart seems to have eaten something that has given her another attack of The Diahrrea.  In fact, there's some on the living room floor now, so it's time for me to go.  

Next week Caedmon will tour our local Publix and eat lunch at a Japanese steakhouse with the rest of the K-1 classes.  I wish I could go too!"

Calvin was fascinated, and helped empty and reload the fridge.  I believe it was a problem with the automatic defroster and it is fixed- the ice cream is staying frozen.  :)

I weighed the girls again today.  Sweetheart was 22 lbs., 6 oz. and Kitten was 12 lbs., 1.5 oz.  We also went to Old Navy, since both the girls needed socks.  (Old Navy has the best socks!!)  Socks were found and were on sale even, as well as a romper for Kitten (covered in monkeys) and <a href= ""http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=6200&pid=417462&vid=1"">This Jacket</a> for Calvin (in a size 5, the tan color).  It will be good for this fall and winter, which means that he is done.  The jacket might even be able to be worn by the girls...  in a few years.  There was a little <a href= ""http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-INDIAN-PRINCESS-HALLOWEEN-COSTUME-OLD-NAVY-18-24-mo_W0QQitemZ290029536094QQihZ019QQcategoryZ80912QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"">Indian (Native American, you know...) Princess costume</a> that I almost got for Sweetheart.  We still don't know what she will be... and it's sold out online.  :(  A small dress and fairy wings would work too, if I knew it would be warm enough.

Sweetheart is quite good at demanding juice and cheese now, and also has words for Blue (from Blue's Clues) and Pooh (as in Winnie the Pooh).  They just sound the same.  

Calvin had a great time at his field trip, and even stayed on Blue!!  I got a call from the school nurse a bit ago saying that he was with her having a slight temperature and was acting quiet, that he said he'd had a sore throat earlier but it wasn't sore now.  She called me Friday morning with the same thing, so I'm thinking I might need to take Calvin in to the doctor and get him checked out.  I might be fighting the same thing, as I was feeling headachey yesterday and had a bit of rawness in my throat yesterday morning.  

My feeling bad yesterday was helped greatly by a little outside time with the kids.  It turned out to be nice out and they had a great time.  Sweetheart was riding on a toy across the driveway from the garage- just enough slope to be fun.  She also said ""whee"" to tell me she wanted to go on the Orange Whee in the backyard.  It appears that calling a slide a ""whee"" is somewhat universal.

Last note as I'm in a rush now:  Calvin brought home his first set of spelling exercises after taking his first test and scoring 100%.  Yay for him again!

Daddy made it home all right last evening in time to spend some time with the kids before they went to bed.  Everyone was happy to see each other, and good times were had.

Unlike usual trips away from home, none of the lightbulbs around the house blew out while Daddy was away.  Instead, the refrigerator decided that it didn't need to be as cold as usual.  So we are currently waiting for a repairman to come and tell us what is wrong with it.  In the meantime, it seems to be cold enough to keep things from spoiling, though not cold enough to keep anything frozen.  Yummy.  We'll see what happens."

"event","Calvin managed yet another Blue Day today!  I don't know what happened, but for this week at least he seems to have gotten the idea.  Was it an established routine?  Was it picking the right kids to emulate?  Was it him thinking before acting?  No one knows, but we're running with it.  :)  That reminds me, he needs to get 2 or 3 toys back from The Shelf.

Partly in celebration, we got together with a friend and her three kids at the Burger King after school.  See, it's the end of the first 6 weeks of school and the public schools had a half day today.  So Calvin's school got out early too, by an hour.  (In case you're keeping track, he usually gets out at 1:45 on Fridays, so today was 12:45.)  Normal Fridays wreak havoc with Sweetheart's nap, and today was even worse.  Between that and Burger King, I actually just put her to bed early.  And she was ok with it.  It was a long day, especially as I decided to just run errands and stay out all morning as well.  

Everyone loved the chance to run around a bit, and Sweetheart even got inside the playplace a little.  And then crawled out and looked out a window to outside.  Oh, well.  She'll get it.

Later we were having the regularly scheduled Bunny Hunt (where we have to go Find Bunny before putting Sweetheart in her crib) when, after looking in the places she'd been and asking Calvin, I finally asked Sweetheart, ""Do <i>you</i> remember where Bunny is?"".  She pointed toward the living room and said something like ""boo-boo"".  So, I took her and looked again... and sure enough, there was Bunny.  This was good, because I was ready to put Sweetheart to bed and call Burger King to see if Bunny had been left behind and Sweetheart wasn't happy with this idea.  But thanks to me thinking to ask <i>her</i> where she'd left Bunny she went to bed happier-ish.

In interesting news, Kitten ate around 9 and has been asleep ever since.  This is different, because she's been taking a nap at around 7, waking up between 8:30 and 9, and then falling asleep for the night at around 10:30.  I've been wanting the Long Sleep to start a little earlier though, so I'm running with it and seeing what happens to the next few feedings.

In the meantime, I need to sleep already!  *sends self to bed*"

Sweetheart= 21 pounds, 5.5 ounces and Kitten= 12 pounds.  Kitten is 14 weeks old, and Sweetheart is still 19 months- she turns 20 months on the 20th.


Also, Calvin had another day where he stayed on his Blue stick all day.  Two in one week!!  I think we're on to something here!


I can't decide if Sweetheart wears size 18 or 24 month pants.  Tops are definitely 24 months; it seems like she can wear 24mo/2T shorts, but then the pants are a bit bigger in the waist and they sag a bit.  Her length is still more like 12 months, so I know I have to hem whatever she wears- a pity since that means the pants can't have as much cute stuff at the bottom.  :(


I've been thinking about Halloween too... Kitten is going to be a black cat- like <a href= ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cait_Sith"">her namesake,</a>  but the other two I'm not sure about.  Calvin, I think, still wants to be <a href= ""http://disney.go.com/littleeinsteins/swf/main.html"">the Rocket from ""Little Einsteins""</a> despite my gentle suggestions against it.

The card shops have come out with their catalogs of Christmas ornaments, and that reminded me of the toy nativity sets I've seen.  In particular, the <a href= ""http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=900000&e=storeproduct&pid=34128"">Fisher-Price Little People one</a>, that is ok for ages 1+ (meaning it's hard to choke on them).  These are only available online and generally sell out before Thanksgiving, so by the time you think about it you can only get it on eBay for horrifically high prices.  They've added an <a href= ""http://www.fisher-price.com/fp.aspx?st=900000&e=storeproduct&pid=34129"">extra set with extra sheep and shepherds</a> this year as well.

"event","First:  Kitten is 14 weeks old today. :)  Just now I put her on her mat in the living room to give her a bit of ""tummy time"" (since she actually sleeps on her back!) and she held her head up well for a long time.  Then she started to lean, and after spending a couple moments in midair she...  flipped over!!!  And she is now perfectly happy on her back looking around at things, including her fist waving around on its way to her mouth.  She's wiggling a bit too (she's been turning 90 degrees in her bassinet at night) and I think trying to figure out how to get back onto her tummy.  :)    Yay, Kitten!  Soon it will be Cereal Time...

Second:  Calvin achieved a ""Blue Day"" yesterday.  :)  And was still rather good for me for the rest of the day as well.  We have been asking him to help out around the house more, and I think that is helping as well as him learning the ropes at school more.  He's made a couple of friends, and I'm hearing him talk about more kids when he comes home.  His class had a playdate last Thursday where they all went to a nearby playground after school.  The moms got to talk, the kids got to play, and even Sweetheart found a couple of toddler sisters to pretend to talk with.  Their teachers even came, and I had a good conversation with his main teacher about things to do to help him with staying on task (Calvin is an apt name for him after all) and with fine motor skills.  So we've been doing connect-the-dots and peeling shrimp- he likes to help with the cooking.

However, I'm not sure if Calvin will manage a Blue two days in a row.  His usual pattern is to be great for one day, and then rotten the next.  (Usually this happens coming back from vacations or long weekends.)  If he ends up on Blue or Green I will be very happy, but I wouldn't be surprised with a Yellow.

Tonight is Calvin's Open House, and tomorrow is school pictures.  I'm happy to not have to deal with the abomination that is an <u>elementary school yearbook</u>.  They actually have those here, and I think it's just wrong.  However, I did hear one mom say that she got the one for her son's kindergarten year so that she could have pictures of the teachers- but that is a bigger school, with little turnover.  I have no need for one, and I'm glad.

The bad:  Sweetheart is doing fine, don't worry.  In fact, she was just about the only kid not crying when I dropped her off at school this morning.  But I did do some more research into ""gluten sensitivity"".  It turns out that she is in a medical no-man's land, and that there are different opinions about this.  The problem begins with the definition of Celiac Disease/Gluten Intolerance: the problem cannot be called this <u>unless</u> there is significant damage to the intestines.  (Quick run through of this: In these people, glutens cause the immune system to react and destroy cells in the intestine.  These cells, called <i>villi</i>, are the cells that absorb nutrients from food.  Without these cells the body cannot get any nutrients from food, no matter how much of whatever is eaten.)  So, one must be missing villi to get the diagnosis of Gluten Intolerant.  The general medical opinion is that if there is no damage, there is no intolerance, so they call the state where the person has symptoms that are relieved by a gluten-free diet but no damage or antibodies in the blood ""Gluten Sensitive"".  Whether that means the person will ever be able to eat gluten they can't say.  There isn't much research into Gluten Sensitivity, partially because it doesn't have a real definition.  It is possible that Gluten Sensitive people really are Gluten Intolerant and that the condition was caught <u>before</u> the damage was done.  That is the opinion of some people out there.  In fact, there is a private lab out there that will actually test a patient's <i>stool</i> to check for the antibody against gluten (and other things), working under the theory that if the damage is being done in the intestines that the antibodies will show up in the stool <i>before</i> they would show up in the blood.  If you're interested, I'll post the link.  However, that is not the general medical theory- seemingly because they are very caught up in that you can't have an intolerance without damage.  Prevention of that damage is not a priority, it seems.

Except it is for me.

I may call the doctor's in the morning and see if we need to follow up with her ear or maybe even try to see if there was a sinus infection as well that hasn't gone away yet.  If so, I'll get new weights on both Sweetheart and Kitten.

Speaking of Kitten, I'm sure everyone's wondering when I'll get to her.  Well, that's now.  She is doing great.  She is 13 weeks old tomorrow, and still eating, growing, dirtying diapers and sleeping.  She is actually ready for most 3-6 month clothes, reaching that milestone the quickest so far.  In fact, I may put her in size 2 diapers when this last package of size 1 is gone.  She is holding her head up much better, both while being held and on her tummy- though tummy time is still the bane of her existence.  (That and housework, which tends to happen when she wants to sleep or eat.)  In fact, she can kind of sit in your lap, if she's being held.  She's gotten very good at pulling the crib mirror down on herself in the bassinet.  She also gives us 7 good hours of sleep at night, and then a few more after a feeding.  She still eats small frequent meals though during the day.  And she's a little more awake during the day now too.  And Kitten is smiling!!  Mostly in response, but occasionally on her own, and will have 1 or 2 periods per day that we call ""smile practice"" where she spends a couple minutes smiling with whoever is holding her.  We like Smile Practice.

And since Sweetheart just dropped something on the floor and woke Kitten up, I need to go.  More later!"

"event","I think there are some misconceptions out there about Calvin and how his school does discipline.  What's even more confusing is that they do one thing and then say it differently.

What happens is this:  Every student (and this is school wide) starts the day with 4 popsicle sticks.  The sticks are colored: blue, green, yellow, and red (in that order).  They are kept in the classroom, in little pockets (think library books) attached to a poster.  

Since everyone starts with all the sticks, everyone is said to be ""on blue"", meaning they are on their blue stick.  After two verbal warnings, the blue stick is pulled out and the child is said to be ""on green"".  The warnings and stick pulling continue until the red stick is the only one remaining.  Only then is the child removed from the class at all, and I'm not totally clear about what happened then because I only got my information from Calvin.  There is a vice principal at the school in charge of discipline, and I believe Calvin saw him.  But whether that was before or after he spent a few minutes in another class... I don't know.

But the only way for him to be Blue at the end of the day is for his teachers to have to warn him about something fewer than two times.  Over 6 hours.  Calvin.  I'm beginning to be amazed he's had any blue days at all.

Calvin has a folder that comes home with him every day.  This folder holds a page for every week in the grading period, as well as pockets for stuff coming home or being returned to school.  The pages have an area per day that he colors at the end of the day with what color he ended up ""on"". (Or, more accurately, the highest color stick in his pocket.)  A very short summary of what he did to lose his sticks is written around this, so I rarely get more than a few words per offense.  Sometimes I do get longer notes further down on the page, but there's enough space for 1 note, and there are 5 days in the week.  However, I do see his teacher regularly while in the car line, and I can go in and pick him up or schedule a time to meet with her at any time- something I will be doing if these Red days keep up.

I was in the other day and asked his class's aide how he was in comparision to his classmates, and she pointed out that he was still young- that summer birthday kids aren't quite as mature as the others yet.  Since I already knew he was a little immature for his age, I'm not surprised by this.  I'm also heartened that he has improved through most of the day.  He used to have 3 times where he was likely to act up, and 2 of them have been pretty much eliminated by my bringing him early and picking him up as early as possible.  Transitions have always been a problem for him, and bringing him early helps him transition into the day, while picking him up quickly means that he doesn't have a lot of time in limbo between having transitioned out of school but not home yet.

All that's left is transitioning to and from lunch, or more precisely, recess.  Part of this is transition, part is not knowing how to deal with situations that aren't going his way.  The bit with the woodchips was him not knowing how to deal with the fact that some girls wanted to play barbies on top of his ""tent"".  I think some role-playing might be in order, since that isn't the only time something like that has happened.  Calvin also is showing an ability to pick the wrong role model/ kid to want to be friends with, as the times he's hit or kicked he was trying to mimic a game, hoping to be asked to play.

In short, he's learning the ropes of Kindergarten, and having a bit of a time with it."

"event","I'm not wanting to get into Calvin's stuff yet...  I want to have a bit of fun, so I'll talk about Sweetheart.

Sweetheart loves pictures of Dora the Explorer.  It amazes me, but she wanted to nap with a flashcard that happened to have her picture.  She hasn't seen the show much, and it didn't really hold her attention when she did see it, but she loves her some Dora.  She knows characters, and actually has a word for Dora- though it still sounds more like ""backpack"".  In a coincidence worthy of blessing, the only pair of sneakers that fit her right now just happen to be Dora ones, so she loves wearing her Dora shoes.

By the way, she has graduated to size 4 shoes, though she can wear her 3 1/2 white mary janes still.  She's adorable in any shoes, of course.  :)  We have the one pair of sneakers, two dressy pairs of sandals, and black mary janes in 4, but no size 5 (or 6)shoes at all.  Then a bunch of 7's.  *shrugs*  I'd worry, but I don't know how fast her feet will grow anyway.

Sweetheart's favorite thing beside Dora is her Bunny.  I believe Bunny was a present for her first Easter, and other than Sweetheart removing the batting from inside her hat is intact but loved.  Bunny does go places, but we try to leave her in the car (she's great at holding Sweetheart's seat).  However, Bunny has been all over the house, especially with Sweetheart's improving walking skills.  Sweetheart will often take her somewhere and then abandon her for other activities, but Bunny does get fed some, put into Kitten's swing and pushed, or even given drinks from Mama's big cup (we found yet another one and Sweetheart adopted it).  Sweetheart tried to buckle Bunny into her car seat just this morning.  Bunny gets hugged regularly, kissed occasionally, and has even been known to give a kiss or two herself as Sweetheart improves on that kissy noise.  I'm starting to think we should have a backup Bunny around, if we can find one.  In the meantime, Bunny needs a bath.

Sweetheart is also fascinated by buckles- highchairs, swings, bouncy seat, stroller, car seat... she can see how they go together and is now trying to do it herself.  I think she actually got part of the stroller one done this morning.

I am loving putting dresses on her now that she walks.  She's just so cute!!  She is walking better and faster now, and isn't really afraid to walk away from us- so we have to keep an eye on her.  She's also getting more comfortable about going to strange people, though she will cry for a couple minutes now when left in a nursery.  Weird, but true.

At ""school"" they have been talking about Red and One, as well as friends, happy/sad, and, well, school.  After crying at dropoff both days last week and Tuesday this week she didn't cry at all on Thursday.  She clung a bit, but we said goodbye to Kitten and then passed her over to her teacher, and she was fine.  There is a bubble machine set up in a high window, and Sweetheart likes that as well as the play kitchen.  She is very very good at cleaning up, and will put things where they belong with only a couple suggestions.  She's also learning about what goes in the trash can- possibly to our detriment, as we have never have found that missing TV remote.

Also, you may be relieved to hear that Sweetheart has pretty much stopped crying after she is put down to sleep.  She is more likely to play, but she is quiet... unless you have to go back by her room after she was put down.  Then she will cry if she was still awake.  I have also successfully gone into her room to get something for Kitten after putting Sweetheart down and not disturbed Sweetheart overmuch.  Before you couldn't open the door without much crying and begging to get out of the crib, now you can get in, get what you need and get out without any real trouble.  She will wake up, but not cry at you.  I still try to avoid it, but it's nice to be able to do it if I have to.

And that is the state of the Sweetheart."

"event","Hello.  We Are Here.  Here is where I wax on about all the stuff that happens that doesn't make it into the regular phone calls and quick conversations we have with our family and friends.  It's public so no one has to join LiveJournal to see the News, but that also means that anyone and everyone can see it- so I get to make up nicknames for everyone.  Fun for me!

So, mostly this is about the kids: Calvin, Sweetheart, and Kitten.  Enjoy."

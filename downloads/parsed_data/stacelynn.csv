i saw two movies friday night-- hitch--- SO FUNNY, and the ring two-- sooo goood

the ring wasn't really that scary.. like it was jumpy and the music was creepy as necessary for most scary movies, but the scariest thing in the theater i think was shannon. she screamed in the first 2 minutes at a sort of scary part. most people would't have been so startled had shannon not scared everyone with her ""scream and grab."" ha it was a fun night--- and i got flowers! ;)

yup so went to best buy and visited michelle, i looked at the digital cameras b/c i've finally faced the fact that i lost mine and need to buy a new one. while i was  browsing this  family was on the o ther side of the counter looking at other ones and taking pictures of me to 'test"" it out.. woah creepy-- i meann i did look good though hahaaa...

yea  so then i went to coreys for a bon/campfire last night, where i got ashed on by all the pine trees that were being burned. it was really fun, i met some foreigners and hung out with the coolest mount guys ever! and then went to amandas for some strange crazy times

good weekend.. rita's and  work  tonight
any size coffee at wawa for 99c until april 3rd... how hot is  that!?!?!"

+i have my wonderful job back with some of the coolest people that i know
+we got second in our indoor tourn yesterday which i did pretty good and  i didn't get too pissed off we hid kelly's new dora the explorer backpack backpack up in the supports of these tv stands in the complex it was too much fun, me and mo also left some good times pictures on her camera! caught in the act by some wierd lady
+hmm oh backtrack, i had a pretty good friday night even though  i was babysitting, the kids knew all the lines to napoleon dynamite so they got the ok by me! we had a good time and i made $50 in addition to the random $100 that my mom gave me today----- hey  im' not compliaining!
+had so much fun at work AGAIN after john  and my party thursday!!! i almost had to dress up as the ice cream---- escaped that from the skin of my teeth, or maybe just because i'm a ""beautiful should be model who i just want to make smile"" according to some big jolly CREEPY 50 year-old customer who apparenty was unaware that i hadn't showerred in 3 days EYOOO good one
+got to hang out w/ the mount crew last night which was TONS of fun
+caught up w/ people i hadnn't seen for a while mainly Amy cuz i hadn't seen her rin FOREVER same w/ louis and brendan who i hadnt seen sinnce like last spring break.. and brenndan told me about this band bright eyes... i dont know they aren'nt bad i went to their website! yeah i met some new people, hung w/ jaxters and brad which is always a good time annnd how could i  forget my talk w/ viv, she's the coolest and we cleared up a little misunderstanding so now we're pretty much best friends! yeayaaaaaaaaaaa good weekend at the endn of a verry VERy stressful week

-->aka post office story which i'll probably be mentioning when i'm in a not so good mood... that time MIGHT be tomorrow on valentines day--- but then again it might not, i'm in a pretty good place right now where i dont really care if i get/have a boyfriend. i mean i'm sure it would be nice for once buuuuuuut if i had a boyfriend it would be a little differentn for me to have my  ""i do what i want"" persona... kna mean? so we'll see i'm pretty well occupied right now as far as boys are concerned so we'll see what happens. 

i gotta watch shark tale.. i keep falling asleep
and write my effing short story--- i'll make it good... maybe if its really good you guys'll see it sometime! eyoooooooooooo (but thats very unlikely- i believe myself to me a pretty shitty writer)"

it was a much needed fun weekend minus saturday day when we didn't  make nationals--- yea i pretty much felt like a clown in more than one instance so we're not gonna go into all of that, i'd rather have a positive outlook on this weekend than think about how we aren't going to VA beach unless we win the 'NIT lotter' or whatever. good one

i slept through dinner, despite my family's attempt to wake me up, which i apparently yelled at them a lot. i must have been in a hell of  a deep  sleep-- which is likely b/c i remember mostly my whole dream, i was in a world that somewhat resembles senior week, only all of our friends were staying in this huge house/hotel type thing that was like a world in its own. there were fountains and  couches and rooms and nature inside and stuff. very very cool... but i can't tell whether it was a good or bad dream, i never can w/ certain stuff.

anyways, i hope i dont keep up this sleep stuff, not that i dont mind the sleeping.. its only the 6:30 wakeup EVERY MORNING that i mind.

i have so much  to write about... but i just dont feel like it, and i should be getting to my hw.. since i've only JUST hit the halfway mark of my challenges for physics--- good one.

<P>New Years was awesome! The night started out a little crazy-hectic, but it ended better than i ever could have anticipated. We went to Amanda's first... that didn't really work out, unfortunately. So we headed over to zach's apartment and caught up w/ micah and lee--- who managed to get me in the shins a couple more times. Anyways... so we didn't stay there long because we realized how much we'd rather be hanging out with lee goldberg and some of the rest of&nbsp;last years seniors!! duh... THAT'S A NO BRAINER! So we ended up at lee's for the night which was amazing. the ball dropping kinda snuck up on me, but we saw it and counted down and all that good stuff.. i managed to lose my cell phone CONVENIENTLY just as some&nbsp;people started calling me to wish me a happy new year. convenient in a sarcastic way...... well not in all cases. EYOOOOO anyways, didn't get much&nbsp;sleep---i missed my window which sucked assssssss, but i could always&nbsp;blame it on the&nbsp;few SNORERS in the room... mmmmmhmmmm you&nbsp;heard me. but&nbsp;yea it was an&nbsp;awesome night&nbsp;we listened to cool music, got to go crazy with a bunch of crazy people&nbsp;for a couple hours,&nbsp;had a lot of laughs... caught up w/ the UD guys again... it was&nbsp;a much needed night w/ the oldies!</P>
<P>my wonderful wakeup WHAT? oh yea it was around <STRONG>FOUR O'CLOCK AM!!!!!!!!! </STRONG>yea... that was KINDOF TOTALLY NOT FUNNY. i basically woke up&nbsp;twice this morning, neither time being very pleasant, 4am... how cann that be pleasant.. and then againn at 7:30 after the car ride was pretty painful... a two hour tease is what it was-- bad one. oh well i got to be in virginia-- which for some reason just made me happy.. maybe because i love virginia.. i WANT to live there.. but i probably won't seejing as i strangely didn'nt apply to ANY colleges there.. hmmmmm. anyways it was a pretty good tourn. we missed mo and ellen a lot CLEARLY b/c we were 2-3. but yea i didn't do too bad..and i got some reading in. It was a good day-- hopefully a good night ahead.</P>
<P>good one</P>"

"event","so this break has been pretty productive. Even though i haven't really gone out that much, or done that much i've been having a lot of fun. its been a relaxing break... and i've been on top of my hw-- i know i'm a loser. but on monday night.... mm nevermind i'll probably still be working on the shitload of stuff that i have to do. ANYWAYS...

yesterday ross taught me how to play texas holdem... not that tough. especially for a card shark like myself who cleaned house-- haha just kidding. but yea that was fun, and i went to michellios w/ the girls which was SOOO nice. probably my favorite night this week, with  the group together just hanging out talking in  the prettiest christmassy decorated house i've seen!

oh yea AND i got to see some of the old seniors... lee, ben, rob, matty--  good times. lee goldberg is possibly the coolest kid i've ever and will ever meet. i love that guy-- we made ice cream sundaes for rob and maureen who's  b-days are TODAY.. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, mo is REALLY a big girl now! too bad she's not here to celebrate with.. but i'm sure she's having fun up in ski-town. ah well its been a decent break so far.. and its nearing its end i feel already-- but hopefully new years will be fun?? i do not know..

dodgeball tomorrow!! hellllllllllllssssss yea"

"event","at amanda's right now bout to get my hair did. it SHOULD look pretty tight, if amanda is as capable as before! but anyways, merry christmas, it was a good one, better than most.

i saw the darkness at night w/ amanda and her sister--- BAD movie, i mean it scared me a little but it was still bad, just because its scary doesn't make it well written... and it sure wasn't, i dont recommend it.

anyways so sunday was fine too.. i didn't really do much AT ALL.. i bought a new pair of shoes, and watched some of van helsing before i went to my aunts house. ross picked came for an hour to inhale some fooooooood and then saved me SORT OF!! to go hang out w/ lee and marc... good one

tonight should be fun, i worked out--- feel good-- and my hairs about to look damn sexy"

thanks ross for ANY kinds of pep talks

i KNOW that my lj picture is hot, you dont have to tell me twice!! i was thinking about getting green contacts, since they look so good... yea?

anyways, i wrapped up my c-mas shopping today-- last minute naturally, and visited michelle at work while i  got my dad some a dvds. shopping alone is so relaxing SO RELAXING. The perfect thing to do when you need alone time..  instead of just sitting. so yea i'm taking a break from wrapping presents because i HATE wrapping presents!!! ohhh my gosh i  hate it.. maybe  it has something to with the  fact that i suck at it, i dont know. Regardless, i have to wrap these presents anyway.

napoleon dynamite tonight with the  fam!! it should be extra special.. my dad got it for me, he told me.. the day he bought it. my dad's crazy-- i hope he likes napoleon, all i know is that i have to introduce napoleon and my family before tomorrow, when the people that'll think he's stupid are here!!"

"event","<P>So much for a hair cut--- it pretty much looks EXACTLY the same as it did earlier today but it feels better, and probably looks nicer overall, so it wasn'nt a complete waste. this just means i'll have to treat myself in a couple weeks to a nice INTENSE haircut!</P>
<P>i'm beat as hell and i have a WHOLE english paper..i NEED some caffeine, but wawa is just such a journey..&nbsp;its a damn good thing napoleon comes out tomorrow or else i'd have almost nothing to live for!! christmas is almost here, so close yet so far away too bad my cousins aren't coming for christmas, looks like it will be yet another boring holiday get together, not that i dont enjoy my family's company... i do sort of, its just not the best of times, i'll probably be taking full advantage of the new addition to the family (digital cable), california video, hopefully a few dvd gifts, and maybe some new toys!!! *if my family knows whats good for 'em. I'll leave the jewelry gift giving up to my boyfriend.... OH WAIT</P>
<P>all i'm sayin is as soon as break hits, i'm gonna party like its my goddamn birthday--- we need to get this situation under control!</P>"

"event","<P>ok eating today = bad</P>
<P>i ate a hell of enough yesterday of becky's fabulous foods, so eating anything today was a bad idea. i think i've gotten over the sickness of the daytime and now i'm more awake than ever. i was seriously falling asleep at amanda's house today after i got TWELVE hours of sleep last night. i can't even remember the last time i got 12 hours of sleep. I would have gotten way more than 12 if my dad hadn't woke me up. Whats up with that honestly-- he walks in calls my name out JUST loud ennough for me to hear, and then notifies me of the time. THANK YOU CAPTAIN</P>
<P>I </P>
<P>DO </P>
<P>NOT </P>
<P>CARE!!!! </P>
<P>teenagers need sleep daddyo, but it looks like i wont be getting any more today. </P>
<P>not to mention i woke to the wonderful newspaper--- full of all state pictures. enough said there. </P>
<P>so bourne supremacy was disappointing, not even half as exciting as the first bourne, if it hadn't been for matt daamon the movie would have been a complete waste of time. so the music video channel rocks-- i always find myself watching it whenever i finally decide to start my homework, its ironic, it really is. </P>
<P>Anyways, i love mae and ""the love of my life brad allmond who i miss and had the best 5 years of my life with""</P>"

babysitting was pretty great, it was just what i needed this afternoon to get away. something corporate eased my mood on the drive up, arts and crafts with the girls was relaxing during, and naturally something corporate and a cute guy driving next to me on the way home.

i guess it was good to witness something i'm decent at to make me feel better.

i should be more successful. i've had a false sense of success this whole time, i better start working harder and being more outgoing?? i'll have to think about that one a little more.

i watched this wiiieeerd documentary on this serial killer aileen character-- it was HILARIOUS. she was totally insane with some of the things she said i laughed out loud, which was sort of ashame. but i also watched a documentary on drunk driving damages in teenagers. very sad-- DONT do it. 

did challenges for like the first time ever.. but i still have some reading i need to do, goodnight.

anywho, it was another interesting night to  say the least... its a crazy life i'll tell you what, so i lost myself in the amazing game i like to call ""the lyric game"". good call good call
i had a nice little two liner about my old manager which was pretty funny.

oh and i realized that i COULD BE TAKING THE SAT IIs tomorro EXCEPT GUIDANCE DOESN'T KNOW JACK ABOUT SATs. i read today you can be a standby and walk in and take them if they have space for you at the testing spot... however you have to have a registration page completed  in the specific envelope.. too bad i didn't know this information until TONIGHT so it was a merely 5 hours too late to get a registration from school. lucky me. basically SAT IIs are out of the picture for good old stace....

school was ok, nothing special, but pretty fun... my house was actually fun tonight, but only because i was going crazy, otherwise it would have been silent and dead. i do not know. i showed danny the picture of his twin.. AHAHA that was fabulous, i swear that kid is his twin, oh man.
decent day, tired and lazy annnnnnnnnd indescribable i guess

oh yea i'm playing dodgeball w/ the mount guys.. that should be hella fun, i'm saying we should be called ""whats up now"" seriously, that would be hot to put on our shirts.. or maybe that could be our slogan not team name. good one,, TEAR EM UP! i'm excited about that and the keane concert, and visiting our sr. week house  after the championship football game on sunday!!

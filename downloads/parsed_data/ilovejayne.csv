Hey, tanks a lot!

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian tank crashed through a villager's house after the crew stopped to buy more vodka at a nearby shop.

Footage from a mobile phone camera showed the tank hitting a corner of the house and a laughing, and apparently drunk, driver awkwardly trying to clamber aboard with two bottles of vodka.

""Get him out of the tank,"" screamed a woman in the village in the Urals.

The army promised Friday to pay compensation and said the tank must have been broken and fallen behind a column heading to a test site for exercises. Earlier it said the vehicle slid on melting ice.

""Of course, there were violations but the crew acted in good faith to catch up with its unit,"" said Colonel Konstantin Lazutkin, spokesman for Russia's Volga-Urals Military District.

""Thank God, they didn't shoot,"" the house owner said on the video.

I'm nearly caught up on all my email and crap.  Life has improved despite me being cut off from all you wonderful shiny people.  A couple of thoughts:

1)  EEEEEE!!!  Chuck!!!  I absolutely *adore* this show.  Even the non-Adamy parts.  Maybe even (gasp) <i>especially</i> the non-Adamy parts.  WD was every bit as painful as Buy-More, and then some.  (Pineapple!)

2)  Is it Labor Day weekend 2008 yet?  Maybe 'cause it's the last time I got to talk with Browncoats for a long time, but I'm still not done rehashing this year's D*C in my head.  Or maybe it's 'cause I'm one of those people for whom half the fun of something is in the planning.

3)  I'm supposed to direct the Christmas program at church this year.  ME?!?!?!?  It might be doable if I had been the one to put it together, but Mom organized it.  And I can't read her mind, and she keeps telling me how to do it, and it doesn't make sense to me, and...  asack.

4)  There's a huge parcel of timberland by my house that has been rezoned  and divided, so now we have a bunch of new neighbors.  We met one woman (and her dog) and she seems nice, but I'm not sure which of the others bothers me more--the people who hauled in a little camper for a hunting camp and haven't bothered to clean the grounds, or the people who cleared out a huge driveway and put up a fancy gate and appear to be planning a very large house with a very large yard.  (Another drought like this year's, and water usage becoames a huge issue.)"

Yeah, I'm just learning to play with it.  Need to know what I'm doing by D*C.

In other news, my sunmmer's been going fairly well.  Not great; being unemployed sucks, and I need to make more productive use of my time, but I saved a good bit before I quit (mainly because I never had time off to spend it), so I'm in okay financial straits.  I thought I'd take the free time and try to lose weight, but first it was was killer hot (90s in apr. and early may, 100s from may into june), then it started raining every afternoon.  So of course I gained a lot.  I feel horrible, and I'm trying to exercise more.

Mom had a class to take in Tallahassee last month, and I got to go with her. Didn't get to meet up with Cavie, unfortunately, but we got to visit lots of parks and stuff on the way back.  It was nice.

I've been to the beach a couple of times, got a few sunburns.

Was in charge of snacks at VBS this year.  Fixed A LOT of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

i think that's about it.

I've been trying to get more exercise, but I can't drag myself out of bed early enough in the morning to go outside while it's still relatively cool.

In short, I'm pretty dissatisfied with myself right now.  Which means I'm cranky and avoidant right now.  Maybe I should go find a good argument to get involved in. :P"

At any rate, I'm functioning.  Had a pretty good day Saturday, went to the beach.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop that because my skin is starting to show signs of sun damage, and I don't want to end up with a leathery face before I'm fifty, if I can help it.

I seriously need exercise, but I'm always aching all over.

I think it's time for a change.  What kind, I don't know, but it's obvious that I'm dissatisfied with the way things are right now.  There's only so much I can do to change my situation, so maybe I should work on changing myself."

Feeling better today.

It's been a warm day, overcast/hazy/smokey.  I had thought about going to the river but it's too blah for that.  May still go for a walk to take advantage or the less-than-95 weather, though.

We managed to find homes for two kittens, but a cat I never knew was ever pregnant just brought her four up to the house.  *headdesk*  At least they're pretty.  One of them had the gray points like a siamese, but also has orange spots all over.  Never seen one like that before."

Monday I filled out my application, went to the beach, and then went shopping.  Managed not to get too sunburned, but didn't find anything I wanted to buy.

Tuesday I picked the squash and made a blackberry cobbler.

Wednesday was not as good because I was horribly sick.  Sore throat, aching all over.  And today I woke up with chest congestion. Seriously, I was rattling and wheezing, but I knew it was just sinus drainage, so I spent nearly three hours doing nothing but watching DVDs and breathing deeply.  But at least I'm not hurting all over anymore.  Lungs still feel kinda funny, but I'm staying inside away from pollen.

I need new icons.  I lost them all when my old hard drive crashed, and most of those I had saved on photobucket look awful with this higher resolution.  Maybe I'll work on that later."

The parts are only available at the dealership, which means it's going to be expensive.  But still, likely cheaper than buying a new car.  And a whole lot easier.

Job coming open tomorrow.  I have a good shot at this one.  *fingers crossed*  I'm also hoping to do the shopping thing tomorrow.  And the beach.  Forecast is absolutely gorgeous!  And sunshine is good for my mood.

Also, please send prayers and mojo to everyone in Waycross.  One of the men in my church is a forestry firefighter and has been there since shortly after it started.  His three kids are missing their daddy something fierce.  And we just found out that some of the neighbors have family there that lost their homes.  Fortunately, it's just property so far; here's hoping it stays that way.

We've finally tracked down all of this year's kittens.  I wish I had a working camera.  Along with the usual black/black & white, we've got two calico(e?)s and two siamese.  So cute!"

The good stuff happening in my life, since I haven't focused on it much lately:

1) Summertime!  Well, the weather is not yet fully cooperating, but all the other signs are there.  The persimmon trees have budded out, and they are the last to do so.  They usually don't until May.  The pecan trees are blooming, and that isn't supposed to happen until June!  There's a whippoorwill just down the hill singing every night, and nighthawks and bats chasing bugs in the evenings.  The dewberries are getting ripe!  I had a whole handful today.

2) Tuesday night Mom and I went to watch one of the girls from church play ball in the 6-8 year-old league.  So cute!  It was machine-pitch, but she was the pitcher for fielding purposes. The girls played their hearts out, and I didn't hear any nasty youth-league parents there.  It was hard not to root for both teams.  The littlest girl on either team hit a home run, and boy, if I could have sold her for what she felt like she was worth! :D

3) We had a pair of tiny kittens show up on the breezeway, and no idea which cat they belonged to.  Fortunately, they've been adopted--by a cat who for years I thought was sterile, then gave birth to a litter too deformed to live.  She's incredibly stupid in many ways, but is a good, caring, protective momma cat.  Aw. :)"

Dragon*con.  Yeah, wasn't that fun?  Real update later this week.

I so needed that vacation, 'cause RL just got pretty sucky.  Not ony did work go nuts while I was gone, but B. is probably going to leave, too.  More on that later, as well.

I promise to focus on the upside, though."

I had posted a list on our little messageboard at work:

<i>I want:
- a million dollars
- a new car, preferably a convertible
- my own private island
- a pony</i>

What they gave me was:
- a little Hot Wheels convertible
- a puzzle that was a picture of an island
- a My Little Pony
- ten dollars  (They couldn't find any play money.)

Hee!  So cute.

My parents gave me a new tv (mine had gotten hit by lightning).

I did get my vacation approved, so I'm all set for Dragon*Con!  I'll probably start packing on my next day off. ;)"

We shut the store down at ten instead of midnight, this time with approval from the big boss, and those of us who were still there went up on the roof to celebrate with fireworks and booze.  I had the good sense to avoid the alcohol until about 11:30... only had a third of a bottle of Smirnoff and evreyhting's all bendy.  It was fun, though, at least as much funa s you can really have hanging with upper management, y'know?  The entrance to teh roof is through teh machine room and up a ladder to the hatch on the roof--feels like somtehing out of the movies.  I caught myself humming the James Bond theme a couple of times.

And yes, I know this post is riddles with spelling errors, but you know what?  I don't care!  Whheeeeeeee!

Oh, and the cops had some kind of a bust at teh BP across the street, had three patro;l cars over there.  And then they came over and ran off the teenagers that were loitering in our parking lot.

So ILJ = tipsy.  And debating whether to finish that bottle or leave it for tomoorrw."

-a marriage proposal from my manager (kidding [I think])

<TR>
<TD>You are the Spiteful Loner, the personality type that is most likely to go on a shooting rampage. You are a rational person and tend to hold emotions in very low-esteem; not only that, but you are also rather introverted, meaning you probably bury any emotions you feel deep inside yourself. Combine these traits with your hatred of others and your brutality, and it seems that you would be quite likely to shoot innocent people in a rampage. Not only that, but you are also a very humble person--not a braggart at all--meaning you could possibly have low-self esteem. This is only yet one more incentive to go on a shooting rampage, because you wouldn't care if you died as a result. Granted, you probably haven't gone on a shooting rampage and probably never will, but all the motivations are there. In conclusion, your personality is defective because you are too introverted, brutal, insecure, and rather unemotional. No wonder no one hangs around you, you morbid, cold-hearted freak! 
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more RATIONAL than intuitive. 
<P>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 
<P>3. You are more BRUTAL than gentle. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I> 
<P>
<P><B>Compatibility:</B>

<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=100&score3=0"">Capitalist Pig</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=100&score3=100"">Smartass</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=0&score2=100&score3=100"">Sociopath</A>. 
<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

Introspective and reflective, you think about everything and anything.
You are a soft-hearted daydreamer. You long for your ideal life.
You love silence and solitude. Everyday life is usually too chaotic for you.

Given enough time alone, it's easy for you to find inner peace.
You tend to be spiritual, having found your own meaning of life.
Wise and patient, you can help people through difficult times.

At your worst, you brood and sulk. Your negative thoughts can trap you.
You are reserved and withdrawn. This makes it hard to connect to others.

Thank you SO much for ruining my night.  It wasn't enough for me to have to deal with a whiny cashier going home early and being by myself in the office; no, you all had to come in and make it worse. Thank you EVER so much.

To the lady who wrote a bad check *KNOWING* it was going to show up in the system and I couldn't accepting: I hope to God you enjoyed your damn magazine after you put back the other ten items you couldn't pay for with cash.

To the people standing in line wating while she did all this:  I'm sorry you had to wait.  Or I was, until I put my ALREADY COUNTED AND RECONCILED till back down there to help you out, and you decided to chew me out. Over having to wait while I opened my rolls of change, Over paying more than you thought you should because you didn't read the gorramn sign right there in front of the milk--I should have made you come back in the morning when the service desk was open, but since you told me to put it back FIVE FRICKING TIMES, I wasn't in the mood to argue with you.

To the lady who was upset over a five dollar roast and nine dollar crab legs: have you not shopped since the stone age?  Those were good prices-- and they were printed right there on the products, so you should have seen them BEFORE you had me scan them.  Dumbass.

To the lady who got a whole buggy piled full and came up to the register at five minutes til closing: I hate you.  Shop at a reasonable hour.

Same to the guy who didn't make it to the register until five after. I already told you we didn't have the ice cream you wanted.  Sorry.  Standing there staring into the freezer isn't going to make it appear, I promise.

To the safe, which kept coming up short:  Sure, you're an inanimate object, or so you say, but that doesn't mean I can't be mad at you.  You're lucky I don't try to push you out the window, buddy.

To management:  You have NO idea how lucky you are I waited to dump all this on LJ instead of on the idiots themselves."

Sort of.  I'll probably be in the office two or three days a week and on a register the rest of the time, but still, it'll help.  It'll mean a move to the night shift, which means I get to go back to sleeping late. Which I think is even better than the pay.  Or maybe not.

Today was a whole lot quieter than I figured it would be.  We managed to get the whole place shut down and get out by five after closing time.  Niiice!

Every day this week, people have brought piles of food for lunch for everyody.  I've gained ten pounds since Thanksgiving.  ugh.  Gonna have to do that New Year's diet thing, I guess.  Assuming they stop with the food."

"event","The last two days have been almost as busy as the weekend before Thanksgiving.  I like being productive (twice as much in sales as normal!) but good grief.

What gives?  It's not the first of the month, it's too early for Christmas groceries, and the kids aren't out of school until <i>next</i> week, so it isn't that either.

Huh.

I feel kinda like I've been run over by a truck.  Good thing I'm off tomorrow!"

"event","Sleepy.  Something keeps waking me up too early in the morning, and although I'm getting my full eight hours of sleep, it's broken into a five hour stretch and a three hour one.  Not tired though.

At work last Friday I had a woman come through my line and got PO'ed at me when I wouldn't cash a check for her without ID.  Smart move; the bank called today to report that check stolen.  Yay, me.  On the other hand, I had a minor temper tantrum when my boss pulled me off a perfectly good register and made me test the crappy one to see if it had worked, thus irritating me AND my customers.  They could have tested it while it was in training mode.  Dumbasses.  Then they put the other cashier over there for a bit, and made her suffer with it.  As far as I know, it was still broken when they repair guy left.  Fucking idiots.  GRRRR...  And it turns out I'm highly allergic to the dust and mold and crap that's stirred up by the heating system, too, so I had the red-faced, sneezing, watery-eye thing going on today.  Mucho fun.

Everything is good in other news, though.  I've been feeling highly creative lately and have tons of energy.  Which of course goes to waste when my eyes won't stay open, but I do seem to be getting more done in my off-time.  More exercise, more writing, more painting.

Friday is Browncoat Day-- the anniversary of the Variety ad in '02, and the FF DVD release in '03.  I plan to turn it into Take Your Action Figure To Work Day. ;)  I keep thinking surely I can make a few converts there eventually."

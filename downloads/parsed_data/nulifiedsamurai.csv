"event","I read an interesting article today regarding that which defines every human being. The article was pretty gritty, and lacked much sensitivity. This is something I can appreciate.

The article basically stated in a nutshell that we are measured by our usefulness to other human beings. Our skills that we provide others. The things that define us, are really that which we provide to others, not to ourselves. If there were no other humans to find what it is you do useful in any way, or to remark on that which you do, it wouldn't mean a whole lot other than potentially your own survival.

The last few days I've been down in the dumps. I wonder if it's actually been the last few days....

Heather says I'm just being too hard on myself. I can understand that the reality is she is trying to make me feel better because she loves me. She only wants the best for me, but has a way of sugar coating the truth sometimes I feel. I wonder if that has rubbed off on me a bit too. I can't fight for very long these days when big issues arise. I just don't have it in me. Acceptance. Conformity.

My health and weight I have realized after years and years (well documented through my journal) of struggling to maintain a consistent healthy figure, directly effect absolutely every. Single. Aspect. Of my life. I mean everything. Most importantly, my confidence and faith in myself seem to be directly governed by my overall health.

The crazy thing is, I used to starve myself when things got a little out of hand. I was a freak about it at one point in time in my very young adult life. I may have mentioned this at some point in the years of sporadic entries, but once I finally lost all that weight in high-school, I watched as the world around me completely shifted it's angle towards me. Since then, I believe this has been embedded into my brain. Life is just...better when you feel good and look good. You take care of you, and the rest takes care of itself. Something Tony Horton basically touches on in one of those workouts. The body will take care of you if you take care of it. He doesn't touch base on how good everything else gets either. It's pretty...spectacular. Hard work will always bear fruit.

"event","Good evening, sporatic documentation that is my adult life.

I feel like garbage tonight despite the workout. Yesterday I ate so much crap it's a wonder I'm not sick as a dog. Unfortunately I was not born with much of a gag reflex. I can count on two hands in 27 years how many times I've thrown up. Half of those were probably alcohol induced.

Speaking of, I am in the process (again) of toning the drinking and pot smoking down. By that I mean quitting once again. I always end up quitting because my body and mind tell me it's the right thing to do. Sobriety infused with good health and fitness far surpasses any good time I could possible have partying. I do enjoy marijuana tremendously. It humbles me a great deal and provides an alternative perspective on many thoughts. Like so many other things in life, when abused it's no good for you. Start tacking on other luxuries in excess and you've certainly got a recipe that doesn't taste well.

I want this to be the last time. I've been in a perpetual cycle for about 7 years now. Constantly making rapid changes to my lifestyle. One minute I'm a fitness junkie that exposes an outgoing, fun and productive personality and the next minute I'm a lazy video-game nerd, absorbing handfuls of local fast food in my own private quarters greasing up my Xbox controllers.

That sounds disgusting but it's a sad truth.

I'm wasting time. Wasting the fuck out of my time. I'm not getting any younger, and my skills aren't getting much sharper. I was blessed with a lot of different talents I only exploit in small doses. It's beginning to depress me actually, which is not like me. I have noticed in the time periods I discipline my life completely, I am extremely productive and helpful to those around me. I am all around a better person, with the confidence to do anything!

As usual, I am able to make these observations as I have done so many times in the past, but what is it going to take to implement it into my EVERYDAY life? I know this world is shit, but I still want to live a long and healthy life. I want to make an impact in this world. If the guy writing on this page 7 years ago could see this post today, he would be incredibly disappointed.

Yeah I've got a really great steady job. I make good money and I've got a lot to call my own but fuck it feels so empty. It's literally a BATTLE everyday to not get lost in the day to day routine. It's a BATTLE for me to fight the thought of being there the rest of my life because it's the EASY thing to do. I'm such a fucking sucker for the EASY route. Though I finally did something recently that may forever change the course of this cycle.

I tried to get Heather pregnant. Well <i>we</i> tried. It's only a week out but it's the first time I've ever tried to have a child with anyone. Ever since Tara had a miscarriage it's been one of my biggest fears. I remember thinking my entire life crashed down on me and everything I knew was going to change. Ironic....because that's kind of what I want to happen to me right now. After learning of my sister Kayla's pregnancy on Christmas day I realized I DO have the capacity to be a father. A good one at that. I feel like maybe this is what I need to make a permanent change in who I am. 

I am not banking on this. I gave it a try and if it was meant to be then so be it. The current of this river that is my instincts, guiding my every move, has since come to a slow and steady trickle.

I know I'm at the point where hard work and dedication will be my only saving grace. I am living far too comfortable a life right now.

Choose Bernard. Two major paths lay in front of you. Your time is running the fuck out."

"event","As a child and teen I was an avid writer in the poetic sense. In my adulthood I believe I have created four works of art through classic poetic writings, all of which were fueled by the notion of loving emotions. Which kind of makes sense, as that's ALL I used to think about growing up.

I don't even know how to explain recent circumstances, but my soul has been touched by a being I had much disdain for initially. I've tried to rationalize this event by blaming these deep feelings on sexual ecstacy. I have come to realize however, the degree of sexual ecstacy I (we) are experiencing can not possibly exist without further interpretation.

I always feel a lack of masculinity when I say this, but to me sex is the ultimate expression of love. While I know this to be true, it certaintly does not mean it always works that way and I am no exception. In fact, I've spent the better part of the last 8-9 years seeking a purely physical sexual lifestyle with women (which I do believe had a lot to do with my own barriers). When you experience the bonding of another soul at a young human age, I don't think you are yet equipped to handle the appreciation for those events responsibly. I believe this to be the reason my barriers fortified in such an intense manner when that bond was severely severed against my will.

Here I am though, almost a decade later without even knowing it was still possible, appreciating this extraordinary experience. I, the bachelor who notoriously preaches the solo journey into adultery and promiscuity, have found myself blind-sided by a soul that has completely laughed at my barriers and warmed my soul with a flame ignition that fickled years ago. I am in awe.

Rightfully, I am now plagued with questions as I have discovered this dormant area of my being once more. My soul has grown substancially in this body in the matters of my life's lessons as I watched intensely behind those barriers. This makes the situation much more intriguing, and different than I remember from the past. I have taken the approach without even thinking too deeply, to simply appreciate these bonding experiences.

I recall becoming lost in a whirlwind of emotions before. My soul ached to swallow the soul of my bonding mate as the experience became so addictive physically and spiritually. I could not appreciate the lessons of bonding at that time, which is something I feel many humans actually rarely do appreciate!

We are here to help one another through life. We produce energies that can assist or derail other beings with our actions. 

This ascension into the bonding of another soul is actually HEALING me as a person I'm realizing. I have become so much less cynical, more appreciative, helpful, & happy simply because of the positive energies given to me by another being. I feel cleansed, and completely exhilerated. I spent a good four to five years verbally stating to people that I genuinely have NO soul whatsoever. My soul felt lost & caged, but I was completely ok with that because at least then the energies of other beings could not harm it. Nothing good, nothing bad entered my internal being. My internal self had become a military camp protecting the most precious of it's cargo through vicious warfare that consisted of not caring about anything, and completely rejecting what other humans had to offer me through any sort of bonding or internal communication.

I am free. I feel free, finally.

This brings me back to the simple act of appreciation. I was so destroyed in the past because I abused and took for granted this bonding experience. Having spent almost a decade numb to the world, as I step out and take my first real breaths from my deepest recesses internally, I can guarentee that I will not make that same mistake again. Maybe there was a reason I spent all that time caged. Maybe it was just my way of dealing with it. Maybe both. Either way, I have emerged wiser, and more fulfilled than ever before.

I extend my eternal gratitude to this soul that despite my INCREDIBLE resistance and rejection, has taught me the true value of love (a couple months ago that word LITERALLY would have made me cringe and gag).

So what did poetry have to do with any of this? As I stated in the first paragraph, the fuel of all those writings were based off an emotion I have rejected for years. I have embraced this emotion, and found it's rightful spot on my internal mantle. For the first time in ages, I feel the need to verse off the top of my head and attempt to create poetic rhythem via text once more.

I don't know what the lyrics are going to consist of yet, but let's call this one:
Reunite (I looked up at my subject line and it felt appropriate)

Lost and hidden the soul divides
A rejection of it's host
A life without, the body hides
The thing that matters most

This is to me, the mystery
How can it not be one?
It is to be, not mine to see
I can't control what's done

So we arrive, the great divide
connects and we are ""whole""
Now we contrive and live our lives
adjusting the body and soul

The purpose of which, a constant itch
and answers will never be clear
events are pitched, from ditch to ditch
we rise and fall and fear

Often we choose which side to abuse
the internal or external lust
to light the fuse can be much to lose
you can sever one to dust

Balance is key, when you strive to be
the commander of your fate
Only now do I see, when I used to flee
patience is worth the wait

There is a rhythm to life dont you know
we are pushed in currents and waves
To push and pull aginst the flow
will likely cause you pain

Watch and wait as an open mind
the answers come in time
Just don't seclude that which defines
the bond of human kind

Better than one we are not
the eternal education we face
To humble and hear what we are taught
will only advance our race

I realize now, the reason I write
I have accepted the power of love
It will bond us all and reunite
We can ascend and rise above

Shed these anchors, remove your pride
accept that we're all the SAME!
Be honest inside, we have nothing to hide
and laugh when you have thoughts of shame

There is a final verse I cannot disburse
My final lesson is at hand
Take heed of yourself and lift that curse
the separates your fellow man."

Sweat still beading lightly, cool night air flowing through the cracked patio door tingling my persperated skin. I breathe in what always feels like the freshest air in these moments. My mind and body thanking me.

November 5th will have even more memorial for me personally. I'm closer than ever, though ignoring the anxious mindset. It's not just about completing this and proving to myself I still have what it takes to commit to something, it's the beginning of the end of my current path. 

Over the weekend I indulged my Saturday evening and completely baked myself out. I catch myself getting lost in my thoughts whenever I smoke. The physical reality seems so....far away.

I considered my death. I took an enormous step outside myself and realized that if there was ever a moment I could die content...this would be the time. My potential accomplishments gone, but content in everything around me.

I get so self-depricating thinking these things. Always feel like I am undeserving. I am very happy with who I am, and believe I am a good person...but never deserving.
Did catholicism really do that much damage as a child or is there something more?

Thanksgiving vacation home around the corner. Nine chaotic days of seeing those I cherish, those who played some role in who I am today.

I am going to be SUCH a friggin lightweight. This is the least I've drank since I turned 21 I think. It's all good though, it makes the reward of getting to indulge that much more intensified.

To appreciate a moment....to repeat a moment.....take your pick."

"event","I sit here momentarily, eyes closed, attempting to muster the deepest recess of my soul. That I may somehow put everything into a written text. 

Trying to put the idea of what can only be described as feeling within ourselves into written language, can for some such as myself, be one of the more daunting challenges in life.

For whatever reason, this is something I've always needed to stay connected internally. Writing has this power to almost make it seem as though the words in front of you are not yours to claim. There is this truth that cannot be expressed so directly in any other form. That being said, let us have a moment together old friend.

I don't even know where to begin. What is the area I want to express here? Do I want to reflect on the past events, analyzing where I was and concluding my current state?

You have dwelled on the past long enough.

How could I not though, I'm fascinated constantly of what life is capable of. I can't get enough of it. So many limitless possibilities, yet so structured. Somehow I know that the wall I'm always breaking down is supposed to be there. I needed to be separated. I needed to learn.

Where things will go on the other side is the mystery of all mysteries at this very moment. To learn that weaknesses within yourself can be your greatest strength makes determining what you previously thought was right confusing. I won't lie, I'm disoriented.

As a matter of course I am just following what something in the back of my mind is telling me to, and it's the only path I have right now. While that may seem frustrating having no other options, this path is the most peaceful place I've been to yet. I only have the other beings in my life that care enough to have led me here to thank.

A bow to you all for my eternal gratitude. I only wish I had more to give.

In a more classic journal formula, I am completely back to my nerd roots. Having not a single friend I can count on, I've created the perfect nerd cave/bachelor pad. It's been up for over a week now and I have already found myself wanting more socially in my life.

It completely astounds me how these people are down here. The three I have bent a knee in honor for, have all betrayed me in the most selfish of fashions.
I simply can not put my energy into such fruitless relationships any longer.

I am not inclined to hate, we are all souls of different maturities looking to progress in our own way. Provided these people learn SOMETHING in a life that can enhance the soul in some way, it was a life worth living.

However...IT FUCKING SUCKS BALLS!!!

Ugh.

My sister is the rock in my life. Having been living with her again these last couple months have helped guide me the right way. Lena has always made the righteous choice in life. She's such a powerful human being, I admire her abilities and occasionally envy them. Were she a man, lord knows where she would currently be in life.
She has this ability to express fact so diligently on what IS RIGHT regardless of your feelings. She's brunt, to the point, and says exactly what you need to hear.

My sympathy to cause harm to others prevents me from doing this accurately. Which is why I sometimes envy that trait. In reality it's the right thing to do.

The right thing to do. My current quest and primal focus. This lifestyle leads to a world of loneliness, as I'm just now realizing. I suppose it's how you perceive everything, but most people don't care to do the right thing. You are not likely to be around those people long provided you stick to your guns. 

This is fine, and something I'm prepared to endure. It gives my soul room to breathe, and allows me to feel all the feelings I refused to believe were a part of me.

My father is slipping away. I can feel his energy fading. I don't feel such sadness for the moment as I believe I should. The sadness the future is bringing is not just one of a loss in his physical place on this earth, it is the mountain of potential that man was blessed with he did not capitalize on. It is the fact that his final season of life was spent in such a negative place. Was this life for him to experience such regret? I know he feels it, I see it in his eyes. I see behind the visage that has always been my fathers words. I just don't know what to say or do. He has never been one to listen to reason. A believer of his own words whether or not they may be true.

I want my life to give him as much purpose as anothers life can offer. He is endlessly proud of who I am and what I've done. Constantly being told and hearing the genuine sincerity that my presence makes him feel better. I do not require the same of him, and not having the capacity to reciprocate that I think weighs on my soul just slightly.
 That man was my icon, my life for those few years. He was all the strength I wish I possessed. No fear, always on the offensive, a master in the art of manipulation. A true warrior spirit. He acknowledges duty, and duty only. I believe my father was indeed samurai once upon a time.

I am not my father, though much like him in a lot of physical mannerisms. I accept that now.

I'm not sure what tomorrow holds for me. I'm going to close my eyes and tell myself no matter what it is that does come my way, I'm going to do the right thing.

Until the last page is written. Do the right thing."

"event","Seems like every visit to this old documenting of my life I spend more time wondering how much I've changed than anything else. My last post wasn't even a year ago and I already feel so much more progressed since then. Had I only known the incline I was about to fall into.

 Everything has since been weighed and measured indeed. I now understand how important it is for me to purely focus on my life, though in a sense I always have. I have spent a good deal of time over the years worrying about others. To take a very analytical stand concerning myself, I believe I felt so inadequate about myself and socially in my younger years, that I spent the majority of my young adult life imitating the best parts of everyone else, trying to form this perfect visage. My father hated who I was when I moved in with him, and spent the next 5 years crafting what he wanted ""his son"" to be. The art of manipulation was most assuredly the best and worst thing he carved into my brain. I attest those years to most of the reasons why I wanted to change who I was. Why I really did hate myself so much, and why I am still dealing with being numb to this day. I surely don't think he meant for that to happen. He never does in any of the negative mental effects he bestows upon his children. He taught me how to deal with life better than most humans, but at a certain cost to myself.

While small battles with myself I still fight, I believe this year I have finally realized what I have been doing for so long. I'm somewhat exhausted, and yearning to move on from it. I expect nothing, I want nothing particularly, and have entered the beginning stages of reaching my zen. For the first time in my life I don't have a clue where I'm headed.

 I am starting to see the cycle of life for what it is, and am saddened. Life truly is a glorious thing for us self-aware species. It is so complex in so many ways that I can never shut my mind off to asking myself questions about it. To say it is anything short of a miracle is arrogance. While the almighty ""God"", as he has been dubbed in our form of communication, is obviously the most popular version (though these days I suppose that can be debatable) of how all this came to be, I simply can not be sold on what man has made of Him. Religion is a corrupt society. 
It certainly has beneficial qualities there is no doubt about that, however I refuse to believe anything outside of my own instincts. I KNOW there is something else that I cannot prove or see. There is a life force, an energy, that is tangible beyond anything else I know. I will admit however, when I find myself asking myself, or this force questions, I do refer to it as ""God"". Perhaps my being raised Catholic has something to do with that. Karma is a good example to this energy I believe. Something connects each and every single one of us. That I can feel without question. This energy can certainly, if I had to put a stamp on it, be the God we have fabricated on this earth. That can be said for any of the many super natural fabrications our race has created. 
Philosophy will tell you they all have the same common interests. Those common interests are what EVERY single human being on this earth can feel inside of them as what is right, and what is wrong. We all know the difference, but we choose to ignore these instincts as we see fit. That is selective of course. If what I believe is true though, all those questions concerning how we make decisions, i.e. right and wrong, where are the benefits/consequences? Heaven and hell are obviously what most believe to be the answer to that. I can see why that is easy to believe though. 
Life is all about balance, and the scale has two sides. Everything is pretty much split down the middle as far as right/wrong, good/bad, chaotic/lawful. Which one are you? Well, what if you aren't any of these? Then you go to hell right? Now that doesn't seem fair. Say you spend your life minding your own damn business, not really doing anything good for anyone but yourself, but not harming anyone at all. All the while, not really believing in anything but what you see. That poor person is going to burn in hell for eternity for just living the life he was given? I can't say for sure, but really I think not. The thing about BALANCE is....well...balance. It isn't any one side in general. Some are obviously more inclined to weigh heavier on one side than others. One thing I can say for certain, at least in my life, is that when I feel most at peace, is when I feel balanced. This doesn't mean I do a certain degree of good or bad things to try to feel like I've participated equally on both sides, it just means I understand and accept everything for what it is, and do what my instincts tell me to do.
 If I have to do something that is considered sinful in order to survive, then by...gosh I'm going to do it. Perhaps the balance isn't even a good/bad thing. Perhaps understanding/ignorance is more acceptable. The point is, these decisions we make are for RIGHT NOW. They are for how we feel inside at this very moment. These good things religion teaches us to do are not to be beneficial to us in the afterlife, in my point of view, but to make life better for us to live in AT THIS MOMENT. To be taught to do good things just because you will go to hell if you don't seems like a horrible concept to me. You should do them because it will make life for you and everyone around you better and more enjoyable. This is our one life after all yeah? I'm not sure where I'm going with this or how I got on such a tangent, but regardless I can't help but not feel remorse to the end of the cycle. Although if it truly is a cycle, I suppose there is no end yeah?"

Wow, has the time really passed so quickly. I swear, a well done filet feels longer than this...

I have to admit, the last few months have been an exciting progression period for me. Through the thick layer of exhaustion and suck, I know the benefits will out-weigh the opposition. The testaments to the guidelines of friendship are being measured. The testaments to stability of will are being scaled.  

My final draft will be turned in within the scheduled season.

The number of questions has lessened, and the answers cannot be graded.

I wonder what it could be that's causing everyone to be so damn bitter about that place. Hmmm...oh! That's right, a woman runs that kitchen. If Hillary gets elected we can kiss our asses good-bye. Run a fucking business with professionalism, not emotions!
I can't wait to see the morale difference when she leaves. *Maniacal laughter* Yesssssss....

Emotions...holy fucking shit emotions. I thought Amanda was a head-case, I guess I had yet to swim through the estrogen sea a bit more. I'll never understand why the first thought for some people when shits goes sour is to give up on yourself. How blind do you have to be? It's not hard to put your life in perspective, it's really not. Selfishness, plain and simple. Yet, I am stuck. I am <i>fucking</i> stuck. I need to devise a plan. All prior plans are worthless now. If only psychiatrists were less expensive.

"event","Things have cooled down finally. Whispers still roam the air, but who cares. I'll keep on listening, the more the merrier. My arsenal is ridiculous at this point. Thanks guys ^.^

The other front, not so cool. I feel perhaps I was meant to walk this life alone, yet my head high. I want to walk my road, no one else. I'm being weighed down, and it's getting really irritating. I pretty much put the chain on myself I suppose, but I can just as easily remove it. Compassion tells me no. My logic tells me yes. I laid the problems on the table, gave direction, and opened the door. To walk through it was not my decision, so do I bring about the consequences? I think so. A little more time yet to see how far this goes. I believe people have it in them to change, but even so, I don't think I can do it. Living two lives is backbreaking when you have no control over one, yet you seem to bear every consequence anyway. It's bullshit.

Be strong, or be gone. I'm done.

My presentation to Ralph is my primary objective at the moment. I figure if I present at least 5 originals, one of them is bound to make it on the menu. I feel very confident, my food is fucking bomb. Not one person there would disagree. I've expanded the box for them to the point where my head Chef asks me to create her dinners. Everyone there asks me all the time to create something original for them, and I do it every time swimmingly. Mediocrity is not my style, and Ralph knows that at this point. One month to prepare. One month to deal with useless bullshit. One month to a possible new door crafted in gold. One month to get disciplined and ever more humbled.

Pray to God I don't fucking snip that shit. My patience is wearing thin. Very thin. If you think for a second I'm going to have trouble coping you are terribly...<i>terribly</i> wrong. In some strange way I want you to. I want you to make it happen. I crave it secretly. Would I tell you? Would I risk losing that edge? Fuck no. You people that underestimate me. Silence is golden after all. Don't assume so much, it's dangerous.

Oh, and you're not sneaky. You're not exceptional in your actions. You do not have it all figured out. I've seen it all before. Over and over again, you're all the same.

The wheels of progress have indeed been set in motion. Things are changing. My ears and eyes are starting to focus more than ever. A more serious approach had to come at some point. Too much fun and games over the last couple years.

I wonder what comes next. What happens when I reach my goals? I think I want to teach, write books, give seminars, and show people how to win. It's not for everyone. Most people don't care. They take it all with a grain of salt. They just want to be happy in their own rights, and live a good life, with good friends, not caring about winning or success. They want the small moral things that should make a human being satisfied and content. The people who live too hard in our reality however, and don't want to be shit on, don't want people to tell them what's what are the ones I want to show that anything is possible with the right mindset and attitude.

"event","So I just got back from Seven Springs Ski Resort, after a few days for the Reinheart food show, and fucking A I had the time of my life. The Cleveland food show was badass because of the cruise but the scenery was no competition. It was a fantastic thing that we came at this duration of the year. The foliage was aplenty with vibrant colors at every angle. Truly spectacular.
Our condo was no joke, and on the second night I had a whole condo to myself! The view was incredible. I didn't have to pay a dime for anything =p Free food, booze, condo, tours. Fucking sweetness all the way around.

I guess this is the kind of thing that happens to management folks in the restaurant business. Not such a bad deal I reckon. On top of that, I've gotten the chance to sit down and chat with many high-end business owners. It's not hard to get their life stories, especially after a few drinks. I guess the more money you have the more you like to talk about how you achieved such success. It's whatever though, I listen and ignore the arrogance. Every word from men like this means something to me. I know at some point I'll find myself in situations that these men have already dealt with, so I'll at least have the know-how.

I never saw myself being 21 and getting this far in this industry. I really just couldn't have imagined it being possible. I guess now when I'm getting raped on a Friday-Saturday night I know it's not all for nothing. I feel fortunate to have experienced so many things at this point. If I can keep this pace up for another couple decades, I will have <u><i>zero</u></i> competition when I choose to make it big in food. I know this. If some of these jack-offs can achieve the success I have witnessed, I'm not worried a bit.

Only downfall to this was I went with 3 females employees which Tara was not too happy about. She knows me well enough to know I'm 100% faithful to her, but it really offends me when she insinuates I cheated on this trip. It's small insinuations but I shouldn't have to remind her that I am faithful to the one person at all times. She'll get over it.

Well, the Blue Wolf tavern is apparently opening up a second establishment, as well as a new catering service. I have already been offered a job at the catering service along with my current. Which could boost me to about 60-70 hours a week. Fucking A money. This however makes the prospects of YSU seem impossible. Once more I am faced with a decision. Many decisions. When it rains it does indeed pour and it really fucking sucks sometimes.

"event","So my 21st has come and gone. A monumental time that will only happen once. The best part, I remember most of it!

I did a good job pacing myself even at the Blue Wolf. By the time I left I had nine free drink/shot tokens due to everyone buying me drinks. Nicole, my homegirl at the bar, made me this specialty drink she had on her 21st. She called it The Three Wise Men. Soon after, a fellow line cook from across the bar buys me a shot and we raise our glasses. Soon after this Nicole brings me these three Jell-o shots she made at home for my birthday. They were delicious. Needless to say, within a half hour I was quite innebriated. Then the shot coins start rolling in from random people and I just had to put on the brakes. I wasn't gonna end my night this abruptly.

Once everyone from the kitchen finished we decided to skip the Babylon and head over to the Sports Grill because they have buckets 5 for 5. I got to see a few old friends from the YCC and they still offered me a job there. /intrigued. To my surprise my old friend Natalie, who is a year younger than me but shares the exact same birthday as me was there with a couple other old chaney chums of mine. It was a blast.

Stein pulled me over to the bar for a ""Car Bomb"" shot. You get a glass of this dark looking Ale stuff and a shot glass with something else in it (I don't know alcohol very well), then you drop the shot glass into the larger cup and it, in a nutshell, explodes so to speak. You have to put it down fast. This is where the straight line test would surely elude me. I didn't drink any beer after that because I knew I was teetering on the edge but we hung out to watch the Kelly Pavlik fight. 29-0 baby! Awesome to have someone from youngstown Ohio bring such a big title. He's the fucking man. Boom Boom Mancini is proud I'm sure.

I decide I need something to eat because I needed to get this alcohol absorbed before I hurled. Albert takes me to Taco Bell and we grab everyones orders and head over to my place where I have plenty of alcohol from Kelly. I didn't last more than an hour and half more here. On the bright side I crashed in the comfort of my own home. 

Then the morning comes....yeah. Overall I had a great time and love my dudes like they're my family. The only thing that would have made the night better is if my baby was with me. Regardless...or should I say irregardless, I wouldn't change a thing."

It's apparent that when I schedule things a week in advance with the consent of all partakers, that 50% will surely bail at the last minute. Seems like a fitting ratio. Bill never called back, Steve didn't feel like it at the last minute when I called him at the due time, which also meant no Alex. Kelly's text read: ""Alright I'll be there in a few"". Five minutes later, ""Ah, probably not coming now. Sry, you kick some spartan ass Benny"". 

Franks girlfriend had a shitfit because I ""offended"" her. She was whining about the lack of people and wondering why she came. Considering she doesn't even play, just sits on my computer, I said ""Well it's not like it even matters then"". Guess that's pretty offensive. Frank tried to have a little chat with me about it.
""You hurt her feelings.""
""She'll get over it.""
""She thinks you don't like her, I just wanna know wh-""
""Frank, I don't like your girlfriend. I'm sorry.""
"".....Why?""
""She's annoying"". Giggles from Stein and Willie in the background, who have also had the pleasure of listening to that girl talk so condescendingly about everything in life.
So after she storms out, Frank of course follows and that's another person down.
Stein, slightly amused by the whole situation yet, takes a gander at his watch. ""Oh shit I gotta go.""
Willie-""Yeah I better be heading out here too.""

So of course just me and Joe once more looking at each other wondering what the fuck just happened.
I'm done trying to be a good host. I'll just stick to shitty television and my trusty PC from now on. Always there when I need em.

Artistic Demographic has some seriously talented artists. I envy them so. I'm really excited about this tattoo. After this I'm gonna have to buy a bench so I can start lifting again. Wanna show this puppy off come summer :p

Speaking of, I've been gym searching lately. I really want to get fit and get stronger. Last time I benched it hurt like a bitch the next day which simply reminded me of what a pussy I've become. Dedication is discipline. Discipline is strength.

I honestly don't know if I was pissed off about it. I couldn't really put my finger on what I was feeling exactly. I wasn't mad or hurt. Feeling like you've been insulted by those you love is more of a head-cocking ""wtf...."". I would have liked to of hung around a bit longer, but that little 15 second timeframe repeated itself and I didn't really feel the urge to stick around. I guess I felt lied to a little bit. Supposedly this was something I should've known, however it's something I've focused on before so I didn't see that as a possibility. I thought about that time back in late spring. Mine was a lot more serious and putting myself in those shoes fit much nicer this time around. Putting things into perspective always seems to help a situation.

People will always change for people. Habits or character. I myself a victim of this. It's like a puzzle that you can't seem to fit, so you alter the pieces a bit and everything fits nicely. As long as the puzzle looks beautiful to those putting it together than what does it matter? I hear people say they won't change for anyone. I also have heard those same people say, in not so many words, they aren't pleased with either their lifestyle or who they are. If you find something or someone that offers you a change in a positive direction then is change really such a bad alternative? I think change in character is more of a gradual process with those influences. What a broad statement. I guess I'm comparing the two. 

I think I see her as much in a week as the time I take to eat my meals in a week. I'd like to think that the time we spend together would be more valued in a situation such as this. It seems to me every hour creates more distance. You become less in tune with the physical and spiritual persona put forth by close contact, as life throws everything else at you while you try to keep hold of those images, moments, and feelings you wish you always had. A difficult situation surely. When the distance is closed however, and everything is fully tuned and harmonized, you really couldn't want much more at that particular moment. I suppose I do value those times, but I've always valued them no matter how long they last. Every day could be your last after all. I dunno. Maybe the knots will loosen over time and these obstacles will slowly fade. It's also possible however that that will not happen and it's just going to become more of a challenge. What then? I've always believed you get as much out of something as you put in. If not more. Even getting my heart broken a year ago produced phenomenal fruits that I'm proud to carry with me today. Wisdom is a very gradual process to be sure. Some of which, unfortunately, requires not so pleasant feelings and situations. As is the way of life. 

I wish I had a witty quote from some ancient japanese dude to finish this off, but I can't really think of anything off hand.  So Lincoln will have to suffice.

<i>It is better then, to save the work while it is begun. You have done the labor; maintain it - keep it. If men choose to serve you, go with them; but as you have made up your organization upon principle, stand by it; for as surely as God reigns over you, and has inspired your mind, and given you a sense of propriety, and continues to give you hope, so surely will you still cling to these ideas, and you will at last come back after your wanderings, merely to do your work over again.</i>"

"event","Ah today was a breeze. Days like these are the rare days where I actually enjoy my job. Does that make me lazy? Hmm.

I'm starting to get into astrology again more or less. There is something simply fascinating about it. I used to read astrology books every single day until I knew each sign inside and out. Eventually I could make full Natal Charts and graph the planets on a given date. Gone are those days of studying but I still <3's it mucho.
They took Pluto away from me! Those bastards. Tis my ruling planet =( I was looking at some stuffz online and this made me chuckle. Seemed to suit me quite well.

1. Planets show WHAT in the chart. The planets in your chart represent certain universal principles.
<i>Pluto: Loss, extremely intense experiences, very old karma, total and complete changes, manipulation and control.</i>

That's quite accurate to me. I'm sure anyone can rationalize that to suit themselves somehow but it seems to hit home with me. Loss is the only factor I don't see too much into. I've had some pretty seriously intense experiences in my life. My mom kicking me out at 14, almost dying from a drug, finding out I have a brother, and of course some relationship experiences that morphed me. I find the karma suggestion amusing. I'm such a hardcore believer in the old Japanese way of karma. I find it applies to my life a great deal.
My life slants a change rarely. If it's gonna change it likes to hit those 90 degree angles. Manipulation and control is just a part of my personality. I see manipulation as a negative term however. Charming maybe? =p I can go either way.

2. Signs show HOW. The planets in signs show the style in which you manifest the planet's principle.
<i>Scorpio: Charismatic, powerful, magnetic, regeneration, intense, secretive, penetrating, do or die, vindictive.</i>

I don't even feel I need to explain this one. It's just how I am simply put. 



3. Houses show WHERE. The houses in the chart contain the planets in signs and show the various areas of life.
<i>8th: Sexuality and intimacy, money/resources of others(especially the spouse), inheritance, taxes, major lifestyle changes.</i>

I honestly haven't really dug into studying the houses all that much. I've glanced at my 8th house on numerous occasions but never really looked to far into it. Seems accurate enough but I'm sure there is more to it.

I think I'm gonna pick up some more of Linda Goodmans stuff. She was the most accurate astrologer I've ever come across. May she rest in peace. 

I feel like something huge is about to go down within the next couple months. I have no clue why. Occasionally I just get this instinct that I need to be ready for something big. Bring it on. I'm always up for a good battle.

I was very surprised and flattered tonight learning that many of my co-workers, closer to my age, look up to me. They claim the way I conduct my business at work and the manner in which I carry myself is remarkable at my age. Twas surely uplifting and gave me sort of a spark in my ass to continue and work on my ethics in the working environment. I really hope a decade from now I'll have progressed substantially. I only dream of becoming an icon to some one day. My ultimate goal in life. How far can I take it though? With each success more fuel is simply added to my fire. I've got one more leap to take before I hit the next level I feel. I know I can pull this one off. Time time time. My enemy. A powerful foe you are sir. I'll get the best of you one day.

Mmmm I <3's Halo so. Effortlessly owning n00bs is a blast. That's all I have to say about that.

FUCK this weather man! Grrr. Stupid cold. I hear this is gonna be a bad winter. Fantastic. 

I saw Oprah for the first time in years the other day. I caught a really good episode that gave me a better perspective on humanity. Life and death. All that jazz. The first female tourist to go to outer space was on. She is a young and outstandingly brilliant human being who has worked hard to get where she is today. She claimed we need more world leaders to go into space and view Earth from up there. Looking at Earth from that perspective made her wonder how we could do the things we do to our only home. I totally agree with her on that. I've been thinking that for years. I hate what we do to each other <i>and</i> our home. 
I also caught Saving Private Ryan that night. Another reminder of the way we conduct our lives. I feel so weak and pathetic compared to all those men who fought. Staring death in the face every day. It's unfortunate I cannot comprehend the full extent of the mindset you would be forced into. Life would seem precious beyond any appreciation I have for it.
It's an absolute shame we don't take more time out to appreciate what our ancestors have done to keep us free. God bless all those men and women.

Speaking of, I really hate that I'm not in the military. Fuckin' Bush. My dream my whole life was to hit the military after high-school. How unfortunate this verbally uneducated selfish prick sits on our ""throne"". I will never fight for him. Ever. War should always be an absolute LAST resort. Always. It is unnecesary and there are other alternatives out there. WWI and WWII are perfect examples of why. They also show us that we only need fight when we have to. I know damn well my country isn't in danger from being overthrown. Same with the majority of the world. However this country has hit the pits since those days. America was a very different nation then. A proud nation. I feel I was born in the wrong decade. I wish I could have lived the days of the Leave it to Beaver families with their white picket fences, neighbors that were like family, and good ol sparky with the bandana around his neck.

Maybe I'll get lucky enough to find that window one day. I like to think I have the power to make a change. Realistically I know better. *shrugs* Maybe I'll get lucky."

For the record, I couldn't be more sorry for giving you shit you didn't need. I had to bring it up though. I never want to lie to you again. Ever. If you ever need proof of my word on this subject matter since it can be proven just ask me and I'll get it. I promise. I need you to trust me because I trust you. 

I feel for some reason I made a commitment tonight somehow. Nothing changed other than an argument, but it still feels like I for some reason have just committed myself a little more. It shakes my thoughts slightly. It was nothing huge. No enormous shift in my persona, just a meager adjustment in my friendship with a VIP.

I'm not trying to flatter you to any extent in this entry, I can do that any time I damn well please. I'm also not trying to give you the impression I'm some over-bearing emotional sap who wears his fucking heart on his sleeve. I can assure you I'm not regardless of whether you care of that sort of assurance. However I want you to know your word is very important to me. As is our friendship, which has a small ways to go yet. I hope you to be my best friend at some point in time, because by putting my trust in you I feel extremely vulnerable which, as you can probably guess, does not suit well with me in the slightest fashion. I fucking hate leaving myself open for any sort of defeat in life regardless of how small. You can assure me your intentions do not merit such worry over and over, but I was given that assurance before. In no means am I stating I doubt your word. Simply put, if shit seems out of whack to you and you need a change or new direction from a relationship perspective, do not beat around the bush. Do what you do best, destroy the sugarcoating and be straight with me.

I over-analyze a lot of things as you've taken plenty note of and also mistaken for paranoia. I like to think of myself as a leader in life and hope to be successful one day because of it, regardless of my past failures. If I didn't think very hard before select decisions were made I would fail completely. I think with enough hard work and strategy I have a chance. A good chance. My point: I'm not paranoid about being hurt by a relationship as it may seem. I'm simply cautious. I trust your word and have a good sense of logic for the most part. My reasoning for my point: No one likes a relationship where they feel smothered. I'm basically stating you have all the space in the world in this relationship on my end (which I hope you do for me as well) because I trust you. Not to mention I'm generally pretty laid back and believe we should both have lives outside of this relationship we can enjoy.

For some reason I just felt like these are some things I should tell you. Weird thing is even though you've never directly stated why you act the way you do, or tell me what's on your mind, I feel like I need no clarification from you in any way which is the exact reason why I think I've been able to trust you so easily. You tell it like it is. And I love that."

It's winding me down. Slowly but surely. I could barely function by the end of the night. I snapped at just about everyone except my boss. Fuck them. Fuck hypocrisy. Fuck all this bullshit. I can't remember the last time I let things drag me down this far. My father would've had to hold the last of it. He was pretty good at that. I don't even feel like I have a father anymore. Or a mother for that matter though I see her occasionally.
Every night I walk into this barren place I call home. No one to greet me, no one to talk about my day, or even to yell at me. I walk into the dark, and I sit...and I think. 
You'd imagine I could create something useful with all that extra time out I take to make a detailed overview of this life of mine. Nay. Not the case here unfortunately. Between them and myself I'm wearing down thin. I'm right there with you Peter. I understand now.

Justice is lacking in this world. Has it always been this way or have I just failed to notice my whole life? I think of those who have it worse off than me to try and set my focus straight again. However I'm simply reminded once more that there is no justice. For the first time in ages I feel I should have shoulder length hair dyed four different colors, half of which covers the face bearing tears smearing my black eyeliner and coming to a rest on my spiked collar as I jot down my over-exaggerated emotions via El Jay or Myspace. The feeling will pass. I assure you.

Tonight was top 3, if not top, worst night at Blue Wolf since I started there. On top of the usual saturday night ballers, it was homecomming. Which meant we had a little over 60 people make reservations for <i>after</i> homecomming. It was truly a world class cluster fuck of screaming, getting burned, running into people, arguing, running, more screaming, and just losing your damn mind. On top of that, this really annoying pseudo new guy of 2 months had his first weekend night tonight. It got to the point where he was just turning in circles trying to figure out what the fuck was going on. Eventually after much screaming from the owner Brant, he was knocked off the line and replaced by Bill, who sucks just as bad. On top of <i>that</i>, our expo (the guy who calls in orders and makes sure all the food is up that is on the ticket, then sells it) also started to lose his head and didn't know what to do. He was booted off his station and moved as well. It took Brant a good half hour to assume control of the situation and we all got reemed into hard. All my steaks, ribs, burgers, and filets were on par and I had nothing come back which made me happy, but it was an almost overwhelmingly exausting night.
Once I had the chance to go on break I went behind the locker room building and sat in the rain. I almost cried. My head was spinning and I was ready to lose it. I don't crack under pressure, it's not my style. It would just make things a lot easier if others didn't either. I'm sick of picking up these lazy fuckers slack. It's getting really old, really fast. I don't get paid enough to do this shit. /whine

L.A. is looking more and more convenient with each passing hour. I'm supposed to hook up with my ""brother"" today and get to know him a little better. I hear if you live in L.A. for a year the schooling is free/very cheap. If this is true I'm probably gonna hike my ass sooner than later. 

Change is a very difficult thing for me sometimes. I've become very used to this crap of a lifestyle I live unfortunatly. On top of that I've just recently found something around here worth sticking around for. I just hate knowing that the decision I need to make is going to take me away from it. I've got to do what I've got to do though. I know this. I won't regret it. Last thing I need is more regrets.

I never thought it would happen this fast. It hasn't even been a year yet. I can't tell if I made a mistake or not yet. I hate myself for allowing it to happen so easily. I just know if history has its way with me it will surely be the last."

Good day off. Really did nothing for the most part. Relaxed a bit. Pondered life and all that jazz, the usual. Sent out a bunch of checks and bills(good-bye money), one of which was for her birthday gift. ^.^ I'm exceptionally excited to hand this to her. Probably my best gift idea ever with anyone, no joke. You'll thank me regardless of how much you told me not to get you anything trust me.

I lifted today with Albert. Didn't realize it had been so long since I hit the bench. My pecks are killing me now. This is my new motivation to lift and work out as much as possible. I hate it when I lift then my body takes it like a bitch. I know I can do better than that! I'm heading for a serious diet change again I can feel it. Anytime I feel like I'm getting lazy I proceed to do something drastic. As is my nature.

I didn't realize I felt the way I do about it. Analyzing over and over and over probably isn't such a good idea but what's one to do. Human nature intrigues the mind far too much. I've played out about 5 different scenarios and I think I have it nailed down if things continue the way they are. It's that sixth sense. I've been underestimated methinks. I know my enemy, I know my own capabilities.

Today has been an interesting day to say the least. Out of no where my brother whom I've never met and barely know exists e-mails me via myspace.

Reading someone calling me their little brother was a bit of a shock. I really don't know what to think of it yet. I'm sort of excited though. I always wanted a brother growing up, though I wanted to be the older one. He is very successful however and I have a lot of questions for him. It's going to be somewhat strange giving him that first initial call and I'm kind of nervous.

I can't wait to start school. I have to take my ACT yet but I don't mind. I need this. 

Am I doing it for the right reasons? I question it myself sometimes and I shouldn't. How well will I be able to deal with it when things get shaky. I may over react. I can see me doing that. I don't much care though. One day at a time, like everything else. Good Luck Ben."

I can't believe how annoying she is sometimes. Maybe I'm just being a grump today, I dunno. I don't care about your life! I can't send enough signals stressing that fact without being completely impulsive and insensitive. I guess I really don't have it in me to be a total asshole. Shame. Maybe she'll get lucky enough to push the right button. Then it's sure to be nothing but a memory.

*pokes self* Am I there yet? No, in fact you're going in the wrong direction. I know, I have been for a while now. Then why ask? Maybe I just like to remind myself it's there. Ah.

Today I asked myself why I want to be remembered so badly. I think maybe that's why Achilles was my favorite character in Troy. We share the same interest. All in all people just ignore most things in the past anyway. Yeah I remember those that shaped our history. Those that created The Declaration of Independence, a culmination of over a century of colonial life. Those that fought and the famous generals that shaped the face of war, like Douglas MacArthur in all his wisdom and bravery. A man truly to be respected. When you talk of such historic figures you don't really see the man as a person really, but the actions they executed which made them famous. These actions and recorded words they spoke create the man.

Yet when the day is out I'm surely more worried about my life than whatever respect I owe these individuals. So I ask myself why is it so important to me to be remembered, since most don't give it a second thought? I realize that these personas created through time do have the ability to inspire. I have the utmost admiration for many historic figures. Maybe I just hope to do something that would inspire others one day. I guess I just want to be looked up to as a symbol of something strong or successful. It seems like a really selfish or egotistical life-long goal, not to mention far-fetched. I can't help how I feel though.

Work this weekend was a breeze all things considered. A sunday off is always cool in my book, especially when topped off with a Katie.
I get to start training the new kid tommorow. Let's just hope I'm able to get up in time. I was late twice this week. Twice! I'm never fuckin late. I don't think I've ever used that much profanity in a 10 minute span of time before while on my way to work. Brant said he didn't care but I still felt shitty about it. Being late to work is one of my biggest pet peeves and I hate it when people are late on a constant basis. Shows much lacking in pride of your work.

So I definatly need to make time for YSU this week no matter what day. I'm hoping I don't have much trouble getting all this sorted out. I'd like to feel like I'm doing something productive.

I really wanna go to Atlanta and see my sisters. I miss them. Lena is apparently moving back to Ohio which would be awesome. Southern Ohio but 7 hours closer nonetheless. I hope sticking around here in Youngstown for school was a good choice. It's hard to leave your home behind. Everytime I leave I always get homesick after a week or two. Not terribly but it just feels right here. I hope I can shake that eventually.

I can't believe I said it again. It just felt right. The words were hard coming out and unsure. Am I gonna regret it again? We'll see I suppose. I ask myself how I even know if I really do. I don't think myself to be one of those who loses their correct point of view whilst in an intense moment with someone else. I would prefer to keep my head on straight at all times. I went through it over and over again in my head even before. There is no concrete definition for it I feel personally. Everyone validates it in their own way, be it a gut instinct or a structure of wants and ideals. There are a lot of things that go hand in hand with the word. I dunno really. I thought I knew it...no I did. I don't like to think so but I know I did. Guess that's just how I know then. It's only slightly different this time, and I think maybe just because the connection is different in this case. I like what I'm seeing here. Let's just hope I'm making the right decisions this time and I keep my eyes and ears open."

I feel perhaps I just miss writing in general and this seems to be the most logical place to do it for the time being. Eh whichever, I welcome me back.

I've been spending the better part of my night attempting to self-motivate this glob of lard I carry around day-to-day. I went jogging after work, figured out a diet plan, went to Wal-Mart and bought some water/propel, and have spent the last half hour looking at some fitness equipment and training gear. I'm aware I'm over sensitive about my weight. Yes I'm ok with that. 

In fact I don't even see that as a problem. I think too many people are content with their health just because it's easier to do nothing. I remember being in a relationship where I became so comfortable with my life I just didn't care. Sure I gained 25 lbs but what the hell right? I didn't care.

Nothing in my life has ever felt like more of an accomplishment then getting as far as I have however. From 300lbs to under 200 (at one point) I have indeed taken strides to better my health. It just feels so damn rewarding and I wish I could motivate others to do what I've done. Especially those who are miserable because of poor health. I do not pity them however, as I'm perfectly aware it's their own faults.

I always think I should have stayed in sports. I was made to be an athletic person I think and somewhere along the line I just bitched out. Had my father raised me I would have been an athlete for sure, but I would probably be an asshole as well. Sometimes I like to stand there and stare at my old football trophies from my preteen years. If only my competitive nature had been applied to sports then. That didn't creep up on me until years later. Now everything is a competition.

So I'm gonna go to YSU for advertising come January I'm hoping. I'm very anxious to get back in school and apply myself like I know I should have years ago. If there was ever a time not to fuck up, this would be that time. I think this could possibly be the turning point in my life with the way things have been going in every aspect of my life. Work, relationships, friends, and now school. Things have changed quite a bit recently.

I think about some of the parties I attended in high-school. Football as a kid. Girlfriends. School. My mother when I idolized her. Digging tunnels in the snow with the neighborhood kids. Playing down the street with Missy and Doodles. Watching saturday morning cartoons with Anna as I held a bowl of cereal in my hands.
Where did the time go? Every day goes by faster than the next. Edward Norton was right, we are all dying one second at a time. I took a deep breath and stared at the moon as I unpacked my car tonight. Time just seemed to stop. I felt the air around me and took it in, wind rustling the old tree in my backyard I climbed with my cousins as a child. I sort of watched my life up to that point in that brief moment of peace. I felt really good about being alive and fortunate for what people have done for me. I thought of Katsumoto's statement to Nathan Augrin in <i>The Last Samurai</i>, ""Life in every breath."" It made sense for once."

Nobody as of now.

26) Are you impatient?
I have my moments.

It's a process really. No matter what any woman says they like assholes. Not assholes as we all picture them but some asshole like qualities. You have to let them know you actually give a shit when you ask them questions and be sincere about some stuff. Being funny helps too. Girls like a guy that's funny. I have some tricks but hey, that's why they're secret.

50) Do you have a.d.d.?
I was diagnosed when I was younger and took pills but I think that is a total bullshit diagnosis. A fuckload of people get distracted easy. Doesn't mean there is a disease for it.

62) What is your favorite candy?
Heath bars. Like seriously try one. What is that crunchy caramel shit? It's not caramel I don't think. It's just so delicious, so sweet, so.....this is a bad question for a faithful dieter."

"event","My mom really pisses me off sometimes. Just because I couldn't care for a dog when I was fuckin 13 I guess that's supposed to mean I'm totally incapable of dealing with one at 20. Let alone a Doberman, Rawt mix. After 20 minutes of arguing with her about it she refuses to allow a dog into this house. I personally don't give a fuck. I'm getting this dog wether she likes it or not. I've been paying the bills and taking care of this house for 2 years and everything is fine. I'm a responsible adult and she needs to get that through her burned-out head.

This weekend was pretty good. Made and event of the whole weekend pretty much. Party friday, kicked it with Joe saturday, Rib burn-off and a movie yesterday. Not too bad. I feel so much more active now since I've lost a bunch of weight. Today marks week 7 of ze diet. My sisters dropped out of it unfortunatly. I dunno I know they could do it, they're just being lazy about it. I guess when you're married and makin good money you're supposed to live comfortably anyway right?

I'm thinking about tracking her down. There is some stuff that I want to give her and some things I want to say that would ease my mind.

Can't wait until this weekend. Cincinatti and no work. That will be pretty sweet.

Here is an update on what I look like now. I haven't weighed myself in the last 6 weeks but I'm assuming I've lost about 25 lbs.

Yay finally got my contacts again. That makes me happy. I hate wearing my glasses. Didn't even cost a hundred bucks for the examination which was sweet.

I can't fuckin wait to get my digital camera. 7.1 Megapixels for 175 bucks. You can't beat that shit. Nope nope.

I called up Jerome from the Youngstown Sports Grill, the kitchen manager there and my old kitchen manager at YCC, and he said he could get me a morning shift most likely which is awesome. Only problem is when I get this puppy I won't be able to take care of him so I need to choose one or the other. I want my puppy :(

So Cheddar had a party after work last night. I figured fuck it, it's been a long time since I even attended a party so I came along with my beer bong. Oh what a bad idea. I mean, I had fun but 3 beer bongs in and 4-5 beers after and that was it. I was on the back patio paying homage to the backyard. I was owning Asshole though. I was President most of the game and when I wasn't President I was VP. Fuck yeah. I feel bad for puking on his couch.

Needless to say getting up and running my errands today was fuckin shitty.  Oy I don't wanna work today. Gotta pay the piper though.

I picked out my puppy in the litter while I was there. He is SO fucking cute. The cutest of the litter. Dave wanted it but I had claimed it already. Hah! 

Cheddars again tommorow. Him and his band are gonna be practicing so I'm gonna check them out. Guess he's into the industrial/death metal kind of thing so it should be interesting.

Ugh better go freshen up before work. Definatly not making a habit of this shit. I dunno how people do it."

Woke up and said to myself, ""Self, get off your fat ass and do something productive."" Got up. Brushed the teeth, did some push-ups, went to chaney and jogged a couple miles, now I be cleanin the house all shiny like. Think I may do some yard work if I have time before work. Hopefully the rest of the day goes this well. I always feel like I have more energy when I do this kind of thing. Yip! ^.^

"event","Yeah it figures. I finally make up my mind but I guess it was too late. Timing is always my issue it seems. I've said it before and I'll say it again, it is what it is. No reason to dwell on it any further. Probably best not to get involved in that respect anyway.

Seems like every day goes by at more brisk pace than the one prior. I feel like I'm on a treadmill that just keeps speeding up. Ultimately I just seem to be going no where fast. I should really pick this bible up and study more since in the end I'm really gonna need something that actually matters. I know damn well none of this does.

I wish this computer would blow up so I would stop using it. I'm always bitching about rather doing things more productively but nothing ever gets done unless I have no other alternatives.

Fuckin A I feel shitty after that. I'm just gonna forget about it in a couple days anyway so its significance now should be irrelevant being doomed as it is.

Alright I'm gonna quit bitching now. No more typing in this thing until I have something worth typing.

"event","Wow talk about fucking pointless. Not that I was making any progress in my day otherwise but damn that was boring.

So I spent the better part of my first 7 waking hours playing Oblivion. Gee who would have thought. Luckily Drew and Kelly stop in to take the addiction away from me. Surprisingly I put up no resistance. My back was killing me anyway so I didn't really care. That thing needed to go.

So Tricia calls me asking me if there is some huge party goin down at my place since apparently the two cars in my driveway (one which doesn't even run) mean there are huge parties going on at my place. Apparently they were all hanging out at Rae's place and being she lives a walking distance of about 1-2 minutes away I figured what the hell. Not like I was gonna do anything but sit on my computer or work out anyway. So I get some clothes on, put on the curve and trot on down. I walk into the kitchen to everyone standing there just kind of staring at the ground.

Ben: ""Wow this looks....exciting.""
Rae: ""Yeah...we're looking for something to do. We're bored.""

So we hop on over to Tricias place since her mom is out of town. We were all just kind of hanging out and bullshitting. Not too bad at first. Rae went and got her ps2 for Katamari Damacy while Tricia and some dude went skinny dipping in her pool. Heh. That was amusing. I noticed they disappeared so I had to investigate being the nosy guy that I can be. I open the back door and I see two heads in the pool with some clothes laying out.

""Well well what are you kiddies doing eh?""

""Haha. Ummm....I'll give you one guess""

So I just shut the door and preceded to sit in the living room where we all ended up for the last fucking like 3 hours watching tv. Unfortunately Rae drove me so I couldn't leave. Ugh that was such a waste of time.

Maybe, Rae. It is what it is, but I've thought about it.

I think I'm gonna get that puppy from Cheddar at work. I really want a dog.

The bandana/trucker hat is pimp so you shut up :-p

I'm starting to draw again. I fucking love drawing. I didn't realize how out of practice I got. I can't wait to get better though. I'm excited.

That's about it kiddies. Peace El-Jay"

"event","Ahh more thunderstorming. Gotta love it. I almost want to go out and watch the rain for a while. Alas the El-Jay was tugging at my pantleg. It's ok I'm here for you.

Today totally sucked the big one at work. I pulled my back out or some mishap like that when I was playing volleyball. It's just gotten worse and I couild barely even stand up without excruciating pain. How lovely. However being the stupid workoholic I can be sometimes, I wouldn't call off work. Haven't called off once since I started there and it's been 9 months. I really should have. Cause damn. Ouch. I took three tylenol from the medicine cabinet at work and they did nothing for me. My boss got a prescription excedrin from his car though and that helped out a lot. I was pretty much in a catatonic state afterwards but it helped. Looks like I'm gonna have a date with the chiropractor here soon.
Mmm more money gone to waste.

I'm picking up <i>Tai-Pan</i> again. I can't wait to get more into this one. Shogun was amazing and this seems to be no underdog. I expect great things.

I really need to land a second job. I'm sick of having no money. I'm not gonna do this shit for much longer. School is an order.

Seems like I'm thinking more and more about the past. Not really dwelling so much as it just popping into my head when I see random things. I think of all the thing that went right and wrong. Everyone was wrong in the beginning. None of it my doing but it got right eventually. I guess because it was right with me the whole time and the right of the whole thing in general not being my choice is the reason why I was doomed to begin with. Not that it really matters ultimately but just another thought.

If I could be any animal I would totally be an eagle or a lion.

Drew is finally taking the 360 away from me at my request. Tis the only way to kick the habit. I can feel the withdraw building within me already. But it *twitch* had to be *twitch* done. 

He requested I teach him to cook some saute dishes last night so I went grocery shopping a bit. Plan was to make a Chicken Alloutte. Mmmm. That's good shit there. Wouldn't ya know it though I got all the stuff prepped and ready to go and he doesn't show up. What a penis. Him and Kelly got into a fight apparently. If it means breaking up between them though I don't care at all. He's still a penis.

Mmm sleep feels good.

My gut is going away really good now. Sweetness. I haven't weighed myself but by the look of things I may be really really close if not there at my lowest weight before. Today marks week six of my diet. I'm estimating a 20 lb loss so far. W00t. I hope my sisters are doing just as good.

You should totally fake being my crazed rabid lustful girlfriend. Then maybe I'll actually get women all over me :-p

When it rains it pours as my mommy always tells me.

Since you lack the capabilities to do back-flips for me you're no longer worth my time LJ. *Shakes head* What a shame."

Went and played volleyball at boardman park with some people which was awesome since I haven't done anything in a while. Heh, I miss boardman park. Holds a few interesting memories to say the least.

Afterwards got my swimming trunks and hopped on down to berlin lake with Drew, Albert, and Kelly. Fishing really isn't so bad as long as you bring bug spray. Grrr bugs. 

I've discovered Drew really sucks at holding his breath underwater. I got a 1:10 seconds but I could have gone longer. I just thought they all had come up by then. Albert, being the one-upper that he is, enjoyed a 2:00 on the dot ass whoopin. Pfft. Whatever. I just choose not to be better than him.

So that was pretty much my day so far. I'm fuckin tired man. Not used to this lack of sleep thing. I don't know how you did it for so long. Of course caffeine and myself don't really get along like you two do."

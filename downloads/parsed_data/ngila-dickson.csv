"event","I know this comes a bit late, but I wanted to wish a Merry Christmas to all of my dearest friends. I especially would like to extend my warmest festive greetings to those amongst us who are celebrating their first holidays apart from loved ones (Viggo & Mark, just to name a few). I hope that the both of you were able to find warmth & comfort in the presence of family & friends.

This was my first Christmas apart from Hamish. I had been invited to spend the week with Eoin's family, but declined in favour of spending the time alone. Since his passing I'd been trying to keep myself busy & preoccupied. I didn't want to feel anything. I wasn't really ready to deal with it all. So I took this past week as an oppertunity to get to know myself. 

I discovered that self discovery requires a few very important tools. First & foremost a new pair of flannel pyjamas (<a href=""http://www.sleepyheads.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=NN1SOC&Category_Code=NNNF"">Nick & Nora</a> of course... isn't the sock monkey print too cute? Love it!). Also important to self discovery are cozy sheets, a few good books, a well loved copy of Fried Green Tomatoes, kleenex, pencils & a notebook & tons of egg nog (to add a a festive touch).

I spent the week making lists & writing letters to everyone in my life (expressing my appreciation, my envy, my anger, my lust & longing). Of course these are personal letters & as much as I wish I could say everything I meant & have everyone understand the depth of my feelings about them, they will never be mailed. I'll guard them close to my heart & be satisfied that the words are out of my head even if they haven't departed my lips. My heart feels lighter for having done it.

Christmas was great. I spent most of the day in bed (~*surprise!*~). I didn't emerge from me bedroom until well past noon. I hadn't made any meal plans. I just thought that I'd spend the evening soaking in the Jacuzzi, marinating in Sherry & listening to Verdi, but Marijke dropped by around 2 bearring a turkey & assorted trimmings & we spent the whole afternoon preparing a delectible dinner for 2. I don't quite know what I'd do without her. Bless her sweet heart. 

I've realized that despite my love of my home & my property that I do have to spend some time away. My relationship with Eoin is and has always been unhealthy & I'm not sure that any feeling that I've had for him has been genuine. He's a person... not my pet & shortly I'll have to let him go. I think that I may have been on the right track the other week when I was trying to leave. I'm not quite sure where I'll be off to (within a few days I should know), but by new years I expect to be somewhere away from here. 

If anyone is looking for a place to stay in NZ for some time (a few months) I will be needing someone to watch the property while I'm gone. If you're interested just email me or IM me.

I should be around for the next few days, but just in case I'm not I'd like to wish everyone a Happy & Safe New Year!

Take Care. XOXO

"event","Today I felt 'twitchy'. There's really no better word to describe it. I needed to be out. I wanted to go away, but I had no reason to leave and nowhere to go. 

I just got in the car & drove. Next thing I know I'm standing in the airport looking at a departures board thinking where the hell do I want to go. I had no bags in hand, but I was ready to fly.

I found my self drawn to places like Tokyo, Kwala Lampur, Hong Kong. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was the need to be lost in a crowd. To feel surrounded. Perhaps it was a need to stand out... to feel foreign or exotic.

I stepped up to the ticket agent & was ready to charge a ticket when my cell rang...

... it was Eoin... I'd left a pot on the stove... or some other nonsense... I can't remember. It's not important anyways, I'd been called home."

"event","I have to appologize to all of my loved ones for being away so long. I assure you that I missed you all, but I had to leave for reasons both physical & emotional. Since Ham's passing I'd realized that I wasn't being a whole heck of a lot of fun and that I was becomming somewhat of an introvert and alienating most of my friends. So I embarked on just over a month of 'responsible' introspection and self discovery. 

I spent a week or so in bed with a stack of chick flicks and after a bottle of champagne and Fried Green Tomatoes I was inspired to remodel the house. Tawanda brought down a few walls upstairs in order to expand my studio, but in the process I accidentally took out a support wall & at 3 the next morning part of my roof came crashing in. It's okay though... nothing was hurt other than my pride and my iBook (it was totalled, thus the sojourn from writing).

Naturally I called Eoin & he got together a few contractor buddies and they've been putting the house back in order and making a few more changes to make the space a little bit more my own. While renovations were underway I spent the month at Marijke's meditating. I'm feeling much better now.

I guess I failed to explain how Eoin is out of police custody... I'm not going to go into detail, but through much investigation and interrogation they finally figured out what we'd been telling them all along. Ham had had a stroke at a really inoppertune moment & fallen. My prints were everywhere because it was my house and Eoin's were everywhere because (...how shall I put this delicately...) I was cheating (as often as I could). I guess that makes me a wretched person, but I'm human & my marriage wasn't in the best of shape. Had Ham survived I'm not sure that our marriage would have. Fate & coincidence sure make strange bedfellows.

Now my only regret is having burried Hamish on the property. I still love him dearly for the great times we had prior to the end, but his presence is always felt. I would really like to have Eoin here with me, but I feel guilty having him in the house. He's living in the guest house at the moment, but he feel unwelcome. Selling the house isn't really an option either. After all Hamish will always be here. Oh well... such is life."

"event","Yet another nameless entry. I'm not in the mood for speaking. This is the first time that I've communicated with anyone since the end of last week.

Ham's funeral was on Thursday. The turn out was small. As I mentionned before Viggo was present. Marijke, Peter, Fran & Phillipa were there along with Hamish's family & a few of his colleagues from the University.

I can't say much about the service. It was short & pleasant. The officiant had many kind words to offer, but you could sense all that went unsaid. Everyone knew we were in trouble. Everyone knew we were living apart. I don't feel they understood we still loved each other. I felt a lot of them may have felt I was complicit (directly or indirectly) with his death.

Hamish's memorial is beautiful. I had a colleague of Ham's design and construct a slate & granite water fall & koi pond. I've been spending much time outdoors feeding the fish and tending to the shrubberies and ornamental ginger that were planted alongside his grave. I speak with Ham for hours. Its strange, but I feel listened to and understood. I hope that he forgives me for not having been there... but really I couldn't have been.

After the service invited everyone in for lunch. I had catered a buffet lunch. It was lovely, but honestly I can't recall a thing I ordered... it just doesn't seem important.

The whole affair was over by three & only Marijke, Viggo, Peter, Fran & Phillipa remained for dinner. I'm so appreciative of their friendship and company.

Now everyone is gone & I'm left to face my answering machine & an empty house. My voice mail box is full & I'm dreading returning every call. Most are condolences, a few are from the investigating officer that is handling Ham's case (I think that he's slowly comming to realize, from speaking with Eoin & myself, that Ham died of natural causes while going through an absolute shit seperation & nothing more).

I also have to send out my thank you cards to all of those who sent flowers & care baskets. A most special thanks to Dom & Dommie for their basket & drawings (Dommie sent a portrait that looks very much like a zebra in red stillettos & the caption reads ""Ngila in horizontal stripes"")... I love you boys & I'm sorry that I haven't been around to offer my support during your most recent troubles.

Take Care.

"event","I can't say that I've ever had a particularily strong faith, but it is times like these that make me believe that there is a greater force that protects us all and provides in our times of need. Though I wouldn't be so bold as to give this force a name... this force has blessed me with the best of friends. 

I understand that not all my friends could be with me the last few days, but those who have come have definitely helped me find my composure. My biggest thank yous must go to Peter, Fran, Phillipa & most especially Viggo. I've been running around so frantically the past few days that the gravity of what has just happened hasn't had a chance to set in. 

Today my friends pulled me asside for some much needed R&R. Peter, Fran & Phillipa stayed with Ham's family finalize our plan's for Thursday. I had really wanted to meet with the caterors myself, but Pete ensured me that he had everything under control. This left me free for a day with Viggo.

It was so nice to see Viggo again (its been nearly a year now). He's one of those people whom I can never tire of. He's also one of those people whom you can spend every day of your life with and still know absolutely nothing about. He's such a renaissance man, he's gifted in practically everything (poetry, music, etc.). I find his presence soothing. 

Today Viggo swept me away to a remote area in the South Island to go Trout Fishing. I have to admit that I've never fished before, nor was I really inclined to fish, but it seemed like a good oppertunity to get away. I packed my sketch book and Viggo brought along his rods, tackle & camera. We were out before dawn & watched the sunrise together. Viggo fished most of the day as I sketched and read. The scenery was just out of this world (I know that I'm blessed to have seen most of my country, but occasionally I can't still find a place of astounding beauty which I haven't yet seen).

Just before lunch Viggo tried to teach me to fly fish... needless to say it was not a wise idea. So long as he was helping me, casting was a breeze. As soon as he stepped away I managed to hook his shirt & shoulder with my fly... we probably should have gone for stitches, but he's a tough guy... he didn't say a thing. For lunch we grilled some of the trout that he had caught. I hadn't tasted anything quite so good in ages. 

After lunch we just sat & chatted for the longest time as we watched the clouds go by & the sky change colour. It was the first time in over a week that I've had the chance to cry. I wept until there were no more tears. As much as I've known (for a while) in my conscious mind that my husband is dead, it only really struck me that he's left me. Without him I feel alone & incomplete. I'm too young to be a widdow. One thing that I did take away from my time with Viggo was a new resolve that I have to find a project. I really need something of substance to occupy my time. I think we both do.

We've only just gotten in. Everyone else is asleep. I have to get to bed now or else I'll be a zombie tommorow. 

Goodnight."

"event","I have to appologize to all of my LJ friends for my absence as of late. For those who have been tuning in regularily I'm sure you'll understand... its hard to sit in front of a computer and compose your innermost thoughts, desires, fears etc. and repackage them for mass consumption. This isn't a farewell as it may sound... just a rededication to try harder. 

I can't recall how long it has been since I've written. Probably three weeks, but it feels much longer. Ham's family is in town. They arrived (at my request) shortly after my last entry. It was becoming exceedingly difficult to be both a dutiful wife and attempted murder suspect simultaneously. Increasingly it was becomming evident that keeping Ham on life support was not in his best intrest and being implicitly suspect I was not in any position to be making decisions on his behalf. Last week I spent most of my time in legal proceedings with Ham's siblings (to transfer power of attourney over Hamish to them so that they might do what's most humane). 

After much deliberation they removed Hamish from life support at 4:30 pm yesterday afternoon, he died 32 minutes later.

Today the family has been working hard to make funeral arrangements. We've decided that Hamish will be buried on our property. Prior to his passing he hadn't expressed last wishes. It was decided that it was a fitting resting place as Ham had been very involved with the design and construction of our home and that he had produced much of his best work there as well. There is yet much work to be done. We're waiting on a burrial permit and trying desperately to find a landscaper to create a suitable and appropriate resting place (Eoin is presently in police custody... I'll elaborate another time).

Arrangements should be finalized by mid week. We're hoping to hold a graveside service this Thursday at 11:00 am. Everyone is welcome to attend. There will be no visitation. If you intend to drop by, please RSVP by Tuesday so I can arrange suitable accomodations."

"event","Forgive me for the short entry, but I'm at a bit of a loss for words. If I've said it once, I've probably said it a hundred times... I feel so violated. I imagine this is what rape would feel like. F#&*ing investigators won't leave me alone. Every aspect of my life is being questionned & they've started pestering Eoin. When will they understand that I'm just an average woman in an ordinarily disfunctional marriage. 

I've been visiting Ham the past few days (still unconscious) and it preturbs me that my police detail feels that my visits are disingenuous. During our visits I hold his hand, talk to him & read him the paper. I don't know if he hears me. I'd like to think that he does. It upsets me that my guard just rolls his eyes & laughs as I spend time with my husband. He watches like a hawk to make sure I don't harm Hamish.

Its strange that asside from the anger I feel towards the police at this moment, I really don't know how to feel. The time I'm now spending with my husband is probably the best time I have spent with him in nearly 8 months (how messed up is that). He's getting the care that he desperately needed & I'm getting the space I wanted. Not having to contend with his jealousy has been a relief. 

I have always wanted to believe that there was a god & that there was some greater cosmic plan. But at times like this I just have to wonder what that plan is & what is its purpose. If there is a god, (s)he has some messed up sense of humour."

"event","I am presently under house arrest until further notice... they think that I tried to kill my husband.

I'm so upset I don't even know where to begin... I guess it all started on Sunday when I realized that I hadn't seen Ham in a few days. Being too affraid to go to the house by myself I called a friend of mine, Dafydd, who is with the local police department. Dafydd accompanied me to the house. When Hamish didn't answer the door we entered using my key. 

Following a brief search of the house we found Hamish face down at the bottom of the basement stairs. Naturally I was (and continue to be) hysterical. Dafydd immediately called for backup an peramedics as I rushed to Ham's side... he was still warm... & breathing.

At this point I wasn't suspected of anything.

I rode alongside Hamish en route to the hospital (as any dutiful wife would have) and spent much of the remainer of Saturday between the ER, OR & ICU. Ham underwent surgery to elivate pressure on his brain caused by a ruptured blood vessel. It appeared that he had had a stroke, but its hard to tell because of other facial & cranial trauma that he'd suffered in the fall. Ham is presently on a respirator & the prognosis isn't good.

Oddly you'd think that something like this would have me excited considering the present state of my marriage, but no... it doesn't. As much as no one would believe me I really do love him. I know it doesn't make sense, but I love him. I'm not ready to be a widow.

All of Saturday the hospital staff was very kind & curteous (just as they had been with Ham's first stroke and the heart attack he suffered last fall), but that soon changed when Dafydd returned to the Hospital early Sunday morning.

At 3am Sunday morning I was arrested for the attempted murder of my husband. During preliminary investigations they had discovered that my personal effects were missing from the house and they had also found Hamish's PI's phone number (he had told the police all the sordid details of my trip to New York & Hawaii). The police had also claimed that they found my fingerprints all over the crime scene (which is utterly rediculous seeing as it is MY HOUSE!. Besides I had been at Marijke's house the entire week).

In jail I was treated horribly. I should hope that I never habe to go back there. It took an eternity for them to allow me my one phone call. Naturally I called Marijke. She in turn called Peter who then called a Lawyer. I have been temporarily denied bail, but rather than stay in jail I have had to forfeit my passport and I have been fitted with a surveillance anklet and assigned a police detail.

Until they sort this think out I am under close scrutiny and Ham is on life support...

... why can't anything go my way.

On Friday we were supposed to meet with a new therapist. We had saught out a new shrink together & re-committed ourselves to dealing with our problems like mature adults. Ham didn't make it to our appointment. At first I was rather angry. Seeing as I had already paid for the hour, I took it as an oppertunity to vent my frustrations. I must say that our new therapist, Shelagh, is a gem.

Now, I'm concerned. I know that sounds wierd, but really... I'm still his wife regardless of how little he trusts me and how poorly he treats me. I want to go over to the house to check on him, but I'm affraid to go alone. 

Am I mental? What should I do?

All communication has broken down with Hamish. We tried finding another therapist for joint sessions, but its just not working. We're seeing the same therapist seperate from one another & I don't feel that we're making any progress. We both feel wronged and neither of us are willing to concede that we were at fault. Lately he's been comming 'round Marijke's late at night. He hasn't come in or even asked to see me. At all times I feel as if his eyes are on me. My flesh is burning. I love Ham, but I can't live like this. 

I've been seeing a lawyer (I don't know what good that will do). I guess I'm just looking for some direction. There are a few things that I want. I want my house back, I want my freedom, I want my husband to love & support me the way he used to (or I want him out of my life). My lawyer has suggested a restraining order, but is it really nescessary?, would it ruin any chance of reconcilliation?, are we past that point already?

God, I don't know.

On a lighter note... Thanks to Billy & Dom (Dommie too) for the teleflora bouquet. They sent me a bouquet of ornamental ginger, protea and birds of paradise (my favorite flowers). Dommie sent a picture (with subtitles by Billy). The subtitle reads ""Abstract portait of Ngila wearing a ridiculously large hat & Dame Edna sunglasses"". Thanks boys!

"event","It seems as if I've hit an all new low. The only thing is that I hit it weeks ago without even knowing it. You're probably wondering how that's possible. This past Friday I attended my first ""therapy"" session with Hamish.

Ham had made all of the arrangements, his choice of therapist, his location, his time. Little did I know it was all a trap to prove to me that I'm grossly insensitive and the world's worst wife. I was bombarded for hours about my activities of the last two months. Also in attendance was a PI that Ham had following me on every trip and tryst. I felt so violated.

What was worse than being so horribly accused was that this  inquisition happened in my own home. My haven, my sanctuary. I designed this house from its foundations up. Since it was built, it was mine (Hamish was merely an inhabitant). I walked out after 3 hours of interrogation & returned to Marijke's. Watching my home diminish in my rearview mirror as I pulled out of the driveway was painful. Now every time I pass my home my blood boils at the thought of what's living inside.

Upon my return to Marijke's I found her on her way out, she was off to visit another client. I asked her to cancel. I told her I needed to talk immediately, she said she wouldn't be long. She had laid out dinner & told me to help myself. She told me not to be alarmed if I heard noises in the yard before she came home, Eoin was working. Working indeed *evil grin*. Mlle. Ngila D was in need of company & she was going to get it.

Instead I've gone home & I've moved in with Marijke.

I felt that if I lived long enough that answers would become appearant & that life would somehow make sense. Its hard coming to terms with the fact that an idea that I have clung to for so long is absolute bullshit.

One thing that's certain is that I'm happy in this moment. I've felt better in the last two weeks than I have in ten years. I'm slowly learning that I don't need a man or a job to validate my existence.

Yesterday night I snuck out for a fag at sunset. I don't like smoking around Dommie so I walked to the beach. Sitting in the sand, I burried my toes deep in the warm cool earth & smiled. 

A few minutes later I felt cold wet aluminum pressed to the nape of my neck... it was Dom with 2 pint cans of Guiness. We sat together & watched the sunset. He told me about his day & I kept quiet about mine (Ham called earlier, not good as per usual. I may have wanted to talk about it, but it would have spoiled a perfectly good sunset).

A little way down the beach we spotted a Japanese couple in beach attire being wed by an Elvis impersonator (we both laughed & fell silent). Shortly into the ceremony it began to rain. Both of us and the wedding party converged on a picknic shelter. Despite the inclement weather the ceremony continued amongst a queer host of strangers (in addition to Dom and I, the wedding party was joined by a bunch of surfers, a local AA group and a family with crying red haired triplets from Ft. Worth, TX). For twenty minutes we watched in stunned silence. The happy couple exchanged vows we could not understand interrupted only by the sound of the occasional flush from the pay toilet on the other side of the shelter. The couple was unphased by the events. The groom appeared as proud as ever and the bride continued to blush despite her ruined hair and running mascara. I could only imagine what Dom was thinking, but strangely I was hopeful. 

This morning I woke up damp, sore & a little hung over, but envigorrated.

Watching a child can be a remarkable experience. Right now especially. Dommie's at the age where he's developping a keen personality of his own. When you look in his eyes you can see the thought process in action (forming opinions, solving simple problems & making small value judgements). 

I love taking him out to the beach. Sandcastles (or rather large muddy mounds with seashells on them) are so much fun. I was never really into them as a child. It always upset me that mine never looked right, but now I see that I missed the point. Its really about digging holes and getting dirty. Dommie has a shovel & pail that have smiley faces on them, Dom says they're from Blue's Clues -- I'll have to look that up later... I'm so out of touch.

Today (when Dom got back from the studio) Dom joined us on the beach. Dommie & I burried his dad and marked around him with seashells. Jokingly I asked Dommie if he wanted ice cream, he shook his head yes and extended his arms for me to pick him up. We began to walk away when Dom called out after us, Dommie fussed to be put down. He ran back to his daddy & put Peng down on his dad's chest & came back to me. We left Dom in the sand (with Babysitter Peng) & came back 5 min later with 3 cones. All muddied from the castles and sticky from melting ice cream I have to say that we had a great day.

Now we're home & the boys are washing up. Siri's planning dinner. We're all pretty wiped so I'm sure it will be an early night.

I'm very slowly remembering the sound of my own voice, it had been so long since I'd heard it that I'd forgotten what it had sounded like (not to sound meglomaniacal, but its easy to loose touch with yourself when your caring for someone else).

I'm thoroughly convinced that I'm in love with this house (/ neighborhood). I really don't want to go home to NZ. All that awaits me at home is a stack of scripts that I'll certainly reject and a relationship that isn't going anywere. If I feel this way in a week I may just have to get in touch with a real estate agent. I don't know what I'll do here, but I'll figure something out. Perhaps 'Ulalena is looking for a wardrobe mistress (show laundry & maintenance may not be the most rewarding job, but anything that keeps me here is a good thing).

Also, I spoke with Eoin this afternoon. Finally a converstation that didn't envolve my non-existant grass or my sad attempt to cultivate ornamental ginger. I won't go into detail, but speaking with hime makes me feel I'm 14 again. His school is now out for the summer, so he may come and join me :~) Mmmm... I can't wait *blushing feverishly*.

"event","How is it that I'm in the most beautiful place on the Earth & I'm presently so miserable.

Marcus called on me today and we went for brunch and a cruise on his yacht. After some wine & some snorkling he made a pass at me & I slapped him (how stupid can I be). He dropped me at the nearest port with nothing but my swimsuit & my sarong. I had to hitch hike back to Dominic's with a tour group (I was so horribly embarrassed. 

En route to Dom's the Japanese tourist sitting next to me asked if I would be so kind as to autograph his copy of Interview with a Vampire. Needless to say I just lost it & was asked to disembark... Grr!

When I arrived home Siri greeted me with much kindness. She poured me a drink, drew a bath for me and layed out my Kimono. Once suitably refreshed / innebriated I settled in with my iBook. I was elated to see that my darling little elf (<lj user=""orlando_bloom"">) had added me to his friends list again. I have spent much of the last few hours reading all the entries that I have missed since December. But that happiness was not to last as immediately afterwards I recieved an email from my Hamish.

I won't go into much detail, but Ham is upset with me (somewhat understandably so) for abandonning him for nearly 3 weeks. I've explained that he hasn't been easy to be around for the last 4 months and that his new condition / disposition is hard to be around and that I need space to find myself. I told him that I don't know how long I'll be gone for, just that I need me space. 

I wish he was well. I wish he could be the man I married, but reality is that he can't be right now & that as things stand, I can't be with him. How is it possible to both love and despise someone simultaneously? You'd think that after living nearly half a century that these answers would be self evident... no, not really... as I'm comming to learn, wisdom has nothing to do with age.

I can't wait until Dom gets here. I need a diversion.

"event","So I've made it to Hawaii safe & sound (not that there was any doubt that I would). I am presently so blissed out. Its strange how time seems to stand still here. I've only remembered to update because Ham called to yell at me yesterday night (you see I had forgotten [or rather neglected] to call him for nearly a week now). Feigning an appology I spent nearly an hour on the phone with Hamish and told him absolutely everything that happened in my first few days in NYC (the rest is none of his damned business). He was excited about the galleries and felt badly he'd missed the plays. The whole time I sat there wondering how did I ever live to be this old?

Back to Hawaii. I arrived late Tuesday night and met the car that Siri had sent for me (bless her heart). Dom's house is absolutely gorgeous (he / we must give sincere props to his agent for working this one out). The property is its own private oasis. From inside the gates you would have no idea that it is so close to civilization (reminds me of the Robin Masters estate from Magnum PI - for those who are old enough to remember). I've been installed in the guest house & I couldn't be happier.

The past few days I've been visiting the Kaanapali beach and working on my tan and sweating out a week long hangover. I've been snorkling and sailing a few times already. I'm hoping that perhaps Dom will teach me to surf (I highly doubt I'll be able to do it, but at least I'll be able to see that I tried).

Tonight I'll be seeing 'Ulalena ( http://www.ulalena.com/ - a colaborative show created by the Hawaiian tourist commision and the creators of Cirque du Soleil).

Unrelated: Eoin called today. On a whim invited him to Hawaii, he was flattered but he declined (too much work, which is understandable). He wants to arrange a time to discuss shrubberies and ornamental mosses for rock garden. Of course he never discusses these things with my husband & would never do so whild he's around. I wish I had a way of seeing whats running through this kid's mind. I think <lj user=""_bridgetjones_""> 
has a perfectly good word for men's cryptic messages... EMOTIONAL FUCKWITTAGE! 

Also... Welcome to <lj user=""_seanbean""> who just recently appeared on my ""friends of"" list. Nice to see you again darling.

"event","If it wasn't already evident that I'm in the middle of a full on breakdown I'll just come right out & say it. I feel that we're all victims of our own actions, but don't interpret that as meaning that I'm depressed. I'm just starting over.

This past week in NYC has been a little fucked up. When I left NZ I had a perfect little itinerary with all of my fave things perfectly mapped out. I'd planned to immerse myself in culture & have an absolutely fab time exploring the big city. Nothing took as long as I had anticipated. I had expected to spend a day at the Met, significant time at the Guggenheim, see 1/2 a dozen shows & sleep like a baby.

I can't say that anything I saw truly impressed me. Don't get me wrong, I love art & I have a profound respect for people who have / do create it, but for some reason it felt like I was doing & seeing 1/2 of these things just so I could go home & tell Hamish what I'd seen in his absence.

So by Wednesday I'd changed my routine. I went to the TKTS booth in times square & asked the ticket agent what they'd recommend & they sent me to De La Guarda. I'm not going to spend ages talking about the show, because really my words can't do it justice. Its an environmental piece (no seats, spectators move amongst the performers), the music is crosscultural (drumming, chanting) and the language is preverbal. It was exciting. I danced & I felt naughty. The show ended just before 11, but I was still awake. 

I wandered until I found a bar (Siberia: http://www.siberiany.com ). I'd been there years before when it was somewhat unknown, but it was still quite nice little dive. Siberia is quite the little hole in the wall a retreat from the mainstream where its still quite easy to go unrecognized. The people there are real and unpretentious. It was refreshing. I spent most of my next few nights drinking myself into oblivion with the next gen of literati whilst breathing deep the sweet pungent scent of cuban cigars. I've since forgotten why I gave up smoking in the first place. 

Its been a few days since I've seen my hotel room, but that's not really important. I've been spending my days wandering between Chelsea & the village. I've taken in a few street festivals & a few off-off-broadway plays & crashing with a young stylist named Sasha (I let her cut my hair... now I no longer look so much like Ann Rice... I'm still getting used to the cut, its so short, but Ham will hate it... & that's whats truly important).I just have to remember checkout is tommorow at noon. Then off to Hawaii.

"event","So I've arrive safely to NYC. It took long enough. As if the flight from NZ didn't already take ages, I spent nearly a day stuck in customs (not kidding). I thought that this only happened in fight club, but they detained me for questioning / search because my luggage vibrated *blush*.

Not wanting Hamish to find Kitty I threw her in my luggage. At the time I didn't think to remove the batteries. Appearantly when something hit my luggage Kitty got switched on. Had I been anyone else on this planet I may have been lucky enough that the batteries would have died en route... no not me... not luck at all. You see I had the extremely bright idea of using the Lithium Ion batteries from Ham's digi-cam *~doh!~*

I was so embarassed. What made it worse was that it the NYPD bomb squad & 1/2 a dozen customs agents to determine that it wasn't a bomb *rolling eyes*. To add insult to injury several of the various police / customs agents were thoroughly convinced that I was Anne Rice travelling under an alias *grrr*.

Anyhoo... eventually (& with many appologies) I was allowed to leave the airport & I recieved a police escort to my Hotel (the Marriot Marquis Times Square). The room is satisfactory though not fabulous. I would have expected better since the room is being paid for by Barneys.

It was late when I got in, but I wasn't really tired (being on NZ time) so I went to Loews to see Chronicles of Riddick. Eventhough I've already mentionned this, I was blown away. Still jealous. After the movie I still wasn't really tired so I cracked open the mini-bar & after that the world went hazy.

Woke up just in time for my meeting at Barneys today. For those who haven't been tuning in... I had lent them some costumes from the Last Samurai for a window display and not all of them were returned in tact & some not at all. I spoke with the exhibit manager (hardly-out-of-college snooty little boy). He ensures me that everything possible has been done to retrieve the items and that they have people keeping an eye out at the cities auction houses as well as eBay, but nothing has surfaced. They've made a very generous offer for a cash settlement which I accepted (I really would have liked the missing items, I had really hoped to gift them to the respective actors that wore them, but what can I do?). Left furious. 

But enough of that. Tonight I have tickets to see Wicked. Gotta Run. XOXO

"event","I'm so sorry that I've slipped into oblivion this past week. I've just been so preoccupied Following my weekly spiritual tuning with Marijke.

You see, while unburdening my psyche to Marijke I accidently let slip incident involving ever so cute Orli-look-a-like-carpet-cleaner. ""Eoin?"" (pronounced Owen) she asked quizically. To which I answered yes. She said she didn't know he did carpets & then added that he's done an absolutely fabulous job with her gardens (which I must agree are absolutely fab).

Turns out cutey is a Jack-of-all-trades... mmm... wondered if he did pools.

Anyways... ran into him trimming hedges on my way out. He called me Mrs. D! Not entirely sure if I should have been offended (made me feel quite matronly, but atleast he did remember me to some extent). So I put on my sad neglected housewife face & told him about my trouble with my current landscapers (keeping in mind that my property is wooded & has hardly any grass). He said that he would love to help and that if I'd like that he'd take a look at my pool pump at the same time (its makeing a wierd noise & doesn't seem to be doing its job, thus the gratuitous amount of algae in the water... blah, blah, blah... could care less). Turns out that he's free Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays (in the am... when Ham is with the physiotherapist *devious grin*).

As I was getting into my car (not paying much attention at all) I knocked my head hard on the door frame cutting myself just slightly (though lg amt of blood did draw some concern from delectible-shirtless-landscaper). Eoin fetched Marijke & some ice & suggested I should lie down. Agreeing that driving would not be a good idea I took a trip over to aethetician next door & had pedicure, manicure, full leg & bikini wax whilst recooperating (not what you're thinking... naughty children... I'm going to Hawaii in a few days & should like to look nice in swimsuit.

2nd attempt to drive home proved sucessful. Sacked old landscapers as soon as I got in. Ham not too happy.

Rest of the week relatively uneventful.  Went tanning on Wednesday. Spending next few days in NYC (leaving Sunday), spent most of the week packing & re-packing while watching Eoin fight with pool pump, weeding & trimming hedges... mmmm. Wondering if it would me inappropriate to invite sexy-hired-hand to Hawaii (probably... slightly affraid he'd laugh).

"event","One of my cutters from LotR dropped by for tea this afternoon. It was lovely to see Liz again (its nice to feel connected). Liz has been off on an absolutely fabulous adventure this past year (she'd been working on The Chronicles of Riddick). She'd brought by a couple of photos to show me what exactly she'd been up to. I don't say this very often, but I was simply astonished.

The costumes for CoR were designed by Michael Dennison & Ellen Mirojnick (you may remember their work from Starship Troopers). The costumes (as I'm sure you have all seen) are absolutely fab (many look to be reminiscent of the artwork of H.R. Geiger). The layers for texture and variety of fabrics used simply makes me salivate. I wish that I had had a chance to work on this film. I am so jealous that I seldom get scripts quite like this one (I haven't had much of a chance to work on anything sci-fi). I guess that in some respects I've been incredibly fortunate, but in being so I've become somewhat typecast.

Its hard for me to express the need / desire to design (especially for epic productions). Seeing as I have no children I can't equate it to childbirth. For me it is like Biblical creation (especially when you are designing fictional cultures / environments). The power that a designer wields is intoxicating. Even in a design department (where the final design may not your own) the power to approve or decline sketches is... *not able to find an appropriate word*. On LotR I felt I was Eru (for those Ring fans reading you'll understand. Eru / Illuvatar is the ceator of Ea [Middle Earth], and all of its creatures).

Now when I see production stills or watch another designer's work I can't help but feel jealous. My need to create is insatitable. I need to find myself a new script... pronto."

"event","Today I went shopping. Its rare that I do this. I find trying on clothes to be a dreadful experience. When you work around as many fine clothes and beautiful people as I have over the years dressing yourself becomes an ideal.

Everytime I look at myself in a dressing room mirror I have visions of how the garment / myself should look and how much better most things that are fashionable these days would look on someone else. I envision alterations and embelishments. By the time I've tried on 3 or 4 things I'm exhausted at the thought of the work that would have to be done for a store bought garment to be passable. As a result I normally sew (or have garments tailored) for myself. 

Today was an exception.

As I mentionned yesterday, Dom has invited me to Hawaii. Looking through My wardrobe I had nothing that was appropriate. Keeping in mind my therapy assignment and my ""What Not to Wear"" sensibilities I headed off to the mall to pick up a few summer tops, capris, sandals a sarong and a swimsuit (*God I HATE swimwear!*).

I did quite well, but it took the entire day to accomplish my errand. In addition to my shopping list I did pick up a ridicculously large sunhat, some fushia nailpolish and a pair of sunglasses that would make Dame Edna very proud.

When I got home I got to work immediately painting my toenails. Such a simple task, but for a forty-something woman of limited flexibility this can be quite grueling. Perched on the edge of the couch with my feet on the coffeetable I was doing quite well until Hamish came home from physiotherapy. As he entered bellowing ""Honey I'm home!"" I was startled and slipped from my somewhat procarious position. Ham hears the commotion and comes running only to find me flat on my ass, feet in the air and nailpolish spilt on the carpet (which is white for the record *grrrr*).

My nails look fab, but the carpet may not be salvagable... the cleaner comes tommorow. Who ever knew that self discovery and expanding your horizons could be so costly? 

Now for a Margarita to cure my migraine."

"event","Today I visited my Psychiatrist / Massage Therapist / Spiritual Guide, Marijke. Every week I wait with baited breath for the special day when I go for my realignment (spiritual tuning). For 2 hours my therapist works out all of the aches, pains & stresses of the past week whilst listening to my woes and responding with snippets of assorted eastern philosophies.

Today as I was bitching to Marijke about what has become the status quo in my life she asked me what it is that I truly want. This question really surprised me. It has been so long since I've really thought about what really matters to me. There were a few answers that stood out in my mind...
...I want to be loved...
...I want to be held...
...I want to feel appreciated...
...I want to be admired...
...I want to feel beautiful...
...I want to be touched.

It seemed to me that they were all pretty selfish desires, but I've been neglecting those needs for so long that my health and emotional stability has become somewhat comprimised. Marijke has made me understand that I can't expect these things in my marriage right now. Ham is in a place where sharing isn't easy, he needs these things from me so I need to find a way to give these things to myself.

It's so bloody simple I wonder how I hadn't come to this realization on my own. My therapist is nearly 20 years my junior but somehow she's able to make perfect sense of my life. Sometimes I find myself in awe and sometimes enammoured with her. She calls it transferrence, but its hard not to love someone who can quiet the storm inside your head.

She's given me a few assignments. First she's told me that I need colour in my life (this shouldn't be hard for a designer, but really it is). I've worn nothing, but black for years and I can see why she thinks I'm depressed... so retail therapy it is.

The next task is to do something for myself. Hamish is quite stable so its not unreasonable for me to take a trip by myself. If I can arrange for homecare I may spend a week in Hawaii (Dom Monaghan was kind enough to invite me yesterday).

My last task is to find a project (which is easier said than done). I've read a lot of scripts lately and none have struck me as real winners. I just want to find something all consuming & meaningful, something I can really sink my proverbial teeth into. Perhaps I'll give Peter & Fran a call."

"event","I am so sorry that I have been away for so long. I started this journal with the best of intentions, but my abilities to multi-task are somewhat limited.

Christmas and the last few months have been difficult. I was very torn between my remaining obligations to LotR (due to personal troubles which I can't discuss the exhibit did not come together -- which believe it or not is still a terrible disappointment) and my obligations to The Last Samurai (which I were able to fulfill though somewhat distracted).

This past Christmas I may have mentionned that Ham and I had been discussing a sojourn to Bali (which tragically conflicted with his lecturing schedule). When I left NZ to fulfill my obligations to the premieres of TLS Ham suffered a mild heart attack while I was in NY and unable to return to his side immediately.

Since then Ham and I have been at home. Tending to his health continues to be a burden. We see a specialist regularly and have been working on a diet and excecise regimen that he finds tedious and inconvenient. I try to keep my composure, but it is difficult to find yourself constantly at odds with someone whom you love with all of your heart and soul.

I hope that my friends will forgive me for my absence and I hope to hear from you all soon. Love always. Nigla."

"event","I must admit that I love having so much time to myself. Ham has been away lecturing & I've cooped myself up in my studio (cooped sounds negative, but really its a good thing). For my last birthday (I won't tell you when that was or just how young I am, you'll all have to guess) Ham renovated my studio. It was always a fair size, but it lacked natural light & somehow felt clostrophobic. With the new renovation I have floor to ceiling windows along the 2 exterior walls. The windows all pivot open (they pivot on a point in the center of the window, not from one side like a door -- hard to explain, someday if I get around to taking pictures I will show you) onto a section of our patio. We've planted a lot of thick greenery around our home so it is very private. We're unable to see our neighbors to either side (not that they're particularily close to begin with) & there is very little noise. After a while at home it is very easy to forget that there is a town around us.

For the last two days I have been painting from the sketches that I made on my last trip with Hamish. Its been a while since I've worked with oils & its seems that I have lost my dialogue with them. Its been a little frustrating, but we all know art is about process, not the final result. 

My love comes home tommorow. I'd like to do something special for him, but I haven't any ideas as of yet."

"event","I know this will sound lame (especially for a designer), but I just can't wait for Martha Stewart's Christmas mag to hit the shelves. Martha is a guilty pleasure of mine. Though I find most of her projects perfectly hideous, they do have their place. When it comes to holidays, decadent deserts & pretty drinks you just have to give it to Martha... she's fab!

Ham has brought up the idea of a Christmas party yet again. Neither of us have much in the way of extended family, but we love to be surrounded by people at Christmas. Ham's latest idea has been to invite all of our LotR friends to stay with us for a few days over Christmas (children & significant others invited as well). Anyone is welcome who is in need of an escape (from exes, in-laws, obnoxious otherwise intrusive biological parents). If anyone (in the aforementioned group) is interested please email me at ngila_dickson@thursdayschild.ca to arrange accomodation.

I have a few ideas stirring in my mind & it will take from now until Christmas to pull them off. I'd really like to put together a real old fashioned Christmas (tree & everything). We'll have to see what we can do about snow. If working on LotR has taught me anything, it's that anything is possible."

"event","After nearly 13 years, my husband never fails to surprise me. For a while now (I guess) Ham has been feeling the same frustration I have. Unbenknownst to me he planned a getaway to Mt Richmond Forest Park for the end of this past week.

He woke me early last Tuesday. Generally speaking, neither one of us is a morning person, but this time something felt different. He had already layed out my clothes & packed my bags. I knew I was in for something special.

Ham had packed a fab lunch as well as our ketch pads & watercolours.

Over the last 3 days we hiked the Wakamarina track & sketched the forrest. I'm not the best camper, but the scenery more than compensates for the stiffness that comes with sleeping out. You wouldn't believe the birds we saw (blue duck, yellow-crowned parakeet, kaka, kiwis) & the trees & flowers are just not to be believed. I think that I have enough material from this little trip to keep me busy in my studio for eons.

Sometimes you forget that to find God's country you don't have to travel abroad. There is so much around us all that is so beautiful."

"event","Tonight was the night that I was going to discuss my vacation plans with Hamish. Ham was lecturing at Massey University today, so I had taken the entire day to plan the perfect pitch & prepare a lovely dinner.

For dinner I made Som Tam (papaya salad), Pad Thai & Kha Nom Sod Sai (coconut custard). I set our dinner out in the family room which I had dressed gold & red silks and various batik & ikat fabrics. I had gathered nearly every cusion in the house & set them around the coffee table. I set the mood with candles, a blazing fire and incense.

When Hamish got home he was in a mood. His lecture wasn't well recieved by the students (but such is life when you're lecturing to undergrads).

Ham was appreciative of the dinner & the ambiance did help him relax, but he wasn't in a good place to listen to me. He hasn't said no to my idea, but made it abundantly clear that it won't be happening this year (his schedule won't allow it). He has a few more lectures to prep and publishers deadlines to meet for his latest project.

He has mentionned though that he would like us to do something special at home for Christmas. As plans develop I'll be sure to let you know. If everything comes together, it'll be fab!"

"event","This morning I visited a travel agent to pick up a few brochures. I'm thinking that I'd like to go some place warm & exotic. I've been wanting to go to Bali or Thailand for quite some time now. I really want to emerse myself in a rich foreign culture, to see it, taste it, feel it. Just to let it seep in through every pore.

I haven't told Hamish yet. I think I'll break it to him over dinner. Hopefully he'll be as enthusiastic as I am. Since his stroke in 97, he doesn't travel particularily well. Fortunately the flights are short & once we are there the trip will be leisurely and restful. I feel that a trip would go a long way to brining us closer. It'll be a chance to fall in love all over again."

"event","So it didn't take quite as long as I had anicipated to get this place looking nice. I had one of my assistants take a look at it & she got it fixed no time. I don't really think that it reflects who I am, but it looks really cute on my iBook.

Now that I'm settled here I might as well fill you in on all that has happened recently. Since wrapping on Lord of the Rings I've been spending much time at home with my husband, Hamish. During production we became somewhat estranged as so much of my time was taken up by the production.

Since finances are no longer a concern (for the moment at least) I have been taking time to take stock of my life. Looking over where I have been & the choices that I have made. I would like to say that I have no regrets, but now I find myself far from where I had intended to be when I first entered the world of fashion & design. In my 20s I never thought that I would be producing Fantasy costume drama & weekly serials.

Before trying my hand at costume design I was editor of my own fashion magazine (Cha-Cha). The magazine didn't fare well & eventually it folded. The time I spent working on Cha-Cha was amongst the best times of my life. Lately I have been considering going back into the magazine business, but before then there are a few more things that I must do (for myself & for my family).

First thing's first. I think a vacation is in order."

It'll be a while before things start looking pretty around here... they will, I promise. Most of these layouts are so hideous that they're hurting my designer's brain."

<a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2008/11/21/new-report-cia-lied.html"">New Report: CIA lied about missionary plane shot down over Peru</a>
The CIA Inspector General John Helgerson just issued a damning report that says the CIA lied about and covered up its involvement in a drug interception program with the Peruvian Airport. In 2001 the Peruvian Air Force used information the CIA gave them to shoot down a small plane loaded with US missionaries, causing the death of Veronica Bowers and her infant daughter Charity.

My prediction: no senior-level member of the CIA will be fired, punished, or imprisoned because of this. For one thing, they're untouchable. For another, the CIA needs all the people they have to run their own drug operations.</ul> <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-shootdown21-2008nov21,0,2543475.story"">Here's the LA Times story.</a>"

A part of me still loves you. I like the fact that you just announced Star Wars: The Old Republic as a MMORPG. But I don't think I can forgive you for the shitty combat that was in Mass Effect. I love your dialogue trees, but I hate what you make me do to get to them. In the past few months, I've put in an hour or two of gameplay on a planet mission that I'm stuck on . I can't get past it. I won't get past it.

So, I just wanted to write you and say that we can still be good friends.

But never lovers again.

I was watching Meet the Press this morning and remembered I should post this. Awe, the flute is so cute. And the Biden winks and repetition.

Reading the local paper, I saw a poll that said Palin won the debate. Of course, they say this because she was charming, but debate-wise, she avoided nearly all the questions. In that respect, she lost. I don't want another indirect leader.

And speaking of Meet the Press, who is this Peggy Noonan and why do I like her so much? She speaks so softly and so well-informed. Also, Gwen Ifill is much more charming as a journalist/commentator than as a frustrated moderator trying to wrangle two children."

I just bought a few supplies for my Team Fortress 2 Engineer costume. The only way I could bring myself to buy any of it, is if it could be used practically later on. So I got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQOTRI"">hardhat</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017Z04SK"">welding goggles</a>. The goggles, theoretically in my mind, will work to help see the pyrometric cones we use in reduction fires. 

I also went ahead and bought a nice N95 respirator, good to block out silica and other lung-clogging particles.

Now, besides the clothes (see Goodwill), I need to find gloves and wrench. The only way I'll get the gloves is if they can be used in kiln-firings, being flame-retardant and heat-resistant. And cover all the way to mid-arm.

I be a nerd."

"event","I had coffee with Barbara last week at the Starbucks on Navarro. It was getting dark, and the norther was feeling awfully pleasant as if it was coming with a gift in its breezy hands. A few people ask me what me and her talk about, with the age difference being the focus. I don't know. We just get along. And when we get together, we just talk randomness, and it's usually the most intelligent conversation I have had in days.

Last week, after she was telling me of her own little detective story -- a family mystery she helped solve, I ended up saying that I think we're going through a mini-depression. Nothing close of a recession, but a full-fledged depression that only lasts a year or two. She corrected me in saying that depressions aren't short-lived things. That she wishes she would never be around to see one. She implied that it's just going to be a hard recession.

But that got my mind working. I started thinking about the history books I've read, and there was a term for these mini-depressions. I couldn't put my finger on it, until I woke up this morning. ""Panics!"" I said, wiping drool from my mouth. ""That's it!""

Now if Wikipedia is to be trusted, Panics are labeled as depressions, yet they're short (from one to six years). See the Panic of 1857: ""Failure of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company burst a European speculative bubble in United States railroads and caused a loss of confidence in American banks. Over 5,000 businesses failed within the first year of the Panic, and unemployment was accompanied by protest meetings in urban areas."" It lasted three years. ... 

I wonder if you replace some of the words to read as if it were present day, how similar it might seem.

So, are we living through the Panic of 2008?
Or will we not know for years...?"

<lj-embed id=""18""/>
Yes, she probably should've known better, but she was wearing her art. My friend Gina wrote this: ""I don't see how people don't think that her rights were completely trampled on. Fear of terrorism doesn't give authorities the right to prosecute the innocent."" Followed up by,  ""I bet if she had long silky blonde hair, they wouldn't have even noticed her sweatshirt."" To which I replied, No. IF she was WHITE.
<ul>In today's episode of Boing Boing tv: One year ago, a 19-year-old MIT engineering student named Star Simpson got dressed to go pick up a friend at Boston's Logan airport. She pulled a hoodie out of her closet, a wearable tech design she'd made with a light-up LED-circuit on the chest. In her hand was a small pink rose she'd crafted from hardened clay, a gift for her friend.

A few hours later at the airport, after an airport employee mistook her sweatshirt for a bomb and the rose for an explosive implement, Star found herself surrounded by 40 armed police who believed she was a suicide bomber. She was arrested for ""possessing a hoax device,"" and an unprecedented media frenzy ensued. Here was the <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2007/09/21/mit-student-arrested.html"">Boing Boing post from that day.</a> 

A year later, after a long series of court dates, a Boston judge ruled that Star must perform community service and make a public apology. Star says she intended no harm. She believes the authorities were unfairly harsh with her long after it was obvious she posed no threat, and that legal proceedings were unduly influenced by a prevailing atmosphere of anxiety over terrorism (this just months after a similar case in Boston).

She has since dropped out of MIT, and says the school's reaction felt like ""being disowned."" She has moved out of Boston in part because of recurring threats and attacks from strangers.

Star has finally come forward to tell her side of the story publicly, and she does so on Boing Boing tv today. </ul>"

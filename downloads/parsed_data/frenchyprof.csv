"event","You know there are few things more pleasant to the ear than lines of well-written prose.  I just saw ""Music and Lyrics"" tonight and sufficient to say dutifully inspired to add an entry.  First of all, love Drew Barrymore.  If there's one girl I would leave a relationship for, it would be for her (as long as she is in real life who she is on screen).  More than her character was the theme of the movie--using carefully selected language to express meaning.  It's a powerful motive really and quite self-confirming if done right.  I never could write papers while in school, but I was a mean e-mailer.  Perhaps if only English Composition was an online course...

Well after two days of blizzard I'm sick of staying indoors.  However, with the minor bronchitis I endured, it was ironically beneficial to have had these snow days off school.  Tonight I am feeling much better (modest congestion) and hopefully can shake this bug by the weekend.

It is a goal of mine to become a writer.  Since a kid reading Dave Barry's humor column in Monday's Star, I was determined to make my writing witty and fun.  It should be obvious to those who know me best--most of my communication is meant to be appealing.  Not that I tell jokes...just spice up life a bit with some unique syntax.  And yes, I am a big nerd."

"event","Looking up my flights for this summer to France--going to be cheap out and expensive back.  That's obvious considering the time period, though.  Why did those weddings have to occur during the busy season and Tour de France?!?  Come on, didn't they think of me!?!  At any rate, I'm very excited to go back, taste some great food and soak up some more French.  My language skills have kept up nicely since my return and I don't imagine any headaches in immersion.  The plan is to leave April 2, see friends in France for two weeks, then training starts on April 15, then tours after that!  I should be very busy up until July which is quite enticing. 

Been trying to maintain some decent level of fitness (well, for a worker at Runners Forum at least) and despite this cold haven't done a bad job.  Been having to be creative with the attire but that's fine--more layers beget stronger workouts.  But I'm not getting up earlier to fix a good lunch so I scarf down the ""school"" lunch which, for those of whom it has been a while since cafeteria days, is quite sensible.  I don't miss that nasty Johnny Marzetti.

This week was a great week/nice opportunity to be the frenchy prof that I am.  I taught French at Clay Jr. High Monday-Thursday and gave those kids the most French they could handle.  I hope I wasn't over their heads too much.  

Pray for no more dreams with David Beckham, Will Ferrall and Opera!"

"event","Watching the Colts win last night was one of the greatest nights in sports history. I will always remember February 4, 2007. What a great start to a great year. Funny thing was--I was completely emotionless, numb, and speechless at the end of the game. I imagined myself streaking down the street with elation, but instead I just sat on a bench and quietly clapped my hands.

But I guess that's the best thing about the Colts' victory. They didn't win it for fame and spotlight. Not for excessive celebration nor pride. They are a good, humble team that won it because they've got FAITH and SPIRIT. And it's the credo of Christian coaches to exude exactly what Tony did last night--calm but earnest gratitude to the maker. Pretty sweet.

I don't know how crazy Indy got last night with the parties on the circle, but I can't imagine, after hearing the soft humility in Tony's and Peyton's voices, that too much extra kick was added to the night. Some players have that demogogue effect--to really wire you up--but not our guys. We react with a ""Ahh, I love Peyton"" or a ""Tony's the MAN"" but then just go about our business. It's the kind of players INDY fans dream of having. Even Bob Sanders, our ruthless daredevil safety, has a kind attitude about him!

What's next to cheer for?  Golf?  Basketball?  Happy but sad...but at least emotion"

"event","At school today, I had a free moment (la vie est belle as a sub) to surf the net for some news and sports. I came across the msnbc site and a link to the Top 10 SuperBowl commercials of all time. You can certainly watch all of them on their site, or click here to watch my favorite, a monkey and two nimwits clapping to the cha-cha: http://www.superbowl-ads.com/2007/index.html. Make sure you click on year 2000 from the menu bar at the top of the site, then it's the middle one of the ""Top 3.

Had a phone interview yesterday with a tour agency out of Boston called EF Tours.  The position was a phone sales job--boring--so I talked myself into passing my resume back to HR for positions in Language School Administration or Youth Exchange Management. We'll see, but it was good to take a stand on my beliefs for a job (and talk trash about the Patriots over the phone--probably didn't help my pitch).

Other than that--things are stable for the second week in a row.  Been running in this cold weather, been subbing, and been tutoring."

However, my other web ""appearances"" such as this page, <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/runtiger23"">www.geocities.com/runtiger23</a>, and my newest blog ""Jocular Commentary"" <a href=""http://jeffcochran.blogspot.com"">http://jeffcochran.blogspot.com</a>, has yet to achieve cyberspace popularity. That's what makes companies like Google and Yahoo! so lucrative--everyone wants to ""buy"" his way to the front page. Same here, except I really don't have a business nor much to say yet ;).<br /><br />Subbing was good today.&nbsp;I replaced Mrs. Gerardot's math class at Carmel High School. When I greet students, I try to keep my introduction as brief as possible, but more students are recognizing me from previous jobs. Most common is French class, although math and gym are a close second and third. Last year I was tagged with the ""Kevin's older brother"" but seems the gap is&nbsp;widening and his reputation diminishing.<br /><br />During the breaks I read more in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<u>Please Understand Me</u> book by David Keirsey.&nbsp; I am torn between two personalities--the Composer and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Counselor.&nbsp;Not like this&nbsp;psychology has the&nbsp;<strong>exact</strong>&nbsp;answers to life's variation, but its quite reputable and surprisingly accurate (to my experience).&nbsp;<br /><br />My knees are a bit sore so I didn't run after school.&nbsp; No sweat though--I'm only doing a 1/2 marathon now on April 15th in St. Louis.&nbsp;I am applying the money I raised for leukemia research last year toward this race instead of the 100-mile bike ride around Lake Tahoe I was supposed to do last year.

"event","While waiting for my flight to board this weekend, I read an article in ""Business Week"" that highlighted the successes of the TOP 25 entrepreneurs in America.  One particular guy (don't remember his claim to fame) stressed the importance of an online journal, such as this one.  He said that not only does it allow you to record your thoughts and share with friends, you can make money off it!  He rakes in about $3000 a month and donates all proceeds to his favorite charity.

So, out of public demand and personal obligation, I am back to chime in with a few remarks from this weekend.  I took a CHEAP flight ($180 round trip) to San Francisco for the weekend.  I stayed with Kara, my partner from DuVine last summer.  She is a good friend (no more sadly) and was a great host (tis what I love most about her!).  We visited downtown, hit the bar scene, strolled Napa and Sonoma wine countries, and dined well.  My favorite part was Sunday night, when the invitation for a drink at her grandparent's house extended into appetizers and dinner.  I learned much about the area, the history of the Allen family, and enjoyed an exquisite meal on the house.  It's times like those that you really get to understand an area and its inhabitants.

I also had an opportunity to reflect on my direction in life.  It is evident that my passion for French/romantic language was not a flash in the pan and that I must find ways to fortify my life with its influence.  However, I understand better that I don't have to commit my professional life to it to feel satisfied.  A brief conversation here and there, to conserve my level, would suffice.  

Nonetheless, my vast knowledge of current French culture will not go to waste either!  My latest idea is to become involve in ambassadorship.  Our current Ambassador to France, Craig Stapleton, was a successful businessman and Ambassador to Czech Republic before his debut in 2005.  Ok, so I could do business school and learn how to better connect our two countries.  In fact, it seems that's the only positive relationship we possess--commercial reliance.  I could do that!

Although it is only 8:40pm along the West Coast I never adjusted my clock and I'm pooped.  I was cheated out of three hours of my day--travel!!"

"event","Today was supposed to be a good day.  We had left the clients in great moods the night before--they were so drunk and happy they were ordering Grand Marnier for us as an after dinner cocktail.  Then today went pretty well on the bike.  Some rude countryside wine harvesters cooed at the ladies of my group, but that's the culture.  I lost my clients a couple times, but the recovery was easy.  In all, they made it up the hill, enjoyed themselves thoroughly at the bars/wine tastings, and made it all to dinner on their own.  I did have a brief scare on my extra ride when re-entering Beaune one of my clients about crashed.  I would have killed myself.

Having left my day like this would have been a charm.  But no, I had to go and get mental.  My co-worker was invited at on the town (not me), and it bothered me.  I did finally meet up with her and the clients, but I was too emotional to appreciate the moment.  I don't know what got into me--all I could think of was how left out I could have been.  I guess everyone goes through this feeling but only I exacerbate it.  Long story short, I ended up ditching my colleague in the city to ride my bike home.  I relly shouldn't have because we both were in such a great mood (having have been served wine and pizza), but I just get defensive sometimes.  They called me a ""predictable"" guy and that just tossed me bonkers.  I don't want women or men to predict my move because them I'll be too easy for prey.  I get very obsequious naturally, and when I have no element of surprise, it means women (especially) can play with my mind.  I need to have some element of control.

I'm tired but I want to say that I pray tonight for a new start, forgiveness, and fresh beginnnings."

"event","I love this town! Today I took the chance to visit the Eglise Evangelique de Pentecote, situated just down the road from my apartment.  I am so glad that I went.  I met fantastic people of faith, like Angelique, a middle-aged woman with 3 adolescants and 1 baby (a miracle), who was my liaison to the rest of the small congregation of about 30.  I was able to sing praise songs, all in French, but actually a few I recognized.  I was so charged to hear the familiar strumming pattern of ""Heart of Worship"" and then to sing its direct translation in French!  The other song, ""Better is One Day"" was to a different tune but the chorus would cause any member of JC or OPPC to want to join along.  Finally, I really contected to strangers in French.  I heard them pray aloud, I followed the preacher and his message of hope and love, I shared my story to the eager-listening Bourguignons.

Anyway, the best part of it all is that I introduced myself to the worship leader and I got my foot in the door to play guitar during service next time!!  I'm so psyched to finally strum the ole' guitar once again.  I never realized how much just a little artistic freedom is vital to the balance of my life.  I have been blessed with opportunities to put together a fancy slideshow of pictures during each tour, but now that my computer is dead (it happened yesterday--won't boot), I think I may be relieved of that duty, which means something else has to come along, and it has!  God works in amazing ways.

It's time to get back to reading this French book about wine...think I would have any interest?"

"event","I just read what I posted last night and honestly, I don't remember typing any of it.  I was running on fumes by that point, and should have gone to bed earlier except fumes from red wine are much more potent than those of other alcohols...

...so to continue the synopsis of my last month. I haven't biked in a week, still eating as if training for a marathon, but haven't checked the scale to verify the damage.  Month of July--ZOOMED by just like Floyd Landis last week.  Did any of you watch the Tour de France?  What an amazing comeback victory.  Even the French were impressed.  He's no Lance but he has more humility and class, a testament to his Mennonite upbringing.  I saw, live, 4 stages while working:  Stage 15 to Alpe d'Huez, 17 into Morzine, 18 out of Morzine, and 20 into Paris.

Watching the final stage along the Champs-Elysees was the most interesting.  We pitched a tent next to a parking garage entrance and taped off the boundaries in order to reserve for our clients.  Well, as you can imagine in Paris, people were extremely curious and sometimes downright rude with our simple request to sit around the edges.  One guy was so furious that he contacted the police and next thing you know we are acting like army recruits in front of an officer pleading to be allowed to stay.  Our clients finally did arrive at 2:30 and had 2 hours of ""luxury""--we fed them beers and nuts and gave them space to chill.  However, once the arrival of the rider was announced, the crowd managed to burst its way into our tent.  They were civil people, unlike we anticipated, and all clients had front row seats for the action.  I posted a picture of our tent and its makeshift barricades.

I am quite excited to be back in Carmel at the end of August. Mark your calanders for August 30th and 31st.  Basically I'll be there for Thirsty Thursday before I head off to Rhode Is. for a cousin's wedding.  

Time to relax by the pool and nurse my battle wounds accumulated over the past month.  Ciao!"

"event","Heya folks, bonsoir!!  How are all my blog readers doing?  Just spent the night catching up on e-mails, blogs, letters, etc. when I figured why not add a little literature myself?  I hope you can tolerate my randomness here at 2:24 in the morning but my body just isn't ripe for bed quite right.  I am finally on vacation!!!  I have been on the road for 3 1/2 weeks straight, from as far West as Bordeaux and East as the Swiss Alps.  I can't believe I have spent 3 months here.  It's been a fast-moving blast, every minute sucked up with dining, biking, getting the van repaired, yelling at French police to remove road barriers, and recovering from a bike crash.  It's quite all messed up but loving loving loving it.

Yes Chris, you can text from France and it's super cheap.  Text back sometime!  Other than that I am simply exhausted and ready for a vacation.  I""ll most likely take the train and go up to Brittany where I spent my Teaching assistantship in 03-04.  And I need to get back into shape.  I took a nasty spill during first day of Tour de France trip up in Alpe d'Huez and had to go to the doctor but no broken bones."

"event","Hey troops, sorry it's been a while since I chimed in. Last week's tour went very well. Flavien and I were ""pimpin"" with our customer service skills, and the guests were very satisfied--we nearly scored perfectly in our evaluations. I have grown confident in leading the Burgundy tour, which from experience tells me I need a change. It's ironic how I work so hard to establish routine only to want to replace that comfort with novelty. But, if I'm going to grow as a tour guide, I know that I must jump into new terrain and start over. Kara and I leave for Bordeaux this Tuesday...

Things have been good. I went to the library yesterday and read for about two hours about Burgundian wine, history, and food. Concentration usually isn't available on Saturday afternoons, but I guess the nice 45 minute run earlier that morning (surplus of endorphins or simply burning calories) cracked open an eagerness to learn? I miss not having a nice gym around where I can select from a variety of equipment to exhaust my body. Instead I am reliant on my running shoes and the few moments on tour with the clients when I get to climb hills to get a good workout. How else am I going to make room for French cuisine if I don't burn off the previous 20 meals!

Today I joined up with the girls (Kara and Carolina) at the Beaune Municipal Pool. I barely made it past the receptionist. At most public pools in France, you see, American bathing suits (Bermudas) are forbidden and only Speedos are allowed. Something to do with eliminating tan lines or fear of sneaking in Milky Way bars. So, as you can imagine, I pulled the resourceful Cochran move and simply rolled up the legs toward my crotch of a pair of tight running underwear. Brooks makes it, called ""Runnerwear."" So anyway, I'm glad I thought of it because if not it would have been an ugly sight in my briefs...

In all, enjoying my time here immensely and working on my fantastic four goals."

"event","Today starts another tour--5 people from the US: a couple from NJ, another from TX, and a single acupuncturist from VA.  I'm eager to begin as more food and wine are near!

I woke up this morning to a peaceful apartment and had the chance to journal on paper a bit.  Thought I would share the gist of my reflections...

""There are a few objectives in my life that I believe to be continual goals and not one to strike off a to do list.  They are my four F's to maintaing good form.  One is French language comprehension.  I want to understand French as the locals do, in order to see as they do.  Two is Food & Wine.  Vocabulary, preparation, pairings so that one day I can be a fabulous host.  Three is fitness.  Always thinking about staying in shape because one day I will do the Ironman not necessarily because of its ""supreme athlete"" connotation but rather as a test of discipline and inner-strength.  Lastly, a female companion.  We all desire to care for a significant other, but it takes work and remembering to place her wants and needs at par with one's own.""

Watched the USA tie in its second World Cup match.  How sad it is that the white (USA) had to rely on Italy to score its one and only goal of the match!!  If you didn't see it, a corner kick deflected off an Italian defender and went into his own goal.  He's never going to forget that one ;)."

"event","Recalling the week of vacation:
Friday--finished the paperwork, took the train up to Dijon to visit Flav.  His parents live on the top floor of an office complex/apartment building.  The bottom two floors are bureaucratic offices, and the top two are private residences.  They have a sweet terrace where we sat, drank wine, and chatted.  Took a tour through Dijon in following the ""chouette,"" a series of arrows with the emblem of an owl in the middle.  This owl is located on the corner of a buttress to the Notre Dame cathedral in central Dijon.  The owl is not the original (because of some bad apple maniacs) but still represents a good luck relic.  Similar to Harvard statue in Boston, you make a wish while rubbing its left foot.  Just next door is an alley where the film ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" was partly filmed.  A photo shows where Gerald Depardieu sat in his Cyrano costume.  Also hit some golf balls at the range, but at that point I was running out of steam.  I took my Diablo Menthe to go, headed back to Flav's for a little snack, then hit the train back to Beaune.  My goal was to end the night early, but ironically enough, I got a call from Fi and Caro to meet them at Route 66 for a drink.  By the time we got there, they were finishing up, so we just took a stroll to a pizza place--Chez Jacques--and then retired.

Saturday--Took a good long run (1 hour) to the top of Montagne de Beaune.  Thinking I wasn't going back to Dijon for a while, I said my goodbyes on Friday.  Again, as irony strikes frequently here, I was back with Fi and Caro that evening to hang out in Dijon.  The night was pretty lame, but at least we got to try some good wines and the only proclaimed ""cheese of the poor"" in France--cancoillotte.  

Sunday--Nothing is open on Sundays in France, so I did a whole lot of nothing.  30 minute run, some e-mails, went out to get a kabob that evening.

Monday--went to E. LeClerc, the Wal-mart of France--and bought supplies for the apartment.  Also went to the Wine Museum of Beaune.  Very interesting learning about Burgundy's geography, harvesting traditions, and barrel-making history.  Better still, because I am considered a facilitator of tourism in Beaune, they let me in for free.  Well, I didn't really have to negociate too much--all the tour guides in France must have the same advantage.  But it's pretty sweet that Beaune treats guides as such, but then again next to viticulture, tourism is this city's #2 industry.  

Tuesday--Since the bank was closed Monday (I often forget that, in order to sustain a mere 35-hour work week, business hours are anything but convenient), I took off first thing today to pull out some cash.  Then I bought groceries, looked at the 15th century Hospice de Beaune (Hotel-Dieu), and simply walked around.  Did another long run up the hill, but by now my legs were getting a little warn out.  

Wednesday--The warmest day in Beaune thus far, I had no desire to scorch my skin outside, so I sat my lazy bones inside and gave myself a haircut.  Made it to the grocery store to buy a quiche and salade for dinner, watched Hoosiers before crashing.

Thursday--Finished reading the book on Bordeaux wines today, did some administrative work in preparation for next week's tour, went to sign up for a library membership, but it was closed (no surprise).  Wrote postcards and went to the bank again to withdraw more cash, but this time not to spend but to make change for next week's tour.  I feel like my clock is back on track, eating properly and not hooked on wine, cheese, butter as much.  There's something to be said about keeping a regular diet and exercise.  Took it for granted that's for sure.  Sure once I resume touring I'll be back on the ""high calorie, high alcohol"" diet again, but never again will I have 4 tours in a row.  Carolina came over and dropped off excess food from her picnic today, so my dinner is gourmet tonight!"

Time out, just got a phone call from the Dean of MBA at Monterey Institute of International Studies.  I was just about to finish my second beer of the evening when he introduces himself and asks if this is a good time to talk.  Of course, seeing as I have been much awaiting his call, I agree and we begin our chat.  He goes over the new offer--about $5,000 additional freed funds--and we chat about this new Localization and Translation/Interpretation degree they are offering new this year.  Well, for some reason, I thought some guy by the name of Ernie was calling me on behalf of the Dean, so I proceed to refer to the Dean in third person the entire 10 minute conversation!  I thought I was talking to someone else when in fact I was talking to him!!  I only realized this at the end of the conversation when I daftly ask, ""I'm sorry, what was your name again?""  He goes, ""This is actually the Dean.""  Talk about a foot in the mouth."

"event","Today begins the start of my second tour. Somehow, I got the first one out of the way. It was a doozie. One would expect the remaining to get progressively easier, and I hope that trend happens. I woke up this morning with a uncomfortable feeling, a combination of nerves, excitement, and homesick. Leading tours can be incredibly fun, but I just haven't got there yet. I still have reservations about something, perhaps a frustration with my French or lack of perfect knowledge about the wine. Still, I am learning and, in the long run, that's all that matters. I should be more thankful for the blessings in my life: exquisite food, good health, generous and caring co-workers. I still get my quality alone time--on runs or even in front of the petalon--I just have to make better use of the limited quantity.

We had a lot of fun last week. Kara and I led a group of 7 couples around Burgundy, sometimes with perfect weather and following the itinerary to the 'T', other times having to fly by the seat of our pants rearranging the schedule to accomodate the rain.  In the end, even though we got docked just a bit on our ""punctuality"" score, you'll be happy to know that I was early everyday. It's the dealing with petals and waiting for all the couples to stop their whoopie and come downstairs on time that usually held us up. As with every tour, we made a slideshow to give to our guests, and when I get home we'll get to watch all 12 that I do over the course of the season.

As it looks now, I will be leading 4 consecutive tours from the get go, have a week off, then travel down to Bordeaux region, lead a few tours there, another week off, then it's tour de france, then a mix of Burgundy and Bordeaux until the end of the travel season (middle of October).  My French has improved BIG time. For example, I spent the entire evening last night speaking French with Kara as we watched this festival called the ""24 hours of Beaune.""  Teams dress up their 3 wheeled tandom bikes and do this 1-2 km loop a BUNCH of times. The leaders make about 20 laps per hour, or one lap every 3 minutes. They race all night until 4pm Sunday afternoon, but with the help of their camps, a center stage, and a cornicopia of viewers.

Gotta get some breakfast, do a little prep work, then head off to the train station! The thought leaves me a bit disconcerted.  Jeff likes his leisure time that's for sure."

"event","I'm still up...why?  This ""day"" began actually on Wednesday at 8:30 when Dad and I drove up to Chicago to drop me off at O'Hare.  Now, 40 hours and 3 lengthy naps later, I'm here in Beaune messing with my schedule, computer, Internet--all so I can contact home easier.  I'm quite stoked for next week!  I'll be in charge of 14 people (7 couples), the biggest group to date.  My partner, Kara, is a 23 year old from CA with an excellent French knowledge and organization skills.  We share a similar French experience--both of us did the teaching assistantship after university.  Needless to say, we get along well and will impress the boots right off these world travelers. 

AerLingus is good, but I enjoyed Lufthansa more with its better meals, movie selections, and drink service.  Star Alliance (United, Lufthansa, etc.) is a pretty nice airline conglomerate.  As much as others have praised AerLingus (either from experience or because they work for American Airlines, partnership), I was not particularly impressed with my flights.  I still need to remember to log frequent flyer miles.

Ok, I need to sleep. My back is starting to really speak to me.  It's telling me that it is tired of supporting my over-analyzing head.  More later.  Be sure to check frequently my website www.geocities.com/runtiger23"

"event","A good question was asked to the crowd tonight where I spent my post-work hangout.  ""Why do we got to wear green on St. Patrick's Day?""  After reading a recent news article about the authenticity of shamrocks across the globe, I learned that St. Patrick used the clover to facilitate the belief of the Holy Trinity to the country of Ireland. (He also went on to perform a variety of other miracles that most of us know through childhood fables.) So I imagine green became symbolic of Ireland as soon as he was made patron saint.  

But...there could be other reasons. For example, most of the landscape in Ireland is green. Or, the tint of the ocean is green from the vantage point shared my most drunken Irish telling ""craics"" in the local pub.  Perhaps even the whole leprechan image took supreme rule and designated its sign color as quite sacred to the holiday. Whatever the case, it somehow means having a lot of fun in the only way Irish know how--drinking and dancing.

I'll get to my point here soon. I think what I am insinuating is that I'm glad Americans celebrate St. Patricks Day. Many of our fore-fathers were Irish, and without these immigrants centuries ago, much of what we see today would not exist. George Bush even went as far as to invite the Prime Minister of Ireland to Washington for a luncheon and a parade. My guess is that Bush's agenda is politically-skewed, but still, this is Ireland we're talking about, and it seems to be in good nature.  

For the rest of us, I hope we dedicated at least 5 minutes of our day to research the traditions of St. Patricks Day as celebrated by those who truly are related to the legacy. The holiday is more than just opening a bottle of Jameson or Baileys and doning your favorite green jacket. To my knowledge, St. Patty's Day is about toasting to the God-fearing evagelist who spread Christianity around Ireland in the 5th century and saved thousands of Irish from idolatry and paganism. It's also about remembering the customs of the Celtic who lived during his time, including the dancing, drinking, and singing. It would behoove us all to learn a hymn or two. They are in English, believe it or not!

The day is also valuable because it allows us to see life from the perspective of an Irishman. Work is a bitch, but all is well over a good laugh and a good pint. Not much else to do when the sky is gray and weather chilly but drink. Californians have a bit better alternative, but are they happy? I guess I like knowing it's five o'clock somewhere and when you feel as if the days seem to run together, you step back, put on your favorite green shirt and clogs, and have a laugh."

"event","I guess it is what you get after teaching a while at the junior high level---sick.  All those kids sneezing, couching, spitting, licking, and even picking their noses.  Then they want to give you a high-five, pass you the ball, borrow your pencil, hold their inhalers, etc.  I mean, you gotta be ready with plenty of ammunition in order to battle the onslaught of germs!!  From now on I'm bringing a pocketful of Purel bottles with me as part of MY gym uniform.

Or, I could just let my immune system tough it out.  I think I contracted this bug because a multitude of circumstances had struck simultaneously last weekend.  First, I had been burning the candle at both ends all week.  Training was good, but I messed around probably too much with my new iPod.  I put in over 50 hours at work, including 10 hour days Thursday thru Saturday.  Then there was the fact I went out drinking Saturday night and didn't keep myself hydrated.  That's where it left me Sunday--where the alcohol hits first--the throat.  Now it has escalated into a true cold, but the worst symptom is my voice (or there lack of it).  I'm so lucky to be subbing for a gym class all week too!!!  RIIIIGHT.

Hey, it's all worth it.  Four more classroom days and I'm outta here, off to Monterey, and to stay, well, for a day that is.  What I wouldn't give to just say ""what the hay"" and miss my return flight.  As long as I accumulate enough good wine and sunshine that day, I'll be easily on that flight home.  In fact, unless the school absolutely WOWs me, I'll probably be so eager to get back to IN and resume training that I won't care that I'm leaving the most gorgeous landscape in the US...

Oh yeah, so one more cynical remark.  Wasn't it just yesterday that we could buy Advil Cold 'n Sinus over the counter?  Wasn't it also just yesterday that those dumbasses down in Southern IN kidnapped and killed that little girl because they were high on meth?  Thanks to them, now Pharmacies need to take down your information when you purchase drugs with pseudoephedrine (nasal decongestant).  Of course, I got to bypass the checkout lines and leave Kroger quick, but still, another example how a few rotten bunch ruin it for the rest."

"event","So I'm subbing for a music teacher here at Carmel Middle School.  As usual, it's been a day chock-full of soundtracks and music documentaries.  My seventh and eighth grade general music classes are watching ""Mozart: the Written Biography"" and the sixth grade class ""Sound of Music.""  We had just heard Mary Poppins sing ""Sixteen going on seventeen"" when the bell rang.  As the next class was coming in, the whole British accent resonating in my head, I suddenly was hit with the movie quote, ""Oah, I'm sooo happy!""  Don't remember at all why that particular bite popped in my head, but I was out for a solution.  

So, I asked the first kid who walked in the door if he had heard of it.  Of course, those sixth graders know nothing.  But I was having fun so I asked that he repeat it in a Britist accent (since every American has a level of fascination/mockery for that accent).  He refused.  No sweat, I thought, maybe he didn't understand my request.  I ask again but this time appearing more facetious.  Again, he refused.  I dropped it, but Jeff really never forgets a moment to make a joke.  I got my chance about 5 minutes later when he asked to borrow a stampler.  I said, ""sure, but you need to ask me in a British accent.""  ""AAAHH,"" he exclaimed, ""How did you know I was from England?!?""  Apparently he moved from England when he was in 4th grade.  I had no clue.  I could have ridden that fortuitous situation out to stardom, but...nah."

"event","Man I don't know what is up with this week, but already three of my students with which I normally meet to tutor have stood me up.  It could be either that I did such a great job in filling in the gaps of subject misunderstanding or that I took on some pretty unreliable students.  If tutoring just wasn't such a good bankroll, I'd probably drop them altogether and move on with Runners Forum or Starbucks.  Still, they've been good to me and, when the pressure is on once again, I hope they know who to call.

Tuesday I got the second of three responses I've been anticipating.  I was accepted into the Masters of French Instruction program at IU.  It would be a two year committment, ending with a licence to teach at the high school level. 

I thought I had a lot on my mind about which to journal, but apparently not.  Although my mind is hardly empty, no topics are crucial.  My Team in Training fundraising is slowly coming together.  I think I need to pour more effort into that, but I guess unmotivating when I am not being pushed to work by those I normally tutor."

"event","It's logical that I feel at home in a math class.  For those who know me well, I naturally think in mathmatic  terms.  Ideas are represented on an axis or two, stories are told with a dependance on numbers, and habits are based on quantitative data--all subconsciously, too.  Yet it's ironic that my passion is for language, particularly idiomatic, although a good read or thorough conversation is quite satisfying.  A career in the engineering or data manipulating would be compatible to these skills, but they'd also bore the socks right of my feet.  It's this dichotomous lifestyle that has had me frustrated for years, but particularly since I graduated.  How nice it would be to simply endeavor one or two subjects, instead of the dozens in which I feel I partake.  Then again, having a zest for many flavors of life keeps life fresh and lively.  Although quirky, the cross country graduate assistant nailed it when she conjured up my nickname, ""spice.""  

I went to DePauw last night to watch the French film ""Les Choristes"" as part of the 2006 CARE Film Festival, the rights to view such purchased by my alma mater.  It was an invigorating experience, as is everytime I even temporarily become immersed in a new language.  I wasn't surprised to have not understood everytime--I am still a long way from fluency--but I was proud to have caught a few inaccuracies in the subtitles.  I will continue to work on my second language skills, but here's the big dilemma:  is it so some avail or am I wasting my time on an incessant challenge.  Ever seen the movie ""Good Will Hunting?""  I am reminded of the Harvard professor who employs Matt Damon as his assistant.  He gives Damon very complex problems in hopes that he can learn from Damon's ""gift.""  In the end, he becomes overwhelmed with frustration because nature finally dominates nurture.  I guess I am a believer that perseverance can only get you so far; genetics takes you to the summit.  I really don't want to believe it because I would love to be a great linguist, but if it means I am sacrificing valuable time with my friends, family, other endeavors, then I don't want to pursue it.  Still, if it brings me happiness, why not right?

Earthquakes will shake our world, but it is destiny who truly flips it upside down the moment we least expect it.  I now am a firm believer that not only is this true, but that God has a hand in it.  I've been praying for some time for God to, as Dr. Ziegler suggested, do something amazing and unimaginable to my life.  The last few days have been proof.  I have met some great new friends, stayed out late, been in charge of a French classroom, and seen an amazing Holiday production at Beef & Boards.  I can't even stay up late enough to soak it all in.  Now I must continue to pray to God for energy and clarity, because my mind is so bass-ackward that it is seeing through its feet!  Nevertheless, I encourage all who happened to have stumbled upon this passage to cease all activity and pray for a miracle.  Not to say my life has changed drastically or anything, but it certainly has opened a few doors I thought permenantly closed."

"event","It's what overachievers loathe.  I was called one again the other day, think it was at either at Starbucks or at youth group this weekend.  True, I like to stay busy.  True, I often go beyond-limits in my endeavors.  True, I can be an anal-perfectionist.  But what does this attitude rely on?  Confidence in gut feelings.  And right now, after having read my e-mail tonight, that gut feeling is being stretched like warm gum from the mouth of a bored junior high student.  

The troubling matter is once again germane to my professional development.  I made this huge decision to pursue graduate school, and now I get this job offer to get back into banking.  I don't know why I'm even considering it--I was SO relieved to get out of that industry four months ago.  However, I believe it was about more than just banking.  It was being in an office full of mothers working retail.  It was about being in a sedantary job counting money (which is so freaking dirty!!).  It was knowing your future meant answering phone calls from an angry grandpa about interest rates and bending over for some guy just because his Dad has 1.3 million in your vault.  Sorry, I don't swing like that.  

The job offer has to do with Corporate Banking and is located in the downtown headquarters.  A couple appealing factors there:  I could move downtown and be apart of the ACTION which I have always enjoyed.  I could earn a heck of a lot more than I do now and start for the first time in my life to be less frugal (honestly don't know the feasibility of this one but perhaps listing it will influence its commencement).  I could surround myself in that corporate atmosphere where you wine and dine, cogitate and debate.  

There's a part of me that wants to be elite, another more bourgeois.  I guess I'm still torn between which path I want to travel.  I like having my hands in many jars with limited responsibility.  I like being able to partake in volunteerism and marathons in addition to my jobs.  I very much enjoy having all my needs met in a five mile radius--the less reliance on the car the better for us all!  But I also know I will grow complacent and lose my competitive edge unless I strive for more.

OH when will the day come that I accept what I have?  When will enough be enough?  Ha!  I think guys are just stupid like that and never get it.  Maybe some do it is just they become domesticated and get girlfriends and revert their attention to home-ownership and the stock market.  Dang, I think I just answered my own question!  I've got a few years left of crazy French/marathon/many small job pursuits.  Let me satisfy that urge before I take on another 9 to 5 job.  They will always be there--an opportunity to study in France and become a professor may not.

See, second guesses are almost always wrong."

1.  No better excuse to buy an extra large chocolate chip cookie for desert--keeps up with the rest of the sugar-loaded population.  
2.  Students ask you out to go Trick-or-treating with them (I taught 7th grade today).  It just breaks my heart that I had to switch the subject and tell them to go sit down.
3.  Retail store business is deader than a fat, slow ant at a picnic.

7.  By working all night, you avoid having to slow down and swerve around the meandering trick-or-treaters.

"event","What game rewards news-savvy academics with useless knowledge only to be imminently forgotten upon conclusion?  I've already racked my brain thrice in attempt to create a witty title to this entry, and, as you can plainly see, the best I could do is the last question asked in our game of Trivial Pursuit tonight at Reinoelhs.  Nevertheless, it was a great cap to a fun night of board games.  I was happy everyone kept the energy level high past midnight, and the games facilitated entertaining conversation.  I was also happy to make a few good drinks for the girls, as it's not everyday one gets to choose from an array of liqueurs and mixers for that nouvelle, stimulating drink.  That's what I go for--little bit of high quality gustatory pleasure every once in a while.  Of course, one would be remiss if not to mention the high quality pizza that complemented my drink, created by our very own Chef Christine.  

Good times, good fun.  And I have to remember--not everything has to be analyzed.  Hangouts should serve that function.  That's where I go wrong:  I feel the need to scrutinize everything from grocery prices to friendship.  Cost-control is all generally good but a danger when applied to humans.  A couple things could disable this tendency.  One, a companion to whom I could share my thoughts.  The other, more intellectual stimulation throughout the day.  The latter I am trying to achieve by applying to graduate school in French and hope to start next Fall.  To say that either one of these will make me a better ""friend,"" God only knows.  All I want is to treat my friends with the same respect and honesty they deserve, and I don't know if that has occurred lately.

So anyway, tomorrow will be a good day of rest (except ironically for my long 2 hour run, tutor session, laundry, and I""m sure others) to initiate another busy work week.  I so long to dedicate my time to one subject!

P.S.  To finish the story of yesterday.  The poor cheerleader (who yes was skinny but I didn't mean to state that fact as important to the story, it was just a matter of how guys think--physically first) got so worked up over how badly she was doing on her quiz that she essentially made herself sick and subsequently threw up.  I like to say it was my dark, threatening eye that caused her nausea, but honestly, I'm sure these girls exist everywhere.  So strung up on perfection--wait, it that part me?"

Now literally NOBODY buys alcohol.  It's a pretty sad table littered with stale chips and water, and the excitement level reaches no higher than the peanut gallery at a bowling championship.  I must say I left with a slightly disappointed mood, even accounting for my fellow diners.  You see, I feel our gang is becoming dismembered.  We no longer are spending the usual 1 1/2 hours talking, sharing stories, shooting the crap, organizing future social gathering, etc.  We don't even make it until the ""flipping off the lights"" stage of closing.  And then tonight, proving my point, the girls had to wait until the boys left the premises before they could open conversation on a particular topic.  

I'm not pointing fingers nor am I complaining about the lack of connectivity.  It's partly my fault as well.  In fact, I want to apologize to my friends for not being present lately.  I've been towing double my weight at my multiple jobs and have left little time for chatting.  If and when I am around to socialize, I sometimes think I come off a little too sarcastic, chauvinistic, and confrontational when I mean to be receptive, straight-forward, and kind.  I like to play by discussing and debating when others just prefer pleasantries.  Not that others don't already know this, but it doesn't help that the threshold breaks sooner now.  

Still, I would like to think that as all old time friends and christian, we could rely on each other to respect and support each other and our decisions/risks.  I think of each one as a sister or brother, and I hope the regard is mutual.  Even if the circumstance is new or uncomfortable, there should be no fear of mockery or belittling.  We should be able to tell stories of when we are at our worst (red in embarrassment) or our best (gleaming in pride).  It would be such a boost to our group, and I will aim at practicing this as well.

Anyway, I better get to bed so to handle the 13-hour workday ahead of me.  Thanks friends, and please do not hesitate to respond.

Jeff"

"event","Do you remember last night?  The gentle storm bringing a cool breeze through our windows?  No wonder I slept well.  I can't discount the sad fact that I was so tired during church that I about slept past my cue to enter stage for the final song of the Regeneration service.  I needed the sleep--I can't refute that.  However, let's just say the rain was icing on the cake of a good catch-up night of shut-eye.  The problem with rain is that, in Indiana, it begets humidity.  I fell victim to its classic trap; what looks to be an extended duration of overcast mist quickly morphs into a sunny steam room by the time you get your shoes on.  

Though I complain that the weather isn't perfect, the Fall season is the best time to be a LDA (long distance athlete).  Sunlight is still adequately generous, the temperature is mild, nature is showing off its colors, and there's not quite the trail traffic as during the summer.  That's part of the reason I sign up to do a Fall marathon.  Last year it was Columbus, OH and this year it will be Philadelphia.  I ran my first of many long runs last Saturday, a 1h25min out-n-back parcours* along 116th, and subsequently an easy 1hr this morning.  The nice thing about having just trained for the Boston is that the distance comes much more easily than I anticipate.  The legs continue to struggle with the hills--another pitfall to training on cornfields.

More so than strengthing my legs and cardiovascular system, training for a marathon puts me further into a long distance mentality.  For simplicity, I'll define it as being more persistent, patient, and disciplined.  I tend to eat better, sleep better, be less hasty, and resist extraneous physical strain.  It's probably where I should be most of the year, but one salient characteristic prevents me from doing so.  That is...I become a wee bit picky.  Not only do I not want to be on my feet, I find excuses for not getting in the car, putting worth the extra elbow grease, etc.  It's like I need the save that energy for the road.  I'm working on this trait because, let's face it, I am not looking to earn big buckaroos for my studliness.  You can help remind me.  Honestly, I won't be offended if you call me out."

"event","So everyone knows of my frustration with the bank.  I mean come on, what's a guy like me chasing after someone's hard earned dollar?  There are so many other gifts, both intellectual and spiritual, I could be using elsewhere.  However today there was a situation presented that makes working there worth it.

There's this customer, Mary Freeman, with whom I've become friends.  She's a frial 90 years old, legally blind, and about as helpless as they get.  It's too bad that her body has broken down as much as it has because her heart is huge and her sweetness is as apparent as the midday sun.  So, I had no hesitation in accepting her request to stop by after work someday to help sort through her mail (most of which she can't even see to know to toss out).  That was about 2 months ago.  We spent about an hour sorting the piles of mail on her kitchen table and talking about her family (old folks are the best at that aren't they?).  Of course the topic of money, accounts, and interest rates came up (do I LOOK like a banker?), especially since the earned interest is the only supplement to the poor gal's fixed income.  That's where today came in.

Mary called me up Monday wondering if she could trouble me for a ride to Key Bank.  She's been frustrated with the interest rate she was earning and, frankly, so was I.  As a banker, I knew she was getting gypped.  So, the crazy nice guy as I am, I decided to play the role of her ""grandson's friend"" and pay a visit with her to Key.  It was quite fun quizzing the ""Relationship Manager"" who helped us and playing with money I would only dream to have.  Despite my connection with the employee, Mary was completely lost and becoming a bit frustrated at herself for not being able to keep up.  We both noticed it, stopped, and plainly asked her, ""What would you like to do?""  I already knew the answer.  She'd been wanting me to help her out the whole time because she trusts us and would like to simply move the money.  And without giving much of a fight, Key agreed to let the little old lady have her way (smart move).  Honestly, it was in her best interest b/c my bank could give her both the convenience of consolidating her accounts and a much higher interest rate. 

Initially I didn't even regard it as extra deposits for the branch.  However, soon after I returned from dropping Mary off, the only important element of my story that resonated in the ears of my managers was the dollar amount of the new money just received.  Irritated at not being able to convey the essence of my efforts, I soon retreated to my work and finished the day.  I guess a moment of bliss is worth the extra effort, though it was tough to sacrifice my lunch break :).

"event","Call me crazy but has anyone had this driving situation happen to them?  While driving back from Cincinnati this evening, about 10 miles out of the city I noticed a black 2003-4 BMW Z3 behind me.  I was cruising comfortably at 70 mph (no cruise control or anything, just going with the flow of traffic) and making passes as they saw fit.  Fifteen minutes pass and I notice that same BMW behind me!  Couldn't tell if it was a guy or gal, but that's the point--it was like the car was following me.  Sometimes it would be on my tail, other times it would be dragging a good 10 car lengths.  Nonetheless, it was mimicking my traffic moves all the way to Indianapolis--a good hour's worth of driving.  The story gets better...It was time for me to merge onto I-465N and who do you think was right behind me?  Yep, the BMW.  After the ramp onto 465 ended, however, it suddenly dropped off and ran its own course.  I didn't see it the rest of my trip, but it has me pondering its true course.  Part of me wanted to think it was a sign that I need to buy a Z3 or maybe it was going to follow me all the way to my apartment then deliver me a package or even had over the keys?  

Or maybe it just wanted to follow a car in order to keep the driver occupied for the boring 80 miles it is from Cincy to Indy?

On top of this, and an even better element to add to the formula for sauna-like air quality, it stormed fiercely yet shortly so to only boost the humidity, hardly putting a dent in the temperature.  Crazy days like this you have to be thankful for what you have.  I guess that's why I'm writing.  I need to see the words emanated from my fingers and onto the screen, indicating I truly feel this way and therefore can smile at this misfortune.  :(, :|, :}.  It's working!

It was another family-packed weekend, climaxed by Kevin's graduation this afternoon.  Frankly, I'm ready for a vacation.  We all know how getting together with relatives can be.  It's fitting that I move out next weekend.  Another weekend like these past two would be a bit of a stretch.  Of course the distance by which I'll be away will only be 8 minutes, but man I hope it feels like a time zone apart.  

For all those reading that did not go to the Nolan's wedding Saturday, let me tell you how impressed I am with Adam Loyd.  This kid picks up a guitar for the first time, takes a few lessons from an experienced musician, and voila, he performs in front of his sister and hundreds of visitors with ease and mastery.  The jack even finds himself with great pitch and a vibrato!  It's obvious that I am jealous.  I play well, but my voice always comes up weak.  Are some of us simply born with that talent?  I wish I had those skills...channel-surfing skills only gets you so far with the chicks.

Gotta go change out of my fourth shirt today.  Is this my punishment for not going to Camp Friendly?!?"

Perhaps it is because of allergies or even the lack of extreme exercise, either case, just after I eat breakfast and until about I see the first customer, I feel like a grumpy zombie.  Now, at 10am, I feel much more alert and uplifted, but why the period of indolence?  I didn't take my usual shot of OJ--perhaps that's it--good ole vitamin C.

So...last night I finished the last of the second trilogy of Star Wars.  What a nice epic story of good over evil.  The graphics and fight scenes are pretty weak, though considering the era I can appreciate its artistic genius.  Mikey came over to watch Return of the Jedi but ended up leaving after only an hour completely disinterested and slighly exascerbated.  Too bad for him--I think these kind of stories are definitely worth knowing.  And even better if you get to experience the tale for only $1.06 per rental!

"event","Start tapping the wood panel in front of you because my next statement is certainly a prelude to a jinx--So far, it's a pretty slow Friday!  Risky, I know, but it gives me an excuse to jot down a few thoughts.

First, I think it would have been interesting if Kevin and I been born with each other's personality.  The stuff he and his friends pull is inconceivable to the tool I was in high school.  Walking out of class early, expelled from prom, throwing parties the day before ""Senior skip day"" which is today.  Sure they're good kids and having a good, safe time, but COME ON, having to parallel park at your own house!!!  Of course any ounce of tempered imperative or vehement emotion directed at these kids is as influential as the wind of the three little pigs.  The only way I could blow the house down on that party is to beat them at their own game, but unfortunately I don't even know the rules to ""Texas Hold 'em?""

Second, work.  Finding a way to enjoy it isn't too difficult, however, there's that minor detail called ""personal ambition"" that always gets in the way.  Well, at least for me it does.  If I just didn't have a personality that craves novelty and diversity, perhaps you wouldn't read me bitching about it as much.  I found a new FT employment though, and I hope it provides me the satisfaction I've been looking for.

Lastly, and thanks to Katie Haugk, I remembered the synonym for a dehydrating agent: a diuretic.  At first I needed it in order to look smart while describing to Jeremy, Gretchen and Mom at dinner Wednesday night why putting salt in your beer makes you drunk faster.  If you want to know the biology behind the matter, just ask your local doctor, or you can ask me, but I'd like you to address me as doctor, too.

Well I've managed to dodge the crowds and the jinx so far this morning, and honestly, I hope the trend continues until closing time.  I see we have our next interviewee for FT teller waiting for our manager--another new face to learn.  For those who were at Don Pablos last night, I can't call this one ""hot, new girl"" but merely ""new girl"" though more appropriately ""new grandma.""  Oh I need to get out more."

"event","Title was true on so many obscure levels of life, it almost lost its humor yesterday.  It started when we discovered that one of the computers on the teller line wasn't booting correctly because its hard drive was not communicating with the CPU.  We had to call the NCB helpline, and after only a short diagnosis, we determined it was fried and needed to be replaced.  Next were the florescant lights.  Fortunately we had already planned for a maintenance guy to come out this day and replace the bulbs, but it seemed as if he spent all day working on them.  And at last, it was our customers.  My sweet Lord, how they had their issues!  Did the world crash for everyone else last weekend or just those who bank at 21 North Rangeline Rd?  Sure I don't mind answering calls every half hour or so, but every few minutes, particularly when the majority of questions don't even pertain to this branch, that's simply ludicrous.  I would have to laugh to myself, however, because I think customers find it rude if a banker laughs.  Bankers wear ties everyday to work so to prevent their largnyx from accidentally shifting to a position condusive to loud noises or unnecessary murmurs.  Laughing would be out of the question, even if the answer to your customer's question is, ""well do you even know what your PIN is?""

"event","Wowzer.  What a weekend.  What a WEEK.  I just took my first shower of the day, this 18th of April, a day where I was not able to finish a race I started.  The Boston Marathon was a defiant adversary, whose expertise and elemental magic certainly beat the living socks out of me.  The 109-year old Goliath used hills, wind, temperature, and sun to create a condition unlike any previous race in which I have ever participated.  It was unseasonably warm (70), cloudless, trade winds from the east, and downhill for the first 16 miles (which you would think would be nice but let me tell you it pounds on your back and calves).  Add that to the fact I was slightly ill last night due to a headache and chills--odds weren't in my favor.  However, like a fearless warrior, I drew up the best strategy I could and headed for the battlefield unperturbed and confident.  Now that I am done I think back and can draw up more ""what ifs"" and ""if onlys"" than could I a decent strategy.  Perhaps that's the core of my journal entry--have I just experienced my first true failure at setting a long term goal and not completing it?  Have I much more to learn about playing the odds?  Sure do.

I'd be an idiot to think I'm the only one to whom this has happened; in fact, there were three guys on my medical bus who fell into the same trap!  Nonetheless, it has been hard for me to swallow my pride and admit I simply screwed up.  Perhaps it was really due to the choices I made in diet, sleep, training, and others that brought on the ""bug"" I contracted last weekend?  Thinking more about it, I think I did try TOO hard to be in perfect shape for this marathon.  Next time I'll know better than to be so picky.

Not only did I see the finish of three long hard months of training, this weekend I was able to clear my head and refocus my perspective on career/living arrangements.  I used it as an excuse to consider moving into a loan officer position at another branch of National City, essentially delaying the inevitable.  However, something struck me as I was lying in the medical tent this afternoon:  I totally respected those docs/nurses!  Man how cool it would be to have been in their shoes, to examine patients and help them simply regain inner strength by providing support, encouragement, nourishment.  They get my applause and a standing ovation.  

One other thing:  I met a nice couple from Quebec while at the Fitness Expo Sunday.  They were speaking in both French and English to each other, switching back and forth to a rhythm God only knows.  My first point:  If I'm going to raise a multi-lingual family, I gotta find a spouse that wants to do the same.  Secondly, If I'm going to get serious about French, I gotta move to a French-speaking area, and soon.  Lastly, and I was not surprised to hear it, but Quebecois definitely distinguishes itself from Parisian French.  To live there and speak only French would be a step backwards at first for me.

Well that's probably enough of my blogging for one night.  My prayer is for all the runners to have safe recoveries and that I make it back to Boston again one day for a rematch."

"event","The impossible has happened--I decided to stay home from Thirsty Thursday.  The ceiling was coming down in bits and pieces while the clock somberly ticked passed 9:15 (the time I normally get my marguerita), but it was worth it.  I had been falling asleep all day, and it didn't matter what I was doing: while opening accounts, at dinner, at Charlie's house for guys Bible Study.  I think it was the combination of a good hard morning run plus not getting a whole lot of sleep the previous nights.  At any rate, this morning I woke up after a continuous 8 1/2 hours of sleep.  Ironically I'll probably be sluggish at work, but c'est la vie!

We talked about a very good subject at our Bible study last night.  The topic pertained to the taming of the tongue.  How true it is that our tongue is like a rudder on a ship--such a small component in charge of steering its larger counterpart.  Yet it is so hard to control because only a PERFECT man can live so that only good, wholesome words come out.  Nevertheless, the tongue is the first place the signs of temptation show.  If we can work on keeping that area clean, we can more easily connect with the goodness that lives inside of each of us.

In other news, I think the IRS is auditing me.  I got a call while at work yesterday from a very frank and quite impersonal gal in Kansas City who demanded I send my W2s to her by fax immediately.  Ok, so I forgot to send in my W2s with my return, but come on, I'm a first time filer (on my own that is).  Secondly, those who do it online don't have to send in a copy of their W2s, so I understand why so inconsistent?  I hope you won't be reading my live journal written from jail!

Well, it's time for work.  Ugh.  I didn't realize that Carmel High School is giving the students the day off/Spring Break started yesterday!  Sure had me fooled.  We sure didn't have that luxury.  I guess more schooling in Hamilton county are doing this, as if it takes an EXTRA day for everyone to pack and prepare for their trips.  Think I could pull off an April Fools day by calling in sick then arriving to work 5 minutes before the bank opens?  That would be cool...but who am I kidding, really.

Have an awesome weekend--here here for 60s!

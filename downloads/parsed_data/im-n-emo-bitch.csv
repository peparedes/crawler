"event","i'm grounded because i called england 38 times and my dad checked his email and they said he owed him like 1, 999 dollars or something like that. He called SBC and then, my dad found out i called england 38 times and i owed him alot of money. At first, my dad wanted me to get a job, pay it off and then i move to hawaii cuz he's sick of paying stuff  and then he was on the phone with sbc and they reduced the bill alot. So i might just have to pay 45 dollars, but i dont know. i might have to pay the whole thing. so i learned my lesson. im grounded for a week. no internet, no phone unless i have to call my dad or mom or grandma. i dont know if friends count so i guess i'll talk to everyone at school. see you all later. oh and Ann...  we still get to go see HIM!!!!! yay!!! lol... ok..im done bye"

if i could i would wish upon a star and wish to be yours
but i know its impossible.
just give me my old life back
if i could...i wouldnt have to write this poem bout you and all the feelings i am holding in
but just wait and you'll see

ALL YOU GUYS CARE BOUT IS HOW HE TREATED AMIT AND STEPHANIE AND SO WHAT!!!!!! i got over it and so can you guys and if going out with chrisitan makes you hate me..then fine. go ahead and hate me. you just lost a great friend and i tried to hide this from you guys, cuz i knew how everyone was gonna react and i didn't let that stop me from making this descisson. why stop something that i know is gonna make me happy?!!! and if you guys can't forgive me and just let me be happy and shit..then i guess you guys aren't my friends and can't support me on this. and for those who do support me..i thank u so much!!!! i love you guys!!!!!!

All day i cleaned my room cuz i wanna see all my old friends from Torrance so i cleaned..and  then my parents came home and were surprised i cleaned and i can go to torrance thank god!!!! but my stepmom wants me to water the lawn and i dont feel like it. i am worn out!!!!!!! i wasn't even down cleaning and i just sat down to take a breath and almost feel asleep and now they want me to go outside and water the lawn...the lawn can wait til 8am tomorrow. i dont care..i'm not going outside right now and water. hell no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! tomorrow should be a bad day cuz tomorrow will be one year since i told MR.  ANDREW RUSK that i liked him and then i feel in love with him, but wutever...screw him!!!!!!!!!!!! but tomorrow won't be bad cuz at 1:15 i am going with brittani  to see a movie and eat food and like hang out..yay!!! woot woot...yea..so i should have fun. And i am thinking that i should give up on Dan.  Think bout it.....he's going into the 11th grade, almost a senior, he plays football and is popular.!!!!!! he won't like me, and Stefanie M. thinks its not a good idea to call him over the summer cuz he might think its werid how i got his number but i thought just to tell him i found it in the directory but she thinks he would be like werid bout it.  so scratch out calling, which means there is no way to see him, unless i go to the skool and like watch him practice but then again, thats to werid. and then i have to wait til skool starts and then again..we might not have any classes together..so its pointless to like him if i can't talk to him, but then again..im afraid i won't like him and find out he liked me. Then its like i missed out on something. Fucking sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!"

reason for this...yesterday in bio, people were doing there oral reports. Dan and his friend are the last group to do it. Dan is behind me giving out his outline cuz the teacher is stupid and wants everyone to have an outline. He is behind me for the longest time. im like freaking out, well not in front of him but like inside. i wanted to say oh..thanks. kinda talk alittle before his report, but then i thought it sounded to stupid and yea...so i didnt even bother to say thanks. just looked away and then the teacher did role,called his name and the way he said here and i like almost melted. and before the bell rang, Dan was waiting near the door and im like standing there and ann text me saying  like how steven spellman might come with us to see system of the down, and i like freak out and like jump and Dan stares at me and i'm like laughing. thinking wut a dork i am. The bell rings and Dan walks out, then this person, then me and Dan and i are walking side by side, im kinda behind. Freaking out..and hes like giving everyone highfives and im like omg!!! ur so awsome!!!! but it sucks so much!! and tomorrow i have to give my report infront of him!!!!!! cuz last class we didnt have time!!!!! ahhhh!!!!!!

You<br>long to be able to reach out and tell someone<br>everything, and all of your problems... But you<br>have no one to tell, or they just don't seem to<br>want to hear what you have to say. You've been<br>hurt many times that you don't seem to have any<br>tears left to shed, or if you do, they're an<br>endless river flowing... You've started to hide<br>and bottle up all or your problems and<br>feelings, hoping that maybe they just will go<br>away... You want company, but at the same time,<br>you're scared of it. Your sanctuary is your<br>room where you can just be alone and try to<br>throw away all of your aching pains. You're<br>dark and mysterious and people like you for<br>that reason. Even if you think you're all by<br>yourself in the dark, someone is always there<br>with you. Your special someone wants to admit<br>and show their feelings towards you, but<br>they're afraid of how you'll take it. Get out<br>more and enjoy life because, it is far too long<br>to frown your way through :)

"event","the whole food thing is not the reason why im mad at some of you and i don't think im the only one with problems. Sometimes i feel left out..like the whole you guys fliming a movie last weekend....everyone was in it, but me...i don't know that much bout wut happend staurday but do you how like that made me feel and then that time at the bmx thing. How you guys were like omg..krystal likes that guy...wait..how bout that guy?!!!! i mean..yea it was funny, but sometimes thats wut i think you guys see me as...this girl whose tottally boycrazy and sometimes i have to scream at the top of my lungs that i'm not that wild, boycrazy girl i was last year.i am srry i take everything so seriously, but since i was in kindergarten or 1st grade, i have been made fun of ALOT!!!!!!! i can't talk to my dad, because he doesn't help. All he says well.. you know Jennifer and i and layla love you very much and then he acts like nothing happened and i remind him sometimes..remember when we had this talk...he won't remember and i explain and he still doesn't remember..so why bother with him and stephanie... i know you said at least i have a dad and yea, but most of my life, i didn't. in fact, i didn't feel like i had parents. My dad lived either in malibu or calabasas and my mom was drunk and smoked and couldn't raise me and she thought moving to torrance with my grandparents when i was going into the second grade would solve her problems. so i left in second grade leaving you and alot of my friends behind and some don't remember me and i barley saw my dad...sometimes it was like a 5 minute vist and that was it. My mom got sick of living with my grandparents so she moved like 20-30 minutes or sometimes an hour or 2 away leaving me with my grandparnets.  My mom lived in the hotel most of the time i lived in torrance. i was being raised by my grandparents telling me that i need to be this way or that way and i wasn't excepted as me and i love my cousins but sometimes i felt like i wasn't loved by them either. i was like the only ""fat"" person in my family out of all my cousins and anyone saw me...they would say, Krystal..have u lost weight!! keep it up!!! it might not be a big deal to you guys, but i was never loved as a child and well.. my friends in torrance...well...some of them were the best but i didn't really have friends that care bout me the way sam and stephanie and everyone has. Alot of people care bout them, and i know you guys care, its just ..i don't know.. i can't explain it. Its just that im judge more then any of you. You take one look at me before you get to know me and when you think you know me, you don't."

He will buy layla something or my stepmom or himself, but when it comes to me, i usually don't get anything. so..when i have money or a lunch... im a bitch bout it cuz i try to eat alot at skool before i go home cuz i know my dad and he sometimes....how do i put this... starves me, which doesnt explain why i am fat, but wutever. sometimes i would be hungry cuz well.. no lunch at school, no breakfast so i come home straving and then i eat one little thing, and my dad flips out and tells me i ate to much and like yells at me if i eat more,, i'll gain weight and for the past 3 days, i haven't been really eating. i eat like 1 meal..everyday for the past 3 days or something. it just hit me yesterday that i don't need you guys like being this way  to me. I really don't need this. I am already mad at my parents and shit and i just dont need this from my friends. i am srry for those of you who are in the group and arent even part of that whole fucking shit they do, but i just can't stand being there anymore  pretending to laugh about it and feel like shit inside when i already feel like shit. you think i would have my friends there for me when im upset, but i don't. its bad enough i don't have my parents there for me, but now my friends and you think you guys who are my true friends and i complain bout stuff would realize how upset i am, but wutever. Yesterday..when you guys were busy doing this shit to me and making me more angry, my dad got wango tango tickets from his friend and i have been wanting to go since i was like 10 or wutever and it turns out my dad keeps talking bout how hes going and i am not even allowed to go..and shit. He won't buy me a ticket and he wont do anything!!! so..my life is fucked up!! go me!!!!!!!! and now im starting to think dan doesn't like me, and he found out i like him and he just doesnt like me back.. i should be used to this, but i am not."

"event","My life doesn't seem to be getting better. My grandparents left yesterday and my aunt left tonight...thank god!! i couldn't deal with them. there one reason why i have been so like ugh!!! My stepgrandma or wutever the fuck she is thinks im fat cuz sunday i was eating tons of cookies  and i was depressed that day, i mean i was in the shower for like the fucking longest ass time and crying and i come out, my eyes are all red and noone seems to want to know why?!!!!!! My whole family didn't give a shit. so im sitting there eating cookies and my grandma was like krystal... lets do this contest to see who can lose the most weight cuz we all need to. Fuckin asshole!!!!! i am skinny then you bitch!!!!!! They  care more bout layla and my dad and jennifer more then bout me. They bought my dad and jennifer like everything. a couch(well thats coming someday), a tv and dj speakers. they gave layla a puppet and they worried bout her cuz she is sick. When im sick, its more like oh..shes faking it..yada...yada. assholes!!!! i get a lamp and a top. I haven't seen them in a decade and they buy the parents who dont even do a fucking shit stuff and i do everything in this whole fucking house, plus homework,plus watching  layla, and still havin my own life and i get 90 bucks to get a lamp and a top and while thats going on.. im the fattest person in my family!!!!! I am like nothing and my dad is basically using me to watch layla. He and my aunt made fun of me and said something like i should go to finishing skool. I am now known as the daughter of the 1st marriage. Not the daughter anymore... just the daughter of the 1st marriage and i get this feeling i am a mistake. My mom and dad were young when they had me..23 or 24 years old and i guess they werent ready. they knew they had a kid on the way and they got married and a divorce when i was 2. My dad was never there for me when i was little. Always late for things... he didn't even come to my 5th grade graduation.  He didn't see the whole thing. He missed alot of my softball games and he didnt even come to that award thingy in 5th grade. Now, hes like being a better father to layla then me. He's taking her to preschool and soccer and basketball and cares if shes sick. its like im not wanted. He talks on his cell but at least hes there.  Layla seriously doesn't know how many people love her. Shes this fucking skinny little girl who everyone loves and i am just nothing!!!!!!!!! i understand why my mom wasn't there for some parts of my life, but she always tried but my dad like didn't give a shit. My mom was smoking and drinking and couldn't really raise me but now shes done with that shit and trying harder to be a better mom, but my dad just hasn't changed and i live with my dad...so you do the math... more pain.  i think this explains why im so boycrazy...well used to be. think bout it.. i wasn't really loved when i was younger and i have done stupid things when i was little and i wish i could take those things  back. i just wish i wasn't born. i wonder wut things would be like if i wasn't here, but we will never know now..will we!!!!"

"event","This week has sucked alot!!!! My grandparents are here from florida. I  can't do anything. i haven't been online in so long or done anything. just go to skool and back and hang out with them. it sucks!!!! i feel like i can't have fun and if i ask, i have a feeling my dad will say no. so i dont even bother.  yea..anyways.. i am worried about some of my friends.  They are depressed, but to hear this and look at them and be like no way!!!!  i mean..they sometimes aren't depressed or they are and hide it good and i wish they would talk to me. i don't want to hear they killed  themselves and i know they aren't me and would try, but i just don't want to hear that  happened. i am trying to be a better friend. not care so much bout me and focus more on my friends cuz without you guys, i would probably be dead now. seriously!!!! i know my reasons were stupid for wanting to die, but to me at the time it was a perfect reason. Now i don't really want to die. infact, i kinda think life just began. i think the news bout the girl from a.e.wright hit me. She lived to be in 8th grade and hung herself and i wish i could of helped her with anything. i wonder why she didn't have friends like i do.  i know it sounds stupid, but wutever. i think highschool has changed everyone. think bout it. we used to be really good friends, never talked bout how much we hate someone behind there backs and now all of a sudden we changed, became something, which i don't know but something we never thought we would be. why can't we go back to middle school?!!! wutever.... anyways... i found this pic of me when i was like 10 or 11 or something and omg!!! i was so fucking skinny!! now that i look at myself, i wonder what the fuck made me become fat!!! and why when i was little, my grandparents were telling me i wasn't perfect and yea..and when i look at the pic.... i see someone different. i see the old me!!! the old not  emo skinny krystal. i gotta show you all!!!  you wont believe it!!!  Even Ann was like shocked, but i will never be that again. i am stuck being fat!!!!!!!! Maybe if i was that skinny, Dan would be mine!!! but it won't happen....."

"event","i don't know what to do!!!! I keep hearing that Dan is a asshole!! i don't think he is and its been bothering me all day!!!! i want to tell him i like him so bad, but i am thinking its not a good idea. you know, to many bad experiences with telling guys. Alot of people say to get to know him better, which i am planning on to, but its hard when he's walking with all of his cool friends and theres me.. The FAT AND UGLY KRYSTAL!!! Some people in bio think he is an asshole cuz well..i think this is the reason.. on friday, he and this girl who used to be like best friends were like fighting. He said something really mean and she said somethings mean... kinda dont know and all of a sudden you heard Fuck you!!! from her!!! She went to the office crying and never came back. He went to the office and came back but had to go back. Today, i found out she got sespended cuz she punched him and he didn't fight back!!! just used words!! She is coming back tomorrow!! but i am so proud of him!!! using words instead of fighting!!! i just don't see why everyone thinks he is an asshole!!! and then i also found out that he drinks, which is like a bad thing, like i don't mind, but i don't wanna talk to him and he totally forgets who the fuck i am!!! or wut if he actually likes me and like ask me out, but he forgets!!!!! i know.. forget about him..thats wut you all are gonna say..well i can't!!!!! i like him to much!!! ugh!! i hate this!! anyways...star testing week!! yay!! fun!!! go me!!! jackie and i are in the same room!!! yes!! go us!!! lol..and my grandpa and whoever she is and my aunt and maybe uncle are coming...well..grandpa is coming on wednesday. a bunch of cleaning going on. yay!! so life sucks!! yay!!"

"event","ok.. here are the lyrics to me and jackies song that we dance to in dance....lol.

Do you feel this, i know you feel this
Are you ready, i don't think so

somebody get me my truck, so i can ride on the clouds
so we can turn up the bass like
somebody pass my guitar, so i can look like a star
and we can spend this cash like
what you gonna do when the crowd goes ayo
why ya'll standin on the wall
music's fallin everywhere, so why don't you just move along

I see you lookin at me, like i'm some kinda freak
get up out of your seat, why don't ya do somethin
i see you lookin at me like i got what ya need
get up out of your seat, why don't ya do somethin'

Now ya all in my grill, 'cause i say what i feel
Only rock to what's to real, now ya wanna bump bump
But Brookly do that wit you, only here wit my crew
We can roll if you can, don't be a punk punk
What ya gonna do when the crowd goes ayo
Why ya'll standin on the wall
music's fallin everywhere, so why don't you just move along

Chorus * 2

See you lookin over here, can't you tell i'm havin fun
If you know like i know, you would stop
Starin at us and get your own space
And do somethin'

Chorus"

They didn't have my pics on friday so i went there staurday. i was calm and when i saw him... i went crazy!!! AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! i swear he was like wut the fuck?!!!!!! and all i could was watch him cuz at the time they were trying to find my pics, which turned out they dont deliever on weekends. so fucked up!!! I was watching him  and he was like being so nice and i was like why is he so nice to people he doesnt know or to his friends, but when it comes to someone who loves him so much, he is an ass..and then i was like oh..yea.. i am the cause of us not being friends. ugh!! me and my big mouth!!!!!!!!!! and today, i like almost bumped into him.  i was walking with  Marlin, Sean (some guy i dont know), and Christian. i couldn't find anyone..so i was walking with them to the assembly that like made me cry. it was about how people die in car crashes due to drugs and drinking. anyways.. i was like following them and Andrew comes and i don't know but like i almost bumped into him and i got this really hurtish/sad/something feeling in me and then like i try to ignore the fact hes there and yea..and i am talking to marlin and then i turn around and see Dan like kinda near Andrew and i was like oh god!!!!!!!!! great!!! i think someone should just throw a brick on my head!!!!! that would be fun!!!! wutever... this is my pathetic life.

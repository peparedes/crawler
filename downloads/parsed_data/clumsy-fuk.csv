"event","Well mum ""wrote"" me into sense 2day....c cnt say tlkd bcoz meh i cnt hear her:( but she very much mde me c sum sense in my mixd feelins/emotions tht iv had lately. Infact she mde 2 much sense, wish i culd hav realisd al b4 hand..bt thts me 4 u. But howeva much tht mkes me happy i feel nt gud at al at the momnt bt tht dnt mata!!

U kno its hard i kp thnkn of doin thngs tht seem nrml an i thnk bout doin thm and thn realise i cnt ie. pik up the fne and ring ppl....and it always sort of brings reality hittn hme. Bt i mean im thnkful 4 wat iv gt, evn tho i kno its hard its beta thn nufin, and evn tho it wnt last 4 eva its stl beta thn nufin rite...so thts sumthn 2 b happy bout. Its jst tryna adjust its rather a tad hard espiecally wen i shut myslf off compltly frm every1 and wifhold my feelins. Everyday is hard and painful in every way bt at the end of the day i kno i hav 2 mke the mst of wat iv gt coz life is 2 damn short 2 jst sit bak and waste away coz thngs r a lil tough. So im nt gona im gona mke the mst of wat iv gt and do the best i cn no mata wat each day brings!!!:D

I found out 2day of a certain 2 ppl tht nw hate me bcoz 1 of the 2 has being spreadn lies and shit bout me tht the other 1 has believd and caused thm 2 bth hate me and 4 me 2 cum 2 the conclusion tht 1 of thm is pritty damn crazy 2 mke up tht sorta shit....if any of tht mkes sense...but u c the hate thng is nt so bad i thnk it is actually a gud aspect here bcoz i no lnga hav 2 forcefully devote myslf 2 ppl who dnt kno wen sum1 is tryna gt lose frm thm. They hav finally gne lose frm me whch is great in many ways!! I felt 2 mean telln thm straight up i didnt wanna b around thm and the reasons why bt it seems theyve dne it 4 me and at the same time mde up a fantasy land bout me!!:D Oh dnt i feel special:P Bt c i lk at ths as very much a plus! But the ppl who actually kno me hav stuck by me and its a gud thng reali it shos u who realli is ur frend or who realli doesnt cre bout u and tht cn b a gud thng rite?? :S

Anyway i thnk i need a few hrs slp nt being a great day 2day."

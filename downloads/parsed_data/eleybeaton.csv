burn me down if that's how everything's gonna start
with a flame from the heat off the look on your face
on a day like today
i could have made out every raindrop falling down
on your head 
now I fear that I may taste
these tears rolling down my face
and realize something is wrong
with the light of the sun
in the color of the sky
with you and everyone...."

i had this weird dream yesterday morning, the scene is a small L-shaped kitchen kind of european type with a wooden table on the center around it is karl lagerfeld wearing a black coat and white shirt with a black tie and a cowboy's chaps.. so every time he raises or stretches his arms his suit is rising up and i can see part of his creased legs peaking (lol).. also in the scene is carine roitfeld (editor of french vogue) wearing a pistachio and black striped mini-dress with black stilettos (soo not her), amanda harlech (karl lagerfeld's muse) wearing a black dress, a french guy and jujiin <lj user=""philandlil"">... we're planning daw to go to inez van lamsweerde's (photographer) rest house for a tea party but karl doesn't want to leave because carine might steal his brown spherical shaped soap sitting on the sink... that's the only thing i can recall.."

"event","Set one year after BR1, the two surviving students from the previous year's bloodbath, Shuya Nanahara (Fujiwara) and Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) return home, their lives permanently scarred by the terrifying experiences of BR1. Around them, the Battle Royale act continues and another class is kidnapped and placed in a Battle Royale. After the previous incidents, the public becomes aware of what the Japanese government is doing to their children and riots break out, some people violently attacking Japanese politicians in the street. Democracy no longer exists in this Japan where the country is dictated by the Japanese military who came away from World War II victorious alongside Germany. The rioters are violently dealt with and their children are thrown in to Battle Royale along with the randomly selected tenth grade class of boys and girls.......


......Too bad the director Kinji Fukasaku lost his battle with prostate cancer and died during the production of Battle Royale II. His son, Kenta Fukasaku, co-director and scriptwriter of Battle Royale I and II has taken his place in directing the sequel to Battle Royale."

i dunno why. 

today 
+ my i.d. was officially confiscated for wearing a long-fucking-hair.
+ i didn't attend class because i have to get a temporary i.d. from SAO. (students something org.i forgot)
+ a concerned friend texted me that i changed na daw, in a negative way, that i have to be sensitive with my surroundings. 
+ i went to our office to finish some paper works.
+ ariel and i had a meeting with thelma sioson-san juan, the general manager of abs-cbn publishing to finish the proposal and the costings for our upcoming show this feb.
+ dropped ariel at sequia apartment to meet-up with neil oshima.
+ went home. very tired.
+ chatted with several friends online while listening to jp's rants and raves with his 5th <small>blowjob</small>. =P
+ jp told me i look so worried. 
+ had dinner with jp at jollibee. i had champ, fries and coke. hehe. yummm. sobrang busog. 
+ jp went home
+ while walking towards the elevator. i saw this semi-cute small boy with a big bag, just got out of the elevator, stared at me.. while waiting for the lift, i look back, he's still there, few meters away, trying to make a phone call on a non-signal spot.. so i gave him a ""will-you-stop-posing-there-and-follow-me"" look, so he went back, just followed me. he looks pretty decent naman, so i'm not that worried. when i'm about to open my door. i greeted him. he said hi.
me: u live here?
him: nah. i just visited a friend
me: what floor?
him: 20th
me: okay. see you around. 
+ then i went inside, semi closed the door. grab a drink. then look again outside. he's near the elevator. then i said; u wanna come over? he said sure.
+ we just had a small talk. some getting-to-know-you type of conversation and as far as i can remember, he's a 23 years old freelance interior designer slash florist from makati. he also showed me his works on his cute laptop, which is not bad at all.. he had to leave early because he have meet <i>daw</i> his clients. ok. we just exchanged numbers. 
+ took a nap for like two hours, feeling down, then i went online again.
+ phoned-up bing just to say hi.

(in my view) just a little misunderstanding. he said things that scathe me too much, like ""i had enough of immaturity. it's time to be realistic and not play games"". its like, in my view, those peaches and butterflies that he's imparting to me is not really from his heart. i just want to have a feeling of having a so-called older brother. am i demanding too much? i told him before i hate like promises, if we can't meet up with our needs, it's fine, mejo matampuhin ako, most of my friends knows that, pero sandali lang yun, mawawala din.. but he insist on doing his optimistic acts. parang, sana sinabi mo na yung asa loob mo before pa, look now, napuno ka na tuloy. i'm sorry and i thank you."

(habang umaarte ng mejo tipsy na)... ayon. dinaan ko lang sa pag inom ng madami. naubos namin ni moki yung binili naming isang bote ng white wine, tapos ilang bottles ng beer, samahan mo pa ng vodka na nainom ko earlier. naubos pera ko dun ah. lapitan nyo ako pag broken hearted saka lasing, nanlilibre ako. nalibre ko si moki ng martini saka si rocky ng beer ng d oras. haheshet.. pero ansaya saya ng tama, laugh-trip with rocky, sass and moki.. pareparehong kasing lasing na rin. kung sino sino pinagtatawanan namin ni rocky, pati si jujiin habang naduduling duling na nakatingin sa strobes ng acquario dahil pumart-e with his noel. mejo nagtampo lang ako kay rem kasi nde ko nakita, pumunta pala. pero ok lang.  nakalimutan ko ng sandali si rowrence, pero wa epek na pag uwi, close to tears pa rin ako.

pag gising ko, morning habit, nag online ako kagad... check ng face-pic, check ng lj, online sa mirc, nakita ko si rowrence, minack ko. sabi ko.....

me: uhm hey, good am

him: and wer liking each other na...
(ouch pucha, nde ko nakeri)
me: ok. 
(cinlose ko yung window nya, dinedma ko na muna, since nag memessage din kasi ako kay melvin sa face-pic)
after few minutes, minack nya naman ako.
him: kaw, mag kwento ka...
me: heto may ginagawang novel sa face-pic, minemessage si melvin. sandali lang. 
him: aahhh

me: thanks nalang.
him: bakit ka nagpapasalamat.
me: la lang, i had fun hanging out with you. 
him: ako din.
him: friends?
me: yeah sure. (ek.)

it's so tiring because we went to different meeting places,  but i'm actually enjoying it, in some ways, like when i met some interesting people...

Your life has no direction. You run around and around and around, passing through many of London's tourist attractions, mainline stations and interchanges: as a result you are often overrun by tourists and accordion players. It takes you an hour to do one 14-mile round trip, passing through 27 stations. You are bright, cosmopolitan, and somewhat jaded, and you like accordion music.

More on Mouse on Mars: 

Mouse on Mars, a German band, is probably one of the more unusual bands you are likely to hear. Alot of their music can be described as harmonized sound effects only cooler. It's definitely way out there, and on top of it the lyrics, which are minimal and not the focus point, are art-philosophy. Crazy, crazy stuff! 
I've only seen the video for Actionist Respoke, but it was really really cool ^_~ They are definitely a great band to watch an interview with, as they are outgoing, interesting, and have the cutest accents you will ever hear."

you really need to die. you've had your share of dishing out insults as well as taking them, in any event, you realize this and realize that ending your misery fast is just too kind, so you pull out some dried underbrush and gasoline and put that shit to flames, i'll give you points for actually going up in smoke, but lets face it, you really did deserve it..."

"event","I don't know what's up with me today.  I've been absolutely miserable for the past five or six hours.  I've been pushing stuff out of my head for so long, and I think it's all finally starting to catch up with me.  What sucks is that I don't have anyone to talk to about it.  Jer is at work, my mom has troubles of her own (and I already talked to her, anyway), I never really talk to any of my friends anymore, and my dad is never around (as usual).

Speaking of my father...

He's one of the reasons I'm so upset right now.  All my life, the only thing I've wanted from him was for him to be there for me when I need him--to be a <i>father</i> and not just some guy I see two or three times a year.  I've always felt like I was this huge disappointment in his eyes.  He makes plenty of time for his other two children, so why not me?  Am I an embarrassment to him?  Is he so hell-bent on maintaining his youth that a 27-year-old daughter is a hindrance?  Seriously, what is it?

When I was eight years old, my dad got sent away to prison for a while (drugs, I think).  What does he say to me the day he's supposed to be taken away?  I love you, and I'll miss you?  No.  I believe his words were, ""Let's see if you can lose some of that weight while I'm gone, okay?""  I was eight fucking years old!  Needless to say, I didn't...and it was a frequent subject of discussion throughout the next decade.  He finally eased up when I went through my suicidal period during my senior year of high school, but the damage had already been done.  That coupled with malicious comments from other people that I was very close to led to a great deal of self-loathing.

In addition to the poor body image that he bestowed upon me, he was simply just never there for me.  I'd see him for Christmas...maybe my birthday if I was lucky...and sometime during the summer or something.  He'd give me money (to make up for the fact that he was never around, I'm guessing), but what I wanted was a dad.  This absence of his contributed to what is still one of my biggest problems:  my complete and utter dependence on whoever it is that I'm dating.

When I was 16 or 17, someone that I liked showed some interest in me, and I absolutely latched onto it.  Up until that point, I hadn't received any positive attention from any males in my life, and this guy filled a void inside me someplace.  It certainly felt like love at the time, and I don't doubt that it was (on my end, at least--I know he never felt that way about me), but it was unhealthy love.  Obsessive love.  Due to that and a number of other factors, things ended shortly after they began...and I was devastated.  I didn't know how to deal with what I was feeling, and as a result, I made a lot of decisions that I deeply regret to this day.  I wish I had known then what I know now--that I'd had the experience and the wisdom to make better choices.  It ultimately ended up costing me a close friend.  I've accepted the fact that he'll probably never speak to me again, but I still miss him sometimes.  ::shrug::

Since then, I've only dated two guys:  Robbie and Jer.  Robbie was a <i>huge</i> mistake.  I don't know why it ever happened to begin with.  I was never attracted to him in the slightest, and we had nothing in common.  Nevertheless, the relationship ended up lasting three years.  Looking back, I think it was partially a rebound gone horribly wrong, and partially that he was completely non-threatening.  My subconscious knew that he was safe--that he'd never leave me--and that was what I needed at the time.  I eventually realized that that's why I was with him and promptly ended things.  He got over things pretty quickly, so that's good.  We stayed friends for a little while, but eventually just stopped talking completely, since we really didn't have anything to say to each other anymore.

Now, we have Jer.  Jer who lied to me for years.  Jer who cheated on me with is ex-girlfriend.  Jer who has absolutely no motivation to do anything in life other than watch movies and play video games.  Jer who looks down upon Christianity and who hates school and books and everything else that I love.  Somehow, after all of this, I'm still very much in love with him.  How am I supposed to know if I'm with him for the right reasons?  I can't imagine my life without him, but what if that's just my dependant nature?  I know it would be good for me to have some time on my own so I can become my own person, but how do you do that after you're engaged and have been living together for four years?  I'm so confused.  I don't want to push him away and end up losing him.  ::sigh::

That's too much for me to think about right now, though.  Back to the issue at hand (my father, my dependency, and my poor body image).

There was another event in my life that caused me to lose a few friends.  When I was 19, I basically decided that I was bi-sexual.  I can honestly say now that I'm not, but at the time, that seemed like my only option.  Two factors contributed to the delusion:  

1)  Years of hating myself and wanting to be skinny and pretty had developed into an obsession.  The longing to <i>look</i> like these girls somehow turned into a longing to <i>be</i> with these girls.  I know that no one can possibly understand this unless they've gone through it, and it probably wouldn't have happened at all if it hadn't been for the second factor.

2)  This was when I was 19.  I was still in the process of recovering from the emotional roller-coaster I had gone through with that first guy.  I had been rejected by him, my stepfather was abusive, and my father was pretty much non-existent.  To say that I was pissed of at men is an understatement.  I wanted nothing more to do with any of them.  They had done nothing but hurt me my entire life, and I was done with it.  

Those two factors (along with my emotional fragility at the time) were too much for my brain to handle.  Thus, I determined that I must be bi-sexual.  Most of my friends were okay with it, but I ended up losing a couple of them.  Sad, seeing as how it ended up not even being true.  It took years, but eventually, I forgave the men in my life, and I started to actually like myself for who I was--and, with that, the feelings were gone.  I feel bad for even saying anything about it to begin with, and I'm just glad I never dragged my family into it.  I do miss my friends, though.

::sigh::

So, yeah...I think I need to maybe sit down with my dad sometime if I can ever get a hold of him.  I don't expect him to change, but I think it would be therapeutic for me to get this all out in the open.  Maybe I could get some answers finally...or at least some closure.  

I still have a splitting headache, but writing this all out has helped a bit.  I've kept it inside for so long.  It would be nice if I could've actually vented <i>to</i> someone, rather than in a journal that no one reads, but it's a start.  I'm feeling well enough now where I can probably go start dinner.  Jer will be home in an hour or so, and he's been having a tough time with this internship, so I figure I'll be nice and have dinner waiting for him when he gets home.  I'm sure I'll think of more stuff to vent about, so until next time..."

"event","I've got about half an hour before I have to start getting ready for work.  Jer is gone, I'm bored with WoW and Guild Wars, and I can't think of a single thing to do, so I guess updating is my only option.  Sad.  =P

As usual, nothing exciting going on.  Jer started his internship this week, and he absolutely <i>hates</i> it.  I'm trying to convince him to stick it out, since it's only for five weeks.  Plus, his reasons for wanting to quit are 1) he doesn't have as much time to sit around playing video games and watching TV (boo hoo), and 2) he comes home sore every night.  What's he expect?  He's never had a job, he's been sitting on his ass for the past lord-knows-how-many years...his body isn't used to it.  I keep telling him it'll get better, but he doesn't believe me.  Whatever.  There's only so much I can do.  If he quits and has to leave school and move back down to the Rez, so be it.  I won't be going with him.  That sounds harsh, I know, but I'm just getting so sick of all of this.  ::sigh::

(Hrm...he reads this journal sometimes, so I suppose I should watch what I say.)

I'm thinking about starting college again.  I still have no idea what I want to major in, but I figure I can at least get my generals out of the way.  If I follow the MN Transfer Curriculum, it'll count as my generals at any public university in Minnesota.  I'd want to stay up here for the first two years, though, so we'll see if I can find a way to make it work.  I know Jer has to move back down to the Rez when he's done with school, so that might mean that we'd be living separately for a while.  Scary.  I've never really been on my own before.  Might be good for me.  ;)

Okay, I've gotta go have lunch and get ready for work.  I'm sure I'll update again soon.  (I've been in that frustrated-and-need-to-vent mood a lot lately.)"

I dunno about that ""picky and rigid"" part, and I'm pretty sure my power symbol would be something other than a square, but the rest rings true.  ;)

"event","My life remains fairly uneventful, and I guess that's fine with me right now.  Seems every time something starts to happen, it's something bad.  I'd much rather have my life be calm and somewhat boring than stressful and drama-filled.  I'm sure it's only a matter of time until things get stirred up again, though...so I'll just try to enjoy this while it lasts.

I've been at my new job for over a month now, and I'm actually really liking it.  I don't think I've ever been able to say that about the other jobs I've had.  I always used to dread going in to work--so much so that I'd eventually end up quitting.  It's not like that with this job, though.  While I can't exactly say that I look forward to going in every day, I definitely don't dread it.  Some days I just get to sit around and play games with the kids all day...or do art projects or whatever.  Very low-stress.  Plus, all of my co-workers are really nice, which helps a lot.  The only thing I'm not looking forward to is Winter.  They let the kids play outside as long as it stays above 10 degrees below zero.  That's right.  10 <i>below</i>.  Ugh...I am <i>not</i> a Winter person.  ::sigh::

Hrm...let's see...what else?  Man, I need to have kids or something so I have something interesting to talk about.  =P  That won't be happening for a long-ass time, though, unfortunately.  Need to get married first, and find a house, and I'd like to go back to college, which I figure I'd better do <i>before</i> I have children.  Man, I'm gonna be in my mid-thirties before I can even start thinking about it.  =(  I wanted to be done by the time I hit 30.  >.<  Lame.

"event","So, I noticed that I haven't really updated since July.  Pretty sad.  It's not that I don't have time to get on here...it's just that my life is fairly uneventful.  (I'm attempting to change that, though.)

Actually, I have a good excuse for not updating in August.  I've had issues with my back since I was 12 years old, and at the beginning of the month, it completely spazzed out on me.  I had been planning on going to Michigan with my aunts to see a bunch of my extended family, but I ended up having to stay home instead.  I was so bummed.  I spent nearly the entire month in bed--even standing up was excruciating.  

By the beginning of September, I was able to get up and walk around and even go shopping for limited amounts of time.  It took another couple of weeks before I was really back to normal, though.  Most boring month and a half EVER.  I never wanted to see my bedroom again after that.  My back still gets really sore from time to time, so I have to be extremely careful.  I do NOT want to have to go through that again.

Anyway, as soon as I was able to resume my normal lifestyle, I started looking for a job.  Things have been extremely tight around here lately (and that's putting it gently), so I figured it was about time.  My brother and his girlfriend both work for a school-run child care program, and they let me know that there were some positions available there.  I applied and, soon after, was asked to come in and interview.  Now, I'm <i>notoriously</i> bad at interviews.  I <i>always</i> mess up in one way or another.  The interviewer told me afterwards that she had more interviews to conduct and that she'd give me a call sometime the following week.  Needless to say, I wasn't very optimistic.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about, though, because she called me that very week and offered me a job!

I've been working there for about two and a half weeks now, and I'm really liking it so far.  I mean, it's still a job, so I whine to Jer about having to go every day...but as far as jobs go, this one is pretty sweet.  I work Monday through Friday from 2:00pm to 5:45pm.  It's great to finally have a job where I always know which days I'm going to be working.  It's also nice that it's during the day!  I was so sick of that third-shift crap.  It's not a ton of hours, but I get paid decently, so it works out.  Some days I just get to sit in a room and play games with the kids all day and get paid for it.  Rough, huh?  =)

Today, I'm not so lucky, though.  I get to be the Runner, which is just as fun as it sounds.  ::gag::  I get to run kids up and down the stairs all day, to and from the computer lab.  There are a <i>ton</i> of stairs there, and I'm not exactly in good shape (or even in mediocre shape, for that matter).  I don't even know if I'm going to be able to do it, but I guess I'll have to try.  I'm not the only girl there that's overweight, and they all manage to do it.

Speaking of being overweight, I think I'm going to join Weight Watchers again this week.  It's a really good program, and I had some success with it when I tried it before.  I'm bummed that I had to quit, but I just couldn't afford to keep going.  Now, my grandma has offered to pay for the meetings, so I really don't have an excuse not to go.  =)  I'll probably start tomorrow morning--I'm psyched!

Other than all of that, nothing is really new.  Jer and I still haven't set a date for the wedding, my mom is still fighting her alcoholism and depression, my dad is still never there for me (don't know if I covered that in previous entries).  I'm really trying to focus on the positive, though.  I went through my own depression when I was a teenager, and it was a scary place to be.  I don't ever want to get like that again.  Life is too beautiful to waste being sad and withdrawn.

Anyway, I'm gonna go spend some time with the boy before I have to go to work.  I'll try to update again soon.  Bye for now!"

"event","I'm actually in a pretty decent mood right now, oddly enough.  So much crap has been going on lately, and I've been finding it increasingly difficult to keep my spirits up.  Undoubtedly, things are going to end up getting worse before they get better, but for now--""now"" possibly meaning only the next hour or so--I'm not feeling all that bad.

Hmm...where to begin...

Well, Jer royally fucked up his schooling.  He failed most of his classes last semester, and he failed his only class the semester prior to that.  His reservation has been paying for everything (tuition, books, supplies, etc.), but it's on the condition that he 1) goes to school full time, and 2) maintains a high enough GPA.  Well, needless to say, his GPA is <i>way</i> lower than it should be.  This means that he is, most likely, going to have to move back down to the reservation very soon <i>and</i> pay back all the money that they've given him for college.  Wonderful.  We have a hard enough time getting by the way it is (since his ex-girlfriend gets $1300 a month in child support).  Now, we'll have an additional $400 or so to pay each month.  Lovely.  

Another aspect of it that sucks is that I'd have to choose if I want to continue living up here (with my mom, who needs me), or if I want to move down to the rez and live with his mother and brother for the next six months.  Blah.  We can't get out of our lease here until January, so we have to pay for the apartment regardless.  This means we couldn't get a place of our own down there until then (at least).  What a pain in the ass.  I <i>really</i> don't want to move, but I don't want to be up here by myself, either.  My only hope is that the education committee reviews Jer's situation and lets him continue going to school.  It's a small chance, but it's a chance, nevertheless.  We should find out in the next few days if they approve it or not, so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed.

Okay, on to the next headache-inducing subject.

My mother is going back into rehab, I guess.  I know she has been talking about it for a while now, but apparently, she's made up her mind.  This isn't the bad part.  In fact, if she's really going, I think it's a very good thing.  What has been frustrating is the fact that she's been debating this for the past several months.  She's been living at home with her husband (who is also an alcoholic, though he'll never admit it), drinking like crazy, and sitting in her room crying all day for what seems like forever.  She needs to get away from him, but she doesn't want to leave my brothers or the dog, and she doesn't want to be away from home.  We keep reassuring her that we'll all be fine if she goes back, but I think it was mainly that <i>she</i> needs to convince <i>herself</i> that she wants/needs to go.  Sounds like she may have done just that, because my brother told me that she's going back into a 28-day program.  I'll have to call her later and ask her about it.  I kinda dread my conversations with her, because they end up being an hour of her crying and being depressed, which, consequently, gets <i>me</i> depressed.  She doesn't really have anyone else to talk to about this stuff, though...so I kinda feel like it's my responsibility to be there for her and counsel her.  I don't mind.  I'd rather be a bit down and let her vent than have her sit at home and be miserable by herself.

Not <i>everything</i> has been bad lately.  Jer and I went to Valleyfair with my brother Sean and his friends.  I was kinda down that day, but it was fun anyway.  I'm not up for all the insane rides that they like, though.  Steel Venom?  Wild Thing?  No thanks.  I can handle spinning around and going upside-down and stuff, but anything with a huge drop is out of the question (which eliminates at least half of the rides right there).  =P  If I go back next year, I might try to be a bit more adventurous.  I felt kinda lame this time.

Another positive thing is that I get to go to Michigan in two weeks!  I'm so excited.  Jer and I and a bunch of my family from Minnesota are going up to Michigan to see the rest of our family.  It's been a good five years since I've seen most of them, so I'm psyched.  Jer has never met any of them, either, so it'll be interesting.  Aside from the fact that I get to see all of them, I'm just excited that I finally get a bit of a vacation.  =P  Granted, it's only an eight-hour drive, but we'll be staying at this camp out in the woods of the Upper Peninsula, right on the shore of Lake Superior.  It'll be so nice.  Yay...can't wait. =)

Okay, well...it's noon and I still haven't had breakfast yet, so I suppose I should go do that.  I'll try to think of more stuff to write about.  There's <i>got</i> to be more stuff that I need to vent about."

"event","Sooooo...I'm sitting here all by myself, bored outta my mind.  Jer has school today, and after that, he has to drive down to the Rez to pick up his brother.  I could've gone with, but I figured, ""Hmmm...it might be nice to chill out at home and play some World of Warcraft.""  I remembered too late that today is Tuesday, which is maintenance day for WoW.  So, yeah...no gaming for me for at least a few more hours yet.  Blah.

Jer's brother, Steven, will be staying with us for a couple of days so that he can see the midnight showing of ""Star Wars: Episode III"" with us.  (I generally don't like having people stay with us, but I'll deal.)  Jer is totally psyched to go see the movie.  He's had an ""Episode III"" countdown timer on the desktop of his laptop for at least a month now.  =P  What a dork.

I suppose I should enjoy this quiet time while I can.  Starting in a couple of weeks, I'm going to be mad busy.  I've got my brother Sean's graduation coming up, followed by my friend Lisa's bachelorette party.  Then we've got Pow-wow...then Lisa's bridal shower.  Somewhere in there, I'll be getting engaged, as well.  Then Lisa will come back from her wedding in Vegas and have a reception here at some point.  That takes care of June.  Then there's Fourth of July and my family reunion in Michigan...and, at some point, we were thinking about taking my brothers over to House on the Rock and maybe Wisconsin Dells or Six Flags.  It's gonna be a crazy Summer.  I'm excited, though.  I usually never get to do anything, so this should be fun.

Man, I've really got to stop perpetuating the blond stereotype.  I just tried to hang up my phone on the mouse charger.  >.<

I desperately want to get out of Minnesota for a while.  I don't even remember the last time we had a nice, sunny day.  It's been raining for the past month or so...and before that it was snowing.  We even got some snow in May.  So wrong.  In a month or two I'll be begging for weather like this, though.  I'm a wuss when it comes to heat.  Anything above 80 degrees is too much for me.  Isn't there anyplace in the world where the temperature stays between 65 and 75 degrees year-round?  I'd so move there.

Well, I guess I'm gonna go watch some TV or something until the WoW servers are up and running.  I'll probably write more later, as the servers are almost <i>never</i> up at the scheduled time.  Bye for now."

"event","Jer and I have been looking at engagement rings for the past month or so.  After fruitlessly checking out several jewelry stores in the area, I decided to ask my dad for help.  (My dad is one of those people that has a <i>ton</i> of connections.)  Turns out he has a good friend that is a jeweler.  We checked out his shop, and found a ring that I really liked.  It didn't have the diamond set in it at that point, but they set one on top of it so I could get an idea of what it looked like.  I almost would've said ""yes"" to it at that point, but I wanted to give it a little more thought.

I talked to my dad a few days later, and since the diamond that they showed us would've been way below our budget, he suggested that we ask to see a bigger, higher quality one.  He talked to his jeweler friend, and he agreed to find something really nice for me.  They got the ring in yesterday (mounted and sized and everything), so we went to take a look at it.  It was absolutely beautiful!  Not a <i>huge</i> diamond (.77 carat), but bigger than anything I had hoped to be able to afford.  We decided to buy it right then and there.  

So, now we have a ring here someplace, but I don't get to wear it or even look at it yet, because Jer wants to ""officially"" propose.  It's driving me nuts!  =P  I want to be able to show it to people and tell people that I'm engaged, but I guess I'll just have to be patient.  Oh, well...an exercise in willpower.  Heaven knows I need it.

Let's see...what else is going on...

My mother and grandmother will be coming over shortly.  A couple of Christmases ago, my mom bought me a sewing machine, and I've never taken the time to learn how to use it, so my grandma is going to give me a quick lesson.  Makes me feel kinda old fashioned to be learning how to sew, but I suppose it would be a useful skill to have...especially when I have kids of my own.  I can make them outfits for Pow-wow dancing and stuff.  =)

I usually don't get to see my grandmother all that often, but this will be the second time I've seen her in less than a week (the first of which was Mother's Day).  It'll be nice to spend some more time with her.  My mother will get some time out of the house, too, which she desperately needs.

For Mother's Day, I bought blank cards for both of them, and wrote my own messages inside.  Made them both cry.  =P  I think they went something like the following.

For my grandmother's card:

<i>When I journey, someday, down the path of motherhood, I hope to be blessed with all of the kindness, wisdom, strength, and love that you so often exhibit.  You have been an inspiration to me, and I admire you more than you know.  On this and all days, you deserve special recognition.  Thank you...for everything that you have done and for everything that you are.  I love you, Grandma.  Happy Mother's Day!</i>

My mother's card actually had an Emerson quote on the front:

<i>What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.</i>

On the inside, I wrote:

<i>What lies within me is the strength, faith, and love of my mother.  I cannot undo the past, just as I cannot predict the future, but, armed with these gifts that you have given me, I know that I can weather any storm.  Thank you so much for being the amazing mother that you have been and continue to be.  I am truly blessed.  Happy Mother's Day, mom.  I love you.</i>

They were both in tears after reading them.  =P  That doesn't take much with my family, though.  We're all uber-emotional.  I'm just glad that I took the time to write something meaningful this year.  I usually just buy a pre-written card and leave it at that.  I don't have to feel like such a bad daughter/granddaughter now.  ^.^

Okay, well...I've got to finish cleaning the place up before they get here.  I'll write more later."

Well, my mom stayed at the treatment center for a month, and we all really thought that it had helped her, but alas, upon returning home, she almost immediately began drinking again.  Not a surprise, really.  Thirty days just isn't enough to undo twenty plus years of alcohol abuse.  The alcoholism is just a fragment of the problem, anyway.  She's struggling with <i>extreme</i> anxiety and depression; it's to the point where she can't even leave the house most days.  Her husband (my stepfather) recently lost his job, too...so now they don't have medical insurance, making any kind of treatment an impossibility.  She has already tried everything, anyway.  None of it has helped.

I feel so helpless.  I want to be able to <i>do</i> something...to make her better somehow.  It breaks my heart when I talk to her.  She's in so much pain, and she's crying out for help, but there's nothing any of us can do that we're not already doing.  

My grandmother (an amazing woman with a great store of wisdom), has reminded me on several occasions that, while we should offer help where we can, we should not sacrifice our own happiness and sanity worrying about things that we have no power to change.  I'm trying desperately to follow that advice, but it's difficult.  I love my mother so much, and I'd give anything to see her happy again.

If nothing else, I can say that this has made me a stronger person.  I've dealt with things over the past year that, in earlier days, would've left me emotionally crippled.  They have left scars, of course (a reminder of the life lessons learned), but I remain a generally happy and healthy person.

On a happier note, it's a beautiful Spring day here in Minnesota.  No more winter!  I think I'm going to go outside and enjoy it while it lasts.  =)"

"event","Well, damn...it's been a <i>long</i> time since I last posted.  I think I got everything out of my system back then and ran out of stuff to say.  =P  I want to keep this journal somewhat updated, though, so I'll try to come up with something.

Things have been going much better with Jer and I.  No more cheating drama, for the most part.  (It still gets brought up now and then, but those occasions are few and far between).  We've even been fighting less, which is great.  Now we just need to save up enough money for an engagement ring.  =)

I had a crazy holiday season at Kohl's.  I went from working one day a week to working four.  It was nice to have that much money coming in, but I'm glad that things are calming down now.  I saved up a good portion of the money that I was getting, too, so things won't be as tight financially (at least for a few months).

I got to see my dad today (finally).  It's been months since I saw him last.  He's <i>always</i> busy.  I'm used to it, though.  That's the way it's always been with him.  I'm not saying I'm okay with it or anything...just that I don't expect much of him anymore.

My mom is the major cause of my stress now.  A few years ago, she was diagnosed with situational depression.  She's also an alcoholic, and has been for as long as I can remember.  Things have been going steadily downhill with her over the years. She ended up leaving her job because she couldn't function there anymore, and now she's pretty much incapacitated.  She sits in her room all day and cries.  She can't handle going to family functions or anything.  I feel so bad for her.

She's got an appointment today at a world famous rehabilitation center, so hopefully they'll accept her.  If they do, she'll be gone for a month.  It's right here in Minnesota, though, so at least we'll be able to visit her on Sundays.  She's scared to death of leaving the boys and the dog for that long, but we all reassured her that things would be fine.  I hope more than anything that this works.  I miss my mom.

I have to get some sleep before work, but I'll try to write again soon."

"event","The past month or so has been blessedly uneventful.  Normally, I would find this to be painfully boring, but after all of the stuff that had been going on, it was nice to have some down time.  Jer and I have been focusing on getting our relationship back to where it used to be, and we're actually making a bit of progress.  I still have days where I wonder if he's the one I'm supposed to be with, but that will resolve itself in time, I think.  I'm not going to stress out about it at this point.  I've got other things to worry about.

Speaking of which, I need to find a bankruptcy lawyer.  Fun stuff.  When I was younger, I was completely irresponsible with my credit cards and ended up getting myself deeply in debt ($15,000 or so).  For a long time, I managed to stay on top of my monthly payments, but I eventually fell behind, and now I don't have any hope of ever being able to pay them off.  So, I get to declare bankruptcy.  Yay.  

I was reading up on it, and I guess the average cost (including the forms and lawyer) ends up being about $1,000.  What the hell?  After rent, Jer's car payment, and his child support payment, we barely have enough money left over at the end of the month to pay our phone and electricity bills.  Both have been shut off recently, actually (but are back on now, thank god).  All of the money that I make at my job (which isn't much) goes to our food and car insurance.  How the bloody hell do they expect me to save up $1,000?  Grrr.

Luckily, I think we've found a way to make it work.  Jer usually gets a Christmas bonus in December, but they decided to give them out early this year.  Most of it has to go to bills and such, but I think we're going to have enough left over to cover the bankruptcy.  That takes a <i>huge</i> weight off of my shoulders.  I know my credit will be screwed for the next ten years or so, but it would be regardless of whether or not I declared bankruptcy, so I might as well do it and get rid of the debt.

Now I just have to figure out how to go about finding a good bankruptcy lawyer.  I've never needed a lawyer for anything before, so this should be interesting.  Maybe I'll call my dad and see if he has any advice.  He always seems to be talking to one of his lawyers about something or other.

Anyway, other than the bankruptcy, things are going fairly well.  This early bonus has been a godsend.  We finally get to relax a little bit.  It won't last forever, but we're trying to get back on our feet while we have the means to do so.  It would be nice if Jer attempted to get a job, but I'm not going to push him.  That's his deal.

Well, I'm getting a bit sleepy, so I'm gonna go chill out with the boy for a while.  I'll try to update again soon."

"event","*sigh*  Here we go.  I've been trying to figure out how to approach all of this, but it just never felt like the right time.  I think I'm finally ready to write about it, though.  What follows is the cause of all of my recent frustration...and the motivation for starting this journal.

Okay, like I said before, I've been dating Jeremy for nearly three years now, and he has a child with another girl (blah blah blah).  He and his ex, Denise, have always hated each other.  She's done nothing but badmouth him and use their son as leverage the entire time I've known him.  Also, she get's $1300 a <i>month</i> from him in child support, and she's using it as her sole source of income.  They can barely speak civilly with one another, which is why I found it so odd when they started being friendly with each other back in May.  They started talking all the time, and I know he told her some stuff about our relationship.  One night, she called at about 1:00 in the morning and asked if he could meet her someplace to talk.  I should've told him not to go, but since she's the mother of his child, I didn't feel that I had the right to.  I found out a day or two later that they had talked about <i>possibly</i> getting back together.  Jer said he wasn't serious about it or anything, but it still really freaked me out.

A couple weeks after that, Jer told me that he wasn't sure if he wanted to be with me anymore, and that he wanted to take a break.  He ended up staying with his family for a while, but he eventually came back up here so we could work things out.  He swears to this day that it didn't have anything to do with Denise, but I find that hard to believe.

A couple months went by, and I <i>thought</i> everything was getting better...but then I found a bunch of e-mails that he had sent her just a few days beforehand.  He seriously wrote her maybe five or six e-mails over the course of a week...all of them saying how much he loved her and how beautiful she was and *ahem* how great the sex was.  Excuse me???  Sex???  Needless to say, I completely lost it.  I confronted him about it right away, and at first he tried to deny that anything had happened.  I showed him the e-mails, and he eventually confessed.  I asked him who he wanted, and his answer was ""Well, if I <i>had</i> to choose, I'd choose you.""  Not exactly reassuring.

I would've left right then and there, but I didn't trust myself to drive, and I couldn't find anyone to pick me up.  Instead, I ended up talking to him for hours about what had happened and why it had happened.  He didn't have many answers.  He said that he didn't feel that way about her anymore, and that he didn't remember much of what had happened.  Apparently, she had been drinking and had started something with him, and he just didn't stop it.  What really pissed me off was that he didn't tell me right away, and that he actually slept with me after he slept with her.  We never use protection, and he didn't use it with her, either...and this girl is a major slut.  I'm not just saying that because I don't like her.  She sleeps with <i>everybody</i>, male and female.  He could've got her pregnant again, or he could've gotten an STD.  Ick.

Anyway, at some point, I decided that I wanted to try to work though all of it and not just throw the past three years of my life away (I probably should've just walked).  Ever since then, our relationship has been really rocky.  I tried for months to get over it, but it's still there in the back of my mind.  

A month or so ago, Jer and I went out with a friend of ours (Dan) and a girl that he knew from chat.  I've known Dan as long as I've known Jer, and he's an awesome guy.  We all drank way too much that night (except for Jer, who never drinks), and things got a little out of hand.  There's a lot about that night that I'm not going to get into (mostly because I want to forget about it), but there's one part that I have to mention.  I got really sick at one point, and when I came back from the bathroom, I sat down next to Dan.  I asked Jer to go get me some water, and when he left, Dan reached over and slid his hand up my skirt and felt me up.  Now, I've had a thing for Dan for a while now, but he had <i>never</i> expressed any interest in me before this.  He basically ended up telling me that he wanted to go down on me, and that he didn't have any interest in the girl that was there with him.  I was beyond shocked.  He and the girl ended up staying at our apartment that night, and he told me to come back out of Jer fell asleep.  He never did, so nothing happened.

A couple nights later, however, I ended up going over to Dan's place.  Jer was <i>not</i> happy, but I was still pissed about the whole Denise thing, so I really didn't care at that point.  I mean, of course I felt bad going over there, because it goes against my nature, but I kinda felt like he deserved it.  We ended up messing around for a while.  Mostly just kissing, but he did end up going down on me, too.  I had told Jer that nothing would happen that night,and that I'd be home by midnight.  Well, I didn't get home until about 5:00 in the morning, and obviously something did happen.  He was upset when he found out, but he knew that he had it coming.

I know that two wrongs don't make a right, and I probably shouldn't have done what I did...but I was <i>so</i> mad about the whole Denise thing.  So, now Jer and I are more or less even (in some strange, fucked up way).  I'd like for this to be the end of our troubles, but it isn't.  While Jer's infidelity made him completely sure that he wants to be with me, mine has had the opposite effect.  I honestly don't know if I want to be with him anymore.  I'm always going to love him; I just don't know if I'm <i>in</i> love with him at this point.

Jer and I have had a great relationship for the most part, and I always want him to be a part of my life, but lately I've been wondering if there might be someone better for me out there.  We've got a lot of differences that are starting to catch up to us.  Our beliefs are different...our goals...our plans for the future.  I mean, we both want to get married and have kids, but that's pretty much where his goals end.  There's so much that I want to do with my life.  I know he'd be content living down on the Reservation for the rest of his life, but I can't do that.  He hates school, he has no respect for Christianity, he's unmotivated and has no desire to get a job, he's content just sitting around and watching TV all the time.  *sigh*  I'm so confused.

Leaving him would mean giving up everything I've known for the past three years.  I'm completely dependant upon him.  Not only would I be losing my relationship, but I'd be losing my apartment and most of our belongings.  I'm in the process of saving up money to declare bankruptcy, because I'm about $15,000 in debt...so there's no way I'd ever be able to get another apartment or anything.  My only hope would be to either stay with my mom or dad, or go to college and live on campus.  Both of those options leave a lot to be desired, but I'm not going to stay with Jer just because I need a place to live.

Grrr...I don't know what to do.  I do love him.  I just don't know if we're right for each other.  How am I supposed to make a decision like that?  Either way, it's a gamble.  I can either stay with him and for sure get married and have kids in the near future, but risk the fact that I might regret it down the road, <i>or</i> I could leave him and risk the chance that I might not ever find someone else...and that I might never get to have kids.  Hell, I'm already almost 27.  I want to have kids by the time I'm 30.  *sigh*  What am I supposed to do?  

Okay, I can't think about it anymore tonight.  I'll end up crying all night at work.  I'm gonna go find something to distract me until I have to leave.  =P  Later."

"event","It's been <i>nine days</i> since the last time I worked.  Fun.  Now I have to work the next four days in a row.  I'm thankful that they're finally increasing my hours again, but after such a long break, it's gonna suck.  I'm gonna be soooooo sore by Tuesday morning.  I don't even do anything very strenuous...it's just that I've had back problems since I was 12 years old, and even standing for eight hours is sometimes too much for me to handle.  It doesn't help that I have these massive boobs pulling on my back, either.  =P

Speaking of which, I think I'm really gonna crack down and try to get in better shape.  I've always been a bigger girl, and I never expect to be thin or anything...but even losing a little bit of weight would be better than nothing.  My doctor told me that, if I don't start doing something about it, I'm seriously going to affect how long I live.  I'd always known that, but it freaked the hell out of me when I actually heard my doctor say it.  So, yeah...time for me to really focus on getting healthier.

I know a bunch of people who have gotten that gastric bypass surgery.  I never thought that route was right for me, but I looked into it anyway, just because I'd seen how well it worked for others.  I found out that my insurance doesn't cover it, so even if I wanted to have it done, I couldn't.  Just as well, I suppose.  I'd rather do it the natural way.  I've actually already managed to lose 30 pounds or so on my own.  I had gained since high school, though...so I've still got a long way to go to get back to that point.

In addition to getting healthier, I'm really working on turning my whole life around.  I don't want to talk about all of that here, though.  It deserves its own entry."

I <i>am</i> in the mood to go back to sleep, but I've already had 9 hours, so I think I'm good.  =P  I usually only sleep for 6 or 7 hours.  Don't know what's up with me today.

I went and saw ""Shaun of the Dead"" yesterday.  <i>Awesome</i> movie!  I hadn't seen a commercial for it prior to that, so I had no idea what to expect, but it was absolutely hilarious.  I doubt I'll be able to talk Jer into seeing it (not really his kind of movie), but I'm definitely going to tell my brother to see it.  

I also watched ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" last night for the first time.  Another hilarious movie.  Weird, but hella funny.  It had me laughing hysterically, but that could've been partially alcohol-induced.  =P  Plus, I was watching it with my friend Dan, and his laugh is infectious.

Speaking of infectious...a bunch of people in chat have been talking about how sick they are (some even claim to have malaria, which I doubt).  I went over to Dan's last night, and I guess he's sick, too.  Yay.  That means I'm probably going to get sick.  *sigh*  I'll just have to deal with it, though, because I can't afford to miss work.  They've already cut my hours down to one or two days per week.  Bastards. >_<

I should really call my dad at some point.  Not that he'd be home...and not that he'd return my call.  Worth a shot, though.  If I <i>do</i> miraculously get a hold of him, he's just going to try to talk me into taking care of my great grandma down in Fort Lauderdale.  *shudder*  No thank you.  I need to pick something up at his house, though, so I'm going to have to brave the dangers of talking to him.

Actually, I am going to go call my mom, I think.  I took a bunch of pictures of my brother the other day, and he needs to decide which one he wants to use for his senior picture.  Has to be in by Friday, so I've really gotta talk to them. 

I might write more later.  We'll see."

"event","Well, here we go.  My head is still full of a million different thoughts, and I still have no idea where to start, but I guess I'll just start writing and see what happens.  

In June of 2001, I (out of sheer boredom) began chatting online.  I found a local chatroom, and began talking to the people pretty regularly.  Apparently, a lot of them had actually met each other in person, so there were some really tight friendships there.  I chatted there for months, and in October of that year, I started talking to a guy named Jeremy.  I had seen him online a number of times, but he had been dating somebody else, so I never had a chance to talk to him prior to that.  We clicked right off the bat, and a few weeks after that, I had the opportunity to meet him.

A mutual friend of ours was having a party at her house, so I told her I'd go (even though I was completely freaked out).  Jeremy also decided to make the 2+ hour drive to come up and meet me.  He and I didn't talk to each other much at first (I was shy, and I think he mistook that for disinterest), but eventually he got me to open up a bit.  I'll spare you the details of the evening, but to make a long story short, we ended up sleeping with each other that night.  (Those that know me know that that's <i>completely</i> out of character for me.)

The next day, I went home, and he drove back to his place.  I talked to him online a <i>lot</i> over the course of the following week, and decided that I wanted to drive down to see him that weekend.  I ended up spending several days with him, and we've pretty much been inseperable ever since.  I moved in with him in February 2002, and that June we moved up here to the Cities.  We've been talking about marriage and kids for a long time now, but it just hasn't worked out yet.

So, that's an extremely short summary of my relationship and how it came to be.  It hasn't all been as peachy as it sounds, though.  We've had some major issues, some of which I'm still trying to work through.  I've put thoughts of marriage and children on hold for now until I get things figured out.

Before I get into any of that, I should probably talk a little more in-depth about Jer.  He's 25 years old (a year younger than me), and he's a native from the Lower Sioux Reservation down by Redwood Falls.  He gets money from the casino there, so he has never really had to work.  (That, in itself, has caused major issues.)  He's not supposed to live more than ten miles away from the Rez, but he's going to culinary school up here, so they're making an exception.  Once he's done with school--which should be in a year or so--he either has to move back down there or risk getting cut off financially.

Also, before I met him, he had been dating a girl named Denise.  I didn't realize it when he and I first hooked up, but she was pregnant with his child.  His son, Cody, was born in March of 2002.  Now, it was hard enough for me to date someone that was having a child with someone else, but what complicated it even more is that his ex is the bitchiest person on the face of the planet.  Seriously.  She's insane.  So, throughout our relationship, I've had to deal with endless drama from her.

All of that just scratches the surface of the issues we've had.  It goes <i>so</i> much deeper than that.  I'll probably get into some of it in my next entry, but I've got to sort it all out in my head first."

"event","I don't know why I'm even attempting to write when I'm this tired, but I'm bored outta my mind, and I still have another hour or two before I can go to sleep, so I've gotta do something.  Jeremy (sure to be the inspiration for numerous future entries) has been playing Fable for hours, so he's no help.  =P  Not that I blame him.  I've been messing around on the comp all night, so he had to entertain himself somehow.

So...umm...I guess I'll start by explaining the name.  I've made some stupid decisions in my life, and have always looked back on my past with a lot of regret.  That regret, coupled with current issues that I'm facing, kept building until it finally got to a point where I had to either let it consume me or let it die.  I chose the latter.  That's where the Requiem part comes in (and also the subtitle of my journal, A Dirge for Days Past).  The Sanguine part comes from the fact that, since letting go of the past, I've actually been excited and hopeful about the future.  I don't even remember the last time I could say something like that.  So, yeah...Sanguine Requiem.

Even though I've let go of my past, I'm sure I'll talk about it a lot in future entries.  It's not the memories that I'm leaving behind...just the bad feelings associated with them.  Even though some of the things that I've gone through have been painful, I wouldn't want to forget them.  They've helped to make me who I am...and I rather like myself at this point (which is something else that I can't remember ever being able to say before).  =P

Well, there are a ton of things that I want to write about, but they're going to have to wait until later.  If I tried now, it'd just end up being nonsensical rambling.  Must sleep first.  G'night.  ;)"

"event","This is my first online journal, and it's been a long time coming. I've been meaning to start one for years now, but haven't gotten around to it (due mainly to the fact that my life was rather uneventful). Now that everything has become a bit chaotic, I'm going to need a place to vent. I've got so much going on in my head, and I have no idea where to start, so I'm just going to worry about getting this initial entry out of the way before I attempt to sort through the rest of it.&nbsp; I might be slow to post at first (until I get used to keeping a journal), but I'm sure I'll be posting quite often eventually.&nbsp; I can't promise that it will all be interesting--or even coherent, for that matter--but I'll do my best.&nbsp; =P"

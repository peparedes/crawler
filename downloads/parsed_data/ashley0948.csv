I'll remember next time not to allow my wonderful cousin Matthew to ride in my car. GROSS.

Yesterday was a fun time!.
I always enjoy outing with Amy.
She's fun.
1st- Tess, Amy and myself went to warsaw to get out papers filled out.. that was an alright time other then them leading us in 100 different directions. I love tess. She cracks my shit up. I can't wait till August.
Then... Me & Amy went to our NeW aParTmenT.
I LOOOOOVVVVEEE our new apartment. I can not wait to move in!! God August isnt coming soon enough!.
After the apartment we went to MCC to get somethings squared away.. & then out to eat with my daddy!. I love olive garden.
Amy looooves the breadsticks! but who doesnt??
Then.. we had to go to this stupid meeting of scotts new business.. it wasnt too bad but i would have rather been somewhere else.

So-Yesterday i bought the Ashlee Simpson CD for 5$!! i couldnt fricken belive it!lol i love ashlee, shes a hot lady.
I also got Dirty Dancing Havana Nights..
MY favorite movie of all time. 
I suggest everyone watches it.
Me & amy did lastnight:) & i am again today.

I miss having ALL of my TaKa's all together in one sitting.
I can't wait till thursday:)
I love when we all hang out. Its sooo much fun.
I don't know what i would do w. out them.
It breaks my heart that karen is sad about her daddy:(
His b-day is today.
How terrible. She is such a strong Lady! 
I Love you kare!

I think i have mono....
I sleep ALL the time! forinstance i went to bed the other day at like 1am and slept till 12:30 in the afternoon.. had lunch & then at 1:30 went back to bed till 3.
I realy dont like it.
Booo being tired.
On that note-

"event","Yeahhh.. So it's 12:14 am ((as you can see above)) & I for some reason am SUUUUPer bored. This is my 2nd entry today, I MUST be bored!!

I seem to skim people's away messages when I am bored I have noticed. Forinstance- I will read everyone's away messages and then when i'm done read them again. Pathetic i know, but its just one of those pathetic days.
   Hopefully tomorrow will be better.

Infact i know it will.
          Tomorrow- I am.. going to Tess's house & then we are going to stupid Whoresaw to get our MCC papers signed and out of the way.. FINALLY. Then I belive my hot-ass lol Lady friend AMy May is going to Roc-cha-cha with me so that we can go to MCC & our Apartment:) & then we're swingin  by Karen's store. I'll enjoy that.

I enjoy our apartment.
I really do!.

Karen & I are SUUUUper silly tonight. I love it!
We have started a word of the day. 
Todays word is.....
ineffectual. 

Isnt that fun!!

So I really hope things work out w. me & a certain lady. I swear my mouth gets me in SOOO much trouble. Maybe I should get a muzzle or somethin. 
yeahhhhh... I think that would be perfect. 

OOHHHH--
I saw princess do it today. hehe..
It was kinda sad cause we had to hold her down so it felt like we we're allowing her to get raped but she liked it.. i know she did. Tego is SOOOO cute. 
I hope they have cute babies.
I know they will.
400$ a pop if ya want one :)

Jason is a butthole!. That's for my Amy May. 
This kid is sooo crazy i swear.
WHO wouldnt want Amy fricken Fuller?
EVERY guy in the world wants her.. He'll see.
...He is really missin' out. 
Oh- well.. His loss. 
She;s one hot mama.
& now shes one SINGLE hot mama!.

   These live journals are SOOOOOO gay but i am SOOOO bored & at the time it all works out.

              I think i need a real job.
                   The lumber co just isnt hackin it.

I's good money but they dont always need me so i find myself working 3 days a week which doesnt float my boat.

ummm... the wedding was nice.
  I definitely enjoy'd it.
The reception wasn't too boppin' but the important people were there.:) I love my friends.
  -Sam is sooo bad fricken ass!!. I dont know if it was the alochol or his new tattoo's that made him crazy but whatever it was it definitely was fun!.. Sorry multrips hehehe.
       if you dont see a sign on west ave I dont know who did it!! ;)

I really cant think of nething else to write other then...
 I hate dramatic people. what i also hate is how when IIIIII am talking to someone how it cant stay between them and myself. Everyone has to draagggg everyone else into everything, and its rather gay. I guess i have to just keep my mouth shut.. that'd probaly be the best thing for me.

I love my taka's.

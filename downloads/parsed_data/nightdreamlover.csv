"event","I can't believe it's been almost a month since I last written a journal entry, and honestly it's been one hell of a month. I'm starting to think that happiness is nothing more than a mat at the door in which I rub dirt into. I'm also starting to believe that I'm one of the least attractive people on earth. Even after spendin 114 dollars at the salon to get my hair permed, I feel even less attractive. Why would anyone ever want to be with me. I've learned that I need to let go, let go of the past, let go off everything. My heart freezes more and more...I remember a time not too long ago when I was so in love with everything: school, relationships, and life in general. It's hard to cover up the pain all the time, to suppress the emotions I feel.I used to be so open with my feelings, but I've started to shelter them and I've started to think twice before I say those three special words cause when you say I LOVE YOU to someone, everything changes. Sometimes I want life to just stand still, to stop moving and stop changing. You never know when someone is going to withdrawl their love. You never know when your going to get stabbed in the back again..."

"event","It's been awhile since I last really updated this journal...life never stops changing. That's for sure. I heard news this week that my mom might have cancer or some sort of other pathology of the uterus. I pray that the biopsy turns out negative it would make my life so much better. The thought of losing my mother is devastating. I can't wait to go home this weekend to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay.  So please if you read this keep her in your prayers. The power of prayer is amazing."

"event","This weekend was definately a very long and depressing weekend except for Saturday night. For a while now I haven't felt like myself. Not the normal happy, easy going Katie that I used to be. This past summmer I couldn't wait to come back here to Oswego, but now that I'm back I wish I was back home with people I can relate to and people who really truly love and care about my well-being. It's hard when you feel like you don't really have anyone to relate to. I'm always there to lend an ear to everyone else, to be there when no one else is, but it seems that rarely ever is reciprocated. It's pretty obvious that I'm not really happy here at OSU anymore. Yes I do care about the people here, but I would love to stay away from the drama, the backstabbing, the spats. It's too much for one to handle. Right now, I have relatively very few friends who I can consinder trustworthy or even friends for that matter. It's so  hard to come to terms with the fact that things and situations change. To be honest I would love to drop out of here, move away far away, and elope.  I know crazy huh? As much as I would just love to drive into the sunset, I know that I need to stay here and finish my education and get my doctorate in psychology. I just wish I didn't feel so damn miserable. I know life is a bunch of highs and lows but why does this one have to have sooo many..... Which brings me to my next relevation...God.   I've been doing a lot of thinking about my spirituality and God in my life.  It's been so long since I have had a personal relationship with God. I sort of let my faith slip away. I really want to get back to that. Get back to being right with God, back to the morals I used to have, the ones I held so dear.... I went to get back to being the Katie I was in high school, the girl who had a glimpse of hope for everything instead of this nagging cynicalism that I seem to have now. Just in case, I would like to clear up something I do have friends here at OSU who care about me (ya know who u are) and I thank u for that....its just hard being so far away from the ones u hold dear. Well enough of me rambling for night...i'll write more tomorrow"

At a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's 'bout ready to give up
That's when she says,""I've been there before
But keep on lookin' 'cause maybe who you're lookin' for is...""

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop
That you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at
But never really see
Somewhere out there
Oh somewhere out there is somebody"

It's weird jumping from ""life"" to ""life"" but I'm ready for the change. My packing still isn't anywhere near completion. I have so much to do, and working all day doesn't help matters much. Yes I know they want to give me hours which is great of them, but damn do I have to close three nights in a row, and be scheduled on Thursday after Wednesday was my designated last day? Mentally I feel burnout coming...... For the past week at work I've trained Amanda, training someone new at US NEWS is exhausting. The lotto machine can be very intimidating. Though it's really tiring, I still really like doing it and I think I'm pretty good at it. Most of the people I trained at McDonalds went on to become managers. I guess it shows that at least some people can learn well from me..... Well anyways I feel like I'm babbling so I'll write more lata."

I was so excited.... this was completely unexpected.  I'm really excited that me and Tony will get a chance to hang out together too. So that definately made yesterday a whole lot better :)

In other related happennings in my life.... I have to say goodbye again to Jake. It's hard knowing this may be the last time we see one another.  Talking today to him on the phone, I told him I was really surprised that even came to visit me in Oswego.. I was like you came all that way to see me? and he was like what's that supposed to mean...and I was like I'm just shocked that you'd do that for me.... I think in some ways I miss the friendship the two of us used to have: the one where we talked every night before bed. Things change, people change, relationships change.......I'm in the oh well suck it up and move on attitude.....

Tomorrow I'm going to coffee with Kurt, Jenn, and Brock. It's going to be hard to say goodbye to them too. I really wish the four of us would have hung out more often, but we all lead such busy lives."

Whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like I am home again
whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like I am young again
whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like I am fun again

However far away
I will always love you
however long I stay
I will always love you
whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like I am free again
whenever I'm alone with you
you make me feel like I am clean again

However far away
I will always love you
however long I stay
I will always love you
whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you"

It's time for me to tell that you've been keeping me warm 

Just sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings 
In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven 
Don't give it back, I've never felt so wanted 
Are you taking me home ? 

You tell me you have to go...

I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know

Now that you've left me, there's no retur-ning

Will you make me at home ?

Going to the mall, hanging at Tulleys, chilling at cassie's, running all over Oswego, and taking a three mile ( I swear it was 5) hike was exactly what the doctor ordered. There is so much I wish I could write about right now, but unfortunately I'm still tired as hell... I'll write more later."

It was great being able to see her again, it's hard to believe that it had been two years since we had been able to hang out.  Jess has one of the greatest boyfriends ever - George. I told her to hang on to him.  The two of them are perfect for one another. I can't wait until we can all hang out together again. When they come home again in Sept. Sarah and I are going to come home from Oz, that's the plan so far......  

I'm really starting to stress over money....it's driving me nuts... I'm not sure how much more I can take........I just hope I'm able to afford this semester otherwise Im not sure what I'm going to do.

Tomorrow I'm going shopping with the sis (Sarah) to finish buying things for school. It should be fun. The two of us can't go shopping with out the other..it's just not the same. We tell each other what to and what not to buy...... The last time we went together I even got her to buy a purse :) According to Blue, I need to stop buying purses. If I buy anymore, he swears that he'll burn 'em all. I guess I would just have to start over at square one again. Hehe. I can't wait to go visit him, hard to believe that it has been two months already since the end of the semester.

Well I think it's time for bed....i'm getting sleepy....i'll try to update this more often."

"event","My body is finally starting to adjust to the whole work two jobs thing. Each day gets easier and easier. Maybe it's because I'm on automatic pilot most of the time.  I swear I could do half of this stuff including all the math in my sleep. In some ways this is nice, while in many ways it leaves you few chances to be creative and independent, which kinda sucks. Going back to a job u left years ago is quite strange, it's almost like a time warp. A thousand things about u have changed, but when your there you seem to be that shy innocent girl who was still a senior in high school.  It brings back the memories of hanging with JB and RR. Those were some of the moments I felt like I was truly alive, instead of just living. It brings back the memories of midnight bowling, sleepovers with JM and KE, and flying over railroad tracks ( Not only was I innocent back then, but I may also have been stupid).  At work this morning I also seen my Course II teacher from high school, Mr. Kestler. It was kinda weird I was capable to seeing how much I've grown as a person by reflecting on my past. I know I've made mistakes, and at times I'm not happy with some of the choices I make, but I can honestly say I'm satisified with me. Everything I've done, every choice good or bad I've made has made me the person I am today.  And Honestly I REALLY don't care what other people think of me, and the way I live my life cause I'm happy with being me. :)"

"event","Have you ever just had one of those weeks, one of those weeks were you feel like your world- everything you've ever known is crashing down around you, leaving you feeling alone and vulnerable. That's how I feel. These Lyrics by Linkin Park say exactly how I feel: ""Memories consume, like opening the wounds.. Picking me apart again... I don't want to be the one the battles always choose. Cause inside I realize I'm the one confused. I don't know what's worth fighting for, why I had to scream. I don't know why I  instigate, to say what I don't mean. I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be all right. So I'm breaking the habit, breaking the habit tonight"" T

he wear and tear on my body this week both physically and mentally has been difficult. I'm very angry.....and anger is an emotion that I don't like to feel inside. I have a hard time expressing anger and usually it just turns into depression.. It's often been said that depression is simply anger from inside turned against oneself. Not only am I angry, but I feel guilty. I probably have one of the biggest guilt complexes in the world. I'm seriously consindering withdrawing from OSU. Running away and avoidance aren't good ways to solve anything, but sometimes they seem like the only viable options. 

I'm also having a real hard time distinguishing between people who are so called friends and then enemies. I continue to be betrayed. It is no one's right to divulge my personal information to people who hardly even know me. And then to have this person belive he now knows the whole truth about me, WTF... How the hell do you do know the whole me...Even the people I hold closest and dearest to my heart don't know who the real me is. It is that way even after you've known a person for years maybe even decades and they continue to do things that will surprise you. 

I'm sorry for complainin so much in here these past couple of weeks, but it's one of the only ways it relieves me of some of the bullshit I deal with on a daily basis.  And so I leave with a line from this poem that I remember..

Are we friends or are we not, You told me once but I forgot.......?"

"event","Though the past couple of days have been kind of testing, today seems like a much better day.  Though it may seem morbid tonight on my way home I stopped at the cemetery. During my senior year of high school, Pat, a kid everyone loved, died.  Somewhere within this cemetery he's buried, and unfortunately I couldn't find where his grave was. His death forever changed my life despite the fact that the two of us weren't very close. I thought that by visiting his grave, I could finally come to terms with the fact that someone I had grown up with was dead. I still don't understand why God would take someone who was so young, so full life, but who I am to question God's will. Seeing someone so young die, I finally realized how precious and fragile life truly is. So many times we take for granted, tomorrow and next week. I guess I just want to take time out to be thankful for today, and yesterday, and the hope of tomorrow. To thank those people who mean so much to me... There are no guarantees in life....."

"event","It's definately been a stressful couple of days for both me mentally, physically, and economically. It seems whenever I think I've fixed my car's problems, another one begins. I think it could my own curse of Murphy's law, or karma in some shape or form coming back to bite me in the ass for all the things I've done wrong. Hopefully after my brother and I replace the entire exhaust system, my pos will run efficiently. I can only hope that will be the case. 

So much has been going on in my mind, and sometimes I just wish there was something to cure the pain.  I'm usually a very happy go-lucky person, but there are times like the one I'm having now we're I just can't seem to let my optimistic side shine through.  In the end I know things will work out, they always do and today's problems don't seem so big tomorrow, but right now today's problems are stressful and worrisome enough. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone, I guess in a way we all are alone.  We are born that way, and we will all die that away: alone.  I feel as if I've been betrayed by some of the closest people to me, people whom I call my best friends. Those who I never expected to do me wrong.  The thing is even being taken for granted takes it's toll after awhile.  

What happens when u open yourself up to someone, tell them the stuff thats buried deep down within your soul only to realize in return that down the road it all doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter........ People move in, separate, go there different directions but what happens to the one who has opened their soul, their beloved heart to another? Should they forget and move on, or just be thankful for the experience in and of itself. In life, there are many questions with no answers. Perhaps this life isn't a place where we recieve the answers to our questions. Our own existence, our own reality maybe nothing more than a dream, an illusion. If this is such a case, if life is a dream.....then please wake me up......I'm so tired of wasting my life of having meaningless jobs, meaningless friendships, of having one person after another betray me.  

I'm tired of people not taking responsibility for their actions and feelings. What happens in life, happens for a reason. Though the reason may not be blatantly obvious there is still a reason for it. Blame it on free will, blame it on fate.......in the end it doesn't really matter........

What am I getting at? I don't know.......in fact I don't know a lot of things these days, and truthfully I'm okay with that. Ignorance sometimes is truly bliss. The less you know sometimes the better. Cause at least when u don't know, there will always be a glimmer of hope. And that's all I ask for these days...just a small glimmer of hope........that one day maybe not today, or next week but that I will serve a purpose, that the things that burden my soul and my heart will be released, and I can return back to being the optimistic Katie..."

I've been to Wal-mart four times in the past three days though two of those were because Kellie wanted me to take her there.  It also doesn't help when your broke, I guess that is what happens when you have a car. Your always broke.

It's so weird to finally have my own car, to do what I want to do when I want to do it. Yesterday I bought Blue from Blue's Clues and put him in my car as the car's mascot. haha. I also armoraled it, and vacummed it. Unfortunately, I don't have a radio in there yet, and it's driving me nuts. When I brought it home from Warren, I started humming just so there was some noise. Hopefully my bro and I will figure out something soon.

"event","It's 8am, and I still feel exhausted. Yesterday was probably the longest day of my life. I finally got the loser mobile on the road.  In order to do it thought there was way too much running from work to the bank to an independent insurance agent who were assholes to another bank to my house to buy insurance via the telephone, to Kwik Kopy to pick up the fax of my proof of insurance, then to the DMV to register the car and the running didn't stop there. 

Last night I had an emotionally taxing conversation with my mom. I don't know, I guess I just can't get what she said to me out of my mind.  There are times when I don't know what I want and they are just as hard on me as they are other people.  Sometimes I wish I could erase the past, it haunts my memories. I want to say that I've made all the right choices and decisions, but in all honesty that's impossible.  I'm not sure maybe I am starting to regret my former behavior..........

On a positive note, I hung out this past weekend with my best friend from high school. We ended up staying at her parents house, drinking alcohol with her mother (a little awkward at first since she's my second mom, but deemed okie doke after a little while or was that the alcohol talking).  It reminded me of ninth grade when I practically lived at her house, we were inseperable then. The good ole days......even then the drama didn't seem so bad. It's weird how two friends, two people, can not see each other for months and speak few words to one another in between encounters, yet when they see one another act like not even a day has passed by.  There aren't those awkward pauses because you begin to fill in where you last left off.  Reminisicing about high school, and our lil ""gang"" of friends definately made me miss everyone.  We'll definately have all changed, some for the good, some obviously for the not so good. It's hard to believe some of us are starting to get married, and are beginning to have children. Three years goes by so fast. I guess what I'm saying is damn...... What happenned to the crazy walks to church dinner, the midnight shopping at Wal-mart, our life stories (I'm not Auntie Poochie..long story)that hold not even a kernel of truth...... These are the ghosts of my memory..things that make me happy or sad depending on the day. 

I know quite a few friends are going through some rough periods in their life, and I just wanted to let people know that if you ever need someone to talk to, to just listen,  let me know. I'll be there for you anyway I can."

"event","Overall I had a great weekend. My best friend from high school, we'll just call her C for short, came home for the weekend. We ended up chilling at Burger King friday night with sis and Tia catching up on the old gang and who was doing what. I kind of feel a little bad the two of us weren't as close as we used to be, and though it may not be fair I blame that on her fiancee. For reasons that can't be explained in here nor do I want to go into details, he has a problem with me. Oh well, it's not for him to judge me and what I do with my life. Nor is it up to anyone else either. I'm a firm believer that there is only one true judge and his name is God. Leave the judging up to him. 

Anyways on Saturday night we ended up going to Applebees, and talked more about what's going on in our lives. The more we talked and the more we hung out the more it seemed like no time had passed since we had hung out like this. 

I ended up spending the night over at her parents house in Kennedy. It was a little awkward to drink with her mom at first since we decided to bring alcohol back with us, but after while it just seemed like the way things used to be in high school when her family ""adopted"" me as a surrogate daughter of sorts. 

It's crazy to see how her room which used to be painted with dolphins has now been replaced by that of a jungle theme loved by her younger brother, Creigh.  I remember when he was still little, and he used to give everyone corndogs. For those of you who didn't grow up here in BFE, corndogs are when you go behind someone and kick someone in the butt really hard while yelling corndog! Don't ask how this got started but I'm sure it was on one of our many crazy adventures to church dinner in Ellington.. Ahh the good ole days..haha.   

I didn't end up going to bed that night till 5am, and got up the Sunday morning at 9:30 so I could go home and get ready for work. Since everyone is quitting US NEWS, I work one day a week down on the third street. Needless to say, it's not my favorite place to be, but at least this time I didn't break anything..haha. I swear that store has it out for me. 

So I guess that brings me to current moment. I get to go put my prized ""losermobile"" on the road. YAY! and no Joe I'm not going to say I have *****. (Inside joke) Hopefully I have enough money when I'm done to put gas in it.."

I might be finally getting a second job! It would be from 5am to 10am.  The manager called me yesterday when I was at my other job, and left me a message to call her sometime today. I figure I'll probably end up calling at 9:30.  Wish me luck y'all! If I get this job I should be working anywhere from 50-60 hours a week. Not to bad, I need the money for when I move back to Oswego for the fall semester. I still haven't figured out though how I'm going to pay for my textbooks yet. I guess I'll just figure it out when the time comes. 

Only a few more days until I get my car on the road. I'm so excited. I've waited so long to have my own car, and now its finally mine. I'm still checking for auto insurance quotes, so if anyone knows a good company let me know. And oh yeah I can't save hundreds of dollars on my auto insurance with geico. Hehe. Progressive is cheaper :P 

Last night I hung out with one of my sis's. It was fun to wander around Wally World, and then sit up in Allen Park and talk. She brought up a good point that this semester she sometimes felt like she didn't even know me. To be honest I think there were times this past semester when I wasn't even sure who I was. Some of my behavior, well it left a lot to be desired. I guess I've learned not to regret what is in the past, it makes you who you are, but given the chance I might have decided to do things differently. I don't know its hard to explain this semester...definately hard to explain....."

I woke up at three a.m. took my blankets and pillows and camped out on the living room floor. It was way too hot and humid in my room. I spent most of the night blowing my nose instead of sleeping, have to love it when that happens.  The worse part is today starts my long week of work.

"event","I finally decided that I should add something to my LJ instead of just putting the quizzes in there. Not to much in new in the life of this oswego blonde. I'm finally getting my loser mobile, I'm just waiting for the title to appear. The addition of a new car means that I need to get a second job- yay my summer is looking more fun already. It's nice to hang out with my good ole peeps, and I'm looking forward to seeing Cassie and Jessica soon. It's been too damn long. I haven't seen Jess in two years...we're going to have such a blast when I visit her at Cedar Point. I should have tried to get a job there, or at least applied to melodramatics-US NEWS gets monotonous sometimes. It's a job though and I obviously can use the money.  Well back to watching Room Raiders I go or take a nap in the sun, either one sounds great now. I'll try to make entries more often.....

Love y'all and hope your enjoying your ""summer""!"

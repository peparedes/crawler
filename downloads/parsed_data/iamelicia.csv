"event","Well i didnt wake up til 2 today because of opeing out and being up til like 4 am. Oh well it was nice so thats all that matters. Then boy wanted me over super fast so he didnt have to eat alone and smoke alone. hehe. so i headed to blockbuster to use my last day of unlimited movies and got may and levity, to my dismay they both sucked and now i am no longer allowed to rent movies by my lonesome. IT started to rain so we decided to go take a walk by the canal and smoke. It was fun because i got to say moo to my friend lilly the cow, she rocks. We decided to spice up our love life and do it outside in teh rain under the gazebo. it doesnt work too well with jeans on and not being abl eto get a comfortable position, but i still liked it because it was daaaangerous. then we headed back and goofed and splashed eachother.

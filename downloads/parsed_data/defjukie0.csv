Something weird did happen yesterday though. I was at work, very busy may i add, and got a call from some guy. I answer the phone as im supposed to, ""Thank you for calling EBGames, your Nintendo headquarters. This is ed, how may i help you?"". The guy on the other line says something about, ""Blah-blah wanted me to call and tell you that he/she now lives in Canton and wanted me to give you their new phone and e-mail address"". Me being so busy, i say, ""ok, what is it?"" I take it down, and finish the call. The weird thing is.. i dont know who it was that i talked to and about who lol :\ Maybe i'll send an e-mail and ask who it is or something :P 
Well, thats all for now.

P.S. 9 days left :P"

"event","I bought an X-Box the other day. I figured i might as well now while i have the money, instead of waiting for November when Halo 2 comes out. :) I also picked up a new game called Fable, which is an awesome game if i may say so. In Fable, you basically play a character from early age til old age. Its really neat. Anything you do in your life will determine whether you become good or evil. My character is of course.. good :) You can do everything from steal from a house to killing townfolk. Funny thing is, if you kill a townsfolk, their house goes on sale. So if you had alot of money and wanted your own town, you could easily kill everyone in it and buy up all the houses. Hmm.. cool idea, might have to try it. o.O;

Today i leave for Atlanta!!! w00t!!! I will be gone all weekend to attend the Nopi Nationals, a huge car show basically. So i will update once i get back and maybe put some pics up if i can figure out how to do that on here. -_-; 

Well, thats all now for. Later!   -LiveJournal N00b  ;P"

"event","First off.. I was supposed to go see Resident Evil: Apocalypse with a group of friends like Porta and Taylor (old Assistant when i was managaing Gamestop) and others. Well, none of them called me back yesterday.. i feel so loved lol ;P

I will be gone this next weekend. I am going to Nopi Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia! :) Should be lots of fun; lots of cars, people, girls.. girls.. and i think cars too.. >.>;;  lol Anyway, I am going with Matthews, he will be driving us down because he is showing his car there for competition. It's been a while since i've left this state @_@; It'll be good :)

Speaking of leaving the state, i super forgot that my parents were leaving this wednesday to go to Las Vegas ;P They went to celebrate their wedding anniversary (which i think is the 22nd though >.>;) So, i hope they have a good time and are safe.

Man, there is something wrong with my back ; ; It wont stop hurting!!! Its only a spot under my shoulder blade ; ; Help me... its annoying and i'm gonna have to deal with it while i'm at work tonight. ; ; I hope i make it.

Well, thats all i had for right now. Take care. :)"

"event","This weekend was long, since i had to work :\ But thats ok, because for some reason, i really like going to work right now :) You'd think i'd be like, ""ehh"" since its the same thing i was doing when i was at Gamestop. I dont know, it just seems different this time. o.O; I know seeing alot of old faces helped out a little. I keep seeing people i havent seen in a while too. :) Anyway, just wanted to throw in a little something about work and real life. 

On to the nerdy stuff.  ;P

Lets see, tonight Porta came over to chill. He played a game called Front Mission 4, while i played the ever addicting Final Fantasy XI. I was a level 40 Ranger until tonight, I reached level 41! :D pretty exciting *nerdy snort laugh* ;P Pretty much heres a quick run down of Final Fantasy XI for those who dont care and dont know.
Final Fantasy XI is known as a M.M.O.R.P.G., have i lost you yet? good! ;D It stands for Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. Basically, Its kind of like that online Family Feud game. Only in this game, you can interract with other people. You create character when you start the game and choose your job to begin with. There are 5 races in this game: Humes (humans), Galka (bear like race), Taru (koala looking race), Mithra (cat chicks basically) and Elvaan. I am an elvaan male! My job in the game is a Ranger (like Aragorn) only not exactly. Basically my main weapon is a bow.  I'll post a pic of my character here soon once i get this journal spruced up. ahh crap.. im gettin sleepy.. >.>;; sorry. Anyway, i'll explain more about my character next time i update. If i ever do again that is ;P"

"event","Taking that first step is always so hard.. no matter what it is. In this case its very difficult because i've spent the last who-knows how many months literally sitting in my house. I try to throw the blame at the lateness of the job i was supposed to have 4 months ago or so.. but it's really all my fault. (;-_-) <-- frustrated, sad face. 
I was given a phone number to call to enquier about employment.. but.. i dont wanna..  (;-_-)
Part of me wants to wait til the 1st of August when i start at Electronic's Boutique (yes, really this time), but for the situation at the household, i am not able to sit around and wait anymore.. i feel so worthless. (;-_-)
Yes, i am scheduled to start on August 1st at Electronic's Boutique in Eastgate. Position: Assistant Manager. I think i will be there for 2 weeks or so, then Scott and I will head to our new store in Forest Fair Mall. Visits would be greatly appreciated, eventhough i haven't done that myself.
Yes i am nervous to work at a videogame company after what happened at the last one, especially going back as management. I just hope it all goes well.

I could not figure out how to make it playable on winamp and such. I always fail to look at everything, especially little buttons that say ""render to mp3"" :p 

If anyone would like to hear this crazy thing that i have concocted, message me. You know how to find me..

"event","Today was a good day... We had roughly 5 inches of snow fall today. It was beautiful. I am a sucker for cold weather, especially snow! Its funny how much my day became better once this hazardous weather came along. Weird. 

Well, a couple posts ago I mentioned an interest in purchasing an MP3 player. Today, i achieved that goal! Thanks to my friend FurY, i attained a Nomad Zen Xtra for a mere 200 dollas! I'd like to thank my X-box for sacrificing itself for this cause.. thanks Box! :P  
Thats right, folks! I now own a sweet ass mp3 player. It has 30Gb of storage (thats a damn lot!!) space. He also threw in some nice ass Sony headphones! The kind that attach to your ear. I love those!

Back to the snow.. I had to drive in it in order to get my Zen. It wasnt something i wanted to do at first. In fact, i had cancelled plans with FurY on the purchase because of the weather. YEAH! Like that lasted long.. lol! I decided i was too impatient to wait until tomorow to pick it up. I went ahead and threw on my hoodie, my issued C.I.A. beanie, and my coat, and out i went into the snowy ruckus!
The roads were full of snow, my cars TCS (Traction Control System) did a great job of deterring me from sliding into anything. 
I must say, the drive up to his house was great... lots of snow, zero visibilty, making your own lane in the highway... FREEDOM!! :P 
I had a Hummer behind me in the highway, and i thought to myself, ""Your ass needs to get in front of me and make a path for me! Bigguns!!"" 
Also, there was a Ford Contour that was coming up on my 6 pretty quick, and moved to the next lane at the last second. I look into the car.. and yeah! Some mexicans rollin on by! They were probably really excited to see snow.. (Mexico gets 0 snow) lol!

All in all, it was a good day. I really thought it wouldnt go well, since i did miss church today :( Much to my surprise.. 
 Laterz!"

"event","My parents asked me a couple of days ago if I wanted to go on vacation with them to Las Vegas. Of course, i agreed as long as my brother went also. I'm gonna need a chill buddy the whole week. I'm excited!! I can't wait!! We leave on February 22nd and we'll return on the 29th. We will be driving to California also, which is where most of our family is. My moms birthday falls on the 26th, so i'm hoping that we get to celebrate it with the fam. I'm also really looking forward to seeing my grandma again. I miss her. We also planned on going skiing! AHHH!! It's been way too long, hopefully the skill is still there. We'll even get to see our other house... oooh!! It's gonna be great!

With this trip that we're taking, I'm definitely insuring that i not get bored at all throughout the week. One definite anti-boredom technique that i will need to implement will be... you guessed it! Music! I have a cd player i could bring with me... but! that would mean lugging around a cd book, and i have a massive amount of cd's. My minidisc player wont help either because i'd have to find a way to carry the minidiscs. Last resort: an MP3 player! Yup thats right! I need one of those bad boys! I have till the week of our trip to save up enough money to buy one. That means 230-300 dollars. Pssshhhh!!! I got a long way to go!!   :P

Speaking of music... I installed a music making program called Fruity Loops. It's a pretty fun program to use. You take all these sound or intrument samples and place them where you want them, in hopes to make a dope beat! I'll definitely have fun with this. Who knows, maybe i'll get good enough and make a cd!! LOL!!!! *dreaming*

"event","I got overly excited today when i went to my music search site artistdirect.com and saw that El-P, leader of the hip hop army known as Definitive Jux, was releasing a new album called High Water. Too bad it was really a reservation for its release on March 9th. We just entered 2004 and i already want to fast forward over to march... hmm.

I recently infected this really cute girl with the Jasc virus.. lol! :P I acquired a copy of Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8, and I installed it on her PC. Now she can't stop making animated icons using Jasc Animation Shop (which comes with Paint Shop). She luckily stopped tonight, only to go to a party. Maybe there is a cure? :P 
Here is a sample of her creative skills at work
<img src=""http://pictures.greatestjournal.com/userimg/289199/123132"" />  
Too bad its not animating for some reason  :\

I spent the day playing Legend of Mana for the playstation. 7 hours 43 minutes is what i put into it today lol!! Of course, thats nothing compared to what I put on Final Fantasy Tactics advance. I started the game when I bought it, and put about 20 hours into it. I stopped playing it for a couple of months. I picked it back up a week and half ago, and in the span of 5 days, i went from 22 hours to 94 hours!! LMAO!! Thats 72 hours of play time I put into it!! wow!! Talk about not having a life!! oh well... 

Well, its 5 in the morning and i need to rest...."

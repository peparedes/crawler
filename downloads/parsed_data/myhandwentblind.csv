"event","I'm going to try to create a cohesive short story with Daniel and Caleb. (Crazy, I know.  I'm kind of famous for Not Finishing Things.)<br /><br />So I'm posting any remaining pieces under a <b>small filter </b>consisting of the people who have been commenting/reading and helping me with direction and criticism.  If you feel like you should be on that filter and I've missed you, please drop me a comment and let me know."

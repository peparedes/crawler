<lj-cut text=""redesigns of characters you probably never saw before. :P"">
It's sad that the whole reason I wanted to remake the two was for Rilwur, but Paraphi actually got an upgrade and made more of a character.
Figures. D:

I should really stop using the time waiting for sleeping meds to work as drawing time.  It always comes out... wierd.  I think I was trying to do perspective, but it's all tangly and I can't tell. XD;  Still have no idea what to do for shoes, hardest part of design for me.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Art/RiPaDesign0.png"">

Then I actually did a short lookup on real mongoose markings.  It seems that Mongeese actually have the same wierd eyes that goats do.  (Couldn't help but wonder how OC would think of that, her hating on Mina and all.)  And long pointy muzzle.  It's awquard.  Her hair is about where I want it, frazzly, but pinned up nicely at the same time.
The uniform design for Celestial Enforces hasn't changed, I just got better at drawing it. :P
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Art/RiPaDesign1.png"">

PARAPHI.  Had to come up with something for his head since it was just kind of ""*facepalm* He's a snake, he wouldn't have -hair-.""  The draped cloth came from staring at the Mass Effect art book, then worked out from there.  Desert-y snake, nomadic, hates the snot out of anything dealing with angels or demons (celestic).  That's just a fun idea, having the same fervor that our religions have for some god's cause, but to get rid of whatever that will is instead.
Haven't picked out his markings yet, but it'll be likely very simple, but having the cloth be complex.  Paraphi is notably younger than Rilwur, and he's a bit more oblivious when not in combat mentality. 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Art/RiPaDesign2.png"">
</lj-cut>

Myes.  And the whole reason to start was Nemesis by VNV Nation.  As I had hoped for new music, inspiration was nice. The phrase ""Judgement day's not coming soon enough"" is just so fitting for the focus of the Celestial Enforcers."

Lessie what's special about this collection.  I believe it's the first uploaded picture of my semi-universal ZOMGHUMAN character, Teca.  Hrebik is the Captain, he let me make a fursona for him. ^^;;
It's mostly in chronological order, save for the very last one of the creature which was done before the Battery and Teca set.

And that full body picture of Huegitu is craaaap. ;--;

Just some messing around in colors.  From a batch of scans to finish out '07 with, but most were crap so you don't have to burn your eyes with them. :D
Well, maybe I'll resize the one's that involve other people's characters so Photobucket won't explode.

Yeah, ITSY BITSY resize as photobucket is picky on filesize and all other compression options imploded from the gradient.  Took a second screenshot and just cropped out some of the fun bit so I could keep it uncompressed.  

I liked the way I remade the bullet holes, and now a really simplistic design.  (Though those green line vectors took almost an hour to do...)  When all is said and done, the stylized stuff doesn't fit either.  Be nicer if he was actually standing on something...  May redo it again when I feel like messing around with layers and effects some more.  Didn't get my blood spatter idea to work either, doing it with a straight mouse is dificil.  (No, I'm not going to use brushes.  I'll use them when I can do them myself first.)

Mreh.  At least I have something considerably less freaky than my previous two wallpapers:

The pose just begged to be done as I was listening to dis song. *points upwards* Slate, one of the two main characters of Tyler's.  Originally a faint blue pencil sketch with fine inking on the edges and filled in with a brush pen.  Just kinda had the need for a lot of ink, ya? 
As a stand alone piece in the sketchbook, I love it.  It was fun to work on and it looks nice.  CG, not so much.  Just screwing around with brushes and effects and junk.  Logging how I did the 'splosion clouds and jet trails, the rest is pretty bleh.
Kinda said I'd make a wallpaper from it, so I'll be remaking the background soon.  Definitely going to shoot for lighter colors, all too much dark with not enough contrast on this try.  Blood spatters are corny, yeah, but I'd like to get them right. Not going to change the inkwork as I am super happy with it.

Arg, it's such a nice drawing, but I can't get decent color on it as it's on notebook papers. 3:  All that decent blending shading just stuck there.
MUSCLE ARMS, but pretty frail and whispy otherwise, makes sense so he can actually fly with less handwaving than other characters. :| Tie-around shirt for that reason too, bah I put too much thought into everything as I go. (...do need to sit and rethink the arm's bone structure though, I know what I want and how but haven't gotten the layout set up.)

Yes, I fail at 'real' CGing because I do everything piecewise instead of painting it all at once.  Pretty much a request for a not-so-creative forumer to make a fursona for him.  He -insisted- that he have a gun, and gave a list of rifles.  Ulg, that M4 has been the bane of my existance because it doesn't look right if you simplify it in any way. I traced it over three times, so it's pretty much a cop out.

And now 11 layers, all the color frames down.  Not the final colors yet, but woo I just lock transparency and fiddle around from here. Hard part is over. :D

Yes, I can readily admit I'm not the skinniest thing in the world. Chub comes and goes, still at a healthy body-fat ratio. *shrug* There were many other pictures taken that day, but I didn't want to overload the entry so I'll split 'em up based on the type of pose. :3

Had I more control of the mouse, I would have shot a bit more for sketching out the rail I'm leaning on as well, as I know that's a rough part to draw, as a matter of perspective at least.  Still think this is a better way to step up the differences between random photos and drawing the poses in them.

Meant to be a profile sort of dealie, each one is sitting on the same shape of 'bench', I are lazy and no draw it, dur hur.
Even more durhur is the misspellings. Ha ha, I misspelt Terrorist.


Alright, and aside from just commenting on the pictures, I cracked up the contrast on these to make them a bit clearer on the monitor. Like to know if it works alright, seems a bit apprasive to me but the planning picture was practicly invisible beforehand. x.x</lj-cut>"

Ok, here we go.  Just some shots I selected out of the bunch that I really liked...  I didn't really notice I was exposing so much leg, but the curves show through fine and it's not showing too much.

Really really enjoy that dress.  Got it for thirty bucks at our local oriental shop a good year and a half ago.

First up, we have Crossword.  She came about completely from Calli's recent character design (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/46752133/), in which one of the spots on the tail looked like a puzzle piece.  Ideas landslide from there. ^^;  Tends to be that way.  Best part about her focus on 'puzzling' things is that she's very open and has no dirty secrets.  In ur face, cliches!

Also, she's going to be the secretary/public relations person for Nothing To Hide.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/003-Chimera.png"">
First round of ideas for Ryan's Self-insert chimera idea.  Clouded Leopard and Fennec for the main heads, some reptile for the tail. Really like the idea of the Fennec (who is devoid of markings, naturally) to have the mole on the cheek like Ryan does, I've always forgotten that in his pictors.

Round two.  Still very fun.  Elbow wing was very fun to do, he requested some scale detail for the elbows and I added a bit more.

Yeah, I put in the shadow eye on the computer, I couldn't resist it.  Don't really want to color everything because I think it would take away from the linework.  It's really nice on it's own, even through I do see a few flaws I made.

Took many hours to fiddle with the linewieghts like that, but it came out nifty.

And, again, I do not support drug use.  It's showing her character as a manipulative drug dealer.

DA is terrible at uploading the images now.  I gave it eight tries and I think I'm just going to give up until the next buld actually works.</lj-cut>"

I'll title it ""Just let the machine get it""
Dedicated to Assemblage 23's song 30KFT.  The most powerful song I have ever heard.  Put(ting) lots of thought and ideas to make it a very simple middle-class family.  I've wanted to do an image that would do some justice to this song, it's amazingly beautiful if very very painful.

On a less induced scale, Kate. Our little shadow character likes to play the drug dealer to bring people to their wit's end easily and quickly.  This drawing was meant more to show her personality, classy but still digging into the darker parts of society. Inking project for some techniques one of the guys at the new forum and I were talking about.  It'll be a while before it's done. The showing part of her Shadow 'side' is pretty fun too.  (Though technically she's always a Shadow, just disgusing herself the majority of the time.)

No I do not endorse drug use in any non-medical way. -.-;

Fun stuff. *returns to coloring fursona sketches*</lj-cut>"

Wold O'Donnell nodding off a bit.  No, he won't be staying naked, but I may not give him a shirt since his chest came out alright.  Trying to get better with beffy-ness, does look a little wonky.

'Kursed', Krystal when she abandons all her life and becomes a bounty hunter.  I rembered the top, but not so much of the bottom she had.  Refrenceless, I continued to sketch anyways.  I should go back and look at the picture before I fool around with the design much more. I liked toying around with the ideas, but I like doing that most of the time anyways. :D  Also, Flaco being a parrot for Wolf, eyepatch -> pirate :D (Though I play with it more as an implant at this point but~)

I suck at drawing guns!  Woo!

Some more Wolf, because he's very awesome.  I've concluded that he's an insomniac, poor guy.  I have ideas to write a quick little adapt of when Krystal joins StarWolf, so some ideas float around.

Unfortunately, the PMS thing does prove true but for me. During theese generally sucky weeks, I tend to flow back and forth between giddiness and depression.  This was obviously during the latter, but a question came through my mind as I was was thinking back to all my instances (while pondering going to a psychologist or not).

I do not wish to get some pity posts, let alone any advice on the matter presented.  I did this picture to show my contemplation, and for a fairly quick drawing it came out decently.

Also could be used as a bit of refrence for the TMI comic, but that requires more practice I'm not willing/able to do now.</lj-cut>"

First we have a mini comic featuring Slate and Wolf, used this to keep my spirits up and people were wondering why I was quietly laughing to myself. Oh well.  Oh, and some guy in my class did the thing in the corner, don't know what's up with that.

So, last night I was wiki-ing StarFox and talking about stuff with Tyler.  And it was awesome thinking about all the little details I had never really cared about.  Also, I read through the whole of the StarFox comics that were in Nintendo Power for... I think '92.  I may go back and read the '97 and '02 ones sometime.  It was intriguing.

And I was like ""<b>BITCH</b> I can do an awesome Vixy Reinard!"" Thus a family portrait came up in my mind.

James and Vixy, with a kid-Fox.  I find it very interesting that they were never married. The muzzles look so damn good!  And Fox is chubby like a real tot would be!

OMG it makes me happy!  I want to clean it up more, maybe shade it and color it!  IT WILL BE AWESOME.

Shanir Toqan is my armadillo babeh.  Considering he was never really made to be anything, he's pretty much defined himself.  Don't take no shit!  It's hard to draw angry, at least for me.

Yes, I do want to do a comic with Tyler and I.  It'd be a good way to counter what every damn porn thing seems to think about relationships involving sex.  Obviously just a concept for a logo-y thing.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Sketchdump4.png"">
Still today.  Some semi-depressing stuff, but not overbearingly so.  And some random try-out stuff.

Some might have seen the minis on DA, but it was originally just Joslyn there.  The two are in no way related.  Joslyn was calming explaining why she just doesn't like males. Sha came out quite well.  The mini Slate and Blade was from the conversation with Tyler about the picture. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Sketchdump7.jpg"">

Lust and Pride, he apparently came in just a short bit ago.  There are some sin character notes underneath, but they're fairly unimportant.

Layout idea, inspired by Own Little World by Celldweller.  Love that song to pieces.  Having the Saviors to work with makes it interesting.  Wings FTW.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Sketchdump20.jpg"">
A profile thingy for Still Light.  The profile styler for al the members of Nothing To Hide screeched to a halt after the first.  Such a bugger when that happens.  But <3 to markings.

Joslyn, saluting.  An attempt to draw from two perspectives simultanously.  It was all kninds of awquard.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Sketchdump23.jpg"">
Possibly a first comic for TMI, at least concept-wise. I'd probably redraw it to some format. Again, bad panneling.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Sketchdump24.jpg"">
Full page of stuff.  The model things are for Tyler, since he's playing around with 3D programs and he wasn't to model some stuff that I make.  Also, fiddling with Tyler's design.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/Sketchdump25.jpg"">
And to finish off, bringing us about the same place as the last dump, is Xauna.  Fiddled with the goggle design and used a bit more off-hand cat speices to have fluffies.  Because I'm a fan of fluffies and I think it adds an interesting aspect.  Didn't mess with markings though, didn't want to get into that area of trouble.

It's fun trying to get pirate themed (or at least semi-weaworthy) stuff to focus on aspects of the sins.  Pride was easy, military is loaded with pride/honor.  Tyler easily fits into Pride, he does get huffy about insults to his family.  And murderous to anyone hurting his family.  Sloth, just got sloppy.  Evan makes a good Sloth, though he doesn't want to admit it.  He'd never be able to move if he got a Gameboy and we all know it. :P


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Temika_works/PirateWrathGluttony10-26-06.png"">
Wrath, Clint, ANGRY FRENCHMAN.  Dig the hat.  He's known for eating everything, so I tried to rip up the feather at the end and the ends of his clothes.  Clint is very much Wrath, if you know him you know it.  As for Gluttony over there, that was hard to come up with.  Adam is just a plain guy, so I guess enjoying life over doing much work can count as gluttony.  He gets some fancy, and apologies for making him short. Again.


And those questioning, Tyler is a wolf/jaguar hybrid, Evan is a grizzly bear, Clint is a raccoon, and Adam is a species of bird I made up based on his screenname. :D

Also, the symbols from the previous entry with Lust have been implemented here.  Symbols are fun, like signatures of doom.</lj-cut>"

Margarita FTW.  Yes, the members of our tightest-knit group have assigned ourselves as the seven drunken pirates of the seven deadly sins.  I'm lust, not just because I'm female but because I have huge sexual desire, as well as having a very passionate obsession with music.  I should probably tweak it and get some headphones in there to pull that point out.

Symbols were me just messing around.  I know I have the list wrong, because I was all ""Vanity, DUH"" so I have to rearrange it and get it right. ^_^;  Tyler's Pride, Clint is Wrath, I'm Lust, and Adam is Gluttony.  Evan doesn't know what he wants because he's so afraid to admit he's Sloth. :P  Have two slots open, because I persobnally think that only the people we'll still have close should be on it.  It's not all willy nilly.

Lots of interpretations from myself.  Started as a vent pic, then I attached a lot of meanings and it all worked out pretty darn well. Feel better, muchly.  Personally, this is the best between interpretation of feral and anthro I've seen.  My skill isn't so high, but most I've seen has leaned heavily to one or the other. This is nice and right inbetween.

Fur self, encompasing rage.  It's not real blood, they're markings that look quite like blood.  It's on purpose. there isn't much that isn't.  All the little bits have meaning, but no one wants to hear me drabble on about that.  If you ask, I will tell.

With shading, tried out something different.  Kept the two images seperate because you can't see the change in color on the stitches in this one. I really liked how I did the stitches, it's annoying how people just do black lines normally.

Connection running, It's fun to work with her rediculous leg joints. She and I both didn't want to remain in a sour mood, so she jumped in with a bunch of ideas.  Being sketchbook-less, I had to use a sheet of printer paper I had just bought a sheaf of.  Her head still looks odd to me, I might have it too big, but it seems too feline-like for her.  She's an ambiguous alien, dangit. D:

Mini-comic showing a bit of the Breakers.  Not quite sure why, but I think I got the idea down ok.  Thrown together, so I don't think it makes much sense on it's own.  Played around with trying to do a comic with a touch of perspective and interaction, but mostly for poses sake so the quality isn't up to snuff.

<img src=""http://zellchaver.myftp.org/TechCat/Drawings%202006/FullSketches/Self%2009-26-06.png"">
Pose sketch of my cat-self, running forward.  Perspective is a bitch with hands.
And I was running around my floor to make my bell tinkle and it was fun, kinda wanted to catch that emotion.

And some harder 'emo' stuff.  No, the picture of Evan-bear has nothing to do with my being upset, it was something he did and I wanted to do it for the comic I hope to piece together sometime. The 'lyrics' there aren't from a song.  Oftentimes I'll piece what's bothering me into a few condensed words.  Desusional hope that maybe I could use them as lyrics if I get to making my own music.  The eye and tattoo was me just letting my pencil make shapes.  Little doodle to the right is how I feel a lot of the time, when my friends are upset I'm the excessive-emotional sponge. (But I would never wish otherwise, I live to help people.  It just prevents me from being really happy until they get through.)

Yeah...  Doesn't mean crap in the long run, but I'm trying to shoo off whatever gets on my chest as soon as it gets there.</lj-cut>"

The difficult part about this one is the perspective, it's supposed to be a low perspective.  When I tried making the legs look longer it just kind of absorbed into the looseness that Sonic style is.

Also, I'm still shit at drawing guns, but they look ok like that.

Some of the details I tried to work in were making it look like he isn't -completely- badass, and that he had to fight to get whovever it was down.  Black eye, bruised cheek. Didn't want to tear or cut the pants, because in reality those wouldn't have an effect like that in a fist fight.  His bangs are all roughed up, and a bit of his spines too.  I may try to get dirt or little stones stuck between spine fibers, that would look good.

I'm curious if anyone has any insight for putting a dirt look on the pants. or how to adjust the ground/background to help with the perspective.</lj-cut>"

Happy looking Zell, kind of Gunman in idea didn't come though.  Too few details cept in injuries and song stuff.  Zell's eye.  Gunman!Vienle hating on herself, 'cause she does that to convince herself she's not insane.  Little pose sketch of a fetal position for Gunman!Vienle too.

Gunman!Vienle, as a wee tot with her dad.  Just threw some concepts in, I may define him more later if I want to.  Yes, she was shooting that young, it's rediculous.  I never finished dad's pants. :O

Obviously very conceptual/pose-setting, didn't clean it up since class ended. Gunman!Vienle's self-image.  This is kind of what she defaults to thinking of when someone calls her angel, because of what she has fractured memories of.  She think she's a demon because she kept running with one, though it was Zellchaver in her past life.

Onto the next class!  My attention span is short when it comes to doodling if I don't have music.  And here we have a bunch of dancing poses.  Twilight there looks like crap.  D:  Really like the view of Snazzard from the back, it's such a fun tail to work with!  Drawing from the back is a challenge, but it can be fun.  Top left: Battery, Top Right: Raikuei, Bottom Left: Joslyn Snazzard, Bottom Right: Twilight.

First doodle ended up starting up when my Electrical Engineering TA didn't show up and we were all waiting in the Recitation.  See a bit of Zell and Zell's demon in there too.

And then I went and took the ideas and defined them a bit more (And to reassure myself I could draw it again.. >.>;)

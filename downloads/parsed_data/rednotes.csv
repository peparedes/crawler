"event","as much as i have wanted this. is it worth it?
i havent cried like this is a while.
is it really worth it?
but on the other hand, can i really change anything?
everything would be better if he was here.
he would hold me and help me fix everything.
tell me tonight is enough. we'll deal with it in the morning.
then it'll all be okay.
everything makes more sense when he's here.
i miss him.
i wish he was here to help me through this.
i know i did too much today and trying to fix everything tonight is overwhelming me.
i need to stop.
but why wont it work?!
i need to stop, sleep and fix it tomorrow.
but im so scared of this.
i need his strength. 
i need his kisses.
i need him.
i miss him.
everything is 10x worse when your going through it alone.
when half of your heart and soul is 7000 miles away.
but knowing what he'd tell me gives me that faction of comfort to be able to sleep.
even though ive cried so hard i have a headache.
ill deal with it in the morning.
or next week.
ha.
if there is anything left.

"event","this has pretty much been the worse 2 weeks ever. everyday im getting 2-3 nose bleeds and headaches. i think ive cried every night over school. willow was sick so i got so scared cause i couldnt afford to take her to the vet. vincent needed his shots in feb, but again i cant afford to get them. my paychecks have been crap cause they cut hours so i cant even pay all of my bills wihout saving every penny. so i havent really eating too well. ive been trying to eat sandwiches and cereal for the past month, to save money. i havent gone out with friends cause if i do ill spend money. im burried in school work because im trying to work more and i freaking hate it. i hate school. i have no freaking clue what the hell im doing. im taking the advise of everyone around me instead of what i really want to do. NOTHING. i just want to be able to pay my bills and take care of my kitten and dog. 
its so frustrating cause ive applied to temple twice. once in spring 08, didnt get accepted. now im at cpp. so im like well maybe if i go to better school ill like it better. so i have applied to temple for fall 09. cpp is screwing this up for me. i had my transcripts sent back in January and they still havent gotten them. then i got another sent to me that took 2 weeks, then my mom opens them. great. more wasted money, cause they wont accept opened transcripts. so she offers to buy me new ones. so i get them rush sent to temple. they still dont have them. i just need an answer.
 what the hell am i doing.
i wanna know where im going. how to get there and what is my goal. i dont have any of them. i feel like im not good enough for anything out there. i always defeat myself before i try. and i let that comtrol me. i know im not good enough. why should i even try.
everyone says ill figure it out, that everything will be okay. but its hard to see the light when you are so covered up by fear and defeat that u dont even know if its day or night out.
im only in school because of matt and my mom. i dont even what to be there.
if only i could see the future id know what to be going towards.
or on a morbid note maybe i dont know what to do is because i dont have a future. as soon as i say that the people get worried. oh no shes got depression!!!! no its called not everyone is meant for college or has the money for it, leave me alone.

i dont know. i wish i had answers. where's my magic fairy.

haha current song is Going Away To College by Blink-182. Ironic... next!"

-----------------------------------
RANT:
i feel like im stuck. like not just cause of sweetie's death. but like with everything. i cant make up my mind. i applied to temple again. i had to write an essay. why do i want to go to temple. and it was like.. i dont want to go to temple. im only going because everyone i talk to says to go . its a good school it will help you alot. then it was like why are you in college? i dunno, im in college cause if i wasnt i would just be working. i dont  even want to go to college. i hate and and feel like its a waste of money. i dont even know what i want to do with my life. 
i also wish i wasnt so tied down.
i feel like if i wasnt tied down i would feel better about decisions i make. id go to school for archeology and i would just leave.go to school for something that would take me far far away to a place thats new and exciting. take the money im spending for college even and just buy a one way plane ticket to itay,ireland, japan or sicily. set up a whole new life there and have fun.
i hate this growing up stuff, none of its fun. i never have money for anything cause of car payments,  health insurance, car insurance, food, phone, dog and then just living. 
and then on top of those bills there are things that i need for school. like a stupid 100 dollar book im never going to need after that class.
wtf
i cant stand alot of things now.
---------------------------------- 
i was going to get a kitten from a girl i work with. but they all died. :(   so ima sad panda.
ive been trying to clean my desk off since school ending
but i keep putting things on it
troy keeps skipping over me, di
all he has are 17 mags and that will f-me up. so i have to wait for him to order new stuff plus i havent even seen the drawing yet
my car...ha! the sound system broke!!!!!!! im soo pissed.
oh did i say i miss sweetie.
money is always an issue
i cant pay for the chiro at all. but my neck is killing me and my wrist hurts sooo bad.
got vincent groomed cause he was so gross. but that was my money for the doc and my phone.
i think is the most ive even written besides the italy post.
and oh man
i miss italy so much. im also homesick."

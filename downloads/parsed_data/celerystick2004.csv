Sorta.

Today was everywhere, one minute everything is hilarious and the next everything just hits you. Sucks.

I slept in this morning, finally rolling out of bed in time to get to school for the Art Potfolio exam. While Melcher was flying around chasing her Applied Arts students I got out an art smock that I had decorated the night before with fabric paint. Everyone signed it and we presented it to her and yeah, she cried.

Yeah. Actually there was a lot of crying today. Everyone's final art composition was really... emotional. All of us really put some serious expression into our projects, whether we realized it at the time or not. It sorta brought out some of the stuff people have been dealing with lately.

And that's probably what got me into this melancholy mood. Thinking about how some of my friends go through so much pain, it really makes me sad. I always wish there is something more I can do, because sitting back and watching is the worst thing in the world for me.

Well, it wasn't a throughly depressing day. After Art Portfolio got out, me and Melissa were intending to head to Webb's for lunch. And halfway there, guess what. Yeah, me carrying my huge purse, yearbook, lots of junk AND a huge oil painting - It starts to POUR on us. We thought we could sprint to Webb's before it got bad. Oh no. We got a block before we were soaked. HAHAHA. So we laughed, took off our shoes and ran up and down the block with our faces towards the sky.

After a while the rain slowed down. We called Melissa's dad to pick us up. At her house we ate lunch and I dried my clothes.

Then it was back to school for everyone. Graduation practice was being held in the stuffy field house. We lined up, practiced plenty of ""square turns"" and standing up and sitting down and so forth. We received our caps and gowns and instructions of when and where and what to do. And all that fun.

And of course they showed the senior slide show. I didnt cry, it was mostly pictures of the same 10 girls in all the pictures. There were a few of me, Erica and Sabrina which I have no idea where they dug up from. But then, out of the blue, they showed this one picture of us kids, back in the day. We were at J. E. Jones Elementary, in fourth grade. It was one of the last days of the year, after they planted the memorial tree. And our little nine and ten-year selves had gather tiny pebbles under the tree to spell out the name: Jenny.

I know it all happened a long time ago, but that one really choked me up.

So yeah. I guess I'm done. I keep forgetting that school is out, I'm finished, I'm free. I just keep feeling like something is holding me back."

"event","Closet Classics. 1000 North Ave. Yellow 1950's Vintage Strapless Sun Dress. 

$12

Wow. I am speechless. :-D

Bodice is ribbed and fits *perfectly.* Skirt full from waist to knees. Has NO stains, but the fabric is wrinkled and there are two parts of the hem that are falling out. No biggie, I sent it to the dry cleaners and my dress will be cleaned and repaired for $6. To finish it off I am adding a broad white ribbon around the waist and a flower pin on the top left corner. Excellent.

So today was a good day. I started out the day by being yelled at by Mrs. W, about nothing (wow, big surprise). By third hour, I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean in AP English. Funny, am I the only one in the world who sees the unimaginative and predictable plot and lack of characterization in this movie? Probably.

So lunch. Haha. I love lunches this year, every day is crazy and hilarious. I am really going to miss these times. Going to Adamchkz for sandwiches. Paying in pennies at McDonalds. Sitting on the curb outside of Pick N Save, eating little loaves of bread. And then there's always the parking lot, which I am quite sure there is no equal in strange happenings. Good times.

Man I was getting all nostalgic today. I gave Cassi a ride home and we started talking about the infamous sophomore sleepovers. And when we used to all go to KMart and do crazy stuff because, in Cassi's words ""what else is there to do in Cudahy?"" And plus, what could be more fun than walking around with underwear over your clothes in the middle of a store?

Tehehe.

Okay so this weekend was weird. Me and Debbi went to go see HP3 on Friday. It was a good movie, not like Academy Award Nominee material, but better than the first two.

Saturday pretty much rocked. I got up and went to my summer volunteer orientation. Pretty much everyone from last summer was there so it was cool. I am SO PSYCHED! :-D

So Saturday afternoon I get the final word on the Chicago trip. Me and Debbi's moms talked and I found out that it is certain Debbi can't go. She has a military physical thing, which is very important, right in the middle of the planned Chicago trip. I am really bummed out right now about this. And because half the invited people can't come, I am sorta canceling it for now. Sadness. :(

Well Saturday night I was feeling really weird. Like bummed out by the Chicago thing, and excited for summer, and nostalgic about school ending, and anxious about college. So I did what I have not done in a long time. Threw on my roller blades and bladed out to the cemetery.

I bladed around for 'bout and hour and a half. Just had to clear my mind. I love being in this cemetery, 'cause in the city its the only actual quite you can find. And I forgot how great it is to blade. Can't believe that back in the day I was such a blader freak. Haha.

Man this post is just rambles. Sorry all. I gotta get off to somewhat prepare a speech on how a specific piece of literature influence my life. Adios."

"event","<u>my vintageous adventures</u>

yeah. so. Yesterday, my mom was all like ""let's go shopping."" This being an extremely rare thing coming from my mom, i quickly agreed and we went.

I told her that I wanted to look for a vintage dress for my graduation. I looked up some local vintage stores and found that there are several in M'waukee, mostly down on Brady Street. Sounded like a plan.

Woa.

Brady Street is like, so not M'waukee. Its extremely up-to-date, very boutique-tea house-used bookstore-vintagaeous sort of place. I mean, there were awesome little cafes with people outside at small rusty tables drinking lattes and angsty looking college guys sitting on orange crates singing the blues. IN M'WAUKEE?!?

Yes way.

Anyhoo, I explored (sort of in a daze) Dragonfly Vintage. Oh wow. I wanted to buy everything. But could not. Alas.

Oh yeah, funny story. I went to Brady Street originally to go to this shop called Closet Classics. On the internet it said it was on 932 E. Brady. It was no where to be found. I looked it up in the phone book, where a new address, over on Water St., was listed. After driving there we only found an empty building. So we gave up, drove back on North ave towards our house.

And guess what. We got lost on a back road and ran into ... Closet Classics. On 1000 North Ave. I was all like ""Yesss! Finally"" I jumped out of the car, ran to the door just in time for the employee inside to turn the locks and close the door. It was 7:02. Closed. Bummer.

Anyways. Today I continued my thrify-ness. After school I walked to Value Village and met up with Sami, Alely and Adrianna. Haha. Two of them had only been vintaging once before and Alely was a VVV (ask me about that one) So it was very funny.

Lets see. I walked away with a pretty good haul: 1 yellow ""ozone girl scouts camp"" tee, 1 blue ""milwaukee french immersion school"" tee, 1 purple ""PPT-the place to be"" tee, one old black pullover sweater and *giggle* 3 awesome-in-the-extreme button pins (""Educate, don't Alienate;"" ""Gordon Family Tree;"" and ""Homer cares about you!"")

Woa. I almost forgot about this. During 2nd hour Spanish class, me, Savannah and She'maiah (the only seniors in the class) all sat down when suddenly everyone was looking at us. Turns out all the sophomores and juniors in the class organized a surprise graduation fiesta thing-a-ma-bob for us. Weird. I mean it was really nice but I've barely talked to any of the people in that class all year. They all chipped in money to buy us presents, a card and an Dairy Queen Cake. Sweet deal I guess.

Whew. I'm tired. Ack I have four more days of being a senior. Then final exams, but I only have to come for 2 days of those. Wow.

Going to go see HP3 tomorrow. They got a new director, new screen play and new Dumbledore. Hmmm. We'll see.

EDIT: Oh yeah, I got my Art Splash photos back from Walgreens a few weeks ago. I actually got as far as scanning a few of them and uploading them to photobucket. Go take a <a href=""http://img53.photobucket.com/albums/v163/celessa/Photos/"" target=""newwindow"">looksie</a>. Oh yeah, I'll add more later, including the one of Jerry taking his eyebrows together."

"event","Woo. I'm beat. I'm sitting here all tired and cold-like with a runny nose. Not fun.

Yeesh. Friday was crazy. I woke up early, still feeling sick but I had to go to school for the award ceremony thing. So I get all fancied up in shoes a size too small, and my hair foofy in the extreme. And them I go to school and sit on stage with bout 30 others for the 2-hour ceremony. I received two awards and was feeling sorta spiffy and i just walked off stage when the choir teacher stopped me. ""You shouldn't have been chewing gum,"" she says. ""It looked really tacky and everyone could see it.""

We-elll. Talk about smashing you flat.

So after a wonderful *that was sarcastic* morning I was in a really bad mood. I had Jenny's party to go to and I was soo beyond tired. To add to that I was somehow losing my voice.

Haha. It actually didn't matter anyway. I had soooo much fun at Jenny's. After I got there, we (me, Jenny, Anna, Brandon and Kyle) all hung out for a while.

And then the Hughes arrived.

Dan, Samuel, Jon and Patrick. Josh and KT. And of course Abby. Haha. When they are all together it is a riot. They are an awesome set of people.

Well pretty soon we decided to take a little trip to the park a block away. Haha. I wore a vintage 60's long satin pink skirt. To the park. With my t-shirt and flipflops. And I climbed over a fence.

Oh man. I climbed halfway up the fence, lost my shoes. Started laughing so hard I almost fell off. Got halfway over and had a hysterical laughing fit because the skirt was snagged and I was stuck. HAHAHA. Well Josh came over and tried to lift me down. Abby was standing behind me laughing her head off and I was just like ""No no no."" Because I'm stubborn and wanted to get down by myself!

Well the rest of the evening was crazy. We actually went and played on the playground. Just like the old days. Haha. Good times.

I stayed over at Jenny's house Friday night and most of Saturday. Saturday morning me Jenny and Anna were bored so we decided to go shopping. LOL. The 99 Cents store. Good deals, man.

Okay. I hafta get off and actually do my Social Studies Project. And my Art History Project. Ugg. 7 more days."

"event","So today. Rushed as usually, with the normal amount of craziness and so forth.

And then the hair shin dig.

So I have been wanting to cut my hair, and to donate it to <a href=""http://www.locksoflove.org/"">Locks of Love</a>, since the beginning of the year. And then a few weeks ago Katrina was all like ""so do you wanna cut your hair for Locks of Love?"" Eh. Why not? 

By this afternoon, this thing had grown into a sorta major hair-cutting-donating-etc event. When I arrived at the designated room, about 20 people were standing around. Alothough only four girls were signed up to donate hair, I guess everyone wanted to watch. By the time everyone arrived (10 girls turned out to chop their hair) about 40 students, teachers, parents and total strangers had crowded into the small classroom to watch. I didn't think it was all that interesting to see, but just like everything else, Cudahy makes it into a sporting event. Upon each scissor snip, they broke out into cheers.

Anyway, after sitting in front of all these people and chopping my hair and receiving more cheers (did we make a touchdown or something?) I grabbed my bag and headed out. I told Debbi to pick me up at the corner of Somers and Lake Shore Drive and sure 'nough, she and Scott were waiting there for me.

So we pile in the car and drive across town to this place to get fitted for Johanna's 
wedding. Since the wedding is going to be medieval, we all get these renaissance-looking dresses and stuff. Its pretty crazy but it will be fun. Just ask Debbi what my role is. Haha.

After I get home, eat and go online I realize that I have to do something with my hair. Its really uneven. So I call up a near-by hair salon and look up bus routes. 'Cuz I'm a vehicle-less bum. Hehe. Anyway, after running across Capitol (four-way major road) to catch my bus I made it to Cost Cutters alive.

Hmm. I almost sorta liked my hair right after it was cut. It was really silky and crunky looking, but totally uneven. Now its shorter, poofy and wavy. No me gusta. Hopefully after I wash and dry and straighten it, it will be better.

We'll see."

I need to get moving and stop slacking off.

Weekend went by fast. Friday and Saturday were crazy. And then Sunday. Sundays always sorta catch me by surprise. Things catch up with my mind and I always start thinking too hard about things that hurt.

And then I realize that I'm almost crying in the back of the church on a Sunday.

Gotta stop doing that.

Well I have to get more stuff done. *Stares at wall for fifteen seconds without moving* Yes, ahem. I need. to get. stuff. done. *Still not moving.*

"event","Ack I am sooo tired. I woke up and it was 12:15. In the AFTERNOON. I have not slept in that long in about six years.

So we (we being me, Ryan, Scott and Debbi) all went out to go see Shrek 2 last night. That is an awesome movie. Haha I was just dying laughing. Tehehe. Those movies are major crazy and then they just get so random. (Umm make that tyzo!)

Anyways, we all went back to Debbi's place at like 11:00. Debbi has this weird game where you ask ""either or"" questions. For example, one question was: would you rather: a) drink the liquid out of a full garbage bag or b) chew on a hairy substance found in the couch. Well that was a pretty mild one. Haha. Wow. Things got interesting...

This afternoon after I returned home I went to WalMart with my mom. I bought a nice black and white striped sheer-ish shirt, some earrings, sunglasses and body spray. Yeesh. I just borrowed 20 bucks from her and now I spent another 20 bucks. Ack. I need to stop spending so much. I don't even have a job.

On a happier note, I finally turned in my job application! Yay! I'm (hopefully!) going to be a waitress at Mama's Italian Cuisine on Burleigh St. So if I get the job, and you happen to be on the northwest side of Milwaukee this summer, come and eat there (and leave me a big tip!) :-D

Oh wow. I totally forgot to start writing my graduation announecment letter thingers today. I need to write and send them all out to relatives in the hope that they will send presents in the form of cash. I am already behind on doing this. Ahh, manana.

I don't have much else to talk about. I hit up Value Village the other day (Friday?) and got some sweet pinstripe tailored-looking pants and a very 80's-licious skirt. Now I just need some pink ribbon and some stilettos and I'm good to go.

Later gator(s)."

"event","They found a body by the lake in back of Sheriden pond today. Its sorta unnerving. You hear all the creepy tales and urban legends and then something happens. Makes you feel much more aware and yet totally vulnerable.

My day was considerably happier than most, probably resulting from a wonderful discovery first hour that Mrs. W would not be at school today. I practically hugged the sub, I was so happy that Mrs. W *aka el dictator* was not there to criticize me. :-D

Hmmm. After taking a makeup test for Economics sixth hour ( I failed. Miserably :( ), I was in a really bad mood. So I went back to art class. I was just looking for a pencil when I noticed that someone had left a fundraiser bag of candy on my desk. Hmm. So of course I ate most of it. I left a note on the bag that said ""Thanks!"" So we'll see.

Jumping back to the weekend. Well I was sitting by my parents and some of their friends when they start talking about houses. I wasn't really listening until one of the family friends asks me when we were planning on moving. Obviously I realized I had missed something. Turns out my parents have been looking at a house in Cudahy and seem to have forgotten to tell me. Everyone else knew: my best friend, my neighbor, people at my church. Just not me. Figures.

So afterschool I finally got around to scanning some of my sketchbook! YES! I know, I can't believe it either. I went over to the Public library and used their scanner and here is the <a href=""http://img53.photobucket.com/albums/v163/celessa/Sketchbook/"" target=""newwindow"">results</a>.

Renaissance Awards ceremony tomorrow. 17 more days left of school. Wow.

EDIT: I changed the information of the ""body-finding"" business. She was in the lake, not the pond. And she was an old lady who had alzheimers. Sad."

I thought he would take it seriously. I guess not.

On questions such as ""How do you feel being at the top of your graduating class"" he wrote ""I feel like spaghetti."" Okay, I admit, it was funny at first everyone had a laugh, but then... I mean come on. This is the valedictorian. By the time he was done his answers included memoirs of Ms. OB as the most influential teacher (yeah right!), wishing he had walked to class backward everyday, and attributing his success to ""pure dumb luck.""

Whatever.

Lunch was minimal, because I only had 1.35 in change. I bought a can of V8 (yummy!) and a Milky Way, which probably overrode any healthiness from the V8.

Art Class included a (more than usual) crabby Melch, crabby Tasha and in general a lot of crabbiness. Me and Tasha continued our argument over which piece of art was older: The bust of Julius Caesar or the bust of Constantine. I told her Julius Caesar was older. I was right.

Hmm. Just checked my stocks. DFS stocks just went down by twenty five cents per share. Bummer."

"event","I actually stopped and counted the number of *normal* classes I've had during this week. The amount was somewhere around three or four. Weird.

So the shadowing thing didn't work. Waaa. :( But after I got to school, (late) I went to the office to drop off my bag of donations for the troops in Iraq. I found out that the secretaries were having this little drive to collect items to send to Ms. Pyzack (who normally is the school's speech teacher but has been sent off to Iraq) who will distribute them.

Well the little drive was no longer little. Word got out and people brought in TONS of stuff. It was very cool, so I got that little ""journalism scoop"" lightbulb go off in my brain. I ran and grabbed the camera and a notebook so I could jot down a few facts and quotes from the secretary. Regardless of what Ms. W thinks, I do work very hard in that class.

Because I am in a good mood, I am not even going to talk about how *She* sunk to a new low today in her never-ending psycho-ness. :-) See, I am totally getting off this subject now.

So yeah.

I went to a baseball game today! Woooo Brewers! Ahem. Well after getting there, we had to walk like forever just to get to the stadium. Lots of people. And while I was trying to find the right entrance to the stadium, I ran into Kevin! (?) Totally weird! And the strange what-are-you-doing-here sort of running-intos kept continuing. We then ran into this Shane guy who graduated from my school last year and has known my mom for a long time.

Woa. Speaking of weird stuff. I have been getting quite a few mysterious letters lately! Not all from one person either. Yesterday I got this letter from a little girl at the Spanish elementary school. Today I walked into my dad's shop and there was an envelope addressed to me with no return address on the door. Later I got a small hand-written envelope (again with no return address) in my mailbox. The address originally said Oak Creek but was crossed off with a magic marker and in its place Milwaukee was written.

Wow I just totally got off the topic! I am so random today. Anyhoo. Back to the game. After the third inning me and my sister went to go get food. Since it was ""Roll Back the Clock"" day, all the food was like super cheap. This little dude came out of the kitchen with a box full of dollar hotdogs and was like completely attacked by a mob of hungry people. Haha.

Anyway after 45 minutes in line for hot dogs and 3 innings later we came back to our seats. That was when this Shane guy, who I guess now works at Miller Park, came over to say hello. Well that was a long hello. He just kept hanging out there talking to us for the rest of the game. Hmmm. I didnt really know him that well so I didnt talk to him much. Plus I was busy trying to spot one of those cotton candy people.

Funny story. Well with all the crazy-ness and hungry people, there was like no food left. Me and my sister REALLY wanted cotton candy. So we started using some binoculars and scanning the crowd. We spotted a cotton candy dude like across the park and two levels down. We were so there. Hahaha We actually raced over there. After searching around for another 10 minutes we spotted her. This girl had like four candy things left and people were all calling out to buy 'em. So we almost attacked her in our mad attempt to secure our cotton candy. We fought this lady for the last two bags of it (the girl selling the candy looked ready to cry) but we got the Cotton Candy!!!

Hmmm. I meant to do a SHORT post. Did not happen again. I must work on this. Adios all.

P.S. People who read my journal (I know you exist somewhere!) please post a comment or something :-D It will make me happy. Yay!"

"event","So I'm sitting in first hour, watching the clock and praying that I can get out of that room before Mrs. W comes and starts to ""tear apart"" my layout once again. A few moments before that wonderful bell rings, the principal comes on the P.A. system and announces that there is a lockdown. No drill.

Well okay. Forget worries about possible bombs, gunmen or national emergency, I fear the thought of being stuck in a locked room with Mrs. W for two hours.

So we all go to the back back room, the tiny storage closet behind the dark room behind the storage closet behind the classroom. And wait. After about half an hour the P.A. system tells us to return to class and wait some more. The doors were still locked, so Mrs. W took the opportunity to come over and smash my happiness.

Her: ""Let's see that layout again."" *in nasally commanding voice*
Me (wearing bright chipper fake grin): ""Sure thing.""
Her (scrolls down pages of issue that has kept me ceaselessly occupied for two months): ""Yeah.. see this is exactly what I mean. This page is HORRIBLE! I can't stand it. It's just.. bad! And the graphics.. they are corny and don't make  any sense. I have told you before... and you should know how to do this by now.. Really, this is a sign of just sloppiness. I mean you should have caught this."" These are exact quotes.

Sadness.

Anyhoo. The rest of the day almost made up for that. We (meaning the Spanish Club)had a field trip! It was soo great, almost like old times. Me and Erilda sat reminiscing about Tennis stuff and good times. Made me sad to think that this may be the last field trip in an old yellow school bus with a crazy drive ever! *sniff* Ahh, memories.

Well we went to Jalepenco Loco for lunch. Then we headed over to the Spanish Immersion School to meet our third grade buddies. They were super hyper and funny. We all went outside and played a mad game of kickball. With us high schoolers playing against third-graders, the outcome seems obvious. They kicked our butts! 

Ahh to be in elementary school again. :)

Anyways, at about 3:00, after a cuh-razy ride back to school on the bus, I headed over to Value Village. And yes, the value in the Village WAS extreme. I ended up with a very cool haul: 1 pink/blue/green soccer jersey; 1 red softball tee, 1 green tee; two 80's-licious belts; a AQUA VINYL 70's clutch (I kid you not!), and... a pair or green and white stirrup legwarmers. Wow. I am speechless at the moment.

Okay I'm going to head over to Debbi's for a moment. She *may* be shadowing me tomorrow! HAHA We always joke that we would do this just for fun and now we actually might! LOL. We'll see by tomorrow if the new principal shall allow it. Toodles."

Me, in junkie mood, with tons of stuff to do in the lab and she wants to go and make me drop everything and make me go and stand in front of my little sister's artwork (its VERY good I know and I seriously like it but) and exclaim to everyone how lovely it is. After another ten people oggle it and wow it and so forth I just sorta creep outta there and wander around the school.

I am not jealous. Seriously, its not that. Its just... its like the whole me trying so hard at something and the whole perfection complex and then someone else comes and completely squashes you flat. Happens a lot and I need to start getting used to it.

Anyways. Second hour: spanish, third hour: ? (used to be AP English but is now a study hall) Studied a bit, talked about Pride and Prejudice, discussed Mr. Darcy.

Taco Bell for lunch. On the way there we talked about the stereotypical lower-income hispanic peoples. Ahem. I know I am a hypocrite. Me talking about how people should never refer to others by their ""ethnic backgrounds"" And here I was talking about Mexican guys with junkie cars and fancy rims. And just as I was feeling guilty, a large junkie car with fancy rims drives past with a VERY loud bass system. Yeah.

While I was having an okay day, Mrs. Melcher apparently found the whole last twenty-four hours leading up to this AP Art History exam more difficult than (and I quote) ""giving birth."" Well, I have no idea what she was talking about. (And I have also never personally delivered a baby) Other than 115 really some-what disheartening multiple choice questions, the ten (yes I said ten) essays went fine.

After school I went and got my new CD at Breakwater, went to Walmart (the ghetto one where Capitol Court mall used to be) stood in the returns line for half an hour, bought new ear buds, and went home.

After a bit I went and watched The Color Purple at Debbi's house. Its a good movie and very sad. I actually read the book before I saw the movie (Yes I am not normal!) Now I'm sitting here, listening to music and wishing I did not eat Taco Bell. Ugg.

Oye, voy a ir al restaurante de Jalepeno Loco manana. No mas comida Mexicana! Uggggg."

"event","Haha. Nice title. I actually did stop and smell the flowers. Then I sneezed.

Anyhoo. This week is DONE. As I said last night. It is FINISHED!

Okay. A summary of the last two days.

Wednesday night. Night before the AP test. I freaked out and just started surfing random websites trying to avoid studying. I eventually got down to skimming a little Hamlet and Oedipus, but then I decided sleep was a better idea.

Thursday morning. Woke up at 4:45 (AM!) got ready, left house at 6:00. Helped out at NHS teacher appreciation breakfast thinger, grabbed some pens, and ran (literally) to the testing room and barely made it on time.

AP TEST (am bound legally by law not to discuss this. Whatever its all a blur to me anyhoo)

Four Hours later. We all walked, blurry-eyed, out to the parking lot. Climbed into Sabrina's (borrowed) car and drove over to ""that Gyro place"" Ordered food, vegged out in restaurant booth for 45 minutes. Then drove on a few errands and went back to school after nice hour and a half extended lunch.

At school. I spent the rest of 6th and 7th hours preparing for the art show. The fog of AP-testing-ness finally lifted and I was all psyched to finally be a senior portfolio member :)

After school. Me and Erica hitch a ride with her parentals. Me go over to the local Catholic elementary school and consult a nun about some old carnival games and such. Besides gaining a disturbing looking elephant ring toss thing, we also added to the collection a large ""Bunko"" game. Which the nun said she forgot how to play, so 
no one knows how to play. Ah well.

At Ericas. So we go and chill by Ericas house. She lends me awesome VV clothing and her mom does my hair. These guys are the most awesomest people. Can't believe I've known them like 11 years. Crazy.

In Van. So we get the ""Zawacki-moblie"" and head on down to get Tim, her brother. After picking him up we grab some pizzas from Cassi's work and go home and eat 'em. Then we (Jake, Tim, me and Erica) head out to go pick up Alely. After searching for a green house like forever (there are a LOT of green houses!) we finally find her and get to the high school in time to ""meet the crowd"" (not)

At school *again*. So we (meaning portfolio) get all settled and start artin' Halfway through the show all these little kids started pouring in. It was so funny to see them in the art room and all and watch the other portfolio persons telling them about art. Haha.

At school *cont'd*. So yeah. And all these old portfolio persons showed up! I mean it was crazy. Jenny, Brian, etc. I always feel like I'm encroaching on their old portfolio spaces when they are here.

After show. After the art show ended we all sorta were sitting around, chilling. Haha. Ginger reminded Jerry that he had never formally proposed to me. He did and I accepted his offer to become his 7th wife. Haha. I'll use the three-times re-used paper bouquet of flowers. Awesome.

So yeah. That was my ""big, extreme, long-ish"" day also known as Thursday May 6. Which was also my best friend's birthday and I felt super bad for not being able to go over to her house :( Well here's a belated Happy Birthday Debbi!

Woo. Im too tired to write about today. So I've summarize very briefly. I went to school. Sat around doing nothing. Got told dozens of times how wonderful my sister's artwork is. Rearranged the art room. Went shopping. Came home. Went driving in the ghetto at 9:30 at night. Chatted on AIM. Updated my livejournal.

So there you go."

"event","Well Mondays suck. I went to school and it was like I was walking under water. I was vaguely awoken by MR screaming about Adam not being in class, but then settled back into a fog until lunch.

Somewhere in this haze I heard that NHS members were supposed to be present at the freshmen orientation thinger tonight. Gah. 

Dude it was like not even six months ago (it seems) that I was going to that thing as a freshmen. I feel old.

Anyhoo, the day dragged on. I actually have no memory of Social Studies other than Annemarie handing Tracy a picture of an angry and/or laughing Hindu person that was on page 11A of the newspaper. I think.

Everyone is freaking out in Art Portfolio class. I mean like there was yelling and swearing and throwing of small items. Didn't bother me, I was like super mellow with my block print and little-carving-thingers.

Oh yes me and Jerry agreed that since we had no idea what we were talking about for our little art demonstrations at the art show, we would make up a long, intelligent sounding ramble for an explanation of our techniques. Example: ""You see, when you're dealing with a complex piece like this [point to wood block] you need to be sure to use only the 5 millimeter crevice-enhancement tools. [point to carving thingers] Be sure to make only horizontal alignment strokes and if you feel you need more texture, try angling the tip parallel to the wood base.""

That's my plan.

I forgot freshmen are so gullible. The NHS people were supposed to gather groups of the kids and take them on a tour. The only questions I heard were ""How big are the lockers?"" ""How many dances are there?"" and ""Is there really a freshmen kill day?""
Yeesh.

Wow. Its 10:00 and I havent started my homework. Hmm I think I need to start getting more than 4 hours of sleep a night. :-D"

So by dinner I am so tired. I made enough garlic bread for all of the 60 people though and felt pretty happy that no one complained. Some people evn came back for seconds! Score!

After dinner stuff just suddenly started hitting me. I have no idea why but one minute I was laughing about something and the next me and Debbi were sitting up on the boat house, talking about all that has happened and almost crying. This year has been really hard and I can't believe that I'm leaving next year. Wow.

Anyway, I felt better after going and chilling in the lodge for a while. Then there was camp singing time and I decided to go and join in, just because I hadn't done this in almost a year. Hahaha It was great. I ended up running around giving high fives and back scratches to all these people I barely knew. Good times.

After dinner there was more food to be served to the hungry masses. We busted out the ice cream and all the goods and THE GOOD SODA! Man, you have to taste this soda. If you have never been to NGYC and tasted the soda (this soda is bottled by an old-fashioned soda company in the little town of Shawano, Wisconsin) you have not lived.

So after I get everyone their ice cream, I join Becky, Brian, Danny and Ryan at a table. We're just chatting and playing speed and all. Becky suggests we play poker. And then Ryan suggests strip poker. Hahaha. So we start off. In the first half an hour, Ryan loses everything but his shirt, shorts and a belt clip. Brian folds most of his hands and me and Becky have only lost shoes and jewelry. And Danny, who is like this major punk-ish person, has a gazillion bracelets (that he insists on removing one at a time) and belts and layers of clothing. So me and Becky gang up and play our cards. After a high straight, three of a kind and a royal flush, we finally get him down to a shirt and pants. Then they chicken out and decide to go down to the bonfire.

We all wander down there are stand around. Me and David started talking about bonfires. I dont know what it is about bonfires, they look all pretty and warm from a distance, but up close they are too hot and smoky and ashy and they suck. So we sorta abandoned the fire and wandered around back to the lodge.

So that was basicly was my weekend. I woke up Sunday and did not want to go home. I took lots of pictures and so I should have a posting soon.

So yeah."

So yeah. Saturday was not fun waking up to. I was so cold and stiff and sleeeepy. But I dragged myself out of bed and made it down to the kitchen by 7:00. And I made (well okay actually just opened the cans of) peaches and pears! Yay! I served bacon and I was an awesome cook. It was pretty extreme man. :-D

Oh wow get this. After breakfast Abby and Jessica wandered into the dining hall (still in their pajamas and with bed head hair - but no one cares its camp) and started doing dishes. I asked them where they were staying because I hadnt seen them. They said they got in late and went straight to bed - but they couldnt sleep because when they went into the lodge they heard some people whispering, didnt know who it was and got freaked out. HAHA We had both been in the same building, totally  freaked out by each other and oblivious to the actual situation. Funny. Yeah.

After breakfast me and Debbi cleaned up and wandered around. I was so hyper after 2 hours of sleep I couldnt believe it. Hahaha.

At this point all the people have been divided into 5 groups - they were planning some sort of skit. When me and Debbi went back into the lodge a few guys had converted the hallway outside my room into a changing room for their skit costumes. I don't know how this works out that they wanted to kick us out of our own cabin - After a moment of confusion we kicked them out pretty quick and told them to go change their pants somewhere other than right outside my bedroom.

I ended up going canoing with Debbi and this little junior high girl. She kept giggling insanely and almost tipping the boat. Then one of the adult-type-people yelled at us to get on our stupid life jackets. We just held up our life jackets and waved and rowed out to the middle of the lake. We ended up just floating around out there, watching this other guy David hit golf balls across the water. Fun.

Yeah so around lunch I suddenly got really sleepy and so felt really sick. I think it was because I forgot to bring my many medications with me and my blood levels just got all crazy. But me, in my confused and crabby state, after someone asked me for the millionth time what was wrong, I just scream very loudly ""I feel HORRIBLE! Its my blood and its so messed up!"" It must of sounded like something else was going on with me because the guy who was standing by the counter just looked at me and split. HAHAHA.

Well anyway I felt better after lunch. And by the way May 1 is National Cheese and Beans Day. I celebrated this patriotic holiday and spread the word on bean awareness. It was awesome. Don't ask - just eat some beans!

Okay this post is also going a bit longer than I like. So I guess I'm starting a trilogy or something."

"event","Wow. This weekend was fun... but so different from what I expected. I mean, I love going up north and all and chilling with my buddies, but lately its just not the same.

For one, all my close friends that I've known for the last four years have all graduated and moved on. They're all at college and to busy to come to any of the retreats. Now its all these younger kids and I feel so old. Ack.


Let's see. I get there at like four o'clock. Noooo one around. So I claimed an empty cabin and unpacked my stuff... then I realized that I have no stuff because I FORGOT my stupid suitcase ON MY BED! Ahhhh! I was soooo mad. But then after freaking out and all, my dad just told me he'd take me to Walmart and get me a toothbrush and some clothes. Whatever, it works for me.

(coincidentally, this was the same Walmart that me and Ashley were standing outside of last summer when this oooold guy came up and decided to tell us his life story)

So yeah. I get back and put all my stuff in my cabin, which me and Debbi were sharing with Becky, Rachel, Britney and Jenny. We just sit around our cabin talking for like the whole evening. About 11:30 as all of us are pretty much asleep, the Minnesota busload of people arrived.

Yeah.

After we realized that every bed is filled and there are still people coming in and lots of them are talking and there probably wont be quiet until about 2 o'clock or so, me and Debbi grab out stuff and decide to wander outside and look for somewhere else to sleep.

There are no other cabins available, so we head on up to the lodge (which hasn't been used in months and is dusty and icky and luckily unlocked!) We found two old beds and just crawled into out sleeping bags and tried to sleep.

Man it was cold - like 40 degrees cold - and it sucked. Around 3:30 we freaked out because we heard someone walk into the lodge and we heard footsteps. I finally got to sleep but unfortunately woke up at 5:00. Sucks.

Okay this post is way too long and I hate long posts and yeah. So I will continue this in another post."

Okay let's take a look. Yes I am making lists again and I don't care. It's therapeutic. I think.

1) 4/29: Going Up North this Weekend! Wooo! *Must pack* Ack!
2) 5/6: Go Art-crazy and produce enough art for art show. *Draws like mad* And I have to have this block print done *Carves like mad* And I must have my portfolio presentation ready *Prepares like mad*
2) 5/6: AP English Exam (Huge-big-deal thingy-costs $82 to take and yeah)
3) 5/6: Must get up at like 4:30 to be at school by 6:30 for NHS thingy. Yes and this is also the same day I take my AP English exam and present work at the art show. Oh yes.
4) 5/7: Must have complete 8-page newspaper layout DONE by this time.
5) 5/8: Buy present for best friend's b-day!
6) 5/13: AP Art History exam. Enough said.
7) 5/15: Must have 2 job application in by this date.
8) 5/19: Must have ALL volunteer hours in by this time for NHS... have to complete 2 more hours. ACK.
9) 6/5: Have to finish NHS Newsletter.
10) 6/9: Final Exams.

So yeah. In between these times I am just freaking out, studying for about 3 or 4 hours a day, doing art for 2 hours and volunteering for about 1 hour a day. Oh yes I am doing great.

Thanks and this has been a wonderful stress-fest.

"event","Okay today was very quiet and calm. Weird. After a long crazy week and an even crazier Friday and Saturday, the quietness of a Sunday always hits you so unexpectedly.

Well we (we as in the family and I) were invited to this family's house.. which in all the six or seven years we have known them, has never happened. They are nice, they have like a gazillion kids (okay its just six but still) and a huuuuge old rambling farm house in the middle of their 124 acre property. Wow.

So I just sort of sat in the living room and the kids all sorta gathered around me like I was an alien or something. After a while they dragged out an oak chest filled with old clothes and shoes and etc, and started playing. It was actually funny seeing them do that. Weird to think, ten years ago that was me.

Well after a while things got crazy. The little girls chased their five-year-old brother around and put a dress on him, and then he refused to take it off! HAHA I was dying it was hilarious. Then the kid got mad and started calling us the worst things he could think of: ""You Hewetics!!"" (He meant heretics, and he had no clue what it meant-I think he got the word from his dad!) Then the dad saw him in a dress and got reaaallly mad. Woops.

So yeah. That was basicly my afternoon. During the car ride I got in trouble *again* for opening my big mouth and saying something or other that supposedly offended one of my family members. Yeesh. My family is a hyper-sensitive, analytical, defensive bunch. And yes I just way-over analyzed that statement. Oh well.

Sorry for the disconjoined (is that a word??), long, frizzy (yes I said frizzy) post. Its just been one of those days. So yeah."

Yeah, if you read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cadaveroussoul"" target=""newwindow"">Scott's blog</a> or <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/jamn8877"" target=""newwindow"">Debbi's blog</a>, all they say is.. ""oh, I dont want to go to prom, its dumb, blah blah blah.. but if they would ask me, I would go in an instant."" And guess what happened Friday? Of course, just like I predicted, He asked her! LOL

I think its hilarious. Im happy for Debbi, since I have lost any interest in going to my prom, I can at least have all the fun of helping someone pick out a prom dress and etc etc. LOL

So yeah. We went to the mall today, braving the public transportation system (aka da BUS) I had the Bus Stop song going through my head the whole time. Especially when we joined a group of girls in running across Burleigh and Mayfair Road, trying to catch the bus. Good times.

We went to Marshall Fields and Boston Store and etc. While I was waiting for Debbi to try on like 20 dresses, I tried on a fluffy blue one. It was HUGE and POOFY like nothing..I mean woa. I couldnt even fit through the dressing room door The skirt was so huge.. it was hilarious.

We got some food and then wandered around in Sam Goody. They didnt have a single CD I wanted. (Psst if you're looking for good music or just want to be my eternal friend buy one of the following: POD, BarlowGirl, Kutless, Relient K or Toby Mac)

After surviving the public trans. system once more to get home, I'm now sitting at my desk, avoiding the inevitable. Art History *shudder*

Well I guess I better get back to my homework. After all, my school's prom may be tonight but I have a hot date with Picasso. 

Oh yes, that was an awesome groaner joke if I ever heard one.

"event","Well its friday and Im bored as ever. This week was mostly just a blurry series of non-interesting events.

Monday I was so tired in the morning. During spring break I would get up at 8:30 or so every morning, so my body went on strike when I tried to wake up at 5:15. Ack. By Tuesday my sleep schedule was so warped that I was ready to cry when I woke up at that ungodly hour.

Wednesday was NHS and I realized that I need 2 more volunteer hours by May 15. I went to go sign up for something. And everything has been taken. Wonderful. Now I have to either beg someone to give me some hours or I have to endure volunteering in the library for another 2 hours. Ack.

Weird thing happened Wednesday night. I was joking around talking about Mrs. W and er stupid-ness (for further info and a loooong rant on this lady, go to my other blog http://bitsandpieces-ofme.blogspot.com) ANYhoo, I was talking to my dad in the kitchen, just casually talking about how annoying this lady is, and suddenly I start bawling. Seriously. I havent cried in months, not since November, and now this. I just went to my room and sobbed and realized how much this woman is stressing me out and completely making my life horrible. She is manipulative and cruel and I can't take it.

Well on the brighter side, I have become an art machine. Haha. I am very practical and like to plan out every piece of artwork that I do. But with 2 weeks left until the art show I figured that I had better get moving. So now I'm churning out this very spur-of-the-moment, expressionistic looking things. And its not just me either. Aleley is going all ""Monet"" on us, and I'm feeling like I've gone from Baroque to Impressionistic all in a short time. (Sorry I'll stop. Too much AP Art History cramming. Ack)

Back to the future... [Insert corny music here] Ahem. Im bored. Its Friday. Give me a call puh-leeeaase!

Well okay. After years of being a little middle school website designer freak with no one wanting a site designed by me, I get hit with two commissions. I don't even really do webpages anymore. What's going on?

I don't feel like doing them, because one page is for a ex-hippie folk band and the other is for a traveling concession stand company. But they are my dad's friends, and he already promised them I'de do it. So yeah.

On to a relevant topic.

None really, except that I am sick of school as stated before. I have a ton of stuff coming up.. some good and some not. Eight more weeks... *shakes head sadly*

Okay here it is: (My little calender haha)
April 30-May 2: Spring Retreat. Up north, and I get to see my ""camp"" friends. Sweet
May 6: Have to be at school at 6:30AM. Have AP English Exam. Have Art Show. Ack.
May 8: Debbi's Party!
May 10: NHS Induction. 7 PM I mean who really cares?
May 12: AP Art History. Ack again.
May 13: Jalepeno Loco. Yay-ness.
May 28: Jenny's Party!
June 3: Senior Sleepover(?) From what I've heard they finally moved it.

"event","School is back. Ack. Its just like everything is grey and muted at school. Its so dragging. School is ack.

Its not like I have bad school experiences or anything. I have a handful of good friends and I get along with everyone. (cough cough almost everyone) And people think I'm shy because I'm so quiet at school.

I am quiet because I'm BORED!!!

That's why people who see me out of school are surprised at my hyper-ness and weirdness.

On to another topic: I just realized I have several groups of friends... very different groups who pretty much know nothing of each other.

1) My school friends: I see them pretty much only during the day and I've known most of them forever.

2) My Racine (etc) friends: Anna, Jenny, KT, Josh, Hughes, etc. [ Hey you guys you rock!! ]

3) My camp friends: Wow we're all really close and keep in touch by e-mail. We only get to hang out like once every 3 months though.

4) My Etc Friends: Yeah, I don't really have a tidy little name for this group. Its just people who I hang out with. Debbi, etc. You guys know who you are!

Sorry for the rambles. This post is getting too unorganized so I shall start another one. Toodles."

"event","I've been thinking. I am becoming obsessive over this whole thing if you haven't noticed. I need to just be myself and chill. I need to get back to school stuff and etc etc etc. I guess.

Well the good thing is that all this week I have not been stressed out or anything. I totally neglected my Art History studying and I don't care. Its my last Spring Break as a kid and I'm going to live it up.

Carpe Diem.

And I did.

This whole week was like a little slice of summer, like the way it used to be. It was sizzly and endless and great. I am so not ready to go back to school.

Well now I'm just chilling with Debbi, waiting to see if her boyfriend is coming to her house or not. I am bored and sad that this week is ending.

"event","Yeah well spring break has been crazy. I love it and am so confused at the same time. And now I'm just more confused...

*Thinks back..* Okay Spring Break flashback time:

Friday: Woke up early, went running, hung out with Debbi. We went to a Good Friday service which was cool, I've never done that before.

Saturday: I was helping out at a snack stand with Debbi selling chocolate. I met her boyfriend, and he's cool. We all hung out during the afternoon, then me and Debbi had fun running around Papa John's (literally-around and around the building.. don't ask)

Sunday: Easter and it was cold! I spent all afternoon family style- lots of baking and board games. It seemed sorta annoying for a while, but then I started thinking about that this will be the last family holiday thing before college. Weird.

Monday: I went to Cave of the Mounds. Wooooo! It was dark and sorta smelly and chilly. I liked it. Haven't been there in a while and all. I survived the trip in a compact car filled with five people with minimal damage :)

*Back to the future...*

Tuesday: ?? I have like no memory of Tuesday at all actually.. Weird

Wednesday: Sat around, chatted, did nothing. Around 4:30 pm I was ready for a lazy evening of movies and such... then Debbi calls. Approximate conversation:

*I come in from from the other room after taking a shower...*
Debbi: *types on computer* ""Hey, Scott is online""
Celessa: ""Say hi from me.""
Debbi: *pauses slightly* ""What would you say if Scott were to come up north here...say to my house?""
Celessa: *gives her a look* ""Well... what would I do then? I don't want to be a third wheel""
Debbi: ""What if Scott brought a friend?""

Etc etc etc. Next thing I know we're waiting for them at Debbi's house. They call my cell three times on the way because they got lost. HAHAHA. They thought 73rd was a thru street and spent an hour and 40 minutes taking a 40-mile long tour of Milwaukee. :) Suburban people... lol

We ended up going bowling. Fun, but when I'm nervous I act like a stupid, loud, annoying dork. Hahaha. Actually not funny. Ack.

Anyways, we all got back to Debbi's house about 10:30 ish. We all sat around in the living room watching the scary looking guinea pig stare at Ryan :)

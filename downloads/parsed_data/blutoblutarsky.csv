"event","I GOT MY LICENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i also got the MONO.
after 17 and a half painful years i am officially a licensed driver of the state of new jersey, but my doctor wont let me leave the house at all for the next 2 weeks. the examiner dude was really scary. he didnt say a word other than parallel park, k turn, back up, and take this to the dmv. but he was kool cz before i even moved the car he checked me off on everything. so i was passing no matter wut.
now for the bad shit. i have been on my death bed for the past 3 weeks. first i had the flu. then i had some weird shit that they couldnt figure out wut it was, and since they coudlnt figure it out they sent me to school. now i got the MONO. that has me out of commision for AT LEAST 2 weeks. the doctor got back the results of the bloodwork to say exactly how sick i am, and they were literally off the charts. she said that on a scale of 1-10 it was an 11. and now im not allowed to even leave my room for a week. let alone go anywhere else. if it wasnt for midterms last week i would be out of school for a month straight. god damn exams. 
the worst part about this is i cant have my motherfucking white castle. i have been craving those fucking things for over 2 months, and i cant go get them. even if i could i would embaress myself cz my appetite is GONE. i cant even eat HALF of what i usually eat. i guess when it rains it pours."

"event","ok, football has officially started, which means 4 months of me running nd dying. but the best part is I GOT LAID OFF WORK! my boss couldnt comprehend that i couldnt work on fridays cause of games, so he told me to come back and see him after football's over (which i probably wont do, but oh well). i have to make the bigest decision of my life... i need to choose between buying a car, or buying a guitar. i really really really really fuckin want the guitar, but my mom told me that i have to buy this car cause she wont let me get anything else. thats teh only thing that sucks about getting laid off for 4 months, but oh well. ill prolly get the guitar, nd not get the car. but honestly, i coudlnt give 2 shits."

"event","ok, its been a while since ive updated this sucker, so lemme recap everything ive done. my boss gave me permission to order people to do shit at work, and so far ive made 2 ppl quit in a week. im very proud of that. one of the guys from work told me im an alcoholic and i have a problem, so i respond with ""i like to drink, whats the problem?"" 4th of July was fun. my cousin's uncle was giving me this mixture of tequila grand manrier(spelling?) triple sec and margarita mix. yummy. 
i hate my mom. she ""supports me for whatever i want to do,"" unless it involves money or music. she would rather have me spend my money on a new comp even tho we have 2 brand-fuckin-new ones, than buy a new guitar. so as usual, i call my dad and he tells me to tell her to shove the computer up her ass, and he'll take me for my guitar the next time he has off. not only does he take me, he saves me $300+. he is AWESOME. im glad that hes the only one besides my aunt nancy that supports anything i want to do, no matter what."

"event","ok, this is my first post. and im only doing this because i have NOTHING better to do. its 12:34 am tuesday morning, and im sitting in my room with my guitar pressed firmly against my balls, playing random musical notes nd whatchamacallits. doofy just came in my room nd said something, but since i hate listening to his girly voice i told him to ""leave, i dont like you."" today at work  my boss told me that im not aloud to have a day off, so in protest, i burned all of the pizzas until he told me he was going to start charging me for them. so naturally i had to start actually ""watching the oven,"" as my boss calls it. he calls me a teenage werewolf because i refuse to shave and cut my hair. today his wife said that im just as annoying as him and we could be father and son. i work like a fucking mexican. 55 hours in 5 days. thats illegal. ok, now i have nothing else to say at this particular moment in time. its 12:48 in the am nd im still bored as hell. so ill prolly be back soon to ramble on about more random crap"

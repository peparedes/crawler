"event","I had been thinking about posting this when I got home last night, and it was still at it's freshest in my mind, however after getting home there was a gathering of sorts occuring, consisting of myself, my fiance, Fated, to whom many many thanks are due for all the wonderful pics that I should have my paws on soon, and a couple of other people we haven't seen in a while. Much mead was drunk, and it was discovered that Pop-in kebabs have indeed grown. :S they were long enough already!
So i decided to wait for this morning to do so....


In a nutshell, it went rather well!
After a little trepidation on my part due to some communication issues back down the line, we arrived, with set up and first impressions of the venue, I have to say were more impressive than i thought. I'd been told horror stories about the previous incarnations of the place (when it was the 80's bar), so when it looked a little more like the inside of Brannigans, there was a definate plus in the tick box. Staff on hand were polite, friendly and helpful. Many props go out to the guy on sound, he knows his way around a sound desk, which is more than some prestigious venues can claim....
We set up fairly quickly, had a bit of a soundcheck and settled down.
The night there being a new venture there isn't as much interest as i think there will be in the future, but we dragged a little posse along, and there were people coming in at the sound of playing.
The guys at West Street Live really seem to want this to work,and are willing to put the effort in to do so.
A quick change to how we were going to play later, and we took to the stage for the first set.
Song order as follows:


1. Will I?
2. Departure
3. Perfect Rain


Because only Ed and I could make the gig, Jack (http://www.myspace.com/strangetrain) being down in his hometown for a long since prearranged gig, we went for the more acoustic set up. Those who remember 'infinitum' will know what I mean there. Those who don't - lead bass anyone? ;) Spent a fair chunk of the last week rearranging songs to fit it.
Despite my initial worries about it sounding slightly sparse (having been used to going with 5 instruments and 3 part vox harmonies previously) i'm told it sounded good at the rehearsals, so that was all good.
Balance was great soundwise, and whilst there were a couple of little fluffs which can be attributed entirely to nerves, we kept on going, and hopefully not too many people noticed!


We then had a break, and the other act of the night, Mr Steve Gascoigne (http://www.myspace.com/stevegascoigne) took to the stage.
We had no idea at all as to what would be going on, having only been given the name, but i for one was very pleasantly surprised. Blues and rock with a litttle bit of roots, and a smidgen of country. Even a little reggae was thrown around the sets. Lyrical craftsmanship was spot on, and the amazingly well controlled sound from the desk meant i could actually hear the words, which I'm very glad about, as words describe emotion and emotion makes the song.


After his initial set there was a bit more of a break and then we returned for the second time.
Songs this time round were:

1. Midnight Blue
2. Inspired
3. Show me Heaven (Maria McKee cover)

Midnight blue ((C) David Coverdale) is a favourite of ours, and we've adopted it as our own, play it as our own and enjoy it.
Inspired was funked up a little... its the only way I can really describe it!
It relies a fair bit on  keys for a lot of the sustained sounds, and not having keys avaliable we needed to work around that. I think it worked rather well, and I liked the arrangement which is something! Being my own harshest critic thats a good thing. Jack wrote the original tune and lyrics, but donated it my way for rearrangement and other stuff. There is his version kicking about somewhere... hehe, but there is now another, which is definately ok.
We did have a version of Exposed ready to unleash upon the world, but we decided against it. It would have been a little out of place I feel. More in place with stuff from TDB... so we finished with 'Show me Heaven'.
The simple guitar line gives space and allowance for muchas bassage, and acts as the stalwart constant for vox and bass to weave and intertwine with one another. I also happen to be able to sing it, and remember all of the words!


So all in all, i think, and hope at any rate, a good night was had by all!
If i get any reviews back to me from people then I'll post them up.
(There are pics on the way which i will post up too)

All that remains is to say a great big thank you to Ed, for playing and putting up with me for all these years so far, to Steve Gascoigne for obliging me in conversation in the break, and a wonderful set, and the guys at West Street Live for having us. (Looking forwards to August already :))

If you came to see us then thanks very much for coming and helping to make the night what it was. If you didn't then.... make sure you come next time.
Help to keep live music alive!

"event","was supposed to be heading to a friends house to cut their hair this evening... unfortunately having had no sleep whatsoever since 7.50am saturday this may not be the best plan.
Have just called said person, to apologise and rearrange. It will now take place on monday so not too bad, but i hate having to cancel things.... 
in this case its the best bet though. 
I don't want to do a botch job or cause an accident, and my friend understands. so i dont feel as guilty as i normally would... 

wolf this afternoon and then bed for me i think.... 

although one random outcome of the insomnia was i applied for two jobs online.... 
either of which would be nice.... so we'll see i guess."

"event","now have a working detailed plan and the dissertation handbook, although the online assessment handbook is not online... :S that could make the formatting of the final thing interesting... but i know ive got at least three copies of lying around and can get alison to email me one if i really cant get one... 
haver to have the main body handed in in rough draft, so thats all good.
Diana has priomised to look at mine first, so will still have stuff to do, but again, less pressure on me.
just need to get hold of a rabbi preferably, or a online jewish community/etc who may be able to answer me some questions about more modern burial traditions and what they date back to (ie the why).
if all goes well i should hit 12,000 easily. means some intense work this evening and tomorrow day (band prac tomorrow evening) saturday sunday and monday, but not as bad as it could be :) gonna spend today doing biblical research i think, mainly delving about in the penteteuch, which is where most of my stuff will come from...(as well as NT and burial of Jesus, whch was jewish in nature (Jesus was jewish remember) and thats stuff for the appendix :)which should come out at 3-4000 words, specially if i have to converse with people and stuff.. 
also found out that my presentation only has to be 10 minutes long and then 5 minutes to take questions. mint. i can do that. just have to hope that i find stuff in the middle now. can find early stuff and modern day should be a problem, but theres abotu 1500 years that might have changed.... if i cant, it would be interesting to compare x-ian and jewish burial but slightly on too much of a tangent... perhaps should i ever go for a masters... it might be interesting... but ANYWAY. yey for online concordances is all i can say.


on the housing front, the references should all be back by monday fingers crossed, and all should be good.
so possibly moving at the weekend (next weekend) woot! :)


passport office are bugging me too... :S i need to go to te police station. report my passport lost. Might just ring them and let them know im moving in the next fortnight, cause if it turns up i can just send it them. Its not in   stuff at me mums... and im going to andy's to check those boxes again in a bit, and its not here... 
but yeah... its going ok.

on a break now. expect many more posts like this until monday 4pm."

"event","waiting for bird from northern counties to ring back. 
can't go out until she does.
I have work i can be getting on with so its not *too* bad.... prolly gonna go for a late night thing today though... 

<lj-cut text=""dont read if not interested in the medical escapades or if squeamish"">
had two bleeds in the last two days. one whilst out yesterday and another this morning. a third means a trip to the walk in clinic. This mornings wasnt as bad as the one yesterday (bout 1/2 pint of blood down the pan so to speak then) but still kinda gushing. just have to wait till the next time.... and then it becomes something which may be of interest to the medical profession. </lj-cut>


oh the joys... anyhow, yes, the dissertation. its no longer the intensely DRY BONED (hehehe punning!) site reports of doom.... 
its now an exploration into how isrealite/jewish burial traditions have changed and WHY. Lots of meat hopefully to chew, and a few people may be able to throw a few bones my way.
am up to about 2000 words so far, which isnt too bad. and have a fairly detailed plan going on which is good. Just need to make up my word limit and then stick it into formatting, and then go waste lots of money printing out a complete rough draft. then i have to work out how it needs to be bound and try find somewhere cheap to do it. 

May also have to pay out a large amount of library fines next week, as not moving before then means i haven't found said books.... ah well... ill pay it and then sell the books on. one is mega rare anyhow so should be able to get 60 quid on amazon should anyone buy it. although ive never sold anything on amazon before so we'll see... heh. could sell it back to the library... that would be cool. meh whatever. tis what me student loan is for... 

wedding plans are kinda stalled again. 2nd ceremony venue issues. hopefully resolved fairly soon... 
do however need to book the date and the family only reception venue. cause that way can confirm things for people requiring flights. also need to ensure that people who have said provisionally that they would do stuff (photos etc) are still okay to do it.

not quite so stressed about this as i could be. maybe cause ive got more pressing things right now, but next week will prolly see the civilceremony and reception booking etc... meaing from next week i try to go jogging... woot.... (its cheaper than swimming if a little less effective.)"

"event","not quite.... whilst i havent been doing work.... there is a reason for it (except for thursday when i really *was* just procrastinating but with good logic behind it)... So Thursday, i check the uni library website to see when it shuts on the friday... they had changed it from last time to say that it would not be shut all day.... bummer. So my plan of working in the library doing prelim research on thursday and friday morning were screwed, and a 4 day gap would mean i wouldnt take in the info as well as if i were to use it nearly immediately. 
So pondering what to do (as the library shut in 3.5 hours anyhow) I headed onto MSN, and a couple of people pounced me.... including Kergun... 
After a little chat, we decided to head out walking. Something ive not done in  a while, but was very welcome.
We got a number 29 after missing the train and headed out to Penistone. 
We walked in a random direction, ie to where we could see country and we ended up on the transpennine trail, which was kinda cool.... we didnt stick entirely to the trail, but we followed it, and walked until the sun set, coming to stop at a bridge. Had rations and then watched the sunset, took photos etc, and went to investigate the bus stop should we wish to carry on from where we left off another time. Turns out we were on manchester road *grin*
we then headed back in the dusk --> dark, moon risen by the time we were halfway back, and then found we'd missed the bus by 5 minutes, and the train by about 300m ;) but the train was due sooner than the next bus, so we went to the station, which is really pretty... but it was too dark to take pictures... all in all, despite my desicion to get back into it lightly, we'd done about 12k (yey for accurate pedometers) in the few hours we were out there... and boy did we feel better for it.... 
there's just something about being outdoors doing that kind of thing that is both exhilarating and healing... i know it may sound cornyor crass, but its true... it always did have that effect on me, and im guessing it probably always will.

Friday... 
Because the library wasnt open as it was previously, i met my sister in the morning, and we hobbled round town... understandably, i was fairly stiff... and not half as bad as i thought... but still a little stiff... 
anyhow, that was cool, and it went fairly well, bought a couple of DVD's in the HMV sale, and a Bathos from Lush cause last time i was in there, i bought me mam one, and then forgot id wanted one too!
After lunch, in weatherspoons I headed up to <lj user=""ghostreign"">s for a jam with him and <lj user=""autopaginator""> as chris was up from southampton for a few days...  twas an ok meeting of minds, after which Ed and I went to the pub... south seas in crookes... *has photos to send to Ed*

Went pack to parents for the night as sister and i were due to do hair stuff on saturday. 

Yesterday was ok.... not really much more to say... i got some stuff done work wise and took photos off things, as well as fixing me dads pc so fairly productive day. and i now have odd hair... dont know if i like it or not yet.

there are a couple of things im frustrated with right now, and im going to wit and see how they pan out.. there are a couple of things im having second thoughts about... and they are all oddly interconnected in random ways... 
prolly best not to say anything about any of them right now... i needto gather them, and waiting till after my dissertation is done is probably the best time to actually think over them.. by then im hoping that one of the things should be sorted out... but i guess we'll see... 


was gonna post some pictures on here from the las few days... maybe ill do it later...i managed to deflate between the beginning and the end of this post... odd... possibly not"

"event","and so the posts go on.
Not having any comments for a week now is rather odd... it must be confessed.... almost like ive disapeared into a haze of obscurity, which is possibly not too far from the truth... :)

today i *will* start my dissertation. I've got a book to read so first things first... that one, which apparently will give me links to other books in the library, so it would be a good start... and best thing is i dont have to leave the house yet...

i get the feeling the topic may change into something a little more accessible...which means i need to get hold of a few people....which could prove interesting however ive got a few tricks up my sleeve for that... 

was browsing the IKEA website yesterday in anticipation of actually having somewhere to live in thenear future with any luck... the good news is (seeing as we now have a sofa thanks to <lj user=""motherkat"">s keen eye and freecycle) that the money ben owes me (weird thing to do with ISA's) *should* be more than sufficient to get the required furniture. Carpets will be another question... but it might already be carpeted etc... and i won't know till i get there so im not getting too stressed about that. I don't want to get my hopes up cause it might still fall through, but i can't help but make the occasional plan.
there are a couple of odd things ive always wanted to have in my house when i finally got one... so im going to see if i can incorporate them.... twill be interesting, and i don't know if it will be possible yet, and i know i cant have one of the things i wanted until i own a house, so i can get extensive reweiring done without needing stupid certification and pay enormous prices...


yes im procrastinating... i know.... and i don't care... 
to REALLY procrastinate.... im going to have a bit of fun pricing up stuff... 

but thats because i need to get it done...  :)

dont really have anything to say about me right now... im still alive... still kicking... still going... etc etc. look like another phase shift is occuring but thats ok....some people will be lost, maybe others found... and if not....well thats ok too."

"event","so today, i got up, had a shower and stuff, and got ready to go out to the hospital. figured that 1 hour 15 would be plenty of time to do a 40 min journey... cue the 75 taking 55 mins to get into town, and then 10 minutes in town waiting for a bus... at which point i ended up on a 201.
Made it with 2 mins to spare, met ed, and after getting confused over which door i needed to go into, got to ENT.
As it happened they were running 20 minutes late, so it wasnt the hugest problem.... fairly quick... apparently there is no big explody thing in my brain.... and thus this means that they are at a loss to explain the hearing problems, and the sight problems, so their solution? Monitoring.
Woot..... 
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad i don't have a brain tumour... but im a little gutted that there is no clue, and essentially they've given up.
i could sit and rant and rant about all sorts of medical stuff, but in the end it won't make any difference. all in all... i just have to wait.

so yeah, today after the appointment, and coffee with <lj user=""ghostreign""> who kindly accompanied me to the appointment, we met up with <lj user=""autopaginator""> who is back for the easter hols, much missed and was really good to see... 

we did lunch, ranted about various musical things, reminisced about past projects etc, and worked out that we've finally worked out what we needed to work out four years ago in terms of music stuff.... 
hopefully we will be able to persue that someday.
In the meantime, we're going to tinkle and widdle on and hopefully come together soon.... 


so yeah... just need to get the dissertation done... a few things im mulling over at the moment... probably see fruition after a couple of weeks... may well not post about it, as it would be locked and the only people of whom it would be of interest too would be unable to access it..."

"event","so yesterday was the genetics clinic visis... 

Despite me not being overall happy about having to attend the place, i do like going. They treat me like a human being for one, and have yet to try and withold anythign from me,
basically when i got there we had a general chat, and then she said that basically they wanted to touch base with me, and let me know the develooments that have happened since i was last there, and she had wanted to look at my notes in full rather than just the updates she'd been sent but had been unable to procure them before meeting me.
Basically there is a bit more known about the types of polyps ive been developing, and they are not as benign as previously thought, but its not the biggest deal in the world - just confirming that it will be a life long issue.
Secondly there were two things she needed to ask me about, first being if i would be interested in contributing to a genetic study thats happening... i have no problem with this.... if they can work out what causes this, then they might be able to fix it for other people.
Secondly they wanted permission to have a removal sent to them next time there is one, so that they can study the genetic material in there for clues. again no problem.
I then mentioned the other stuff, and finally there may be some communication between everyone. She is going to request ALL of my notes from everyone,have a GOOD read through, and write to me with her thoughts, and possibly the other doctors too.... the down side of that means that results of the mri dependant opens up the possibility of neurofibromatosis which would be bad... but im not stressing..."

subject to references, its ours...

i just dont want to get up hope and have it rejected, not now.... 
and hopefully people will be prompt with the references and we'll be in there before the end of the month... which is when we have to move out of Kit and Daves.

so keep everything crossed"

then out for a couple of hours in the evening... 
tomorrow will be slaving myself up in the library researching for the dissertation, and then tuesday will be slaving over it at home whilst prepping for wednesday after calling up to my parents to collect the stuff... wednesdays out of the window but thursday and friday in the library except for when on my genetics appointment. Weekend hopefully more of the same... then all the week after will be in the library... 
i think the week after easter sunday it switches to 24hour opening...  so getting it done is plausable at the very least i hope.... 
then two weeks to concentrate on the presentation and a week on the essay, which is probably going to be on worship in the corinthian church.... but ill see... and then hand it all in, get the two days of presentations done, and then sorted full stop!"

it was worth it. 

today i booked tickets for  my  dad and i to go see whitesnake in june, and when i get paid, ill be booking for ben my dad and i to go see iron maiden and trivium in december... yey for having an aging rocker dad.

feeling a little more chilled out today than i have in a while which i guess can only be a good thing... not caring much about work stuff is probably helping.... that and my immediate team are being taken out to lunch by stavros... mwahahah.... we get to go sample takapuna's food menu, so not going to complain at that.... also my flexitime all adds up so i wont be working too late the next couple of days.... not that i can on friday due to band practice... but hey....
just hope i can get straight into the dissertation stuff now that im almost done.... :S"

"event","well, today is friday, 
I get to go be tested.... 

bought myself a pair of chav joggers at lunchtime.... they're metal free and will be good for slouching around in afterwards so not the worst investment in the world.... 

today i am the only one on our team in the office, so ive been kept fairly busy, which is a good thing methinks... went out at lunchtime for coffee with ed.... gave him some money towards the practice later seeing as myke will not be attending either... 

student loan appeared in the bank today... slightly unexpectedly... it wont be there for long however..going to pay off overdraft on the natwest account.. which means i need to go pay it in... also need to put more in the ISA and stuff, but it means i will hvae a little left over which will give me a little to play with... i want to try and halve the natwest overdraft ideally by december, but that is going to depend on several factors... which will leave me way ahead of the planned payoff times, but thats fine :) if we get a house in the next couple of weeks though it will mean a couple of things that will be needed can be bought.... 

wedding wise, plans may be changing... there is a new possibility for a venue....  am seriously tempted to take it up as it sounds groovy and will mean it can be sorted soon. will definately go have a look around there anyhow.

im aware that im rambling on a little.... ive come to a natural break in proceedings and in ranting on here i don't have to think about later.... needless to say im not looking forwards to it.... 
im terrified that they will find nothing.... 
when i mentioned to my lecturer yesterday that this was the case she couldnt get her head around the fact that i can be so pragmatic about it.... but i am... if they find something, fine, it means i can get on with things, and know what im up against, but if not, its more not knowing.... and im terrifed that they will accuse me of making it all up... which is a highly unlikely possibility, but one which goes around my head.... tis a karma related thing... i have bitched about someone in the past who makes out their illness is entirely debilitating, when it isnt.... and it may well come back to me over the next couple of weeks.... whichis guess is my own fault... 

as ive been writing this, the arts tower is slowly being blotted out by the fog...the top is dissapeared into the fog now, it could go up indefinately for all you can see... 

this weekend sees me being very busy.... i have CD's and cases to buy, an album cover to design, and then get the first batch printed out (as many as we can get done... so probably around 35) and packaged ready to go.... 

im a little discouraged as nobody has looked at the page in a few days now, or listened to any of the sample songs, so it looks like the advertising may have been an absolute failure.... 

its interesting to see how many people who were so eager when this was first announced have suddenly gone very quiet... im not bitter, or mad... just interested to note this. people change and grow away... thats fair enough. I can guarentee selling enough to cover the costs of the first batch of CD's and cases so it wont be a complete failure... and if the worst comes to the worst, ill have a LOAD of birthday presents for the next few years ;)

i go through phases, at least twice a day of being entirely unsurprised that nobody has shown interest... but thats because i frequently swing between opinions of the music.... ultimately, i can't be the judge of it... i know that, which is why i have kept going with it... and will continue to do so.

i have yet to spam CE about it, and will probably do that over the weekend, which will be interesting... 

im also undecided as to whether to make the demos' shorter than the EP or not... ill need some proof that i can do this stuff when i try to get the gigs organised (either directly or indirectly) and i think less may be more in this case.... im pretty decided on the 4 song option as to what will go on there.... and im getting there with the EP... ideally i had another song i wanted to get recorded for it, but it didnt happen, but its one for the album.... i just need to get back into writing them again... which will be the interesting thing... i write sporadically and differently to anyone ive met... 
i also need to get leaving [town] out of ogg vorbis format and into MP3, which i can do at the parentals as soon as i get audacity downloaded as it does a pretty good job of converting things... its the one im least happy with... there wasnt a lot i could do with the mix in the end, its cleaned up pretty well though, and has a really rough edge to it, which is actually quite appropriate for the song... 
Jack and I seem to collabarate well... i think collabarating may be the way to go for the next set of songs...as i can't rely on flashes of inspiration on a regular basis, and bouncing ideas around with someone seems to work fairly well... i think that comes out of me knowing what im trying to get across but being unable to play the instruments in the way required.... fortunately, ed and Jack are both great at being able to do that for me... and be able to reproduce for me what i hear going on in my head... so i just need to get on with that 

i am entirely aware of th amount of waffling that i am doing but... if you're still reading woot... and if you're understanding it even better!

im having an insecure day i think.... talking about later, fears that the music thing will flop entirely and the one thing i thought i was *some* good at will be proven wrong... 

the arts tower is entirely obscured from view by the fog now... its quite odd... almost as if someone clicked their fingers and made it disappear... 

i should probably shut up and do some work now... i may post more... 
i may not... i dont really knwo - suddenly i dont feel quite so talkative..."

i couldnt decide what i wanted.
so i decided a jacket potato would work.... and instead ended up with pie and peas... and i minted them. minted peas are one of those things you forget about until you have them and wonder how you can forget they are so good.

after last nights....episode... im a little more together today...
dont really have much choice, but im managing.

only one person at work knows about any of this, and thats only because htey kinda noticed every wednesday for the last four or five weeks ive come back from my lunch with at least one letter from a hospital which has meant that ive had to ring for an appointment etc
and then last week (when he found out) when i rang my mum to give her the time of the mri (as she'd asked)got slightly. Queue jaw dropping and me explaining very briefly that theyre testing me for something.

so two more weeks of being happy smiley until i finish, and then jump straight into teh dissertation. hopefully get it nailed and then some serious time off is in order for me i think... of course i ave to make it that far first.

still not entirely sure about much right now....
probably wont post much for a while incase people get annoyed tat i seem to 'moan' all the time..."

"event","not having such a good day today.... 

entirely indecisive and little things not happening are making it hard to get to the end of the day...
time has slowed... 
the hours left here seem impossible to complete.


i thought i was off to a great start this morning, when i woke up, it was light and i was awake - and then i looked at my phone to see what the time was. 05.37... 
went back to sleep for a snooze. up 15 minutes before alarm due to go off at 7.40 out of house for 8.20.
walked to the bottom of the hill near the corner shop for the bus as it left the stop before i got there... intercepted it with 3 minutes to go. in work and settled down for 9am. This week i had an important job. the spreadsheet which indicates the entirety of how JCP is doing ovewr the last week and predicts the current weeks performance as chris is on leave all week. I also had to take a collegue through how it is done... no major problems, until it comes to the QA.
Its passed up the chain to Stavros, the team leader... immediately feel as if ive done something terrible and screwed it up as some of the figires have changed from last week... i can't explain it when im asked, so its passed on to someone else... not a happy bunny....grrrr
... time passes, get on with a piece of work ive been forced into doing and really dont want to... turns out id done nothing wrong... the forumlae in the spreadsheet had a bug... nothing i could have done abotu it as i dont know the workings of the spreadsheet that well... phew...relieved. i didnt want to mess it up and i hadnt... yey... 
more work on stupid work plan until the other file to be distributed with report comes in at which point it all gets sent out... 
go for lunch... wander round. dont know what i want. ended up with 2 packs of corn and maize snacks (dont really like potato crisps) and some chocolate. no intention of eating it all today but it gave me a choice. drink of ribena and a coffee, with amaretto syrup instead of caramel as there was none. not really sweet enough.... never mind.
ring ben, who was on the phone so said hi to kit, and arranged that ben would ring back... he did. sounded like much fun was going at the other end of the phone. Chloe is round there. could hear lots of laughter. made me wish i was there, even though i cant help wondering if it would have happened if i was there.... 
tired. despite extra sleep. still tired. hoping coffee will help. seems like the bina will help more at the moment though. thinking about leaving work early today.. between 4 and half past. have got flexi time built up so not a problem, but i don't knwo if it will help at all...we'll see i guess...need to try to think of somethign fun to do this evening..... jusdt not sure what... damn indecisiveness"

"event","dunno if anyone will be able to answer this or not... 
but if there is more than one option for proceding with regards a hopsital case... 

i would say im talking hypothetically, but im not so... 
meh... 

okay, i have the appointment for an MRI scan next week, if it comes back that i do have tumours on my brain (cause lets not beat about the bush - if its the polyps, they are tumours/lesions/polyps - all synonomous, and if its an acoustic neuroma, which is the other thing being bandied around its the same thing - talking benign anyhow)

I know from having looked it up what the options are.

Option 1 is surgery - the most popular choice - it should remove all the growth, but sacrificing ALL hearing in one ear (unless growths are present in both... ) as they have to sever the auditory nerve to successfully remove the anomoulous tissue as well as 2 weeks in intensive care and a lot of potential for complications.

Option 2 is radiosurgery. - used on smaller to meduim growths.
can cause shrinkage of the tumour. Most likely it will not disappear entirely, but will probably stop it growing anymore.
its non invasive and  generally better... 

if the option is there can i demand i want the second option first?
ie, obviously, if its not a plausable situation, i wouldnt demand it... 
but my docotrs try this all the time...they just assume that i dont know the options... 
yeah im probably stressing about this a little too much but ill probably forget if i dont say it now... 
im forgetting a lot more things than i used to..."

ive had nothing to do today at work... i even wrote 1.5% of my dissertation... not a lot, only 150 words, but it means ive started. I have a plan to continue it. thats something.
i brought a book with me as well, jsut like i said i would yesterday... and havent touched it.
a book on planning weddings. hardly seems appropriate now...on the plus side it has some ideas for alternative things... and before you panic, the wedding is still on..... as far as im aware, but then  the amount of things that have been cancelled today and i havent been told about until afterwards i wouldnt be surprised if thats included too.

i also chased up the address to send the form off to northern counties, so will be finishing that this evening - been promised a good ref. so thats at least something... just have to hope that it goes through okay and that they agree with us with regards to the circumstances.

im just sat whiling away the time till i can leave now today... im meeting a friend of mine for beverages in a while... hopefulyl ill feel a little better for that, and then head back, get that form done, and get it to the post box and then have a bath and head straight to bed i think.... i need to be in early tomorrow and will be out late... <i>note to <lj user=""motherkat""> - I won't require tea tonight, so feel free to just make enough for four.... still feeling off anyhow so will grab some milk on my way home for me to sup and hopefully fix tummy</i> 

Tomorrow i have a meeting with uni... to discuss the money i supposedly owe them... and to try and get special permission to register.if they dont give it me then im quitting. no second leave of absence.
i dont care if it screws things up for me in life.... ill be able to get *some* kind of work... and the extra grand a year can be kept as far as im concerned... 

ill shut up before causing WW3... no doubt you want to bitch...

I hadn't expected to write anything about what's been happening.

Iris . . . I haven't spoken with her in ages, although I have been assured by a few mutual friends that she's doing fine.  Wish that I knew for certain, because she's sold the mansion that Psych Mosquito willed to her, or changed the locks on me.

Keeping the store afloat in winter is a hectic thing . . . and costly.  I've been either there, or tending to the biosphere for the past several weeks . . no, I don't really know for how long.  On top of that, Da's forgetting to eat again, so I've been making up meals, storing them in the freezer, and then having to check on him regularly to make sure he's even eating them.  Just last night, he admitted to not having eaten in the past twelve hours, possibly more, when I went in to ask.  While making him a batch of spaghetti, mild, I finally had a chance to tell him about Tengu.

Something's drastically wrong in Tengu's head, he's paranoid, nervous, tends towards hysteria, <i>and</i> is acting brashly.  I'm worried, because it's something non-physical, something in his programming that's wrong. I'm sure of it.

Gave Da the contents of the data dump I did on his self-diagnostics program.  Got everything since he was transferred into his new body . . . I think he's [***********DELETEDCONTENT***********], of all things.

And yet I can't tell anybody.  So I put it up here, where it's not likely any of my siblings will see . . . risky, because they may find this journal, but I . . ."

In making sure that a shipment of bananas made it out safely from one of the primary docks along the Ivory Coast (no, I'm not saying which one), I found someone had hidden in one of the crates.

And 'ook'ed at me when I asked them to climb out.  The voice was rather familiar, so I'm guessing it was either Jazz from the Maverick Hunters, or perhaps the less-than-stable rampant flirt from the Mavericks, Mirror Pegasus.

More likely to be Jazz than Mirror, thankfully.

Either way, whoever-it-was teleported out of the crate to places unknown.  Afterwards, the oldest of robot science, Protoman appeared.  And said nothing, although he was carrying a towel, before he teleported out.  Rather peculiar."

"event","Not much has happened since almost all of my repairs were finished, but there <i>was</i> something that happened yesterday that was quite amusing.

Although Snake really needs to get over that bad habit of his of baiting our siblings, it actually worked out in a way that was pretty funny, now that I think back on it.   I walked in on the second half of it, but apparently Snake had been baiting Tengu over the radio while in the biosphere.  Snake had hidden himself on one of the upper branches of my house-tree, Shadow was just listening to the biosphere nearby.  Tengu just stalked off in search of Snake a little bit after I stepped in.

Admittably, I wasn't in all that good of a mood to begin with, so simply headed inside to get back to baking cookies for Da.  Didn't pay any attention to the radio, not really, so Snake diving in the kitchen window and plastering me to the floor accidentally was a big surprise.

In the scramble that happened next, Snake hid in my closet downstairs.  I let him squirm in there after Tengu and Shadow walked off.  Petty, I know, but I was annoyed.  Calmed down by the time I had the cookies in the oven, so I went downstairs to tell him they'd gone.  Must've beenr eally paniced, because he hid in that Rio dress of mine, and that's a complicated bit of work to get out of.  Dashed out past me when I opened the door, tripped, and knocked himself out falling into the stairs.

Wish I'd had a camera, the sights of him in the dress, unconscious, was priceless.

He was still panicing when he woke up, and it took a little to calm him down enough to get the remains of my dress off of him.  He did say thank you before leaving, which is a <i>rare</i> treat.  No regrets on how things turned out, although I will miss that dress.  I don't have a whole lot of reds that look good with my eyes without turning me into a christmas ornament."

"event","Ugh . . . the past week has been a bit of a blurr.  And all because of that raid on the United Nations.

Da decided that make a hit on the UN building would make for a good strike back against the Maverick Hunters.  As with anything that involves a lot of my siblings, it was utter chaos.  Destruction everywhere.  I found out later that one of my siblings managed to infiltrate and plant a bomb in a subsidary of Light Labs nearby.

The carnage level was very, very low.  I'm rather happy to say that the UN is well-defended, Repliforce <i>and</i> the Maverick Hunters responded quite promptly.  

Da's mecha was trashed in his fight against Rock, but he won.  Smacked Rock a hard one over the head with his cane to end the fight. Watching vids of that later was very, very satisfying.  I like the blue boy, I can admire him, but there's just  . . <i>something</i> about a good fight ending well like that.

I just wish DeVry hadn't arrived as well.

DeVry . . what sort of sick genius implants his own brain into a cyborg body in order to live forever?  And furthermore, keeps creating animal-based bioroids despite their instability, over and over and over again?  He brought one of those to the battle. Huge, hideous beast, vaguely humanoid . . . I don't know what it was originally.  I couldn't tell, it was rotting and dying even as we fought.

It used the most bizzarre set of weapons . . . acidic vomit, huge, swollen, bioroid-maggots that sought me out.  Metal tentacles that were razor-sharp. A gatling gun that sprang from the back of its throat. In it's chest, for no reason I could tell, was a monkey bioroid that screamed one word over and over and over again until I killed it.

I killed it.  I killed the monkey, I killed the maggots, I killed the beast.  And looking back, I can't regret that, even though it might have wanted to go on living.  Such pain, life twisted and warped into something so . . unholy.

Even now, I can't . . I can't find the emotions I felt then.  Those memories are under some sort of clear shield in my mind.  I can see what happened, but I can't <i>feel</i> it anymore.  And looking back, I'm glad of it.

It exploded when it died, and I was right in the middle of that. I've spent much of the time since the fight recovering, and Da repaired almost all of the damage right off.  But the new coolant pump keeps throwing me off . . it's a bit over-pressurized, and my head keeps swimming. It feels so weird . . 

Last night, I ran into Miss Tron, and she and Da repaired what was left.  I just need my hair re-rooted now, and with the normal tubing length back, the head-swimming, shaking, and dizzy spells from the new pump have died down to almost nothing.  Still adjusting, but the effects are fading.  Which is a good thing, this pump is also smaller, and has a filtering system in it. <i>Veeerryy</i> nice.

Spent a large chunk of the morning cooking up stews and one-dish meals to freeze and store in Da's lab freezer. He hasn't been good on eating of late, and I'm going to put a nice big sign on the wall over it that points down and says <big>'Food Here'</big>.  Maybe that'll remind him to eat every now and then.  Also been baking to fill up the cookie jars . . I've set up three in the barracks, one in the mess hall, two in the biosphere, and I've got a big football-shaped metal one I'm going to put in Da's lab."

"event","I miss Matilda.  Yeah, she was a plant, but she was unusually intelligent for one . . worked as my lab assistant for over a year.  I watched her develop from a small sproutling I had gene-tweaked, trying to get a better variation on the guard-traps I have all over the place, into a very large, intelligent being with her own personality.

And now she's gone, has been for a while . . . 

Marcus . . Marcus is cute.  But he's no Matilda, despite being a 96% copy of her.  Mentally, he's leagues behind her, sort of like a perpetual child.  And because of that, it's a good thing that his growth was retarded as well.

Thinking it over, I could hate Bass for what he did . . . but what's the point?  She's dead because of what he did, but there were also so many kids that had to be evacuated first.  And that's not a death I would wish on anyone.

I already hate Bass for a lot of things . . . I shouldn't let this be another weight to that hate.  The emotion hurts enough as it is."

"event","<i> There was a time
Not too long ago
When heros wore shining armor
And knew just where to go
When evil was the monsters
Drifting in the cold and snow
When monsters were monster
And not angels from below

The old ones have the choice
To change, or to die
So much knowledge lost
Grandchildren, left to cry
Saying their wings are clipped
They have them, but refuse to fly</i>

 . . and that's what's been haunting my mind, the past few days.  Living at the mansions been nice, if uneventful . . between work, spending time in the garden, studying, I haven't had much time for just thinking.  The few times I've had the time, well, I thought on that poem up there.

So much to do, so little time."

"event","Da was in a really good mood yesterday . . . gave <i>everybody</I> the day off and we all went to Wilyworld! (Gravity's project to get more money coming in, and it's working, too!)  Shadow, Da, Ring, Pharaoh, and I decided to duke it out on that Robot Masters Fighters game Magnet helped Grav develop for the park.  It's actually really fun!  It's set up for eight players all at once, so we were able to have a nice free-for-all . . kinda surprised I won, though.  Even beat Da!  And I was playing as Quint, no less . . . guess it just proves you shouldn't use cheat codes, and being completely random in what you're doing helps.

Next was the rollercoasters, and that was fun.  Although, I'm starting to wonder just when I picked up the 'wagnerian opera instead of screaming' habit.   The rest of the night sort of doesn't make sense . . . I do remember eating quite a lot of ice cream, cotton candy, and funnel cakes, so I'm guessing I was on a sugar buzz until quite late.  I wonder what I did."

"event","Ahh . . sorry for the bit of silence, but I've been busy for the last few days.  Between studying, maintaining my experiments, <i>and</i> moving many of my posessions into Iris's new place . . . I'm bushed.

Pun not intended, and will be shot on sight.

All joking aside, its been rather stressfull.  Not only was it my possessions being moved, but many of my milder experiments.  At least the ferns get plenty of pigeons to eat now.

Marcus seems to have made a good impression on Iris, and she doesn't appear to mind that he needs to snack on raw meat every four hours.  I had to replace the tank treads on his pot, however, after the set I had originally installed proved to not be orange-juice proof.  There's a bit of a story behind that, but I'd rather forget it at this point.

Oh yes . . I was introduced to a new level of stress just the other day.  A dear, <i>young</i> human friend of mine says she wishes to marry this '<b>fine</b>' man she's met a few times.  Apparently, fifteen was her magick year for discovering boys.  Needless to say, he's much, much older than she is from what she's said.  Introduced the concepts of personal romantic taste, personality compatabilty, and the possiblity of her tastes changing, although I'm not sure how well they'll stick.  I hope they do, she's far too good (and intelligent) a girl.

Ah me, gone and gotten myself depressed again.  I'd better go check on the gardens and the shop again."

"event","Complete, and utter boredom for most of the day yesterday.

Human physiology is fascinating, I'll say that . . . but most of the videos on their digestive systems are <b>boring</b>.  I really shouldn't have rented so many from the library at once.

So far, today's been boring too . . . First I get ordered to check on the algae farms, then I get sent off scurrying after information . . 

Sometimes, work is work, and sometimes, work is boring.  Ah well, Pharaoh's yelling about something concerning those priest-robes he had me make, I'd better go check on 'em."

One should not ignore the crazy lady who's got a turkey baster pointed at your ear. No telling <i>what</i> she might do with it.

Um, not quite sure what to do with this . . . might as well tell you how yesterday went.  After visiting <lj user=silentsteel> at her work (and ending up making sure she'd taken her meds), I ended up working in lab A-2, one of my three commercial products lab.  Only to be contacted out of the blue by Miss Iris, who wanted to talk.  Despite having run into her on Eurasia earlier in the week, I didn't have the foggiest notion what she wanted.

At her new home, she laid down what she wanted to do, and was hoping I'd be able to help with: continuing the work towards ending the war she'd started with Psych Mosquito.  I will not tell you what was said upon that, it's private.  But in the end results, Marcus and I will be moving in with her!  The house is far too big for one person.

She seemed rather relieved I was moving in . . . her boyfriend doesn't get to come over as often as she'd like, and it sounds like the house spooks her a bit.  I will be spending most of today moving the ah, 'less accepted' at the Fortress half of my wardrobe to the house today, along with my milder experiments and little Marcus."

"event","What a set of days it's been . . . might as well start with today, and go backwards with a litle bit of what I wrote in my journal.  Not sure why I'm putting it up online, but, eh, there's a first time for everything.

<lj-cut text=""Today"">
<b>Today</b>
Woke up to find I'd fallen asleep in Lab C-3 in the Biosphere again . . . had a crick in my neck because of it.  But at least the mind-numbing details of documenting mold species in the Biosphere got me asleep after being up over half the night with insomnia.  I swear, he's going to drive me into an early grave, worrying about him . . . Da stopped in soon after I woke up, and asked about the books he'd sent. Told him I'd been reading them, and trying to research further, which is true.  More or less.

Decided to visit Steel-chan at work after that, found her <i>not</i> taking her pain medication, and scolded her while finding it for her.  It was a fun fight, actually.  She's got a bizzarre sense of humour when she's in pain.  Was only able to find some generic painkillers, but apparently they worked, as she wasn't snarling when she left to do her rounds.

I've been browsing the web while waiting for her to return, and I found a surprising amount of m'sibs have journals. O_o  Kinda makes me want to strangle them all, but that wouldn't do anything.  Gonna add them to her friends list if she'll let me.  Been thinking about getting myself one of these . . but don't have the blunt to get a paid account. Irritating.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Yesterday"">
<b>Yesterday</b>
Overheard a conversation while waiting for the elevator. Sounded like Stone and Ice, but I could be wrong . . . so many siblings, and not enough vox-box to make us all sound completely different.  Either that, or Da's a bit cheap.  Anyways, here's how it went:

Stone: Freakish.

Ice: C'mon, leave her alone.

Stone: It's <i>sick</i>, dressin' up like a girl.  And don' tell me it's not.

Ice: . . . 

Spent the rest of the day in a bit of a blue funk, even if it did attract more than a few cuties.  Kinda hurts, but Ice did try at first . . gratitude probably only goes so far.  Those cuties were girls as well as guys, which surprises me, now that I think about it.  But I think I'll start changing at the store rather than at the Fortress.  It'll save me having Forte use me for target practice on sight.  Been feelin' the 'Hentacle Freak' of late . . . which is more and more weird, considering I don't really have any gender.  So what if I like to flirt?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Day Before Yesterday"">
<b>Day Before Yesterday</b>
Sucked. Bigtime. Spent all of the day in the repair bay putting Knight back together after he pissed off Punk.  Found myself humming some of that german techno Steel-chan listens to during the middle of the repairs.  Pissed me off, for some reason.

Evening went a bit better, went over to Steel-Chan's place in California (nice, cool weather).  Odd thing was, she was having a major craving for chocolate.  That's only the what, sixth time in all the years I've known her?  Got me a choco-taco at the grocery store, as well as some V8.  Drank five cans one right after another right in front of her, just to watch her shudder.  She snitched the sixth.  Spent several hours talking about human physiology, what it actually <i>feels</i> like, stuff like that. Talked about Cuties too, but capping the night with Excel Saga was probably a bad move. Had really weird dreams.  Something about the 'greater spirit of the macroverse' wanted to lay eggs in the  middle of my biosphere, and I was fending her/it off with a flyswatter. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Three Days Ago"">
<b>Three Days Ago</b>
Spent a very large chunk of that day and the next just researching.  Both for my projects, and in that honkin' huge pile of books Da bought me. I don't think he trusts hospitals anymore, and I can't blame him.  The last one had cops on him the instant he stepped out the door.  Ballade's been good at making him continue taking his blood pressure pills, though.  Speaking of pills, I've been keeping a closer eye on what Da's been eating, and it's a sobering mess.  So I made up a few teas for him to help cover some of the deficiencies.  Had to spike 'em with brandy to get him to drink any. *sigh*  Ballade's been reading some of the books, but he promptly shoved the higher-level ones into my lap. I don't think he wants to be responsible should there be a need for surgery or something. It's been nice, though, just having something to talk over with him . . I don't get to speak with someone who's on the same mental level and not utterly freaked out by me very often.</lj-cut>"

"event","A Message from Jon Weisberg 
Below is a message from Jon Weisberg (former bassist of From First to Last):

Hi, I am Jon Weisberg, the bassist of From First To Last. Last month I was forced out of the band because I was told I was not ""passionate"" or ""committed"" enough to the band. That is completely untrue. I was more than 110% dedicated to the band and equally as excited about writing and recording the second album and that's why I was so hurt and upset when this happened. I tried to talk to the band and set up a meeting so we could at least resolve this and work towards making the best album that could be, but the band refused to talk to me. After being a member since June of 2003, I received only a phone call from their manager telling me I was no longer wanted in the band. I tried and tried to get any one of the band members to talk to me to discuss what they did. Finally one of them agreed he would call me. After a whole day of waiting for that promised phone call, he called roughly 12 hours late and spent the next 15 minutes telling me all the things he said I did wrong, trying to make it so he didn't feel guilty about what they had done. Of course all of the things they said were minor and were things others in the band also have done. In other words, they were things that are just part of life on the road. I could not believe how little they cared. I have worked so hard to see that this band succeeds over the past 2 and a half years. I have been on the best and worst tours with this band and just as almost everyone else, I have lived out of a crappy apartment in Gainesville, Florida, with not even a mattress in the room to sleep on, only a carpeted floor. I was there for the awful tours like one where one of the members broke both of his arms and we were left to continue on because we needed money so badly that we did not have enough to leave tour to go home because we would not have been able to afford enough gas. The tour where the van broke down in the middle of nowhere in an awful thunderstorm with punctured tires and a broken window. This is just part of paying my dues to help get the band in the position it is now in. I have been through it all, in the best and the worst, and now I am being left with nothing. After thinking about this for many weeks now and after careful consideration, I have decided I have to file a lawsuit against the band in order to recover all that I have earned. I tried getting around it in every way possible. I tried to negotiate a way for me, if not be in the band, then to at least take part in the writing and recording of this record which I had already started working on. I was willing to put this whole situation behind me to write the best record we could. I wanted us to leave as friends and have no hard feelings after this. When I thought we were making progress, they sent me a written agreement saying they wanted me to be on the record, and I spent 8 hours a day for several weeks working on writing bass lines for all of the songs. What I got was the cold shoulder and, after a written agreement for me to be on the record, a broken promise. A little over a week ago now, I finally had a meeting with the band. It went pretty well except for the fact that they still were leaving me with nothing and they wanted me to be ok with that. Even after they told me to write bass lines for the songs and after I put in hard work to make them great, they decided right before rehearsal was supposed to start that I could no longer be on the record. I truly wish that this did not happen. I want to apologize to the fans for this whole situation having to come to this. I tried every way to avoid having to do this. I still want to be with you and make music for you which is why I am starting a new band currently named ""The TRAGIC."" We have an e-mail address(thetragicmusic@gmail.com) and feel free to e-mail me at this address to let me know what you think or if you have any questions about this situation. There is also a band myspace account that does not have much information on it yet, but the account is there (www.myspace.com/thetragicmusic). I have worked extremely hard for the past 2 and a half years and I have sacrificed a lot, including dropping out of college, to help get the band to the level where it is now. I hope you can understand why I have to do this."

"event","Hello Hello.

So this weekend was fun.
More of Saturday being the funnest.
I got up REALLY early.
Hannah came & picked me up at 10:30 & her Gramma took us to Mayfair Mall.
It seemed like FOREVER cause her Gramma decided NOT to take the Freeway.
Jordan called Hannah & they were on the phone untill we got to the mall.
Got to the mall & Hannah ran up to Jordan & he gave her a huge hug. Awwww.
Walked around & went in some stores.
I got a sweater at Delias.:)
Then we went to the movies & saw The Fog.
It was the gayest movie EVER.
Then we went to Claires & I bought some little kid's pearl necklaces.
Then we went to Sam Goody & I FOUND MY FROM FIRST TO LAST CD!!
I FINALLY FOUND IT.
Then we went to the food court & all of a sudden, my cell rings & it's a number I don't know.
It's Porter & he's like "" Hey. I can see you.""
I turn around & there's him & Michelle Lopez by Cinnabun.
I go up & talk to him for a bit & then go & buy some TACO BELL & me & Hannah & Jordan ate.
Then we walked up to Sam Goody where Porter was & I talked to him some more.
Then we walked around again & went in Hot Topic.
Saw David Farias & talked to him for a bit.
Then talked to Porter some more. 
Then we got bored and we went in this store with these really big bean bags.
Sat down & almost fell asleep.
Then we went in Starbucks & I got this really nasty "" cappacino"". 
Then we decided to walk to Peir One & we were in there for about 5 minutes & got bored.
So then we went to Best Buy.
Started walking around & Saw David, Porter, & these weird girls.
Talked to Porter some more & got annoyed by the two girls.
Sat in one of the isles & danced to the radio.:)
Then we waited outside for my dad to come pick me & Hannah up.
Waited a hour in a half outside before my dad came to get us.
He was all bitchy.
So then he took Hannah home & I decided to go & stay the night with him at that hotel.
Got ready & then we went.
I stayed up untill 2 watching Roseanne, The Fresh Prince Of Bellair, & Cartoon Network.
In the morning I woke up early & got breakfast with my dad.
Then we walked around the mall a bit & went home.

So that was my weekend.
Fun."

"event","<center>So I'm in my Word & Powerpoint class.
It seems that's like the only time I get to update this thing.
& or my Greatest Journal, which I refuse to use now.

So Porter tried dying his hair with <b> CLOROX BLEACH </b> last night.
Niceee. Well the next time I see him he's probably going to have a 
big bald spot. HAHA. I told Brianne today & then she ran & told Sigrid.
Ehh. I guess we're cool again. Idk. :-/ I'm kinda regretting that I ever
snapped on her. Well, I snapped on Crystal ABOUT her. But still..

So it took my teacher like half the damn period to figure out what the hell
was wrong with my computer because it wouldn't turn on.
He walked away when I said I needed help & the second time I confronted him
about it, he's like "" WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO!"".
Um.. yeah. Old people don't need to be teaching.

Well last Saturday & Sunday was pretty eventfull.

Saturday was very lovely. I got to hang out with my fabulous <b> Hannah</b>.
I walked halfway to her house, while being on my cell with her, & eating a big peice of Chicken Tender. I'm so hard core like that yo. So then we called Porter & told him to come pick us up. We went to Berchild's & it was pretty boring there. Except I drew a penis and a smiley face on Bruce's shoulder while he was sleeping & he thought Porter did it lmfao. He kept creeping me & Hannah out cause he would like stare at us. EWWW. CREEPY. EWW. I wanted to like crawl underneath the couch & die. So then me & Berch & Porter & Hannah decided to go to Target but Berch had to stop off at Bruce's house for something. So when we got to Bruce's house, we wanted Josh to like key his car. He wouldn't do it. & then... the worst happen. <b> BRUCE CAME OUT IN HIS BOXERS.</b> That's one guy I would NEVER WANT TO SEE IN JUST HIS BOXERS. Me & Porter & Hannah about died laughing. So then we went to Target. Hannah & Berch kept getting annoyed by Porter so they tried ditching him. I wasn't bothered at the time by him so I sticked with him. Then Porter decided to steal a earing from Target for his lip peircing. So then he walked out of Target & I had to go & find Hannah & Berch. Got in Porter's car & sat there for what seemed forever while he attempted to put a EARING in his lip. It didn't work. ( DUHH.) So then we went to the movies. Porter was getting pissed at the fact that Hannah was ignoring him. Stood outside & tried to decide what we wanted to see. Me & Hannah wanted to see <b> Corpes Bride</b> So that's the movie we saw. I thought Hannah had money to see it, but she didnt so I gave her the ticked that I thought I was paying for Porter with. Porter just walked in & sat down & was being all pissy. Then in between the movie, Berch started being gay & wanted to leave. I felt bad because Hannah was trying to enjoy the movie & so was I.Although, I've seen the movie before. After the movie, we ditched Berch & then drove to my house to find money for the Haunted House. Got money from my mom & then went to Hannah's. Hannah got 15 bucks out of her grandma & Lorin said she would pay for Porter. Got to the Haunted House & stood outside for like a half a hour. Got inside & then Kaitlyn called Hannah. Me & Hannah stood outside & waited for Kaitlyn & her sister Carey to get here. Then we waited inside & Me, Hannah, Kaitlyn, & Carey got put into a group with 4 of these preppy girls. Everyone else was in a group together. So here I am, freaking out and like grabbing onto Hannah. Basically raping her. & we go into this like tube thing and there is literally a bunch of 8 year olds who start to scream at us. Me & Kaitlyn screamed back lmao. So then we were waiting outside of the haunted house & everyone was messing with Kaitlyn's amasing hair. <3 So then we finally get inside the haunted house and this guy started talkign to us about what happens if we break one of the rules inside of the haunted house. He had me & Kaitlyn step forward & when I looked inside this like jail cell thing. This like guy popped out of it. Me & Kaitlyn started laughing & then we had to all crawl underneath this stupid door. We go into this like pitch black hallway. I'm freaking scared as hell of the dark so immediantly I grab onto Hannah lmao. Hannah is holding Kaitlyn's hand and Kaitlyn is left to lead the way. With then that time, the 4 preppy girls were all freaking out. Carey kept grabbing the back of my hoodie & it was kinda pissing me off. It was basically a waist of money. 9 bucks down the drain. Stupid assholes popping out "" attempting"" to "" scare you"" when really you just stand there and go "" Uh, hi?"". We were all crammed into this one elevator thing and this girl in our group started freaking out. Me & Kaitlyn & Hannah started humping each other. It was great. <3 So then we FINALLY get out & we run & tell the others how retarded it was. Porter started to ditch us for his other friends so me & Hannah just walked around with Kaitlyn untill she had to go. Then we found Robby & hung out with him for a little bit. Finally, Porter came up to us & then we took Lorin, her boyfriend, & Stephanie to Lorin's house. & they all were in the back seat with me. So then Porter dropped off Hannah & then he took me home. Yayyyyyy.

Sunday I went to BFG'S with Brianne & Berch to watch Thode paint ball. Then we went to Berchild's. Got kicked out of Berchild's & then Brianne dropped me off at Mcdonalds cause that's when me & Porter got in that fight. Made up & then we walked to Hannah's. Hung out there for a bit & then I walked to Brianne's. Got lost & had Dan come to pick me up lmfao.<3 Ate pizza & then Brianne's mommy made us HOMEADE COOKIES!<3333 Then Brianne took me home.

Tonight I'm probably going to the football game with Hannah & Kaitlyn. 
Two amasing girls that I love. <333 
I'm gonna run. Byyyyyeeeeee.</center>"

"event","So I'm going to make this a VERY straight forward entry. 
I'm going to referr this with who I am talking about.
Because I'm not a fucking pussy like that and say "" Omggg I hate them booothhhhh.""

So everyone wants to really seriously know WHY I'm not talking to Sigrid.
WHY me & Brianne that is aren't talking to Sigrid OR Crystal.
But more Sigrid.

It's one thing to cover a friend and be there for a friend when he/she needs it.
It's another to lie to another's face and make that one friend look like the bad guy.

Sigrid knows she lied.
And yet, she can't admitt her mistakes.

When Brianne confronted her, asking her if Crystal was saying anything about her in Parenting on Monday, 
Sigrid responded with "" Omgshhh. No.  Crystal would never do that. It's all in Megan's head. Megan's the one lying."" SO IF I WERE TO LIE TO BRIANNE, THEN HOW COME I CAME RUNNING UP TO HER AFTER PARENTING TO TELL HER THAT CRYSTAL CAN'T FUCKING DROP THIS AND WAS TALKING SHIT ABOUT HER!!?? 

I don't see WHY Sigrid continues to try to be in this when it has nothing to do with her.
Brittany Kolarik either. 
And yet they sit there and act like they had something to do with this whole ordeal when really they need to shut there mouths and stop sticking there heads where it doesn't belong. 
Sigrid and Brittany also needs to stop with there little bitchy attitudes in parenting.
And for once grow up and act there ages when we are all in the same group for Parenting.
We all need to act like civilized human fucking beings and work on our Day Care planning.
This is so fucking ridiculous.

I bitched at Crystal. Yes I did.
And now Sigrid and Crystal are bringing more people than was to begin with into this.

The feeling is mutual Sigrid.
Me and Brianne both hate what you and Crystal did. 

If you still would like to be friends with us, 
try saying you're sorry first instead of blamming shit on me and Brianne.
Also, don't ever threaten me again.
Stop acting like a immature bitch.

You need to stop being such a hypocrite.
You need to stop lying to people or so "" your good friends"".
You need to stop being attached to just one friend and then ignoring your other friends.
You also need to treat people with respect even if you hate that person.
If you want people to respect you then you have to fucking grow up and stop acting like a little kid.
You're 16, not 4. FUCKING ACT LIKE IT.
Stop talking about me and Brianne in Parenting when I'm sitting right there listening to you.
Stop telling Brittany Kolarik shit when it's none of her fucking buissness.

So shut up for once and stop acting like you know everything that's going on like you were there the whole time or something when you weren't. I was. The end."

I'm going to be posting pictures of me when I get my hair cut.
Mhmmm.&hearts;

Well, I'm off. Boi.</center>"

"event","<center>So I'm going to try to update this more for some reason that I have the urge too.
My ears STILL ring from Andy's bass in his car.
Fucker.
My dad and me got in a fight after work while I had to drive back to the house.
It sucks.I can't say anything around my dad otherwise he snaps on me.
I have to be perfect around him.
Ugh.
I hope whoever cuts my hair next Thursday doesn't do a shitty ass job.=I
Well, I'm going to go watch some Viva La Bam.
Ta Ta.&hearts;</center>"

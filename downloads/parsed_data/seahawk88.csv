"event","This post will hopefully give you some things to look out for as the results start to pour in tomorrow evening:<br /><br /><b>House<br /><br /></b>Republicans have a 232-201 majority. <br />Democrats need to pick up 17 seats for a majority. <br />They are projected to win anywhere between 10 and 40 seats, so we'll see what happens. There are a lot of key House races in New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, as well as a few very interesting ones in Arizona and in traditionally red districts in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Idaho.<br /><br /><b>Senate</b><br /><br />Earlier in the year, taking back the Senate wasn't thought to be a realistic goal for Democrats. Because of the way things have been going, though, regaining a narrow majority is within striking distance. <br /><br />The balance of power will be determined by these Senate races:<br /><br />Virginia - Webb (D) vs. Allen (R)<br />Missouri - McCaskill (D) vs. Talent (R)<br />Montana - Tester (D) vs. Burns (R)<br />New Jersey - Menendez (D) vs. Kean (R)<br />Tennessee - Ford (D) vs. Corker (R)<br />Rhode Island - Whitehouse (D) vs. Chafee (R)<br />Connecticut - Lamont (D) vs. Lieberman (Douche) vs. Schlesinger (R)<br />Maryland - Cardin (D) vs. Steele (R)<br /><br /><b>Arizona<br /><br /></b>If you're in the 8th District, obviously Giffords is running against Graf. Giffords is probably going to win, even though I couldn't be any less impressed by what she brings to the table.<br /><br />On the other hand, sometimes a good way to gauge a race is to look and see who's supporting candidate X or Y. People who hate Mexicans love Randy Graf, so....that's just kind of the way it is, probably not just in AZ-08, but a lot of districts across the country.<br /><br />Renzi in the 1st district and Hayworth in the 5th district are also in a little bit of trouble, so instead of two Dem reps from Arizona (Grijalva and Pastor) it's possible we could end up with five, depending on how things go. Napolitano is going to win by about 7574108%, and Kyl looks like he's going to hold off Pederson in the Senate race - again, no guarantees of that though.<br /><br />There are 17 propositions on the ballot. It took me 90 minutes while I was sitting at my desk to look up each one and figure out what the hell they were talking about, so that can't bode well for the level of voter education about these things. I hate direct democracy sometimes.<br /><br />The main ones are these:<br /><br /><b>103 </b>makes English the official language in Arizona<br /><b>106 </b>saves some trees<br /><b>105</b> is a neutered version of 106 that people got on the ballot just to piss off the tree people<br /><b>107 </b>bans gay marriage, even though it's already banned<br /><b>200 </b>establishes a $1 million lottery that you enter just for voting (I actually voted for this, thinking hey, I don't pay income taxes yet, so I get a free lottery ticket, but I changed my mind about it - because I know that some rich jackass will probably end up winning. That's how it always goes. Kind of like some rich freshman girl always wins the car at the Salpointe raffle.)<br /><b>201 </b>bans smoking in all public places<br /><b>202 </b>raises the minimum wage<br /><b>206 </b>bans smoking in some places (so what if both pass? I'm confused)<br /><b>204 </b>says you're not allowed to tie your pig or cow to a tree for too long a period of time<br /><b><br /></b>That's about it.<br /><br />I don't really see this as some kind of day of national awakening. If the Democrats happen to have a big day, that doesn't make the country automatically better or worse. The party hasn't done a whole hell of a lot to instill a lot of confidence in anyone. Will they work more? Will they take less money from the wrong people? Will they grow a spine? Will they balance the budget? Will they leave or fix or change Iraq? I don't think anyone can say for sure. After watching hours and hours of debates and ads and attacks and visions for the future, I don't have a whole lot of hope. Alycia laughed at an RNC ad she saw on Sunday that talked about someone named ""Liberal Lois"" over cartoon-type music because she said it sounded like it was talking to a bunch of little kids. That pretty much sums it up. Over the last six months whenever I try to get political news on TV I'm treated like a child, and that's pretty pathetic.<br /><br />But I also disagree with people who say that voting is pointless because everyone's the same; the system is corrupt or coercive; partisan divisions on issues and discussions are meaningless. On a base level, I voted this year not particularly for Gabby Giffords or Jim Pederson or whoever, but against certain ideas whenever I could. A vote this year can be a vote against people who are involved in corruption and greed, people who preach hate, people who demonstrate ignorance and callousness on a daily basis. It can be against a legislative agenda that enables those characteristics. It can be a vote if nothing else, to curttail the recklessness of the executive.<br /><br />It's not meaningless. Not voting because you have no idea what the hell is going on is completely defensible; telling everyone that ""I'm not voting and you shouldn't either because it doesn't matter"" is not. Obviously almost no one is going to have a perfect candidate or a perfect party to vote for. That's the way it goes. People are different from each other and they are individually different from the large groups that they make. Refusing to participate in the system we have for ourselves because you think we're all screwed anyway is the easy way out, and it's the least pragmatic thing you can do at a time like this. <br /><br />Abstention on the grounds of ideological opposition. This means you're now the armchair quarterback. Not only are you not on the playing field, you're not even on the sidelines; you're not even wearing a uniform; you're not even in the booth calling the plays. You're sitting at home, cracking open a beer, telling yourself how you could easily call a better game than these idiots. It's the whole ""I'm not losing because I'm not trying"" bit.<br /><br />I, along with most people, don't vote because I love my party or I love my candidate that much. Most voters are filled with just as much doubt and uncertainty as non-voters, only they choose to take the leap of faith that their guy is going to do a better job in the government we've set up for ourselves. There is a lot of messed up shit that takes place along the way, and dod knows there is more than enough shit out there to be cynical about - the money, the blood, the oil, the voting machines, the lobbyists, the grade-school discourse. In the end, though, you're going to have 100 Senators and 435 Representatives and they're going to head up to that building next year and hopefully try to do some things, and who we elect affects what those things are and how well they're done.<br /><br />Tomorrow, we'll see if the pot gets stirred."

"event","On the local WB affiliate the Maury show is always on when i get home from class, right after Jerry Springer.

Back in the old days, I always distinguished Maury from similar shows because it seemed like they always used to send teenagers to boot camp. I don't know what exactly they did, or for how long, because all we saw was some big guy in a military uniform would yell at the kids, take them away, and then bring them back cured; whatever the case, it seems that these days they've eschewed that concept to go strictly with shows featuring paternity tests.

On today's show there was a lady who came on who admitted that she had slept with her best friend's boyfriend, and she thought that the baby might be his. So they bring the best friend out and her boyfriend, and she doesn't know what's going on until her friend tells her, and she justifably freaks out and leaves the set and goes backstage. 

The thing I enjoy the most about this is that the producers of the show have a million cameras ""backstage"" anyway, as well as a feed that lets the audience see backstage on a huge TV monitor.

It turns out that it's not the boyfriend's kid after all; he seems pretty indifferent about the situation, even about the fact that his girlfriend is breaking up with him. Even more interesting, the best friend is comforting her ""backstage"" and telling Maury in between hugs that ""We're gonna get through this,"" or ""We're gonna work on this."" 

The best friend, unconscionably, acts as if the fact that her baby isn't her best friend's boyfriend's means that all the other stuff about her moving to Whore Island didn't really happen either. Even more perplexing, the girlfriend seems to be willing to accept this.

In the next and vastly more entertaining segment, this lady is accusing a guy of being the father of her one-year-old. The guy comes out to a chorus of boos, then immediately wins the crowd over by taking out one of those little metal pointer things and pretending to educate everyone on the TV monitor why the baby doesn't look like him. This guy is either totally shameless, or he knows it's not his and that's why he can be this composed and charismatic at the same time.

Maury reads the results: it's not his. The girl runs away and cries ""backstage"" while the guy is just LOVING it. His delight reminded me of a Happy Gilmore celebration early in the movie, when he's high fiving everyone, throwing his arms up in the air, soaking it in, asking the crowd to get louder, while the totally underrated Verne Lundquist says things like ""Quite a large and econonically diverse crowd here at the MicheIob Invitational.""

Anyway, this made me wonder, what would I do if I was in that situation? I mean, this guy had to know beforehand that there was no chance he was the father - because if he actually had any doubt, there's no way he'd be running around stage like he just won a goddamn Showcase Showdown. I probably wouldn't go on the show in the first place, but if it was me I would probably stand up quietly and give a short, determined fist pump to the audience, similar to when Tiger Woods makes an 8 foot par putt in the 3rd round of the U.S. Open.

I don't know what to make of it. I think it's funny, because who are these people? At the same time, I always preferred Jenny Jones, when she had that Rude Jude guy on; this white gangster guy who looked and talked like Eminem, and they always brought him in to make fun of fat or ugly or ridiculous girls. Rude Jude always delivered.

Maybe I can bring it up in American Studies class, in between people who raise their hands to offer their own personal experiences as arguments for or against social issues.

""My boyfriend is in Iraq, and he says they never talk about the good things that happen there.""

""I have a lot of black friends, and none of them agree with affirmative action.""

""My boyfriend's mom has Parkinson's, and she is against stem cell research.""

Awesome."

"event","One of the required classes Penn State makes you take is CAS 100A - Effective Public Speaking.

The way it works in this class is that you and 29 other poor assholes have to take turns writing and delivering a series of speeches. You have to give a ""Speech of Introduction"", a ""Cultural Artifiact Presentation"", a ""Problem Speech"", a ""Policy Speech"", a ""Motivational Speech"", and a ""Commemorative Speech"".

For the problem, policy and motivational speeches, you are supposed to pick the same topic and, in three separate speeches, outline the problem, then give a solution, then tell people to do something about it. The topic has to be some kind of social issue that should be of concern to the audience, who is, like I said, the teacher and all the other poor bastards who have to listen to you.

Being the stupid fucking socialist that I am, of course I pick the minimum wage, on the grounds that it was the easiest, most straightforward thing I could think of at the time.

In hindsight, I should have picked something that went against my beliefs, like why we should all be anti-abortion or why we need tougher drug laws, or why George Bush is the right man for the job. It would have been a lot more fun, and there's not a lot of conscience involved in writing the speech when you know you'll just be standing up there for 7 minutes and lying to people left and right.

Instead I pick the minimum wage, and I did the first speech and it went okay, because it's easy to point out that hey, if you work full time and you make minimum wage, you're still going to be dirt-ass poor; and that is a decent enough slap in the face to people who think everyone is just great around here. But now I'm writing the policy section and I want to punch a wall.

I have a few decent arguments, but I don't even believe them anymore. I don't believe anything about the minimum wage. I no longer have an opinion. If I had a vote, I would probably still approve a hike in the minimum wage, but only because it really has no effect on me, since I doubt I'll be making or paying out minimum wage anytime soon.

The problem lies in the fact that I'm not an economist, nor have I taken any sort of class in economics. 

Just because you have done one or more of those things doesn't necessarily make you qualified to talk about it, of course, since you might be an idiot; but the bottom line is that most economists believe that raising the minimum wage causes higher rates of unemployment.

When people study what happens to our job opportunities when we've decided to raise the minimum wage, though, ""this theoretical prediction has, however, been hard to confirm with actual data"", as Paul Krugman writes. So although it makes sense that we would lose jobs whenever we raised it, for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to happen.

Still, though, I've read enough free-market, libertarian bullshit in the last three days that I'm now uncomfortable with taking a stand either way. I don't feel comfortable arguing for something that in theory hurts the people that it's supposed to benefit. I don't want poor people to lose their shitty jobs just so other poor people can be a little less poor - I mean, who would? It would kind of defeat the purpose of the whole idea.

I'm not going to go more into it because it's not worth it; like I said, I don't know what I'm talking about. The bottom line is that it depends on who you believe. There are politicians and economists and think tanks on each side of the argument who will look you straight in the eye and convincing you that they're right and everyone else is a retard.

This is an increasing trend, and a very depressing one, in my opinion. Now that we have the internet, it's easy (if you're not a hardheaded ideological piece of shit) to go from being committed to a certain cause to a person without any conviction in anything. Very few people actually do that, obviously, but it's certainly possible: if you were trying to educate yourself about an issue, and you didn't carry any ideological biases going into it, I really think that you could study for six months and not come out of it any more sure of yourself than you did when you first started.

This is what happens in a world that gets grayer and grayer by the day. When I was a senior in high school, I wrote a bunch of articles in my school newspaper for a ""left v. right"" column; I wouldn't be able to do that anymore, not because I'm not still a lefty, but because I no longer would be able to provide any answers for the problem that they put in front of me. 

For example, I wrote about illegal immigration; I really have no fucking idea what to do about that. I think Tom Tancredo and most of the Minutemen are racists, and so I'm against any cause that racists feel compelled to advocate; beyond that, I couldn't tell you.

Likewise, I'm voting for all Democrats next week, not necessarily because I think that they're just awesome, but because I think the people in charge are jackasses, and are killing people, stealing our money and lying about it. Am I for raising the minimum wage, or universal health care, or fair trade, or pulling out our troops? Shit, how am I supposed to know? At this point, I just want whoever is in charge to just leave us all alone.

I guess I am in favor of a Democratic agenda, even though a) they're probably not going to end up doing shit anyway and b) I'm a 19-year-old college sophomore studying journalism in central Pennsylvania, and I really wouldn't know any better; all I can go by is what I hear and see, and what I choose to believe or call bullshit on. You could be against all of those things that I mentioned and I certainly wouldn't accuse you of intellectual dishonesty.

So I have to finish writing this speech, and the more I read and learn, the exponentially more difficult it becomes to write the speech with any sort of conviction. I just hate it when people come up there and start giving their speech and it sounds like they have barely even though about it, they just went with the first thing that sounded good - and that's going to end up being me, tomorrow morning, because I don't really have a choice. The sad thing is that I doubt anyone will really notice or care all that much.  Half of the people in the class who have any interest in the issue will just accept whatever arguments I make as gospel truth, and half will think I'm full of shit, and no one will say anything about it.

My ethos is getting smaller and smaller by the day; it's shrinking like a piece of fruit that someone left out in the sun. I hate school."

"event","I have to go to class right now, but I was watching George Bush's speech on the television. He is at the United Nations, I guess. Why did the United Nations even let him waste their time? You'd think they would all get together and say ""You know, thanks for the offer, but New Zealand and Peru really have some good stuff this year, so we're gonna have to take a pass.""

I know that it's really not that funny, but I still laughed at him. What a hopeless guy. No one even pays attention to him anymore.

It's strange to think of a U.S. President as being completely irrelevant, yet that's really how it seems like.

Even the UN countries listening to the speech seem to be like ""Yeah, yeah, whatever."" Leaning back in their chairs, talking to the guy next to them, frowning, staring off into space.

I think the reason why watching a Bush speech is funny is that he really doesn't appear to understand what he's saying. Have you ever heard his answers when people ask him unscripted questions? None of his answers make any sense. When he reads a speech it's like some 8th grader doing a presentation on Vasco da Gama that he copied directly from the encyclopedia.

He is talking to the people of Darfur now. I don't think Darfur is a country, so I'm not sure they would be there. Also, anything Bush says about Darfur is basically spitting in the face of whoever is listening, since everyone obviously knows that he isn't planning on doing shit about it.

I think it would be fun to know where the two black guys on screen are from, and what they're talking about. I just picture like Liberia and the Central African Republic making jokes about Bush's weird facial expressions or something.

Watching this guy up here talking about peace and diplomacy and democracy, I feel like I would have the same feeling listening to Barry Bonds talk to a bunch of kids about staying off drugs. It's just like, who are you kidding, anyway?

After he finished he got a golf clap, not a birdie clap but a routine par clap.

I am late."

It makes it very easy to keep in touch with people and see what they are up to. I don't think it was necessary to expand it to high schools - I can tell already that it is spreading like wildfire at Salpointe now that some cool kids have their accounts - but all in all, it's a good thing to pass the time and keep up with your friends, particularly when you're someone like me and you didn't go to college with any of them.

Brent Musberger was his usual ridiculous self.<br /><br />A.J.&nbsp; Hawk sacked Brady Quinn, and Laura Quinn made a face.<br /><br />We also know that Laura Quinn isn't the brightest apple on the tree.<br /><br />So anyway, they got married this year, and Notre Dame went down to Atlanta to play Georgia Tech on Saturday.

"event","It has been raining for almost 24 hours now.

People have been saying that it's because we are catching the remnants of Tropical Storm Ernesto.

This is false. God, actually, is punishing Penn State.

God is punishing my school and its 79-year-old football coach, Joe Paterno, for having such a weak, pathetic home non-conference schedule this year.

Penn State goes to Notre Dame one week from today. But as for the remainder of the non-conference slate? Akron (today's opponent), Temple and...drumroll please...the Youngstown State Penguins. Come on. give us a Colorado State or Missouri, or maybe a Maryland or Washington.

And so it rains. I didn't go to the game, because I do not have season tickets. I do not wish to elaborate why I do not, except to say that demand is high.

However, it was really terrible outside, mid-50's, wet, windy, miserable, and so I watched it from the comfort of my dorm room.

Penn State won comfortably, and sloppily, 34-16. Two fumbles and a number of errant passes, but the defense was good. It's worth noting that Dan Connor played better than Paul Posluszny, who is overrated (which isn't his fault at all), but it was good to see that the new safeties and defensive linemen performed admirably.

Akron did the best they could, but they are Akron, and nothing will ever change that.

We now have a large amount of very fast, skilled recievers: Derrick Williams, Deon Butler, Terrell Golden, Jordan Norwood, A.J. Wallace, Chris Bell.

Our quarterback has a really, really big nose, but a very good arm, so I guess that evens out, except I fear that it (nose) might get broken at some point.

I am waiting for 10:15 ET to come around; Arizona plays BYU on TBS. I'm very excited for this Arizona football season; it's more fun, actually, than basketball season. The reverse is true at Penn State; PSU basketball, in my opinion, is more fun than PSU football.

The reason for this is because, simply put, it's not as fun rooting for a team who you expect to win pretty much every game. The corollary of this is that it isn't fun at all when you're watching a game and merely hoping that your team doesn't lose.

That was Arizona basketball the last two years; we're playing Oregon State or Washington, and everyone I know is just hoping, praying, that we don't lose, because we are supposed to win. If we lose, it sucks; if we win, we only did what we were supposed to. There are none of those crazy, unexpected, nonsensically glorious victories, like a Penn State team who started no one bigger than 6'6 going on the road to beat Dee Brown and Illinois last spring when a buzzer-beating Illinois three-pointer was waived off after five minutes of replay. Similarly, UA football has the UCLA game last year.

PSU football and UA basketball have their down years, but the prestige of their respective programs is such that ""big"" wins never happen anymore, unless it's a bowl game, or a rivalry game, or an important bowl/tournament game. And you know what? I'm going to go ahead and say it, that really sucks. UA basketball fans were miserable last year and the year before that, even though they won 20 games each of those seasons. That's just the way it is."

"event","<em>My name is Hov', OH, H-to-the-O-V<br />I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z<br />I guess even back then you can call me<br />CEO of the R-O-C</em><br /><br />Hello.<br /><br />My name is Dylan. I own a Hyundai, and my sister thinks it is ugly.<br /><br />She didn't say it to my face, but I can tell. I can definitely tell.<br /><br />It is kind of ugly. I have owned it for eight days. Oh well. It happens.<br /><br />I could have told her that my car thinks she is ugly, but that's a very childish thing to say, and everyone who reads this knows that I prefer to take the high road in situations like that.<br /><br />I am still alive. I don't update my live journal very much anymore. My writing was becoming very poor and it was making me sad, so I stopped. <br /><br />I hate how it looks now. Maybe I will get a new website or something. It depends if I remember how to write. I looked at some of the things I wrote a year ago and I do not even recognize the person who wrote them. I could not write like that if I tried.<br /><br />For whatever reason, everything has gradually become a lot less interesting - which makes a person's writing a lot more apathetic, and boring, and therefore pointless.<br /><br />Here are a few paragraphs to allow me to catch up a little bit, for record keeping purposes if nothing else. When I become a decrepit and senile bastard, I want to be able to look back on the year 2006 and remember what happened.<br /><br />Never mind. I will probably just lie about it, tell my grandson I was in the goddamn Peace Corps or the 10st Airborne division in Nazi Germany or something. He probably wouldn't figure it out until I was dead anyway. ""Grandpa, I didn't know you were 153 years old this year...""<br /><br />I did not get a job this summer. I did not really want a job, but I applied at 12-15 different businesses anyway and was not called back.<br /><br />I believe it could be because I have an armed robbery conviction on my record. I never was convicted of armed robbery, but it's possible that someone could have made a mistake.<br /><br />The one thing worth mentioning about my summer was the trip I went on in May. Two friends and I went to a bunch of different places. We drove 3800 miles in a big circle around the western United States.<br /><br />Five hours into the trip, Sproul left his cell phone at a rest stop. We played football and wiffle ball on Mission Beach. One day into the trip, Sproul lost his camera charger.<br /><br />We were in the live studio audience for the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. To this day I do not know why. One of the comedians was very funny; Craig Ferguson was moderately funny. The audience laughed at a lot of things that weren't funny. We had a bet on what the musical guest would be (there was none); Sproul had the best guess (Los Lonely Boys).<br /><br />We got a parking ticket on Hollywood Blvd. Our meter ran out when Sproul and Martin were looking for Chris Farley's star. Typical.<br /><br />We went to Six Flags Magic Mountain. I got stuck on the top of the fucking rotating tower for 20 minutes while Martin and Sproul searched the park for me. I rode on roller coasters, even though I hate roller coasters. We won a purple snake and named it Sissy.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, that goddamn purple snake was an appropriate symbol for the last three months, with its goofy plastic eyes, its stupid face, aesthetically horrifying color scheme; an utterly useless, absurd, toy that no innocent child would ever play with, much less develop any sort of attachment to. Yet somehow, to us it became both uproariously funny at times and later, totally invaluable to all three of us.<br /><br />Did you get that? I sure didn't.<br /><br />The Athletics beat the Giants 1-0. Barry Bonds had 713 home runs at the time. He struck out to end the game. Oakland is a very scary place; many people who live there are crazy. Those people drink a lot at baseball games, and they hate Barry Bonds, because he is a bitch. Needless to say, we had a great time.<br /><br />We got stuck in a snowstorm at the end of May on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. Our ignition failed on the north shore of Lake Tahoe.<br /><br />We played Mario Kart every night.<br /><br />We played golf at 5:30 PM in a municipal links course in Carson City. It was very windy. The last four holes or so were into the wind, so we would all hit our drives and they would travel about eighty yards and get caught up in the wind and blow back at us. It was like the British Open, except it was in Nevada, and there were no fans, and it wasn't a tournament, and all three of us are very poor golfers. I suck the least. I think i have about a 22 handicap.<br /><br />We stayed in Reno. This prompted Martin to say the line ""I don't wanna go home, I wanna go to Reno"" (Kingpin) at least 150 times. We had steak and eggs. I topped out at 109 mph on I-80 between Reno and Sparks.<br /><br />Martin and Sproul thought of a great idea: see how much water you can drink in the car until it becomes an unpleaseant overall experience. They each drank 3 liters of water each, which I believe is just over 100 ounces of water in one hour. Due to peer pressure, I joined in, even though I was driving. We stopped in Sparks and spent 45 minutes peeing. I went seven times. <br /><br />Martin almost ran into the back of a stationary cattle truck at 80 mph on the Nevada-Idaho border. He claimed that our brakes were bad. How full of shit is that? From that point on, we made sure everyone knew that ""Martin almost got us killed.""<br /><br />From Lake Tahoe to Idaho Falls, we started the car by playing a game I invented called ""Who Has the Magic Touch?"" each person was given a number of opportunities to fiddle with our failing ignition and start the car. Whoever had&nbsp; the ""Magic Touch"" was declared winner and driver of that segment of the trip.<br /><br />""Who Has the Magic Touch?"" ended in Idaho Falls, when no one had the Magic Touch, and our car was towed away.<br /><br />At the shop I mentioned to the mechanic that while he's at it, he should check the brakes, because they were making a weird sound. As it turns out, we had no brakes, and if we kept going we almost certainly would have eaten shit off a cliff in Colorado.<br /><br />Repairs were eight hundred dollars.<br /><br />We went to Yellowstone and played Pooh Sticks with Benz.<br /><br />We spent one night sleeping in the van outside of a Holiday Inn in Rock Springs, Wyoming. We walked to the Comfort Inn next door and ate their free breakfast.<br /><br />Hotels have the worst security. We got that much out of our trip.<br /><br />We played miniature golf in Ouray, and Martin almost inadvertantly got in a fight with an overweight mexican teenager and his friends at a carnival in Durango.<br /><br />I managed to get a really expensive hotel room in Pagosa Springs for 50 bucks because I said I had no money. The couple ahead of me at the front desk paid 175 for their double room, and I paid 50, because ""that's all i can afford"". The self-righteous hotel clerk told me that his motto was ""don't let people sleep out in the cold."" I paid with a credit card.<br /><br />If you are thinking of moving to Gallup, New Mexico, I am going to go ahead and tell you right now that I believe you should strongly reconsider.<br /><br />We got back after eleven days.<br /><br />I go back to Penn State in one week. I have read one and a half books this summer, and I have run about ten miles. I have played at least 750 times on Luigi Raceway. I have had two bottles of beer. I have been to zero concerts; I have, however, watched two episodes of Dawson's Creek and one episode of The Hills. I have a 1-0 record in tennis, and I was nearly broken up with once over a round at Dell Urich. You can bet that was a fun afternoon.<br /><br />I have no roommate, one car, no parking permit, no class on Fridays, no football season tickets, one desire to go to the PGA Tour 84 Lumber Classic in September, and five pairs of pants.<br /><br />I haven't quite decided yet, but I am leaning towards taking Sissy with me."

"event","<font size=""1""><a href=""http://www.azstarnet.com/dailystar/news/136113"">I read this </a>in the paper this morning.<br /><br />It just doesn't seem fair.<br /><br />As a runner for Salpointe we all got to see the McGregor twins up close and personal at least 5-6 times a year, and you would always see them in the paper on Thursday morning as as 1-2 in whatever dual meet they ran the day before. In the track one would maybe win the 1600 and the other the 3200. Emily was always better until senior year, when Valerie won state in cross country - although I guess that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />I saw them run for two years. Everyone knew the McGregor twins, or at least knew of them. I didn't know the girls, never talked to them; I was only an idiot freshman and sophomore trying to make sure I didn't lose to them in the 3200, and at that time I'm sure they both at a few inches on me at least. Those girls were quite an amusing, and intimidating, sight to see, at least from my perspective.<br /><br />I think everyone got a kick out of watching them at a meet, both on and off the track;, off, you'd be jogging around and all of a sudden there they are, two tall, skinny, pretty blonde girls warming up together, with matching ponytails and facial features, and then after the race you'd probably see them smiling and giving an interview to some dumbass reporter from the Daily Star or maybe Jessie Vanderson; on, you'd have the whole kicking everyone's ass by a million miles, in those shades, and you wouldn't know who was ahead or what was going on, except that one was first and the other was second. In cross country, the only time I saw them get split up was when this girl from Buena beat Emily at the finish line at regionals their senior year.<br /><br />The twins were always the subject of some good, clean, old fashioned joking amongst ourselves. We had two sets of twins on our team, and, in spite of everyone's countless obvious suggestions for pickup lines, I don't think anything ever came of it. I take that back, actually, I remember when we went to San Diego my sophomore year, when both of our teams were waiting in line (Salpointe was identifiable by our gay maroon polo shirts) to get into the Spaghetti Factory, and Jason managed to have a decent-lengthed conversation with them - if I remember right, I feel like Collette ended up being his wingman.<br /><br />We laughed when <a href=""http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/currents/Content?oid=oid:46984"">copies of the Tucson Weekly </a>were being passed out at the 5A South regionals at track. The consensus was that Valerie was the more attractive one, although to be honest, I was never in my life able to tell the difference.<br /><br />The last time I saw either one of them was on a run my senior year, training for Foot Locker with Bryce. We were running around the U of A and just as we exited the football stadium, we caught a glimpse of Emily, who by then had transferred back to Arizona, running by herself. That she was alone was somewhat of a strange sight, but even still, neither of us had the balls talk to her or even say hi. To me, and my teammates, the McGregor twins, together, always had some kind of aura of celebrity, of uniqueness, of personality abo</font><font size=""1"">ut them.<br /></font><font size=""1""><br /></font><font size=""1"">And that is the way it will stay.<br /></font>"

"event","whenever i go on myspace and look at profiles i always end up really angry. i don't know who exactly i'm angry at. i guess on the surface it's toward the people who made them, but it would seem pretty absurd that I would get angry at people i don't even know for doing some normal activity.<br /><br />i don't have any other explanation, though, so i guess that's just what it must be. i am beginning to conclude that i will have no other choice but to live the rest of my life in the face of near total misanthropy.<br /><br />people buy hats and jerseys of teams just because they think it looks cool even though they've clearly never even fucking seen a baseball or basketball game.<br /><br />girls dressing up like twelve-dollar whores. that's real attractive. now everyone wants to have sex with you. that should get you a long way. what ever happened to having an imagination? no one needs one anymore. you're a sophomore. you don't actually have to imagine the hot chick in your class taking her clothes off in front of you because you already have it, right in front of your computer. everyone is such a goddamn spoiled piece of shit these days.<br /><br />while we're talking about girls, i realize that this is not an original complaint, but this shit with the sunglasses. apparently now the cool sunglasses are the ones that cover the entire top half of the girl's goddamn face. there definitely hasn't been a more annoying and frustrating fashion trend since i've been alive. i guess everyone is afraid to show other people what they look like, we've all become jaded enough that everyone has to go outside pretending to be the goddamn princess of monaco.<br /><br />i want to throw up because everything is just so easy. you don't have to go out and have fun anymore because every time you turn your face a different direction someone is trying to force feed you. <em>promiscuous boy, you already know that i'm all yours, what you waiting for?</em> turn on the tv and someone will give you a lap dance. everything we read and watch and hear is all paper mache, you take 3 extra goddamn minutes to try to understand it better and it's all just nonsense.<br /><br /><br />9381 times a day someone calls from bally total fitness or directv or qwest or omaha steaks wanting me or my dad or mom to buy something. i hate phones. honestly, i wish they never would have been invented. not just cell phones, all phones. if you call 911 and it wasn't really an emergency, you should have your fucking phone taken away for life. you should just be refused service from then on until the day you die.<br /><br />american idol. just die already. someone on the show, just have a stroke. walk into oncoming traffic.<br /><br />in spite of all this entertainment that has been created for the sole purpose of distracting people from living, everyone is still bored.<br /><br />my two favorite websites by far are espn.com and wikipedia. mostly everything else sucks. i go to the biggest political blog, daily kos, every day. most of it is just old or angry people bitching about how bad bush is. it does absolutely nothing for me. everyone i know realizes after six years that bush is a fucking moron, even if it hurts their pride too much to admit it. he's an absolute retard, and the guys he hired to run the country are a bunch of liars and crooks. they all steal money from us and use it to kill other people and take their money. you're spending what, like 918158 billion dollars in iraq? why the fuck should anyone here have to pay for this shit? you want to do it, you should pay for it yourself. instead they take our money and use it to destroy iraq, then they take more of our money and give it to the companies they own to rebuild it. that's some good business right there. everyone in this country let them do it, so we deserve what we get. you voted for bush, you deserve to lose. you didn't vote, you deserve to lose. i give the bush dudes credit for winning, even if they perpetrated a massive fraud upon 300 million people.<br /><br />rap music is a fucking joke. they put all these douchebags in front of a camera and give them a million dollars and tell them to say as much ridiculous shit as they can over a beat by Jazze Pha or whatever and everyone buys it. it's unbelievably racist. rap music makes white people think that black people are a bunch of dumb fucking criminals, which is a load of bullshit. i wrote some email a couple of years ago to the manager of hot 98.3 and asked him why the hell he's so willing to play all this terrible music but not the roots or talib kweli or blackalicious or any hip-hop music with an ounce of depth or creativity, and he said that he doesnt play it because no one likes it. it's the other way around, no one likes it because they never play it. people will always buy anything that you sell hard enough, no matter how good or bad it happens to be. you can promote a really really shitty movie and still make money off it, even though the movie sucks. that's just how it works. people like easy shit even if it sucks. one of the reasons why people are extremely unimpressive.<br /><br />poker is terrible. everyone is the man in poker apparently. honestly, i'd rather lose my money getting mugged on the street. at least then the other guys earned it instead of taking it by some absolute miracle of probability.<br /><br />i don't hate people who can't read, i hate people who can't read and are proud of it.<br /><br />i don't hate fat people, i hate people who are fat but do nothing about it and try to collect fucking disability insurance and take up 7 seats on a goddamn airplane and are stunned to find out that mcdonalds and the WB network both give you heart disease. i hate fat people who claim that dieting and exercising doesn't work for them.<br /><br />i hate people who are perfectly willing to be religious when it suits them but if it's inconvenient then hey fuck you, jesus. if jesus came back to earth he would be kicking so many people's asses right now. <br /><br />i have a problem with killing people. i don't have a problem with beating the crap out of someone. all wars should be fought with bare fists. the occasional 2x4 or folding chair would be permitted. i had a funny thought the other day. they were playing that song by panic at the disco on KFMA after the ""new rock on kfma"" promo, and i thought to myself ""wow, i could really kick the crap out of most of the people who listen to panic at the disco."" it made me laugh. that's like rock music or something. i'm some weak skinny kid and i could still manhandle the majority of those fans. same with like all-american rejects. get the hell out of here.<br /><br />it would suck being a parent aroudn this time. every time you turn on the news or talk to another person they try to scare you into thinking your kid is gonna die at any moment. you might have a a defective crib or a fucked up stroller. there's a child molester 17 blocks from here, better not let the kids outside. don't let them drown in the pool. watch out for downed power lines. does he have sars? does she have west nile? is there mercury in the vaccine to make him autistic? e-coli? botulism? does he ahve jesus in his life? has he been looking up internet porn? is she meeting an online predator on myspace? are you going to be a victim of identity theft and lose your life savings and their college fund? what about your 401k? are they getting enough training to be the next pete sampras and mia fucking hamm? you better move them to florida to join the IMG youth academy. do they have low self esteem or attention deficit disorder or depression? better start feeding them these pills, and these ones, and these ones. better save up that 20 grand to send them to private school so they don't get shot by a black kid or stabbed by a mexican kid in the public schools. and make sure they have nike shoes and under armour and limited too and all of that other bullshit otherwise they'll get made fun of for not being cool. right?<br /><br /><br />i'd like to buy some land in oregon or something. buy a little house and some land and have my own little farm and maybe there's a town 25 miles away where i can drive up there once every two weeks and get groceries. the rest of the time i could just walk around. it wouldn't be hot. maybe sometimes i would run. i could do little wood carvings or something. go into the forest and collect firewood.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Today, or yesterday I guess, was Alycia's birthday.

Apparently it really sucked. She had to work 9 hours, she got yelled at for something that wasn't really her fault, and if you ask her, she'll also say that her boyfriend ditched her to go bowling once he realized that he was supposed to meet her and 9 of her friends at the sushi bar on Friday and not today.

I promised that I would write her an entry for her birthday in addition to her other present. I think it's fair, after all, this is a livejournal, where you're supposed to write about the things that happen in your life, not just gay sports analysis and whining about how much Bush sucks and I hate my life.

Alycia sometimes comments on here when I whine about how no one comments, so she puts one on just to make me feel better, and it's time she had her due:

1. She is way smart and uses it

You have to be smart to get a 3.7 gpa at the University of Pennsylvania. You can't just be one of those kids who studies really hard and gets A's by memorizing everything while not understanding what you're learning. You actually have to be smart.

Being smart is a really attractive quality in a person. So is doing well. I get a huge kick out of it when she calls me and tells me about all the psychology material that she learned in class that day, even though she might not think so. She probably gets the wrong idea because most of it goes over my head, and all I can say is ""Uh huh"" or ""Wow, that's interesting.""

Another advantage is that we can have meaningful conversations about things. She will understand most of what I'm saying, even though she might not give a rat's ass about whatever I am talking about.

2. She is a very pretty girl

She came over to my house a few weeks ago. After she left, I was talking to my sister, who said ""You know, your girlfriend keeps getting prettier."" That sums up my feelings quite well.

3a. ""Hiiiiii""
3b. ""Yay""
3c. ""I'm excited""

4. Such a girl

She's afraid of bugs, and the dark, and big dogs, shopping is probably her favorite thing to do, she wears tank tops and skirts and makeup sometimes and likes dresses, she thinks golf is absolutely retarded, she watches General Hospital (even though I think that's more of an old lady thing) and Grey's Anatomy and Coach and Chanel and The O.C. She doesn't try to be a guy, which is a road that a lot of girls seem to be taking these days. She even types with girly font on her computer and shortens full words to u and 2 and 4. She was a cheerleader, which is cute, in spite of my opinion that cheerleading blows.

5. She let me use up all of her guest meals when I went to visit her at Penn

6. She's easy to pick up and carry around

7. She doesn't swear. She said some mild swear word once, ass or damn or something, and it was the most embarrassed I've ever seen her, even though I didn't help my laughing and making fun of her. She is classy. She doesn't marinate herself on the weekends. She works out. She is classy. She's just a high-class girl.

8. She's responsible and she always does what she's supposed to

She is the most reliable person I have ever met. In contrast, I am lazy, sporadic and highly unreliable to hold up my end of the deal. That must drive her out of her mind, yet she usually lets me off the hook eventually if I screw up.

9. She always does the best she can at whatever she's doing

&nbsp;She always gives a full effort. Again, I don't know how she deals with me, who is the opposite, who will try only as hard as I need to get by. She works hard at everything, whether it's reading some dumb book for class or scooping ice cream or taking care of 15 two-year-olds for eight hours a day. The last time I had a job was August 2002, and I have a 3.21 at the nation's 49th rated university.

10. She makes me happy

Whenever there's a big day, like Christmas or Valentine's or my birthday, she always goes all out to be as cute as possible. She makes these goodie bags with all sorts of small toys and different things that she thinks I would like, while I just try to buy her off because I have no creativity whatsoever. She also makes homemade cards out of construction paper and markers. It doesn't get any better than that. Also, once in a while she'll laugh at some stupid joke I made, which is always nice, even if she's faking it. Sometimes she just laughs at me for no reason. I enjoy it.

11. She gets jealous if I ever mention something about another girl, so sometimes I do it on purpose just to press her buttons and she doesn't hold it against me, even though she is now convinced that I have a thing for blondes

12. She took me back after I broke up with her for no reason

Writing this list makes me feel like a huge douchebag, and rightly so. That was not a good decision.

13. She makes me a better person

She has made me nicer. I think I have had a negative effect on her, which I feel bad about. Occasionally she'll pick up one of my typical bad, misanthropic habits or attitudes for a while and it makes me sad. Overall though most of the rubbing off has been on me from her, and thank god for that.

14. She doesn't mind that I have social anxiety and am a complete dork

This is pretty self explanatory. I must be such a liability to take around places. Some boyfriend who stares at the ground and mumbles incoherently to all of your friends. So awkward. yet she continues to press on, including this friday, which I'm sure will be another crushing blow in my attempts to appear friendly or personable.

15. She doesn't lie, at least not about anything important

One thing that makes me laugh is that she doesn't remember me from middle school, even though I was in like 9 of her classes and we were in the same home room as well as being right next to each other in the alphabet for two full years. I never really talked to her, but she could have at least lied to give me a false set of memories about how cool I was in middle school. Nope.

16. She puts up with way too much
 
 Girls like anniversaries, especially important ones. The one year anniversary, as I was well aware of at the time, is one of the big ones for a couple. This is one of the most obvious things I've ever written. Anyway, for my one year anniversary, I played video games with three of my friends and made her wait in her car at Grant and Swan for me to finish up and drive over there.
 
 When you put it that way, that's really just an awful thing to do to someone, particularly someone you've been dating for a year.
 
 She was understandably very upset with me, and I deserved it. Somehow, she managed to move past it, even though I am sure I will hear about it when my two year anniversary (hopefully) comes around. The point is, lucky for me she is willing to live with the fact that I am a moron, and I am constantly trying to make up for the mean things I do to her.



She is now 19.

And I say yay to that, and yay for making me a part of her life, and yay for being always being a bright spot in mine."

"event","I live near River and Craycroft, and I turned out of my neighborhood onto Craycroft yesterday when I was driving my brother somewhere. I'm talking on the phone and I see a cop on the side of the road, near the construction that they're doing. <br /><br />""Hang on,"" I told Chris over the phone, ""I gotta put on my seat belt.""<br /><br /> I drive past the cop, who immediately turns on her lights. <br /><br />""Hang on,"" I added, ""I'm going to have to call you back, I just got pulled over."" I look at my brother and reassure him by rolling my eyes and giving him a quick&nbsp; ""Goddd.""<br /><br />I put my phone down, pull into the dirt and turn off my engine. The lady walks up to me. I realize now that the speed limit is like -7 mph in a construction zone, and I was definitely going faster than that.<br /><br />""Hi.""<br /><br />""Hi.""<br /><br />""Do you know why I pulled you over?""<br /><br />I decide that I would rather not put the effort into talking a bunch of bullshit and playing innocent. ""Yes, I'm pretty sure I was speeding through the construction zone.""<br /><br />""Do you know what the speed limit is?""<br /><br />""Uh, I think it's 25 or so.""<br /><br />""Yes, it's 25. Do you know how fast you were going?""<br /><br />""Yeah, I was going around 39 or 40.""<br /><br />""Yes, you were going 42. Can I see your license and registration please?""<br /><br />""Sure."" I hand all of it to her.<br /><br />""Is this car licensed to you?""<br /><br />""No, it's under my dad's name.""<br /><br />""And do you have any prior arrests or speeding tickets?""<br /><br />""No, I've never gotten a ticket before.""<br /><br />""Okay, well let me run this through the computer, you're probably looking at a warning here if you don't have anything on your record.""<br /><br />She comes back five minutes later. ""Okay, well, it looks like you're clean, so I'm not going to give you a ticket.<br /><br />""Thanks, I appreciate it.""<br /><br />""You're lucky you were only going 42, if you had been going over 45 that would be criminal speeding"" (this is what my sister got after going 68 in a 35 zone on Speedway) ""and then I'd have to arrest you, and I wouldn't want to have to do that.""<br /><br />""Oh, well, that's fortunate, I guess I've learned my lesson.""<br /><br />""Good, here's a written warning.""<br /><br />""Thanks, I'll hang it up on my wall."" (why the hell would I say that? I wasn't smiling or anything, I must have sounded like such a prick)<br /><br />""Take care.""<br /><br />So that was a fun incident. The funny part of the whole deal was that I clearly saw the cop sitting there, she was just so obvious, I even went so far as to put my fucking seatbelt on. Yet I'm not smart enough to like slow down in the construction zone, one whose speed limit I was perfectly aware of. Luckily, there were no consequences, other than I have some written warning on my dashboard now. I haven't looked at it yet, but maybe I will hang it up on my wall at some point if I ever take it out of the van.<br /><br />This is only a day after some disastrous incident on Alvernon. I was driving home from Randolph, we had just beat out a storm to finish 18 holes and so it was cloudy and windy, so I opened the windows to cool off the car.<br /><br />Immediately shit starts flying everywhere. Papers are all over the place and after 4.8 seconds, before I can get the windows all the way up, two paper items fly out the driver's side window.<br /><br />The first item is pages 1 and 2 of my brother's wilderness adventure instructions (he is going on a backpacking trip in a few weeks). I asked him about it when he got home and he said he didn't need it.<br /><br />The second item was a ten dollar bill.<br /><br />Before I went golfing, I saw it on the floor between the driver and passenger seats. I thought to myself, hey, I already have enough money in my wallet to pay, so I don't need to take the ten out of the car. I don't want to lose it or anything.<br /><br />Little did I know.<br /><br />I hope some homeless guy found it and bought himself something that made him happy. I couldn't care less if it was a sandwich or a forty of Mickey's, as long as it made his life a little better then that's fine with me. Odds are that it went down a gutter or something, but I can always hope that it like saved some guy's life.<br /><br />I have been playing solid if unspectacular golf lately. I tied my personal best with a 44-41-85 on Dell Urich on Tuesday, then had an uneventful 43 yesterday. Sproul shot a personal best and beat me by a shot. He putted the lights out.<br /><br />I have been having arm problems lately, probably from home run derby. I am so goddamn weak. I probably tore my wrist and my rotator cuff.

"event","Yesterday I was going to write an entry that began ""The date is 6-6-06, so what better way to celebrate than by writing about women's sports?""<br /><br />Then I realized, among other things, that it would be in bad taste, so I decided to hold off a day. Now that I've been writing for a few minutes, I realize this is going to be too long. Oh well.<br /><br />First, I should fully disclose that I watched the women's college world series. That's softball. This is way out of character for me, but once I saw the Texas game, I managed to tune in for the four UA games after that.<br /><br />Two reasons:<br /><br />One, softball is a very bizarre, peculiar sport. Huge girls line up against each other and try to hit a huge ball with a huge bat on a tiny field. If a player has any speed whatsoever, she bats left-handed and her goal of every at-bat is to take a running start and smash the ball into the ground to create a high-bouncing play for the shortstop, because 96% of the time the girl is at first base by the time the shortstop fields the ball. Arizona has three very fast girls who do this quite well, so they had more runners on base than all the other teams, which eventually led to them scoring more runs than anyone else.<br /><br />In addition, the pitcher is a girl usually over six-feet, who stands on a mound situated&nbsp; about 8 feet away from home plate. Softball pitchers have figured out how to throw a number of strange pitches - the self-expanatory rise ball and drop ball, a screw ball, a change-up, a fastball - and throw most of them over 60 mph. As such, every batter, even the best&nbsp; in the game, have very little chance to get a legitimate, non-slap hit.The UA pitcher gave up one run in the last 28 innings she threw. Again, this is an excellent formula for victory.<br /><br />Also, maybe it was just unfortunate luck on my part, but softball players seem more prone to errors, particularly in important situations, than, well, every other group of athletes, except maybe women's basketball players. In the first Tennessee game, the shortstop for Tennessee booted a ground ball and dropped a pop fly right to her. In the next game, the second baseman dropped an easy toss from the shortstop, the third baseman threw it over the first baseman's head, one outfielder biffed on two ground balls and let two runners advance. <br /><br />In the Texas game, with Arizona down 1-0, the Texas catcher bit on the lamest, most obvious little league play ever - the old first and third double steal. The girl on first took off, instead of faking the throw or looking the runner on third back, the catcher threw all the way down and let the girl on third score easily. How do you not see that coming? <br /><br />Arizona won both games of the championship series easily, mostly because they have a good pitcher and Northwestern can't throw or catch. They made 6 errors in two games. I don't know if terrible defense is a staple of college softball, or just a fluke, so I'm trying very hard not to judge. And Arizona was fine defensively, so maybe it's just coaching or something.<br /><br />So to summarize, the first reason why I watched the WCWS is because softball is baseball's tall, clumsy, slightly crazy, moderately attractive younger sister. Wow, I was trying to be nice, now that I read it again it didn't come out quite that way.<br /><br />Now, I didn't have a second reason for watching this weekend. But let's just say, hypothetically, that I was someone else, a different person who wasn't in a happy, committed relationship, who didn't get in trouble for talking about other girls.<br /><br />In that case, my second reason would be Caitlin Lowe.<br /><br /><img src=""http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g243/seahawk88/caitlinlowe.jpg"" alt="""" /> <br /><br />Game was tied 0-0 when a girl from Tennessee hits one deep to left center. Caitlin Lowe is playing center field. She goes back at full speed to her right and lunges at the ball, gets a glove on it, but the fence gets in the way, so both she crashes into it and goes flying over the fence.<br /><img src=""http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g243/seahawk88/lowecatch.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><font size=""1""><br />(montage courtesy of me, with help from Alt+Print Screen and Paint)</font><br /><br />If that isn't sexy, I don't know what is. <br /><br />Crashing into fences is sexy, and so are stolen bases, and diving catches, and stretching singles into doubles. I'm not too big on the whole eye black thing. There's no reason to make yourself look like Mark Grace or Brady Anderson out there. Nonetheless, I have become a very big Caitlin Lowe fan. She is what you might call an all-around player. And she's only a junior.<br /><br />This is not really relevant to anything, but I think there's a general rule of thumb for dating softball girls. If you're interested, stick with outfielders, shortstops and second basemen. Both corner infielders are (usually) men, as are most catchers and pitchers, Jennie Finch being a blatant exception of course. But even she's 6'1, so if you're even going to think about it you better be some tall dude.<br /><br />Most of the cuter girls are right up the middle though, as well as the corner outfield spots and pinch runners.<br /><br />Okay, that's enough for now."

""<br /><br />I don't ever want to be mentioned in the same breath as Ricky Williams as a football player. He's a disgrace to the game. The man doesn't deserve to play football. He should go on with his life and treat his drug addictions or go do whatever he wants to do. He's been suspended from the National Football League on multiple occasions. Doesn't anybody have any class anywhere? For gosh sakes, let the kid go do what he wants to do. He doesn't want to play football,"" Theismann, who is part of ESPN's Monday Night Football announcing crew, said. <br /><br />Williams was suspended by the NFL for the entire 2006 season following a fourth positive drug test. But the Dolphins gave him permission to play this year in the CFL, and he signed with Toronto on Sunday.  <br /><br />Theismann, while calling Williams a ""good kid"" said he believes that the running back has had too many chances. <br /><br />""We have rules in the National Football League. It's real simple. Don't do drugs and you can play. It's a privilege to be able to play professional football. It's not some rite of passage. He's insulted the <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/clubhouse?team=mia"">Miami Dolphins</a> after they took him back and gave him a chance to play. Now he insults the intelligence of everybody that thinks that doing drugs is OK. To me, it's the wrong message to send to kids. It's the wrong thing to be doing, and the Toronto Argonauts have embarrassed themselves as an organization signing him,"" Theismann said.  <br /><br />Toronto has won the Grey Cup -- the CFL championship -- 15 times, most recently in 2004. The Argonauts were 11-7 last season.<br /><br /></em>Someone needs to get off his high horse. <br /><br />Thanks, Joe, we all remember that you won the Super Bowl MVP in 1982. You were also part of one of the worst broadcasting teams of all time on Sunday Night Football. You also love Ray Lewis, which is an outstanding measure of hypocrisy if I've ever seen one. This <a href=""http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2143768&amp;type=story"">""letter"" to TO and Randy Moss</a> is pathetic.<br /><br />In summary, you suck at life.<br /><br />""The wrong message to send to kids"" is either the right message to kids, or no message to kids at all. If a kid sees Ricky Williams on TV, he's not going to know anything about the NFL drug policy or whatever.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you're the kid's parent, you have a choice as to what message you want to give to your kid from Ricky Williams: one, that he's a quitter, he's a scumbag, and he's crazy because the weed got to his head; or two, you can talk to him about compassion, forgiveness, the value of giving someone a second chance, how important it is to find out what you want to do with your life and how to pick an occupation that makes you truly happy, regardless of how talented you are.<br /><br />""The wrong message to kids"" is such an unbelievable copout. Theismann should try to stick his hand a little bit deeper in the cliche jar and try to pull out a better one. This is yet another former player (Notre Dame, Redskins quarterback) who has the National Football League as the biggest and brightest object floating around in the center of his universe.<br /><br />(As a sidenote, I got back from my trip on Saturday night, but I don't want to write about it until I can get the pictures uploaded onto my computer.)"

The second sports video game I ever owned, right after I bought Triple Play 97, was NCAA Football 98 for PC. I got it for Christmas from my parents, and I played it for hours on end until school started in January, when I had to put it away because I was grounded from the computer by my parents for getting bad grades.<br /> <br /> I always played with Arizona - Keith Smith, Trung Candidate, Jeremy McDaniel, Dennis Northcutt, Marcus Bell, Chris McAllister - that was quite a year indeed - but my little brother, who was about 7 or 8 at the time (and ironically has no interest in sports whatsoever anymore) wanted to play too, so he picked Texas. Luckily for him, they had Ricky Williams, who was unstoppable. My brother called the same play - Toss Right - every time, and Ricky would either outrun the entire secondary for an 80 yard TD or truck a few linebackers, cut back, and run for a more exciting 80 yard TD. On the hardest level, my brother, who knew little about football, was beating the best teams (UCLA, Florida State, Tennessee) 98-7 and running for 650 yards a game with Ricky, who won the Heisman in real life that year.<br /> <br /> Everyone knew from the beginning that he was a weird guy, from the SI cover when he posed with Ditka in a wedding dress, to doing interviews with his helmet on, to hiring Master P as his agent and getting a horrible rookie deal, his dreads, etc, etc. Then two years ago, he retired at the age of 27, with little explanation. The news articles said he quit for a combination of reasons: he was getting suspended for smoking pot, he wanted to travel the world, he just plain didn't care about football and didn't want to play anymore.<br /> <br /> This was in July of 2004, and on every TV and sports radio station he was being ripped by everyone, from sportswriters to former players to teammates. He quit on his team. He is the lowest of the low. He is a horrible teammate. Pothead. Crazy person. Unreliable. Selfish. No heart.<br /> <br /> A year later, he came back to the Dolphins, sat out 4 games, then backed up Ronnie Brown. He was accepted immediately by his teammates and his new coach, ran for 750 yards and a few touchdowns.<br /> <br /> Failed his 4th drug test, lost his appeal a month ago, and was suspended from the NFL for a year. Got ripped again by Skip Bayless and the guys from Around the Horn and whoever the hell else felt the need to chime in about how they were right about Ricky the first time.<br /> <br /> Today he signed with the Toronto Argonauts with the CFL. I watched the press conference. Ordinarily I would have turned the channel, but listening to Ricky talk was so interesting to me that I kept it on for another half hour until the NFL Network ended the feed.<br /> <br /> When Ricky spoke, it was about 10% football and 90% other. He mentioned helping the team be successful, mentioned his new coach, his teammates, giving it 100% on the field, being thankful for the opportunity, and looking forward to returning to the Dolphins in 2007. This is what you would hear in a prototypical press conference when a new player comes to a team, so that really wasn't extraordinary in any way.<br /> <br /> What I gathered from the rest of the things he said and the way he said them was that Ricky Williams is about as far away, personality wise, from a stereotypical professional athlete as you can get. He was shy and talked quietly. He would make a remark, everyone would chuckle even though he wasn't trying to be funny, just honest, and he would get this small, sheepish grin on his face while he waited for everyone to calm down again. (For example, when someone asked him if he was going to be drug tested by the Toronto organization, he said with a straight face that the NFL was already testing him about 10 times a month, so he thought that they pretty much had it covered.)<br /> <br /> The thing that struck me the most was how unbelievably honest and down to earth the guy was when the writers asked him for various explanations for the things he had done in the past. When a guy asked him if the reason why he was playing this year instead of sitting out was financial (he owes the Dolphins $8.6 million for breaching his contract in 04) he hesitated and then said ""...you obviously make money playing football than you do sitting at home.""<br /> <br /> He didn't mention at all dominating the league, or leading the league in rushing or touchdowns, or even winning a championship.<br /> <br /> It was obvious that he didn't care. He doesn't care about football at all, he could give a shit about how many yards he runs for or whether he wins any awards or whatever. This guy was and still is one of the best ten guys in the world at taking the football and gaining yardage against other players, and he was arguably the greatest college running back of all time at Texas. And after listening to him for a half hour I could tell that he couldn't care less about what he was doing or what people thought about him.<br /> <br /> When he retired two years ago, he said&nbsp; ""I just don't want to be in this business anymore. I was never strong enough to not play football, but I'm strong enough now. I've considered everything about this. Everyone has thrown every possible scenario at me about why I shouldn't do this, but they're in denial. I'm happy with my decision. I'm finally free. I can't remember ever being this happy.""<br /> <br /> While he was away, he said <span class=""body"">""I'm closer to being happy. I'm doing things that make me happy. In football I loved to practice and I loved to play, but I hated to be in meetings, hated to talk to the media, hated to have cameras in my face, hated to sign autographs. I hated to do all those things.</span>""<br /> <br /> At the press conference he talked about his year away from football, how he traveled all over the world, sleeping in tents in Australia and India, reading books. When a Canadian reporter asked him to describe himself, he called himself a ""seeker"", saying that he was a guy who had all of the material possessions very early in his life, realized soon afterwards that all of the money and fame and security meant nothing to him, and who up until a year and a half ago felt unfulfilled and confused about his life. He said he was someone searching for himself, searching for God, searching for inner peace, all of those things fit a description of him.<br /> <br /> I don't know why I found the whole thing so fascinating, but it struck a chord. Here's a guy who is rich and famous, a person with born with unbelievable physical talent, a guy who played pro baseball and pro football, the latter at the higest possible level. A guy who was the best in the world at what he did, a guy with millions of dollars and all the notoriety that came along with being a pro athlete, a high profile life. And he hated it so much that he quit. He came back after a year because as it turned out, he no longer had any money, and he knew that a) money enabled him to do the things he wanted to do in his life, and b) he now understood the good things that could come from playing again, on both himself, in the joy of running between the tackles, and the people around him, who might be positively influenced by his success and work ethic. It's really, really strange to hear someone like Ricky, when your entire life you've been watching athletes who are totally, relentlessly committed to their sport, not just physical dedication but what it really meant to them to win or be an All-Star or whatever.<br /> <br /> To me, it put a lot of things into perspective, at least as a fan of sports themselves. Seeing a guy like Ricky walk out onto the field in an Argonauts uniform and win games for them, even though I have the background knowledge that he doesn't care all that much about what happens in the end. It clashes to a mind-boggling degree with the fundamental nature of football itself, which is two teams with eleven men lining up opposite each other and trying to hit each other as hard as they can, regardless of the threat of severe physical injury.<br /> <br /> It's crazy when you think about it. Ricky Williams has caught more shit than 99.9% of people will ever experience in their lives, simply because he treats football like a regular job instead of the all-consuming driving force in his life or the most important thing that he will do while he was alive on Earth. The guy quit his job because he was sick of it, and walked away from everything even though he was the best at what he did. Why is that perfectly okay for a normal person to do, but unacceptable and pathetic for Ricky Williams? How can the sports world be so callous, or ignorant, as to condemn a guy who is actually aware that there might be other, and perhaps vastly more important, things in life than playing football?<br /><br />I love watching, and playing, sports more than anyone could ever know. I love the drama and the difficulty and the competition and the unpredictability and the celebration of how great people really can be at what they do, and the cheering and the sounds and the scoreboard and the trophies.<br /><br />Ricky Williams works harder than anyone. He plays harder than anyone. He is (obviously) a terrific player. He doesn't want to be a football star. He doesn't want to be in the spotlight. He has been trying to balance the weight of the expectations of everyone around him with his own desire to figure out what really matters in life for the better part of a decade, succeeding at times, failing in others.<br /><br />It saddens me to see how difficult it is for everyone to just leave him alone."

"event","Around February or March, I decided that I was sick and tired of eating shit for breakfast at school, sick and tired of an 8-10 record, sick and tired of losing to Purdue. Two of my friends agreed, so we decided that we would do something fun when school ended.<br /><br />So I thought that we should take a trip. <br /><br />Not just a trip to Phoenix for the day or anything, but a real trip, a trip to end all trips, a trip that in both length and creativity would put shame to all other trips before it.<br /><br />And so this is what it ended up looking like, assuming that my 1997 Chrysler Town and Country doesn't not make it:<br /><br /><img width=""583"" height=""755"" src=""http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g243/seahawk88/west1897.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />One of the reasons I don't update anymore is because my life is so goddamn boring. I'm not complaining, because it's obviously my fault, but that's just the way it is. Making fun of other people at length gets quite old after a while, no one cares about what I think about sports, or what happened at the Talib Kweli concert, or the de facto position I have taken as the recruiting coordinator for my sister, who is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life and where she wants to play soccer two years from now.<br /><br />So at least I will say this about the next ten days or so - at least they won't be boring. Anytime you drive to a bunch of places that you have no idea what the hell you're supposed to be doing or where you're supposed to be going, hilarity/adventure/disaster ensues. Since we will be visiting about 8-10 areas of the country that have that potential (San Diego, LA/Anaheim, Six Flags, the Bay Area, Yosemite, Tahoe, Yellowstone, Flaming Gorge, the Rocky Mountains), the least I can do is write about something moderately interesting or entertaining that I am a part of.<br /><br />What makes this trip more ""unpredictable"" (unpredictablity is a my nice way of saying utter disarray) than others is that aside from the first night, we have no idea where we're sleeping, or eating, or how far we're driving. This is, depending on your point of view, a way to heighten the excitement and<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;""> spontaneity of the trip, or a lazy and unthinkably stupid move.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br />As such, I do not know when or where I will have the internet available, but I will document what happens regardless of how much access I have. I will backdate it or something if necessary. I have not written anything in quite a while and as you can tell I am rusty. At any rate, I guess we'll see how it goes.<br /><br />We are leaving at 6:30 tomorrow. I will be back (probably) on Saturday, May 27. I have no idea if it will be any fun or not, but even if it isn't, I'll still probably have a few more facebook pictures. Who the hell cares about that? Apparently a lot of people, so never mind.<br /><br />I am going to miss Alycia.<br /><br />Also, I will probably miss some NBA playoff games, although that's not really that important.<br /><br />Alright, so that's all I have to say about that. 520.275.2551."

That was eight and a half hours ago, which is pretty sad.<br /><br />I'm typing a history paper about Marx and Lenin that I could have done six weeks ago, but decided against doing so on a number different occasions. <br /><br />In the interest of creating as many distractions for myself as possible, I am listening to my iPod on shuffle. This is about the 50th song of the 3615 choices currently available.<br /><br />The name of this song is ""Return of the Mack"" by somebody named Mark Morrison. I have no explanation as to why this song is on my iPod, because I don't particularly enjoy listening to it, and never have. This song must have come out around 1998, because I feel like I heard it on KRQ (the Mojo and Betsy days) about 87,600 times in 6th grade.<br /><br />Yes. It was #39 on the 1997 end of the year chart, reaching as high as #2 the week of May 24, 1997. Sandwiched right between the #1 song, ""Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?"" by someone named Paula Cole, and the #3 song, ""Mmmbop"" by Hanson.<br /><br />1997 was nine years ago, if you can believe that. Arizona had won the national championship two months earlier - we all like to pretend like we have the most vivid memories of that event, but everyone my age was finishing up elementary school. The oldest person who reads this blog likely was barely done with 9th or 10th grade at the oldest. The #1 NBA draft pick was Tim Duncan. Little did we know, the Marlins were just beginning their march to a World Series victory.<br /><br />(Sports are the easiest way for me to get my bearings, at least as far as linear time is concerned. How else are you suppposed to even remotely tell the difference between 1997 and 1998 besides sports or maybe music? No one paid attention to much of anything when they were 11 years old aside from how many Goosebumps or Roald Dahl books they managed to swallow up. Princess Diana died, Mother Theresa died in 1997 - I remember not really understanding why people cared so much; on the other hand, I remember having a considerably easier time accepting the fact that Hanson and the Spice Girls were of terrible importance to many of the kids around me. In my defense, I was 11.)<br /><br /><em> Well, I tried to tell you so (Yes, I did),<br /> But I guess you didn't know,<br /> As the saddest story goes,<br /> Baby, now I got the flow.<br /> 'Cause I knew it from the start,<br /> Baby, when you broke my heart,<br /> That I had to come again,<br /> And show you that I'm with.<br /><br /></em>If this Marx-Lenin paper gets done, there's another one on the Cold War and Imperialism, and then another one on liberalism or nationalism or something. My absolute reluctance to write about these things is interesting, at least to me, because this was the best class I've ever taken.<br /><br />The main thing I learned from the class and the professor is that history is easy to memorize but impossible to fully understand, in part because the world is and has always been impossible. It follows that I would gear myself up to type these papers on all of these big, sweeping ideological concepts and incredible historical texts on World War I and the French Revolution and ask myself ""Wait, what the hell do I have to contribute about this? Why do I even have to pretend that I know what I'm talking about?""<br /><br /><em> You lied to me,<br /> All those times I said that I loved you<br /> You lied to me,<br /> Yes, I tried, yes, I tried,<br /> You lied to me,<br /> Even though you know I'd die for you,<br /> You lied to me,<br /> Yes, I cried, yes, I cried.</em><br /><br />Do you think we'd be better off or worse off if fewer of us were convinced that we are right about everything? I read all of these incredible people, from Rousseau and Kant and Marx Adam Smith and Darwin and Edmund Burke, to Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin and Lenin. All of them believed in these new ideas of monumental proportions about how everything should work, and all of them believed that they were making the world a better place. I guess you just have to take the good with the bad. Or maybe you think we'd be better off shutting the hell up. Both are legitimate positions to take.<br /><br />I have these 2 and a half papers to go, it's the middle of the night, and I have done relatively nothing the entire night. The difference between me and a lot of other people is that I have no idea what's going to happen right now. Most people would just do the papers because that's just what you're supposed to do, which is absolutely the reasonable position to take. I haven't decided when or if, or how many I will finish. Odds are that I will choose to do either 1 or 2, because I tend to do things halfway and then quit.<br /><br />I have very little control over the light switch, as stupid as that sounds.<br /><br />I am getting on a plane in 29 hours whether these papers are done or not. I can take comfort in the reality of the situation, which is that it won't matter whether I do them or not in the long run. It's the difference between in the worst case scenario a B and a C in the class, which would bring my semester GPA down about 0.15 points.<br /><br /><em> Return of the Mack,<br /> It is,<br /> Return of the Mack,<br /> Come on,<br /> Return of the Mack,<br /> Oh, my god,<br /> You know that I'll be back<br /> Here I am.</em><br /><br />What the hell is a Mack? Is his name the Mack?<br /><br />One of my favorite things to say is that someone has no common sense, or something makes no sense. It seems like I should start cutting down. Why should I hold every person and every situation to that standard? Almost every phenomenon of any kind that I've ever seen seems utterly prepostorous to me. For example, Return of the Mack reaching within a cowboy bootprint of hitting #1 on the charts. Or 87 zillion people tuning in every night for American Idol. Or the fact that most of us don't floss, even though it only takes 40 seconds a day, so instead we get cavities. Or My Super Sweet Sixteen. Or people who think that if they drive fast enough, they'll get away from the cops. I just don't get it. I don't get much of anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;Am I calling basically everyone an idiot except me? Of course not. 60% of the things I do make no sense; for whatever reason I make my life more u. For example, sitting here. For example, watching the entirety (some 14 hours worth) of the NFL draft this weekend when I don't really even have a favorite team. Or anything I just wrote, either in the Marx paper or this entry.<br /><em><br /> So, I'm back up in the game,<br /> Running things like half my swing,<br /> Lettin' all the people know,<br /> That I'm back to run the show,<br /> 'Cause what they didn't know was wrong,<br /> And all the nasty things you've done,<br /> So, baby, listen carefully,<br /> While I sing my comeback song.</em><br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think it's sad how difficult it has become to really figure something out, outside of learning how to change a tire. I go to a top 50 (barely) university, I've taken 34 credits over two semesters which have covered a number of amazing and diverse subject matter, and I'm exponentially more confused about my life than I was when I got here in August.<br /><br />I'm becoming increasingly drawn to certain things because I think they help alleviate or sympathize with this feeling of, well, not knowing anything about anything. Calvin and Hobbes is about a little kid who is extremely precocious and always seems to have the most insightful opinion, yet he always seems to be at odds with the world around him. Family Guy and The Simpsons are becoming increasingly reliant on random shit to make us laugh, and I think it comes off to me as entertaning rather than completely inane because I react to the non sequitur the same way as I do a lot of things that people say and do: ""Wait, what?"" The Daily Show lampoons the news and makes me feel a little bit better about all of the ridiculous things that are happening, most of which would be very real and very unfunny if it were actually happening to me.<br /><br />And sports are the one thing that are black and white. There is, comparatively, very little to argue about, Duke lacrosse players and Giants outfielders aside. Every day there are games, every day someone wins or loses. Every day there is someone out there doing well. Unlike everything else, it's not difficult to understand or enjoy.<br /><em><br /> Return of the Mack,<br /> Once again,<br /> Return of the Mack,<br /> Top of the world,<br /> Return of the Mack,<br /> Whatch my flow,<br /> You know that I'll be back,<br /> Don't you know.<br /><br /></em>I don't know what Mark Morrison is singing about. There was a girl and she lied to him, but he's the Mack and he's returning - to do something.<br /><br />I have no conclusion. If I did, that would imply that there was a purpose to this, and that would be false. It's 5 now, and I'm sitting in the same place, staring down the same barrel of the same gun that isn't really a gun at all.<br /><br /><img width=""500"" height=""375"" src=""http://homepages.findlay.edu/dfuller/Images/Computer_Lab_(BCHS).JPG"" alt="""" /><br /><br />But the lab is still lit up like Christmas morning, and I am one of many still in here wasting my time. Some people might be studying, but most people are playing Everquest or poker, and right now, at least I'm reassured that someone is doing something definitively more useless than I am.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><font size=""3"" face=""times"" color=""#000000""></font>"

"event","So.<br /><br />I have noticed that I haven't updated in a very, very long time. If you're reading this, it's because you compulsively check the blogs of everyone you even remotely know.<br /><br />Right now it's 9 in the morning. I'm trying to finish a very long and very phony&nbsp;assignment. Later today I have to write my last english paper, and study for a statistics test on Friday. This weekend I have a few history papers to write, and I have to study for my final in political ideology.<br /><br />I'm not too excited about doing any of that, particularly because I stayed up all night and I am very tired.<br /><br />Rest assured, though, the hits will begin to come again. Over the last 3-4 weeks I had four or five good ideas and they are all saved on my computer, all of them somewhere between 50-75% complete. As soon as I get home I'm looking forward to digging them up and turning them into something. I can tell that it's getting close to time because last week I decided to start picking fights with people over <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~bmasters/duke.html"">random&nbsp;nonsense</a>&nbsp;and I felt good about that.<br /><br />I have not left this site for dead. There are some exciting things coming up, and a lot of things have already happened that I have completely neglected to mention but are worth writing about.<br /><br />Under most circumstances, I really enjoy posting to this site. It is usually the only way I can figure anything out in my life. Unfortunately, right now I have to finish my freshman year in college. At this point I am cursing myself for not enrolling at Chaparral, or ITT Tech. But we all have to make choices, and so here I am.<br /><br />At least I have the NFL Draft this weekend, and then home, to look forward to. If you want to play golf with me anytime soon, please let me know, and we will go.<br /><br />Until then, enjoy the flamboyance of the <a href=""http://www.personal.psu.edu/dmc370/eportfolio/"">terrible personal&nbsp;website</a> I had to make for English 30. How embarrassing. These are the things I have to do to get good grades.&nbsp;God knows what the hell is going on around here.<br /><br />"

"event","I'm going to give you two players, Player A and Player B, and we'll do a little comparison.<br /><br />Player A is a 6'3, 197 pound shooting guard. In his four years in college, he averaged 14.5 points a game on 45.1% field goal shooting. He was 342/802 from three point line, at an outstanding 42.6% clip. He also averaged 2.9 rebounds per game and 1.9 assists per game, while only playing a suprising 28.8 minutes a game.&nbsp;<br /><br />Player B is a 6'4, 190 pound shooting guard. In his four years in college, he averaged 19.9 points a game on 43.2% field goal shooting. He was 457/1126 from long range over the course of his career, which is a 40.6% 3 point percentage. He also averaged 2.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game, while playing 36.6 minutes per game.<br /><br />The scouting report on player A:<br />""He is a great shooter. Not a good shooter, but a great shooter.&nbsp;He can hit the standstill jumper or coming off screens, and he does a nice job of hitting the runner when he can get by his man. If you foul him, he hits his free throws. Ready for the knocks on him? He has great difficulty moving his feet. He struggles to get his own shot. He cannot stay in front of any reputable NBA guard on the defensive end. In short,&nbsp;he is as slow as molasses in January. He will be an NBA player because he has a needed skill that is absent from the NBA -- he can really shoot the ball.""<br /><br />The scouting report on player B:<br />""One of the two or three best pure shooters in the country. His shooting mechanics are flawless, and he possesses very deep range on his jumper. Has a quick release that lets him get his shot off in most situations. He's also a dead-eye from the free-throw line. Has diversified his offensive game a bit this season and is now putting the ball on the floor and getting to the rim. Despite a general lack of athleticism, he's not a bad defender. He's undersized to play the two in the NBA. Combine that with a lack of of lateral quickness, and scouts aren't sure exactly how his game will translate at the next level. Even though he seems to have diversified his game greatly, scouts seriously wonder if he'll be able to get to the rim and create his own shot off the dribble at the next level.""<br /><br />Player A was the second leading scorer on his team his junior and senior years, and was MVP of the East Regional in the NCAA tournament his senior year. His team fell in the National Championship game, but he had 25 points in a losing effort. He missed a two potential game winning shots in the last minute of the final, but after the game his coach said of him, ""I want&nbsp;[him] to take that shot. I will win or lose with [him]. I will walk down any road with [him]...The ball was in our best player's hands with an opportunity to win the game.""<br /><br />Player B also went to the final four, in his sophomore year. His team lost in the national semifinal, though he was 4-12 for 15 points in the game. In four NCAA tournament losses, he was 13-60 (22 percent). He didn't take the last shot.<br /><br />Player A played with terrific players like Elton Brand, Shane Battier, Mike Dunleavy and Corey Magette. Player B also had some talent surrounding him, like Luol Deng, Shelden Williams, Shavlik Randolph, Chris Duhon and Dahntay Jones.<br /><br />Player A is Trajan Langdon, the ""Alaskan Assassin."" He played at Duke and was drafted 12th by Cleveland, just behind Shawn Marion and Jason Terry, ahead of current NBA stars Corey Magette, Andrei Kirilenko and Ron Artest,&nbsp;and also&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;solid league contributors like&nbsp;James Posey, Kenny Thomas and Devean George.<br /><br />Trajan Langdon's NBA career:<br /><br />3 seasons, 119 games, 14.5 minutes, 5.4 points a game, 39% 3 point shooting. Out of the league in 2002. Played in Italy for Bennetton Treviso in 2002-2003, then went to Turkey for a year, and is currently playing in Russia.<br /><br />Player B is J.J. Redick. J.J. Redick is Trajan Langdon, except he's white and he got to shoot more. He's&nbsp;not Jeff Hornacek. Jeff Hornacek shot 47% for his career, and 49% in college. In addition, Hornacek wasn't such a defensive liability, and he was an outstanding passer, and he also played in an era where every shooting guard wasn't 6'5 or taller. Hornacek never had to shoot&nbsp;every night over tall, athletic guys like&nbsp;Kobe, Wade, T-Mac, Ray Allen, Vince Carter, Jason Richardson, Rip Hamilton, Manu, Michael Redd, or Bruce Bowen or Trenton Hassell.<br /><br />Would I take Redick if I'm an NBA GM? Sure, if he's still available in the second round. Give me Brandon Roy, or Randy Foye, or Mardy Collins, or Ronnie Brewer, or Maurice Ager. Hell, I'll take Hassan Adams, Mike Gansey, or Quincy Douby. I'm not gonna be the guy who takes Trajan Langdon, or&nbsp;the shorter version of&nbsp;Kyle Korver.<br /><br /><img height=""235"" width=""146"" alt="""" src=""http://espn.go.com/media/photo/1999/march/03/s_trajan.jpg"" />&nbsp;<font size=""5"">= </font><img style=""WIDTH: 183px; HEIGHT: 231px"" height=""263"" width=""210"" alt="""" src=""http://us.news3.yimg.com/us.i2.yimg.com/p/rids/20060324/i/r2062660510.jpg?x=358&amp;y=345&amp;sig=S7.xkteckFhAuR8jJDuKIw--"" />&nbsp;= <img style=""WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 230px"" height=""274"" width=""248"" alt="""" src=""http://us.news3.yimg.com/us.i2.yimg.com/p/rids/20060318/i/r673516797.jpg?x=329&amp;y=345&amp;sig=nGnkUE37Noyms6k9PxTljA--"" /><br /><br />"

"event","<strong>Round 2 </strong><br /><br />My last entry was 4200 words, so let's cut to the chase.<br /><br />To make this go faster, we'll assume you picked all the top 4 seeds to advance to the second round. Can one of those 16 teams lose? Of course - look at Vermont and Bucknell last year. But I don't have the time to give you guidance on what to do with Davidson or Xavier in the second round. If you're going to pick a massive upset, you are a renegade and you don't need my help.<br /><br />Here's a rule of thumb: if you're not sure who you like in a first round game, you obviously shouldn't take the winner of what you percieve to be a coin flip in the second round. Say you are faced with a tough 7-10 matchup and you're torn. Why the hell would you pick them to go on past the 2 in the second round? You're looking at a 50% chance of winning in the first, then maybe a 40% shot at best in the second. That's a 1 in 5 shot, which is a pretty dumb overall choice over the 3 seed (90%, then 60%, which is 54% of going through). Much better, wouldn't you say? The point is, if you want to pick a Cinderella, you better be pretty damn sold on them.<br /><font size=""3""><strong><br />Atlanta Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Duke vs. George Washington/UNC Wilmington<br /><br />I established last time that while I don't think GW deserved to get such a low seed, I don't think they're that good, and I definitely don't think they're good enough to beat Duke if they beat UNCW. The x-factor: while Duke is playing in Greensboro, everyone else in North Carolina HATES Duke, and all neutral fans will be pulling hard for the 8/9 winner in this game. Do I think this will be a close game? Yes, if Duke plays UNCW. I'm not so sure about GW. Either way, neither team has done enough to convince me to go against the Blue Devils, as much as I'm tempted to do so. They have too many doofuses who can step up and throw in 12-14 points if Redick or Williams struggles.<br /><br />4) LSU vs. Syracuse/Texas A&amp;M<br /><br />This is exactly what I'm talking about. Syracuse has been on a magical run, but they could be out of gas. Texas A&amp;M beat Texas and blew out Colorado, but they're inexperienced and they weren't even considered a tournament until late in the year. LSU clearly seems to be the stronger of the three, but they have weaknesses with ball handling and turnovers; they've also been absolutely miserable in their last two NCAA appearences. Something's gotta give. A lot of people are going with Syracuse. I'm not.<br /><br />3) Iowa vs. West Virginia/Southern Illinois<br /><br />Ouch. You know, you just know, that as soon as you pencil in West Virginia, they'll put up 5-29 from three land in the first round, lose, then Iowa will take down SIU and you're sitting there having lost another game to the field which includes your Grandma and everyone else who penciled in Iowa because they were the higher seed. This game and this bracket all depends on just how much you like West Virginia. It's completely hit or miss.<br /><br />2) Texas vs. California/NC State<br /><br />There's no question I'm picking Texas here. The question is rereading what I wrote last night about the Cal/NC State game and second guessing myself. I penciled in Cal because I think they have the best player, but there are two things I'm concerned with: one, I picked all four 7 seeds. When the hell does that happen? Second, goddamn NC State is one of those teams who I screw up just like Alabama. They screwed me last year big time, but I'm sticking with my guns, and if NC State knocks off Texas, I'm going to throw a microwave through my window.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Oakland Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Memphis vs. Arkansas/Bucknell<br /><br />Memphis is the weakest #1, so there might be some temptation to go sentimental and pick Bucknell. I don't think that would be a wise idea. Remember when St. Joes went 29-1 or something in the regular season (04) and everyone was picking them to go down to Bob Knight and Tech in round 2, then Wake Forest in the sweet 16? They ended up losing to Oklahoma State in the Elite 8. This Memphis team is more talented, although less experienced. Regardless, I think they'll go farther than most people are projecting.<br /><br />4) Kansas vs. Pittsburgh/Kent State<br /><br />Again, Kent State doesn't come off as a Cinderella as much as they do a team who should have been a 13 or 14. Kansas/Pitt should be a competitive (but ugly) game. Pitt has the senior leadership in Krauser, but Kansas has much more overall talent (Wright, Rush, Chalmers, Kaun). Still, if the scoring stays in the 50's or 60's, Pitt will have the edge. Kansas isn't a great half-court team.<br /><br />3)Gonzaga vs. Indiana/San Diego State<br /><br />No matter who wins between Indy and the Aztecs, the game against Gonzaga will be an absolute shootout. All three are explosive offensive teams, and Gonzaga/Indiana could be a game to remember. Indiana wouldn't be a bad pick, especially considering the Zags have flamed out in the second round the last two years; the only thing I'm concerned about the Hoosiers is that they're playing in Salt Lake, so the altitude could affect Killingsworth, who has definitely had his fill of Chili Cheese Fritos over the years and will definitely be huffing and puffing down the court. They don't have anyone else down low except him, so if he gets winded Batista will have a field day.<br /><br />2)UCLA vs. Marquette/Alabama<br /><br />Marquette is real good, and they've been there. Novak was a freshman when they went to the final four with Wade and Diener. UCLA, on the other hand, hasn't been there, and they won the Pac-10 in what was a down year for the conference. They've beaten Nevada and Michigan, but also lost to Memphis, and West Virginia at home. It's just hard to tell whether this is a team who is ready for the big time. Alabama's been there as well, and again, I'm picking against them, and again, they might screw me, just like NC State. UCLA is in San Diego, basically playing a home game, so they're probably the safe pick. The truth about this half of the bracket is that Gonzaga has a great shot to get back to the Elite 8, especially if Larry Bird shows up for them.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Washington DC Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Connecticut vs. Kentucky/UAB<br /><br />Please, everyone pick against UConn. Please. Say they don't play hard, say they've lost some games they should have won, say they don't have the heart to win it all. I'm begging you to pick against Williams and Brown and Anderson and Gay and Armstrong and Boone. Do it.<br /><br />4) Illinois vs. Washington/Utah State<br /><br />Illinois is vulnerable here to either team; Washington could outscore them, or Utah State could shut down the threes and win it in a low scoring game. Again, though, if you're not sure who's going to win the first game, it's statistically really dumb to pick them twice. Then again, nothing about this is really an exact science, but I'm just saying.<br /><br />3) UNC vs. Michigan State/George Mason<br /><br />UNC-Michigan State is really intriguing. Can the Spartans make another Final Four run as a lower seed (they were a 5 seed last year when they knocked off Duke and Kentucky)? They have the core back in Davis, Ager and Brown, but they no longer have those experienced role players, Hill, Anderson, Torbert. Trannon is a question mark with his jaw. UNC shouldn't be a 3, they're good enough to be a 4 or 5, but they're still a solid, young, squad. I think Paul Davis might make another tournament run. If he does, UNC needs to watch out, because he can definitely play with Hansbrough when his head is in the game.<br /><br />2) Tennessee vs. Wichita State/Seton Hall<br /><br />Does the ESPN all-access coverage of Tennessee's preparation jinx them or does it mean they'll shut everyone up and go to the Sweet 16? If Marquette or Georgetown was in this spot, I'm taking them without a doubt. I think Seton Hall sucks, and Wichita State is great on paper....but they're still Wichita State. This is an ""ugh"" game. You look at it and you can't see anyone winning, even though someone has to. Yikes.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Minneapolis Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Villanova vs. Arizona/Wisconsin<br /><br />Um, yeah. Villanova here. If Arizona beats Villanova, good for them. A bunch of 14 year old freshmen boys at Catalina Foothills High School and your red-sweater-wearing great-aunt Peggy will have the lead in your tournament pool after the first weekend. Am I rooting for Arizona? Of course, particularly because I'm not picking Villanova to go to the Final Four.<br /><br />4) Boston College vs. Nevada/Montana<br /><br />One anecdote about Boston College that should give you pause:<br /><br />Boston College, with All-American guard Troy Bell, is a 3 seed after a great 2000-2001 season (the year Arizona lost to Duke in the final). They're matched up in the 2nd round against 6 seed USC. Down 74-71, BC has the ball with 5 or 6 seconds to go. What do they do? Does Bell get the ball and put up a game tying three? Does he penetrate and kick it out to the open man? No. Someone names Kenny Harley gets the ball, <em>drives to the basket,</em> and misses a layup to end the game.<br /><br /><em>The guy either didn't know or didn't know that they were down by 3. </em>How does a coach not let all of his players know? How does he let that happen? How does Al Skinner sleep at night?<br /><br />Al Skinner is still the head coach at Boston College, and as long as he is, I feel nervous about picking the Eagles to win any game, much less a game against Nevada in the NCAA Tournament. Still, I almost feel obligated to. You can make your own decision.<br /><br />3) Florida vs. Oklahoma/Wisconsin-Milwaukee<br /><br />Not sold on Florida. Either of these teams are good enough to beat them. Billy Donavan is an idiot in the tournament for some reason, and this team does not have Haslem or Mike Miller. Joakim Noah is too goofy looking for me to take him that seriously. Still, I'll probably end up going with them to get at least this far, because the other one is in question. Remember, UWM can play.<br /><br />2) Ohio State vs. Georgetown/Northern Iowa<br /><br />If the Bucks play G'Town, it should be a good game. If they play UNI, it probably won't be. I realize that Georgetown beat Duke, but they've been inconsistent and Ohio State just has too many weapons. If you've never heard of a young man named Jamar Butler, you will after this tournament. Ohio State is loaded this year, and when Oden and Conley get there next year, you might as well give them a bye into the 07 Final Four.<br /><br />More tomorrow.<br />"

In fact, when I look at the bracket I realize I've seen nearly every team seeded higher than 12 play at least once this season.<br /><br />On that note, I was having this conversation an hour ago:<br /><br />Seahawk88:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are you going to fill out a bracket<br />dream4xoxo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no<br />Seahawk88:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why not<br />Seahawk88:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can do it through facebook<br />dream4xoxo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because it would be wrong and u would laugh at me<br /><br />I immediately thought to myself, what better way to spend the better part of today than by ignoring any homework or studying and instead writing a billion pages about the tournament, one game at a time? <br /><br />(If you want to participate here are some places to go:)<br /><br /><a href=""http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/frontpage"">http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/frontpage</a><br /><a href=""http://facebook.com/tourney.php"">http://facebook.com/tourney.php</a><br /><a href=""http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/men"">http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/men</a><br /><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Atlanta Regional</font></strong><br /><br />1) Duke vs. 16) Southern<br /><br />Let's be clear about one thing: I hate Duke. Their team, their coach, their fans can all eat it. With that being said, they're not going to lose to Southern, not in Greensboro or any place else. Southern had a good year, dominating the good old SWAC. Here's hoping they can slow the game down, stay competitive for a half and keep the margin of victory to less than 20, like Delaware State did much to my delight last year against Duke (57-46). Shutting down Redick would be great as well.<br /><br />8) George Washington vs. 9) UNC-Wilmington<br /><br />I feel bad, but not that bad for GW - a 26-2 team getting an 8 seed, in part because their best player (Pops Mensa-Bonsu) is hurt and their non-conference schedule was embarrassingly easy. (There's nothing honorable about beating the hell out of Morgan State and Kennesaw at home.) In addition, they have to play UNCW in North Carolina, who is no slouch (15-3 in the CAA, beat USC in 2002, nearly took out Maryland in 03). The bottom line is that GW has a bunch of athletes who will run you off the court if you turn it over or don't play transition defense. Wilmington doesn't turn it over and they play outstanding defense. With or without Pops, GW is shaky, so this is a game you can pick up on the rest of the country (who is picking GW 75% of the time thus far) if you go with the Seahawks. The bottom line is that GW doesn't really impress me.<br /><br />4) LSU vs. 13) Iona<br /><br />The good news about this matchup is that LSU is a very good team, good enough to beat Syracuse, even good enough to beat Duke. The bad news is that there's no doubt in my mind that Iona could beat them if they play well. Iona's guards, Burtt and Toliver, are averaging 41 points a game combined, and with scoring like that out of your backcourt you're going to be able to play against anyone, which they have done against Iowa State and Kentucky. LSU has one of the best frontcourts in the country, as well as a great point guard in Darel Mitchell. The problem is that Tyrus Thomas has been hurt and they don't know what they're going to get from him. If Big Baby Davis gets in foul trouble or eats a few too many onion rings before the game, anything could happen. In spite of that, their height and talent advantage up front is too much to pick against LSU in the first round with any confidence.<br /><br />5) Syracuse vs. 12) Texas A&amp;M<br /><br />Syracuse is a great story, but a 5 seed is an absolute joke. You don't go from out of the tournament to a 5 seed just because you won 4 games in a row. Sure it was impressive, but these guys are a 6-7 seed at best. Apparently the regular season doesn't count for anything anymore, since they're seeded ahead of West Virginia, Marquette, Georgetown and the same as Pittsburgh despite finishing 7-9 in the Big East. I'm not on the committee though, so here we are, two teams who played their way into the tournament very late matched up in the first round. Syracuse has better players, but are they out of gas from winning 4 in 4 this weekend? This is the same team minus Hakim Warrick who flamed out against Vermont last year, and Texas A&amp;M has the inside/outside working with Jones and Law. Nonetheless, you don't bet against a team on such an unbelievable roll, and if it gets tight late in the game you're probably going to be glad you picked Syracuse, especially when you see McNamara out there making a ridiculous shot to win or tie.<br /><br />6) West Virginia vs. 11) Southern Illinois<br /><br />The case for West Virginia is clear when you look at a) last year and b) the wins in the regular season this year: are you kidding me? at Oklahoma, at Villanova, at UCLA, and at Georgetown? This is a very, very good team with a very, very good player (Gansey), and they can obviously beat anyone anywhere (they also almost knocked off UConn and Texas at Texas). They are much better than a 6 seed. On the other hand, the case against them is that they are a sexy pick - maybe too sexy. Every year someone picks one of these 6 or 7 seeds to make a deep run and they get knocked off in the first round and one eighth of your bracket is screwed on the first day. I think back to when Gonzaga was opposite us in 02 and bitching about getting a 6 seed, and Wyoming sent them packing before they even got a chance to play us. It doesn't help matters that Southern Illinois has had recent success in the tournament (sweet 16 in 02). In the end, though, West Virginia is better and they should win - but if you go with SIU, you might find yourself in the lead on Friday night should some weird shit go down.<br /><br />3) Iowa vs. 14) Northwestern St.<br /><br />Northwestern State is good. Shame they didn't get one of those precious 12 seeds, then I'd be more inclined to pick them against Syracuse or Washington. The potential for an upset is always there, because Iowa can be awful offensively at times, but I don't think they'll be able to get it done. Then again, these are the types of games where if Northwestern State is hanging tough, you bitch yourself out silently for not believing in them enough to pick them. Odds are Iowa will clamp down early and win by about a dozen.<br /><br />7) Cal vs. 10) NC State<br /><br />Hey NC State, have fun against Leon Powe. Only way the Pack have a chance: Powe foul trouble, Powe has a terrible game, or the guards (Midgley and Ubaka) totally let him down. Then again, last year I picked Charlotte, who had Withers and Basden, to beat NC State, and NC State goes and beats them and UConn. But that team had Julius Hodge, and this team most certainly does not. <br /><br />2)Texas vs. 15) Penn<br /><br />The 15 seed in this bracket is Penn, not Penn State. Penn is the best Ivy, but they don't have much behind Ibby Jaaber. Texas by a lot. I would know more about Penn's team, but a certain Penn student whom I happen to be dating decided not to go to any of their games because she ""didn't want to go alone"". You can blame her for my lack of knowledge of Penn basketball. I do know that Texas has LaMarcus Aldridge and Penn doesn't.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Oakland Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Memphis vs. 16) Oral Roberts<br /><br />Heh. Oral Roberts. I know nobody likes Memphis as a 1 seed, but this is not where you pick them to go down. The 2nd round matchup doesn't scare me too much either, but this isn't where we talk about the 2nd round. Oral Roberts had tough losses to Marquette by 3 and at Utah State by 1, but there's a reason why they're a 16 seed.<br /><br />8) Arkansas vs. 9) Bucknell<br /><br />Damn these 8-9 games. You might as well just flip a coin. Bucknell deserves to be this high; no one can forget the win over Kansas last year, and they've followed it up with wins over Syracuse and DePaul, as well as an undefeated season in the Patriot League. The X factor in this game is Ronnie Brewer. If he shows up, he can carry them. If he doesn't take control right away, Bucknell is going to have the crowd on their side (even in Dallas), and they'll win. This is one of those where if you don't take Bucknell, you'll feel like an idiot if they win because everyone else and their grandmother did.<br /><br />5) Pittsburgh vs. 12) Kent State<br /><br />Kent State went to the Elite 8 in 2002 I believe. They even beat Pittsburgh in the sweet 16. The difference this year is that there is no Trevor Huffman or Antonio Gates putting up 22 and 8 boards. He's a little bit busy going to the Pro Bowl, catching touchdowns, etc. Kent State better hope that Pittsburgh fires up a 22% from the field in the first half to have a chance.<br /><br />4) Kansas vs. 13) Bradley<br /><br />Normally I would say watch out for this game, because Arizona beat Kansas, so how good could they be? They answered that on Sunday when they pounded Texas: quite good indeed. Bradley has a big guy, they're a hot team, but they looked bad against Southern Illinois, and that ain't gonna get it done.<br /><br />6) Indiana vs. 11) San Diego State<br /><br />San Diego State isn't that bad of a team, they've got some crazy shooting guy in Brandon Heath (7-27 in the MWC final against Wyoming) and two bigs in Slaughter and Abukar. The game is in Salt Lake, so there's that. Most people will go with Indiana, because they're better. Killingsworth can be dominant and Vaden (if he's healthy) and Strickland can really play. The question is, if they get behind or Killingsworth gets into foul trouble, will they curl up and die or will they fight back for Coach Davis? I'll take Indiana, because Indiana-Gonzaga will be an absolutely fantastic game in round 2.<br /><br />3) Gonzaga vs. 14) Xavier<br /><br />Please, Gonzaga. Please. Play some defense. Don't screw around. There is no David West on Xavier, there is no Brian Grant, no James Posey, no Tyrone Hill. Take care of business and bury this team, who was handed the bid to this tournament on a silver platter by GW, Temple, Charlotte and St. Joes. Their best player is hurt, their point guard got kicked off the team. Don't ruin everyone's bracket by playing like idiots and making Morrisson score 47 every game. Batista is a good player and Raivio and Knight need to stop standing around and waiting for the other guys to bail them out. Gonzaga was lucky to win the WCC tourney and that should be scary. Then again, maybe Morrisson really is Larry Bird.<br /><br />7) Marquette vs. 10) Alabama<br /><br />Tough, tough game. Steve Novak is ridiculous for Marquette, and those freshman guards are pretty damn impressive. At the same time, I feel like Alabama has burned me the last 5 years, either losing to Wisconsin-Milwaukee or beating Stanford or something stupid like that. This would normally be a game I'd outsmart myself and pick Alabama because they're struggling and everyone is expecting Marquette to walk. Not this year. Dwyane Wade will put on a jersey and Marquette should be able to get it done. Novak is just plain frightening; he's a skinny 6'10 white guy who bombs NBA threes and anyone who puts up 41 and 16 against UConn, I'm not going to pick against you, even if you're a skinny 6'10 white guy.<br /><br />2) UCLA vs. 15) Belmont<br /><br />UCLA is going to win this game, but you gotta love Belmont. There's a <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/tourney06/2006-03-12-belmont-cover_x.htm"">great article on them in USA Today,</a>&nbsp; You probably won't watch except for the score in the top left corner, but just remember these kids on Belmont are going to playing their hearts out, so root them on against UCLA, because who likes UCLA anyway?<br /><br />Halfway done. This is not a copy and paste job from an Andy Katz article; I take full responsibility for the length and the originality of ideas.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Minneapolis Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Uconn vs. 16) Albany<br /><br />Poor Albany. You guys had a good season, but after this one you'll have wished you were playing Northeastern in the NIT. Albany over UConn would be the biggest upset in sports history. I don't understand how UConn has lost any game this year with the players they have. That statement obviously foreshadows who I think is the favorite to win it all.<br /><br />8) Kentucky vs. 9) UAB<br /><br />Interesting rematch from 2003, when UAB knocked out then-#1 seed Kentucky in the 2nd round. Both teams were much better last time. UAB no longer has the Taylor twins, and Demario Eddins is out for the year. Johnson and McDonald are terrific in the backcourt, but I feel like Rondo, Sparks and Moss can play with them and UAB doesn't have an answer for Morris inside. 5 minutes into the game, you'll be able to tell from their body language which Kentucky team is going to show up. Neither of these teams gets past round 2, but it's going to be an awesome conclusion to the first round on Friday night. UAB is always fun to watch because of their full court press.<br /><br />5) Washington vs. 12) Utah State<br /><br />A 5 seed usually always goes down in the first round. It could very well be Washington this year. I'm sorry, I can't pick you to go deep in the tournament if you lose to Washington State twice. I don't think Utah State deserves to be here over Cincinnati or Hofstra, but all three of those teams would have an excellent shot at Washington. Is Roy, the Pac-10 POY over Powe somehow, going to live up to his title? USU led the Frye-Stoudamire-3 minutes away from Final Four AZ team at half in the first round last year, and they were an open layup away from beating Nevada on the road twice this season. Put it this way: if you took them, you wouldn't be an idiot in my book.<br /><br />4) Illinois vs. 13) Air Force<br /><br />Stuart Mandel from CNNSI.com: ""Someone on the selection committee must have a 17-year-old son who wants to get into the Air Force Academy."" Me last night: ""I think the Air Force threatened to bomb someone or something."" Cincinnati would dominate Air Force. Yes, I'm bitter about Cincinnati. How do you leave those guys out? Eric Hicks, James White? Unacceptable, NCAA Selection Committee. Do I have an irrational love of Cincinnati basketball? Yes. Is Illinois going to take Air Force apart? No, because brackets hate me and love to get me back for saying stuff like this.<br /><br />6) Michigan State vs. 11) George Mason<br /><br />Hofstra got hit in the groin both literally and figuratively by George Mason, and the Mo Ager and Shannon Brown show will exact vengance on the Patriots for stealing Hofstra's spot. No thanks, George Mason. We don't like dirty players. You gave us great memories in 2001, when a 30-year-old soldier almost led you to an upset over Maryland, but this year I'll pass.<br /><br />3) North Carolina vs. 14) Murray State<br /><br />As much as I would love for this upset to happen, I just don't think it's in the cards. Hansbrough is an absolute force. UNC and Michigan State, that's going to be another terrific second-round game if it turns out that way, even though BC should be a 3 and UNC should be a 4. Noel and Terry have been playing good ball as well, so if Hansbrough gets the jitters they should be able to take over and lead them past Murray State.<br /><br />7) Wichita State vs. 10) Seton Hall<br /><br />By far the most vulnerable top seed in the tournament (Tennessee) probably awaits the winner of this. Seton Hall is a very unattractive team. You lose to Duke by 53, you lose to Richmond, Northwestern, Rutgers twice, DePaul, and St. John's? Once again, this is Cincinnati's spot. Wichita is a balanced, underrated team with a nice front court and discipline on both sides of the ball. Remember the name Paul Miller - if these guys make their run, it'll be because he's established himself inside against Seton Hall and/or Tennessee. The way Seton Hall wins this is if Wichita State gets nervous under the lights, throws the ball away, and a more athletic Seton Hall team makes a lot of fast break buckets.<br /><br />2) Tennessee vs. 15) Winthrop<br /><br />People, do not let the seeds scare you away from this one. Tennessee's coach, along with everyone else, doesn't think his team should be a 2, and Winthrop definitely doesn't think they should be a 15. Tennessee presses a lot and Lofton is a great player, but they're small and Winthrop shouldn't be terribly bothered by the full court pressure. Bradshaw is a solid player underneath for Winthrop and Shuler and Martin are experienced, solid players who can shoot the 3. The game is in Greensboro, and Winthrop will have all the neutral fans on their side in addition to a sold out cheering section (Winthrop is in Rock Hill, SC). Tennesse comes into the game having lost 4 of their last 6 and they don't play great defense. Am I going to take Winthrop? I don't know yet. But it's worth considering. I think Tennessee has their hands full, and if they survive the Eagles, Wichita State is good enough to finish them off.<br /><br />Home stretch....<br /><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Atlanta Region</strong></font><br /><br />1) Villanova vs. 16) Monmouth/Hampton winner<br /><br />I have to say, I'm a little ticked off at Hampton. I was looking forward to seeing my boys from Delaware State again, and I thought for sure it was going to happen when they dominated the MEAC regular season. I know I'm repeating myself, but they played one of the most fun games I've ever watched last year, when they <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48444-2005Mar18.html"">went up against Duke</a>. The DSU coach, who had small guards and fairly athletic forwards, would run a four corners offense where one of their forwards would get the ball at midcourt with the shot clock below 10 or 15 and simply go one-on-one against Shavlik Randolph or Shelden Williams. They held Redick to 7 points on 1 of 7 shooting. This is a team I wanted to see again, and I'm really kind of upset about that. Now they play NAU in the NIT, which is no consolation to me. The point is that I hate Duke, and Monmouth will beat Hampton but get wiped out by Villanova.<br /><br />8) Arizona vs. 9) Wisconsin<br /><br />I hate to tell everyone this, but it doesn't look good. Wisconsin isn't great, but they're certainly talented enough to beat us. They killed Penn State twice this year; again, not a huge accomplishment, but we are a 6-10 team in the toughest RPI conference, a team who did beat Illinois and Indiana. They can shoot the ball, they have height, and one of those annoying intangible guys (Chappell) along with the best overall player (Tucker). Shakur better come ready to play against Kammron Taylor, otherwise known as Chris Rock. Actually, here's hoping that defensively Lute puts Rodgers on Taylor and Shakur on Nixon. Will Adams be able to contain Tucker, and will Tucker be able to contain Adams? Will Walters be able to guard the guy who gave him his scholarship (Brian Butch)? These are two teams who aren't happy with the way they've played this season, and I'm sure Wisconsin fans are thinking that they are in trouble against Arizona as well. I'm going with Wisconsin, if only because I have a vested interest in the outcome of the game. To me, this game is a coin flip, and 'Nova will take care of either one in round 2; by picking Wisconsin, I win either way.<br /><br />5) Nevada vs. 12) Montana<br /><br />Nevada is an excellent team with a number of weapons. Nick Fazekas would easily be all-first team Pac-10 if not player of the year, and with Charlo and Kemp they have a number of options on both sides of the ball. Montana looked impressive against NAU, but not impressive enough to convince me that they will beat Nevada. The potential second-round matchup against an underseeded BC team has all the makings of a showdown you'd normally see in the Sweet 16 or Elite 8. Both teams I believe are among the best 16 in the country, and it's unfortunate that one has to go home so soon. Nevada is riding a long winning streak, and this is a team who beat Texas (sans Tucker and Aldridge) in the first round last year.<br /><br />4) Boston College vs. 13) Pacific<br /><br />This is another game that could absolutely ruin people early on. A bunch of ESPN guys have BC going to the Final Four. I think that's a dicey pick. I don't see BC beating Nevada, Villanova, and either Ohio State or Florida to get there. That's simply too much to ask. Furthermore, they need to make sure they don't watch too much SportsCenter and forget about Pacific, who's beaten Providence and Pittsburgh the last two years in the first round. They still have Johnny Gray and Christian Maraker, so if Smith and Dudley fall asleep at the wheel, Pacific won't be afraid to give them all they can handle. Be prepared to laugh if BC goes down and people's brackets' are ruined 3 hours into Thursday play. This is the same BC team who was a 4 last year and went down to an underdog team we're about to talk about (UWM) in the second round.<br /><br />6) Oklahoma vs. 11) Wisconsin-Milwaukee<br /><br />Overrated big-name higher seed from a power conference? Check. Experienced underdog who has made a splash before? Check. Neutral site (Jacksonville)? Check. Prove me wrong, Taj Gray and Terrell Everett. Don't pull an Alabama and sleepwalk your way into an insurmountable hole against these guys. Joah Tucker was ridiculously good last year. They also have Boo Davis and the big guy Tigert anchoring the middle. This is yet another early game that might screw people one way or the other. Don't feel bad if you turn on the TV after the first slot of games on Thursday and you're 0-4.<br /><br />3) Florida vs. 14) South Alabama<br /><br />Florida should win this game, but South Alabama absolutely destroyed a solid Western Kentucky team in the Sun Belt final. I don't know much about them, but Florida has fallen to Creighton and Manhattan as a 5 seed with more talent than they have now. If Florida is awake they should destroy USA on the boards. Does South Alabama bring back any memories? That's the team who was leading Arizona by 10 with 8 minutes to go as a 13 seed in first round of the 1997 tournament. UA went on a 22-4 to end the game and started the run that ended in a national title.<br /><br />7) Georgetown vs. 10) Northern Iowa<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that Georgetown is better than Northern Iowa, so you have to pick them. If you pick the lesser team and they lose, you can only blame yourself. Georgetown has great size with Hibbert and heady forwards in Green and Bowman. UNI got in only because they beat Missouri State in the MVC tournament; they were lucky to get by Bucknell in double OT at home. How Bradley is a 13 and UNI is a 10 is questionable when you consider that Bradley blew out UNI late in the season during their winning streak that carried them to the MVC tourney title game. Yes, the Panthers beat Iowa and beat LSU on the road, but that was early in the season. Do they have a shot? Absolutely. But the way they're playing, I'd be very surprised if they upset Georgetown.<br /><br />2) Ohio State vs. 15) Davidson<br /><br />I love Ohio State. I love Dials inside, Sylvester's clutch shooting, Foster and Butler in the backcourt, and I really really like J.J. Sullinger as an all-around player. I think before you look at BC coming out of this bracket, you have to look at Ohio State first. Big Ten regular season champs, talent everywhere. They hit a bump in the title game against Iowa, but they won't see a defensive team like them anywhere in this bracket. If they're hitting their threes, no one is going to beat them, and even if they're not, Davidson doesn't stand a chance.<br /><br />So there you go. I'm not listing who I'm picking, one because I haven't decided on all of them yet, and two because you just don't do that before the tournament starts. Tomorrow we'll go over potential second, third and fourth round matchups. I hope some of this proves to be useful.<br /><br />I can't tell you how glad I am to be back on the horse."

"event","Let me tell you people something.

I am by nature an unhappy person.

Everything is going great in my life right now and I am still unhappy.

I have interesting classes where we read and talk about a lot of unbelievably fascinating and profound ideas.

I am going to the 48th best university in the country for free even though I did no homework in high school. I'm basically cheating some poor hardworking kid out of the scholarship he could have landed.

We have a 10-1 football team and a basketball team who plays with heart. I have season tickets. I am allowed to go on ESPN.com as many times as I want per day. We have free internet.

I go to class for 3 hours a day. The rest of the time I have to do whatever I want.

Mostly everyone whom I definitely dislike in the world is thousands of kilometres away from me.

I am in good health. My dorm is a 1 minute walk from a massive rec facility where I could do whatever I want if I chose. 

I have a card that pays for all of my meals.

I have way too much money for someone who hasn't worked for shit since he was 15.

I am smarter than everyone else so I don't have to study for anything. I can get at worst a C and at best a 100 on whatever I do.

I write terrible papers in english class about golf and the teacher gives it an A when the average grade is a C-.

People used to like my blog back when I wrote in it.

No one cares if I want to sit in my room all day and listen to Shakira and watch West Wing DVD's. I don't listen to Shakira.

The only thing I've been hurt by in the last year is my lower back.

I am in a relationship with a girl who is nice. One tends to be surprised once he ventures out into the great unknown and realizes that there are a lot of mean, crazy people out there. I am in a relationship with a girl who is nice to me back even when I am being myself (an asshole) to her. And she goes to an Ivy League school, but she's not a huge dork or anything. A rare breed of woman, my friends.

I can drink as much Wild Cherry Pepsi as I want, even though I gotta tell you it's getting pretty goddamn disgusting.

I'm not an alcoholic. Maybe that's my problem. Fur shurr, bra.

In the face of this, I am unhappy.

I want change even when there is no reason for it. I screw things up with people and with school just to make my life more interesting. I am unthinkably lazy. I don't do things I'm supposed to. I get crazy ideas in my head and am half compelled to act on them and turn my life completely upside down. I look at the ground when people talk to me.

The sad thing about this I will probably always be unhappy, at least in the near future. When I graduate and go to grad school or get a job I won't be happy. When I go back home unhappiness will set in once I have sat there for a while.

I am really a spoiled kid. I have been spoiled and I actually feel spoiled, like whatever that's supposed to make a person tick inside has just melted or gone stale.

I'm not turning to this for support.

Chances are I don't want it.

I don't really know anything right now. This is strange, as usually I know everything.

I don't think I'm going to get a job. I think that it will be easier just to buy a car and drive around and go to minor league baseball games and sleep in the backseat."

<P>When I was back in Tucson, a bunch of friends of mine were talking about how bad halftime shows were, and in time this developed into an exercise in which we were supposed to think of a trio of artists who would be really awkward performing at the same show or concert. It's really not that difficult, so this should be an interactive post. I didn't provide any commentary along with those, because I trust you'll be in the right mindset when you read them. Just picture all three of them kind of standing around looking at each other.</P>
<P>Here's what I have so far. Submissions should be in that format.</P>
<P>sproul's list:</P>
<P>Big 'n Rich, Jewel, Blue Man Group<BR>Gwen Stefani, Lord Finesse, Fantasia<BR>Duke Ellington (what?), The Clash, Young Redd<BR>Opio, Barry White, Cowboy Troy<BR>Busdriver, Garbage, Mary J. Blige <BR>Mario Winans, Pearl Jam, Insane Clown Posse<BR>Benny Goodman (obviously dead), Flashdance, Big Tymers<BR>Lionel Ritchie, Natalie Imbruglia, The Offspring <BR>Little Richard, Kottonmouth Kings, Whitney Houston<BR>The Postal Service, Nate Dogg, The Dixie Chicks<BR></P>
<P>my list:</P>
<P>Chingy, Slayer, Sixpence None the Richer<BR>Tori Amos, Aha, Paul Wall<BR>Royce Da 5'9, Tina Turner, Five for Fighting<BR>Dizzee Rascal, Something Corporate, King Missile<BR>Staind, GZA, Josh Groban<BR>Death Cab For Cutie, Pink, Brotha Lynch<BR>Howie Day, Martina McBride, Westside Connection <BR>Tony Bennett, Meat Loaf, Ron Artest<BR>Berlin, Toni Braxton, Jedi Mind Tricks<BR>Al Green, Foreigner, Nappy Roots<BR>Phil Collins, Gravediggaz, Ace of Base<BR>Stagga Lee, Yo Yo Ma, Powerman 5000<BR>James Taylor, P.O.D, C &amp; C Music Factory<BR>Styles P, Papa Roach, John Mellencamp<BR>Chicago, Mandy Moore, Kool &amp; The Gang<BR>Men at Work, Macy Gray, Los Lonely Boys<BR>Trina, Smash Mouth, Garth Brooks<BR>Bowling for Soup, Dream, Public Enemy<BR>Phil Collins, Bloodhound Gang, Cee-Lo<BR>Wu-Tang Clan, Alan Parsons Project, Gretchen Wilson <BR>Mike Jones, Tears for Fears, Charlie Daniels Band <BR>Saliva, Lloyd Banks, Tom Petty</P>
<P>Hope that got at least a few laughs. I'm in a little bit of a rut, I'm supposed to be writing something important and I can't start doing normal entries again until I finish it.</P>

"event","<!--StartFragment -->Senator HERB KOHL (D-WISC) : Judge, at the end of its term last year, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in Kelo v. City of New London that it was constitutional for a local government to seize private property for private economic development.
<P>Many people are alarmed about the consequences of this ruling because of the words of Justice O'Connor. Under the logic of the Kelo case, quote, ""Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz Carlton, any home with a shopping mall or any farm with a factory,"" unquote.</P>
<P>KOHL: So what is your view of the Kelo decision, Judge Alito?</P>
<P>ALITO: Well, what I can say is that it's a precedent of the court, and it built on the Midkiff decision, which had been handed down a number of years earlier.</P>
<P>I know that it touches some very sensitive nerves. When someone's home is being taken away, using the power of eminent domain, that is a blow to a lot of people.</P>
<P>Even if they're going to get compensated at fair market value for their home, the home often means more to people than just dollars and cents. It's a place that often involves a lot of emotion. They have emotional attachments to it. They've lived in it a long time. They're familiar with the neighborhood. They want to be with the neighbors they like. They want to stay in the same area. They may have emotional attachments to things in the home.</P>
<P>So it's a tremendous blow. And I suppose that when -- I would imagine that when someone's home is being taken away, a modest home, for the purpose of building a very expensive commercial structure, that that is particularly galling.</P>
<P>But Kelo was the decision of the court, and I've got my view about stare decisis. And should that issue come up again, then obviously the stare decisis factors would have to be considered. The stare decisis question would have to be the first question addressed. And the factors that I've discussed would have to be weighed.</P>
<P>KOHL: Well, your comment is, ""On the one, and on the other hand,"" and I do appreciate that.</P>
<P>KOHL: But I'd ask you, if you would, venture an opinion more precisely, specifically, do you agree in general with Justice O'Connor's dissent?</P>
<P>ALITO: Well, Senator, I don't think I can answer that beyond what I've said.</P>
<P>If the issue were to come before me and if I'm confirmed, then I would first have to consider whether there's any reason for not following Kelo, which is a precedent of the Supreme Court and grew out of the earlier precedent that I discussed, that I mentioned.</P>
<P>Now, I'm not suggesting which way I would decide that question of stare decisis, but that is the way our legal system works; that decisions are presumptively to be followed. And I would have to address that question.</P>
<P>If I got beyond it, I would have to go through the whole judicial process that is set up so that questions of constitutional law and other questions are decided in the best way, reading the briefs, listening to the arguments, participating in the conference and only after that reaching a decision on the merits of it.</P>
<P>KOHL: All right.</P>
<P><EM>Even if they're going to get compensated at fair market value for their home, the home often means more to people than just dollars and cents. It's a place that often involves a lot of emotion. They have emotional attachments to it. They've lived in it a long time. They're familiar with the neighborhood. They want to be with the neighbors they like. They want to stay in the same area. They may have emotional attachments to things in the home.</EM></P>
<P>What? What were you nominated for? Some middle-school documentary narrator? Host of Nightline? How can anyone in good conscience answer a question like that?</P>
<P>Why bother? Why ask questions when you don't expect an answer? What's the point of sitting there with your fat head in your hands while some dude talks a bunch of bullshit for 7 minutes, then follow up with ""All right""? It's not all right. It shouldn't be alright. It's only alright if you have to piss really bad and you don't care what the other guy says because it's not important.</P>
<P>It is important! This guy is important! What's the point of going through the motions for three days? I'm not going to give my reccomendation about Alito, because i'm a college freshman and not a law professor. I do know that he is adored by all the wrong people. But why are the people who are supposed to be on my side acting so dumb? When did they cease to become normal people who are interested in dialogue and legitimate answers to their questions?</P>
<P>I wish people would just do their jobs. Find out if this guy is crazy, ask him why he loves Bork, do some goddamn research, don't act like some senile old grandpa. Kennedy is the only guy who showed any balls; unfortunately he didn't have a lot of his shit together, so he wasn't much of a factor.</P>
<P>Chances are you don't know what I'm talking about, and it's a guarantee that you didn't watch any of these hearings. I don't blame you; I'm pretty sure I'm a masochist. The people on TV on my side did a really shitty job explaining to us why this guy is a little bit mean. Read <A href=""http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0112-21.htm"">this</A>, or <A href=""http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0110-30.htm"">this</A>, or <A href=""http://thinkprogress.org/2005/10/31/samuel-alitos-america/"">this</A>, if you're interested.</P>
<P>I doubt you thought any of this to be very pertinent, so this weekend I thought I would brighten everyone's day by talking about abortion.</P>

<P>I am halfheartedly playing out the conclusion of Western Illinois' third straight conference defeat, this one at home to Southern Utah. I've never figured out why I give myself so many headaches, trying to take a team nobody cares about from a school nobody's ever heard of and make them into a winner, year after year, in every video game I play. No one can shoot, one guy can rebound, and that tells the story of the 05-06 Leathernecks. A light knock on the open door, and an interested face peers in.<BR><EM>""What's goin' on, man? Aiyyo, is that the new one?""<BR></EM>It's one of the kids from directly across the hall. We have the same scholarship. I haven't really talked to him; then again, I haven't really talked to anyone. He seems like a nice guy, though. I saw him at the basketball season opener. You've gotta be a fan if you're willing to show up for that shit.<BR>""Yeah."" One word answer. My specialty.<BR><EM>""How is it? I got NBA Live, but I wanted this one, you can export the players into the draft right?""</EM><BR>""Oh...yeah, you can definitely do that. This plays different from Live, it's a lot about passing and defense, way more of a team game.""<BR><EM>""Really? Oh, man, that's great, that's what I like.""</EM> I am a bit surprised. If you looked at this kid you'd think he would be into the whole And 1 mixtape/NBA Street thing. He watches me finish my pathetic double digit loss.<BR>""You want to play?""<BR>He accepts and I offer him a chair. Illinois vs. Arizona gets underway. He takes a huge lead going into halftime. I rally in the last few minutes and tie it with 11 seconds to play. In between then, we talk casually, not confined to but primarily about sports. A fadeaway Dee Brown three-pointer over two guys at the buzzer. 78-75. He blows me out in the rematch.<BR><EM>""Hey, man, you have a safe holiday, take it easy.""<BR></EM>""Thanks, you too.""<BR>I used to live in Tucson, Arizona, a part of the world that he certainly has not the faintest understanding of its essence. Likewise, he is from The Bronx, New York. As you know, I am light skinned, and as you might have imagined, he is not. He is majoring in engineering, and I most certainly am not. We have nothing in common other than this one innocuous bond; there is no sense denying that. Both of us understand one small part of each other, though, and as far as I know, that is all that matters.</P>
<P><EM>Scene.</EM></P>
<P>Couldn't be more than five or six hours later. Standing outside the greyhound station, cold. Nine months ago, when I returned to Pittsburgh for the first time since I was born there in 1986, I liked it; I liked that it had character, I liked the old, tall, sad buildings, the hills and the waterfront and the grit and determination and the ghosts of American blue-collar life. But as I stare out at the rusty suspension bridge sagging over the Ohio, waiting for cab 380 to take me to the La Quinta Inn, I feel nothing but a bitter and deeply irrational emnity towards the Steel City.</P>
<P>Of course it isn't fair. Of course not everyone in Pittsburgh is completely backwards, of course not everyone is filled with intolerance and homophobia and ignorance, of course not everyone is pale or obese or loud or rich or stupid. If I went to Iowa State, I would think the same about Des Moines. I lived in Tucson and I hold the same steretotypes against Scottsdale and Paradise Valley and Gilbert.</P>
<P>I hear two guys behind me introducing themselves. One is a soldier, National Guard, just got back from Iraq. Tells the other guy the military changed his life. The other is in the Job Corps and is training to be a plumber. Tells the other guy that that's why he's doing this; get a job and make up for some of the bad stuff he did when he was kid, make a living and turn himself around. Two regular guys, coming from this city that I have convinced myself to hate, doing what they can do to make a life for themselves, telling their story to a complete stranger with no hesitation or embarrassment.</P>
<P>For God's sake. It's not Pittsburgh's problem, right? Isn't it mine?</P>
<P>Cab 380 pulls up. I hastily pick up my bags, walk down the wooden stairs, wave the cab down. The driver, a young, husky, scraggly white guy, rolls down his window.</P>
<P><EM>""You're going to the airport, right?""<BR></EM>""Yeah, the La Quinta.""<BR><EM>""Alright, get in.""<BR>""Whoa, whoa, man, hold on, man!""</EM></P>
<P>There are two guys behind me, different guys, but both black, like the soldier and the plumber.</P>
<P>It is worth noting that a person tends to learn some things when you travel a lot. One, the vast majority of people who travel by air are white, and the vast majority of the people who work in the airport are not. Two, most nice cars are driven by white people, and if a black person is driving a nice car, he will probably get pulled over by the cops at some point. (No, this doesn't just happen in episodes of Family Matters and in movies, I've actually witnessed this happen.) Three, many non-white people take buses to travel long distances. I am not going to analyze why this is the way it is; just know that this is indeed the way it is.</P>
<P><EM>""Hold on for what, I'm taking this guy to the airport, you're not going to the airport.""<BR>""Hey, man, we fuckin' called this cab, man!""<BR>""No, you fuckin' didn't, I got this guy, that's it!""</EM><BR>This would have been a good time to turn to the guys and explain to them that I actually did call this cab, they told me to wait for 380, and I did, and so I'm sorry, I can call another one for them if they want. Instead, I stand there.<BR><EM>""Hey why you gotta fuckin' use that language with us, dude?""</EM><BR><EM>""THEY CALLED THAT CAB!!!!!!!""</EM> <BR>A black woman near the bus entrance has begun to yell at the driver.<BR><EM>""If you swear at me, I'm gonna fuckin' swear at you, man, now I'm going to the airport!""<BR>""Fuck you, man, this is bullshit, man.""<BR>""Fuck you, he's got this fuckin' cab, now get the fuck out of the way.""<BR></EM>I get in the backseat and shut the door.<BR><EM>""FUCK YOU!"" "" THAT IS BULLSHIT!"" ""ASSHOLE!"" ""MOTHERFUCKER!""</EM> <BR>The people at the bus entrance have taken notice and are officially beside themeselves. The bus driver gives them the finger, and my first ever role as a supporting actor in the production of an extremely ugly racial incident is complete.</P>
<P><EM>Scene.</EM></P>
<P>Two or three minutes later, we're on the one of the beltways, stuck in traffic.<BR><EM>""Hey, I'm sorry about that, those people are just ignorant.""</EM> <BR>The little ID card on the dash says his name is Adam something, and he has a number of tattoos on his arms. I tell him not to worry about it, and launch into a very unsettled-sounding explanation of how unfortunate it was that that happened, because blah blah blah and it looked bad and who knows what else. He waits for me to finish, then - <BR><EM>""Yeah, man, it's stupid. I swear, they're all idiots. I'm going to the airport, which is like fifteen miles east, and all of them want me to take them to the Hill District,""</EM> <BR>Wait for it, wait for it,<BR><EM>""and there's no fucking way I'm ever gonna go there.""</EM><BR>I think it's one of those things where you had to be there, in the backseat with me. Then you would have heard it, and you would have felt how icy it was, and you would have seen everything I saw when I heard him say it. I think that even if you didn't know that the Hill District was the poor, black part of the city, you would have figure it out instantly, and you would have seen dilapidated houses and broken streets and glass on the sidewalks and weeds and maybe broken down cars and decrepit buildings. I don't know if you would have seen buses, white sheets, rope, trees, fires, marches, fire hoses, guns, night sticks, loud music, sirens. I don't know if you would have seen any of those things, but I did, and right then and there I lost hope for both of us. As I type and backspace and add punctuation and read what I have written, over and over and over again, I lose hope for both of us.<BR>Because, as I sat in the backseat of the car, stinging from the impact of what had just happened, I simply couldn't think of a way out. Was the driver wrong for being a racist? Yes, but his parents probably were, and the kids he went to school with, and the people he worked with, and apparently every time he picks up a white person black people yell at him. What do you do about that? Were the people at the station wrong for thinking the cab driver was a racist? Even though he was just doing his job, he did take me over them, and it looked bad, and plus he really was a racist. What do you do about that? How do you change the way that looks? What about me? Do I hold the cab and give a sermon? Or do as I did, shirk quietly in the backseat and hope that it all goes away,&nbsp;the&nbsp;same way&nbsp;a guy who was afraid of getting mugged or shot would?<BR>I asked him about the Penguins game, and he didn't know. I already knew there was a game. It is so incredibly far to my hotel that it gets dark before we get there. I tipped him 20%. He thanked me and wished me a good night as I carried my bags to the lobby. I didn't turn around.</P>
<P><EM>Scene.</EM></P>
<P>Sitting by myself in a four person booth. There's an old joke that La Quinta is Spanish for ""next to Denny's"". Can't argue with that. A cute waitress approaches my table to take my order. I don't know about you, but a cute waitress giving you a big smile is not something you prepare yourself for when eating at Denny's. I manage to look her in the eye and give a half-smile back. I ask what the specials are, and she suggests the cinnamon raisin french toast. I order the cinnamon raisin french toast.</P>
<P>It is dark, and the street outside is wet with melted snow. Yellow from streetlights and headlights shines overhead. The menu says I am in Moon Township, PA. A light snow begins to fall, which means nothing other than it is prettier, because snow it's already covering everything except the asphalt and concrete.</P>
<P>A family of probably eleven or twelve walk in, shaking snow off their hats and jackets. It looks like there are moms and dads and brothers and sisters and cousins all, and everyone gets to be at least two. They take up two booths across the non-smoking area from me, smiling, laughing, telling jokes, thankful to be inside and given an opportunity to eat. Two of the girls are about my age, and they both have really beautiful skin, almost the exact opposite of mine. It is a unique shade and it makes me jealous. Next to them, a couple is eating dinner with their infant child in his high chair, and he is playing with his food and squirming all over the place. His parents are trying to calm him down but I really wish they wouldn't, because he's not making noise, so why not let this little boy be amused with his own life?</P>
<P>The waitress brings my food, and she says she brought extra syrup. I tell myself that she did this because she thinks I'm sweet, and for the sake of the story we will stick with that. Her name is Shelley. Her&nbsp;dark brown hair is&nbsp;in a ponytail and as she takes the order of the people in the booth next to me, I hear her laugh. It's a phenomenal laugh. It starts on a fairly high pitch and stays the same for three sounds and then goes up just a little bit at the end. Her laugh makes me sad that she has to work at Denny's on a Friday night in late December when it's snowing and everyone with that kind of laugh should be at home with her mom and dad or her boyfriend in front of the fireplace watching old movies.</P>
<P>It's warm inside the restaurant. Temperature aside, from my experience, the colder it is outside, the warmer you feel inside. The party of 12 has just gotten their food, the couple is wrapping it up with their kid, Shelley has just refilled my water. Christmas carols are playing, pleasantly, on the speakers overhead. It's warm, and Christmas carols are playing, and I am 2500 miles away from everything I know. I am alone, but I look around and everything is okay, for a few minutes at least, and I am happy about that.</P>
<P><EM>What child is this, who, laid to rest,<BR>On Mary's lap is sleeping?<BR>Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,<BR>While shepherds watch are keeping?</EM></P>
<P>Just because of that laugh, I order a piece of pie. I'm full but goddamn it, I'm ordering a piece of pie.</P>
<P><EM>This, this is Christ the King,<BR>Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:<BR>Haste, haste to bring him laud,<BR>The babe, the son of Mary</EM></P>
<P>Sometimes I just don't know about us.</P>"

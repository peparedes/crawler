"event","so i was told last night that not only does my arch nemesis get a twitch in his eye everytime he hears my name, apparently he hated me enough to make an anti me website or some crap like that, but i bet it's just some half assed myspace page. i went looking for it today out of curiosity, but to no avail. 

so i guess the moral of the story is, before you go out and steal two (yes two) girls from someone (consecutivly or otherwise). just remember, they might make a crappy myspace page and talk alot of shit about you. but dont worry, they wont say a word when they look you right in the eye at one of their shows in there clubs surrounded by there friends.

"event","mind of a killer- into madness

i can still smell the burning cedar and the fume of sulfur, it's a taste that clings in the air, never fades, hanging on your clothes and hair. 

desperate cries of pain, sorrow, anguish. the fire can't drown out those lost souls. the first time you see it, you'll never forget it, you can't just let go and walk away. it kind of makes you sick in a way. i still cant help but feel a little nauseas at the thought, and sometimes i can still taste the sulfer and smoke, choking on it. 
but it had to be done. funny, how much like a wounded dog these things are. gnawing at it's trapped leg as i approached, gun in hand. it only took one bullet to splater it's face across the courtyard.

i fucking hate doing this shit in churches. i know im only doing what's right, but it feels so wrong. hopefully the locals here will take it better then the last town, im sure local authorities will write it off as an 'unsolved mystery'...i hope.

the last thing i need is another superstitious marshall and his posse of drunken avengers tailing me half way across the desert.

""how the hell am i supposed to explain this one?! and still no leads!""

*   *   *   *   *

""it came like black death, consuming and destroying...spreading. taking the essences and minds of all it's victims, and their mammed souless corpses began to walk the earth, feeding on those they once loved.""

who the hell writes these movies anyways? well, the newest batch of victims are in.

this one's missing his lower jaw. she's missing her tounge and eyes. go figure, he burnt down the houses too. the only thing they've found so far is a page of a dairy or a journal of sorts. it's almost like he's taunting the police. 

'ah sweet Mary, she was so patiant with me during those troublesome years. i should have never let her in. her screams still haunt me. like those of so many loved ones ive had to put down. the beast cosumes. haunting my every waking hour. the sight of her gnawshing and flailing like a rabid dog, it was too much to bear. her once beautiful eyes, empty hallowed sockets. peering, full of nighing. a sickness grew, as i said my goodbyes and goodnight. the trigger squeezed easy, silencing her painfilled cries forever. the fragments of her skull painted the wall so eligantly, falling like stars smeared across a late evening sky...'

oh great, he's a poet too. how nice."

"event","three years later

i went up to the park just the other day and sat by the river where we used to sit. we carved our names in the wood floor near the steps we used to sit on. we spent hours etching it in so deep, just to be sure it would stand the test of time, but when i looked around, i noticed it wasn't there anymore. it's kind of funny, it didn't last, neither did we. maybe when you came back to town you tried to tie up loose ends and justify what happend and how things went down. maybe you deleted it in spite. out of bitterness. it's no secret, things didn't end well. in fact we haven't spoken since despite my efforts to be cordial, to make amends, but i guess that's just the way things go. 
im not ging to apologize, say i was wrong, i know i could've been a bit kinder, more understanding when you tried to explain what you did was in the name of love, but this isn't because im stubborn, or about pride or principle. no, i knew very well what i was doing. i knew there would be no second chances, no happy endings, when i let go, pushed you away. i knew there was nothing left for us and i tried to explain but you didnt understand, hell, you probably never will. i wanted the best for you, i was a sinking ship and you had to move on. ive done too many selfish things in life. brought too many people down and dug them early graves to watch you be buried with me.
sometimes it's best policy to burn the one you love when you know you can bring them nothing but hurt in the long run. you were meant for better things, better places. a sunny spot on the west coast with a good job and a good life. all i could offer was an unstable future, a life of uncertainty on the streets of some no name town in the midwest. 
new days come and go, and i hope you dont think my words were meant simply as cruelty. just know it was with the best intentions in mind and out of lve that i did what i did and said what i said. though it may not have seemed so at the time. i dont think you'd have liked what ive become anyways. i guess if we werent so far away from eachother then maybe i could tell you all these things and if we tried hard enough we could see eye to eye and i oculd make you understand. but i gotta ask, would you really want to."

you don't see what i see and if i cut out our eyes would w see things the same. would we be on the same page. now our eyes burn and my throat bleeds from screaming at brick walls. my hands are raw from falling on deaf ears. but dont say enough is enough. because its never enough to let us get through tonight. now she says she dosent want this anymore, and i said i can't take it anymore. and you know, that gun is loaded. yeah she's got one more bullet and it's just for me. im half way asphixiated now, curled up at the bottom of a fifth. dashboard lights glow like my cigarette, and i think about all the fucked up things we said, i think about all the fucked up things you said. i've got you blowing kisses like bullets, if looks could kill, i'd have died the very first day we met. but then you say we can try again later and maybe things will get better, and who knows, maybe we can try again later. but ive gotta ask, will you help me next time you find me face down in the gutter? trust me when i promise not to cover for all the fucked up things i did when i was younger, you know i never meant to do you harm. you called while i was passed out on the floor. left a message and said your not coming home. and of course you know it's better sometimes to just let go. but no one said things would be easy. we knew we were destined to fail from the get go. 
i guess this was our calling all along. your chance to be apart of something. we grabbed it all, tore it down and pulled it apart. but this is my voice. and with it i will cast the first stone with my hands. with or without you, ill break down the walls and teach the world what it means to stand. if you hear you see and you breathe, what it means, an end to the means and an altered state of mind. it brings all new perspectives and the consequence if you listen close enough. you might find the top of a lethargic peak, shattered by our screams. and all the horrible things we said. so i guess we've got nothing left, but breathe the smoke and all the winds of change will bring the chips falling down like raining on a tuesday, burning our eyes clean. remember when i used to cough and bloods all i'd see.  i guess someday you'll know. when you're throats raw and eyes are shrink wrapped, that this is the calling to allwho would listen to a wretched tired old man's last dying breath.
but nothing could have ever prepared me for something like this. bitter sweet finding our lack of innocence. found endearments under pale moonlight, now trailing tears line your eyes. mascara stains your cheeks, lingering like kisses we should have never given, kisses like liquor on our breath, cold wet skin tainting soft hollowed sacred grounds under. what do we have left to fall back on now. you knew this would never work. nothing lasts forever. but i guess, i like you said, we'll always have this moment. smooth milky hands on lips of satin, eyes reflect our surroundings, lost in an ocean, caught in a blink, breathing in almost harmonic sequence. it reminds me that letting go is the hardest part"

 rain trickles down washing clean blood and sweat. the lingering smell of cigarettes, stains on your shirt. the pink of fresh cuts festering just below the surface, the faded brownish yellow of spilt booze from nights gone past. the wind blows, cutting razors to your cheeks, a sniffle and a cough as lights come and lights go from behind. blinded every few minuets by the cars passing along. stumble again on uneven pavement, broken glass, crushed cans, dead grass, cigarette butts, all lining the streets. the decay lingers all around, stifeling life out of what was once a vast scape of trees and feilds, streams and hills.
 stumble again. its been days without a restful nights sleep, insomnia lets you know that you are in fact slowly dying. pick the scab and it will scar, the razors edge eminds you that you are in fact very much still alive. cigarette burns fester on the underside of your arm, when's the last time you ate, days seem to blur together, lack of food or loss of blood, it's hard to tell these days. there should be sounds and you know this for fact. but everythings silent. all you hear is the last few choking echos she screamed in your face before she walked out the door. the first stone cast is always the worst. after that, everything is just numb and ringing in your ears. sometimes you wish the numbness would never fade, your only friend lingering until the sting of it bites again, gnawing through.
 but what else is eating at you. what skellitons are pounding on your closet's door, she found most of them, so it couldn't be much worse could it. no, not right now anyways, but a few more miles won't make much diference. a few more miles and you can bury it all at the bottom of another bottle, you can start this whole process all over again. maybe it will be better next time around. just one more mile, just one more bottle, just one more pill, one more of anything to let it all go. just one more mile to go."

it lingers like the scent of booze and stale cigarettes from the night before. another puff, exhale and with a smile of sweet releife, there it is. that sweet sensation of relaxing bliss. ah, the wonders of modern technology, the chemistry of it all, ah, the nicotine. 

you take another drag, lungs fill with smoke, and you find yourself wondering where the night went. but some how the mid day sun sucks that answer from you, or so it seems anyways.

the morning cup of coffee dosent seem to be helping, though it's bitter. it's strong. ""what was her name?""...
the taste lingers in your mouth, on your lips. and with another sip and another drag, the question remains. ""who was she? what was her name?""...

the morning paper brings it's usual blend of bad morning news. terrorists attack country such and such, so many dead, so many wounded. for more details see page 13. kids shoot up local high school. suicide rates on the rise, the stock market is falling, gas prices rising. oh...here's a real keeper. ""local killer still at large.""

sick bastard. they still haven't caught him though. kind of makes your skin crawl, how the victims face is pryed open in an over exaggerated expression of surprise. almost clownish. funny, it's almost like they're smiling. at least he had the courtisy of leaving this one's face.

under pale lit skies, somewhere down the railroad tracks. past the lakes and cemetary under trees of reds browns and greens. the night sky opens and welcomes as you lay on soft green grass. another leaf falls, drifting and quivering in the wind, do you remember times gone passed. look around, all the memories still linger in the air. perfume masking, drowning, gagging you like that night we sat in the gazebo in the freezing rain. i gave you my jacket so you wouldn't catch your death of cold, hoping maybe i would. you held me close and promised you'd never let go, but time wears everyone thin and in the long run you just proved me right. promises mean nothing unless inked in blood and you can't seal any deals with just a kiss. look around at all the memories in this place, you know, its kind of intoxicating. do you remember when, i do. we thought the good times would never end. we sat behind the trees near those old abandone cabins on the hill over looking the lake, i brought you flowers and wine that day. we sat in the sun, talking, nothing but lies, sweet little lies of hopefullness, of promises, of future plans. we put aside trivial worries of the world when we promised forever and i would've left everything behind if you'd asked. three thousand miles away and a three hour time differance, you said you couldn't take it. and i tried to reassure you, just till december, just till after the holidays. ill be there by new years. but you said you didnt want to wait. look at all the memories in this place, it's amazing ive stayed as long as i have. it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, just thinking about the three mile walk to meet you here just so you could say we can't do this anymore, there is no us. oh, and by the way, happy birthday. cold days or warm, i never should have made that drive down to visit you. fifty plus miles away, i should've told you i was staying, laying in the sun and finishing the merlot i bought for us last night. but no, i couldn't. if you said jump, id have asked how high. you wanted my love but i thought you were joking. and you never let me live that one down. i remember when we first met, sparks flew from the start. weeks passed and we spent every moment together, waking and other wise. finally you asked me to go places i couldn't yet go, bound by laws of youthfulness and age restrictions. these days i wonder what scared you so much about a three year age differance, you didnt think i was so young when we met. but now memories are all we have. i wonder if you kept the pictures i took of you, years ago underneath the trees. do you remember running across the feilds on those muggy days, heat strangling, to hold me close under the torrential down pour of the soccer fields sprinklers. or the times we were caught in the act down at the park after dark, a short drive from the twenty-four-hour supermarket where we used to wander around drunkenly, near the graveyard where you tripped and fell, startled by the wind off the lake. excuses we made to be close, to touch, to kiss, to linger and listen to the beat of two hearts of two lost souls, lovers, shunned by there own families, put out on the streets together. these days ive learned to love callousness and vagaries, knowning every word we ever whispered was nothing more then lies a way to feel wanted, needed. some hope that we wouldn't have to be alone. i guess i should thank you for that, all of you. for teaching me to stand on my own, to know that no matter what i may think, i am better off to question, i am better off this way and if you could only see how magically the chemicals burn off the old photographs, the letters, the notes. it's something else darling. ive never enjoyed a bonfire quite this much at least not sice we've walked our seperate ways."

"event","light the torches and grab the pitchforks, these are dangerous times we live in folks. nothing finer than an angry mob. there's no heroes here folks, just us, nothing more nothing less then the starved, lonely and depraved. lost in a sea of shades of grey. all lines blur when tensions rise. yes sir, nothing finer then an angry mob of hard working patriots with nothing to show for it. work hard for what you want and you too can someday have a shit hole of your own in the slums. someday you may too see your children grow up and bear more young of their own into a dying world. you can watch them struggle to meet prior set standards that no person may ever truly attain without being born into a higher society. no sir, sometimes faith alone just isnt enough. sometimes luck just isnt in your cards and there's a good chance that when you're down you will be kicked whether or not you try and get back up on your feet or just lay and take the blows of an uncaring world. so stop and think about how big the world you live in is. think about how small and insignificant your life is in comparison to the great scheme of things. stand up and look around and know that you are not alone. you will never be alone. no silence, no freedoms, no escape. look around and know that you are trapped. i suppose some things were just meant to be, but what is fate. some of us have other plans for our own existance. so who gave what ever powers that be the right to decide what life should be for us. and where have they all gone. a good act of a spiteful angry diety is what we need. too many peple, too much filfth. too much waste floating on the surface. when will it all be washed clean. wake up and know that i am clean. the cleanest ive been. i cant think of a time when things have been clearer for me, so when you see the streetlights and you take that long walk, understand who you are. where you came from and how you got there. ask yourself, is where you are going where you really want to be. we are all truly nomads and scavengers. creatures built for survival and eternal struggle, but the more you struggle, the more you sink and before you have time to blink, you're already knee deep in shit. so get out of the shit storm. get out of the frying pan and stay the hell out of the fire. look around. wipe the slate clean. sometimes we all lose our way, sometimes we are just all better off to get lost and sometimes that long walk is all you need. to see down the tracks, to look back on the beaten path and to see everyone else that is caught up in there own long walk. depending on your stance, your view, your walk in life, even the darkest clouds and the most forboeding in skies may reveal the most blinding of lights. its not often that we learn to just let go of everything we have, everything we know, everyone we've loved and trusted and turn a new page. but when we do, let me tell you friend it's fucking amazing. the free are truly free when you can learn to let the small things go, walk away, turn your back for once in your life. think and be just to be. there is so much out there and some of us will only ever see a fraction, a tiny piece of all the wonders that are right in our own backyards. it's all at your finger tips if you want it. you see, you hear, you touch, you are, you will be and if you think you've got it all, think again my friend. there's nothing the mind can't achieve."

blinded and covered, flashing images across all channels. you've gotta beleive me, man atomic energy just isn't what it used to be. all things considered though, i couldn't be better. so have a seat, have a drink and listen to the tales that ill tell. with an end so near, who really cares anyhow. deadmen tell no tales and the living lie with no ends in sight. one bomb or ten, it makes no differance, whatever gets the job done. quick, efficiant, clean. dead is dead and theres no coming back, no rest for the wicked and good guys dont always wear white. next time you come around ill let you touch a star. the clock is ticking and survival will be limited, step right up and we'll sell you out, buy you in and for a few dollars more we'll save you a spot in purgatory. destiny, karma, luck, fate... they're all bitches who only come around when things are at their worst, but damn.. they're the best ive ever had. ive done my good deed for the decade and trust me it wasnt worth shit in the long run because nice guys finish last and dicks like me are a dime a dozen. forget your common curtisy for a day, say the first thing you think, tell someone to fuck off, pick a fight, get drunk, have a one night stand and tell them they mean the world to you. then walk a mile in their shoes, walk a mile in mine. you'll know the fit's just not quite right and it might rub you the wrong way, but when your skin wears thin and your shins and ankles are raw and sore. just remember how it felt to walk that walk, tread that path. a dozen burdens and a million lies. whats it worth now? do you feel better now that you're burnt out and used up. not me. i feel like shit but i keep on truckin. when you feel like you need a bullet or a knife or a pile of pills to ease those pains. look at the scars youve earned, look at all you've done and all you've been through. know that there is a certain aspect that most give into, but it carries you through and if you wipe away all the blood, sweat and tears. you'll find the bottom of a barrol, held together by something tougher then empty blind faith. touch this, be burnt. know how it feels. one million lights torch the skys burning away, one million watts, one million decibles and a thousand unspoken words, broken fragmented thoughts, fragments of what we know we have and everything we wished we could've been. under night skies and wind will howl and i can see now we have no where left to go. two a.m. and minuets tick by like the hours we've left behind, forgotten. no promise of tomorrow, no hope for new futures. everything is falling into place peace by peice. unearthed from the remains of those past and present. desecrated ruins, no sanctity in our modern mans age. computers talk for us and run, ruin our lives. the ultimate convienance for the ultimate price. our souls salvation can be found somewhere on the net im sure. blistered limbs will reach clean through and if you let them they'll give you the world, or at least drop the dime and put you away, out of our misery. three hots and a cot, not such a bad deal if you ask me. but understand it's not out of anger, hatred, or passion that i speak these words, no, just idle hands spewing words. from my mouth to your lips, to your mind, know that words are the match that lights thie fire and once the torch is lit, the revolutions will burn bright. ashes will fall on the decay of civilization in its great decline and who knows where we go from here or there. but let me tell you friend, it will be beautiful. and when you find me, know that my hands are clean and my conscious blank. torch my body, torch my soul, set my heart and mind ablaze and find me under the trees of days gone by, running on empty and we've got nothing left to give. sieze up, give in and make room for the change of the guard and watch the torch get carried on by the next generation."

"event","incoherant ramblings from a caffine and nicotine filled rant. unedited from the resturant placemat...


modern conceptions, obsessions and the turning of times back to better days when we enjoyed the simpler things in life. no troubles, no bother, no fear in consequence, those were the days. back when things just seemed to fall into place. when i was hopeless and we were romantics waiting for society to collapse in upon itself, as foundations crumbled spewing dirt and dust into the air, we were clean, breathing smoke. playgrounds of rust and broken glass. we say under stars on the rooftops of cars, summer nights just seemed longer back then or are we just losing hope. the games we used to play no longer hold the same interest, nights shorter, days longer, dripping with monotony. the usuals and the regulars stay longer, and we all can't escape inevitablities of growing up and growing old. hardships, burdons now own our hours. the doomsday devices and super villans have all gone away and all our dreams are exactly that, only dreams.  modern pharmisuticals replace our minds with incoheriant ramblings and offer no end in sight to the list of endless side effects, but we tell ourselves it's worth it. to fit, to go about our lives like fresh pressed cookies. we've lost a certain aspect of despiration. with any luck, no one will notices the events transpiring. calm, serene, anything to go unnoticed. no escape to the endless cycle. no finish line to the race. where are all the felons, the revolutionaries. corperations own the earth and the stars and every waking hour. every moment of every day, and despite a certain element of hopefullness, a clear look through the haze would show that the idea of free thought came with a price, but we gave it back wholesale. no refunds, no exchange. no shirt no shoes no fucking service. push a button and send them home in a body bag. one small step for us and one giant sheet of glass for the world. religious wars funded by corperations seeking to profit off of foreign investments, common interests of those who pull all the strings and hold all the keys. thank you for your patronage, we now own you. get up, get out, go to work, go to sleep. wash rinse repeat. if you;re lucky, we might have social security by the time you're too old and useless to eve take care of yourself. friends and loved ones, we are gathered here today to honor our living dead. nine to five every day until that flesh bag corpse of a body decays into nothing. dust. but dont worry, you can watch other peoples lives, we've got them doing everything you wish you could do. yes folks, it's true we really have done everything. the eighties and seventies are making a come back , we're just too dumbed down to realize. you best watch what you say, if you arent pc you might get taken away. summer camp, concentration camp, reprogramming camp, whatever.. same thing. just repackaged with a smile for our conveinance.  are we really on top of the food chain. i suppose that means we should eat each other. it's only fitting. we already slaughter, mame, and royally screw each other over on a deaily basis. next time you're walking down the street, look at the muck, the shit storm of humanity, dripping, diseased, parasites carrying parasites. and understand just how thick the ties are that bind us. call it eccentric call it drug induced call it anything but clean. this is the damned existance, a world of lost souls. cattle waiting for a merciful turn in the slaughter house. that is life. touched by angels in all the wrong place. its okay if you're part of the clergy though, right? soloumn vows are empty words given on hollow grounds. save your soul, give em hell, and for what its worth, ive never really liked any of you. but a gun is just a gun, unless you've got a bullet. then you are god. theres no heroes in our sunsets and no extra guys when you really fuck up. game over is game over. so when we next meet dont ask me how ive been because i know you dont want to know, and idle conversation is for the fucking sheep. and if you've been touched by your god lately, id file a restraining order. a swing and a miss is still a shot and it's worth a try when things are looking down and the leaves start to fall. bliss is my greatest illusion, the grand scheme and my ultimate down fall. so have a cigar boy, sit down. you;re gonna do fine, you're never gonna die. and if you beleive that line of shit, then everything will be alright. now understand just one thing, if i ever said to you that im not happy its because you've worn out your welcome, the fact is, nice people just dont cut it. your credit sucks and so does your taste. im not an asshole, im just honest... and an asshole. it could be worse. i could be worse. so for now lets just call it even and leave it at that. i may be broke but im not broken. so thanks to those who can go the distance, ill be sure to kill you last. though if i were to say you can always count on me, id be lying. but if you get nothing else out of me, understand this, hippies are worthless, sorry folks, it's true. the revolutions over and the man won. sorry for ya, but you can't spread free love and world peace by being dirty and lethargic. everyones got their price, so how low can you go, just to keep up appearances. sell yourself short and be prepared for a whole new out look on life. you've already sold everything else, you might as well. im sure you'll get a good deal on e-bay. in only a fraction o the time it took you to read this, you'll have already forgotten why you started in the first place, your curiosity will have been subdued and broken by time and the barrier of nihilism that you've been force fed and programed with all your life. enjoy"

- Fire people exhibit righteousness. These people conform to the
standard of moral law. They do what is right and are known for their
sense of fair play. They are truthful, straight-forward, just, upright
and virtuous in their dealings with other men.</p>  
<p><u>Core</u> - They demonstrate courage, fortitude, zeal and
pugnacity. They have the mental and moral strength that enables them to
venture into unknown waters and to persevere and withstand danger. They
seldom show fear and are confident in their actions. They have mettle,
resolution, and tenacity. They can face danger or difficulty without
flinching or retreating. They will fight for their principles and have
a stubborn persistence that is unwilling to recognize defeat. They have
grit, back bone, guts, and are willing to keep fighting under all odds.
They are aggressive and thrive on challenge.</p>  
<p><u>Nature</u> - Their essential characteristic qualities are
liveliness, energy, ardor, enthusiasm, courage and action. They have a
firm, courageous and assertive disposition which is their most
characteristic qualitiy.</p>  
<p><u>Drives</u> - These people like to win or be the best in anything
they pursue. Their aggressive nature makes them just one big ego. There
is nothing more stimulating to them than to win, and there is nothing
more depressing to their ego than to lose. They strive to be the center
of attention and are at home when showing-off.</p>  
<p><u>Vice</u> - They are determined, spiteful and revengeful. When
angered, they will go to almost any extreme necessary to get revenge,
and that revenge will more often be at the moment of the anger. When
they're mad they want everyone around them to be mad. They are spiteful
and will deliberately and openly do things which irritate someone to
the point of anger. They are very short-tempered and anger easily. They
are straight-forward and have no reservations about hurting the
feelings of others, and they are prone to inflict physical pain as well
as mental pain. Just as the main virtue of this sign is being just and
right, its main fault is deceit.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=""center""> <img src=""http://is3.okcupid.com/mt_pics/112/11277203805898682283/7056991957307027883-1.jpg""> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><br> <table cellpadding=""20""> <tbody><tr> <td> <span id=""comparisonarea"">My test tracked 2 variables How you compared to other people <i>your age and gender</i>:<blockquote><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""4""><tbody><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""138""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""12""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>92%</b> on <b>Extroverted</b></td></tr><tr><td valign=""middle""><table bgcolor=""black"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""1""><tbody><tr><td bgcolor=""#b2cfff"" height=""20"" width=""123""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td><td bgcolor=""white"" width=""27""><a href=""http://www.okcupid.com""><img src=""http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif"" alt=""free online dating"" border=""0""></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign=""middle"">You scored higher than <b>82%</b> on <b>Chaotic</b></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></span> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <table cellpadding=20><tr><td>Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=4477963500138668623'>The Which Element Are You?

"event","so my plans for warped tour fell through. this is the first year i havent attended since i was a freshman in high school. i slept all day after i came to some horrible realizations on people i called friends, people i trusted. and a few ive made about life in general. im starting to think that maybe i should leave michigan for a very long time. ive kind of burnt out all my options save a few. i guess theres always the option of going active duty, that'd be a rough six years. but it get me out of this place, away from these people...have you ever felt trapped, alone? stuck in a reutine...its exactly where i never wanted to be. if it werent for me being so easily amused, i dont know what id do. id probly go crazy. well at least i know what they're up to...i know what they're doing. what they've done. laugh it up while you can...im not as dumb as i seem. ive got a few more tricks up my sleeve still...operation apple sause is in effect. so watch out evil doers...."

i hopefully will have my funding in on the 1st. which means car, and yes folks. even a cellular telephone. 
crazy, i know. its been a very long time since ive had one of those. but ill have a car just in time for all the super crazy ska fun concerts that are coming up. woo hoo! fuck yeah, the aqua bats! thats gonna rock my socks. im also thinking of going to deviate detroit this year and causing some trouble. that or at the subhumans show. 
on another note. the weekend forecast... today; when sean gets up i think we're going to some weird bookstore down in detroit. or did he do that yesterday....oh well. i think thats todays plan. tomarrow; gaming all day long. woo hoo. sunday ill probably be sleeping from the late night game session. probably hang out with kelli later in the day. anyways. hopefully you all have a wonderful weekend. take care, kill a hippie.

"event","So I'm officially getting my own place...yea buddy!!  I move on April 22nd and can't fucking wait.  You know the rumor that you should never live with your best friend is completely true.  Although maybe it would have worked out if she had actually gotten a job and I didn't have to pay for everything for the past two years.  Or maybe things would have worked out if she had actually trained her dog.  How hard is it to fucking potty train your damn dog?  Come on now!  But you know what, shit happens and I'm excited as hell to get my own place.  Who wants to have a drinking party???  Other than that absolutely nothing is new.  Still working at Payless, still going to school, and just enjoying life being 21!  Well, there is a bunch of beer downstairs calling my name...yea buddy!"

"event","Why the fuck does dating have to be so goddamn difficult?  I don't fucking understand.   Am I that fucking ugly or retarded.  Or am I just fucking missing something.  Here I am thinking things are going great and then this shit happens.  What the fuck is going on?  First I come over to hang out and your ex girlfriend is there, what the fuck is that?  Then you completely ignore me the rest of the night and then tonight after we had made plans you fucking blow me off!  What the fuck is wrong with me?  No, what the fuck is wrong with you??  Why is it that every guy I have feelings for completely shits all over me.  I just don't get it.  I'm just done with it all, I'm fucking done with dating, done with guys, done with everything.  So until some guy comes and sweeps me off my feet, I'm fucking done with all men.  Yea I'm fucking done with you."

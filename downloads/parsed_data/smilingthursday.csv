There were people marching for U.S. troops. There were peoplr protesting the war. There were people marching on the mall for immigration. This is America I guess. There were people wearing blu tee-shirts saying ""God hates fags"". Wow. Interesting place to live. I'm watching the movie Jarhead right now. Weird movie. I don't know, I guess living here kinda opens your eyes.

"event","Today Chad left on deployment for New Orleans. He's on the USNS Comfort which is a hospital ship. They're going to pull into New Orleans harbor and basically become New Orleans General Hospital for as long as it takes. The Navy told him he could be gone for up to 3 months, though it could be longer. This is his first deployment and I feel so sad right now. I'm going to miss him so much. It's amazing how much love you can feel for one person. I feel selfish by wanting him to stay, but those people need so much help. I keep thinking about how they are living down there right now and about how so many of them are dying. I am so thankful that my boyriend is going to be there to help. I hope that New Orleans can start getting it back together and that not too many more people die."

We still talked regualrly, but then it just kind of faded. I was looking at my scrapbook and she is all over it, including a whole page devoted to her. It made me sad, maybe a lot sad. We were so close and now... It's strange how the universe has different plans for us. I thought we would be friends forever, but I guess ""forever"" friends are hard to come by. I called her over a month ago and she was busy and she said she'd call me the next day. Never did. I am sad. She was so important to me at the time. I dunno.

When that shit is going on I feel like I'm 13 again- THE WORLD IS ENDING!! Good Lord. Started school again in January- surprisingly refreshing and it keeps me a little more occupied. Learning to trust again, slowly but surely, I still have my doubts though. My Dad is getting re-maried and I am SO happy for him. She is adorable and totally nice, plus I'll have two new sisters and a new brother, though I doubt I'll ever talk to them much. Everything was closed down today except my gym (yay!) b/c of 8 inches of snow. Got a tatoo a while back, considering another though I swore I wouldn't. Oh well, they were right, I admit it. Going to Vegas in November for my 21st birthday, so excited already. Well, other than that life is boring other than my books and an occasional night with my boy (he works night now), but it's good for us, very good. Hmmm... that's all folks!"

"event","So, lucky me, I just started school again! It's amazing how stupid you can feel after being out for 9 months. I'm taking this class, Mathematics for Educators, which means I'm learning stuff I'll be teaching elementary kids when I get mt certification. Now, it seems like it would be easy, but it's not. Most of this shit I havn't had since like 4th grade so I've forgotten most of it. Sigh... it feels strange to be back in school. And the dynamic of my relationship has changed as a result to. I know Chad has had a bad history of his exes, including his ex-wife cheating on him, so he is worried that I will meet some college guy and leave him. Yeah right. I love this boy like crazy, I hardly even notice other guys. So, of course I try to reassure him as much as possible. Anyway, I'm not too worried about it, cuz it's not going to happen.

As an aside... I LOVE YOU LAUREN! I miss you and I think prehaps I will call you this weekend. I was thinking that you, me, and D all need to meet up in some part of the country some time this year and have some mostly legal fun. What do you think?

"event","""I like to save a couple of the marshmellows for last but it never works. I usually end up with the flaky stuff and some pink milk... I get distracted."" You might be wondering, ""What the hell?"" Well, I know this quote may make no sense, but for some reason it's the only one that stuck with me from the movie Garden State. I have made a few realizations within the past week, which is actually normal when I visit my grandparent's house. My Grandmother (who I call Nana) is someone who inspires me beyond anything I read or hear. Even if we don't talk about anything relevent to what I have been thinking about. Always has been that way. Anyway, somehow this quote really sums up a lot of things for me right now.

I'm not sure how many people know (besides Lauren and Gabby of course) know the real reason I left Florida. It was a severe ""episode"" of depression and anxiety. I have dealt with this so called disease, which I prefer to call a condition, since I was 12 (8 years now). It was no surprise that my first feelings of such condition happened at or around the same time as the seperation and inherint divorce of my parents. I have taken medication on and off since then, though I'm not so sure how safe anti-depressants are for people under the age of 18. Anyway, I think this leads a lot to the feelings and consequent thoughts I have today.

The woman who said the aformentioned quote is a lot like my mother in many ways, though I never experienced her in this exact state, but in many others if you know what I mean. And somehow I could relate tonight. The kids (actually probably a few years older than me) were doing drugs and having fun and experimenting. For some reason I was drawn to the whole scene and wanted it in some unacknowledged desire. I have experimented with several drugs, but I don't know what it was about this particualar arrangment that attracted me so much. Of course because of my mother I know how horrible certain drugs can be and the harm they can bring to yourself and the ones you love. Yet... I was still so drawn to it. Maybe I do have an ""addictive personality"" as they say, but I show no signs of it thus far. I guess I have several years ahead of me however. 

I don't really know the point of this, as you may have guessed. I think I am just confused and maybe a little scared."

"event","So many people are damaged in so many ways. When you are a child you think your life will always be perfect, that nothing can hurt you. Can you believe I actually used to want my parents to get divorced because I thought my family was ""just too normal"". How awful is that? It's like all the little things that happen to us scar us, if only in little ways. Like someone doesn't call you on your birthday, you are so sad. A boyfriend in 8th grade breaks up with you and you have another scar. I realize that adversity is good for people and I won't argue with that. I've just been thinking about the wounds inflicted on people that never turn into scars, they just stay open wounds, never healing and never feeling better. There are so many people with so many scars and wounds. I wish I could help people with their scars, I really do. I think in a lot of ways I have dealt with a lot of my scars, except those from high school. And there are a shit ton of those. But most of the big ones, save Michael, I have dealt with. I want to help other people help themselves and overcome their scars. I know I will one day overcome the Michael scar, hopefully soon. I have a book that I think can help a lot of girls, and even boys. I made a book of the best excerpts for my little sister before I left for school ad I think in a lot of ways it helped her. But is a book really enough? No. It's not. It has helped me in inumerable ways, but still it has a lot to do with you. I still need to grow in so many ways to overcome all of my challenges. I have several now that I am struggling with and the solutions havn't come to me yet, although I have been searching for the answers for months. Do you think they will come. I sometimes have the flame of my faith flicker and almost burn out. I grab and grasp at my strength, at my resolve to get through it, to overcome all of my conflicts. But here is the problem... never has the conflict been imbedded within me so much as it is now. I have this desire to change so many things but the motivation.... it just seems so lost. I mean, I really, really do want to change, but I can't quite figure out how. All of the pieces are there but I can't get the puzzle together. It's just so foreign to me."

I tell myself every time that the last time was the last time and I am telling myself that now, but when you find something that you can get drunk of so easily and not taste it it's easier said that done. Okay, enough of this, I am going back to hang-over hell."

"event","Okay, so I havn't updated in awhile but A LOT has happened. First, camp is over. Thank God. I looked at pictures today and it made me want to puke. 

Second, I am taking a semester off and moving back home. I'm taking my time geting there though, and it will probably take me about three weeks to get there. I left at the right time though, right before that bitch Frances hit. My first stop is Maryland to visit my boyfriend who actually just asked me to marry him last night. I said NO. Just kidding, that would be freaking insane because I love him so much, but it won't happen for awhile. So, we are un-officially engaged. 

After this I am on my way back home and I'm going to stop in St. Louis to see Denise for a couple of days. I might possibly go to Michigan as well to see some relatives, but I'm not sure. 

I can think of nothing better that my summer money could go toward than a little traveling accross America. Fun. I am really enjoying myself right now and I love the fact that I'm not really sure what I am doing tomorrow or even a week from now. I am just happy. 

Anyway, that's my story. Life is changing yet again, just when I thought I had shit figured out, but I guess Fate has some other plans for me. And also a sense of humor."

"event","So I have less than 2 weeks at camp now. It was two weeks from yesterday and I found out last night that I get to see my adorable boyfriend on the 13th in Boston. HE is going to stay over with me so I won't have to stay in the airport over night. It was unexpected and I am excited but also nervous b/c I will not have seen him in about 6 weeks. I miss him so much that sometimes I just try to push thoughts of him to the back of my mind. It seems like that is the only thing that hepls these days because I fear that if I let a thought of him slip into my head I will just start feeling shitty. This has been a HARD summer and I am really looking forward to going back to Orlando and school. Yes, I do like school, so shoot me.

For anyone who hasn't heard, Denise isn't coming back this year so I am now going to be living alone! I am so excited (sarcastic). It will probably end up being okay and I think maybe it will be good for me to live by myself for awhile, I need alone time and I think that a semseter of doing what I want when I want will be good for me. I will be able to just sleep when I want, go to the gym when I want, eat when I want, all the nice things I can't do here in hell. I am counting down the days now and am so happy to be leaving this place. I think maybe I learned a lot over this summer, but none the less I want to leave. I think this quote explains how I feel about this summer: ""I'm glad I did it mostly because it was well worth, and cheifly because I will never have to do it again.""   If anyone ever hears me talking about coming back here after this summer just tell me to SHUT UP! Because I hate it here. 

Anyway, I will be home in 17 days! Yay!"

We are still in pre-camp phase so every night is a night off at this point. The horses are awesome and I can only think of one other place that I would rather be all day. It is so relaxing to be doing something that I really love. It takes my mind of of everything that is going on and all of this manual labor really de-stresses me too. I havn't smoked in almost two months and I am almost positive that it is good for me. I miss it a lot sometimes and at times I wish I had an eigth, but I really think this is good for me. God and I had a long talk today too while I was at the pasture doing some stuff. It was interesting and I thought a lot and came to a lot of conclusions about certain things. It's all still a little jumbled in my head so I will attempt to explain later, but it was good. I still miss Chad like no other, but I can breathe this week at least. He is coming out here in 13 days and I can't wait. I just want to kiss him and never stop. I also looked at some schools in D.C., but I'm not sure what will happen there. I know he really wants me to come out there since him moving to Florida is not even an option, but who knows what will happen. I think no matter what happens with him, everything will be okay and everything will be as it should be. I'm getting my tattoo at some point this year since I have finally decided what I want. Now I just need to decide where to get it. Anyway, I am really tired and my mind is beginning to fail me so I think I should go to sleep. I miss everyone who is reading this, goodnight!"

He waitied at the airport until he couldn't see me anymore and the he went outside and watched my plane take off. I really don't deserve a guy like that. He is unbelievable, more so than anyone I have ever met. He will be in RI in a couple of weeks and then he will be coming to see me *grin*. He makes me happy like no one ever has and no one ever will again. Everytime I kiss him it takes my breath away. 

Okay, enough of that shit. I made myslef cry. When I talk about him it's like hitting my thumb with a fucking hammer. I rode today and worked at the barn all day.

I am excited for camp to start too. I leave on June 7th, so not too long now. I have to go ride tonight so I can actually know what I am talking about when I go there. I'm going to try to do ten lessoons before I go, but that works out to about $283 total. Not too bad actually and I have been working a lot, so whatever. I love riding more than anything in the world, so it is worth it to me. In fact, I love it even more than smoking, which by the way, I havn't done in almost a month. Amazing I know. I miss it like hell though. But, alas, we shall have our new apartment fairly soon, and you know what that means D! :-)

Let's see, what else is new?... Not a whole lot I guess. I got a new motorcycle and I am going to go ride it this weekend, all weekend long. I wish it was a new horse, but my Dad will never buy me one of those. never has, never will. I guess if I ever get married (blah), I will make my husband buy one for me. Otherwise, I will have to get a really good job as a single chick and buy my own damn horse. Hehe. I am rambling way too much. God, I need to get a life. I found an old gift card from GAP that I have had for like two years and it still has $32 on it, so I think I may go buy something later on today. I know GAP sucks big time, but free is free and they have cute and comfy bras. Anyway, I guess I better go do something before I go ride. Yay!

I am at my Dad's office right now since it's the only place I can get on the internet. We got back from Utah last night. The drive back seemed really long because by the end of it I just wanted to be home already. We got back and I was so tired, but I was really into this book by Dean Koontz so I stayed up late reading it. Then my brother wakes me up at 7 am to ask if I could drive him to get his UA. I grudgingly agreed and with sleep still in my eyes drove him over there.

Then, when I was on my way over here, I got a fucking ticket! Fantastic is it not? It was for turning right at a red light when there were two signs saying ""NO RIGHT TURN ON RED"". It;'s for $90 and 3 points. Oh well, I will just go to court and get it reduced. It's my first ticket ever, which is pretty good, so my Pops isn't too pissed.

Anyway, I guess that's about it for now. Life is not too terribly exciting when I am at home, and also not nearly as dramatic. I feel sorry for everyone who is stuck in Borlnado, it's nice to be away for a few months.

And to the person who is one of the biggest liars I have ever met: SCREW YOU. Go jump off a cliff or something because you are fake and you are a stupid little liar. And we all hate liars. You are one of the most hypocritical and fake people I have ever met, and I am SO glad nothing ever happened beteween us. Get a life, loser.

I am very glad this year is over. It's been rough, I'm not gonna lie. It's weird how as it's all going on you don't really realize just how rough it's been, until you look back on all of it. While everything is happening, you are just sort of in survival mode, just dealing with all of the stress with a natural instinct to get through it as best you can. And then you look back and you just say, ""Holy shit! This whole year has been really hard, and i didn't even realize it!"" At least that's how I feel. I think so much has changed in me, that I won't even realize most of it for quite awhile. I think most of the change is good, but some is definitely bad. I guess there is always bad with the good huh? At least I realize those things that have changed for the worse, so maybe I can work on changing them. 

One things for sure: I am a sarcastic asshole. I just can't help it. There are so many dumb people out there to make fun of, and so many other things to ridicule as well. Sometimes I just say to myself, ""Rachel, put a lid on the sarcasm. Just for a minute so you don't look like a bitch."" I think maybe sometimes people may take some of the stuff I say seriously, but I asure you all, I am just joking around. I am an asshole and I like to make fun of people. So, if you ever do anything stupid I will definitely make fun of you for it, but relax, I still love you. By the way, you can make fun of me back. Denise does it all the time. You know what I'm talking about D! She has this laugh that is the ""making fun of Rachel laugh"" that just puts me in my place.

Well, I am off to go in the old people's hot tub and RELAX! I will never, ever live in a dorm again!!! Thank you God!!!"

"event","Well, let's see... it's only 3 more days until I go home. I have my only two final tomorrow which should blow, but after those I will have a huge sigh of relief. This year has been nothing short of... crazy. Let's do a quick recap:

1) Arrived at school and I was terribly homesick. Cried a lot at first and then I met Julie in my Psych. class and we started hanging out a lot.
2) Julie turns out to be totally obsessed with her boyfriend and doesn't ever want to go do anything b/c she thinks she will piss him off. At this point I am misssing Michael like hell and he is missing me too, but he is breaking down so everything is going to shit there. Long distance will do that. BEWARE. So... sadly Michael and I are over shortly before his birthday. It was the best relationship I've ever had though.
3) I meet Jett in my science class. We start dating pretty much right away. I ask Denise to come hang out with us like the first week he and I are dating- best choice I've made this whole year.
4) Relationship with Jett is complete shit. All in all we break up three times and we fight, oh, about three hundred times. Basically, he is a dick with too many personal problems to count, and I am a lonely heart-broken girl. Not a good combination. Ends VERY bad, at around Christmas Break. HUGE sigh of relief.
5) BUT... Denise and I hang out for the rest of first semester and we become pretty good friends. Granted, there was a lot going on with both of us, all due to guy trouble, as usual. Anyway, we were there for eachother and we began to hate all of those dumb ass girls together. :-)
6) Oh, I must add- we also met Linsey in about October. Seemed nice enough and she was pretty cool for awhile, but now she is just... Linsey. Good old unreliable Linsey. Needless to say, we don't really like her anymore.
7) OKAY... so first semester is OVER!!
8) Second semester starts out bad. The very day I get back I have to go pick Denise up from Jett's... not exactly a place I want to go again. Bad memories.
9) About two weeks later, I start dating Tom. He is adorable, tall, and pretty hot. But SO quiet. This kid barely speaks. It was a pretty fun relationship and I got a free Universal/IOA Pass out of it. Yay. Anyway, we broke up. Sad for a lil bit.
10)Here's the funny part: Ever since Holloween I had been dating a guy named Justin. He was 22, cute, and liked to take me places. It was nice, but none of the other boys knew. I know, I am terrible. But, him and I never ""did anything"" if you know what I mean. He seemed to just like giving me stuff for nothing. He was a nice guy. Too bad I had to kill him. J/J!!! We stopped hanging out in like March.
11) Decided- NO MORE BOYS! Made D swear she wouldn't let me. So I have been SINGLE more or less since January. HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF. Life was good.
12) The rest of this semester has been alright. Smoked a lot of weed with D, hung out a lot. Honestly, I have no idea what I have been doing for the past four months, expect school every now and then.

There was alot more that happened this semester, but alas, I have some memory loss due to... oh what was that due to? I dunno.

So, question... why is everyone so fucking depressed and crazy lately? Honestly people, get over it!! It's starting to make me angry. You give someone advice on how they should help themselves not be depressed, but do they listen to you? NO! I know, okay. I have been on the freaking medicine for 7 years! Whatever, they can figure it out themselves!

Anyway... I am LEAVING soon! I will write when I get home to Colorado! Yay!!"

Anyway, I am SO happy that this year is almost over. I go home in eight days. My dad called me today and informed me that he was going to cut my beautiful puppy's hair so he would look like a lion. I told him I would start crying if he did that so he said he would just get a regular cut. I really would have cried too. I love my dog too much and if he looked like a lion I would just be so sad!

Today is an okay day. We are supposed to go to Daytona and when we had planned it earlier, it seemed like it was going to be great, but now I think it may just suck. We are not gonna have enough weed for all of us, and I'm not drinking, so I dunno... it may just blow. Ah, whatever. 

Dumb ass biatch called me today wondering what was going on in Government and when our paper is due and I am not calling her back. She sits there and talks shit about me and Denise every fucking day and then she expects me to help her. What a dumb hoe.

Anyway, obviously I am in a very bad mood right now and my roomate is talking really loud on the phone and she's been on it for like an hour and a half.

I want this year to be done, I want my new apartment, I want to see my family and my dog, I want to be able to just sleep till whenever until June, but most of all, I want to get stoned. ASAP!!

Yesterday we went and put the deposit on our apartment and so I think everything will be good with that. They said we have a very good chance of getting an apartment, but you never know with those things I suppose. But, at least it's going and we should know if our apps. were accepted soon. We made a list of all of the stuff that we need for our apartment and I am SO excited. It's going to be so awesome living with D. We are going to have the best time!

I registered for classes yesterday too when we got back. I got the best schedule ever! I have 16 credit hours but I only go to school 2 days a week. How sick is that?!? Two of the five classes are internet, and one of them is mostly internet. So this means I can get an awesome job and not fail all of my classes like some people I know *coughAmber*. My Dad was like, ""Are you actually going to learn anything?"" And I was like, ""Dad, I can get a really good job and work a lot more with this schedule. He was all excited and was happy that I'll actually get off my lazy ass and make some god-damned money next semester.

I found out I have a 'C' in Statistics so I'm not going to class the rest of the semester or taking the final since it's optional. I know a 'C' isn't that great, but as my dad says, ""'C' is the first letter in credit."" So I guess he doesn't really care and neither do I. It's just a stupid gen-ed anyway

Other than that... I go home in 10 days! I am sooooooo happy about that. The weekend after I get back we are driving to Utah to see my lil sister. I will be happy to see her but it will be a sad meeting however. But, the four of us excluding my bitch mom will all be together for the first time in like 5 years. That's so weird, but it will be awesome. I also get to see my bro when I go home and I'm gonna hang out with him a lot b/f I go to Maine. 

Anyway, I'm gonna go do some stuff now, so see ya later!!"

"event","Ever had one of those days where you think it's gonna be awesome and then everything just goes SPLAT, and the whole day ends up sucking hard core? Well, today was one of those days...

My damn alarm goes off at 8 am so I can get my ass to the gym. I contemplate laying in bed until maybe 8:30 and then going to the gym then, but I just say to myself, ""Nah, just get up and get the day going. It will make your day a lot better."" WRONG. I get up and it's pouring outside so I'm walking to the gym without any umbrella or anything. I get there and it's fucking cold as hell b/c the air conditioner is full blast and I ma soaked. So I just tell myself to suck it up and get on the damn treadmill. So I do. I go for 15 minutes and it sucks cuz I am a lil out of shape but it's nothing too terrible. But then... I get on the eliptical and after 10 minutes I feel like I am going to puke. So then I'm pissed off cuz I can't finish my workout cuz I'm all shaky and shit so I leave. And it's still raing of course!

Anyway, then we go to the bank before class to deposit Denise's check so we can get our money in for our apartment. Unfortunately they won't let her cash the one check we need so they make her deposit it and then they say that they are going to hold all but $100 for a few days. WTF? They always do that shit. Long story short... we can't that stuff in today which means we have to wait and I am really stressed that we may not get it in in time to get a place for next year, b/c I leave in 12 days. I might be homeless! :-( J/J, we'll figure something out. It just worries me.

So I also have to write a 6 page paper thats due on Wednesday and a ten page one that's due on Friday. Yup. I am royally screwed! 

But there were a few good things that happened today:
1) I saw a squirrel who was laying on top of one of those stone benches on campus who was spread out on his stomach like he was tanning. I think he was retarded.
2) Denise found one of our quotes that we had written down when we were stoned and I apparently said to her, ""Oh, we'll get a hot and spicy. Even if I have to pop a tire!"" I was like what the hell did I say that for? Then I said that if I was stoned right now I would probably understand the wisdom in that thought.

That's all the good that happened today, sadly. Pretty pathetic~ a tanning squirrel and a stoned quotes, but hey, I'll take what I can get. Well, anyway,  better get to those papers so I don't fail all of my classes!

Quotes of the day or whatever: ""When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, ""Why god? Why me?"" and the thundering voice of God answered, ""There's just something about you that pisses me off."" ~Stephen King.  I think this applies for today quite well. :-)"

"event","Well, I had a nice, relaxing weekend at the grandparents. We went on a walk down this boardwalk thing this morning and I saw like eight baby alligators, I wish D could have seen them. But, I have a pic for her so yay. The boardwalk was kind of pissing me off though because it had all these fucking spider webs that reached all the way across and attached to you as you walked. I felt really gross and then just in the middle of my complaining, I was bitten by a mosquito! Yeah, that pissed me off. When we got back we ate Easter dinner which was yummy, and we had strawberry shortcake for dessert.

Now I am about to make the long one hour drive back to Borlando ad back to the fucking depressing dorms. Only two weeks till I get to go home and see my cute puppy and my family :-). 

Anyway, more tomorrow after I'm sure some type of drama has occured. Hehe. I wish I had something to smoke right about now. But this weekend should kick ass! Less Than Jake on Thursday and then Daytona and being fucked up the rest of the weekend beofr efinals week starts. Oh yeah, tomorrow we are gonna get our apartmet and stuff which will be cool. I'll put up a link for it tomorrow. 

Well... see ya soon stupid Orlando!"

"event","Okay, so everything below is from yesterday b/c I changed my username b/c let's just face it: my old one totally made no sense and also kinda sucked. Anyway, here it is:

Well, let's just say today is not a good day. My eyes are all sore and puffy from crying last night. Denise was mad at me and I was really wasted so I kept on crying and crying until I finally just passed out. I am going to my grandparent's this weekend for Easter and what not and as soon as I am no longer drunk from last night, I shall drive up there. Hopefully I can go really soon. It's always really relaxing there and I always leave very happy. Hopefully Denise isn't mad at me anymore because crying sucks and it also sucks when your friend is mad at you. 

As a side note... Amber is a huge bitch. If you don't know who Amber is, CONGRATULATIONS. She is one of the meanest, and also most psycho people I have ever met. I'm not saying I'm not mildly psychotic but this bitch is CRAZY! If you ever meet her, turn around and run. You'll know she's coming when you feel the ground shaking, and the sky turns dark grey and it looks like the end of the world. If you meet her, don't look her in the eye b/c she may turn you into and ugly little monster just like herself. You may think I'm joking or possibly even being a little dramatic about this, but that is simply not true. She is a bitch and she deserves to get hit by a dump truck and then buried at the landfill. Do ya'll have landfills in Florida? Well probably, where else would all of the trash go? Anyway, she needs to go to hell asap.

Okay, so Less Than Jake is April 15 at the Social and it's free for UCF students so anyone who wants to smoke a little weed with us and have a fun time, just let me know.

Well, I am off. Have a wonderful day everyone!

I'll leave you with this...

""We wouldn't be here if it weren't for psychedelic drugs. In terms of the role of psilocybin in human evolution on the grasslands of Africa, people not on drugs were behind the curve. The fact is that, in terms of human evolution, people not on psychedelics are not fully human. They've fallen to a lower state, where they're easily programmed, boundary defined, obsessed by sexual possessiveness which is transferred into fetishism and object obsession. We don't want too many citizens asking where the power and the money really goes. Informed by psychedelics, people might stop saluting.

Usually I leave myself logged in at all times so that I can check my friends page and my page quickly and not have to log in each time to see protected entries. For the last two days I've had to log in each time!! I AM changing the log-in to ""never"" on the log-in page, just so you know!!

Grrr... my belly hates me with a passion. It's been hurting me for about two weeks EVERY SINGLE time I eat. It doesnt matter what I have, it hurts regardless. I can't take it anymore! 

Kevin and I didnt wake up until after noon today. We stayed up late last night to put the tree up. He was suppose to get us a new and bigger tree from his grandma's house... too bad the one is brought is even smaller than the one we had last year!! We can't even fit as many ornaments as last year on this one!! I really am sick of small trees in general. I want a big tree... a more life-size realistic size tree, damn it!! We'll have to check the sales after Christmas and see if we can buy a tree for cheap in the size we want! 

After we got a lil more awake, I took a shower and attempted to blow-dry my hair the same way Diane (my hairdresser) did yesterday. It turned out great, and it took me half the time it used to take me to do it! We headed to Old Navy after that because I needed a brown t-shirt to wear under my Thanksgiving sweater. I had gone shopping with Trina last night and got a new coral sweater for Thanksgiving and a new black one with removable black and white striped collar and cuffs... they are both really cute! 

After Old Navy we went to Wendy's and grabbed the 99cent menu for lunch. I already feel sick and I just got done eating like 10 mins ago! Gahh!! I guess there isnt much I can do about it, except just deal. Kevin is sick again too, another cold. I swear every time the weather changes he gets super sick. I feel sooo bad for him!! 
He starts his new job in less than a week... I can hardly believe it!

I got my pics back from trying on dresses. I like the origninal dress on me the best in the pics. My mom liked the second one on me better in person. Trina liked the first. I guess I'll have to post them in the wedding_plans community and get some opinions. I'll let you guys know when I do so you can check them out, if you want. 

I think thats all for now... Nicole, call me later. If my tummy isn't acting up I'll go with you if you want the company. TTYL, all!"

"event","""I'm so glad to see I amuse you and your friends.

And yes, you ARE a poser. You front alllll the time, claiming someone else's ideas as your own. You're not as popular as you think, and just because you're into a lot of 'trendy' things doesn't make you trendy yourself. You're so determined to be friends with everyone and to have everyone like you and not be mad at you for various things, but it just makes you look so desperate. It's your decision to work somewhere not close-by and it's your decision to live with your fiance, so it's also your decision how available you make yourself to your friends. ""We should hang out sometime! Oh, but I can only do something on Wednesday between 8-10pm and Sunday mornings this week because I have to work, but.. I'd rather not on Sunday morning because that's the only time I get to sleep in,"" etc. If we are truly your friends you will make time for us, no matter what it involves switching around. And maybe you would have more of us if you actually called us once in a while. Don't call us to necessarily DO something, even. Call us just to talk, just because.""


I'm pretty much SURE I know who wrote it. And the fact that its even bothering me is pissing me off, at myself!! I just guess that my thought is that I hope my friends don't REALLY feel this way about me!!

I don't EVER claim anyone else's ideas as mine... I give credit where credit's due. I don't even know what thats in reference to. 

I don't think I'm popular, and NEVER have. I wasn't popular in HS, and I'm not now. I knew a LOT of people, thats not saying that I'm friends with a LOT... friends and acquaintances are VERY different things! I've also never claimed to be trendy... if any of my friends KNOW me they know I'm not, and thats the reason I didnt take the job at Aldo a long time ago because it's a very trendy place and it's not ME. 

I don't try to be friends with everyone... my philosophy is that people like me or they dont. I don't feel like having to pretend to be something I'm not to someone/anyone to make them like me. I've never, ever been that way. My mother would curse you out if she read that. She knows I dont give two shits what ANYONE else thinks of me...I don't ask people to be my friends- I'm friends with people who have respect for me, and vice versa. 

Yes, it is my decision where I work. It's my decision that I live with Kevin. I have NO regrets about ANY choices I've made in MY life. My real friends know that I'm busy, and that I do the best to see everyone. I've never been a person to call people ""just to talk""... I hate talking on the phone, its just not ME. I DO make time for the people and things that are important to me... and if you were ANYONE in my life you would know that ""make time for the things that are important"" is my MOTTO. 

Grrr... I don't know why I let that get to me, I guess I just always feel the need to explain myself when people call me out like that!! I'm leaving the comments open for this too... If anyone else agrees here, please comment. I'd like to know if this is how my friends REALLY think of me!! Sooo... tell me."

"event","Hey guys! I've spent most of the week just looking at wedding stuff and getting more ideas. I have sooo much figured out already. I'm really proud of myself that I am being organized and coming up with all these ideas. :)

Favors decided...tenative guest list made...decided where to register...figured out tenative budget with mom and dad...invites choosen- going to get sample and see IN person. I feel soooo accomplished!

My friends have all been really great and super supportive in helping me with ideas, offering things they've used, and offering ideas. Thanks soooo much, guys!! 

I have my wedding party picked and mostly asked. *Edit* Kevin changed his mind, so I have two more people to talk to. This makes me feel better! :) * I have one more person to talk to. I think the fact that I got engaged makes me see people for who they really are. I had to take into account the amount of responsiblity this will be, as well as financial, emotional, and physical work for all the people included. It's my wedding, I want the people who are a part of it to be 100% behind me, 100% of the time. I also can't pick everyone and say, OK... let's have 15 people stand up for us on both sides. Kevin has a LOT of really great guy friends, but he had to make a decision. It's not easy, so before anyone gets angry, remember that and remember that you'll think the same things and feel the SAME way when YOU get married!!

Mom and I are going to look at the dress I like on Sunday, as well as get a haircut and have a girls night with Diane (my hairdresser) and Opal (my second mom and my mom's best friend). I think I'm going to chop the hair and get the cute little layers that flip out when you dry it. I need a change, and I want something cute and stylish. I also know that if I cut it now then it'll have plenty of time to grow for the wedding so I can have a pretty updo with my long hair. I think I'll look for some ideas tonight as far as pictures go. Diane likes to see pics, it helps her a lot because I'm rather picky and particular and she hates to hear me whine after she cuts it, because she knows I will!! Haha.

I also have a whole packet of work to do for my online class. I got lazy this weekend/week with the engagement and just didnt do any work. Haha.  

Tuesday Kevin and I are going to Twelve Oaks to go shopping some more. We hated Frankenmuth this year. It was extremly busy, crowded, and it rained. I ran into Rob while I was there. He was with Nic. It was nice to SEE him. He hadn't seen my post about being engaged and when I introduced Kevin to Nic as my fiance he didnt say anything. I kinda was hurt, and confused as to why he didnt say ANYTHING. It turns out it was a misunderstanding and I know that he would never have let me walk away without saying something had he realized what I had said!! 

I can't wait to get my ring back. I just want to have it, see it, wear it, show it off. Grrr. They said Friday night after 6. Well, Kevin will be at work and only his name is on the slip! So, I wanted him to go Sat and get it and then I can have it after work. Well, my mom says I should go WITH him to get it so I can make sure its right incase it's not. It damn well better be!! I'll cry if it still doesnt fit! Trina and Tom are the only ones who have seen it so far... thats only because Kev took it over to show them when he first bought it!! 

I want to go look at the reception site this weekend/next week sometime too. Mom says we should sneak in! It's not like we couldn't... its a hotel and all! 

K, I have probably bored you with the wedding talk enough. I'm off to take a shower and work on HW. Peace ya'll."

"event","1) Kevin got a new job!!! Wahhh Hooo!! Human Resources from Vehma should be calling him Tues-Wed of next week to set up a physical and drug screening. He should be able to put his two weeks in after that! :) He says he wants to stay at CS for now and work the weekends. At his new job he will be doing protocols for new cars- they make parts for the Big 3. It's a very good job, with lots of room for advancement, AND really, really good benefits. Nice. 

2) My bank sucks. I put $2 of gas in my car the other day. I had $1.85 left. But, today my check goes through. So, it says my avaiable balance is $***.** but my current balance is -30.15 and they charged me a $30 fee. I don't see HOW that's possible if my available is HUNDREDS of dollars!! GRRRR!! They get me sooo mad! I refuse to pay their stupid fees, there is plenty of money in my account to cover 15 fricken cents!!!!! Gahhhh

3) I have to go back to work tomorrow. I had basically all this week off because of my back. I worked Sunday half a day, called in Monday and went to the Dr. Tuesday I was off for school. Wed I had a meeting at Great Lakes Crossing from 10-2:30 and then I had Thursday off for school, too. Today was my scheduled day off. So, Tomorrow its back to work, 1-10. Then all day Sunday. We have a staff meeting for Holiday and a Floorset. I work Monday 1-10, Tuesday 5-10 after school, Wednesaday 8-5, Thursday I am off for school, then Friday 9-6 and have the weekend off. Friday night I am going to a Stampin' Up party at Trina's mom's that she and her sister, Tami, are throwing. We are going to Frankenmuth on Saturday- and I am really hoping that Kevin asks me to marry him by the mouse with the cheese at the Cheese Haus. Haha. Don't worry- it's only a joke!! Sunday I plan on being lazy and watching some Football. Yippee. I feel like I havent worked in a month, and really- I havent. It sucked this week because even though I like being off I don't like being in pain!!

Alrighty, I am out of here. I gotta clean this place up and take care of Kevin- who is really, really sick. He says he feels like he did when he had pneumonia a few years back, that's sooo not cool. He took yesterday off, but he feels worse today! Poor thing! Lata all."

Today I spent some of Kevin's money. It was fun- as always. We bought a ton of soap from Bath and Body Works and I used my coupons. Saving money is fun, too. We seem to run out of the stuff really quickly because we have it in the kitchen and bathroom- we should be stocked for a while now. Yah!!

Other than that- we are about to put up our christmas icicle lights because its so damn nice today. We don't like to do it in the cold- and it's not like we plan on lighting them for a while, just want to get it done!! 

We looked at fabric to re-do the dining room chairs today too. The line was hella long. I also dont know how much fabric I would really need. Maybe someone smart with this could tell me... Andi?? I know their measurements, and I know we have to get it a lil longer to compensate for width and enough material to staple the undeside. Hrrrmmm. I just can't wait to do them. 

I'm out, peace."

It's funny that she did because they even have a sign in the room that tells you how much money you'll save if you DON'T smoke depending on how many packs you smoke a day. I should have stolen it to give to some of my dear friends *coughNicoleCassiecough* Haha. I still love you- I just want you to LIVE!!! Haha. 

Sooo... my doc tells me that he believes it's torn ligiments. He says I could have done this a long time ago and the reason it hurt bad on Friday was that my nerves are mad because they didn't have anything to attach too anymore. He gave me some back med's and showed me all these really cool excersises to do to keep it from hurting. He said once I heel he wants me to do Yoga. I will do what he says- but I picture myself doing Yoga, and I laugh. Ha. I am so damn uncoordinated- it will be a sight to be seen, thats for sure. I already asked my mom for some tapes for Christmas. He also told me that sitting is the worst thing I can do. He told me to lay in the fetal position as much as possible for the next few days... it's a damn good thing I liked crawling up like a baby to sleep, besides the fact that I look sooo damn cute doing it. Hehe :P He said if it still hurts, come back. He doubts its my kidney's because it's low, and he doesnt seem to think it's a UTI, which means I drank a lot of cranberry juice this weekend for nothing. Haha.

Thanks to everyone who was so sweet to me this weekend- I'm glad to know what it is, and hope to be in tip/top shape soon! Thanks again ya'll. 

I just sighed and I smell like Kevin... he just left and I miss him already. Damn I'm going to be bored tonight. Maybe I'll work on some more PowerPoint, since I love it so!!

At 9:30.

I'm... excited?!

I guess I just want to feel better- and as much as I hate the Dr. I like the thought of getting some kind of relief from this horrendous pain that I have been in. 

I worked on my computer class HW last night- I had to do a powerpoint presentation about myself. It was fun. I wish I would have chossen to do something in the computer field. Oh well. 

Also, Katrina brought me over some Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby after going to Meijer with Tommy. She is always thinking of me- she's such a good friend. I feel lucky to have met her and to get to live so close to her and see her all the time. She surprised me by bringing it over- it was just sooo sweet. :) It really put a smile on my face- and of course the ice cream made me feel better... Haha. 

Oh... I took vicodin last night and took a nap. When I woke up, my back still hurt. Yah- that's how much pain I am in. Fun, fun. 

Im off to take a shower and go to the Dr's.

For the past few weeks my lower back has been extremly sore... intermitten pain that almost puts me to point of tears. Today it came and never left. I was crying at one point and have been contemplating going to the hospital. I have a lot of symptoms of kidney stones- and I remember my dad having them, and how bad his back hurt that he could barely walk. This is how I feel. I also have been having really strange numbness coming and going in my hands/feet/fingers/toes for several months. This is one of the symptoms. I also have been waking up several nights this week in a sweat. Yeah- that's one too. And- tiredness/weakness and nausea. Yeah.

You enjoy your sexuality and teasing others with your bountiful sexual endowments.<br>
Whether it be your hot, hot body that is just dying to be taken in as many orifices as possible, or your sexually charged personality...<br>
Most are unwilling or unable to pass you by. <br>
<br>
They have no self-control once you unleash those primal sexual wiles on them.<br>
And they have no choice but to resist and cry for mommy.<br>
<br>
Your ideal career would be that of a porn star, because then everyone (with dick firmly in hand) could celebrate your sex drive.<br>
And you could lose yourself to all the carnal pleasures you've ever wanted.<br>
A sex kitten you shall remain!!

LOL... Yeah, right! 


I'm suppose to be on my way to class... I just hate school. i decided to withdrawl from this class. I just dont care- and my GPA will only suffer some more. I can't handle working fulltime and going to school full-time. I have to do it, but I hate it. Grrrr. 

Kevin has an interview at Vehma- It's a factory that makes parts for the car company's. His friend Tom works there, so he's got a really good lead. I really, really hope he gets this job. This would mean great things for us and for our future. It would also mean happiness for Kevin in the work department. He's hated his job for sometime now, and he deserves to be treated good. He's a hard worker and needs to be rewarded for that... He would be at Vehma- w/ overtime :) Yippee!! 

I guess that's all thats going on. I'm off to iron Kev's outfit for his interview and then work on my online computer class- I absolutely LOVE this class and I'm learning sooo much!! :)"

"event","The weekend was overall a wonderful experience!!

Friday: 
I spent the whole morning in the kitchen. I cut veggies for our family birthday's parties, which were on Sat, as well as for MY party later Sat night. I had spent ALL day Thursday making this place spotless- so when I messed up the kitchen I was no a happy camper!!I ended up dropping a bag of cheddar cheese on the floor, and ruining my cupcakes by adding 1 1/2 cups water- which was 1 cup too much. *sigh*

Kev worked til 3 and came home, took a shower and we got National Coney Island Carryout for dinner. It was really, really good! we left at 5:30 to head the Wings game. We got there early and each got a drink- it was my first time drinking at a game- WahhHooo! We watched the first period and then headed up to the Suites. We always go up to visit Kev's mom and aunt- they work there. We waited for them for about 10 minutes and then followed then around and talked to them for a while. Then we heard that someone got a goal- the suites go nuts and it gets sooo loud!! Kev was mad that we missed the first one and he wanted to head back down. Then, we got another one- and this time Stevie Y got it, and he's Kev's favorite- so yeah, he was disappointed we missed that one too. We finally headed back down to our seat and saw most of the third period- and Kevin got to see Yzerman get another goal- so he was content. We left about 5 mins to the end, Kev went to the bathroom and then we headed to the parking garage. We actually made it home in good time, and stopped at Meijer. I wanted to get more cupcake mix so I could fix those and some pop and what not for the party. I realized why I hate Meijer so much- yet again. You can't ever find anything, and it's soooo trashy- everything is in boxes on the shelves. It's like they are too fucking lazy to just take it out of the box like a NORMAL grocery store. I swore to Kevin that I will personally NEVER go grocery shopping there again!! 

We cam home and I unloaded and wanted to make my dip for the veggies and the cupcakes. Then I realized that I didnt have enough eggs for the cupcakes. I was pissed. Soo.. I opened the Mudslide mix I bought to have a drink, spilled that all over the place and basically started having a nervous breakdown. I cried and Kevin was wonderful. He told me to take my magazine to the room and lay down- and he took care of my mess and made my dip for me. I'm so happy that he is so understanding and that he will do anything in his power to take care of me, and make me feel better. I'm so glad I found a wonderful guy like him!! :)

Saturday: 
We got up at 9:30 and I got into the shower and my mom met me here at about 11. Tim stayed here with Kevin- because my dad decided to be a jerk and not go. My mom and I headed out and met my aunt Tina at the club house in my cousins tralier park ( *rolls eyes*- I know, I know) and waited for my cousin's fiance to bring us the key to get set up. We spent the day setting up tables, food, all that jazz in the culb house. Everyone was suppose to be there at about 5, and then my grandpa and uncle- who's from Kentucky- were coming at 5:30-6 and we were surprising EACH of them. Theire b-day's are in Dec, but this was a surprise party for both and they each though it was for the other! Haha. We are sooo sneaky. Sooo.. I got to see everyone for about 45 minutes, ate, and then we had to head home. 

We made it back here at about 8 and Kevin went to get ice. I made cookies- that my mom had gotten earlier from Meijer when we ran there out in Oxford to get ice and posterbaord to make signs. I got everything all set up and Trina and Tom were the first ones here. They were going to go to a Haunted Forrest, but it was raining so they decided not to. Matt was next to get here, and then Jimmy. Everyone who we thought was going to come did. :) I got to see Julie, which was really, really nice. It had been a long time. Laura came but wasnt feeling the best. She's still in pain from her surgery, and I don't blame her. Steve came and brought Jason Clancy- who we hadnt seen in a long time, either. I got to see Nicole and Ray, and Cassie and Josh. I got to meet Jim's new g/f when she came after she got off of work. She's really, really nice, and he seems to like her a lot. They were so cute just cuddling together and they were some of the last ones to leave. I think it went really well... Kev and Ray did a few songs and Kevin's voice wasnt the best from all the drinking. Later that night I found him sleeping next to the toliet and had to put him to bed. He told me that he remembered nothing after Nicole and Ray left. Ha. 

After everyone left I stayed up and cleaned the apartment a bit and then headed to bed and watched Big Daddy because I was wide awake! I finally feel asleep at about 2:30, which would have really been 3:30. 

Sunday: 
Got woken up to Garth Brooks music at 9am. I was NOT a happy camper!! I grabbed the swiffer and banged the ceiling and then Dr. Dick decided to pound on the floor. I was sooo mad. He left shortly after that and I watched him walk outside and he stuck his middle finger up as he rubbed the back of his head. I swear I wanted to run after him and kick his ass. We couldnt go back to sleep so we got up and watched some TV and then decided to take a shower. We took a nap after that and then woke up and had lunch and rushed to get ready. WE made it to Nicole's just before 3 and stayed until a little after 6pm. Chandler's party was nice- it was good to see everyone again. I also got to see Hannah for the first time and I got to play with Chandler. That kid is sooo full of energy!! When we left, we called Tom and Katrina to see if they wanted to watch a movie. They said that they had to take showers and then they would call us. So, right before they called I found out that Kevin has been doing something that really, really upset me. They called and then were over within 2 seconds. I was pissed because I didnt get a chance to talk to him about it, and I didnt want to deal with people being over at that moment. My apartment was perfect yet, because we had been talking a little RIGHT before they called. He asked them to leave and I stayed in the bedroom for a while by myself. He came in and we talked about it, and then we decided to scrapbook some pics and just hang out here. 

The whole weekend was pretty good, and busy. I can't believe that my vacation is already over today!! :( I don't want to ever go back to work. Haha. 

I also start my online class today- so I am going to log on and then clean up this place some more. Talk to everyone later!"

"event","Soo... Yesterday I spent the entire day cleaning the apartment, getting it ready for tomorrow's festivities. :) 

If anyone needs directions- it's not all that hard to find, but mapquest doesn't exactly tell you where to turn- let me know. I can e-mail them, IM them,  or call you. 

We have about 15 people coming for SURE and about 20-25 including the maybe's. Yippee!!! :) I love having people over and last year was sooo fun! The party we had after the party-lite party was fun too! 

So... after I cleaned everything I made Kevin dinner- Spaghetti. I have never made REAL spaghetti- I knew how, I'm just too damn lazy most of the time. It turned out really good, Kevin ate his whole plate, and half of mine. LOL. He also told me it tasted like his mom's- and it's one of his fav foods. So, that was a good thing. We ate at the dinner table- which is rare- and I had candlelight and everything. :) 

After dinner we snuggled and talked about the wedding. I am almost POSITIVE that he's going to ask me before the end of the year. Thats what he hopes, and so do I. We talk about the wedding EVERY day and get more in depth with each conversation. His eyes light up when I show him things I've found online- and he kisses my forehead when I get excited about silly things like ring pillows in my theme! Hehe. 

I have told him that what's most important is my being able to tell everyone that we're engaged, and plan to spend the rest of our lives together. I don't care so much about a ring... but he really wants to do things the right way- and I love that he loves me with all he has and that he wants to make the proposal PERFECT!! He's such a wonderful man- I am very, very lucky. I know a lot of people who think their relationship are wonderful- and then they move in together and realize that they had NO idea about what a REAL relationship takes. A lot of times its too late, because they're married already. I'm glad that we made the decision to live together- for many reasons. I know for SURE that Kevin will make a wonderful husband and a good father- someday. He always helps with the housework, cooks when I need him too, cleans up after himself, runs errands- even grocery shopping!! More importantly, he doesnt let me stress about money. Even when things aren't coming together he makes it work. He has sooo many excellent qualities. He is quite the catch and I couldnt ask for a better guy!! 

I wasn't sure if I was going to let anyone read this entry- aside from me. I guess I feel like my guy friends, in particular, have never given Kevin a chance. They refuse to come to my house or hang out with me if Kevin is here. That really hurts me. I want them to know how happy he makes me, and how incredible our relationship is. I think other people judge me because <i>I've</i> started planning a wedding and we aren't engaged. We'll FYI- Kevin has made every decision WITH me. This isn't MY wedding, it's OUR wedding. We felt that we would need 2+ yrs to plan everything and have the things we wanted. We could have waited to plan it until after we got engaged, but then we wouldn't be getting married when we wanted because of having to push it back- or we would end up rushing it, being stressed, or it being held someplace crappy because thats all that was available. I think that some people have NO idea about how long it really takes to plan a wedding, or the amount of work goes into it. grr... Okay, that's the end of my rant. 

I guess my point is that I want everyone to just be happy that I'M happy- that seems to be too much to ask from some of my friends. This makes me wonder then why I give them that priveleged title...."

Yesterday I spent the whole morning and afternoon with my mom. We got all my little girl cousins purses with initials on them. After that we went to lunch at Olga's and then went to look around at another store. My mom found some Christmas gift's for Kevin, so she snatched them up. She's already almost done with her shopping- she's out of control! 

After that we headed to Lakeside Mall because she wanted to use a coupon she had for Limited. She got a cute halter top and the free shirt from the coupon. We proceeded to look around for a black cardigan- we looked at EVERY woman's store in the mall and found NOTHING!! No one has any simple black cardigan's. It was crazy. So we couldn't find what we wanted and decided to leave the mall and go to the fruit market. 

Mom loaded up on fruit and veggies for them and got me all set for the veggie tray I have to make for our family party this Saturday. I drove us back here and she went home and Kevin and I got ready for dinner with the kids. 

We went and picked Tim up and then went and got Mary I and Brendan. Dinner was really good except for Brendan finding a piece of plexi glass in his first pizza and then getting it taken off the bill and getting another one, and then finding a piece of hair in THAT one. Yuck. I was so disappointed. That's our favorite place and we've NEVER had ANY problems, let alone something like THAT! They gave him a free dessert too. I still feel bad, though. 

After dinner we took the kiddies home and came back here. We called Tom and Trina because we made plans to watch a movie with them and they were still out. Alan had called me to do something- but I was already busy. Oh well... I don't think I'll get to see him this time, but maybe next time he's home. 

We waited for Tom and Trina and then Jenny called me!! :) It was soooo good to hear from her. She and Aaliyah are coming out in March to visit her brother, Steve. He gets back from his Mission then, so he's coming back and she's coming out. I plan to see her then, and the baby. I can't wait!! I am going to call her again this week to chat some more. I miss her a LOT and it's nice to have someone to talk to that knows me sooo well and understands me completely. I love that girl! 

We ended up going to Tom and Trina's and watched Halloween 2. I havent ever seen any of them, but it was pretty good! We came home and headed to bed. We didnt get up til 11:30 today... it was really nice!! I feel guilty sleeping in- but man does it feel good!!! :) 

I am out... gotta see my boy off to work! TTYL!"

That's all I will say about that... Oh, except for- my wonderful mommy got me silk calla lilies- that look incredibly REAL and a BIG vase to put them in!! :) She does love me dearly! :) It really made my day!!

I spent some time with Laura yesterday, going to Target and the Dollar Store. Didn't buy much, just Halloween candy for the party...?? Is there going to be a party?? No one seems to want to answer me or Kevin. I may say fuck it all. I don't want to deal with all the crap of putting it together and no one showing up. Bah. 

I'm glad I could take Laura out for a while. I hope I made her feel better. Being in the hospital and at home all alone day in and day out is no fun for anyone!!

After that I went to Mom's and dad made us steak for dinner. YUM!! I love my parents' cooking- I had really forgotten that. *sigh* We went over to the neighbors and saw a new baby!! My neighbors are this really old couple, and their granddaughter just had her third baby. Her first is 12, then a 2 year old, and now the new baby. They are all such precious kids. The 2 year old is named Grace. Awww, how sweet. The new baby is soooo pretty!! Her name is Jenny Bug. Hehe. I love babies. Someday, someday. Then we went back to mom's and worked on Tim's scrapbook. 

Today mom and I are going to my work to get some gifts for my cousins. We have a family Christmas Party each year and my mom always feels the need to get the kids something WAY cute- even though we draw names anyways!! She cracks me up. She's got enthusiasm and she loves kids... what can I say?!

Yeah... I have issues with women because I don't tend to like females as friends. Just my close nit set of girls, and thats IT. I don't really understand the others. 

I'm in a real shitty mood tonight. Don't ask me why. I wont discuss it. 

I am off to update my TO DO list and then head to bed. Maybe sleep will make it better. Ehh, I doubt that."

I just don't get you."

"event","Dan, this one's for YOU!!

A long, long time ago I used to talk to guys online. I wanted to meet someone worth my time, and I dated- a LOT. 

I liked meeting guys from OU best. I was only a lowly Freshman then, and I needed more friends that went to the same college as me!!

I had an ad on love@aol and a friendly guy named Dan wrote me. We IMed a few times and decided to meet one day in the OC on campus. This wasnt the first person I had met this way, or the last. Kevin and I were actually friends at this time, and Dave and I were ""dating"". I never dated only one guy at once because then that wouldnt be dating! That'd mean they were my b/f and at this point not a single one was worth that title to me!!

I remember Dan turning the corner and I knew him because of pictures. he smiled and came over and acted all sweet and geeky and unsure of what to say. It was funny and kind of uncomfortable at the same time. Needless to say- it didnt feel right. My friends, Meggan and Joe, said that he wasnt my type and although he e-mailed me after that I didn't write back. 

I hope I didnt break his poor little heart. It's funny now three years later looking back and knowing that the same person I've met on LJ in a community for OU kids is the same sweet guy I met on a blind-""date"". Hehe. 

I am sure you dont remember this... my screen name was different then, I look different now, and I've known you've had an LJ for some time. There is a girl that I dislike. She has friends on her friends list whose journals I have read. Then, I read their friends. I guess sometimes you get bored and read a lot. I came across this girl who had this b/f, Dan. I read further and saw it was YOU!! I recognized your screen name and looked further and saw your pic and knew I was right. Ironic really. Does that make me a stalker?? Haha. Maybe, but you had NO idea- I must have been good :P 

The end. 

P.S. I have added Dan to my friends list, and a girl named Ang who I love. You should check them both out. They are cool- like me. :P"

"event","Sometimes I feel like life just isn't fair. Yeah... it's not news to anyone or anything. I just always thought that my life would be different, and it's all been a pretty big dispointment. I feel like I've failed as a human. I have been handed so many chances and ruined them or ignored them entirely. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me! Sometimes I can't believe that I've even made it this far in life. I put on a pretty smile and a kind demeanor a lot of the time when all I want to do is SCREAM because I can't stand things going on around me. 

Change the things you can and accept those you can't. Accepting sometimes is the hardest part. Yep. This hurts me more than you'll ever know. Sad thing is, I can't change this, control it, and I damn well wont accept it. 

I had this whole big plan about my life... I don't know where that went. I guess sometimes you throw it out the window. I wish I wouldn't have. I wish I knew then what I know now. Hindsight sucks. 

I know I'm rambling and I know no one will understand this. The only two people I want to talk to are 1)thousands of miles away 2) Don't even know I think of them so often... That's sad too. Damn, I can really be depressing."

<marquee> Happy Birthday, Julie!!!!</marquee>

Sorry it's one day late... I was thinking of you all day, I just never was here to update and I'm not cool so I don't know how to make those e-cards! Hope it was all you dreamed it would be, and more! :) 


Secondly... I have a wonderful boyfriend! Kevin came home the other night and surprised me with The Lion King on DVD. I LOVE the Lion King... it's my all-time FAV Disney movie. I had to watch it like 20 times senior year in Spanish- and I know the whole thing in Spanish because of that. It's just a great movie and I never get sick of it!! I'm really into all those songs too.. call me a lame-o. But, I can't help it. I just like them. I mean, come on now, you all know my fav movie, The King and I, is a musical!! Haha. I am an old, old lady inside this sexy 21 yr. old body! LOL. 

Speaking of that. I lost another 2 pounds! :) Yippee dippee!! :) 

Alright, I'm out! Later all."

"event","I wanted to tell everyone how happy I am about my ""diet"". Kevin and I have decided to change our way of life (WOL) in terms of eating and we started following the Atkins Plan. I have tried this before, as you guys know. I have lost weight and felt like 100% better by doing this. I want more than anything to not be sick anymore!! This WOL makes me feel great- more energy, I sleep better, I'm not hungry all the time. It's fabulous. Besides that I just wanted to let everyone know how much progress we've made so far. Today is only day 4 and I HATE weighing myself all the time, but I am a sucker for seeing results. 

Kevin:   Down 6 pounds!!!
Kristin: Down 4 pounds!! 

Yah!! I love this sooo much. Best of all?? Kevin's eating veggies!!! He ate a bed of lettuce under taco meat the other day and then today he ate broccoli!! I know people have issues with the Atkins Diet, but please understand that we have researched this througholy and I feel that this is best choice for US. I actually eat more veggies and healthier foods when I am on the ""diet"". I think that once we get used to eating more veggies and are not so dependent on take-out and carb-ladden food, we'll go off the diet and just continue to eat healthy and make smart carb choices. :)

I've said I was going to do this before, but this time is sooo different!!! :)"

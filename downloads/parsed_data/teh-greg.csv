On a high note, I went to cake this weekend.  if you werent there then you missed out, it was a riot.  aden came home with one less shoe than he left home with, meaning he returned with three.  thanks to elliot for all the help on getting us home safely..  

Halloween party tonight which should be spectacular, we will update with further details on that tomorrow evening.  don't count on that, its been weeks since my last update.    but if you wanna come and you know ryan b than give me a call, i've been forbidden from putting any more numbers up on this page since the ""disaster"", more commonly known as the masterpiece of my creating of jimmys party."

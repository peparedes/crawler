"event","Florida was awesome. Hurricane Alberto came and went, and didn't do much. My room was absolutley hilarious: Shara McClanahan, Katie Kenealy, and Katie Trautman , Sarah Fitzgerald and Me. We had the best time.&nbsp; The beach was gorgeous, but I was scared of being eaten by a giant shark.&nbsp; I think that one of the reasons that I loved this trip was being one of the oldest ones, and all of the older people on the trip were girls.&nbsp; It was a great girl bonding trip and Im excited to get back and keep up the friendships we had all gotten to busy for.&nbsp; Also I would like to say &nbsp;that Brad Reekers can rap the whole baby got back song really fast. And that Dane is a horrible go fish player.&nbsp;(because he beat me like a bajillion times)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am re-energized about what I am supposed to do with my life. I had let that fade away, and now I feel ready to do it.&nbsp; I also realized that I have been asking people around me to change when I have done nothing to change myself to fit who I am and who I am becoming.

"event","Back from AZ. it was fun,.. I ofically have one day to go to school, then one day of finals, then one more day of finals. I can' t even contain myself right now.&nbsp; Josh picked me up from the airport that was nice:)&nbsp; even though i slept (drooled? maybe?) on the way home.&nbsp; I am going to cut my hair short this weekend. I want to go to a new hair place though, because last time I was in there&nbsp;1) it was 90$.&nbsp; 2)the guy i thought was gay wasn't gay. 3) my hairstylist just recently developed a case of bad breath, and sometimes gets these deoderant marks all over that bug me for some reason.&nbsp; Any ideas?!&nbsp;

i have a lot to do these next few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;
life is really happy right now and comfortable.&nbsp; Sometimes being comfortable is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

mackenzie is a chipppppppmunk. or was. that made me laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


uhm, Arizona was gorgeous.&nbsp; I decided that the only thing i don't like is having to drive five bajillion hours to get somewhere. ASU campus was sweet.&nbsp; I really like cacti (as in more than one cactus) ((i think thats right)).&nbsp;&nbsp;


summer is so close.&nbsp; ....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..... .... .... ... .. .. .. . .&nbsp;

"event","sometimes something happens in your life that is a defining moment. sometimes you can't escape feelings no matter how hard you try to run from them. only, although i run in circles, i never arrive at the right time, or the right place. and now, that meeting place has disappeared completely. there's only the pavement my feet slap over and over because despite everything, i still can't stop searching for it. i can't accept that it's gone. 

but this time is different. instead of vanishing, i saw it explode. i saw the windows burst and the flames lick the roof. i stood there too scared to put it out, too scared that i couldn't do enough to stop the flames from spreading. so i poured what little water i could on the mess before me and walked away. i was too afraid the fire would take me with it, but i should have known it would put itself out the minute i averted my eyes.

the ruins that lie in its place are painful to look at. someone is building a new house there, on that very spot that burned so brightly in front of me not so very long ago. a family is moving in soon. love will douse its walls with colors and with memories. and i'll keep running past it. my feet don't remember any other asphalt."

"event","i leave for the beach on saturday. and i'll be gone a whole week. a whole freaking week. i never go on vacations so i'm just a LITTLE bit too excited about this one, i think. 

rented beach house
sleeps 8
2 friends
extended family
my boyfriend being there for a bit
=
exactly what i need.

i checked the weather yesterday and it's supposed to rain there all week. fucking great. but you know, i think the beach will be just as awesome with or without 7 days of sunshine. it just better let up long enough for me to get tan.



OH! and if you haven't seen Wall-E then you're crazy. it's the best movie i've seen in a long long time. definitely my favorite animated movie ever. but i can hardly bring myself to even call it animated. it is so much more. it's brilliant.

"event","at the begining of the summer i started writing my book. it's the most nerve-wracking process ever, but also the most gratifying. i've been pre-writing and planning for the past year, writing down ideas that came to me whenever and wherever they struck, so actually sitting down and composing the words feels amazing. i've got a few chapters down and so far...it's coming together better than i could have imagined. sounding incredibly corny, it's almost as fun as if i was reading it written by another author. i just hope my stroke of imagination holds until i can get this written. it's scary. 


otherwise, life could not be better. honestly. i wrote a poem about it. i'm lame, i know. but i've been waiting for life to be fun for a while now. about fuckin time! 

i also think i've been drinking a lot. go figure. luckily it's mostly beer. i'm off vodka for a long while."

"event","i was feeling nostalgic, so i came to read some good ol' livejournal entries. i don't feel so bad, seems like everyone's given up on writing in here. and my last few entries, from a year ago or so were all me bitching and complaining about my job. well i quit. and it feels amazing. i should have done it so much sooner, but i think i waited til the right time. i don't miss it at all and i think if i had quit sooner, while everything was relatively peachy, i would have regretted it. but now, i don't desire to set a foot into that store. 

i guess you could say i've done some major trimming to my life. i've gotten rid of all the negative influences that for the past few years have served as barriers holding me back from being both happy and from living my life. i'm sad it took me this long to realize just what i was doing to myself, but i guess everything happens for a reason. it just sucks to think about all the things that i lost or gave up on while i was waiting to finally set myself free, however, i couldn't be happier now and i have people around me who are amazing influences and who really care. so god bless america."

i really wish i could find some kind of desk job or something that would be weekdays, where i could sit, and where i would get off at like 6pm. not that plato's is hard work...haha its definitely far from it, but working til 9 leaves me little time for much else, and i'd like to have a life again.

i never write in this thing anymore. i keep saying that. and it appears like nobody else really writes in it either...oh well, i guess everyone grows up eventually, but i sure miss the days when we'd all write about the crazy night before and laugh about the funny things that happened. those were good times. no one i know knows how to party anymore. i miss drinking beer with friends and music. 

other than school and work though, things are really really good. for the first time in forever everything is working out and im finally feeling like im normal and on-track...whatever track that may be. things are so different now, and im so glad i finally have someone to share it with who is just as weird as me. haha cause im definitely kinda different.

anyways, i need a new job. i cannot handle working at platos anymore. its the easiest/best job i've ever had and i HATE that i need to leave, but it has gotten to the point that i cant and wont deal with the petty bullshit that goes on there. for pete sake, there are only 6 employees, yet SO MUCH fuckshit. i wrote a note to my manager about days i cant work once this semester starts and was it read by ryan? nope, instead it got read by everyone else and THROWN away. i've worked there longer than the 2 people in question and certainly do much much much more than the both of them for the store, but they seem to think that because they WANT 40 hours a week and i do not, they are above me, and therefore deserve their choice of days off over me.too bad once school starts sunday will be the only ONE day a week that i have nothing to do. so sue me.

in even more exciting news, i dont think ive ever felt so betrayed by someone in my entire life. she can go to hell for all i care. honestly, its so sad to me to see people who are just angry you have drifted apart, take it into their own hands and attempt to fuck up your life. it isnt working and it just makes you look like a loser who has nothing better to do than talk about someone else. we graduated 2 years ago. start acting like it.

speaking of jobs, starting monday for 4 weeks, i will have 2 jobs. and im not looking forward to it. i do that summer camp counseling every summer and hey, its good money so i might as well do it again, right? well except that i have to be there mon-fri at 9am-2pm then 4 days during mon-fri head straight over to good ol' platos to be at work there by 3. kill me now? not to mention little children just plain tucker me out.

and lastly, ive figured out that i could move out possibly within about 4-5 months. which would be absolutely kickass. of course, thats all depending on the fact that i will be working as much during the school year as i am now. but still, that is a very comforting fact. i need my own place. me and kristin are going to live together most likely somewhere off busbee (basically the only place around) except that i found these AWESOME loft apts in canton, ga that are freakin cheap as hell but also nice as hell. only problem is whoever gets the loft doesnt have much privacy...but yeah, moving out = FINALLY."

"event","i use livejournal less and less. i guess thats kind of a common trend though...remember when we'd make 2 or 3 posts a day? just complaining about some new bullshit in our lives?

the bullshit still remains, but i guess we've grown up enough to not have to bitch about it every time. 


ive been working a lot. i got a raise, again, which is awesome. i love my job. i know theres nothing overly awesome about it, but i actually dont dread going in to work, even when im hungover/tired/sad/not feeling well. and to me, that is worth its weight in gold.

i feel like i NEVER see anyone anymore. so this is a list of people that need to contact me. bc it is a crying shame that it has been this long. what happened to the good times??

"event","you know what? i really hate that every guy i meet is only interested in ""hooking up"". i dont have a problem with the concept, and am not opposed to ""getting some"" or whatever you wanna call it, but honestly, why the fuck cant i find a decent boy who actually is interested in dating me, spending time with me, and just being a decent human being in general. maybe my problem is that ive totally fucked up anything like that that has ever come my way. great. karma is a bitch.


i might only be saying because im drunk. but i really miss nice guys. i miss having someone who actually likes me for me. god dammit."

"event","lately, ive been having the most terrible dreams. the kind where you know exactly what it is your subconscious is trying to reveal to you, yet you dont want to listen or believe it. and i hate them. theyre so real that when i wake up im so positive that the events actually happened, im actually sad and visably upset. what the hell. 


and its not feeling like summer to me yet. maybe thats cause i work so damn much, but still. its not as warm as it should be (especially at night) and people arent hanging out like they did last year. im sure it will pick up, but right now it kinda feels like every other day of the year :("

When you try your best but you don't succeed 
When you get what you want but not what you need 
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep 
Stuck in reverse 

When the tears come streaming down your face 
when you lose something you can't replace 
when you love some one but it goes to waste 
could it be worse? 

Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try to fix you 

well high up above or down below 
When you were too in love to let it go 
But if you never try you'll never know 
Just what you're worth 

Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try to fix you 

Tears stream down your face 
When you lose something you cannot replace 
Tears stream down your face 
And I 


will try and fix you"

"event","the braves game was one of the best experiences of my life. so much fucking fun. i hadnt been to one in years, and although the game itself was pretty mundane...not a lot of action, i had a blast. but perhaps it was beforehand that made the night. 


oh yes, that was it ;)"

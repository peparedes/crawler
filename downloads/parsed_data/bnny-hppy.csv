HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS 

""Silver Bullet""

Tonight, we fly away so high.
Our first full moon sky.

I'll breathe you in,
I won't let you down,
I won't hold your back,
I won't make a sound.

I know what scared you the most.

Being Alone,
Just like them,
Being Alive,
Feeling so... DEAD.

At least you'll have my... HEART.
You know you shine so bright.

Got a single Silver Bullet
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can survive,
Without you.
Got a single Silver Bullet,
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can survive,
Without you.

Can you sleep at night,
If I hold you tight.
I won't let you go,
This feels so right.

Please don't leave this... TIME.

At least you'll have my... HEART.
You know you shine so bright.

Got a single Silver Bullet
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can survive,
Without you.
Got a single Silver Bullet,
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can survive,
Without you.

Tonight, we fly away so high,
Tonight, We fly away.
You know the moon is full and,
I can't live without you.

Tonight we'll fly away
(Got a single silver bullet, shot right through my heart)
Tonight we'll fly, tonight...

Got a single Silver Bullet
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can survive,
Without you.
Got a single Silver Bullet,
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can survive.

Got a single Silver Bullet
(Tonight we'll fly away so high)
Shot right through my heart.
(Like a full moon sky)
To prove I can survive,
Without you.

Got a single Silver Bullet,
(Tonight we'll fly away so high)
Shot right through my heart.
(Like a full moon sky)
To prove I can survive,
Without you."

"event","Friends...
It's hard to believe it's time to go
Leave this way of life, spread our wings and grow
Say goodbye to those friends that we hold dear to our hearts
Shedding tears for we'll be so far apart
Remembering all the good times and even the bad
Including the fights we sometimes had
Through the tears and the pain
Friendship was our gain
We stuck together through sunshine and rain, laughs and shouts
We found out what true friends were all about
So as the year comes to an end
We'll carry in our hearts our special friends
And take with us all the memories that were made
Since that very first August day."

""Miss You""

I'm out here on my own
Feeling lost and all alone
I'm mad that you were gone
All my friends are moving on

[Chorus]
I'll miss you forever
I'll miss you always
Good bye is so hard
But I'll say it anyway
The silence after
this disaster
Can't keep my laughter from healing all my pain

This story's getting old
This dusty picture's growing mould
I feel trapped inside this place
If only one last time 
Just you and I 
Could stand here face to face

[Chorus]
I'll miss you forever
I'll miss you always
Good bye is so hard
But I'll say it anyway
The silence after
this disaster
Can't keep my laughter from healing all my pain

Time stands still
Every time
You come to mind
Just like
It did that day 
when you chose to walk away

[Chorus]
I'll miss you forever
I'll miss you always
Good bye is so hard
But I'll say it anyway

I'll miss you forever
I'll miss you always
Good bye is so hard
But I'll say it anyway
I'll say it anyway
I'll say it anyway
I'll say it anyway

I'll miss you always"

Friday: I was supposed to go to McDonalds to give them my application but then my mom said something to me and I got mad at she didnt wanna take mecause I called her a stupid ass(but I kno if it was Jennifer she wouldve still taken her)so I didnt go and havent so I guess Im not getting that job...Whatever...They dont wanna get it through their heads that if I got the job I wouldve been helping them w/ money...but hey like I said WHATEVER!!!!Anyways so I didnt do anything else...I went to bed and woke up and it was Saturday:)

Saturday:I woke up at 9:00 and we had to take our dogs to Clark Park cause they were giving free shots for dogs and cats...then I went home and did nothing again...I talked to Lorena...then she had to go cause her sister was crying in the store then I called Bea...and we talked for a little bit...then I went to bed I think...
 
Sunday: I didnt do anything either...Dont you guys enjoy reading about my boring life...Oh yea Im just wondering WHY DO PARENTS EXPECT THEIR KIDS TO BE EXACLY LIKE THEM??? We were all outside and my dad was working on my uncles car...cause hes a mechanic and shit and then he started getting mad and saying all we can do is argue and we should be helping him more outside and we werent even arguing...He expects us to wanna do the same thing he does...like we're supposed to kno what the hell to do..but we dont and we dont want to...so again whatever...:)Anyways that was my weekend...and now its Monday and Im tired,hungry and bored out of my mind...BUH BYE...
     Oh yeah and I just thought Id say Im miserable...and I need a man..lol...Ive been alone too long...:(

""A Thousand Miles""

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever 
Think of me

'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your
Precious memories

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
Tonight

And I, I
Don't want to let you know
I, I
Drown in your memory
I, I
Don't want to let this go
I, I
Don't....

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder....

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you...

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could 
Just see you
If I could 
Just hold you
Tonight"

*|Broken Hearted|*
   Green Day
""Basket Case"" 

Do you have the time
to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything
all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or I'm just stoned

I went to a shrink 
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause
it's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh, yuh, yuh, ya

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or I'm just stoned"

"event","omg i think im gonna die. It has to be 90 degrees! Or maybe its like 80..I dunno. I dont know if its me but ever since it started getting hot i cant really sleep that well. 

OOh lemme write about the concert. It was so much fun! At first i didnt even think i was going to go because Moms were having mad PMS or something. But then my mom said she would take us so we went, Not knowing for a fact Zac's mom would pick us up. We finally got their and our seats were so damn close (front row). We got to sit next to these 2 really hot girls so that was fun hehe. The opening act was rowdy, But everyone else was hating on her. Then Jc came out to perform. When he would come out our section, he would basically stand right over me, I was praying his sweat wouldnt drop on me cause that would just be fucking nasty. Then when the show was over we sat in this nice shopping center and waited for zacs mom to get us. 4 people asked us for a liter, I told Zac and Mira that we should charge people a quarter then we would of made a dollar! lol.

The night was basically perfect, It would of been a little better of someone would pay me for the ticket, But i dont think i'll be getting that money anytime soon. Oh well.

Well Idol is about to start, and yeah dont have that much to talk about. Later."

"event","i seriously suck at updating this thing. I always say i am But i never do. Oh well its not like nothing ever happens with me anyways accept mine and Mira's lame jokes :)
<br>
Well right now i am a tad pissed. I just found out from *someone* that *someone else* thinks something of me and i feel awful about it. No names because im not allowed to start anything (thats something new for me ;)) It really upsets me when people are straight forward with me. I wish people would just say whats on their mind and not go behind peoples back.
<br>
Well my weekend sucks already and it hasnt even started. I was supossed to go see my Mira but were not allowed. that sucks big time because i have been looking forward to it since the begining of April, Now my dreams are crushed :( I was supossed to see my Dawn but not no more, Maybe it just wanted meant to be. And then once those planes got canceled i got new ones to go out on Saturday, But thats not happening now because of *someone*. Maybe i could just work around the house and make some money since im only down to $110.00 when i should have $200.00 *PAUSE* remind me later to tell mira to rush with my money, i kinda need it now lol *OK*
<br> From now on when i say PAUSE its from Saved by the Bell, when zac talks to the camera. Its a little inside joke me and Mira have, and Yes we know were lame and were proud of it because were both some Qute Boo's !
<br>
Ok well thats it for now..hey this was kinda fun. maybe i'll start updating more *PAUSE* Maybe Not..*Ok"" lmao"

"event","Oh golly goodness! I am so tired but i cant sleep! I went to bed basically around 2 and didnt fall asleep till about 4:30. Then i had to wake up around 7 to get my sister up. Now im blasting some Sarah to keep my up *does a little dance*
<br>
Last night went by so fast. For some reason my mom didnt end up getting home till about 7 - 7:30, she also brought some subway home. I ate a whole hoggie with the matter of 5 minutes. I wasnt letting nothing get between me and my hoggie! Then i watched a little bit of tv then Terry came over so i went upstairs and fell asleep till 11. Maybe thats why i couldnt sleep. hmm. Today is Wednesday so that means only 3 more days till the Bing Bing ! (if you dont know what the bing bing stands for all i can say is..ONLY MONKS CAN KNOW) rotflmao. Speaking about the bing bing, zac is sick. I swear of the Son of a gun is sick for the bing bing, Lordy watch out now!
<br>
Ok well thats it for now, To tired. But before I go i shall tell you all a nice Joke.
<br>
Ok..their was a boy riding his bike down the street, Why did he fall off?  Cause someone through a refrigorator at him ! LMAO.. If you dont find it funny, keep saying it over in your head lol."

"event","wowza it has been a long time since i updated in this joint. Right now i just wanna hurt someone. Not in the greatest mood. Eek! Im starting to get a fucking headach. Right now im listening to the phone ring..and ring...and ring. Iv learned now not even to look at the caller ID when someone calls because we all know who it is. Something funny just happened. My grandma (terry's mom) who i havent talked to in like 4 years just called and left a message saying ""Barb, when you get home have jason call me"" WTF !?! why the fuck would i wanna call that old sack of bones! The bitch didnt send me a easter card nor a Valentines card, But she sent katie one.
<br>
*looks for ciggaretts* And my mother wonders why i smoke? This family is fucking nuts! people leaving damn messages saying their gonna fucking ruion holidays and kill each other. We can only hope that gay ass bastard movesd to flordia, But like i told mira, Im sure he will still find a way to ruion our lives from their.
<br>
Once again another weekend at home. well eyah friday was lame because i was with someone who was probally undressing me with their eyes, and no i dont mean my boo Linda ;) The ""bing bing"" night is most likely not happening. Why should i be used for a house when certain people can go out with other certain people and do the same thing? In ways im deffinitly feeling used by both parties, But oh well..Whats new right? Both bitches! I sure miss the days when i was friends with danielle and heather, even tho they both drove me nuts it was fun. 
<br>
not to long till the jc concert! I am having mixed feelings about it. I dont think mira even wants to go and well i have to figure out some sort of deal for zac to get him his ticket. and if the bastard cant even pay for half cause he rather waste his life on weed, well then i'll just find someone else to go. *looks for lighter* Ok well you know what time it is."

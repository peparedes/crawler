"event","Wellll...lets see. Long time since I've written in here because I've been incredibly busy and it seems as if after school activities are taking over my life. Whatever..I'm having fun doing it all, and that's all that counts..right??

Saturday- After spending the night at Amy's..Amerz and Kris came over and we hungout at my house. We watched You Got Served and Malibu's Most Wanted. I hafta admit that after watching it all I had an urge to be gansta..crazy. Then, us 3 went to softball practice and I left right after to go to Parker's bar mitzvah. Fun funn! PARKER YOUR BAND KICKS ASS <3

Sunday- Went up to Orange County to visit my cousin because it was her birthday. I was up there pretty much all day, but had to come home to go to volleyball. Wowww..first fun practice in a LONGGGG time. :-O Yeah, I know..soo amazing.

I've come up with good/bad things about my life..
GOOD-
1. I couldn't be on a better softball team
2. Doing good in school
3. Love my volleyball girls
4. Kayla makes me really happy
5. Supporting friends
((sounds good??))..not quite.
BAD-
1. Kayla's moving.
2. Not as great of friends as I used to be with some people
3. Kayla's moving.
4. English (and school in general) is a tourture chamber..you don't even understand.
5. Kayla's moving.
6. </3 i love him </3
7. oh..and did I mention that KAYLA'S MOVING?!

Holy motherrr. Kayla I can't even explain to you how much I'm going to miss you. You're my best friend in the entire world and I know things are always going to be that way..but I just can't imagine you so far away. :-/ Even thinking about it makes me wanna scream. I'm hoping things work out for the better..and you stay. I love you."

"event","Thursday- wowwww wow wow. Alexa, Tatiana, Kaylynn, Kiersten, Laura, Maureen and Elizabeth..funnnn stuff. We all ditched practice and went to the talent show and saw a band play. Alexa and Tot are in love with them. And of course, every action has a consequence..so we all got in major trouble by Jed. Yeah and even after the hour of running he made us do, we would totally do that again. Haaha love you girls.

Friday (today)- Lunch=boring as hell. I think I should just fall asleep during that 40 minutes or whatever it is..I really don't care. Later tonight I'm spending the night at Amy's house with Kristen! hoorayy! Maybe going to the TPHS volleyball game too, don't know yet though. Kayla hope you have fun today..I know how much you're looking forward to 7:00! hah. <3"

"event","MONDAY: Pretty short day..which is always good. When I got home I talked on the phone with JOE MCLAUGHLIN AND ERIN REINHARDT <333 Joey I miss you to death and Erin you're the greatest..sorry about everything. That was just a whole load of misunderstood crap. Then I went to my softball game which we should have won but I rather not talk about it considering how depressed I was after we lost. Went to bed extremely content with life for the first time in a while.

TUESDAY: Got into deep trouble in math..but that's just an everyday problem. After school me and Catherine walked to the Rec Center for softball practice then left early to go to our CVMS basketball team party. I love you girls!! 14-0 champs.

I know there's something wrong with my life..but as of right now, everythings okay. <3"

I talked to alot of people and some pretty crazy crap happened with someone and it's incredibly stupid and I'm completely over it but I doubt she is. But whatever I don't care at ALL because she doesn't understand. WHATEVER, I MEAN..WHY WASTE YER TIME ON SOMETHING SO UNIMPORTANT?? Exactly my point. But yeah I did nothing the whole day until 2:00 when Elizabeth finally came home from her team party at a gorgeous house in Rancho Santa Fe, of course. Later on, Kristen and Lauren came over and we had some pretty good times talking about *stuff*..that you don't need to know, let's just leave it at that. <3

Kristen Elizabeth Filicia..you are amazing. We are two CRAZY kids and I seriously cannot imagine life without you. I love how no matter what we always end up laughing til we cry. You're the best. <333

Friday and Saturday for example..Friday I had a softball game vs. Erin, Catherine, Wendy, Paige, DanaB, etc etc..we won :) After that I went to Laura's house and we went to the PAC to go swimming and play basketball with Isabelle and other people. Saturday I had a volleyball tournament in Poway, then a softball game which we should have won bcuz we were ahead 7-1 until it all fell apart and we lost by 1.  After we had our ""team party"" which I wouldn't even call a party. Then I had ALLSTAR PRACTICE with my other softball team. WICKED SURF, HECKA SLOW--LOL KRISTEN THAT WAS HILLLLARRRIOUUUUS!! Finally, me and Kristen went out to dinner at Red Robin, then came back to my house and watched Bringing Down the House and the very beginning of Honey. GOOOOD weekend so far :) <33333"

Monday math testing went horrible..lunch has been extremely boring..we lost our softball game and I pitched horrible..i miss so many people it's crazy (Catherine, Joe, Morgan, Aimee just to name a few)..and I played horrible in my basketball game..and those are just starters. I feel like my worlds been turned upside down and it's trying to shake me flat-out off this planet. Why must everyone be so full of themselves, shallow and fake? What is it that motivates everyone to be like that?? I love my softball people--Kristen, Chelsea, Catherine, Paige, Alyssa, Jenny, Madeleine, Sydney, Amy, Corey. You all are so full of life and pure..I can't even explain how much I love being around you all because I know that none of you give a crap what anyone thinks about you. Doesn't get much better than you ten. Kayla I love you too because you're always yourself and your so upfront with everything and I know that peer pressure doesn't bend you. Love that.

Alrighty well Saturday I went to Laura's house and that was a nightmare (literally haha) I swear ghosts are haunting that house!! Then I went to my softball game up in La Costa with Madeleine and we've played the best we've played in a long time. I had 12 strike outs..which I'm pretty proud of. We got a double play to Steph, Chels then me at first. NICE. Oh and I got a double, walk and single with Jacquelyn's fabulous bat (I've officially given up on mine!) AND me and Chelsea threw someone out at 2nd. SWEEET..nice game ladies. After that I went to Red Robin with Chelsea, Madeleine and Natalie. When I got home Kayla called at like 11:30 and we talked for 95 minutes (it says on my phone). Sunday was Mother's Day (lol Kristen). I went out to lunch with the family then went shopping with my mom and we we're supposed to see 13 going on 30 but they were sold out. :-/ Anyways, after that I went back home and my grandma and grandpa came down from San Clemete (GREATEST PLACE EVERRR!!) and we all went out to dinner.

Cath I miss you to death babe you've taught me everything I need to know in life, and because of you I will never take anything for granted ever again. It's been really hard without you and I wish this never happened, but I'm just so thankful that I was fortunate enough to meet you..you've truely changed my life forever. I love you with all my heart and I'll never forget you. #7forlife.

As you can probably guess today's been really hard to cope with. Luckily, the tears only occured in the morning BEFORE school so I wouldn't be embarrassed in front of everyone. Besides for that, everyone you made my day great. It's amazing how even on my roughest days, you guys can always make me smile. I love you all for that. I'm all psyced because today I have a softball game vs. Tamsyn and Kristen's playing up for us! (Chelsea I'm gonna miss youuu!!) Then I'm going to Souplantation with my All-Star team (THE GREATEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD..I LOVE THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING) and we're having like a team get together/dinner. It's gonna be sooo much fun I can't wait. Who knows what I'll do after that..probably having a sleepover with Kris or summin. yah well comment if you know what it is losers. :) <3"

But me, Morgan, Brooke, Savana, Kara, Kaitlyn, Corinne, Megan and some other people are really really super cool because we sat under a tree while other people suffered in the blazzing sun. HA HA LOSERS!!! After school I had basketball practice and we scrimaged the 8th graders..it was fun I guess..but it would have been a bazillion times better if Kayla was there. Kay I missed you!! HALF DAY TOMORROW!! HALLALEWYA ALMIGHTY. <3"

"event","Wow. Another grrrreat day! Slept in til like 9:30!..and that is EXTREMELY late for me. Went to Jamba Juice then went to Kristen's softball game. That was fun..I love Kris she's the best. Then I went to La Costa (in the 90 degree weather) for my game, we tied, and had the worst umpire everrrr! omg I can't even explain how fcking hilarious this guy was..he didn't know any of the rules and he was this jerky little midget that's like 60 and I bet never married..much less KISSED. Sydney THANK YOU SO MUCH for knocking over his coke..that seriously was the highlight of my day! After that I went home, got showered n all that stuff..and went to the movies with Kristen and saw Envy..horrrible movie!!!! Don't go I'm telling you its BAD. Then we went to Coldstone and Kristen got a kids cup and they gave her 1/4 of a scoop of ice cream..it was great. Comment <3"

"event","Today was the greatest day I've had in an extremely longg time. MORGAN TUREK I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!! I'm always here for you babe! After school I went to Laura's house with Alex and we blew up a Tennis ball with WD-40 and a ton of matches..SO AWESOME. Then we hungout at the Highlands for a while and later went back to Laura's (DRUNK MOTHERS! HAHA!) We stayed there until 7:30 but then went back to the movies at 7:30 to see Mean Girls with Morgan, Savana, Kimbo, Corinne, Brooke, Kara and Kaitlin. Great movie..Alex- Jump and Giggle! ahhah! Oh and Laura and Alex decided that I was the perfect clone of Karen, yes the BLONDE in Mean Girls, because of the part when shes putting on the rhine stone ""K"" on her chest looking into the mirror and ends up putting it on backwards. Oh and of course because she has ESPN (something I could so picture myself saying..) and lastly, because she can tell that theres a 30% chance of rain with her boobs...when its raining. Thanks guys, I love you too. :) After that we went down to Rite Aid and got kick ass ice cream for 99 cents..I swear thats the best deal ever. Fun nighttt! <3

KAYLA SUZANNE GOD I MISS YOU N LOVE YOU AND ITS SERIOUSLY HELL WHEN YER GROUNDED!! BFFFFEEEE

MORGAN TUREK <3333 MUCH LOVE YER THE GREATEST."

"event","I swear there is nothing important or worth while to talk about in my life. Each day just comes and goes like nothing new. Sad, but true. Okay well accually science was good..Michael Dymytryks hair behind his ears and to the side, believe me its blinding. English was more than desent today..FINALLY!! Alexa and Laura I love you two to death our conversations are always intertaining. P.E..fab as always with my #1 bffe! Then me, Shaina, Alex, Laura and Kimbo went to Jamba Juice after school...now I'm home. FINALLY. Nothing to do!! But accually I'm going to Laura's house and we're going to light a tennis ball on fire which is going to be the sickest thing ever, being the pyros that we are :)

"event","Alrighty..trying out this Live Journal deal. No doubt mine will suck, being the computer amature that I am..but it's all good. Okay well today was the best day I've had in a while. In the morning I went over the Shelby's house then we went to the torture chaimber also known as school. Lunch was fun I guess..sat with Alex Moran, Alisha, and Alex Bernarnini (isolated from every other fag at our school) because they're just the coolest people ever! 5th period math kicked ass as always..elizabeth, cam, carissa, john, david, becca, nick, laura, alexia, claire, kevin..you guys are the best! Ugh, after school I had a basketball game vs. DNO (Aimee!! i love you babe!) and hung out with Morgan the entire time because we are just too cool for everything. Nice job today Bobcats. Then got Panda (Laura I know yer jealous..no hiding it) but yes..anyways..7-something weeks of school left! God I can't wait to get out of this hell-zone formally known as school. And spend time with people I care about over the summer without having to deal with all the lame ass drama that goes through CV. I wanna get away."

"event","Ok so im back from my 2week holiday and im pretty motivated and ready to change my life around but at the same time im kinda depressed.  Im depressed because of how fat ive let myself become.  But im really happy because ive taken control again and im ready to be PERFECT.  Not just weight but also at everything else.  Im going to work out 6days a week and onsume 400kcal each day.  Iv divised a point system that i have stuck on my wall so that i can keep track.  Im going to find a job.  Im not going to drink alcohol or smoke until summer (actually im not going to smoke EVER again).  Im going to tone every day so that i have abs to die for.  Im going to get a first class honours at university so that i can get in to Vet school and live the dream.  Im going to get shit ass skinny.  im going to look after my skin.  Im going to drink a ton of water because right now im hardly drinking any.  Finally, im going to keep my room ABSOLUTELY perfectly tidy...i get sick of it being a mess.

Here is my exercise plan:
Morning - 30 sit ups, 30 tricep dips
        - A gym class
Lunchtime - 30 sit ups, 30 tricep dips
          - 60mins on the treadmill
          - Ful circuit of weights
Evening - 40sit ups, 40 tricep dips

With regards to calorie intake im going to make sure that it is before the 60mins on the treadmill so that i can burn it off before its turned into fat.  I guess when i do eat, its going to have to be protein.  Im really looking forward to being perfect...i cant WAIT!"

"event","Its going so well but im just so unhappy.  I should be feeling on top of the world.  But im not.  Im feeling tired and sick.  Ive been doing so much exercise and eating next to nothing and iv only lost 1lb since Friday.  What is with that?  Im hoping its because im building up muscle mass but unfortunately i dont think your body can make muscle in three days.
I ran 3km on Friday (200kcal burned), 6km yesterday (in 45mins, 370kcal burned) and 7.5km today (in 55mins, 450kcal burned).  Iv been eating 500-600kcal a day.  Surely i should have lost SOMETHING.
The most scariest thing happened this evening...I made myself some carrot and corriander soup (150kcal for 300g) and i was really looking forward to some food.  But i started eating it and i just COULDNT eat it.  It was making me feel soooo sick, like i coulf ACTUALLY puke.  Thats never happened to me before.  I always have to fight the urge to eat and i have to TELL myself to stop.  Today, i just COULDNT eat it.  So i had like 5 mouthfulls max.  I mean its EXCELLENT that i dont have to fight the urge anymore but it was really scary at the same time, because im so tired and i NEEDED those calories...but my body just wouldnt take them.
I hope to god that i weigh less tomorrow...otherwise i may just get myself into a complete frenzy.  My housemate is COMPLETELY oblivious to my eating habits.  So thats GREAT.  She knows that i was starving alot before christmas and now she thinks im loosing weight in a sencible way.  She thinks im eating a normal amount and exercising...lol.  She is completely oblivious to the fact that im eating about 500kcal and burning off 400kcal of it.  So thats good that i dont have her on my back 24/7.
Im back home tomorrow so no exercise so im gonna allow myself 200kcal.  And then im off to France on Tuesday morning.  Im travelling with mum so im going to have to eat some kind of lunch and im not going to get out of dinner either but im going to try and just get away with a green salad.  Im gonna be skiing everyday with my parents so i may have to eat lunch (again, ill just have a green salad) and im going to ask if i can waitress at the hotel in the evenings so that i can get out of dinner.  If i cant do that then ill just have to choose the most low cal starter on the menu and pick at that.  I should be able to keep it under 400kcal a day.  Im going to be skiing everyday so hopefully will burn a few calories but it probably wont be that many.  Better than nothing.
So thats the plan for the next two weeks.  When i get back im going to get back to running 6days a week and eating a minimal amount.  That should get me in shape for the wedding at the end of February.  Then after the wedding im gonna be working towards my birthday and then the SUMMER HOLIDAYS.  I hate bikinis and skimpy clothing.  But im going to beat my lowest weight by then.

INTAKE
100g kidney beans = 100kcal
5 mouthfuls od soup = 50kcal

Cals burned = 450kcal

Not a bad day at all...its a shame i feel so god awful."

"event","So im in a great mood.  I had my gym induction today and it went really well.  I cant wait to get down there tomorrow morning!  The gym guy showed me how to use the tread mill and all the weight things.  I only ran 2miles and i know i can run a bit more than that.  So tomorrow im going to go for 3miles...maybe more.  My upper body stregth is terrible so i have to work on that.  So bye bye bingo wings!  I brned about 250kcal according to the treadmill which brings my intake all the way down to 200kcal...yay!
The great thing bout running is that it makes you sooooo happy and it just gives you so much energy for the rest of the day.  Plus, it stops you feeling hungry too which is an even better bonus!  Im already worrying about having to go on holiday and miss the running.  But ill be skiing everday with a bit of luck.
The gym instructor said i had a very good level of fitness and that im a good runner...so that made me pleased.  It seems like there is a good social atmosphere up there and stuff because there are lots of pictures on their walls of various social nights and stuff.
My housemate has entered into some healthy competition with me.  However, i am EXTREMELY competitive and i ALWAYS win!  lol.  But it gives me an incredible amount of motivation.  I think she is quite competitive too so it should be fun.  Its a race to see who can run 10miles first and then when we are running 10miles we are gonna see who can run it in the fastest time!  She also challenged me to a swimming contest too...but im not doing that untill iv lost some weight (there is no way im wearing a bikini looking like this!).  Iv also got to race my brother up the mountain in April so that is another goal.  And of course there is the weightloss goals.
So all in all im am in a wonderful, optimistic mood!

INTAKE
3 mini yogurts = 150kcal
2 slices of turkey = 100kcal
1 courgette = 40kcal
100g cabbage = 100kcal
50g kidney beans = 60kcal

SUB TOTAL = 450kcal

Calories burned - 250kcal

TOTAL-CALS BURNED = 200kcal

"event","Ok so today went kinda good, kinda bad.  The vegan thing was not washing with my Mum at all.  So i had to eat like a sandwich & dinner.  But i think i got around it as well as i could have done...

Breakfast - 1 apple, 1 orange = 100kcal
Lunch - Tuna sandwich with low fat mayo = 350kcal
Dinner - grilled cod and courgette = 250kcal
Snacks - yogurt = 100kcal

TOTAL = 800kcal

Then i ran 3miles which probably burned around 250kcal bringing the total intake down to 600kcal.

I know its pretty appalling really.  Not much self control involved.  I promise i will perform better.  I promise i will be more perfect tomorrow.  Im starting to get that control back that i had all those months ago.  Now ive got going again the ball will just keep rolling.
I really hope to be lower than 126lbs by the end of February.  Im going shopping tomorrow so that i can find some inspiration to get thin.  I want to look like those models i see in magazines.
Mum said i could do with loosing a few lbs...im so glad that she is honest with me.  But then she tries and shoves food in my face.  i really dont understand her sometimes.

Mum and Dad had a huge argument tonight.  Dad kicked a hole in the door and literally picked her up and threw her to the ground.  Mum smashed alot of things too.  I cried and i cried and i cried.  She tried to leave (i really think she was being serious) but i hid all the car keys and took the mobile phones.  But she packed her bags and everything.  I screamed and screamed for them to stop.  Now mum is sleeping in the spare room and that makes me sad.  I dont know if im going to be able to sleep tonight.
It was all my fault.  I was really selfish and pleaded to watch big brother...if i had just shut up.  If i had been a perfect daughter, none of that would have happened.  Mum wouldnt be hurt and Dad wouldnt be sleeping alone.  If i was just a bit tidier.  If i just made myself look a bit more pretty.  If i was a little bit more helpful.  If i was 20lbs lighter.  I would be perfect...and arguments would be avoided.  I need to stop irritating people and start realising what im doing to my parents relationship.

Monday tomorrow and only 7days to make myself look half presentable.  Im never going to be happy until im back at 126lbs again.  I cant believe i got so skinny and i threw it all away.  Why did i do that?  Im an embarrasment to everyone.  My parents are so disapointed in me.  No one is ever going to want me when im this big.  I want to go runnung but everytime i get up its so wet and cold outside.  Its all excuses.  I shouldnt be such a wimp.  Suck it in and get a grip.  Do you want to be miserable for the rest of your life?  Do you want him to like you?  Do you want to look emaciated at that wedding?  Then stop stuffing your cake hole!
Its not a difficult descision...no more food.  It might be tough, it might be painfull...but its completely worth it.  You have done it once...you sure as hell can do it again!  I need a buddy."

Im off back home today so im not going to be able to get away with fasting (probably a blessing in disguise sinse it always seems to leed 2 a binge).  So im going for te whole slimfast thing and then fish and salad for dinner.  That should bring my cal intake up to around 600kcal (ugh).  But im only going to do that until sunday.  Then ill stop eating the breakfast shake (-200kcal) until wednesday.  And then between thursday and saturday im going to restrict to 250kcal.  And then fast as long as possible.  Im praying to god that ill make it to at least 134lbs by the 17th.  Its not my lowest by any means but its better than what i am now.  I havnt weighed myself today due to the binge im just 2 petrified.  But when i weighed in yesterday i was weighing 144.4lbs.  Iv got 2 look at least halfway to skinny by the holiday otherwise stuart will never like me back.  Im going to do some running everyday as well...about 3-5miles, maybe even working up to 7miles.  I can only live in hope! lol.

Iv already consumed 300kcal today...so no lunch for me and a teeny weeny dinner.  I hate going home where there is a ton of food and questions.  aaahh!"

Im head over heals for this guy that ive known since i was like 2 years old and im seeing him again in two weeks time.  Thing is there is another girl on the scene and she is ten times prettier and half the size of me.  I know he likes me but i know who he is going to choose (thin is always better).  So i have to be under 126lbs by the 16th of January when i will be seeing him next.  I have no idea how much i weigh at the moment and to be honest i dont want to know.  When i get back to uni this afternoon i shall pop down to Argos and invest in some scales and publish the awful truth this evening.  Im fasting until the 16th and anyone is welcome to join me.
I shall post later with the whole guy story and my innermost feelings later this evening when i have nothing to do and feeling sorry for myself!  Im really not up for going back to uni and pretending to my friends that im in a great mood and nothing is wrong.  I think i might just lock myself in my room and only come out unless absolutely necessary.  I really dont care what they all think anyway.

But i just dont know what a normal amount of food is anymore...or an acceptable weight.  I want to ask people how many calories they consume in a day.  But they wouldnt know and i wouldnt want them to think im strange.  I want to know how much people weigh.  Just so i can get some sort of perspective back.  I still think im fat.  And i still feel like im getting bigger and bigger and could so easily stop geting bigger and bigger by restricting again.  But i keep telling myself that that is not the way to go.  I thought i had a hold of everythin until about 2 hours ago when Rhea started insensitively shouting her mouth off.
It was so triggering i could believe it.  I didnt know that something so small could make me decide that i didnt want to eat again.  She was talking about this girl she used to know and how she was properly anorexic and how she showed all the ""classical symptoms"" and how she went away one summer and came back stick thin.  I just wanted to be that again.  I felt so inspired when she said that.  I felt so proud of that girl she new.  And i remembered how happy i was when i was loosing.
The thing is, everyone keeps telling me that this eating will make me happier in the long run.  But i want to be happy NOW.  I want to be skinny NOW.  And i find myself getting fatter and fatter and feeling shitter and shitter and i dont really understand why im doing this to myself.  I dont fit into any of my clothes.  Thats TERRIBLE.  Im going to go into Christmas FAT.  Mum is going to buy me those skinny jeans and im not going to be able to fit into them!  HOLY SHIT what was i thinking?  Why am i doing this?  Thats it.  Iv got to go back to restricting.  I have to.  Im not happy.  Im going to loose a stone before christmas.  But i dont want to just binge over christmas.  NO. Self control.  I WILL be skinny.  I deserve to be skinny.  I dont deserve to be miserable and fat.
Today i ate 1700kcal.  That is unacceptable behaviour.  You fat lump of lard.  Keep it under 500kcal untill next Wednesday.  Then FAST until Friday.  And restrict to 300kcal until the christmas holidays.  End of.  No discussion."

Although i did look horrendous and i hate the fact that im gettin bigger and bigger.  Its scaring the shit out of me.  I had an argument with Rhea yesterday.  She is angry at me because i never have a good word to say about myself.  She said that i cant be perfect at everything.  Its it such a crime to try?  Here is what i ate today:

Breakfast: Porridge - 200kcal
Snack: 6 dried apricots, cereal bar - 200kcal
Lunch: Mini pizza, mince pie - 500kcal

It makes me want to cry.  But im not giving up on it yet.  Hopefully my weight will start to drop eventually once my body gets used to it.  If i dont feel any different by Monday week then im stopping all this healthy eating shit and going back to restricting.  Because i DO NOT want to carry on getting bigger and bigger and more and more miserable.

But its not like im underweight...in fact, the opposite.  Ive been at seriously low weights and i believe that i have had ""anorexia"" as it were.  But i know that i cant possibly say i have it now.  Its just that since i came to this uni i feel like its made me binge so much and ive put on tons of weight (i dont know how much because i havnt been on the scales for months).  So right now i think im more coe with fasting thrown in.  Its weird because right now i really dont fit into any category.  All i know is that i am very unhappy with my relationship with food and my weight issues.  Im not going out because i feel fat.  Im not wearing any nice clothes because i feel too fat.  I feel demotivated because im fat.  I feel like a complete failure because of it.  And im so petrified of getting even fatter.  So petrified that i have full blown panic attacks in the middle of the night.  I want to go to the counsellor and get help.  But i feel like she may laugh at me.  I dont think i really deserve recovery at this weight.
The thing is, is i went shopping and bought normal food.  And i have the intention to eat 1,500cals a day.  Which is a huge amount if im plannin on loosing weight (which i DO want to do...i DONT want to gain).  I know that if i eat that much that ill just get fatter.  But thats what people normally eat right?  And they dont put on weight do they.  So maybe i will loose weight.  I mean, i am prepared for the fact that its not going to be instant weightloss like when i restrict.  And im trying to come to terms with the fact that 1-2lbs a week is a perfectly substancial amount to loose and that i should be happy with that.
Unfortunately, im an all or nothing girl.  So im either binge eating CONSTANTLY or im fasting for weeks on end.  I cant do in between.  So right now i have bought all this food and i CANT stop eating it.  I want to get some kind of control back.  I have no control around food.  I just want to be stable.  I want to be happy with myself.  I know im not making any sense but i make sense to myself.
Im going to write what i eat each day to try and control what i eat.  For some reason if i have to write it down later, im less likely to eat it.

Breakfast - Porridge, 2 kiwi fruits 200kcal
Snack - cereal bar, clementine, Bannana 200kcal
Lunch - turkey and cheese sandwhich, cereal bar, apple, bannana, 2 oranges 600kcal
Dinner - Jacket potatoe with tuna, orange, apple 350kcal
Naughty snacks - cereal bar and a malt loaf 600kcal

TOTAL - 1950kcal!

See what i mean by an all or nothing girl.  There used to be a time (literally about 4 weeks ago) when i practically had to FORCE any kind of food down me.  So after all this food i just felt so scared and i couldnt breath because i realised that i was going to get sooo fat.  Im going to be obese.  And i dont feel like there is anything i can do to dtop it.
I want to get better.  I want to treat food like other people do.  I want to be slim and fit but in a healthy way.  I CANT gain anymore.  I want to go see the counsellor but im so embarrassed.  I really dont know what to do."

"event","OK.  Ive told my friend that im going to try and eat more healthily and stuff.  Obviously im not really but it should get her off my back.  It should be quite easy to fool this lot...it will turn the whole thing into quite a fun game.  OOOO I cant wait.  Ill just make all this amazing food and take it to my room and throw it away...how pathetically easy!  Ive got to find a dress for the UWE christmas ball so that i can have some kind of thinsperation and goal.  When i want to eat, all i have to do is think about how fat i will look in that dress.  So ive got two weeks to sort myself out for that.  Starvation central...here i come!"

"event","Ok so today has been alot better.  I woke up feeling quite crap.  Just a pounding headache really.  I didnt go swimming today either...maybe ill go in a bit.  But i feel like ive been quite productive rather than moping around all day.  Ive had one hotchocolate and a bowl of soup.  Ill probably have another hot chocolate so that will bring my total up to 250kcal for the day.  Ive decided that im not going to fast this week because it ony results in a binge.  Plus being able to eat a small amount makes so much difference to energy levels and stuff.  Im going to fast next week though and then ill go back to restricting the week after.  I really need to get back down to a size 10 again.  My housemate seems to have got off my case which is a GREAT thing.  I think im going to go swimming actually because i feel like ive been quite indulgent today and i need to burn some of it off.  It will make me feel alot better i think.  I was very proud of myself today because i went into Marks and Spencer and there was all this georgeous christmas food and i was so tempted to buy some and stuff my face but i didnt...yay me!  This weekend will be full of that kind of food because im going to my parents house.  Thats another reason why i dont want to fast this week because i really dont want to set myself up for a horrendous binge on the lovely food that i will be served.  If i dont deprive myself then i wont feel the need to go crazy at the weekend.  I really hope i manage to keep my wits about me and not binge.  I mean ill have to eat quite a bit because, well you no what its like with parents!  Im going to swim 40 lengths and im leaving in 10 minutes.  No EXCUSES!  Im glad life seems a bit better today.  See you later."

"event","She tried to talk to me.  She said that Anna was very worried about me.  I snapped at her and told her to quit sticking her nose in.  She said that everyone is asking how i am all the time, apparently i look pale and ill.  Thats such a pile of rubbish, i do NOT look pale at all.  I wish i did.  She said that everyone keeps asking her if im ok and that she is sick of it.  Not my problem!  I dont know why everyone is so bothered for god sake...its not like i matter.  I wish i could just get on with this without any hassel from everyone around me.  Why cant they just let me get on with it.  Its not like im wasting away because im huge!  If i were stick thin then maybe i could understand if people were getting concerned.  But im soooo FAT.  I just dont get it at all.  She doesnt understand at all and she never will.  I told her that she cant do anything about it and that she is just going to have to accept it.  She walked out.  She said that she had found a really good friend in me and doesnt like to see me do this.  I think she is being a drama queen.  There really is nothing to worry about.
Ive had 3 hot chocolates and a piece of Turkey.  So thats about 200kcal all in all.  Im not going to fast because it only leads to week long binges and im sick of that happening.  I need to stay in control because there is no way im failing this time.  Tomorrow im going to have soup for lunch.  Im only going to have one hot chocolate tomorrow.  I cant wait untill next weekend when i can go home.  I hate this god forsaken place.
Now i have to drive Rhea to this pub that she wants to get a job at.  She did it in a really devious way and now im pissed off because im literally going to drive her there, wait and then drive her back.  She says she cares about me but she doesnt mind taking the piss.
God im getting so dangerously depressed.  The whole thing is going to get way out of hand.  Maybe when i loose weight ill be alot happier.  Somehow i dont think that will happen.  Sigh.  I did a small amount of work today.  Other than that i have literally just moped around and cried a bit.  How joyous.  Im going to go into the xmas holidays fat and im sooooo scared."

"event","I dont know why i did it.  I havnt done it for so long.  But i hated myself so much that i had to.  It isnt anything serious.  Just one clean cut on my arm.  I can cover it up easily.  I thought id got passed all that.  I really hope i dont do it again.  It stings.  But i deserve it.  I just sat in my room all day crying and fefeling sorry for myself.  And then i got angry at myself.  Angry at my failures.  Angry at my fat ugly body and the fact that i let it get that way.  I hate this place.  Its ruined me.  There is so much food in my fridge and its going to go off.  Its a waste of alot of money.  I dont want to eat it but i dont want to throw it away either.  Everybody hates me.  I dont blame them.  I hate me too.  Im an idiot.  I dont know whether to say something to her or not.  If i do she might never want to speak to me again.  But im woried about her.  Im worried that she is going to do something stupid to herself.  But i dont think i can ever forgive her for what she did and what she wrote in her diary.  She hates me and i dont think there is much i can do about it.  If i say something she will know that i found her diary.  But she is the only person i have here.  If i loose her then i will have no one and the same thing will happen here as it did in London.  I dont know what to do.  Maybe she will talk to me first.  I think she should since she was the one that looked through my computer.  She has gone for a walk and i know that is something she does to stop her from doing other stuff.  Im never going to confide in anyone ever again because it ruins friendships.  And so many of mine have been ruined that way.  I hate myself more than ever before.  I cant believe i let myself get to this point of obesity.  Ive got to get my BMI lower than 17.  Maybe then i will be happy.  I hope so.  Maybe ill never be happy.  Because it seems that no matter how many times i try to make a success of life i ust become unhappy again.  I blame it on my situation and where i am but i think its just me.  I think im just incapable of being unhappy.  And i have no right to wallow in my owwn self pity.  There are people so much worse off than me.  There are people that have a REAL reason to be unhappy and they still put on a brave face.  But me...i dont even have a real reason and i go as far as to cut myself.  I really thought i was past that.  Now i cant go swimming.  I hate myself.  I hope i rot away from this hell.  I deserve a long slow and painful death.  Ill do it all by myself and no one can do anything about it."

Now she thinks im weird.  Now she hates me.  I didnt do anything to her.  She thinks i hate her.  She thinks im shallow and im not.  She thinks that im an idiot.  She said she cant even stand to be in the same room as me anymore.  She said she cant be bothered with me anymore.  Ive fucked it up.  Ive fucked up my second attempt at uni.  She thinks i want to be like this? I never asked for her to get involved.  I never asked her to get worried about me.  I dont need help from anyone.  I DONT NEED ANYONE!  I dont want anyone to think im not capable of looking after myself.  I am strong.  I can stand alone.  I dont need anyone anymore.  Ill reach my goals and kill myself all by myself.  I just hope it happens sooner rather than later.
She thinks that im viscious.  she thinks that i hate everyone.  And she thinks that i go out of my way to upset her.  Well im not going to say anything like that EVER again.  I dont need her.  She thinks that i need to talk to her.  Well i dont.  I can bottle it up.  Just like i did before.  Besides, its better that way.  It will give me something to focus on.  It will give me motivation to starve myself.  To rot from view.  To leave this fucked up place that they call life.
People think they can help and they stick their big noses in.  I told her because i trusted her and now she has given up on me.  Well ive got news for you...its happened before and i can cope with it.  She thought she could change me.  She thought she could take this away from me.  She said she would be there for me.  But then it got too much for her.   She realised that i couldnt be changed.  She couldnt force feed me with her lies of friendship.  But its ok for YOU isnt it.  Its ok for you because you can just DROP IT.  You can wash your hands of MY HELL.  But i cant.  And i never will.  And i DONT FUCKING want too.  And you will never understand that.  Well thats fine.  It works better when no one cares about you.  Because when people know they make you fat and they force feed you with what they call love.  But really its because they are JEALOUS of your self control.
FUCK YOU, IT and EVERYONE ELSE."

"event","I FUCKING HATE MYSELF.  Seriously.  I want to die now.  If i crashed in my car i would not argue.  Why do i have to be so fat.  I do i have to be such a slob.  I do i have to be such a good for nothing fucker.  I seriously am a waste of space.  I am a good for nothing piece of shit lying on the shittiest path in the whole of the world.  I wish i was perfect.  I wish i could see all of my bones.  I wish i didnt have an ounce of fat on me.  But i do.  Im covered in the stuff.  And i am obese.  I am overweight.  When people meet me the first thing they think is FAT.  They think i look like a man.  Like a butch Lesbian (not that i have a problem with lesbians).  I am ugly and fat...that makes me worthless.  I cant succeed at anything.  I have no control over any aspect of my life.  I cant take a hold of my life.  I cant take a hold of work.  I cant take a hold of the tidyness of my room.  I cant get a hold of being sociable.  And now i cant take a hold of my weight.  THIS PLACE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE.  It is the reason im so fat now.  THEY are the reason why im fat.  They all shovel food in their faces all day long and make me think that the way i used to handle things is wrong.  So i become weak and give in to temptation.  And i eat and i eat and i eat and eat and eat.  I cant starve myself for more than four days anymore.  I used to have so much control.  I used to weigh less and less every day.  I NEVER used to put weight on.  I NEVER binged.  I could starve for 7 days at a time.  And THESE PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY CONTROL.  And Rhea thinks that im an idiot.  Because she doesnt understand.  She doesnt understand that the only time im happy is when im starving and loosing weight.  She doesnt understand that really, anorexia is my way of slowly commiting suicide.  Because i dont deserve to be happy.  I am good for nothing and i should punnsh myself.  I should push my self to the limits because it will make me a better person.  Being on the brink of death will make me a stronger person.  Control will make me a stronger person.  I deserve to be sick with hunger.  I deserve to feel faint.  I deserve to be in pain because my stomach acid is eating away at me.  I am not worth anything until i dont exist anymore.  I want to be so so so skinny.  I think it is beautiful.  I think emaciated stars are beautiful.  Because bones equal beauty and i want beauty.  I want to attain perfection.  And i know that i will never achieve it.  But that comforts me that i have something to focus on.  Because inside i am so ugly and so awful that the only thing i can use to make me beautiful is my bones.  My beautifull bones.  Because everything that is crap in mya life is because im fat.  I have no job because im fat.  I have no intelligence because im fat.  I have no boyfriend because im fat.  I have n ofriends because im fat.  Im not a model because im fat.  Mum and Dad arnt proud of me because im fat.  Ill never be a success because my obesity will stop me dead in my tracks.  I want to be so thin that i disappear.  I want to be swooped up in someones arms.  I want some one to hold my tiny frail body and comfort me and love me because im perfect.  I want people to care.  I want to be so light that i dont leave footprints.  I want to be so tiny that i can walk down a crowded street and no one will even notice me.  I want to be happy with myself.  I want to be able to eat without thinking about the calorie content of every bite.  I want to be able to be normal.  But i cant do that.  So right now im going to destroy myself as slowly as possible.  I want to rot out of this life for ever.  I dont want people to be intimidated by me because im so fucking fat.  Because im so fucking huge.  Wash away my sins.  Make me perfect.  Make my life worth it.  I will give you anything you want.  I will starve until im dizzy.  I will run until i collapse.  I will purge any food that passes my lips. I will puke until i see blood in the toilet.  I will do anything for you.  I will DIE for you.  Take my soul.  Take my emotions.  Take everything just make me perfect.  Make me a shadow.  I trust you.  I trust you with my life.  I know you can make me happy.  I will never betray you again.  I will never feed my face with food.  I no it makes you angry and you are right to make me want to hate myself.  You are right to make me want to slit my wrists.  My fat thighs.  Thighs should NEVER touch.  Make my stomach toned.  Ill do 1000 sit ups a day.  Whatever it takes.  Even if it makes me sick.  Rid my arms of fat.  Give me hip bones that stick out so much that they hurt.  I want to see every vertebrae in my back.  If i can grab any kind of flesh then i am too fat.  Give me a concave stomach.  I want everyone to love me.  I want everyone to be jealous.  I want everyone to envy me.  Ill do anything for you.  I will never betray you again."

"event","Im starting to crave food now.  Im not hungry, just craving food.  Im tired and cant concentrate and i still dont feel thin.  When will i be thin?  Im going to go to the clothes show in Birmingham in December so i need to be PROPPER thin by then because all the top modelling agencies are going to be there and i wanna be in for half a chance.  I know they probably wont like me but its worth a try, ive got nothing to loose i guess.
I resisted two HUGE temptations today.  The first one was at the hairdressers: There was an entire bowl of Cadbury's chocolate eclairs (my favorite sweet) and i didnt have one!  The second temptation was just now: Rob had a bag of yorkies (another one of my favorite chocolate bars!) and he offered me one and i said no again!  And the latter was even more of a triumph because just at that moment i was thinking how much i missed food and i still resisted!  So yay me!
I had three cups of tea today, which isnt that great but it isnt horrendous.  Im going to make some sugar free jelly before i go to bed for tomorrow evening because i feel i might want to binge.  So at least ill have that there to eat so that i dont eat shit loads and put on tons of weight.  It should satisfy me enough to keep going till the end of the week.
Im going shopping in London tomorrow.  Ive made a promise to myself that im not going to buy anything, im just going to look and try things on so that this weekend when i visit Anna ill have something to do while she is doing her assignment.  Its better to sleep on something before you purchase it anyway.  I hope she doesnt want to go out for dinner on the Friday night because i really dont want to screw up.  Im seeing my family for lunch on Sunday and i wont be able to get out of it so i REALLY can eat Friday as well as Sunday.  Im sure ill manage to hold out.
Im just finding it quite tough at the moment.  I know im not at my skinniest and i wont feel like ive got anywhere untill i am.  Right now i just feel like im trying to break even.  It wont be until im beating my lowest weight that ill feel motivated and happy about the whole thing.  At the moment it seems like a chore.  I think that im going to weigh in next Friday and see the horrible truth.  Its got to happen sometime otherwise im never going to loose the weight.
Im not happy.  Not depressed.  Just not happy.  Numb almost. It sucks."

Ill have to force some down me later.  Ive definately lost weight...just no where near enough to look good in my red dress.  Im not going out on the halloween pub crawl...i really dont feel up to it.  Not only did i spend too much money yesterday but i just feel so ugly and fat right now.  Im such a lazy shit...i cant even be bothered to go to the gym tonight.  Its just so dark and cold and i get scared.  Ill go to step on thursday i guess.  Im useless."

"event","So today has been OK.  Not great...but OK.  I had a hot chocolate this morning which was pretty bad i know but it involved a lot more self control than you think.  You see, i usually go into this cafe and buy a hot chocolate with cream AND marshmallows on it, and then i buy a donut and a sandwich (this is on my binge fests which i have been having way too often lately!).  So to go in there today and only buy a hot chocolate without cream and marshmallows is pretty good.  I know its not great because im supposed to be fasting and that broke it.  It was probably about 150cals?  So not horrendous.  Im not going to have ANYTHING else today because of it...kind of a punishment i guess.
I really have to start drinking more water.  Like, yesterday i only had 2 glasses of water and today ive had one glass of water and a bottle of diet coke.  So all in all not great.  And not to mention the fact that i pump myself full of pro-plus which, obviously, is a diuretic (if thats how you spell it).  Its just that when im not thirsty, dinking even a sip of water makes me want to puke.  Im just going to have to force it down me i guess.
I have a horrid taste in my mouth.  Thats the only bad thing about fasting.  And when i have a horrible taste in my mouth i just know that i have bad breadth.  So i brush my teeth like 4 times a day, which really isnt good for them.
I went to the gym yesterday to do a step class.  Last week it was really easy and i hardly worked up a sweat.  But yesterday...OMFG!  Seriously, i nearly keeled over.  I made my step higher this time round and it was such hard work!  I think i must have burned like 400kcal...YAY!  I dont know if this is a good thing but when i exercise hard, i get a really tight and painfull chest.  Is this something to do with me fasting?  I really dont know...i should probably find out.  But i hate the doctors and i really dont want to visit them.
I was pissed off last nite with my friend.  I went to pick her up from the station...IN THE POURING RAIN!  I wouldnt have minded too much but i had already walked through it twice when i went to the gym and i really wasnt up for doing it another two times.  On the way back from the gym i texted her and said that it was pissing it down with rain and that she should get a taxi because she wont want to walk it as much as i dont.  I thought she would text me back and be like ""fair enough"" (considering it was going to be 9:30pm at night through a rough area of town by myself AND of course, the rain).  But instead, she text back saying...""i cant because i have no money on me and i dont want to walk back by myself""  So i wasnt exactly going to go ""well tough shit"" so i went and collected her.  When i arrived (drenched, cold and fucking tired after my workout), the train was delayed.  I sat there for like 20mins, when she finally arrived.  So we exited the station and we were about to walk through the rain back home when she said to me ""shall we get a taxi""  to which i said ""i thought you didnt have any money"" and she was like ""well i have a couple of quid""  I was SOOOOOOO angry!  After all that and she could have got a taxi anyway.  She didnt even say thank you or sorry!  So we waited at the taxi rank for ages and decided that we should just make a run for it.  In usual circumstances i would have offered to hold her bag...but after that i thought id make her suffer!
I dont know, im probably being a total bitch face and all of you reading this probably think that im totally out of order and that i shouldnt complain.  It just put me in a horrendous mood!
Anyway, changing the subject.  I think im going on some halloween pub crawl tomorrow evening, which should be fun but by the same token im so worried that ill get hammered and then eat.  Plus i dont really feel thin enough to go out yet.  But i think my housemates are practically going to drag me out so i might as well enjoy it.  I just wont drink much so that i dont get the munchies.  And rather than hanging in the kitchen with everybody else when we get home...ill just go STRAIGHT to bed.  That way nothing bad should happen.  Plus i dont want to drink to much because it is all empty calories.
Looking forward to saturday...i should have lost a significant amount of weight so i should be feeling alright in myself.  I mean, dont get me wrong, ill still have a long way to go before i can call my self thin but at least i wont be obese.  Anyway, i must shutup because i have to tidy my room, wash some clothes and do some work."

"event","So today has been good.  Ive only consumed 1 cup of tea in total and im off to the gym in an hour or so.  Im so tired, but ill be ok once my body has adapted.  I need to brush my teeth.  Im so relieved ive got control again...i was starting to go crazy.
I kind of pissed off in a mild sort of way.  My friend who lives in the room next to me is coming back from home tonight.  I got a phone call from her at like 4pm asking if i could go meet her at the train station at like 9:30pm.  And of course im going to say yes...but i really dont want to.  For starters im going to have to walk, in the dark, all by myself through a pretty rough area of town just so SHE doesnt have to walk home by herself.  I think thats kind of selfish of her.  She might as well say ""i dont care about your safety but i care about mine""  Also, i get back from the gym at like 8:30pm...then i shower and go to bed and read my book at about 9:30pm.  So now i cant get in to my pyjamas and snuggle up.  My whole routine gets screwed up.  Now i wont be going to sleep until about 10:30pm and im sooooo tired.  I just dont think she should have asked...its a bit inconsiderate.
Adam (a housemate) isnt happy.  I kind of feel sorry for him even though he kinda asked for it.  He isnt getting on very well with the people on his course and he is starting to get real depressed about it.  I think he wants to change his course, or move out of this house.  I hope it all turns out ok for him in the end.  I mean i know he irritates the hell out of me but i would never wish unhappiness on someone.
I really fancy the guy that sits next to me in lectures.  He is soooo handsome.  But now not only does next door fancy him but now my OTHER housemate likes him too.  And she is tons prettier than me and is skinny too.  So i might as well give up on that one.  It sucks that im not good enough for anyone.
Im pretty optimistic that ill be able to fit into my red dress on Saturday.  One can only hope!"

"event","Ok so I didnt quite get a grip of my life like i said i was going to but i definately am this time round!  The main reason being because ive got reason to.  If got goal dates and that always works for me.  First goal date is this Saturday.  Its our halloween party and ive got to fit into my red dress so i HAVE to loose weight otherwise i dont have a costume to wear.  And because ive left it so late im going to have to fast (although im pretty much an all or nothing girl anyway so that isnt really a problem).  I have no idea what i weigh at the moment because my scales are all messed up.  But i can only try my best and try my best i will!  Im not going to eat a single thing and im going to go to the gym everyday apart from Tuesday and Friday.  Im going to pop diet pills and lots of pro plus too.  I should loose at least 10lbs if not more.
The second goal date is next weekend after the halloween party.  Im going to be going to London to stay with my best friend and we are going to be doing tons of shopping and i dont want to go shopping when im fat because i wont look good in anything.
Im so motivated right now.  I have been stuffin my face long enough and now is the time to stop.  Christmas is coming up and i refuse to go into christmas FAT.  Also, i know it sounds crazy but everyone in my house thinks of me as the girl who binges and i dont want that label i want to be the girl who is so strong and so motivated that she can live on air.  Because, lets face it, i dont care if they get worried about me because they cant exactly do anything about it.  Thats the great thing about not living with your family...you dont have to pretend your eating.  I mean, im not saying i can rub it in peoples faces because, at the end of the day i dont want a fuss and i dont want people to be pestering me.  But at least i dont have to worry about making excuses like ""i already ate"" blablabla.  Its kinda nice.
Im sick and tired of putting on clothes and feeling fat...i cant wait until i look good in EVERYTHING!
My Dads buying me a car.  Which is sooo cool.  He had already bought me one but i broke it (he doesnt know that, he just think it spontaneously combust!) so now he is buying me a new one.  I want a smart car but he wont let me have one because ""it wouldnt be able to handle the 3 hour motorway journey you will be doing every month"" which is a fair comment but I want to look cool!  Im so shallow its terrible!  So he is buying me a fiat punto instead which is an excellent car and i do love it but he made the stupid mistake of letting me test drive the smart car.  But really, i shouldnt complain because if i hadnt of test drove the smart car then i would have been over the moon with a fiat punto.  So, truthfully, im really excited about having the FIAT punto!  YAY!
Ive decided that i have to make so much money when im out of university because i have such expensive taste and im going to have such a shock when im paying my own way in life!  So right now im trying to think of the best way to make large amounts of money.  Enjoying my job is totally secondary and the pay is primary.  I used to want to just have a job i enjoyed...oh how things have changed!  I want to be able to wear prada all day and Gucci all night long!  I want a penthouse in London and a villa in St. Tropez!  So i have alot of work to do!
I really want to go on this halloween pub crawl on Wednesday but im not going to be slim enough to fit into my dress by then.  Also, i dont really want to wear it on wednesday and then have to wear it again on Saturday.  So if i go to the pub crawl then im going to have to get another outfit.  I really dont know what considering i have NO money right now.  It would be cool if i could get a great big red jumper and skinny drainpipe jeans and wear my devil horns.  Although i might look like im going to an 80s fancy dress rather than a halloween party!  I really dont know what to do.  Im not going to feel slim enough by then but if i dont go then thats being so unsociable.  Ive only been out one wednesday since ive been here which is pretty horrendous when you think about it!  Its not like im a boring person...im usually a complete party animal!  And ive got to start going out because im never going to meet any guys just staying in and believe me, there are some GEORGEOUS guys here!  So really, i have to go.  Ill just have to buy an outfit of some kind.  That should be fun with no money!
So thats it for tonight's entry i think...chat tomorrow! byeeeee"

"event","Ok so my internet connection ahs been down for like a whole week!  Ive been going crazy without it...so now you guys are going to get an extra long entry.  How lucky you all are!
Well what can i say...its been bad.  I cried all night last night...i did not sleep one bit.  I just realised all of a sudden how much weight i have put on sinse i started university and i freaked.  I freaked because i realised i had lost all control and for some reason i just could not get it back.  But now it seems i have it all under control again.  Im not eating until this weekend (and im only eating then because im going home and i wont be able to get out of eating).  But the minute i get back to uni i will start fasting again.  Basically, i have a red dress that i have to fit into next weekend because we are having a halloween party.  And unless i starve myself, there is no way i will get into it.  Plus im going out on wednesday night with all my housemates and have to be in a half decent state for that.  It wont be ideal but at least ill be at a better weight than what i am at the moment!  I really am quite disgusting.  Im so glad ive got some control back now...such an incredible relief.
Living in this house isnt/wasnt really going quite to plan.  There is this guy who lives with us and he is a complete idiot.  Only thing is the majority of the house worships the ground he walks on.  He lives in the room next to me and he spends his entire day on the phone to his friends slagging off everybody in the house.  I know this because the walls are paper thin (so thin, in fact, that i can hear him snoring at night)  Its a student house so things are going to be a little untidy.  Yes, the kitchen is dirty, yes the communal areas are a bit untidy...but its really nothing horrendous.  This guy (Rob) carries on like its a complete shit hole.  He tells all his friends that he has lived in squats that are cleaner than this house...bullshit!  Seriously, im a neat freak and i dont think its that bad.  Ive heard him calling us ""pikey scum"" ""animals"" ""dirty cunts"" ""they all have BO and bingo wings""  The list goes on.  I wouldnt mind, but it is all COMPLETELY not true!  Im really paranoid that im fat and that i smell now, which is ridiculous because i already had a complex about it.  Now its even worse.  And when you hear someone slagging you off all day long, you start to get really upset.  And i dont want to tell everybody what he has been saying because i dont want to be the one causing trouble.
And on Saturday night he went out drinking on his own and came back paraletic!  He couldnt even stand up.  It was 4am in the morning and i was fast asleep and he came in making SO MUCH NOISE.  He was falling against the partition wall between his bedroom and mine.  No word of a lie, i thought it would collapse.  I had to get up and check that my door was locked because i was so damn frightened that he was going to come in.  He then proceeded to turn his music up really loud and pass out on his bed.  His music was going ALL NIGHT LONG!  I was sooooo angry.  So then we had a massive argument the next morning because i let him know that i was pissed off.  I hate him so much!  There are tons of other stories but i really cant tell them all in one entry otherwise i wont finnish until bed time!
I have a crush on this guy that sits next to me in my business lectures.  I cant stop thinking about him.  Its sad i know.  I havnt even spoken to him!  Im such a looser.  He is so out of my league though so i dont even know why the hell im bothering because he probably wouldnt even give me the time of day.  I feel like that all the time and i get so tired of feeling like that.  I just feel like no one would every want me because im so fat and worthless.  So i dont even bother trying anymore.  He will probably be out on wednesday night so ill see him then.  Im going to be so bloody fat though.  I have no idea what im going to wear!  Thing is, my best friend fancies him too...which as im sure you all know is a nightmare.  She doesnt know i like him and im not going to tell her either because then it will get all messy and horrible.  Plus he will much rather have her over me.  Hopefully ill be 6lbs lighter by then.  Id like to fit into my green dress but i just know that that is never going to happen.  Well its nice to dream anyway!
I feel like me and my friend have been singled out in this house because we dont go out with the house so much and stuff.  Its really unfair because it turns out that people dont really like us because of it and im really upset because apart from Rob i really like everyone.  But Lisa and Anna and Jo like us and that makes me feel fine about the whole situation because they are the people that we are closer to.  At the end of the day you can be best friends with everyone in a house of 13 people.
Im finally going to the gym tonight after many failed attempts.  I actually joined last week but the odds seemed to be stacked against me going.  But im DEFINATELY going tonight!  Im going to ""STEP 'N' TONE nothing too strenuous but i havnt done any exercise for months so ill have to ease into it gently.  When ive got my fitness level up a bit more, ill start using the running machines.  I want to run the marathon which is like 24miles so ill need to do some serious training!  Im going with my friend but she is going swimming instead which i think is a good thing because if she did the class with me we would probably spend the entire time laughing and joking and not doing much exercise!  Im looking forward to it...i need to let of some steam!
Im so hungry right now and its such a great feeling.  Iv got that horrible stale taste in my mouth though so im going to go brush my teeth in a vain attempt to get rid of it!  Im very pleased.  Today i have consmed just 1 cup of tea!  Yay me!  Ive taken 4 diet fuel pills (ill take another 4 before bed) and 6 pro plus.  That should get the old metabolism going!  I stuck loads of skinny people on my wall to motivate me...my housemates might think im weird but i really couldnt care less to tell you the truth.  We had this whole conversation about how i have a warped self body image.  I kept saying how i didnt want to talk about it but they just kept going on and on!  I got really pissed off.  Anyway, i shall shut up now because if i dont i will carry on forever!
BYE!!!"

"event","Iv had such a shitty day today its unreal.  I ate sooooo much!  I managed to restrain mself until about 12:30pm when i just HAD to eat.  And my god did i eat.  I just totally lost all control and i couldnt stop.  I fucking hate mself.  Im such a good for nothing failure.  I ate tons of chocolate and biscuits...UGH!
So i cried.  I cried alot.  because i hate myself and there is nothing i can do about it.  And im always going to feel this way and i dont like it.  Im unhappy when i eat...so why do insist on binging?  Im so happy when im hungry...i feel like i can tackle life.  So why do i insist on screwing it up?
My housemate saw me cry and i feel embarrassed i dont like people seeing me cry because crying means im weak and i dont want to be that.  She tried to help.  She tried to talk to me but i wasnt going to tell her.  She would never understand in a million years.  She would never understand why the fact that i ate a load of chocolate would want to make me slit my wrists.  So im never going to tell her why i was crying.  She knows i obsess about my weight.  She knows i restrict.  I told her.  And i wish i hadnt.  But i only told her bits of the story so she doesnt know much.  She tries to understand and im very grateful that she cares and wants to help...but she will never understand.  I wish she would because then maybe she could help me.
But im going to stop being all depressed and carry on my merry way.  Back to restricting.  Im joining the gym tomorrow and im going to do their aerobics classes.  Like i said...i want to run but its too dangerous to run around where i live.  So im going to spend a silly amount of mone on a gym membership.  I have to be at least 130lbs by friday.  Im not going to fail at this.  Im not going to screw this up.  Im going to get back down to my lowest weight even if it kills me.
Im off to watch Lost now (its only just come out over here in England!)  Its my favorite pogramme...Dominique is soooooo handsome!  WOW!"

"event","I had to delete my section on the computer because it was so messed up.  The viruses are just killing this computer.  I think its all the pro ed sites that i go on.  I need to go buy some kind of anti virus CD that will clear everything off.
Im in such a crappy mood, and its my fault completely.  I havnt done anything worthwhile today and i ate a load of stuff that i really shouldnt have.
I got up at 10:30am, and then messed around on the computer untill 2:30pm when i went into town to get a few bits and bobs.  I bought some skimmed milk and a green pepper because i had a huge craving for one.  I also bought some socks and a CD player because the one i had broke and i was dying without my music!  And then i got back home at about 4:30pm.  I tidied my room (kind of) and cleaned the bathroom because it was absolutely disgusting.  And then i watched a bit of TV until about 6:30pm and then i came upstairs to go online and update my journal and found that my computer was screwing up.  And ive been sitting here since, trying to sort out the damn thing (its now 9pm).
I havnt done any university work, i havnt even organised my files and notes.  I really havnt done anywhere near enough studying this week and i really have to start otherwise im going to fail the degree and that just cannot happen.  So im going to spend all of tomorrow and Sunday working my arse off.  My riding gear arrived today so im going to book a riding lesson for next weekend with my friends.  Its going to be sooo embarrassing because i know that they are going to be much better riders than me and im going to look like such an amateur!  Oh well, ill just have to grin and bear it.
Im having trouble finding a job too.  No one wants to know because of the weird hours i have at uni.  I guess i could get evening work at a restaurant or something but i would much prefer a day job.  Oh well, a job is a job at the end of the day and im not in a position to be picky.  My student loan should come through soon because iv finally applied.  So that should be here in a month or two.
Ive eaten too much today.  It hasnt been a complete disaster but it could have been ALOT better.

1 green pepper
2 cups of tea
1/2 a pack of cheerios(no milk)
10 multivitamins

I dont know how many cals are in multivitamins but im sure its not great.  So all in all, ive made a grand total of about 70kcal.  Its not terrible but id quite like to be able to say 0cal if you know what i mean.  Especially after yesterday.  I still havnt weighed myself but i am starting to feel slightly lighter although i stil have a huge bulge on my stomach!  That will teach me...i binge all week and now im going to have to spend at least 3weeks getting back to a normal weight.  Food is evil!  Its really not worth it at all...its pointless.  You can get happiness elsewhere...you dont need food.  I should really start running.
Rhea's (a housemate) boyfriend is here.  He seems like a really sweet bloke.  I think they are made for eachother, couldnt be a better match if it tried.  Makes me wish i had someone like that...someone that could cuddle me.  I know that friends say that they will always be there for me but it doesnt really make me feel any less alone.
Im going to sort my computer out and delete all the junk and sort the stuff i want to keep into little folder things.  But first im going to watch some TV."

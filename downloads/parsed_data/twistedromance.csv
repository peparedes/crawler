"event","my eyes trace the designs carved into the oak as i calmly tell him that my heart's already trapped in a boys body that should have been six feet in the ground a little more than a year ago. he tells me that I'm a sadistic bitch who will never treat guys like they're human beings. i slowly drag my eyes up to meet his, as we both reach for the bottle of jack. he gets to it first and slides it across the table in my direction, as he mockingly lets me know that i need to numb my mind more than he does. i raise the bottle to him along with my eyebrow and take a long swig, enticing the liquor to warm my body, because well.. i know that his statement's true.

<b>there's spit running down my chin, &&a toilet bowl full of last nights dinner.</b>
 the sweat on my brow is like the condensation on a bottle of beer. the heat is withering me away to the point of nothing. my hands are tremorous as i relive every horrible event that's been plaguing me the past few nights of so-called ""sleep"".
 a name dropped here<b>;</b>or a gaze misplaced there. i can't even look myself in the eyes anymore.

"event","my face is still numb from the rainy winds that tore at me for the last couple of hours. the walk was half-way cathartic. i'm still in the same exact place i was before i left, only considerably more soaked to the bone. my eyes feel glazed over, && unfocused. my hands shake from the sobriety. i've smoked so many cigarettes tonight that i think i'll never have to breathe oxygen again. 

<b>inhale</b>, the fallen leaves crunched under the weight of my flats, the damp muddled colors blending into a amalgamation of brown. <b>exhale</b> the carcinogens float alongside me with every footfall. <b>inhale</b>. too many crowded thoughts crash around my brain. <b>exhale</b>.

as the sorrow creeps in, it gets harder to stand, harder to function. i hit the ground, gasping for breath. my cigarette rolls past my hand from where i dropped it, slowly trying to ignite a wet leaf. i imagine a combination of the sobbing and the cold forced out what little i'd eaten today onto the ground before me, flowing down the rainline towards the cracked earth. the tears fell straight from my eyes to the ground, never touching my face. 

after slowly pulling myself back together i somehow end up home, although i blanked out on the fourty-five minute walk to get there &&then i was standing on my front porch. i'm tired of feeling like this. i'm tired of constantly being sad. i'm tired of letting every little fucking thing affect me. i, i don't know. i just want to wake up happy again."

hands, arms, and shoulders sore from a couple years disuse. i finally sit down from my extensive walk. i have a strong feeling this will become a nightly ritual in the coming weeks. i've recently been looking for what used to make me happy. things that have now become so elusive, they almost seem mythical. these days i'm only amazed by simple things. a rabbit running alongside me for a few hundred yards instead of darting away as i race down the sidewalk. having a streetlight go out as i pass underneath it. the sky breifly washing me like a shower from the heavens, slowly meandering down streets <b>i know better than life.</b>

stopping by a good friends house, we talk. he shares his cigarettes with me, even though he had to scrounge for the change to buy the pack. good friends will do anything for you. and i'm trying to do that for my own. i'm trying my hardest to help them get what they want. and so far, it's been working out. i can keep it up. i can get to the finish line, even on time for once. 

i stopped in levittown park at that new bench and sat down. it was sprinkling, && i could almost feel each and every teardrop from the sky hug my skin before disappearing. thinking about something i shouldn't have been thinking about, i return to my walk and continue racing listening to the rain pelt my back. 

a police officer slowed down, circles and stops me. asking for my name and for identification. he asks what i'm doing out so late. i tell him i'm looking for something that's been lost. again, he asks <b><u>what?</b></u> and i simply respond <b>my youth</b>. confusing crossing his face, he tells me to get on home and to not get into trouble. i'm nineteen years old. the only trouble i can get into is the trouble of the emotional sort. the kind that grabs you and twists you and wrenches your heart all around until you can't get out. && when you finally can, it's all you can do to not fall to the ground and not bother to get up. 

<b>but i'm too prideful to lay on the floor. i always pick myself up and stare disappointment right in the face and tell it exactly what i think, it just smirks at me, telling me it will be back again, always sooner than i expected.</b>"

"event","it's six a.m. and i'm brushing silk-spun  steel support cables from my arms. goddamn spiders, always at work trying to catch something. it reminds me of that one really catchy song by the band whos singer thinks she's too good for the rest of them now. 

i have that feeling in my stomach <b>where it's empty && full at the same time.</b> <b><u>and i hate it.</b></u> i had a yellow backpack strapped on tight with patches and buttons of bands i never listen to anymore. filled with cd's, a jacket, and a scarf. some pens && pencils. a notebook, a couple safety pins. everything you need to <i>survive</i>, the bare essentials. 

you know that feeling you get, when you're doing a shot of alcohol you don't particularly like? yeah, the gag reflex. well, with me it's vlad. there are a few reasons why i can't drink it anymore,  and those precious few who know what i'm talking about, well, i'm sure they'll let this story die down eventually. at any rate, you have the small one point five fluid ounce glass in your hand. <b>you're smiling at it, it's smiling at you</b>, and then all at once it's in your mouth and ready to drop. <u>but it doesn't. it hangs there,</u><b><u>laughing at you.</b></u>  you don't wanna seem like a pussy, so you tough it out, swallow it and laugh back at it and call for another. but maybe, this is just a shitty metaphor. 

there was this one time, that i thought i'd never get your name off of my lips. && when it finally happened, i was relieved. no, estatic. to be able to wake up and breathe. <b>just fucking. breathe.</b> needless to say, there are still things i need to speak to you, but i'll never get the chance. nor do i really want it. 

i was walking by a small creek, and i tossed in a penny. not because i believe in that nonsensical rubbish, but beacuse it was the carefree thing to do. you know, waste money on things that you won't benefit from. maybe i'm trying to speak to someone right now, i don't know. but at any rate, i wished that maybe you'd smile at me. or maybe i wished that i'd wake the fuck up.

recently, i told someone that i never thought i'd be as cynical and jaded as i am now. not even two years ago, i was sure i had it all figured out. nearing my twentieth birthday, well, just shy of a year away. i realize how fucking naive i was. i wish i could change. that i could take things at fact value. but i can't, <b>or maybe i just won't.</b>

  the small talk is overwhelming. i never know what to say to him, and he thinks he knows everything to say to me. he says the past month of his life has been going by slowly. i tell him i've spent the past few weeks in a drunken haze. he tells me that's nothing new, and i don't correct him.

  he's the kind of guy that would go through your medicine cabinets just to see how fucked up you are. depression? he'll call you weak. birth control? he'll call you a harlot. allergies? he'll tell you to stop breathing. i still wonder on occasion why he hasn't told me to fuck off yet tonight, then again, i'm the only person he knows who doesn't condemn him for his behaviors.

  he says that his cousin committed suicide three days ago, and that he doesn't know what to think about it. i tell him that i don't either. he sighs again. he says that ever since it happened, he's not had a sober moment. he also tells me that he doesn't think he's strong enough to face any sort of reality without a drink. i tell him he can, he needs to be there for his son, and that anyone has the strength to do it.

"event","i met up with him in honesdale, outside a walmart. he says, ""hey asshole, get up and give me a hug."" so, being the completely hopeless romantic i am, i comply. it's one of the best hugs i've ever gotten, despite the circumstances. he lets go, and my heart drops a few feet to the shoes hitting pavement. we reach our destination a few minutes later, meeting people because of the shirt i happen to be wearing. i drink a cup of wine, and quietly resign myself to the solitude of the porch.

the car ride back to his house is filled with singing songs i never had the courage to write because sitting on his lap is a girl who will never really appreciate who he is. i may get verbally crucified for these words, but they are what i truly feel. maybe i'm just drunk enough to say these things, then again, maybe i'm just stupid enough. we're debating over which shirt to trade, while he's standing there. all i want to do is kiss him, but i'll never have the fortitude to do so, even if i'm jaded enough to think he wants it.

he walks out of his bedroom in his boxers, so much like the last time and it hits me like the months previous. he's with another girl, and i have to respect that, and the lady in me does. but, it comes down to taking what you want, even if it's an asshole thing to do. but, i always fall short, giving second place to my feelings, and the gold medal to his. i'm probably not making any sense at all, and that is more than completely fine with me. i'm not even concerned with making something well articulated for anyone to read.

i ask him if i can finish his bottle of wine and of course he says yes. it hurts that he's going to bed with another girl and i as always fully accept the fact that i'll never be sure if ""the other girl"" will be me even though i hold out for that chance, that hope. i smoke too many cigarettes as i finish off the wine. i think too many thoughts as i do away with any semblance of coherence. i have too many dreams as i kill my consciousness. and, and, and, i tell myself over and over, ""don't worry courtney, you will have your chance."" no matter how many futile attempts i think i've made.

my best friend drags me out for a walk to talk about the jumbled incoherences rattling around my misfiled brain. she tells me, ""don't worry about it, you'll get your chance with him, again."" and ""if you really love him, and he really loves you, it will happen. quit being courtney and let it happen."" i try to let his reason meet mine in the middle and i'm left with, ""i'm still in love with him, kat. i still fucking love him."" and ""seeing him will never be enough for the miles inbetween.""

so i sit here in the early ante-meridian, typing because i'll never be able to sleep with him so close, yet so far. sometime later today we're trading t-shirts and other stuff. can anyone tell me how that is supposed to even come close to a substitute for his skin and the warmth of his touch?"

"event","""i'll be home in a few hours,"" he says with an air of sadness, ""i need to run a few errands."" as he hangs up the phone, he looks around at his desk. his computer, a few pictures of his family. some folders and a stapler. harry was simply another statistic. a man caught in the daily grind, and it was ripping him apart. 

   the drive home caught him driving aimlessly. the radio had flipped to scan forty minutes ago and harry hadn't noticed. his wife had been sleeping with another man since before they were married. he'd found this out by accident three years ago. he told his depressed therapist about it, and thinking it would help, they had sex in her office. in reality, it was like getting rescued by a sinking ship. when he told his wife she laughed. ""you're kidding me harry, your therapist? how cliche. the least you could have done would be try to fuck one of the interns at work."" he expected her to scream at him, throw things and generally degrade him. elise always let him down.

   he comes to a stop at a red light. the rush hour traffic speeds by despite the freezing sleet falling in sheets. he thinks of how easy it'd be to slam the gas and slide in front of the passing semi. his phone rings, and it takes him a few seconds to fumble it out of his coat. he looks at the id and it's his daughter. ""hey daddy, would you be able to loan me two hundred dollars?"" he couldn't say no. his daughter was the only thing that kept him grounded. his son sided with his wife on everything, and his daughter did most of the time as well. it was really the fact that she came to him with her problems instead of her mother. something in him had changed over the past few months. ""i'm sorry honey, i won't be coming home tonight."" confused, she she asks why. ""i can't tell you, brin. i'm sorry."" 

   he tosses the phone onto the passenger seat and drives up to the cliffs. as a young kid he'd go there with his friends and drink beer and smoke weed. he doesn't even talk to any of them anymore. coming to a stop at their favorite overhang, he gets out and walks to the handrails.

   ""where is your father?"" harry's wife asks liam, their son. ""i don't know. he said he was running errands."" she stops for a moment to think of whatever it could be he'd be doing. arriving at the same time are brinny and ethan, elise's man on the side. ""hi, brin."" ethan says in earnest. ""fuck you, asshole. mom, dad said he wasn't going to be coming tonight, what's with that?"" she looks at her daughter and is even more confused. ""he told liam he was running errands."" ethan sees this as his cue to leave, anytime elise acts worried about harry, it means he's about to get yelled at for being around.

   harry climbs over the handrail and looks down. his tie is waving wildly in the water-filled wind.

   ""mom, call dad.""

   he thinks about how much it's going to hurt to hit the rocks.

   ""harry. answer your phone. answer your fucking phone.""

   ""fuck it."" 

   he lets go."

"event","I remember reading once, that most young adults who've done every gateway drug would eventually try cocaine. i laughed it off, and said i'd never do anything that involved snorting or needles. as i got older, i'd snorted just about every major pill you can snort. most of them at a certain restaurant i worked at in twothousandfive. as of late, i've had certain skeletons with scarred nasal passages clawing at my throat.

The first time i tried coke was in my best friend's living room. another friend brought over an eight ball after i had gotten off work. it was august, and just beginning to finally cool off for the night. i figured if i was ever going to try it, it might as well be in good company on the off chance i freaked out.

I rolled up the ten dollar bill and snorted the line, carefully cut over the lightsaber on the star wars episode five case. pinching the area around my nose i inhaled sharply again, as to insure it's rapid transit into my bloodstream. over the next hour we demolished the baggie.

I still pretended like i'd never done it. I still pretended that i thought it was a stupid thing to do. 

It wasn't until around november that i did it again. a recent breakup had left me isolated and shattered. a friend gave me a call and i staggered down the street to his house. there was a guy there, the kind with the mercurial smile. he was slinging bags of coke and i bought a couple. 

The next night he was there again, and i bought a couple more. there's nothing like the sick feeling you get after doing an eight ball by yourself through a hundred dollar bill. we left there to go to another bar, where i lost another hundred bucks on the futile effort to get drunk when you've done that much coke.

It wasn't until about a week later that i decided never to do it again. there's some back story, but i won't bore you with it. this is all poorly written, and not edited in the slightest. i just needed to get it all out there, i guess."

Leave me the fuck along.""  Dragging yourself to your feet seems like so much effort, here, and, if you do manage, you can't manage.  You can't meet anyone's eyes, afraid they'll ask what's wrong.  But these people are not friends, only fuel to the fire.  They'd never ask.  Earlier that night had you sitting across from him at the kitchen table.  Breathing smoke and drowning in fifty prood liquer.  He looks at you like a prize fighter sizing up the opponent.  Every shot, cracking his knuckles.  Every drag a jab in the right direction: below the belt.  He asks, ""so what happened between you and that guy?""  I stare into my chaser.  ""An analgamation of bullshit, why do you care?""  He looks at me oddly, honestly surprised i'm being this defensive.  Everyone knows me to be wounded, never volatile.  He leans back in his chair and sighs.  ""I honestly care about you Courtney, you know that.  Fucking talk to me, you two breaking up isn't the end of the goddamn world.""
 I laugh.  ""Well yah not the end of the world.  Although the carefully crafted universe of mine, yah, destroyed.""  He pours me a shot and slides it across the slick table.  I down it without so much as a grimace.  Being that intoxicated has its benefits, i suppose.  I am slowly rising to my feet and retreiving a beer from the fridge that will only ever contain alcohol.  He stops me.  Pushes his hands against my shoulders, forcing me against the fridge and says ""You will only ever be happy if you fucking let yourself.  It's your fault you two split up.  You're a pathetic bitch who can't ever see the good in what she has and it makes me fucking sick.""  He let's go, and walks out the door.

The people in the car, your new friends, are taking you to an open mic night.  It's some old house near the University of Scranton that someone remodled into a coffee shop/bar.  It's aptly named ""The College Perk"" obviously after a lame sitcom about people who are really anything but ""friends"".  One of the first acts is a trio of pubescent kids, who look afraid to be in front of a crowd.  They play like they found their guitars in their dads closet and decided it would be a good idea to bang around on them until some sort of coherency emerged.

Between sets and before my friend goes on I walk outside for a cigarette with the driver of this evenings festivities.  We're bullshiting about various starwars plotlines and facts only George Lucas should really know.  It's then that this crusty gutterplunk walks up and asks me if my name is Patches.  To which I reply, ""Who the fuck is Patches?"" He gives me an odd look, even hurt, and walks off.  Then there's the guy who wants so badly to be Ani Defranco.  The hair, the saunter, the banter onstage that could never be catagorized as ""witty"" his music was okay at best.  Focusing too much on style than originality.  Maybe that's all muscians, though.  Back at the bar i'm downing another jack and coke.  This place seems so familiar, yet so anachronistic at the same time.  I feel like I shouldn't have been there for another few years, or maybe I should have stopped in a few years ago and been done with it.  The nicotine fit hits again and i find myself on the porch talking about comic books with a guy who seems about twenty years too old to be there.  Crusty the gutterplank is back and saying something about how i'm such a drewm.  I laugh at the absurdity of it all.  I've moved over a thousand miles to get hit on by a guy who probably hasn't slept in the same place for more than a night in a row."

my body feels like one long dry heave. constantly tensed up, about to collapse at any given moment. my mind feels like one long hangover. always out of touch, yet still in complete pain. the kind where it feels like you've got small bits of glass stuck all over your body, yet there's nothing that can pull them out.

i'm reminded of one night back last november, writing on torn notebook paper while drinking straight jack. pennyslvania was particularly cold that winter. i stood outside smoking reds and trying to calm these beaten nerves. jet's to brazil's album <bi>perfecting loneliness</bi> was the soundtrack to my life, back then. i'd just sit at that coffee table in andrew's house; drink, read,write.  it was one of the most cathartic ""vacations"" i'd ever been on. i wish i knew how to get back to that state of mind. content in my surroundings, content with who i am.

i've finally found happiness, with him. Christopher. it's just, i'm keeping myself from fully enjoying it because i can't let myself go. i cannot just fall and let him catch me. <b>i trust him to catch me, i just don't trust myself to drop.</b>"

   everytime i pass the lone white suburban in the sea of black, i trip, tumble and fall. smacking my head on the wet concrete i begin to bleed profusely from the mouth and nose. i attempt to stand and try to run again, only to slip on a puddle of my own blood.

   one of the assailants catches up to me, grabbing my shoulder and throwing me into the side of one of the vehicles. i struggle against his almost superhuman strength, and start running again. coming to the edge of the lot, jawbreaker's bivouac cues in. i give one last look back at the amalgamation of blank faces as blake screams ""bivouac!"". i feel seven or eight bullets rip through my back, exploding out of my abdomen.

   i collapse on the frozen earth, clawing at the snowy grass, as if to pull myself into safety, wherever that may be. using my elbows and knees, i roll down the hill onto what looks like a freeway, black cars like ants speeding by. i rise to my feet and try to cross only to get hit by a car.

   everytime i wake myself, i'm sitting up in bed, coughing and sobbing emotionless tears. i've had this dream everynight for the past thirteen days."

it was the culmination of a group effort to climb out of the smoldering crater left by the night previous, that kept us moving @ a rapid pace. many failed attempts left us clawing at our burning lungs and aching livers. one by one we stood rank and file, ready to try again. our collective will never seemed strong enough, and for the most part it wasn't. the rough callouses of our rugged hands gripped the glassy crags, pulling us farther, out of the dregs of our mistakes, reminding us why we had been trying so hard. it was only when we finally emerged from the molten wreckage that we realized it was where we truly belonged. 


<b>there is no title that would give our situation an apt description.</b>

he says things like ""i'll never understand you."" or ""you're full of shit."" or even ""you're just a sactimonious bitch."" and all three of these statements would be correct. the extent of his loathing is sad on a level i'll never understand myself. 

i always try to contour with things like ""you don't understand me because you don't want to try."" or ""well, my eyes aren't deep brown for any false show of bravado."" or even ""do you know what santimonious means or did you hear it in some overly clever song?"" and all three of my retorts hang in the air like a helicopter with clogged intake fans. 

he takes another handful of small white oblongs, chasing them with a swallow of maker's mark. i tell him ""you know, you have no right to tell me to stay away from pharmaceuticals. you're worst off than i could ever hope to be."" he sighs and puts his hand on mine. ""you're wrong courtney. you've been in worst shape since before i had the pleasure in knowing you."" the rising crescendo of our apathy towards each other was about to reach it's breaking or boiling point. depending on how you see things. 

from the darkened kitchen, a figure on the floor shouted, ""when you two argue, it's always so fucking anti-climatic. it's like the cliffhanger episode leaving you yearning for next thursdays installment only to find out the network has cancelled the rest of the fucking season."" she slowly stands to his feet; the alocohol casting a dark shadow over his face, as she grabs his jacket and stumbles out the back door. 

in a moment of rare symbosis, we laugh together. i light a cigarette with a book of matches my friend gave to me on her eighteenth birthday. i'm half amazed they're still in my coat pocket as he says ""i had to quit smoking. i hear they're bad for you."" i scoff. ""oh did you now. and who praytell, gave you that little gem?"" he hands me a pamphlet. ""philip morris, of all people."" i scoff again. 

@ this point, my mouth is all crimson tinged from biting my cheeks so hard. i finish the drink in hand and smash the tumbler against the far wall. i sigh as i realize how cliche it is that i'm feeling like bukowski, and how the guy on my right is my red sparrow."

"event","it's that feeling you get, like you've just been thrown through a plate glass window. you want to try and get up, but the torpidity is overwhelming. you're  pulling the tiny slivers out from under your fingernails and the shards that you're laying on arent as forgiving as youd like. the charm that you always wear around your neck has been violently ripped away and it's drowning in a pool of your blood. you sit up, trying to figure out the symbolism in that, but you're far too rattled over some over-analytical metaphor.

you swallow vodka, as a typical anesthetic to your sorrow. the sit mark you made after falling off the mountain was too deep to crawl back out of. you try to take back all of the mistakes, but it's just futile. you set the botile down, and you can't even really read what you're writing anymore.

you're arguing with a poltergeist for interrupting your thoughts, but he swears it wasn't him that knocked the lamp over. he just wanted some soft conversation, but found only harsh words and a notebook thrown through the ghastly form of his periodic analogous apparation. you hastily apologize and ask him to sit down for a drink.

he's trying to tell you that he's recently become an anal sand and that the doctors are becoming army worms and he can't get away. you quickly counter with ""<b>but you're a fucking ghost. you don't even exist. how can they even begin to detain you?</b>"" he shrugs and pulls of the half-empty bottle. the syrupy, freezing cold liquid hits the worn leather with a soft ""plop plop plop"".

you slowly stand up, wavering, grabbing the corners of the desk for a false sense of support. the buttresses of your self-esteem came crashing down when the wrecking ball of their words came smashing through the walls of your self-image. the conflageration that your sanity is being reduced to ash in, cannont be squelched. you slick yet another brick with mortar, trying to rebuild the security in walking upright you once had. 

you wonder where the word altruism derived from as you take blows for people you probably shouldn't. defending them to the death, knowing they'd leave you out to dry, would it serve their ends. the only thing is, you've never had it in you to turn your back on people you call friends, even people you would call family. 

your heartbeat slows, and your eyes dilate. the hallucination that sits in your chair is flickering in and out like bad television reception. he's shuddering uncontrollably, and the tears that fall from his eyes form a small damp puddle near your shoes. you softly mutter ""<b>trepidation</b>"" and he looks up like he was just shot through the heart, had he pocessed one. 

you let go of the desk, and fall face first into the hardwood floor that makes up your metaphysical enviroment. <b>you've finally given in.</b> he sits down next to you, offering a sallow face as a consolement. you sadly smile @ him and close your eyes."

"event","let me tell you about this boy i know.  he's like any other boy you might have had the acquaintence of.  he smiles at you when he knows you're looking, and when you're not, well, he has his arms around some other girls waist. he takes a hit from a pipe, and carefully hides the heroin needles in the hazy smoke. what he fails to realize is, there's one still hanging from his left arm, right below the tourniqut. 

i say to him, ""you're an iceburg waiting for the fucking titanic."" his gaze lowers to his shoes; some scuffs, and the worn away ankles from the braces. <b>too bad my heart is trapped in that hunk of goddame ice.</b> he replies, ""how do you know you're not steering the boat?"" i played this statement over and over in my head as it lolled to the side. ""first off, dollface, it's a ship, not a boat. and secondly, what would it matter if i was behind the wheel or not?""

he laughed. ""first off <i>darling</i>, it's called a helm, not a wheel. and secondly, i guess it doesn't make a bit of difference because according to <i>you</i> it's all <i>my</i> fault anyway, right?"" i was searching for the answers in his trackmarks, and could only close my eyes and say, ""i suppose that's right."" 

he takes anothing hit off the pipe and his hand wavers as the shot glass in mine is rock solid. the exhaling sound cloud fills the area where we're sitting. the stereo shelf unit that's sitting on the coffeetable leaks out; ""<i>so i lean on you sometimes. just to see, you're still there. your feet can't take the weight of one; much less two. we hit concrete</i>."" i laugh @ the irony in that, and turn to him, ""i wish you'd tell me you loved me. i know you do, but people need vocal assurance sometimes."" he shakes his head and says, ""well, you said it. you know i do."" and takes another hit."

over the course of the next few minutes i looked through john nolan's thesaurus for another word for desperate. finding none, i looked up and i had arrived at my place of residence. i walked inside only to discover an item of interest: the telephone. i called a friend and began to talk of cabbages and kings. it was only a few minutes into the drunken conversation that the moisture of a multitude of sorrows began to drench my cheeks in search of any dry skin. i was an utter wreck by the time i said ""goodbye"".

i drove down to the riverfront and took a few pictures of the opposite shore, then some of the rusted train tracks, rushing miles away. i can place him sitting there on that hand rail. or maybe sitting on the bench, slightly turned away. sadly, there isn't anything there.

   my face has been numbed by the driving flakes and i can't feel the blood running from my nose to my chin, and then dropping silently to the cold concrete, freezing instantly to a muddled brown color. wiping it away with a gloved hand and pinching my nose, i curse the dry weather.

   the sky was obscuring the moon, turning the backlit clouds a dull blue. it was an odd sight, that spot of cerulean in a sky turned pinkish-orange by the lights reflected off the blanketed streets towards the heavens. i could see the snow falling through the skeletal tree branches, reaching upward for a light they could not grasp.

""i did love you. part of me always will. maybe that's why it hurst so fucking much."" <b>another word for desperate</b> was currently on the stereo, almost too low to hear. i sat up and grabbed another beer fumbling with my lighter, opening the bottle and asking, ""well how am i wrong?"" he sat up, utter astonishment screaming in his eyes ""do you really think that? do you think i only wanted you beceause of the whole <i>tortured writer</i> aura? that's fucking bullshit. don't you dare reduce me to that."" we let his resort hang in the air as we both watched the neon-glowing stars on the ceiling. i lit up a cigarrette and concentrated on the poster on the wal. i wondered what the hell i was doing there, and shook my head. the cd in the stereo trudged on, playing songs that would only make the situation worst than it already was. he leaned over and pulled the marlboro from my lips and took a long drag off it. ""i really wish you'd quit smoking because these things, they'll probably end up killing you."" he barely caught my mutter ""you first."" he exhaled and looked me in the eyes. ""you know i thought about marrying you once."" i laughed. ""marry me? of all people. that's impossible."" ""i was only sixteen at the time and have no plans on getting married anytime soon."" he looked @ me hurt. ""so you're saying if i had brought it up, you'd have told me to fuck off?"" i wondered how i could handle the damage control. ""actually i probably would have wanted it, too. had you said something. then again, it probably would've ended in complete failure. just like everything else i touch.""  his eyes betrayed his thoughts. he leaned over and kissed me. i found myself kissing him back, even though i know i shouldn't have. he had a girlfriend, even though he treated her like shit. that's probably why he called me @ three-thirty asking me to come over and ""talk"". the song sifting out of the blown speakers sung; ""after all, it's not that bad. i still have pictures. i look back at all the things that we once did. you said, ""i love you."" i guess you did."" i wonder if blake knew how many times his songs would cut through peoples hearts. i slowly stood to my feet, grabbed my keys and kissed him one last time. my stagger towards her door said all the apologies i would never be able to. things like, ""i'm sorry i stopped calling you."" or ""i'm sorry i never picked you up that night."" or ""i'm sorry for anything i forgot to mention."" i got out to my car and sat on the trunk for a few minutes, wondering if i should go back inside and let him hold me until i fell asleep, or if he'd come out after me. ten minutes passed and he didnt come out, and i never went back inside. i climbed into my car, and started on my drive home.

<b>here's two to ease the pain</b>

<b><i>Further North</b></i>

i watched my calloused hands as the cigarette smoke drifted lazily towards the zenith of the room. which rather ironicly, was a fire-sprinkler. inconspicously dangling from the foam ceiling. a conversation replayed in my tired head. an ""<b>i love you.</b>"" that wasn't returned because i had had too much to drink. ""<b><i>because your shoulders make me old and your concerns leave me cold. and it's hard to leave you, but it's harder to beleive you, harder to beleive you, when you smile.</b></i>"" my mind was running like a manual transmission. clutch. shift. release. firstsecondthirdfourth. grindig each gear so harshly as to create a shower of sparks. these sparks are just like the useless synapses firing in my head. although it's getting to the point where this metaphor is so tired my engine won't turn over. i chain smoked and drank whiskey while watching the sun rise over PA. <b>a boy i'd do anything for</b> (even though i'm not sure he knows it) once told me ""less is more"" but i'd never been one to know a goddamned thing about moderation. i've been destroying my lungs and live for a few years now and i don't know when i'll want to stop. 

<b><i>an object is only as strong as it's weakest point</b></i>

maybe its like the caustic alcohol and the cotton-sterile pills that help me keep my balance, that scare away the shakes. it gives me just enough clarity to focus on not falling apart. <b>maybe it's because the only time i can talk to you is when i've had a drink.</b> it screens everything coming in so goddamn punitively and leaves the door wide open for anything going out.
maybe it's like all the safety glass that explodes in a million tiny shards from an impact just forceful enough to completely shatter your resolve. like an ornate picture frame, probably made of spruce or something equally as light, cracking and splintering at the corners in a slow motion haze. camera pan to the left or right, so as to give the illusion that yeah, that did just fucking happen. <u><b>maybe it's like everything i'll never become.</u></b> <i><b>what i can't achieve.</i></b> my white flag rolled up tight like a newspaper. for defense purposes only of course, never surrender. an envelope full of apologies has been addressed to a buoy anchored off the atlantic coast.
   if you need me, i'll be looking for my deus ex machina.


that's it for now.




and one last sentance for you in here.

   i only remember everything that can't help me, only hold me back. keeping me down from what i need to reach and to grab onto. shaking all those thoughts i don't need to be thinking out of my battered head, i smile. because i realize it's over and done with. nothing i can do will change any of that. so i've given up trying to fix it; it's broken beyond repair. that's more than fine with me. because my care and interest was lost with the setting sun.

<b>wisdom found by starlight.</b>
walking along the cracked sidewalks, i look to the sky as i am often found doing, just as his voice beckons a request, and then croons a well thought statement, <i>""look at all those stars, look at how goddamn ugly the stars are.""</i> and you know what? he's right. one hundred fucking percent correct. the stars are hideous. but not because of some defect or anything of the sort. but because of their sheer beauty. it's all i can do to keep the welling tears from spilling past my eyelids. but they slip past anyway. and while one snuck by, he signaled the safety of doing so, and his comrades-in-arms swiftly dropped their weapons and joined him resulting in staining my wind-blown cheeks. dropping to my knees casting my arms to the sky i ask why. i can now hear my sobbing over the music and i know there's something more wrong here than just the stars. i have a million questions screaming for answers inside my head. they escape one by one. one question for every tear, and by this time, theres been too many to count. i grasp a hold on the last solitary question, beating an answer out of it. it can't respond, for answering it would be suicide in a sense, wouldn't it? i suppose so. i pick it up, dust it off and hand it my coat. i figure i can only take this one with me until it's time to actually utter it to someone, rather than just myself.

<b>eh, this one has no name.</b>

my head aches. my body is weak. my mind is tired. yet the words continue to flow from my fingertips to the keyboard on which they rest. i've tried many times to stop and get some rest, but they won't let me retire now. not this time. i have too many things to say and not enough paper to write on. i have lost too many words to the stale air and deaf ears. i need to be heard. and i need someone to understand me. but the only thing i have anymore are action figures from another time that will gaze at me with their unblinking painted on eyes, forever doomed to a life of discarded memories. these words are flowing faster than i can type them, let alone think them. i guess you could say this is the crack in the dam(n) of my writers block. it's been set free. my wild attempts at releasing the floodgates and placing dynamite have finally succeeded, but i don't know if i can avoid the wall of water. it might consume me, but i'm not yet sure if thats a good or bad thing. so far so good. it's calming down, and only a trickle saturates the soles of my wingtips. it's then i realize i wish to be washed away in its fury. too often we see what we want too late, and then it's moved on and gone. i'm the guy at the train station waiting for the conductor to call for his ticket, but the train left without him on a lonely weekend night. ""it might make a second run."" he keeps telling himself. not sure who he should believe; himself or the tracks laid before him. i should end this here and go for a drive before finally settling down to sleep for a few hours, but i don't know if i'll do that or not. sleep sounds mighty enticing. friendship with certain people is priceless, i hope to never lose them. i can tell them anything, and they can do the same with me. i've entrusted to them every secret, and also, them with me. i'm touching base on many subjects with this one solitary piece of writing and i don't know where all of this is springing from. just sort of coming out. i'm not changing anything, once its typed out, it stays. this is one writing censorship will not touch. theres stuff awaiting a breath of fresh air, but i somehow keep it locked up inside my head and won't let it out. at least not yet. maybe not ever. i'm not going to play a smoke and mirrors game with this piece of writing. i'm not dodging any issues, everything is laid bare. and any analogy is easily seen. and if you have any questions, ask me and i'll clarify it all. speaking of clarity, thats one department i've been lacking in lately. confusion with a few things and i'm awaiting that break in the clouds, but the storm only seems to be getting darker as of late. but it's always darkest before the dawn right? right. so with that being said i'm going to get out my flashlights and candles in a futile attempt to chase the clouds away. this is a storm i can't chase away on my own, but i can only wait. i've been waiting all my life for that one big break. you know, the one where i ""make it big"" so to speak. i'm not talking fifteen minutes of fame or anything ridiculous like that. just the break where life takes its foot off of my head and lets me up for a breath of air. because if it doesn't hurry up, i'm going to break it's ankle. i bought a helicopter and promptly burned all my bridges only to turn around and see i spent all my fuel on the rickety wood. fuck. but i'll get out of this just like i get out of everything else. or will i? good question. daylight is creeping through the window and i want it to stay away, because with daylight brings more confusion. i'm better left with the night and my thoughts. well, maybe not. maybe thinking too much is the cause of all my problems. my overworked mind was ruined by school and teachers constantly pushing me to be the best i could be. so i spent my school years bored with nothing to do. only challenged by history. i was fascinated by all the people gone by, the things they did and accomplished. and most of all, by world war one and world war two. simply because the sheer magnitude of it all. knowing the only way i could ever amount to anything was to use my imagination to think up stories and songs and everything to try and show people what i had in my mind. what was running around up there. so far, so good. some people have fallen in love with my writing. others, they casually toss it aside without a second glance. what you make of it is up to you. i give you no preconceived notions of what to expect, i leave it all up to you, the reader. the adventurer. the philosopher. the child. the adult. whatever you may be, or whatever you may want to be. at a ripe age of almost eighteen, i've been through some of the worst mentally and emotionally challenging things you can imagine. if you know me really well, i would have told you by now. i can only think of one person who knows the biggest and worst of all of those. and how it still hurts me to this day. and how i've forgiven them. taking shit to heart and never letting go will just set you up for more pain and suffering down the road. letting go and forgiving is the only way to truly live in this fucked up world. otherwise, you'll just make yourself sick with mistrust and pain. a long time ago, someone close to me said, ""you and only you have control of how you live your life. so make the best of it."" while these are common words spoken together as a line of advice, i didn't believe them when i heard them eight years ago. now, a bit older i finally realize just how right those words are. only you can tell yourself what to do. i thought my life was planned out for me. i thought i would live and die in this shithole town. but i'm not going to. i'm getting out. i'm writing. i will get published, i will make money. i will do what i want with my life regardless of who says i can't. and i will laugh in their face the whole time. i understand you are probably sick of reading this, and yes, i understand it's very long. so you can stop reading here if you want, and that wouldn't hurt me at all. i only write for myself. sure, it's on a public journal and many people read it. but that doesn't change the fact i'm writing for me and no one else. i'm not holding back. i'm not sugarcoating anything. i wouldn't view this as a rant, more of a slew of thoughts thrown together by lack of sleep and sanity. it will probably only make sense to me. but if it does to you too, then thats a plus. i hope you can get some insight from this. or i hope it confuses the hell out of you. whichever happens, i'm sure you'll be fine with it. i've read many things where i walked away more confused than ever. but on the flipside i've read many things that turned the light on for me. i don't really know if this is the former or latter. more than likely the latter. but fuck, i'm only seventeen, what the fuck do i know, right? right. of course. teenagers know next to nothing right? right. i thought so. i'm glad you agree. 
and so my fingers start to slow, and my head starts to get slightly heavier. and sleep starts to sound more and more reasonable. and i'm holding some stuff back although i previously stated i wouldn't. that's alright i'm guessing.

"event","in the city that never sleeps, he walked streets lined with skyscrapers. he stared with hollow eyes into blank faces as the masses rushed passed him. it was rush hour in Manhattan. his abject view on life had brought him to where he was. living on the streets, always carrying a gun, mugging when he had to, robbing when he had to, and occasionaly stealing a car. he knew the streets better than the cops and he had only been living there three months. he had a few aquaintences. they would never be considered friends because how he lived, there were no friends, they'd sell you out for a meal. they were just people to trade with to get tops on how to steal and rob and such. he had no recollection of who he was, or where he was from. the first day he remember he woke up wearing a tshirt, jeans, and boots. he assumed whoever it was the mugged him took the money && i.d. from his wallet. he went to the police station to see if they could help but every time he went in, they would turn him away and he didnt understand why. he would always look @ the t.v.'s in the window to see if maybe his picture would appear but it never did. the only thing he really realized he needed a coat. he stopped in a store for a smash and grab job, tried a jacket on, it fit right so he ran out as a fat cop was walking by. startled by the officer he bolted to the right into the mass of people. the cop gave chase for a few blocks before finally giving up. he proceeded to sit behind a dumpster to catch his breath and remove the tags from the jacket. pulling out his knife, an old bum hobbled over to him and asked him for a match. he gave the match to the man and watched as he hobbled back to the fifty-gallon drum he was previously huddled over. the old man lit a piece of dirty paper on fire with the match and dropped it in to the can to produce a rather large flame from the debris inside. he watched the man stand next to the fire with his hands outstretched and thought that he never wanted to end up like that. after cutting the tags out he stood up and put the jacket on and made his way out of the alley. he had a few bucks in change so he decided to stop in a diner the he always drank coffee in. he sat down, ordered his coffee and leaned his elbows on the countertop. he had noticed a most beautiful girl sitting in the corner with some other girl. she noticed him staring, but instead of glaring back, she got kind of a faint smile on her face. he knew he had no chance with her, seeing as how he was homeless. so he turned away and stared into the murky deep of his coffee. he stood up just as they were leaving, and as he put his jacket on, the girl got a most unusual look on her face. she stared hard @ face, he countertopthe opportunity to shave in about a week and a half, and he was pretty dirty. she then burst into tears and embraced him. he had no idea what was going on, but held her anyway. she finally pulled back after a few minutes of intense sobbing and said, ""Greg, I thought you were dead."" 

(there you go. i'm sick of getting harassed to write a ""happy"" story.)"

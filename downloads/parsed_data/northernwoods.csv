"event","<p>E.O. Wilson has said that humans are naturally attracted to parklands.&nbsp; Specifically, we like to be situated up high with a view of said parkland or savanna, and&nbsp;a body a water completing the scene.&nbsp; His hypothesis is that this landscape is what our homeland of Africa looked like.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, I think he might be right.&nbsp; Our last home had all of these characteristics.&nbsp; The house was on the peak of a hill, with a view of oak and hickory savanna sloping into a valley.&nbsp; There was a small creek in the valley and a pond down there too.&nbsp; Almost everyone who visited our home commented on the view.&nbsp; It was an informal sample, but highly supportive of Wilson's idea.</p>"

"event","In this small piece of the world at least, I get to be the protector.&nbsp; I may cut a little firewood or fell a tree for bow staves from time to time.&nbsp; But selfishly, I also want the ability to disallow any other human disturbance.&nbsp; Big trees can be hollowed by time and the elements to&nbsp;provide homes for my wild neighbors.&nbsp; They can fall to the ground and enrich the soil.&nbsp; Predators can roam through with at least one less death threat.&nbsp; It isn't about playing God.&nbsp; It's about being a personal witness to&nbsp;the hand of the Universe at&nbsp;work.&nbsp; The ownership is mutual.

"event","<p><em>""A knowledge of place is grounded in those aspects of the environment which we appreciate through the senses, color, texture, slope, quality of light, the feel of wind, the sounds and scents carried by that wind.""<br /><br />K.C. Ryden<br /></em><br />A sense of place&nbsp;requires more&nbsp;than just the technical knowledge of a region.&nbsp; It comes from spending every season there, until the subtle and mundane variations and consistencies are catalogued in the brain.&nbsp; The sound of cottonwood leaves rattling to the ground or the scent of those same leaves decomposing into the black soil will remind you of all&nbsp;your previous exposure.&nbsp; It was last fall during the blackbird migration.&nbsp; It was 20 years ago when&nbsp;the channel catfish were biting&nbsp;in Buffalo Creek.&nbsp; That's home.<br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","""You belong to the land,"" Carl murmured, ""as you have always said.&nbsp; Now more than ever.""

""Yes, now more than ever.&nbsp; And the land belongs to the future, Carl; that's the way it seems to me.&nbsp; We come and go, but the land is always here.""

They went into the house together, leaving the Divide behind them, under the evening star.&nbsp; Fortunate country, that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out again in the yellow wheat, in the the rustling corn, in the shining eyes of youth."

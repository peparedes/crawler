Heaven seems to be my only rival
wicked though the words of men
against my strength my vengence send
towards the angels, deamons bless me
holy beings they detest thee
God had sent us down to hell
and for this bullshit we rebel

Blastpheming in the cell i wallow
strapped me down i try to swallow
water through my rotting carcass
I'd break out but my strength is drained
struggle with the rusty shackles
God is there i hear him cackle
he'll take a break when things are slack
and I'll stab the fucker in the back

send your gifts upon me now
strength and speed to be endowed
upon the empty shell thats me
this will make the world complete
without him there to watch and wait
his armies I will decimate
this mother fucker has to pay
I'll be the one to kill Yahweh."

"event","I fucked up. I fucked up bad. I guess that's because of the fact that I'm a lousy fuck of a person, too fucking complicated for my own damn self to understand, let alone try to explain to the person you love. I can't figure anything out anymore. I can't think straight, I'm unable to solve any of the problems I have. Not like I use to. I use to solve one or two every once in a while to keep the stack from building up, but I can't anymore. Or maybe I won't, or just don't care enough anymore. Maybe I think they'll go away. Maybe I just wish that I wasn't me and didn't have to put up with thinking about so much shit at the same time. Maybe I wish I weren't living. I don't know anymore. I can't wish for four hundred different things at once but my mind seems able to contomplate the consequences of each wish. I don't want anything for myself. I never really have. The only thing I want is for her to be happy. It'd be nice if I were able to do that for her but I don't see how I can when she wants to know how I work and I can't even figure out how I work anymore. I just don't know anymore. I use to have the answers to so much. The only things I do know are that I love her and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes for me to show her how I work, show her that I care, make her happy, be what she wants me to be...be myself.

"event","Other than work (and family, that's never a good thing for me,) things have been going great. I'm completely head over heels for her, I hope she knows it. I hope I show it well enough that she'll never forget it when she thinks of me or sees something that reminds her of me. Everything at the moment reminds me of her. I can see the most obscure thing and I'll think of her. So that's going well, I actually don't think it could get better. Art is going well. I've had some weird sketches that I'm doing in art. One is of a nude man freefalling from a building to the ground below. The point of view is from above and it's a fisheye view of the city so everything bends outwards. That one, and I'm doing a watercolour of a man that is collapsed with his arms spread out on the ground and a syringe and needles lying on the ground. The other one I'm doing is a homework assignment. We have to do a hand study. I'm drawing a hand with slit wrists, the blood running down the hand and dripping into a puddle. Out of the puddle is another arm and hand protruding made of blood, and in the hand made of blood is a razor that's slitting the fleshy hand's wrists. Because of all of these, my teacher called me psychotic, but whatever. Screw her for not having weird ideas. I went to see Slipknot, Shadows Fall and Lamb of God in concert. I don't even have to say anything, it was fucking amazing. No words needed to tell the story. The band names alone should do it. Other than that, I can't think of much else to tell. Just playing guitar and doing art. I'll update in a few days probobly. Other than that, fare thee well, and goodnight to all.


I love you."

"event","So as of now, I need to shave the sides and back of my head again so my hair doesn't get poofy. That wouldn't be cool. I need to get it redyed also but that costs money that I don't want to spend on my hair, so that's not happening for a paycheck or two. Things are going well around here. Problems have sorted themselves out for once. That never happens to me. Unfortunantly, however, my desire to live is still the same...nonexistant, but I don't believe that'll ever change. That's the one constant in my life. I'm trying to get my friend to give me a ride to see Slipknot, Shadows Fall, and Lamb of God in Hampton, Va. on the 18th of March. I'm not sure how the outlook on that is going to be though. I've been using my airbrush, which I love so dearly. The abstract piece that I'm doing at school will turn out pretty good I think. Should be nice. Doing stencils is a lot of work though, but I won't get into that. Not much else to say really. Failed attempts at writing poetry and lyrics. The words just aren't coming out the way I'd like them to come out, and that upsets me greatly. Oh well, I can't do everything, though I'd like to think I could try to. Peace."

"event","This week has been one of the most stressful for me in a long while. I won't go into most of the reasons. I don't really care to in fact. I wish she knew what she meant to me though. It's been hard to keep myself together with people trying to interfere and telling me all sorts of shit, and it's even hard to keep believing in those situations. Even worse are the already bad mental/pshycological issues of mine, which just add onto the pile of shit people keep building. She probobly thinks that I think she lied to me, though I've believed what she's told me the entire time. I honestly can't think straight anymore. I miss her so badly, the way she talks, how she falls into my arms, the look she gives me when I'm gazing at her. Mostly, I miss spending my time by her side. I have to believe there's some ammount of hope left for me, even though there most likely isn't. I have to believe that when she said ""wait for me,"" that she meant it and will come back for me. I'll end up waiting too. It's been a week and it's killing me but I can go on a while longer. I'm not me without her, and that something I'm not use to. I want to be with her again, but I'm afraid for the time being, there's nothing in my power I can do to change it...


""A Deep Breath"" written and performed by Deadstar Assembly www.deadstar.com

Never thought we'd end up this way
Never thought everything would change
Its so hard to leave your side or to stay
I never believed in Fate
But I guess thats all we really need
Are we meant to be?
Or are we gonna fade away
Going to fade away
It's fallin apart thats how it feels
This pain in our heart is all too real
But maybe someday there'll be something left
I'll take a deep breath
I remember the vision so clear
Now your down on the ground in tears
The blood on my arms is the same as you crying
I saw you walking to me
Surrounded by the beauty
Now everything that we are is dying
Now it's dying
Can't we live with the difference
Of what we thought our life should be
Can't we live with what we have
And let the love just set us free 
From the pain..."

"event","So I have an airbrush, and I have my guitar...Oh, and today I got my hair dyed, black and red, like Dro, only his looks better. I've been listening to a shitload of DSA (Deadstar Assembly) lately, as well as my normal assortment of metal and other musics I usually listen to. I'm a bit pissed that I have no band for this years Battle of the Bands. It's really not fair at all. I've spent at least four hours of every day of my life for the past four years playing guitar (usually even more than four hours, especially in the summer, up to twelve hours then) and what do I have to show for it? Just a shitload of people that say I'm wicked good at guitar and a bungload of bands that don't want me as their guitarist. Not too cool. I know one really talented drummer around here, and no one else. He's not a big metalhead like I am anyways. I honesly don't know why I continue to play if I can't seem to get a band together and can't seem to have another band take me in as their guitarist. I'm thinking that if by next year I don't have a band for battle of the bands, I may just throw the towel in on it. It's not worth the time and effort I put into playing to not go anywhere with it.
Keyboard...meh, I'm progressing slowely in that. No where near as fast as I'd like. But that may be because all of the keyboard parts I try to learn by ear are by Dream Theater. In other words, they're rediculously hard to play. My favorite would have to be Space Dye Vest though, off of the Awake album. Great song, great keyboard part.

As far as my regular life, it is terrible as usual. My mental problems have been worse than usual, along with my sleep and eating habits. I've been going without sleep and food quite often, up to three and four days in a row without each. I'm not sure if I'm losing weight or what but it doesn't matter to me. I could frankly care less in the end. It's just more of the same shit I've dealt with for five, almost six years. I think I can handle it getting worse. My only vent now is guitar. Art has somewhat stopped being a vent. I haven't had good ideas for a long while, since the first nine weeks of school. Not very good for me. It use to be such a great way for me to get things out of my head. Now I couldn't put anything interesting to me onto the paper if I tried. It's sad really, but not quite suprizing to me. So now, I resort to the hours I get of guitar playing to vent emotion. That or self abuse but lets not get into that. That's not a topic people enjoy discussing with me.

My friends are few and farspread now. Your ""friends"" seem to disappate when they learn things about you that they never thought could be true. All the better though. I don't like people.  Everyone again asks what's wrong with me now. I've separated myself from as many people as possible, but some inevitably try to stick onto you and bring you back to the big group. Not as fun as you'd think. Half of the time now, the only reason I talk is because I want to know something from someone. If not, I don't make much noise. Invariably, I can't think of much else to type right now. I should probobly try to get some sleep because I didn't sleep last night. I'll see if I can't update this more often. It's been a while since I have, nearly three months. Fare thee all well.

                                       Normal people don't act that way
                               Who wants to be normal anyways...."

"event","Well god damn, nothing ever goes my way does it. Marilyn Manson concert...fucking sold out! Bastards. On top of it all, I have no band still, as no one seems to need a person that can play seven string guitar. Bastards. Salisbury fucking sucks, as well as the entire state of Maryland for that matter. Everyone and everything here blows, and the world knows it. Work on the other hand...well nevermind, work sucks too. Chuck E. Cheese is only fun on the weekends. And what the fuck, you'd thing people would have figured out by now that I fake being so happy and bubbley all the time...but damn, people is Salisbury...are slow..for the most part. So I'm still stuck being Mr. Happy Pants that gets asked what's wrong a billion times by everyone I know. Yeah well they can bite me. I'm sick of it all. I obviously can't change where I live so I get to whine about it on here. I hope someone reads this, chokes on it, and dies so I can laugh at their cold blue corpse. On a lighter note, I've gotten kickass at playing my new guitar. Quicker than I thought I would anyways. Especially with working thirty hours a week. I'm a game nerd now, so no one talk to me. I play CS, BW, SC, D2exp, T2, WCIII, and WCIII TFT. If you don't know what those abbreviations are...don't ask, I don't like explaining. My clan kick ass. Clan GoD. GoD is short for Guardians of Darkness...got a problem with it? Didn't think so bitch. Check us out at www.clan-god.net  So now my computer sucks and I'll have to buy a new one with my own money. I'm going with an AlienWare unless my brother can help me build one by myself from scratch. Lots of shit to buy though. That and I need a new amp system and art supplies. An airbrush is on that list. Actually that's the top on the list. My brother's wedding is coming up though and I have to write a speech because I'm the best man and I also have to buy them some wedding gift...I have no desire to do that. And frankly, they don't even need me there to have their wedding. I could sit and rot here in my house for all anyone cares, myself included. The only time I had a chance to get out was this past saturday and Steve had a soccer tournament to go to. I ended up having to work in his place instead of play in the CS tournament that I wanted to go play in. I mean, that's a chance to win a bungload of money, depending on how many people show up. But whatever. Screw you all. Dream Theater owns you, as well as my new guitar...and myself included."

"event","The Dream Theater double DVD combo is a wonderful thing to behold. I suggest anyone that likes them at all go out and buy it. On another note about them, I missed their third concert this year. Really pissed me off. They were playing with Yes, another wonderful band. I suppose there's always going to be others in two years when they put out another CD.
Princess Mononoke is single handedly one of the best, if not the best, animated film I have ever had the honor to watch. Everyone should go and rent that movie, Spirited Away, and Castle in the Sky. Those three along with Akira, Ninja Scroll, and the Animatrix are rediculously awesome.

Onto another topic that greatly concerns me, yet seems to concern no one else in this pathetic universe anymore. Honor. Why is it that almost everyone I know stoops to a new low and does something outragiously dishonorable? Everyone now is always sneaking behind peoples backs, not stepping up to a challenge, running away from something in their lives. Rise up to it. Face it with everything you're made out of and defeat whatever it is causing your problems. Maybe it's a dead way of life and I'm clinging onto the hilt of a shattered sword. That's what people say about Wicca. It's dead, the Pagan way of life is done for. Look to the monotheistic god to save you. Well, for me, that is like taking the easy way out by giving up. I'd rather die than back down on something, especially if I know I can uphold what I'm standing for. If I were to have my way, we would all be stuck in Medivil Japan, under the rulership of the Shogunates, and we would all be following Bushido, the way of the warrior. But since nothing is my way aside from my own life (and that I sometimes even wonder if that is my own anymore), I suppose I'm officially outdated. Maybe after I die someone will realize the way I lead my own life and come to respect me then. Until that time comes, and I hope it comes soon, I can only wait and hope that honor returns to the average person. I'm done now, and I assume most of the people here won't even make it down to reading this far, so for those of you that did, good job."

"event","I found tonight very ironic for me. My friend in Virginia, Kim, told me that this movie Donnie Darko was the bomb and a half. So after I moved here to Maryland, I met Chris, and he told me the same thing so I decided to rent it this weekend. I watched it tonight, and the very last song in the movie (not including the credits) had lines that go as such:
""I find it kinda funny
 And I find it kinda sad
 When the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had""

The only reason I find it ironic is because Saturday morning I woke up from a dream in which I died and it definantly was the best dream I've ever had. Those of you ""happy"" people might not get where I'm coming from. And those of you that think I'm really a happy kinda guy...wow, take another look. I admit it, I'm a fake. Whatever. There's no denying I'm not happy whatsoever, so don't try to tell me that I really am. Death would be a blessing, and as such, the dream was fantastic. Rent the movie. Donnie Darko and The Cell rule. Tomorrow night I'm watching The Godfather, so if I find anything ironic or somewhat moving in that movie maybe I'll tell you. I'm running out of things to babble about though. Maybe next time I dream that I die, it will really happen. I can only hope."

"event","I just watched the movie The Cell. It has Jennifer Lopez and some other famous people in it. For those of you who have seen it, now you know what it's like inside my mind. For those of you who haven't seen it, rent it only if you don't get ""disturbed"" easily. Hopefully some of you have figured out that I'm quite disturbed up inside my mind. Yes, there is something behind all the hair. And, I'd have to say that even by my own standards, it's messed up quite a bit of the time. So I'm deranged, and I like The Cell, so go rent it if you can handle it. Or you could maybe sit down and try to pry into my mind, but that might be even more disturbing than the movie. Either way, have fun."

Did what you thought was best
Now my pain is for all to see

Rose above the rest, and now I

Struggle to my feet again, and
Hope to regain balance, I
Wish for better days to fly again

Pounding me into the ground

"event","She sits in the corner
Watching people pass her by
wondering what she's doing wrong
the words running through her mind are
why can't I seem to find who I am
Why can't I gather some knowledge of myself

She grew up as the outcast
Seperate from all the rest
Lost inside her desperate thoughts
loathing life and loving the spirit of death
Can't people change their actions
Can't people understand that they've made this child a wreck

Colours all must fade away
replace them with the shades of grey
only then will we find outselves
and others that we've left behind

Kicked into the gutter
in too deep to think of getting out
she watches on the sidelines
as old ""friends"" begin to turn their backs
consumed with their own beings
consumed with mortal power and not with spirit

Colours all must fade away
replace them with the shades of grey
compassion must eventually find a place
to be buried in and erase our hate

Thoughts of life have gone
stretched beyond the limit
love abandoned this helpless soul
now a magnet for manevolence

speared by memories of past attempts
letting nothing stop her now
no one standing in the way

internal fires set ablaze
glinting silver stained by red
a self serving sacrifice
to ease her of this pain

crimson puddle gathering round
rhythems slow and break the beat
almost gone, a mere memory to others
but the last thing that she sees
are the colours fading to grey



I don't like the first two stanzas. Tell me if I should edit them or destroy them or what. In fact, that goes for the whole song. I don't know about it. It's really wierd that I'd write this, especially since I've never been so happy in my life. But whatever, writing is writing, and I can't help what comes out of my mind until it comes out of my mind. By the way, the picture (if it shows up) is of the type of dog my dog Max is. He's a Shiba Inu."

"event","Yesterday (friday) was good stuff. Although I guess since technically today is sunday, friday would have been two days ago, but whatever. Friday, I skipped first, second, third, and fourth period to go help plant trees outside of Bennett. So it was a lot of talking with people, but planting stuff was sweet. I like nature and love being outdoors and helping make things look nice. It was just a bonus for me. The day was beautiful. Blue skies, slight wind, sunny, great temp. Oh, and so lunch time came, and I somehow end up in second lunch (suprize suprize) and (amazingly) ended up sitting with Liz, Pam, Ally, Ben, and bum bum bum....Natalie :) Good stuff huh? Yeah, especially when I put a gummy bear in my nostrel, and tried to blow it out, but snot came out the other nostrel...that musta been cute. Anyways, my art project is turning out finally. It's a hand that's bent into a wierd possition, and incents will be coming out of the four fingers. But after art, I left school, and went to Illusions. Illusions is a gaming store for games like Warhammer and Dungeons and Dragons. They just moved to their new store, which is totally sweet, and I used a coupon to get a $30 item for only $20! Sweet stuff yes? So I finally get home, sit down, paint some models, and then play guitar and sing. I sang for a good while. Guitar I didn't really play at all much friday. Didn't feel like it. My voice can go really high now without going Falcetto. Up to a D above high C. Which, by the way, is REALLY high for a guy to be able to sing. And no, I don't have my sister kick me in the gonads every time I sing, haha. So I called Natalie afterwards. She had her first day of work at Chic-Fil-A. She said it didn't go too bad. It's quite rediculous though. I've been searching for a job for a little over a month now, and haven't found one....she got one in like a week. I personally think it's just because she's so adorable and gorgeous, and totally awesome in every aspect...but that's me. So saturday, I wake up, shower, and then Louis comes over and we play guitar for four hours. Got another song, on top of the one that we finished last week. That was fun. Called Natalie again. She was at her dads. We like talked, and then there was complete silence for a minute or so because neither of us could think of anything to talk about. I'm really bad with that when I'm talking to her. I'll have to work on it. But then we started talking again, and her cousin is totally crazy. She was like giggling and stuff in the back ground and saying ""boogie woogie uggie"" and other wierd things. Twas interesting. It sounded like a pigmy native in the background while I was talking with Nat. Then she had to go eat, and so did I. My parents made me drive them around all night. How gay. We went to Tia's for dinner, which the sign says it's Mexican, but it's actually Tex-Mex so it's not really Mixican, or hispanic at all. False advertising. Bridget works there, so I saw her. That was nice. Came back home and watched Timeline. It's based on the Michael Criton book, which is supposedly really really totally awesome, but I haven't read it. I need to. The ending was so romantic and stuff, and it was just really good. Action packed too. So yes, I'm officially bored right now, and I think I'm going to have to find something to do today in the afternoon. I'm going to see if I can't get a job somewhere so I can go see A Perfect Circle in concert. That'd be awesome. I know someone else who'd like to go with me to so I'd have to ask them, muwahahaha. Anyways, I'm bored, and can't think of anything else to write, so...Peace."

Anyhoo, here goes:

Set in motion, minds are bent
towards the thought of tranquility
Mine eyes open in revolation

what I must do to hold what we've made
Sacrifices must be completed
ere these blastphemus days continue
much like the quarrels where both leave beaten
hasten towards a peaceful revolution

time will meld these days ahead
Try as I do I become unsteady
waverying towards impossible goals
selfless, selfishness
I give myself unto this cause
Improve the land of life and death
strengthen bond between our spirits

Hatred, fear, anger collapse
only to be respun again
weave the good into the bad
let the spirits cry out in hunger
for death to stop, peace to last
cease the endlessness of disorder"

"event","Well  I was feeling inspired by some things I read on www.toolband.com today, and so I decided to write a religious song. Obviously, it's about my dislike for the teachings of christianity and what it stands for if you delve into the true thoughts behind the ""Disiples"" and Jesus. Don't take this as I hate christans, because I don't. What would be the use of that? Most poeple I know are christan and I've gotten my ass kicked for being Wiccan so what's the point of saying that Christians are bad people. So, in other words, if you think there's a possibility you'll be offended by any of this, don't read it. And if you do anyways, don't come complaining to me, because I frankly don't want to hear about your christan stuff. I've heard enough of it, know enough, and will keep learning until I know all I can. BUT, I just don't want to hear people saying, ""Christianity isn't at all like that, you're a terrible person, you should die,"" and the such. It's my views, if you don't like them, don't tell me about it unless you're actually a coherent speaker and know a little about it. I don't exactly like having conversations with ""sheep,"" because they always think they're right. So whatever. I haven't thought of a name for this, and it's probobly not even done yet. If I think of more, I'll add it in here. So here it is:

Waiting for my time to end
Pools of stagnant thoughts that bend
Around my mind, this sacred place
of hellspun thoughts that keep the pace
of a wonderous haven where our spirits shall fall
upon the golden paths of this supposed Gods halls

Lie to me now, oh once and again
these chapels of killing and falsehood decend
upon legions of deamons, hungry to feed
your God looks away and watches you die
Piercing screams cry as you take a last breath
And life flickers away as the clock strikes your death

Preach to us now, oh holy one
sing to us of perverted prophet, the Son
Kill in the name of God to satisfy his thirst
Plagues this here haven which He created first
Send us this Holy Child of yours, watch him crucified
Not a chill in your bones, we rise and reply

Lies fill my mind, oh once and again
these preachers of killing and falsehood decend
to the pits of your hell, into deamonic grasp
hope that you like the enternal fast
Piercing screams cry as teeth sink into skin
Suffering your curse, you created your own sins"

"event","No, this isn't about me crying (which I do plenty of in my spare time.) It's another feeble attempt of lyricism by myself. I dubbed it Storm of Tears. That name is subject to change. I could think of different ones right now. Here it is:

Storm of Tears

Unbound hearts decend to earth
Light surrounds their bodies
Angles sent down from above
Guardians of our sacred love

Faithful to thy souls before
Seperate minds and bodies
Would there be a purer form
Show us of thy caring

The winds of time change direction
Cloudless skies turn black
And faith-less-ness a-wakes!

Fire explodes upon open grounds
Raging the ocean's upon you
Lightning pours down from Heaven above
Igniting the faithfulness once in your hands
Setting my work to shame
Letting it die in the fires below
Never will I be the same

The tears from my eyes are a blessing to the land
But the downpour from this cloud won't cease
This flood of love and hate from my eyes
Created this storm of tears
They set out the fires that burn in this land
But never again will I feel

Clouded mind
Darkened heart
Confusion, tear myself apart
It's not my fault
Your to blame
Somehow I know that I'll al-ways feel this way

The waters calm down
The lightning has ceased
Thunder remains but fades to the East
The heavens above sing their mournful song
Rains drift away from my darkened face
Though I still don't feel I've regained my place

Pick me up don't let me go
Help me get on through
Shadows have encompassed me
Make my soul renewed

Skies are clear
Land is dry
The storm of tears has pass on by
Seemingly gone for a time until then
Brewing inside until nee-ded again


If you ask me, it doesn't make sence. I wrote it yesterday, posted it on my Open Diary and yeah. I read it again, and it seems like there's too many hidden meanings that only I would find. But it's wierd, and could end up being something. Maybe trash. Who knows. Somewhere in all of that crap though, I'll find the time to write simple keyboard, bass, guitar parts, and a nice long solo that will fit well. Harmonizing the vocals will be nice too. I get to do it all on my own to. How fun. No band, no one to do stuff for you. I guess that's what I get. Oh well. Goodnight everyone."

"event","I've definantly been bored lately. Which, of course is the reason that I just pulled out the keyboard and have started teaching myself how to play. I learned how to play Vacant, by Dream Theater. It's all piano and vocals. Hard for me to play, even though Jess would laugh at me for saying it's hard. It's like seven chords though, and yeah, I just started. But so far, I learned how to play probobly thirteen or so chords with my left hand, and the right hand is pretty much screwed. It's not cooporating at all. Disappointing, but I'll just have to break it off if it won't work properly, haha. The week went by really slowly, as far as school went. More like classes, because inbetween in the halls was a whole lot of fun for me. I think I was late to most of my classes just because I walked someone to her classes. Other then that, I can't even think of anything really. Natalie is in New Jersey visiting some college that her sister is going to attend next year. I hope she got there and gets back safely. Everyone seemed to do stuff with people this weekend except for me though. Me...I went out to Hunan Palace and saw Secret Window with my parents. Fun stuff huh? That movie was awesome, and the dinner was shweet too. I love Asian food, and Asian culture, and Asian anything. So yeah. Anyhow, I'm drawing another blank, so I think I'll leave. Hopefully there will be something going on today, otherwise I'll go insane. Farewell."

"event","I've been out of it lately, but it's definantly a good ""out of it"" type of mood. Most of you know why, but the ones that don't know why...I guess you won't know because you obviously care too little to ask, haha. I have been a bit too lazy to update this. Frankly, I don't think anyone but three people read this (thanks Sagar, Alex, and Matt) but I keep it up anyways for the ""breaking news."" Well, this weeks breaking news is going to be kept on the down-low/low-down, for reasons that remain disclosed to public viewing :P But Friday was great, and so was Saturday, though it could have been like the coolest day in Salisbury yet. Went to the rock show that night and it was pretty good. There was a techno band there. They played funky crap that no one but myself really liked, haha. I was suppose to go to a party afterwards but no one gave me a ride, and after I couldn't get a ride, I frankly didn't want to go anymore. So, I called my parents to have them pick me up, waited out in the cold for about twenty minutes (it was below freezing with a strong breeze,) and then came home and chatted with Natalie :) Apparently her mom was being not nice that night and wouldn't let her go to the rock show or the party. Poo on her. That would have been rad to the four thousandth power. Sunday blew the big one. When I say the big one, I mean the big one. Monday was good. Actually it was great. I was all bubbly and effervescent. Again, disclosed reasons. And I was the same today. It's going to be a good week I can tell. St. Patrick's day is tomorrow and I wore the only piece of clothing with green on it the day before...how smart of me. I noticed tonight just before I started typing this, that I have very very large dark spots under my eyes. Lack of sleep. It's killing me. My eyes are always bloodshot now and the dark circles under my eyes are very unattractive, even though they make my eyes look darker and more mysterious. Apparently today I had two different eye colours. I wish I could have seen. One was a dark blue and the other a lighter blue (or so they all said.) I was like, ""Shweeeet, that's messed up and I'm lovin' it!"" I've been playing guitar. I have to relearn all of The Glass Prison by Dream Theater. I learned it wrong, and now I'm paying for it. It's the only song of theirs that I cannot play, and it's really disturbing me. I'll have some of it by the end of the week. Unlearning what you already know is impossibly hard. I don't know what else to say, so I'll say goodnight, and sweet dreams to everyone."

"event","My day was soooooooo so awesome. I have no complaints whatsoever. None at all, about anyone (aside from the parents) or anything. First off, I got to sleep in for half an hour. Second, I got to skip first second and third periods to go to VPA. So at VPA I talked with Lauren and Pierce and Chris, met Mary and had an awesome time. I've never been so motivated to do work in my life. The teachers didn't tell them to do anything, they just work, and it caught up to me and I wanted to work soo badly. Went back to school after that, and skipped lunch for the day. Wasn't hungry. Fifth period I talked to Chris in Engineering. In the halls between fifth and sixth, I talked to Nat for like a minute. That was cool. And then Art was good. Oh, and at VPA, Lauren and them were using a term I had never heard. It was ""Poon."" So now thanks to Lauren, Pierce, Mary, and Heather, I now know what a ""poon"" is. That you all. I'm scared for life, haha. After school I played guitar, and Liz IMs me, and then lo and behold, Natalie IMs me. As if my day wasn't good enough. Doubley better. Eating girlscout cookies and talking to Natalie online. Cool huh? Haha, I thought so. After that though nothing happened. My parents are complaining and stressing about my grades. Why do they care at all? They're MY grades not theirs. Whatever, it's not like they're horrible. I'm spacing right now so I'll post again tomorrow. Peace and love everyone. Goodnight."

All I have to say is something was fucking in my room and I got no sleep last night. Today was boring though, mainly because I was so tired. Nothing happened at all. I got home...and nothing happened. I finished painting a Cold One (for all of you warhammer fans out there) and it looks quite dandy if you ask me. Played guitar, and wrote a crazy ass prog-rock song on electric. The first good song I've wrote on electric in a long while. That made me happy. I just jammed on that forever, made like four solos in it and all that jank. I didn't pull out the keyboard unfortunantly. I've been wanting to learn how to play. Oh well. Called Alex, which made my day, and talked to her. She touched Davy's leg at the AFI concert, Davy being the singer or something. Someone that was in the band. And while she was crowdsurfing, he pointed at her and the spotlight fell on her and stuff. So her life is now complete. I'm happy for her. She said she's coming up with Jessica this summer. I can't wait. I can't stand this place any longer. I'm going to have them kidnap me, haha. I need to finish my drawing of Alex for art. She's very gorgeous, and it really shows in this picture if you ask me. Hopefully I won't screw it up. Peace."

Then, on the way there, I realize that Alex (my awesome friend that lives in Florida) had gone to a Thursday and AFI concert the night before (on thursday night) and that she was going to a Linkin Park concert tonight (friday night.) Yeah, that sort of dropped my highness down, especially since my parents won't let me go to Dream Theater's concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington D.C. on the twenty-ninth of March. But Friday was sweet. The bands were good, the company was better, and I just had a really great time. Thanks to everyone. Saturday was not so good. The day sucked, and so did the night. I sat pretty much by myself the whole time at the Finals of Battle of the Bands and was quite pissed off. You know, one of those depressed, angry, lonely and bored moods that combine together into a hidious array of evilness? Yeah, that was me tonight. It's gone now, and thank the gods for that, but it's the fact that I was in the mood that makes me sad. I've gone brain dead and can't think of anything to say, other then go check out www.michaelkelsey.com and download the new songs on the homepage. They're awesome. Actually, just skip getting the song Sarah, and go for Skat. That's WAY better if you ask me. Anways, if you download them, enjoy. I'm out, peace."

"event","I just looked over my artwork that I kept for my portfolio. It seems a little...sparce. The work is decent, but too little of it. I need to do three pieces of art in a month, and have them look magnificent. The one I really want to do is a picture of a left foot kicking the upper half of a skateboard to have it heelflip. The board would be in half rotation and the foot out. Is that gay or would it really be cool? That and a guitar that slowely turns into a keyboard or some other instrument. Maybe a man playing a saxophone that bends and turns into a guitar. I don't know, something abstract like that.
Today, I woke up and the funny thing was is that immediatly I thought, ""I hope Lauren and Heather get to go horseback riding today."" I really hope they got to though. I know how people don't keep in touch with each other during college, and it really kills me. I hope those two do, and if they don't, I hope they'll at least have days like this (if they went) to look back upon and smile. I applied for three jobs today. I'll have to see how those go. Wrote yet another song, and this one is even more lyric friendly. I'm sort of vacant right now and can't think at all. Hence the Dream Theater song as the subject of today's post (Vacant.) So I'm going to go chill my brain to some Dream Theater. Hope everyone's day off was great. Peace and love. Goodnight."

Well that was interesting. Most of those songs I didn't know I even had on my computer. I guess that's what you get for having four thousand, one hundred fifty-eight songs on your computer. I can thank my awesome brother for most of those. But today was entirely pointless, as far as school goes. No homework, no schoolwork, no nothing. Just pure, dumb, boring, tiring...yeah. Anyways. After school was skate session galore. My street session consisted of two good lines, and countless other good tricks. The first was such: Nollie kickflip, Nollie backside 180, switch kickflip, fakie treflip, and finally, a fakie backside flip. I was stunned at myself. I didn't know I had it in me. Especially with new shoes. The other line was as follows: Switch kickflip, fakie backside heelflip, kickflip, heelflip, and then I feel quite nicely onto my bottom. Yes, very nice. I relearned backside flips, learned frontside flips, nollie frontside 180's, and landed a few of the following: Nollie treflips, hardflips, nollie heelflips, switch heelflips, heelflip grabs (grabbing indy, roastbeef, mute, and stalefish,) and I heelflipped to indied off of a curb that was about a two set high and continued over a small gap (around three feet in length.) And I almost forgot the nice little freestyle touches I added. Crossfooted truckstands, truckstands, truckstands to fingerflip out, fingerflips, double fingerflips, can-can truckstands, rail flips, godzilla rail flips, cooper flips, and I even almost landed a butter flip. Those and the returned trick I seem to have dubbed my own (a fakie nosehook big underflip) were fairly consistent. I don't do caspers too often anymore, mainly because they're useless and dumb looking (unless you're doing sidewinders.) Handstands now illude me. Not skating and not doing pushups really seem to have taken their toll on that trick. I'll get it back though. Onto the rail session. I managed to switch boardslide it a couple times, crook it, nosegrind it, and even overcrook it once. Bluntslides were on today. I bluntslid at least half of the rail, and never once did I not land the ones that I tried. I need to get kickflip to bluntslides back though, and need to finish learning treflips to frontside nosebluntslides. Those would be ultimate. Salads are also a constant trick. They're really just an accident created by not getting into bluntslide, but they slide nicely so I like them and do them a lot.
Tomorrow we have the day off. Elections. Interesting yes? No. I hate not having school, even though I hate school. It's ironic isn't it? After skating, I did vertually nothing. Watched a movie, then picked up the guitar. Immediatly I just play what was on my mind, and behold, I wrote another song on acoustic guitar. This one is more meant to have lyrics to it, which is a nice break from the eternal jamming that I have been doing in my songs lately. Now I just need to sit down and write some. I really need to get down to Virginia though. To skate, see people, film, play guitar. You name it, I want to do it down there. Barret wants some footage of me for their video that is going to be released sometime soon hopefully. They have a bit, but I'm a pretty fluid skater and could put up some good footage in a short ammount of time. His website, if anyone is interested, is at http://www.swanpoop.topcities.com/ There's a picture of me doing a Can-Can 50-50 Truckstand in the ""Others"" section. The actual footage was of me switching feet onto the truck that I'm standing on. I believe I switched my feet five or six times. I also believe that was the day I before I moved. Sad...but Dream Theater is coming to D.C. on the twenty-ninth of March. Yes, this month. I'm getting tickets, as is everyone else. At least, I better be getting tickets. I'll die if I don't. The Crystal Method is also going to be in D.C. on the first of April I think. Either the first or the second. That'd be sweet too. But Dream Theater would be amazing, as would be seeing all of my Virginia friends there. I can't really think about anything else right now though aside from skating, so I'm going to go so I don't talk everyone's ears off even more about stuff you don't know about. Peace."

                       ~Mel Gibson (William Wallace in Braveheart)~

I wonder how many of you are like that. You'll live, yes, but you'll never get to actually live the life you have. You'll go along and try to fit in everywhere you are. The cloths, the way you act, everything changes for a few individuals, and so you get raised higher (or lower sometimes) on the social heiarchy. Is it worth it? Is it worth sitting on your death bed, and wishing you'd made a different choice, a choice that would have changed the rest of your life? For God's sake people, give yourselves freedom from the bonds that hold you down, and live the life you've been given! It's not worth having to cower in fear, to live under someone else, or to deny your own beliefs just to be accepted for the rest of your life. If only you would all open your eyes and see, realize what's before you. We've been given the world, and yet for the most part, many of us strive to be someone else. This sure as hell is not what I want for myself. I've been given the world, and I do not shrink down and live on it...I hold it in my hands, and the rest of us should do the same, for once we are free of what binds us down, we can achieve anything, but until then, you will only walk in someone elses shadows."

"event","Week was uninteresting until Art II on thursday. Heather comes in after talking to Lauren in the hall, and was like, ""Lauren wants me to give you her number."" I'm thinking, what the hell for, so I ask her why, and the responce comes, ""Well...So you can talk to Natalie."" Hahaha, and the truth comes out. She could have just told me that to begin with. But being a girl, she has to play around with my mind for a bit before telling me anything. So yeah. Later on in Art, Heather told me she'd bring pictures of her boyfriend Andy to school so I could actually see who this dude is. So Friday comes, and Heather didn't bring Lauren's phone number (which is okay because I'd rather ask Natalie for it anyways) but she did bring all of the pictures of her boyfriend, which is ironic because at lunch, I went to say hi to Heather at the ""Spirit Cart"" and lo and behold, there stands Andy. I go up and I'm like, ""You must be Andy. I'm Aaron, nice to meet you man,"" and shake his hand and all. Next period as I'm walking in the halls, Heather is like, ""you and me need to talk."" I'm thinking, uh oh what'd I do? Andy want me dead or something? I find out in art that I had totally confused Andy by saying ""You must be Andy."" I had to go on and explain that I could tell it was her boyfriend by the way he looks at her and so on. I don't think she understood too well but she thought it was cute anyways, haha. That night, Jen picks me up and we go to Parkside's Battle of the Bands, which was totally rigged. Liz and Natalie (yes, that natalie) saved us seats and we all chilled. Everyone was there...aside from the Parkside people. Sandbox Bullies and their little offshoot band won 2nd and 3rd place, which if you ask me, Letter 5 should have definantly won second, with Sandbox Bullies winning 3rd. The 1st place band was awesome though. So yeah. But Natalie and Liz had to leave early, due to Natalie having to get to her Dad's for the weekend. I really thought it was cute how Jen called Liz over and they started to whisper, and then they get up and leave, and while I'm watching them go to ""the bathroom"" (yeah whatever, lol) Jen gives me a wink, which definantly hinted at ""talk to the girl man, she's yours for a few minutes."" Now I'm bad at that stuff, but I tried to anyways. Not so sure how well it went but I learned some stuff about her. Which is always a good thing. After Battle of the Bands, we went to TCBY and everyone was there. Then Jen drove me home and I wrote another instrumental song on my acoustic guitar afterwards. I'm getting really good at that. I can get beats and all going with a rhythm and bass line (well almost a bass line) and guitar part at the same time. I need to figure out which ones to add lyrics too though. I could definantly get along with only acoustic guitar, no band. So saturday I woke up at one thirty, took a shower, listened to some music, then went outside and skated. I have new shoes that I haven't skated in yet so it was interesting, yet I did a sweet line. Nollie bs 180, switch kickflip, switch bs 180, kickflip, heelflip, and then I fell over doing, of all things, a manual. Yeah, and I'm like the manual/nosemanual master. Fruity huh? Went to the mall because my dad made me. He had to get a hair cut. I saw Jen and Liz there. That was cool. Came back home after eating at Chili's, played Warcraft III and then watched Mortal Kombat. And that is about it my friends. Oh, I forgot that I played the two acoustic instrumental songs that I wrote. Isn't that crazy?!? I actually remembered them! I was so happy with myself. It's nothing too special, because they aren't really formed songs. I mean, I've got like a part that acts like a verse, and one like a chorus, and another like a bridge, and then a solo, and I can fill in with funky beats on the guitar and anything else within' reach of my hands or feat. But it was sweet, I was just jamming and had no sence of time. It was a seeming endless flow of goodness that was a harmony of mathimatical equations. So yeah. I can't wait for Bennet's Battle of the Bands. Two nights, should be sweet. As for me, I stayed up for two nights this week and am tired for no apparent reason. So I shall try to update this more often, but I have no promesis for you. Once I get out skating more I will though. This is a place to announce my new findings in skating and my success, so yeah. Peace out everyone."

I've been listening to a ton of Counting Crows lately. All of their CDs in fact, except for their live double CD that they released in 1998. I don't own that one. For those of you who don't know them, get to. They're amazing, no matter what type of music you like. But this song really caught my attention. It's off of their album Recovering the Satellites, and is called ""Have You Seen Me Lately?"" I started thinking about it while I was at the rock show Friday night. And I thought to myself, ""How am I going to be when I have a record deal and am touring across America, or skating in competitions."" I would hope I wouldn't change too much, and if I do a lot, I hope it's for the best. I know I'm going to do one or the other. Guitar/singing or skateboarding. It's in me. I have what it takes, and I will take dire measures to make sure I get to where I need to be. If you ask me, I deserve it, but I know some of you out there will disagree with that, but that's only because you think I'm a freak. Get to know me, then call me a freak. But I'm still thinking about it. It almost worries me, because what if I change so badly that I'm unrecignizable to my friends anymore. How gay would that be? That'd devastate me, it'd devastate my friends, and everything would be fucked up. Not like minorly fucked, way majorly fucked.
     Anyways, I'm picking out pictures to draw faces of. I think I'm doing Eddy Vedder and Adam Duritz. Eddy Vedder is lead singer of Pearl Jam, and Adam Duritz is lead singer of Counting Crows. It is however a possibility to do someone from Dream Theater, such as James LaBrie, or John Petrucci, but I'm not positive if I have good pictures of them. I'll have to check. Maybe if Alex's letter get to me in the mail I can draw a picture of her. How hott would that be? Well you wouldn't know so I'll tell you. That'd be like out of this world hott. She sent me a letter with some pictures and I'm excited, I'll have to call her when I get them. I've been playing a lot of acoustic guitar, and lyrics have been coming to me like left and right along with guitar, beats, and bass to accompany them while I sing. And the best part is is that I can play them all and sing the lyrics at the time. That mean....Anyone? Solo career. I don't get along with people and a solo career would probobly be best for me. Requires more skill, but I've got a good deal of that to last me long enough so I shant be worrying about that for now. I am however still stuck on the idea of a Progressive-rock/metal group. Just sounds awesome to me. Oh well.
    My week equiled poo until Thursday afternoon in English class where someone told me something that should have pissed me off but made me laugh so hard I had tears in my eyes. It was great. Friday I went to the rock show. Downtown Singapor is awesome, and so is Linux. Linux makes me wonder though. Why did they use the name of an OS (Operating System for those of you who are computer illiterate) for their band? Oh well, doesn't matter. I saw some people there. I was greatful to see them, though I'm not sure if they'd say the same to me. Two didn't look exactly exstatic about it. But I just chilled by myself anyways, like I always do. Yeah, I'm a lone wolf. Always have been, always will be. Get over it.
   Saturday was sweet. I did nothing until about six o'clock that night, where then I went to pick up Ashley to go see the Rock and Roll Revival show. She'd already been to it but said she'd go again. As usual, she was glowing. That and the combined poweress of the show was shweet. The show was great. Everyone did an awesome job in it. I don't care how much you hate me, you were all sweet in it. The hard work paid off. After that, took Ashley home, returned home myself, and watched the Runaway Jury. An excelent movie. Go rent it....Now. 
    Today was dumb. Had to go to a neighbor's for lunch. Great lunch, great people, but we had to walk to their house, and the fields have just been saturated with chicken manure. Yes, for those of you in Virginia, it smells like shit outside all the time. That was about all I did. So yeah, I'm going to go listen to some music and pick out some pictures. Hope I get Alex's letter tomarrow. Anyways, peace and love. Fairwell everyone."

"event","People seem stressed lately. I think we all need to go out, smoke a blunt and listen to some Phish. I'm sick of being stressed over nothing. And, if I'm not mistaken, EVERYONE else is stressed too. So if anyone wants to take me up on that one, feel free to tell me. Though I might die if I smoke weed for the first time. It'd probobly drop out of the blunt and I'd choke on it, hahahaha. Which of course is why I don't smoke anyways. I'd rather not get onto that topic though. Tonight I called Gabby. She's doing great. We talked for an hour, and it was joyous. After that I listened to my new Dave Matthew's Band CD. I love that band, so much talent. And now I checked my journal. Yes, I need a life, but I'm too lazy to call people to do anything and not many people really want to do anything with me anyways. Being a hermit is fun for a while but it gets old. I wrote an all acoustic song today, meant to be played by only one guitar. It has a bass, rhythm and lead guitar part throughout almost the whole thing that I can play all at the same time. Tomorrow I'll figure out where to put beats on my guitar to give it more rhythm and more of a personality. Yes, songs do have personality, most people just don't take the time to put one in. I'm off now, off to read the Salmarillion and listen to Michael Kelsey. Again, check out the two songs on his homepage. www.michaelkelsey.com You might like it. Sweet dreams to all. Goodnight."

"event","Wow, I'd be lying if I didn't have something to say right now. BUT, apparently I have offended ""someone"" (like it's a big mystery who) and so I won't post any more of my thoughts on society for a while. Disappointing yes? Not really, I was getting sick of complaining about it. Hopefully they (more like she) come to an understanding on what I meant about it all. Their comment and my own reply are in the last posting I had if anyones interested in reading or posting a comment of their own. Hopefully we can get some coherent discussion going, but probobly not. People are short ended on these journal things. However at least it is getting people to think. Whether they think I'm right or wrong, it doesn't matter because I don't care what they think. I do my own thing. But at least they're thinking. I haven't posted in a while so I'll tell you about the weekend.

Friday, I get back from school, skate for three hours nonstop, come inside and check my journal for comments, as usual. And look what I find, but an invitation to go to Vans Skatepark with two of my friends. Lo and behold, something new. This changed the entire plans of my weekend, praise the gods. So I stay up till three thirty in the morning, go to sleep after talking to a bunch of people, watching BladeII, and drinking four liters of pop (soda for all of you southerners, haha.) Waking up at eight, I shower, shake the hair into place, dress, brush, gather my stuff, and hop in the car and get headed on the way to Vans. Vans is located in Potomac Mills Mall in Virginia, and is about a three hour drive from here in Maryland. I get there, get a pass for the twelve o'clock session, find Matt and Kevin, put on pad, and go skate. I'm telling you what, that was awesome. Matt and Kevin had to leave before I landed it, but I landed a backside crooked and a backside boardslide down the rail. I was so stoked I couldn't even tell anyone in words. Took another three hours to drive back here, and I just sort of collapsed into this chair here. I'm still sore from that session and the session on friday. I played a lot of guitar. I told myself that I was going to write more lyrics but I never got myself too worked up about it and didn't bother in the end. Saturday night, my brother, his fionce and one of his fellow employees at Arksan call and ask me a bunch of questions about Lord of the Rings. I'm pretty much the loremaster for all of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies in case anyone cared to know. So I answer his questions, aside from one to which I now know the answer to. Sunday was excruciatingly painful. My muscles were sore Saturday night, but nothing compared to on Sunday morning. I could barely roll out of bed, and we had to go to church. I wouldn't mind going to church if it wasn't so early. I honestly learn decent things while listening to the preacher's sermons sometimes, and if I don't, then at least I know more about the Bible so I'm not completely ignorant of other religions. Afterwards I drove to Circuit City and picked up Final Fantasy: The Crystal Chronicals for the Nintendo Game Cube. Awesome game. I then asked if CC was hiring, and they said they were next month. Cool, I could potencially get a job. Came back home, played my game. And then I played a ton of Michael Kelsey songs on guitar. I've been thinking about entering Battle of the Bands by myself, just playing Michael Kelsey stuff, but apparently that wouldn't be a good idea, because not many people like acoustic music here. Not many I know anyways. Tori, Pierce, Randi, Maggy and the bunch love punk/emo and rock music, and most of the other people like the same. Now, if they heard Michael Kelsey stuff, they might like it, but definantly not the first time. Everyone would be more confused if they heard it for the first time at Battle of the Bands. It'd be like, ""What the hell is this? It's really good but I don't really quite get it."" So I think I'm going to skip that idea until maybe next year. For everyone that reads this, I implore you to go to www.michaelkelsey.com and download the two songs on the homepage. Satisfaction Guarunteed and Cult of Personality. They're only about six hundred kilobytes so even for a 56k modem that would only take about a minute or two for each. They're amazing. If you do like the songs, you can either buy a CD off of his site (I recommend Gruvency) or I can get my brother to hook you up with some if you tell me. It'll cost you but you won't have to pay shipping. If Kelsey sees that people on the east coast are buying his CD's, he'll come tour here, and how cool would that be? That'd be a dream for me. Anyways, about my Monday. I did nothing. Didn't play guitar, didn't sing barely at all. I'm going to play guitar later but didn't feel like it earlier. Hopefully something's going on tonight. Maybe I'll call Gabby, Ashley, and Lindsey. I need to see how they're doing. It's been a while since I've checked up on them. For now, peace and love. Farewell to all."

"event","Why do people have to change? It really kills me to know that I am one of 123980217398 people that will always be there for everyone, keep an open mind, and not backstab people. It seems that all my friends have it happen to them all the time, or they do it to me so often that it doesn't even register anymore. What the fuck is up with that? Do you people have any idea how wrong that is? Wrong on so many levels. Not only are you being a basterd/bitch, you're being rude, simple minded, and unintelligent at the same time. How convinient for me. It makes it easy for myself to point out your flaws, which of course I really hate doing. If you'd all just stop chosing who your friends are and be friends with everyone, I wouldn't have to keep posting crap like this. Apparently I've been forgotten by some of my friends. And how ironic that the people that have forgotten me are the ones here in Salisbury, not the ones back in Richmond. I've been left alone and fogotten by the people that live in my own city, and remembered by the people that live four hours away from me. At least I know I made a lasting impression on some people, that I was a good friend. Apparently I still am. Shweet. Onto my day...

'Twas quite excelent if you ask me. Everyone was running around asking everyone about Winter Formal. For those of you in Richmond, Winter Formal is the dinky little dance they have here that everyone dresses up for. ""Are you going?"" they'd say, thinking I'm going to go ""have fun"" at their stupid dance. ""No,"" comes the reply from my glum face. ""Well why not?"" is their immediate answer. ""Because I'd rather not get depressed again and feel more lonely then I already do."" That answer seemed to knock people off of their feet, because I still haven't found anyone that actually made a decent responce to it. Haha. So while everyone was out having ""fun"" preparing and going to Winter Formal, I was out skating amazingly. Three full hours with only a fifteen minute break. All that I can say is wow, I'm exhausted, but jubilant. I landed so many tricks. Nollie heelflips (a trick I tried to land for two and a half hours yesterday to no avail,) bluntslides, crookeds with a heelflip out, nosegrinds, smiths, salads, tre flips, switch kickflips, 180's here and there. And my most proud moments of the day were my two heelflip to stalefishes and my sloppy nollie tre flip. Heelflip to stalefish people. On flatground. Crazy. I'm finally use to my new deck, so I can possibly heelflip close to five decks. This gave me a tad bit more time so that I was able to do the stalefish grab cleaner. Unknowing, Mister Hammond had left me a message telling me to meet him and Mister Martin at Vans skatepark in Potomac Mills, Virginia tomorrow. And now I officially ache. Tough luck huh? My parents origionally had planned for us (us meaning them dragging me behind) to go to Rehobeth, but I strategically convinced them to take me to Vans. How sweet yes? My parents are also concidering letting me go snowboarding with Sagar. That would be awesome. I've never been snowboarding and miss skating with him dearly, so it would be a double treat for me. So I haven't gotten a chance to write down any lyrics. I've been lazy really, that's the only excuse. I've had so many different versions playing in my head that I could make an entire CD out of the same lyrics. So I don't know what else to write. Just be friends with everyone okay? Don't chose your friends, and especially don't ignore them after you befriend them. That's worse then a stab in the back. Peace to all. And Happy Valentines Day (Also Known As the lonliest day of the year.) I almost forgot that."

"event","Sleep still has not been coming, but all is no longer lost. I've had the makings of more lyrics in my head lately, and more songs written on guitar that I've actually kept. Ironically, I got the lyrics from a daydream, where everything was backwards. Night was day, dark was light, black was white and so on. I say it was ironic, because the last time I drempt and saw it in my sleep was a year or two ago. I quite like it all though. Daydreaming is much more fun anyways. I get more use out of the day then I would if I was a normal human. Four or five hours of sleep rocks compared to eight, althought I do get drowzy quite often. I wouldn't change anything right now though. I'm that well off. Well, I don't have any money, but I'm still extraordinarily joyous for no apparent reason. I wish other people were. I wish people would get their heads out of their asses sometimes too and notice people like my dear friend and I. She works her ass off to be everyone's friend and make everyone feel good and I feel that she gets nothing in return. Not fair, I know, but the same happens to me. I've been blessed with lonliness, what can I say. It's made me a better person though, as hard as that is to believe. I see things in ways that most everyone else wouldn't even bother to try to figure out. Points of view, problems, solutions, you name it, I see it differently then the average person. Which brings me to my next point. Religion....Bad topic I know, but I just realized while reading the Salmarillion, by J.R.R. Tolkien, that any joe shmoe with a literary and theological degree could create their own religion. Tolkien did. He made a religion for the Elves. It's quite remarkable too. But why is it that people believe in the new religions like Christianity. I'd personally rather go with Judaism if I wanted to worship one god. After all it's older. Wouldn't that make it more right? Oh, but I forgot. No one got killed by people that didn't understand things. It makes no sence to me why people are so obsessive about religion. I personally believe in Wicca but I don't think that all other religions are wrong. In the back of my mind, there's the part of me saying that gods don't exist. We're here and that's that. Someone's going to beat the hell out of me for saying this also, but Christianity and Satanism are the same thing. Without one, the other wouldn't exist. It's that easy. The Trinity and Satan are all gods, and different people worship them. Both religions believe in the other, but they hate each other. Give it up and join together. Get a common cause people. If Christianity's god was so loving, then why'd he banish Lucifer? I'll tell you why. Power. Only he can be god, no one else. It's so fruity if you ask me. Oh, and these are opinions mind you. Shout and yell all you want, it won't change much. Hopefully I can make others think a different way about it. I don't want to changes peoples' beliefs, I want them to actually think, not just sit there and nod their heads at whatever is said to them. My days are irrelivant now, and few to come so I'm not going to bother with telling you about them unless something fun and amazing happens. A girlfriend maybe? Or maybe when people stop sniffing their own asses and look up and aknowledge me and everyone else around them. Tough one. As for now, I'm off to read the Salmarillion. After that, I'll be dreaming in a sleepless state of unknowing and all knowing. Goodnight to all."

But I'm not afraid of being alone, because I always have been. I'm happy with myself so why bother worrying? I'm no longer frightened of my friends getting hurt. I sure as hell will be worried but they can take care of themselves...most of them. Some of them I'll always have to take care of, and they'll never realize that I'm helping them. It's good to know I do some good though around here. People have scared me in their own little way. I'm definantly a peoples sorta person, but I don't think I'll every be comfortable around them. Especially large groups. There's something about that that just makes me naucious. Guitar and skateboarding. Now there are two things that I've feared I wasn't good at since I started doing them. Screw that. I gave it up and, not to sound cocky in any way, am probobly better at them both then most will ever be at one. I guess it's just a reality check for me. There's no use in being afraid when I could die in ten minutes. What's the point in not living my life. The only thing to fear, is fear itself, and how true is that?

My day was fruitay in the bootay. I had to stop updating this at around eleven thirty last night because I'm not suppose to be on the computer that late. Haha. So it's February the sixth and I'm talking about February the fifth. Cool huh? Like I said, the day was dumb. Certain people ignoring me again. But hell, all they are losing is my respect. I'll always be there for them, but they probobly won't think of me until I'm the last person they have, and then they'll feel horrible about it all. Ironic isn't it? I didn't do anything today either (February sixth, not fifth.) Oh, I saw Lauren in the halls. Lauren is major coolio. I swear, she's so much like Angela, it makes me sad, but happy that there are other people as cool as Angela is. I can't think of anything else to write. I just hope there's something to do this weekend. It'd be boring if there wasn't. Peace and love to all."

Yet again, I became invisible during all the hours of the day, except seventh period. There I get to talk to Heather, who always seems to make my day. If only Lauren had been there too. I miss her dearly. But, the thing I felt different this morning was something a little better then knowing I was to be seen through by people today. Actually, it was a lot better.  For the first time since a time I cannot and am unable to remember, I'm genuinely happy with my life. I think that last time I was truely happy was during fourth or fifth grade. That seems a little long of a time to be pissed off at everything and everyone, but I managed to do it. Something in my mind must have come into focus last night before I fell asleep (which was at 2:45 or so,) probobly while I was listening to Dream Theater, because I felt an easing of my entire body. Great feeling. It was much nicer to be happy with myself during the day then to keep wishing I was six feet under, which is my usual thinking pattern. People were being gay and not noticing anyone today, including myself, so that pissed me off. But, I didn't let it get in my way of being happy so it sort of got canceled out. Apparently only people from Virginia and Florida (Love ya Alex, you're a sweetheart) read my last post, because no one in Maryland paid any attention to what I said. Disappointing...

Today was gay, but I'm finally happy as mentioned above. School is stupid. I wish I could drop out without getting beat over the head by my parents. I wish I could also tell them that I am Wiccan without them making such a huge deal out of it. They'd either call me shit or try to get me ""help."" Help is the last thing I need. I think I might freak a shrink out with all the crap that goes on in my head. I'd almost like to have the chance....Almost. I played guitar, sang and painted tonight. Guitar...whoa, I do not mean to be cocky, but this will sound like I am. But damn, I was on a roll tonight. I played almost every song off of Images and Words (Dream  Theater album) to near perfection. It was quite beauitful. Singing. Well I tested my limits and outdid myself. I didn't know I could sing that high and still keep a good tone and a vibrado going. On top of that, I can finally regulate my breathing such that I can sing for a long time, and then belt out a massivly long held note at a high pitch. Pretty nifty huh? More like gnarly! And painting. Oh dear god. I paint models (figurines, not bikini models) for those of you who didn't know. Have to assemble them and crap. Well anyways, I thought I'd be crafty and replace a dudes' spear arm with a large sword that would look totally wicked. Well, the spear and arm are all one metal piece, and the sword has a hand connected to it. So I pull out the modeling knife which is as dull as my dads hair, and go to cutting off the spear from the arm, and the hand from the sword. Each one of those took around twenty minutes to get cut properly, and by then, my entire hand hurt from the force I had to use on it. Piece of shit. Then, even worse, the pieces refused to glue together nicely and I had to set up this whole system of vices and crap to get them all to glue together. The glue is finally drying now so I'm happy, but my poor hand isn't. Some totally wicked painted models can be found on http://us.games-workshop.com/games/warhammer/darkelves/catalog/cold_one_knights.htm
Check it out. They're wierd but nifty. Anyways, I'm off to wait for sleep while listeing to music. Sweet dreams and sleep well everyone. Peace and love."

But it really pissed me off throughout the whole day. Even worse, I said ""Hey"" to a ton of people in the halls today, and it's like everyone's out to ignore me now. Not the best feeling in the world, and of all days, today was definantly the worst it has ever felt. Something was up with everyone today, or maybe it was just myself. Maybe I've turned into the invisible man that I use to be, where people would actually sit on me and not realize I was there until it was too late, or run into me in the halls, knock me over, and then finally say hi. Maggy in fact is the only person that I remember actually saying ""Hi"" to me in the halls today, and for that I thank her. As for the rest of you, I thank you anyways for the times when you do pay attention, because those are the times that I really remember. If only everyone could do that all the time, I wouldn't have to come home and completely forget entire days. I don't even remember most of middle school because of those reasons.

Today blew, as I said above. For unknown reasons though. This journal though made me happier. I put down the subject right away, which reads ""And I Awake,"" and I realize now that it's a wonderful title for a song. I need to get to writing lyrics again. And then I can post them and have only Matt Hammond tell me how they are. Haha. I didn't play guitar today, didn't skateboard. I just sang, and sang, and sang. My throat hurts now because of it. I've got a tenor voice but can hit way high notes, and damn, after a while, it really takes its toll. Well, I believe I'm off to listen to music till around two or three o'clock tonight. And honestly people, take my advice and just say hi to everyone in the halls, and especially the people who look like they aren't having the best of days. You'd be suprized the effects it has on people. I'm off. Hopefully school won't be so wierd tomorrow. Peace and love everyone. Goodnight."

But seriously, my life repeats day to day. School, guitar/skate, phone, read, sleep. Same the next day, and the next after that, and so on. Every month or so something exciting will happen, then it returns to normal. That is, if a repetative life can be concidered normal. There's no point to it anymore. Honestly, the only thing that could kick me out of this ""Dance of Eternity"" is if I happen to get a girlfriend, and that's only because I've never had a girlfriend before. It'd be a big change. And if we all just think about it a minute, aren't all of our lives like that. Repetative. They all dance around into eternity, never changing too much, always returning to the way they use to be. Every once in a while something terribly big will happen and our lives shift gears for a few, and then they find a new way to dance on into eternity. All that I can say is that I've been waiting for my life to shift for who knows how many countless years. And as of right now, I figured it out. I was waiting....that's the worst thing someone can do for anything. Don't wait, just go do it. I need to get off my ass and change my life. And I guess that could go for a lot of things in everyones lives. Just don't wait for anything. If you're tempted to wait, go do what you're going to wait and do. Otherwise, all of our lives will dance on forever into an unchanging universe.

My day was quite the same as always, except I watched three movies today instead of two. I saw The Perfect Score in theaters today. It was pretty good actually. Jenny was there, that was awesome. She's rad. After that I came home and talked to Amber online while I was singing some Dream Theater songs. That's always a joy during the day. After that, ate dinner, played guitar, and then had to watch Agent Cody Banks...wow, alls I can say about that is wow. I can't even believe they made that movie. Ashley called after it was over. That DEFINANTLY made my day. That girl is ""Da Bomb,"" I'm telling you. We sat and talked about nothing for a good long while. Actually it was more laughs then talking, but hey, it's all the same to me anyways. She makes me feel spucial. Then I watched Malibooty....again, why did they bother making that movie too. How gay was that. Now I'm talking to only one of the coolest girls to ever grace the face of this planet. Miss Angela. My goodness, whoever gets to marry her will definantly be about the luckiest guy on the planet. Not only is she gorgeous, but she glows too. It's like the north star shining through a cloudy sky. I'm also talking to Kyle and Matt, two of my better guy friends from Virginia. Both musically talented, and talented with their skateboards too. Miss them all dearly. Well I'm done blabbering for the night. Peace and love everyone, and sweet dreams."

The wind in Salisbury is so terrible though that it's hard for me to skate because all of my tricks are high and get blown around by the stupid wind. What a sorry excuse for a state. Not only is it flat, but it's also windy. How gay...oh well, not much I can do. I was hopefully suppose to go to Vans Skatepark in Potomac Mills, Virginia today (today meaning around noon) with my friends Roberto and Sagar, both of whom live in Virginia still.

I had to let it sit for like four hours so that the strings would settle and stop going out of tune immediatly. Watched 28 Days Later tonight....wow, what a horrible excuse for a horror movie. I don't think I've laughed so hard at a movie for being stupid before. Not only was the plot and acting bad, but the whole idea for the movie was bad too. If you want something scarey, rend House of 1000 Corpses. It's a Rob Zombie movie, and I hear it's scary as hell. Apparently it's almost as messed up as the Faces of Death movies, which are wierd. I would know, I've seen one of them. Maybe that's why I'm messed up. Faces of Death probobly screwed me over when I was little, hahahah. So yes, I talked with Amber a little tonight. She's awesome. I don't think I've ever talked about music so much with anyone, and it never gets old. Me and her need to get a band together or something. That'd be awesome. Oh man, you all remember me talking about Hannah Teter? Maybe not, but it's okay. I went to some website looking for a picture of her, because she has the most gorgeous blue eyes I think I've ever seen. And it says ""Hannah's Screen name"" and then it gave the screen name to you. And this was on her sponsors site. So I put it on my buddy list for kicks, thinking that it was like a joke or something. Wrong I was. Tonight she was online, but away the entire time. I'm going to have to talk to her. That'll be way fun for me. She'll probobly just say, ""you're wierd, but I love it!"" Woot!! That'd make my day. Actually that'd make my year. I don't really know what else to say, so I won't say anything at all. Sweet dreams everyone, and sleep well. Peace and love."

"event","Well just today I realized how impossible it is for myself to force myself to not have a crush on someone. Yeah, apparently I have the willpower to not have a crush on them for like a full week, and then I start to break down and like them again. How gay is that? Especially when there's no chance for me anyways. It's like false hope. I have false hope for obtaining a girlfriend. And knowing myself, I'll probobly keep that false hope to myself and still believe in it, because that's what I do, hope for the best. Not that the best has ever happened to me, I always seem to get mediocre to worst, but my luck has to change sometime doesn't it? It seems the only thing I have in this life is an apparent skill for everything and anything I try to do. Friends always seem to be there for a little while, but then that never lasts too long for me. I've never had too many people that stuck around with me for very long. I think Virginia was about the only place that they have. A lot of them here in Maryland have already started to not notice me, which is gay because I've only been here for what, four or five months? I'd rather not count. However long it's been, it feels like I've been in my own self created hell. If there's a hell, this is what it'd be. A barren flat farmland area with absolutly  nothing to, only one mall with crappy stores, and people that befriend you and then forget that they are your friends. I don't know how much longer I will be able to live here unless something changes quickly. I certainly hope so. That, for once, will hopefully not be false hope. Maybe it will...Who knows. I guess I'll wait and see for myself.

Underworld was a sweet movie. I can't believe my brother liked it and I didn't. Although I guess he doesn't like the whole gothic and new age type stuff. In fact, I know he doesn't. He told me over Christmas break that he thought Wiccans were freaks. If only he knew how much that  hurt me. I'm Wiccan for those of you who didn't know. It's not satanism, it's actually probobly one of the most pieceful religions on this god forsaken planet. But my family doesn't know I'm Wiccan. If they did they'd probobly beat me or something worse. So yeah, I lost the person that I look up to, my childhood hero. That of course was my brother. So now I have only myself to live by. I guess that's good. But yeah, the movie was incredible. I love the whole gothic city type thing that the director created. 'Twas wonderful. I still have my corn rows in from yesterday, and they are still totally tubular. Today, I don't think I'm doing anything. Maybe skating if it's not windy outside, but then it's always gay and windy outside, because this state, and especially this city, suck majorly. Yeah, screw my dad for making us move here. But whatever. Hopefully I'll get to do something. Maybe someone will call me for once. Maybe I'll just have to end up calling someone later and making them take me whereever they are going tonight. That'd be fun. It's always fun to tag along, especially when you know that the other people secretly don't like you. That makes it a blast. But for now, I'm out. I'll probobly make another post late tonight or really early tomorrow morning. Why? Because I can, and because I have nothing better to do. So for now, taa taa. Peace."

"event","I'd say this song describes me pretty well. The title anyways. Off The Top, by Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. The song is in fact, off the top. It's crazy to the max, I'm telling you. World class banjo player, a sweet saxophonist. They play crazy fast. KA-RAY-Z!!! It makes me want to start playing banjo. But anyways. Yeah, I'd say I'm off the top most of the time. I've got a bouncy personality (basically ditzy) when I'm around certain people, but then I'm really quite and odd and dwell on things a whole lot. It's at those times that my hatred for people really shows. Certain people that is. I mean, I can't actually hate someone for who they are, but I can definantly hate the sheep in this world for being sheep. Sheep being a term used to describe the people that follow everyone else around and do what they do. The trendy people in this world. The people that think they are being origional, only to find out that they were following someone else, who was the one to be origional in the first place. So yeah, I'm sorta off the top in the aspect that I'm all over the place in the mind, emotion, and personality parts of my mind. And I guess I'm off the top when I skateboard and play guitar. Not to sound cocky, but I sound pretty damn good on guitar lately. So yeah, if you ask me, I'm definantly off the top. Haha.

Today was funny. We went to school for a half day, and did nothing. It was suppose to be exam day, but exams were waived this year. So tomorrow and friday I have off, and monday also. Pretty rad yes? I know. First period, Sarah gave me four corn rows, and damn, they're awesome. Second, third, fourth, and fifth were uneventful. We went home after that, where I proceded to play guitar for three hours until my A and G string broke on the same strum, at the exact same time. Improvization really takes it's toll on my strings. Tonight I did nothing. I tried to call Randi, Lindsay, Lindsey, Angela, and Erin, but to no avail. No one was there. Sort of rotten. I have terrible luck. So everyone's going on a snowboarding trip and I'm VERY jealous because of it. I want to snowboard so bad. I've never been before, but I know I'd be awesome at it. I would of course have to learn McTwists or Misty Flips if I went, because I'm wierd like that and would have to try the hardest trick I could think of. So I'm talking to Stan, Ashley, and Lindsay online right now. Those three are awesome. Stan Pan is the man, I swear that kid is crazy sometimes, but it's for the best. I'm off to watch Underworld right now, because I want to be gothic and look like a vampire, and also like my friends from Dimmu Borgir. Peace my friends, and sweet dreams."

"event","I'm going to skip ranting tonight, because some of you are probobly thinking that I'm a terrible person to hate people so much. Not so. But, I have to many things to say right now, and not enough time...well, plenty of time. After all, I don't sleep hardly at all. It's more of laziness, and the fact that probobly three of you read this. No point in venting anyways, I'm having a good day.
   I really need a band though. If I were still in Virginia, I'd have no problem with this. I could pull together a Prog-Rock (progressive rock, for those of you who don't know what that means) or a Prog-metal band nearly instantaniously. It was that easy. And people actually had good musical tastes in Virginia. Now I'm not going to say that your music sucks...actually I am. Punk music blows. The only talent there is in it, is lyrical writing, and half the time you can't understand it because the band is being so punky, they mispronounce the words and slur them together like drunken buffoons. So yes, punk music sucks. And what do you know, EVERYONE in Salisbury LOVES punk music. No one likes Prog-Rock, only punk. That and half the musicians (drummers, bassists, and other guitarists) wouldn't even be capable of the skill it takes to play music like Dream Theater, Dimmu Borgir, Opeth, Pearl Jam, Counting Crows, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones...need I go on? They just can't pull it together. The people that would have potencial, have just that. Potencial, not much else. Give them a few years and they might be able to do it, but other then that, sorry, it won't happen. So by the time I get a band together, Prog-rock/Prog-metal will be back in style again and I'll be famous. It's that easy. Either that or I'll have kicked off a skateboarding career...I think the later of them is least likely, but it could still definantly happen. So if any of you happen to know who Dream Theater is, and know any bassist and drummers, and possibly guitarists who can play their music, tell me, because I'm desperate for a band here. 

My day was great. I talked with Ashley a ton online. Watched the X Games. Talked with Lindsey on the phone. Talked with Ashley (yes, same Ashley) on the phone. That made my day. That girl is awesome, I was laughing nonstop. Maybe that's because I was so hyper and had Mountain Dew in my hands, but it was still awesome. Oh, I just remembered the other highlight of my day. I hurt my hand playing guitar. That just goes to show how much I play. I was like, ""Finally, an omen that i've played guitar long enough and hard enough."" So now I'll probobly have to take a break for a day. Feels like I'm getting artheritis. Hahaha. That'd be awesome wouldn't it? But yes, that made my day. Made me feel good, made me feel that I'm actually sweet at guitar now. Anyways, off to exercise before I lie in bed and listen to music. I can finally do one handed push-ups. Proud of me? I am. So yes, off to do those. Peace and love, and sweet dreams everyone. Goodnight.

Ah, I almost forgot, the picture somewhere near this posting, is of the band Dimmu Borgir. I really want to go gothic so I can look like any of them. Just not the bald one. He's gross. Mostly the one in the front. He rules all."

"event","Wow, I'm sick of people. I'm sick of everyone, if only there was a way that would make people leave me alone, I would do anything to have it. People disgust me. I think almost every one of my friends ends up pissing me off and abandoning me in some crucial moment for me. Key word being ""almost."" For those of you who end up sticking by me always, you got mad props. Honestly though, I go so far out of my way for my friends, and I'm just fed up with it. I really wonder where some of them would be now. Probably six feet under. But I get nothing for it. Sorry about my bitchy mood tonight people, but I happened to realize this aspect of my life while watching the Winter X Games VIII. Yes, that's right, this whole thing is a product of my boredom, because when I'm bored, I think. And when I think, I usually find flaws in myself, but I'm done with finding things wrong with me. I'm better then that now though. I'm finding flaws now that are in other people, and I won't go out of my way to tell them to you, because I'm just not like that, but I certainly hope some of you try harder. Half of my friends I could put big money on and say that they don't really care too much about me. A lot of them think they're better then me in some way or another. Bullshit. And if you are, I'll end up being better then you, because that's what I'm all about. Being the best at everything I do. Skateboarding, guitar, singing, writing, you name it. I hate to sound cocky and all but I'm sick of it. I've been humble for too long. Most of you wouldn't even recignize me anymore, because I've become confident with myself. To those of you that are use to humble Aaron, the one that thinks so low of himself that he's lower then dirt, I'm afraid I'd have to say that he's dead. I honestly wouldn't hurt a fly, let alone anyone elses emotions, unless they were mine. Don't take this the wrong way, just keep an open mind, the next time you do, or rather don't do, something for your friends, think of the effects. Think if they need you right now, because most likely, they will.

My day was awesome. Randi made my day, I won't tell you why, but I can just say I can go looking for a different person to ask out now. Funny, that should have pissed me off, but I was really understanding...at least I thought I was. I hope I was. Just hope she's happy no matter what, as that is what I hope for the rest of my friends. Yeah, it snowed. And it was a snow day. Big whoop. Snows great, but no one thinks of me when we have days off. And if they do, they are too busy with everyone else to bother even calling to see if I'm still alive. If I had two lives, I'd kill myself just to see peoples reactions, and so that I could live my other life on the edge. I mean, how many people would really care? They'd probably forget I was gone in a week. That's what happened when I moved here. Poof. I'm gone, there's some tears, mainly mine, and a week later, ""Who the hell is Aaron?"" But yeah, it'd be sweet knowing I only had one life like I do now. I don't see why people are afraid of crap, it's just ticking off the years of our short lives anyways. Well, I'm done rambling, I need to go think of someone else I might be compatible with as far as dating goes. That'd be nice. Sweet dreams and goodnight to all."

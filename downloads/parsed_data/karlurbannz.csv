"event","<b>Harry:</b> C'mon.  *tossing you the keys*

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, looking up in time to catch the keys*  Where're we going?

<b>Harry:</b> Pet store.  *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> Pet...oh!  *scrambles up, shoving my feet into Birkenstocks, then stopping & looking down at the kids*  Um...

<lj-cut text=""...the kittens get new toys and names..."">
<b>Harry:</b> They'll be fine.  *brushing my lips over your cheek*  It's the middle of their sleep cycle.

<b>Karl:</b> *chews my lip for a moment, then nods*  Right.

<b>Harry:</b> Just means you can't buy out the entire store this time.  *winks*

<b>Karl:</b> That's what you think.  *grins, almost bouncing as I start down the stairs*  Let's go.

<b>Harry:</b> *following you, eyes narrowed*  We haven't got that much time.

<b>Karl:</b> We don't?  *innocent look over my shoulder*  Plans?

<b>Harry:</b> Just six ferrets alone in the house.  *walking with you to the car*

<b>Karl:</b> *grins*  Four of 'em don't have their eyes open yet, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> *glances at you*  Please.  Like that means anything.

<b>Karl:</b> Well, it's not like they can get into trouble.  *starts the car, grinning over at you*

<b>Harry:</b> Their parents cause quite enough, thank you.

<b>Karl:</b> Not today they won't.  *smiles, navigating the road with ease*  Too busy keeping an eye on the babies.

<b>Harry:</b> Which is a definite blessing.  *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft snort*  Yeah, I know.

<b>Harry:</b> No buying the store.  *as we pull up into the parking lot*

<b>Karl:</b> I'm only going to buy what they need.  *serene smile*

<b>Harry:</b> You think they need everything.  *mutters*  That's the problem.

<b>Karl:</b> *flashes you a look*  I do not.

<b>Harry:</b> Do so.  *getting out of the car*

<b>Karl:</b> I don't.  *leads you into the store*  They need a bigger bed.  And we'll have to get some more toys...and find out if the shampoo we use on Szoros and Vidam is okay for them.  Oh, and at least one more litter box, leashes...and we need to see if Vidam needs any special food right now...

<b>Harry:</b> *follows you, laughing*  They're not big enough for baths yet, or leashes.  Vidam's food is obviously fine.  And they haven't even opened their eyes yet.  They don't need toys.

<b>Karl:</b> They will need some.  *nods*  So we may as well get it now.

<b>Harry:</b> You're going to be an impossible mother.  *shaking my head*  We'll get what we need as we need it.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh, fine.  *mutters, stopping in front of the pet beds*

<b>Harry:</b> *nudging your shoulder*  Stop pouting.  *looking over the beds*  Like that one.

<b>Karl:</b> Then that one it is.  *picks it up and starts towards the register*

<b>Harry:</b> You are pouting.  *sighs, following you*

<b>Karl:</b> No, I'm not.  *quietly, glancing at you*  Do we need anything else?

<b>Harry:</b> More litter, I think.

<b>Karl:</b> Okay.  *nods, going to grab a box, trying to decide if I should grab another litter box while I'm at it*

<b>Harry:</b> *stepping behind you, hand wrapped around your hip*  Sure you're alright?

<b>Karl:</b> *glances up*  Yeah, I'm fine.  Just got a little carried away, I guess.

<b>Harry:</b> It's understandable.  *kissing the top of your head*  Few toys and things wouldn't hurt, I guess.  Long as we keep them away from their parents.

<b>Karl:</b> You sure?  *quick peek*  I mean...they are still really little, so...

<b>Harry:</b> Just a few things.  *smiles*  For babies.

<b>Karl:</b> Baby toys.  *nods, looking around*

<b>Harry:</b> They have baby toys for ferrets?  *wandering with you down the next aisle*

<b>Karl:</b> *stops in the middle of the aisle*  I, um...I don't know.

<b>Harry:</b> Should we ask?

<b>Karl:</b> *small smile*  Might be a good idea.  And maybe a book on raising baby ferrets.

<b>Harry:</b> Very good idea.  *flagging down the next person i see to ask where baby ferret stuff is*

<b>Karl:</b> *hides my smile at the look you get*

<b>Harry:</b> *glancing at you, shaking my head*  Amateurs.  *taking your hand*  C'mon.  We'll find everything ourselves.

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe a book will help...  *snags a ferret book as we pass the rack*

<b>Harry:</b> What's it say?  *glancing back as i paw through a rack of stuffed toys*

<b>Karl:</b> Hmmm...  *flipping through the pages*  Nothing with sharp edges or points...soft toys...and things like rubber balls and pulls.

<b>Harry:</b> Basic baby stuff, got it.  *tossing a few toys in our basket*

<b>Karl:</b> *still reading through the book as we walk*  Oh, and it says here there's an ointment we can get for their eyes, to keep them moist before they open.

<b>Harry:</b> They need an ointment?  *searching the shelves for it*  

<b>Karl:</b> It says they might.  *frowns as I read*  Not always, though...so maybe we should get it just in case?  *glances up*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  Hate for them to have dry eyes.  *grinning in triumph, tossing the ointment into the basket*

<b>Karl:</b> That wouldn't be good.  *smiles*

<b>Harry:</b> Anything else?

<b>Karl:</b> Nothing that I can see here.  Probably have to sit down and read it.

<b>Harry:</b> Toss it in the basket, then.  *walking back up to the register*

<b>Karl:</b> *follows you, smiling*

<b>Harry:</b> *pays for everything & tags the bags, gesturing to you*  Lead the way, epaei.

<b>Karl:</b> Gladly.  *flashing you a bright smile as we walk out of the store*

<b>Harry:</b> *putting everything in the trunk & sliding in the car when you unlock it*  So, I've been thinking about their names.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah?  *looks over, trying not to sound too eager*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *glances over at you*  Wanna hear 'em?

<b>Karl:</b> Please.  *nods, giving up on trying not to look eager & pathetic*

<b>Harry:</b> Lukav, Pametan and Merakli.  *serene smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, sounding out the names as I drive*  Um, Sin...that's only three names.

<b>Harry:</b> She's being a bit stubborn.  *nods*  But I'll get it out of her.

<b>Karl:</b> She...  *glancing over at you in confusion*

<b>Harry:</b> The girl.  Your granddaughter?  *reminding you*

<b>Karl:</b> The...girl?  *blinks again*  Just one?

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *looking at you*  Three boys, one girl.  Thought you knew that. 

<b>Karl:</b> No, I, um...hadn't checked.  *small smile*  So those are the boys' names?

<b>Harry:</b> Yep.  Well?

<b>Karl:</b> What do they mean?

<b>Harry:</b> Curious, clever and wily.  *grins at you*  Which I'm certain they will be.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm sure they will.  *smiles*  She's being stubborn, though?

<b>Harry:</b> Of course.  *laughs*  Uporan she will be.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  Uporan?

<b>Harry:</b> Stubborn.

<b>Karl:</b> *smiles*  Well, there you go.  They all have names now.

<b>Harry:</b> So, they do.  *chuckles*  

<b>Karl:</b> *sinking into my bond for a moment, smiling when I feel the four new, faint pulses there alongside the two tiny, bright ones*  They're perfect.

<b>Harry:</b> 'Course they are.  They're ours.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, they are.  *smiles, pulling into the driveway*

<b>Harry:</b> *gathering the bags & walking with you into the house*  See?  Still sleeping.

<b>Karl:</b> *crouching down to check them, smiling when vidam rouses enough to give me a sleepy squeak*  I know, sweetheart.  We have you a bigger bed.

<b>Harry:</b> *placing it next to the old one*  There.

<b>Karl:</b> *smiling when she squeaks again, Szoros finally rousing to see what's going on*  Apparently we forgot to put blankets in it.

<b>Harry:</b> Remind them that they're lying on the blankets.  *crouches down, petting szoros & then lukav's tiny head*

<b>Karl:</b> *muffles my laughter when Vidam gives you an indignant sounding squeak*  Think we're gonna have to help 'em out here.

<b>Harry:</b> Of course.  *pickins lukav & merakli up over their soft sounds of protest*  Shh, little ones.  It's alright.

<b>Karl:</b> *picks up the other two, nodding when you mouth their names at me, settling them in my lap as Vidam shoves Szoros out of the bed*

<b>Harry:</b> *barely containing my laughter when szoros bites at vidam, glaring as he slinks into my lap, curling around his sons*  Always trouble in Paradise with those two.

<b>Karl:</b> *not even trying to control my laughter as Vidam soundly scolds Szoros, curling up in my lap and glaring at him*  He should know better than to mess with a nursing mother.  *grins, moving the blankets to the new bed*

<b>Harry:</b> Well, they're his first children, too.  *petting the kids in my lap*

<b>Karl:</b> Least things aren't boring with them around.  *smiles as I transfer Pametan and Uporan to the new bed, stroking them with one finger as they wiggle a bit before curling up again, and Vidam crawls in to check them*

<b>Harry:</b> *szoros take the time to slink after vidam, giving her another growl of annoyance before looking up at me expectantly*  Yeah, they're coming.  *smiles at him, putting lukav & merakli beside their siblings, petting them as they immediately curl around each other*

<b>Karl:</b> Put 'em all together and you have an almost full-size ferret.  *smiles, watching as Vidam creeps over to nuzzle Szoros, chittering softly to him*

<b>Harry:</b> Just about.  *szoros nuzzles vidam, giving her a low squeak as they settle down around their babies, curling together*  Looks like they made up.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, they don't stay mad long.  *gently drapes a blanket over them before tugging you away from the bed*

<b>Harry:</b> Way it should be.  *smiles, walking with you out of the room & down the hall*

<b>Karl:</b> Care for a drink?  *going first down the stairs, hand curled around yours*

<b>Harry:</b> Only if you're buying.  

<b>Karl:</b> Not buying.  Making.  *grins*  Been told I can mix a wicked drink.

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah?  Who told you that?  *winks*

<b>Karl:</b> Oh, a few people here and there.  *strolls to the bar, pulling out glasses and bottles*  Name your poison, Sin.  *grins at you as you settle onto the couch*

<b>Harry:</b> Well, I used to use mushrooms before arsenic got big.  *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> *rolls my eyes*  Always the comedien.  *sets about mixing drinks, nodding towards the coffee table*  Mail's there if you want to look at it.

<b>Harry:</b> Who wants me this week?  *bending forward & grabbing the stack of letters & catalogs, flipping through them*

<b>Karl:</b> Just the usual, I think.  *starts towards you with the drinks*

<b>Harry:</b> It always is.  *tossing aside the mail & flipping through the catalogs, smiling at you when you settle down beside me*  See this one?  *holding it up to you*

<b>Karl:</b> Ah, yes.  *eyes it as if it might bite, handing you your drink*  That one.

<b>Harry:</b> You alright?  *taking it with a nod of thanks, sipping slowly*

<b>Karl:</b> I, um, didn't order that, if that's what you're thinking.  *glances at the cover, sipping my drink*

<b>Harry:</b> Never thought you did.  *quietly, flipping through the catalog*

<b>Karl:</b> Okay.  *sneaks a peek*  Didn't look at it.

<b>Harry:</b> Wanna?  *holds it open*

<b>Karl:</b> Um....  *scoots a little closer, chewing my bottom lip*  Sure.

<b>Harry:</b> *wrapping my free arm around you & flipping through the catalog*

<b>Karl:</b> That's really nice.  *softly, stopping you, fingertips touching the page*  I like it.

<b>Harry:</b> The crib?  *nodding when you do*  Dunno how crazy I am about maple for his room, though.  Seems awfully dark.

<b>Karl:</b> It comes in bleached oak, too.  See?  *points to the smaller, inset picture*  And it could be a girl.

<b>Harry:</b> Then we definitely get the oak if it's a girl.  *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> But not if it's a boy?  *blinks, confused*

<b>Harry:</b> You don't think cedar for a boy?

<b>Karl:</b> *chews the side of my thumb as I study the picture*  Cedar would be nice.

<b>Harry:</b> How about mahogany?

<b>Karl:</b> Kinda dark, though, innit?

<b>Harry:</b> Hmm...maybe.  *flips the page*  God, that's ghastly.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  Quick, turn the page!

<b>Harry:</b> *chuckles as i do so*

<b>Karl:</b> Oh...  *softly, staring at the picture*

<b>Harry:</b> *nuzzles your hair*  See something you like?

<b>Karl:</b> That's perfect, don't you think?  *lightly touches a picture, not looking away from it*

<b>Harry:</b> I guess.  What's it for?  

<b>Karl:</b> A baby.  *smiles up at you*

<b>Harry:</b> *eyes you*  No, I mean, what's it used for?  Looks like a vest of some type.  Or is it a jumper?

<b>Karl:</b> What's the type say?  *trying to read it*

<b>Harry:</b> Winter wear.  Whatever that means.

<b>Karl:</b> Guess it's a jumper then.

<b>Harry:</b> Lovely shade of green.  *smiles at you, turning the page again*

<b>Karl:</b> *biting my bottom lip as I study the photos*

<b>Harry:</b> What is it?  *watching you*

<b>Karl:</b> Nothing.  *smiles*  Some nice stuff in this catalog.

<b>Harry:</b> If you were female, epaei, I'd swear your hormones were raging.  *smiles*

<b>Karl:</b> *glances up*  What's that supposed to mean?

<b>Harry:</b> You want to start right now is what I mean.

<b>Karl:</b> Start what?  *blinks*  Trying to get pregnant?

<b>Harry:</b> *nods*

<b>Karl:</b> *small frown*  Thought we'd already started on that.

<b>Harry:</b> Not lately.

<b>Karl:</b> *sidelong look, hand resting on the catalog*  You want to?

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.

<b>Karl:</b> Well...  *turns a page, studying the nursery decorations*  If you do, just let me know.

<b>Harry:</b> Think you could handle infants and six ferrets at the same time? *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> The ferrets pretty much take care of themselves.  And I have help there.  *smiles*  Just like I would with an infant.

<b>Harry:</b> *slow nod, then i untangle myself from you & stand, holding out my hand*  C'mon.

<b>Karl:</b> *slips my hand in yours, letting you pull me up*  Where're we going?

<b>Harry:</b> *grins, tugging you into my arms*  To start working on expanding this family of ours.

<b>Karl:</b> I like the way you think, Sin...  *grins, reaching for the buttons on your shirt*

<b>Harry:</b> Of course you do.  *tugging your t-shirt off*  Why we're soulmates.

<b>Karl:</b> Nah, we're soulmates 'cause you can't live without me.  *grins, voice changing as I drop into the bond and my body shifts under your hands*

<b>Harry:</b> That, too.  *voice going thick with need when my hands slide over your curves, then up to cup your breasts*

<b>Karl:</b> *shivers under your touch, tongue sliding across my lower lip as my now too-big jeans slide right over my hips*  Knew it...  *unbuttons your shirt, slipping it off your shoulders*

<b>Harry:</b> *pulling my hands free of my shirt and lifting you up, smiling when long legs wrap around my waist*  Know what I'd love even more?  *nibbling just under your ear*

<b>Karl:</b> What's that?  *breathless, pressing against you, shivering against as taut nipples brush across your chest*

<b>Harry:</b> *starts to whisper in your ear as i carry you upstairs to our bedroom*"

<lj-cut text=""Karl wakes Harry..."">

<b>Karl:</b> *I watch you while you sleep, smiling, tracing the lines of your face with a very light touch.  I love the way you look like this...peaceful, calm, almost but not quite innocent.  Leaning forward, I brush my lips over your jaw.  No response.  Okay then...guess that means I'll have to resort to more drastic measures.  So, with a wicked smile, I duck under the covers, moving slowly so I don't wake you yet, and take you in my mouth, tongue sliding along your length, smiling when your body starts to respond*

<b>Harry:</b> *pleasant, light thoughts drift through my mind like webs of spun silk, and i sink further into them, into gossamar dreams...and am abruptly enclosed in a molten inferno.  jesus... my hands are already reaching out to cup the back of your head, thread through your hair, before my mind catches up to my body's awareness*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles softly around you...oh yeah, you're awake now...starts to move, sucking lightly, tongue slipsliding over your growing length*

<b>Harry:</b> *brain still foggy, but my nerves, skin, body is on fire as i twist up into your mouth, seeking more of your heat, curling my fingers over your scalp...and that little reverb laugh of yours just might kill me*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles again, still moving slowly, sucking languidly as if I planned on doing this all day, fingers roaming over your thighs and stomach*

<b>Harry:</b> Pleassssse... *word escaping on a hiss when your fingers trail across a sensitive batch of skin and i shiver into the contact, pushing up again, actively seeking more*

<b>Karl:</b> *settles down to focus on what I'm doing, the blanket cocooning me, reaffirming how much I love waking you up like this, how much I like your slow, sleepy moans, the taste of you heavy on my tongue*

<b>Harry:</b> *throat working, drowning in heat, hips bucking as i push -- slicksweet -- down your throat, lost in sensation, bond pulsing with love and need*

<b>Karl:</b> *that's it, love...lose control for me, in me, with me...fuck, I love that I can do this to you...continuing to move, tongue gliding over and around your cock, dipping into the slit, then sliding down the underside as I take you deep*

<b>Harry:</b> *every nerve ending along my cock stretches until something finally snaps -- i stiffen, fingers spasming in your hair -- spilling down your throat in a hot rush*

<b>Karl:</b> *the bond pulses with love, and I swallow it all, tongue slowly curling around you before I slide back up your body to kiss you softly*  Morning, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> *hoarse, sleepy voice*  Morning.  *smiling into our kiss*

<b>Karl:</b> *curls around you, head pillowed on your shoulder, smiling*

<b>Harry:</b> *wrapping my arms around you, feeling incredibly lethargic*  Wassat'for?

<b>Karl:</b> Cause I love you.  *softly, kissing your shoulder*

<b>Harry:</b> Love you.  *still mumbling a bit, curling into your warmth*

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *smiles at the sleepy note in your voice, hands sliding along your back*

<b>Harry:</b> Feltnice... *smiles at the light touches*

<b>Karl:</b> Was supposed to.  *still smiling, stroking your back*

<b>Harry:</b> Time'sit?

<b>Karl:</b> Little after 9.

<b>Harry:</b> *one eye cracking open*  Morning or evening?

<b>Karl:</b> Morning.  *soft laugh*  We slept all afternoon and all night.

<b>Harry:</b> Did we?  *grinning, nuzzling your neck*  How decadent of us.

<b>Karl:</b> *smiles, stretching*  We did.

<b>Harry:</b> Guess we needed it.

<b>Karl:</b> Guess so.  *kisses your shoulder again*  Feel better.

<b>Harry:</b> M'glad.  *smiles, slight pang in my heart at all you had to go through without me*

<b>Karl:</b> *looks up, touching your chin*  What's wrong?

<b>Harry:</b> Nothing.  *small smile, watching you*  Just remembering.

<b>Karl:</b> You looked sad.

<b>Harry:</b> Did I?

<b>Karl:</b> A little.  *softly, fingers smoothing your forehead*

<b>Harry:</b> I'm sorry.  *smiling again*  I am happy.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm glad.  *bright smile*  I am, too.

<b>Harry:</b> Are you?  Truly?

<b>Karl:</b> *serious gaze*  I'm very happy, Harry.

<b>Harry:</b> Alright.  *placing your head back under my chin*  All that matters.

<b>Karl:</b> I love you.  *whispers, snuggling in close, one arm wrapped tight around your waist*

<b>Harry:</b> Lyublyu tebya vsem sertsem, vsey dushoyu.  *shifting until we're even more closely aligned*  Always.

<b>Karl:</b> What's all that mean?  *softly, placing small kisses across your collarbone*

<b>Harry:</b> Um, it's...Russian.  *rubbing my hands along your back*  Means I love you with my heart and soul.  Roughly.

<b>Karl:</b> *bright smile as the bond flares with everything I feel*  You /are/ my soul, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> As you are mine.  *gentle kiss on your cheek*  Always have been.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *frames your face with both hands and kisses you softly*

<b>Harry:</b> *sigh of satisfaction*  When would you like to leave?  

<b>Karl:</b> As soon as you'd like.  *smiles*  Miss the kids.

<b>Harry:</b> Doubtless, they miss us just as much.  *smiles, then studies your eyes again*  Karl...how much do you remember of why we're here?

<b>Karl:</b> We came to...to...  *trails off, forehead wrinkling as I try to remember*  To find another Thracian?  To...um...explain why I can do what I can do?

<b>Harry:</b> Yes.  *kissing your forehead*  Exactly.

<b>Karl:</b> We found...  *another frown*  Jack.  And he...  *bigger frown*  ...knocked me out?

<b>Harry:</b> He didn't mean to.  He was...um...trying to experiment with your elemental bond.  Backfired a little.

<b>Karl:</b> Made me sick.  *frowns*  I remember that.

<b>Harry:</b> It, um... *how to phrase this* ...also may have affected your bond.  Just a bit.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, staring at you*  I don't feel any different.

<b>Harry:</b> What you can do, I mean.  *shrugs*  Although it may not have.  We weren't sure.

<b>Karl:</b> *pokes at the bond a bit*  It doesn't seem any different.  But I can never tell.

<b>Harry:</b> We need to start practicing again soon, anyway.  *deep breath*  Maybe after...after I get back from Paris.

<b>Karl:</b> Paris?  *grows still, lifting my head to look at you*  I didn't know we were going to Paris.

<b>Harry:</b> *very softly*  It's next week, Karl.  One week from today.

<b>Karl:</b> What...oh.  *small voice, realizing exactly what you mean*  So, um...

<b>Harry:</b> *thick voice*  I need to be in Paris.  J-join...will you?  Please?

<b>Karl:</b> I'll go with if you'd like me to.  *softly, touching your cheek*  The kids, too.

<b>Harry:</b> *quick nod*  I'd, um.  Like that.

<b>Karl:</b> Then we'll all go.  *smiles*

<b>Harry:</b> *softly*  Thank you.

<b>Karl:</b> You don't have to thank me.

<b>Harry:</b> Want to.

<b>Karl:</b> Then I'll accept it.  *soft smile*

<b>Harry:</b> *slow kiss*  Back t'sleep now?

<b>Karl:</b> Sure.  *softly, snuggling down against you*

<b>Harry:</b> M'kay.  *happily snuggling with you, eyes drifting closed*

<b>Karl:</b> *curls close, closing my eyes as I listen to your breathing*"

"event","Karl stands in the bathroom, studying her features in the mirror.  She can hear Harry, in the bedroom, playing with the kids.  Slowly, she undresses, folds her clothes, sets them aside.

They won't fit in a few minutes.

Looking back in the mirror, she reaches for her bond, smiling when it responds and her eyes start to glow softly.  Stunned, she watches.  Slow glide of flesh, moving from one form to the other.  The entire process takes just a couple of minutes, then it's over.

Picking up the jeans and shirt brought in with this in mind, Karl redresses himself, shoves unruly hair off his forehead.  Then steps back out into the bedroom.

<b>Karl:</b> *Szoros & Vidam curled in my arms, I walk slowly downstairs, murmuring softly to them as we search for Harry*

<b>Harry:</b> *rubbing my eyes as i shut off the computer, having notified everyone of my whereabouts for the foreseeable future, and i feel, rather than see, you and the kids at the door*  Hey.  *softly*

<b>Karl:</b> Hey.  *smiling softly as I move into the study, trying not to let on that I've noticed how tired you look*  I was wondering if I should pack their stuff again.

<b>Harry:</b> Hmm...oh, yeah.  We're taking them with us, right?  *peers at you out of bleary eyes*  Or you think they should stay behind for this?

<b>Karl:</b> *gently places the kids in your lap, smiling when they lift up & place tiny paws on your chest, cold noses nuzzling your chin*  I don't know, Sin.  *softly, moving behind you to massage your shoulders*  I worry when they're not with us, but...will they be safe?

<b>Harry:</b> *rolling my shoulders, soft groan when you hit a sensitive spot, absently petting the kids*  I don't know.  I know you said that...he...was fond of them.  But this is different.  

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath, focusing on the window as my touch remains gentle, working the knots out of your shoulders*  Yes, it is.  I know that...the last thing he would do was hurt them, but...

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly, placing one hand over yours, watching the kids as they curl up in my lap, sleeping peacefully*  They'll stay here.

<b>Karl:</b> Okay.  *softly, knowing I shouldn't be disappointed because they'll be safe here, no matter what happens*  Maybe...  *pausing, swallowing, still a little hurt by lunch the other day*  Maybe Lij can stay here...

<b>Harry:</b> *soft squeeze on your hand*  I think that's a lovely idea.  *quietly*  He's worried about us, epaei.  He's lost a lot of people very close to him recently.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *just as quietly, letting my hand rest under yours*  I just...maybe he'd like to stay here...for a bit...just so, you know, he's not alone...

<b>Harry:</b> It's a lovely idea.  We can call him later.  *kissing your hand*  He loves you -- don't give up on him because he's still confused.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm trying, Harry.  *softly, leaning against the back of your chair*  It's just...I look at him, and I can see he's hurting.  And I want to help...but he just pushes me away.

<b>Harry:</b> It's not going to be easy.  *glancing up at you*  But you have to keep pushing at him.

<b>Karl:</b> *small, sad smile*  It hurts to keep pushing only to be shut out.

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly*  I know.  *just as i know you're not just talking about elijah*

<b>Karl:</b> *meeting your eyes*  So tell me what I should do, Sin.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> Just what you're doing, love.  Being there.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft sigh, not at all surprised at your answer*  Sometimes I wish I could do more.

<b>Harry:</b> *sad smile*  I wish you could, too.  Wish this was all a bad dream.  But it's not. 

<b>Karl:</b> No, it' snot.  *quietly*  It's all too real.  But...soon, I'm going to forget a big chunk of it.

<b>Harry:</b> I know.  *throat convulsing*  And I'm going to have to bury it like it never existed to protect you.

<b>Karl:</b> Protect me?  *a little confused*

<b>Harry:</b> If I allow the memories into our bond... *trailing off, hoping you'll make the connection*

<b>Karl:</b> *breath catching in my throat*  *quietly*  I won't understand what they mean.

<b>Harry:</b> *nods*  Exactly.

<b>Karl:</b> *knows I'll be just as happy to forget some of those memories*  Harry...will it...bother you...to bury them?

<b>Harry:</b> Some of them, yes.  *slowly, choosing each word with care*  If we forget our mistakes, what is to prevent us from repeating them.  *quietly*  Thracians never truly die, love.  He could...it is possible, however slim.

<b>Karl:</b> *moving around the chair to kneel between your knees, looking up at you*  *softly*  Is there some way we can break that bond to you as well?

<b>Harry:</b> He's my son.  *cupping your chin with gentle fingers*  The blood bond can never be broken.

<b>Karl:</b> There's absolutely no way we can...I don't know...do something to prevent him ever using that bond?  *leaning into your hand, blinking back tears at the idea that there's always going to be a slim chance he could destroy what we've fought so hard to rebuild*

<b>Harry:</b> No.  There isn't.  *brushing your cheek, sensing pain in our bond, wishing i could lie to you, somehow make it all better*

<b>Karl:</b> *dropping my head, eyes tightly closed, and all I can do is pray that breaking my bond to him will be all it takes*

<b>Harry:</b> It'll be alright.  *tugging you up, kissing soft lips, reassuring you through our bond*

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe...maybe he'll let it go...  *whispers, head nestling in the crook of your neck*

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.  *kissing your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> You don't think he will, do you?  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> Not really.  His...his hatred of me...it's eternal.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft sigh*  I wish I knew some way to get through that hatred...to make him see.

<b>Harry:</b> Believe me, so do I.  *nuzzling your ear, hand resting comfortably on the curve of your hip*

<b>Karl:</b> *a single tear slips free, and I turn into your warmth, the kids easily adjusting to my being there, even in their sleep*  I just can't believe he'd destroy the chance of having more sisters...or a brother...

<b>Harry:</b> It'd be giving me another chance to take them from him.  *quietly, kissing away your tear*  But we're not going to let him know it's a possibility.

<b>Karl:</b> No, I don't suppose we are.  *softly, taking a deep breath, then another*  Harry...

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah?  *stroking your cheek*

<b>Karl:</b> *looking up at you, completely serious*  I'd like to talk to Marisol before we go.

<b>Harry:</b> You... *blinks* ...what?

<b>Karl:</b> I'd like to talk to her.

<b>Harry:</b> Why?

<b>Karl:</b> *quietly*  Because I think she might have some answers.

<b>Harry:</b> I... *puzzled* ...love, you didn't think much of her by your own admission.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh, I still think she's nuttier than a fruitcake.  *small smile*  But I think if she's got something really important to focus on...

<b>Harry:</b> You have been paying attention.  *smiles*

<b>Karl:</b> Of course I have.  *brighter smile*  Besides, I think it would be quite amusing to see her reaction to this body.

<b>Harry:</b> You're a cruel woman.  *laughs*  I wish I could see that.

<b>Karl:</b> I wish you could...too...  *trails off, eyes going wide*  Harry...you can!

<b>Harry:</b> I can?

<b>Karl:</b> Yes.  *bounces out of your lap & dashes out of the room, returning minutes later with a triumphant grin...and the video camera*

<b>Harry:</b> *laughs*  Dunno why we didn't think of that before.

<b>Karl:</b> We had other things on our minds.  *smiles, setting the camera on the edge of the desk*

<b>Harry:</b> So we did, so we did.  *watching you*  This should be interesting.

<b>Karl:</b> *fiddles with the camera for several minutes, then dragging a chair over and sitting so I can face you, making sure that both chairs are in view of the lens*  So, um...  *sheepish smile*  Would now be a good time?

<b>Harry:</b> I... *slow nod, urging the kids out of my lap, smiling when they both grumble and settle under the desk*  Sure.

<b>Karl:</b> Are you sure?  *softly, watching you*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *quick nod*  I'm sure.

<b>Karl:</b> Okay.  *smiling a little*  Well, then...guess we should start.

<b>Harry:</b> Right.  *deep breath, smiling as i reach down, sink deep into the bond that links all thracians, all beings together, seeking marisol, submerging myself*

<b>Karl:</b> *watching you in silence, feeling my bond reach out and snare yours, providing you an anchor as you submerge*

<b>Marisol:</b>  *slow blink, then a delicate yawn, peering at you, studying decidedly feminine, beautiful features*  Funny, you don't look like Karl...

<b>Karl:</b> Shall I just call you Ms. Obvious from this point on?  *smiles, voice light & teasing*

<b>Marisol:</b> *lightly poking at your bond with harry, blinking in surprise at the way the colors run together*  You can call me whatever you want, love, as soon as you tell me why you have... *holding my cupped hands out to my chest* ...inside of that very impressive male physique from last time.

<b>Karl:</b> Would the male body make this a bit more...normal for you?  *trying not to giggle at the exaggerated way you're holding your hands*

<b>Marisol:</b> Please, child, I gave up on normal.  Bit of girl talk might be fun.  But not here.  *catching your hands and sending us someplace more...tropical*  There.  Always loved Tahiti at this time of year.  *settling on a chaise lounge*  Now, tell me why I'm here.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, looking around, then sighs*  Damn it.

<b>Marisol:</b> Something wrong?

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *rueful smile*  The video camera's on the desk in the study at home.

<b>Marisol:</b> Do you need it?  *airy wave and the stand with the camera appears at the foot of the chaise*  What are we filming?

<b>Karl:</b> Us.  *smiles*  So Harry can watch it afterwards.

<b>Marisol:</b> Sounds kinky.  *smiles*  Now.  I'm here, I have *another wave and a tray of drinks appears on the table between us* frothy drinks with paper umbrellas.  I'm set.  *wiggling my toes*  Would kill for a bikini, but I don't think that'd go over well in this body.  A pity.  I used to look good in nothing.

<b>Karl:</b> That body looks fabulous in nothing.  *hiding my smile behind my hand*

<b>Marisol:</b> That, young man, would be incest.  *primly*

<b>Karl:</b> Only if you were actually doing...things to it.  *cheeky grin, refraining from pointing out that I'm a woman at the moment*

<b>Marisol:</b> The thought is terrifying.  *picking up a drink*  Now, you, on the other hand, would look stunning naked, even like that.  Bet Harry's over the moon to be crawling inside that body.

<b>Karl:</b> Harry's rather taken with it, yes.  *small smile, looking down as I twist the rings on my finger*  Anyway...

<b>Marisol:</b> Pretty.  *tapping the bands*  Completed the bond, I take it?

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, it did.  *looks up at you, completely serious*  And I was hoping you might have some answers for me.

<b>Marisol:</b> I need questions first.  Would you like a drink?

<b>Karl:</b> *warily eyes the drinks*  Aren't those full of sugar?

<b>Marisol:</b> *bright grin*  Just one won't kill you.  'Sides, you're not diabetic in that body, now, are you?

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, startled*  I'm not?

<b>Marisol:</b> You haven't even bothered to look for yourself, have you?  *sad shake of my head*  You're an Elemental now, child.

<b>Karl:</b> Marisol, please...  *softly, a little ashamed*  I'm still very new at this.

<b>Marisol:</b> *patting your hand*  It's alright, love.  Here, I'll show you.  *gripping your hand & sinking us both into your bond*  See that?

<b>Karl:</b> That...what?  *a little confused, overwhelmed by blue&orange*

<b>Marisol:</b> That.  *gently poking*  It's all swirled together, but only in the blue.  Not orange.  No discoloration.  No disease.  

<b>Karl:</b> That's it?  *still confused*  But what about the orange?

<b>Marisol:</b> What about it?

<b>Karl:</b> Why is it here?  It wasn't until I shifted to this body...well, right before I shifted to this body.

<b>Marisol:</b> You mean to tell me you don't know?  *level look, slurping noisily on my drink*

<b>Karl:</b> *calmly*  If I knew, I wouldn't be asking.

<b>Marisol:</b> What's the opposite of blue, child?

<b>Karl:</b> *quietly*  Harry and I have already talked about that.  But I'm still the same me inside.  Why a new color?

<b>Marisol:</b> You're not, though, are you?  The same?

<b>Karl:</b> *very softly*  I don't know.

<b>Marisol:</b> A woman doesn't react the same, think the same, feel the same.  Your /soul/ is the same.  Your experiences, your past, the way you react to certain things, your beliefs.  But you don't feel as you do when you were male, do you?

<b>Karl:</b> *thinks back to what I said to Harry*  No, I don't.  *quietly, looking down*  I'm not as aggressive.

<b>Marisol:</b> And you wouldn't be.  Different center of gravity.  *nods*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes you*  What's my center of gravity have to do with it?

<b>Marisol:</b> men... *shaking my head* your center of gravity has everything to do with it.

<b>Karl:</b> *looks down, flushing*  I don't understand.

<b>Marisol:</b> Concentrate on your body, child.  Listen to it.  Women...their center of gravity slightly higher.  It's why you walk differently.

<b>Karl:</b> *half smile*  Actually, it's lower.  In our hips.  *grows serious again*  But I don't understand why that would make me less aggressive and more...I don't know...mothering.

<b>Marisol:</b> Higher, lower, I always forget.  *bright smile*  Point is, you /are/ a mother.  You can carry life in you.  Affects how you think.

<b>Karl:</b> We don't know if I can yet.  *quietly, trying to keep the longing out of my voice*  We don't even know why I shifted.

<b>Marisol:</b> Into a woman?  *picking up another drink*  Would've thought that'd be obvious.  Especially to Harry.

<b>Karl:</b> Well, it's not so obvious to me.  *soft sigh*  This shouldn't be possible, yet here I am.

<b>Marisol:</b> *patting your hand again, draining my glass*  You can shift so you /can/ get pregnant, child.  

<b>Karl:</b> So I...  *trails off, staring at you*  Marisol, we don't know if I can yet.  And why would the bond want me to?

<b>Marisol:</b> Of course you can.  Who said you couldn't?

<b>Karl:</b> *quietly, mumbling*  We haven't tried yet.

<b>Marisol:</b> Ah... *mmm...one more drink couldn't hurt* ...because of Lawrence?

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, not saying anything*

<b>Marisol:</b> I don't feel that in this body, either.

<b>Karl:</b> It doesn't exist in this body.  *quietly*

<b>Marisol:</b> Well, that would definitely explain it, then, wouldn't it?

<b>Karl:</b> *rubbing my temples*  That would explain what?

<b>Marisol:</b> Why I'm here.  *grins, stretching my toes*  

<b>Karl:</b> *closes my eyes for a moment*  You're here because the bond to Lawrence doesn't exist in this body?  Or because I've shifted so I can get pregnant?

<b>Marisol:</b> I'm here because my mate's brother summoned me.  *smiles*  But he summoned me because of Lawrence, didn't he?

<b>Karl:</b> Sort of.  *tired smile*  I don't suppose you got any idea what's going on, do you?

<b>Marisol:</b> Beyond my nephew being a truly sick individual, you mean?  Why aren't you drinking?  Here.  *pressing a glass into your hands*

<b>Karl:</b> *takes the glass and holds it because I'm so used to NOT drinking now*  Beyond that, yes.

<b>Marisol:</b> You want to know why the bond isn't here?

<b>Karl:</b> Yes.  *deep breath*  And how to break it in the other body.

<b>Marisol:</b> *considers*  Won't be easy.  He doesn't want it gotten rid of.

<b>Karl:</b> I know he doesn't.  *quietly*  But Harry won't even consider having a child until it's gone.  And while it doesn't exist in this body...

<b>Marisol:</b> You won't always be in this body.  *nods*  I don't know how to break it, however.  Without him finding out and stopping me.

<b>Karl:</b> But there are still Thracians alive who can, aren't there?  *watching you, trying not to get my hopes up*

<b>Marisol:</b> Of course.  It's possible.  S'at what you want?  *peering at you*  You'll forget him, you know.

<b>Karl:</b> I'll forget everything from the minute we bonded.  *quietly*  Yes, I know.

<b>Marisol:</b> And you're alright with that?

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath*  It should have never happened, and I know that now.  *quietly*

<b>Marisol:</b> *puzzled, concerned stare*  What do you mean?

<b>Karl:</b> *small, sad smile*  It's the one thing Harry can never forgive me for.  And for us to move past it...have a normal life...I have to do this.

<b>Marisol:</b> So, you're doing this for him.  Not you.

<b>Karl:</b> No.  I'm doing this for us.  For him so he can start healing finally.  And for me because...  *pauses*  Because it's painful living with both bonds.

<b>Marisol:</b> And...?  *measured stare*  The bond flared just then.  

<b>Karl:</b> And because I belong to Harry.  *softly*  Heart and soul.

<b>Marisol:</b> Well, now, that is a relief to hear.  *small smile*  For awhile, I was beginning to think you'd forgotten that.

<b>Karl:</b> Forgotten it?  *sharp look*  I've never once forgotten that I belong to him.

<b>Marisol:</b> You seemed to have been confused for awhile.  

<b>Karl:</b> Why's that?

<b>Marisol:</b> You still had a very strong hold on that.../bond/...with Lawrence.  *taps a finger against my chin*  I really wish I could talk to that boy.

<b>Karl:</b> I miss him.  *softly, shrugging a little*  He was my friend first.

<b>Marisol:</b> *slightly reproving look*  He was your son, Karl.  Some lines should never be crossed.

<b>Karl:</b> He was Diana's son.  *firmly, looking at you*  This body was never related to him.  I did what I thought I had to do at the time.

<b>Marisol:</b> The body doesn't matter.  He was still your son, still Harry's son.  *frowns*  But I will speak no more of this -- you destroyed the balance, it's right that you should put it back together.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm trying to.  *softly, sadly, looking down*  I'm just not sure of what I'm doing.

<b>Marisol:</b> This is a good step.  *patting your knee*  You've a good heart, Karl.  In time you'll gain the wisdom.  So, show me what you've been practicing.

<b>Karl:</b> I can shift at will now.  And do this easily...  *faint 'pop' and the kids appear in my lap, still curled up sound asleep*  I can talk to them now, too...sort of.

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, aren't they still just the cutest things?  *they appear in my lap & i absently pet them, smiling*  You've found your bond with them...that's good.

<b>Karl:</b> It's stronger now.  *quietly, watching your eyes*  Since the wedding.

<b>Marisol:</b> Since you completed the bond, you mean?  *shrugs, still petting & cooing at the ferrets*  Well, it would be, wouldn't it?  They belong to both of you.

<b>Karl:</b> Harry doesn't have that bond with them, though.  *a little confused*

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, he doesn't, does he?  *smirks*  Just because he doesn't have what /you/ have, young man, doesn't mean he has no bond with them.  *gentle sigh*  You mortal-borns always have such a problem with seeing more than one thing...

<b>Karl:</b> *looking down, chastised*  I'm sorry.  *quietly*  I don't know much yet.

<b>Marisol:</b> You'd learn more if you just closed your eyes.  *soft smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *glances up at you*  What do you mean?

<b>Marisol:</b> Close your eyes.

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath, then a slow nod, closing my eyes*

<b>Marisol:</b> *softly*  What do you feel?

<b>Karl:</b> The earth.  *just as softly*

<b>Marisol:</b> Go deeper.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know what to look for.  *whispers, trying to focus, feeling the earth beneath me, the sand shifting under the ocean, the plants along the shoreline*

<b>Marisol:</b> Look for... *smiles, thinking how pretty you look like this* ...look for your bond in the earth.

<b>Karl:</b> *small frown furrows my brow*  I already know that...s'blue, right?  Well, and orange now.

<b>Marisol:</b> You feel how it pulses all around, how it is the air, is the earth?

<b>Karl:</b> *half smile*  It does that all the time.

<b>Marisol:</b> You know why?

<b>Karl:</b> No.  *resists the urge to open my eyes*

<b>Marisol:</b> *smiles*  Follow the bond and tell me.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft sigh as I try to do what you've said*

<b>Marisol:</b> *waiting patiently, knowing there are some things i can't teach you*

<b>Karl:</b> *follows the bond, losing myself in it for a few minutes before surfacing with another sigh and slowly opening my eyes*  I'm sorry.  *miserably, feeling like I've failed something important*  I don't know what I'm doing.  I should have never been given this gift.

<b>Marisol:</b> You don't know what you're doing because you're still scared of it.  *looking at you with a compassionate gaze*  You, Harry, your bonds, the earth, the air, all of the elements...they're all bound now, Karl.  

<b>Karl:</b> I'm not scared of it.  *quietly*  I'm fucking terrified of it...of the things I can do if I lose control.  *closing my eyes tight, head down*  All I have is earth...how can they all be bound?

<b>Marisol:</b> What binds all of the elements together, Karl?  *still watching you*  What makes everything...your powers, Harry's, mine...all possible?

<b>Karl:</b> You're Thracian.  So's Harry.  *mumbles*

<b>Marisol:</b> I asked you a question.  *raised eyebrow*  I expect an answer, not an observation.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know.  *frustrated, on the edge of tears and trying hard not to show it*  Nature?  Some mysterious god I know nothing about?

<b>Marisol:</b> You're thinking too much.  *softly, cupping your chin*  What does all life need?

<b>Karl:</b> Food.  *just as softly, knowing that's not the right answer*

<b>Marisol:</b> More basic.  *very quietly*  Inhale.

<b>Karl:</b> Air?

<b>Marisol:</b> *slow nod*  And what is love but air for the soul?  *still cupping your chin*  You and your mate are bound in all ways.  Always.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *soft, proud smile*  

<b>Marisol:</b> They you already know how they can all be bound.  *smiles*  And you don't need me.  *standing, then wobbling*  Oh, my.  I think I'm drunk.  *sitting back down just as abruptly*

<b>Karl:</b> Marisol, I do need you.  *automatically reaching to steady you*  You're the expert on Thracian bonds.  *eyes you*  And yes, you're drunk.

<b>Marisol:</b> It's alright, I won't always be.  *sweet smile*  Now, where were we?

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath, not completely convinced*  Why doesn't the bond exist in this body?  The one to Harry does, and has since the second I shifted.

<b>Marisol:</b> Well, now, your soul belongs to him, doesn't it?  Male, female, cat, sheep...your soul is still the same.  *wrinkling my nose*  You can't have that with more than one person, now, can you?

<b>Karl:</b> *gives you an indignant look at the sheep comment*  Then why do both bonds exist when I'm in my body?  But not in this one.

<b>Marisol:</b> Cause you did bind yourself to your son....just not a soul bond.  *bright smile*  It wasn't yours to give away.  You'd given it to Harry centuries ago.

<b>Karl:</b> Then what is it?  *just barely above a whisper*

<b>Marisol:</b> I don't know.  Whatever he did, he twisted.  All in bright, tiny ribbons.

<b>Karl:</b> *rubbing my eyes, more confused now than before*  Can you at least tell me how it was possible for him to do this to me?  He said he used your blood.

<b>Marisol:</b> My blood?  *blinks*  Oh, I don't think so.  I'm ashes, bled into the earth long before you were born.

<b>Karl:</b> That's what I was afraid of.  *suddenly tired, shoulders slumping as I look down*

<b>Marisol:</b> What's that?  *watching you*

<b>Karl:</b> He lied to me about it.

<b>Marisol:</b> And this surprises you?

<b>Karl:</b> Not really.  *small voice*

<b>Marisol:</b> *sympathy lacing my every word*  He wanted Harry destroyed, along with everything he loved.  All you could ever be was a means to an end, no matter what you felt or what he said.

<b>Karl:</b> *turns away, arms wrapped around my waist, wind tugging at my hair...I knew this...I KNEW it...so why does it hurt so much?*  *quietly*  Thank you for your help, Marisol.

<b>Marisol:</b> Anytime.  *lacing our fingers together*  I'm sorry.  Truly.

<b>Karl:</b> It's not your fault.  *softly*  But thank you.

<b>Marisol:</b> You're welcome.  *faster than a blink, we're back in your study*

<b>Karl:</b> *cradling the kids in my arms, watching in silence as the camera appears*

<b>Marisol:</b> Ready?  *holding out a hand*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *softly, placing my hand in yours, studying the contrasts there*

<b>Marisol:</b> *squeezing your fingers*  Name her after me.  *sinking quickly into the bond, already slipping away*

<b>Karl:</b> Her?  *confused because I know who you're talking about, but I'm not...*  *shakes my head, bond moving on its own to pull Harry back*

<b>Harry:</b> *snapping back, blinking to clear my head*  whoa...

<b>Karl:</b> *hand tight in yours, watching you, kids secure in the crook of my other arm*

<b>Harry:</b> um...woozy.  *slumping back in my chair, glancing down blurrily at our joined hands*  wh-wha' happen'?  *tongue feels all fuzzy, too thick*

<b>Karl:</b> *hides my smile, letting the kids down when they wake up and sleepily complain*  Marisol showed up and we had a bit of a chat.  All on tape.

<b>Harry:</b> ohgood... *shaking my head...still fuzzy.  the fuck?*

<b>Karl:</b> Take it easy, love.  *softly, watching you*

<b>Harry:</b> why?  *sweet, drunken smile, trying to stand & falling back again when the earth shifts*

<b>Karl:</b> Standing probably isn't a good idea just yet.  *soft smile*  Marisol had a...few drinks.

<b>Harry:</b> oh, i'm drunk?  *nods knowingly*  okay.  *pulling you into my lap*

<b>Karl:</b> *hands linked behind your neck as I shift to a comfortable position*  Very drunk.  Which means you won't remember anything that happened if I tell you.

<b>Harry:</b> might.  *nuzzling your neck*  mmm...tastenice...

<b>Karl:</b> *giggles softly...christ, I've NEVER been ticklish there...*  Okay then...to sum it up...apparently I've shifted so I /can/ have a child, the, um, other bond doesn't exist in this body because it's not a soul bond, I'm not diabetic in this body either, and Marisol's blood wasn't used...  *trails off, giggling again as your fingers wander over my ribs*

<b>Harry:</b> you're pretty.  *smiles at you, tickling lightly at your sides, tip of my tongue lapping at the curve of neck and shoulder*  like it when you laugh.

<b>Karl:</b> *right...knew you'd be too drunk to register what I said, but...*  Thank you.  *smiles, giggling again when your fingers find several ticklish spots, shifting against you when your tongue slides over my collarbone*

<b>Harry:</b> love you.  *another smile, blindingly bright, then tilting your head to the side, parting soft lips with my tongue, one hand bunching your shirt up in my fist*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue slipsliding along yours, fingers sinking deep in your hair as I press against you*

<b>Harry:</b> bedroom?  *hopeful look, trying to tug your shirt over your head, but unwilling to let go of your lips*

<b>Karl:</b> *half tempted to make some smart comment about there being a desk right here, but I refrain, pulling back enough so you can get my shirt off, shaking my head as my hair tumbles free of it*  Bedroom.

<b>Harry:</b> *tangling my hands in the glorious mass of hair, diving in for another scorching kiss*  needmouthonyou...now.

<b>Karl:</b> *barely a flicker of thought and we're in the bedroom...hmm, I can see where that's going to be VERY useful...tugging your head up and smiling into your eyes*  What's stopping you?

<b>Harry:</b> *slow, wide grin, quickly stripping you of the rest of your clothes and pushing you back on the bed, curved over you, nibbling and licking on your neck*

<b>Karl:</b> *fingers trailing along your back as I shift under you, your clothes rough against my skin as you move, lips and tongue tracing a wet trail down my throat*

<b>Harry:</b> *smiles, licking my lips, blowing cool air across one puckered nipple*  know what i'm going to do to you?

<b>Karl:</b> *shivers, barely managing not to gasp at the sensation*  What?

<b>Harry:</b> *tongue flicking out, tasting sweetly blushing skin*  everything.

<b>Karl:</b> *very soft whimper, arching up just a little, fingers clutching your shoulders*  Oh...really?

<b>Harry:</b> mmhmm... *lips closing around your nipple and drawing it deep in my mouth*

<b>Karl:</b> *breathless moan...fuck, I'm NEVER going to get used to that...one hand tangling in your hair*  Promise?

<b>Harry:</b> *finding your hand with mine, linking fingers together, and the look in my eyes is full of dark need*  promise.  *and i lower my lips, intent on delivering all that and more*

<b>Karl:</b> *shifting beneath you, squeezing your fingers, every muscle in my body soon trembling, silently begging for more, for everything, and knowing perfectly well that you're going to give it to me*"

"event","<font size=1>[occurs the day after the wedding...yes, there WAS a wedding night (very much NC17), no, they weren't willing to share it with the world...suffice to say that the bond did something REALLY funky, Karl changed back to male form for a bit of it, things worked out, and now he's back in female form...this is what happens the next afternoon]</font>

<lj-cut text=""In which Karl & Harry discuss several things that have happened in the last 24 hours, Karl makes a decision, and the boys plan another trip..."">
<b>Karl:</b> *reapplying sunscreen to my legs, then picking Vidam back up, stroking her fur while I talk softly to her, trying to convey through our tenuous bond how much I love & cherish her, smiling as Szoros snorts in his sleep and rolls over to his back, sprawled out, tummy bare*

<b>Harry:</b> *dropping on the blanket next to you, rubbing szoros' belly, and shaking my head slightly in an attempt to get some of the excess salt water out of it*

<b>Karl:</b> She's doing better.  *smiling up at you, sunglasses perched on the tip of my nose*

<b>Harry:</b> Good.  *soft smile, rolling to my side, still petting the snoozing szoros*  Think you just shocked her more than anything else.

<b>Karl:</b> I didn't mean to.  *glancing down and rolling my eyes when Szoros starts to snore...he's awful loud for such a little thing sometimes*

<b>Harry:</b> I know you didn't.  *chuckling when vidam creeps out of your arms to bat szoros over the head & snuggles next to him*  Think she just told him to quiet the fuck down.  

<b>Karl:</b> He listened, too.  *smiles, fingers sliding over soft fur, glancing up at you*  It's never been that strong before.

<b>Harry:</b> I could tell.  *slight frown*  Felt it myself.

<b>Karl:</b> You did?  *startled, hand pausing*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  Like an echo or maybe a memory.  It was odd.

<b>Karl:</b> That's never happened before.  *frowning a bit*  You shouldn't feel it.

<b>Harry:</b> A lot of things shouldn't be happening but are.  *quietly*

<b>Karl:</b> *just nods, looking down at the kids who are both asleep*

<b>Harry:</b> *finding your hand, lacing our fingers together*  You alright?

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *managing a small smile when I look back up*  Just...this is all so strange...and new...and I feel odd, but in a good way...just wish I knew what was going on.

<b>Harry:</b> Makes two of us.  *small smile*  Happier than I've ever been, but this is a bit...freaked out.

<b>Karl:</b> Just a bit?

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe a bit more.

<b>Karl:</b> Thought so.  *smiles a little*  So...guess we've got some things to talk about.

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, I guess we do.  *staring at our hands*  Starting with what you said yesterday after the wedding.

<b>Karl:</b> *nods*  Kinda figured that'd be first.

<b>Harry:</b> Wanna talk about it?

<b>Karl:</b> We need to.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> *clutching your hand, short nod*  So, um.  Talk.

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath*  I don't really know where to start.

<b>Harry:</b> I don't either.  *glancing at you*  But you need to start somewhere.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *half smile, looking down at the kids*  Well...I probably should have told you right away, but...we were so happy and things were going great and I didn't want to ruin that...

<b>Harry:</b> Told me what right away?

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath, speaking quickly & quietly*  I can't feel it in this body.

<b>Harry:</b> *rubbing a hand over my eyes*  You know, I'd... *stops, taking a deep breath*  Saying it doesn't make any sense isn't going to help.  Please...keep going.

<b>Karl:</b> There's not much to tell.  *quietly*  Just that...I knew it was there, almost like instinct, but I couldn't feel it.  And then yesterday...when the bond did whatever the hell it did...

<b>Harry:</b> Go on.  What?

<b>Karl:</b> *swallows, peeks up at you*  The instinct like feeling...vanished.

<b>Harry:</b> *tightly controlled voice*  You can't feel him.

<b>Karl:</b> *looks down again, shaking my head*

<b>Harry:</b> I see.  *starting out across the ocean, squeezing your hand*

<b>Karl:</b> *bites my bottom lip, glancing at you before looking back down at the kids*

<b>Harry:</b> So, um... *still staring out* ...where'd it go?

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know.  *glancing at you again*  It just...went away.  Like it was never there.

<b>Harry:</b> *faint frown*  You had a Thracian bond.  They don't just go away.

<b>Karl:</b> I know that, Harry.  *quietly*  But I'm not Thracian...and he wasn't full-blooded.

<b>Harry:</b> Then why were you able to feel it at all after he died?

<b>Karl:</b> *looks directly at you*  I *don't* know.  I don't know anything about bonds or how they work or what I should and shouldn't feel.  I just know what I do feel.

<b>Harry:</b> Well, I don't have any answers.  Your bond...your bond with him should be eternal.  Regardless of your lack of Thracian blood.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't have any answers, either.  *softly, voice breaking a bit*

<b>Harry:</b> *slow, deep breath*  I'm sorry.

<b>Karl:</b> For what?  *watching the kids shift in their sleep*

<b>Harry:</b> Everything, maybe.  *squint as the sun bursts from behind a small cloud*  Not protecting you, not saving him... lot of things.

<b>Karl:</b> You're not to blame for everything.  *quietly, looking out over the water*

<b>Harry:</b> No, my son...and you...hold plenty of blame.  *my fingers are going numb from holding onto yours, but i don't dare let go*  doesn't make my blame any less.

<b>Karl:</b> I've apologized for that.  Repeatedly.  *soft sigh*  I wasn't trying to put blame on anyone.

<b>Harry:</b> No, you're just expecting answers from me when I have none to give you.  *turning my head to look at you*  I'm not God, love.  I don't have any idea what's going on.  And maybe I never did.

<b>Karl:</b> I wasn't expecting you to have all the answers.  *quietly*

<b>Harry:</b> *just as quietly, not looking away*  Yes.  You were.

<b>Karl:</b> No.  *shakes my head*  I wasn't.  I thought that maybe we could try to figure it out together.  But you're asking me questions I don't have an answer to.

<b>Harry:</b> You were with him however many months.  I was dead.  If anyone has answers, it's going to be you, love.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't have the answers, Harry.  I thought that bond was permanent.  But it's not there in this body.  And I don't have the first clue about what all he did.

<b>Harry:</b> I don't, either.  *shrugs*  But, you know, he wouldn't tell me if I was the last person on earth.  His hatred for me fueled his entire soul.

<b>Karl:</b> He wouldn't tell me, either.  *sighs*

<b>Harry:</b> Then I guess we'll never know.  

<b>Karl:</b> Guess not.  *quietly, pulling my knees up & resting my chin on them*

<b>Harry:</b> What would you have me do, epeai?  *picking up a shell & skipping it across the waves*  I can't bring him back.  I don't know what he did.  I'm useless here.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't WANT you to bring him back.  *looking directly at you*  As for what I'd have you do...I'd like for US to try to figure this out.  Together.

<b>Harry:</b> *sighs*  He has answers.  I don't.  I didn't mean...

<b>Karl:</b> He won't give me the answers, Sin.  *quietly*  Because he knows I'll give them to you.  I tried.  The most I got was that he used Marisol's blood for the curse.

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, but Marisol can't shift.  *small smile*  Be different if we even knew what he used to get to you.

<b>Karl:</b> He never told me that.  *shifting a little closer to you*  And Marisol said I shouldn't be able to shift.

<b>Harry:</b> Well, you shouldn't.  Thracians don't & he's half Thracian & Marisol's full-blooded Thracian.  *putting my arm around your shoulders when you start to shiver a bit*  Best guess is he lied to you.  He was good at that.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *shifting again, curling against your side*  But if it wasn't Marisol's blood...what was it?  And how do we explain the earth bond I have now?

<b>Harry:</b> Your bond with him, your bond with me, he may have used a drop or two of Marisol's blood, I don't know.  *stroking your hair*  We definitely need to do some research.

<b>Karl:</b> Soon.  *quietly*  Because as much as I wish it had never existed...to have it just up and vanish is more than a little frightening.  And what happened with Vidam...

<b>Harry:</b> Soon as you'd like to leave.  

<b>Karl:</b> *very softly*  M'scared to leave here, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> *whispering in your hair*  Me too.

<b>Karl:</b> *twists in your arms, ending up half in your lap, arms wrapped tight around you*  Don't want this to end.  *whispers*

<b>Harry:</b> *holding you as tight as i can*  It won't.  Never leaving you.

<b>Karl:</b> But this feeling...this happiness...it'll leave.  *sadly, head on your shoulder*  Always does when we go home.

<b>Harry:</b> Not if we work at it.  *tilting your chin up*  And we're going to work at it.

<b>Karl:</b> I want to.  *softly, looking at you*  I want to make this work so badly, Harry.

<b>Harry:</b> Makes two of us.

<b>Karl:</b> Well, we've made a bit of a start on it.  *half smile, looking down at my hand and the rings there*  We're bonded *and* married.  Figure hell'll freeze over before we could untangle all that.

<b>Harry:</b> I don't care if hell *does* freeze over.  *smiling at you*  I'll just unfreeze it.

<b>Karl:</b> You would, too.  *laughs*

<b>Harry:</b> You bet.

<b>Karl:</b> *sobers, looking down at Vidam curled around Szoros, both of them so peaceful & innocent*  Harry...do you have any ideas about why...

<b>Harry:</b> Why...you're bound to them?  *following your look*

<b>Karl:</b> No.  Yesterday.  When I tried to stop Vidam...  *looks up*  It's never been that strong before.  Ever.  Usually they just stop and look at me.  But that...it was like...like she ran headfirst into a wall.

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know.  Unless she's feeling me now.

<b>Karl:</b> It scared me...I could have hurt her.  *trying to remain calm*  I could have hurt her badly.

<b>Harry:</b> But you didn't.  *rubbing your back*  She's fine, love.

<b>Karl:</b> She is now.  *softly*  But she's been very docile all day.

<b>Harry:</b> She'll be alright.  *small smile*  She loves you.  She knows you'd never hurt her.

<b>Karl:</b> I wouldn't.  Ever.  *smiling a little as I watch them sleep*  I love her so much, Sin.  Szoros, too.

<b>Harry:</b> I know you do.  *kissing your forehead*  Just keep a tight leash on your thoughts around them.  Best I can tell you.

<b>Karl:</b> I'll try.  But I'm so used to being able to just let go with them.

<b>Harry:</b> *softly*  Until we learn why this has happened, you won't be able to.  

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe if I'm really careful?  *looks up at you hopefully*

<b>Harry:</b> You wanna take that chance with them?  *stroking your cheek softly*

<b>Karl:</b> No, but...  *softly, trailing off, blinking as I look down*

<b>Harry:</b> *rubbing my lips over your hair*  M'sorry, love.  Wish I could give you what you want.

<b>Karl:</b> *just nods, petting both kids as they curl & uncurl in their sleep*

<b>Harry:</b> *placing my hand over your, running fingers through soft fur, holding you close with my other arm, wishing i could do more*

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe if I don't focus so hard?  *quietly, head on your shoulder*  I was concentrating pretty hard yesterday.

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly*  Use your best judgement, love.  I can't tell you what to do.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know what to do.  *just as quietly, looking up at you with sad eyes*  I don't want to hurt them, but...I'm so used to 'talking' to them.

<b>Harry:</b> *gently pushing your hair behind your ear*  Things change.  And you know you can't risk hurting them again until we know what's going on.

<b>Karl:</b> What if we never find out?  *voice muffled as I turn in your arms, face pressed against your neck, trying not to cry*

<b>Harry:</b> *simply holding you, petting your back*  I don't know.  *soft murmur*

<b>Karl:</b> They won't understand.  *biting my bottom lip, not moving*  They're so used to what we have.

<b>Harry:</b> They'll adapt, love.  *nuzzling behind your ear*  You still have them.

<b>Karl:</b> *just nods, sniffling softly as a few tears escape, trying to control myself because I don't want to wake them*

<b>Harry:</b> *holding you, still stroking your back, unable to think of anything to say to ease your pain*

<b>Karl:</b> *finally breathing in deep, shaky breaths, reaching up to wipe my eyes*  Maybe we can figure out something.

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.  *kissing each damp eyelid*  Love you, epaei.  It'll be alright.

<b>Karl:</b> Love you, too.  *softly, leaning into your touch*  Harry...about last night...

<b>Harry:</b> *slightly tensing, but pressing a kiss to your lips*  Yeah?

<b>Karl:</b> Don't suppose you have any ideas about that, huh?

<b>Harry:</b> Not really.  *glancing down at the blanket*  Just knew I /needed/.  Don't remember ever needing like that.  Not too sure I like it.

<b>Karl:</b> It was a little frightening.  *quietly, lacing our fingers together, trying to reassure you through our bond*  But at least we know I can shift at will.

<b>Harry:</b> *squeezing your fingers*  Good to know.  *murmuring*  M'sorry about the other, though.  I know it wasn't what you wanted.

<b>Karl:</b> Shifting back to my real body?  *small shrug*  No worries.

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, okay.  *shrugs*  No worries.

<b>Karl:</b> Harry...  *softly*  I'm sorry.  I didn't...I told myself I wasn't going to let it bother me today.

<b>Harry:</b> Bothers me, why wouldn't it bother you?

<b>Karl:</b> Because I don't want to add to your worries.  *soft sigh*  Yes, it's bothering me.  And it upset me a little last night.

<b>Harry:</b> Wasn't exactly thrilled with it myself.  *shrugs again*  Not quite how I'd planned to spend my evening.

<b>Karl:</b> No, I know it wasn't.  *glances up at you*  If you'd rather not discuss it, just tell me.

<b>Harry:</b> Didn't say that.  *catching your gaze*  Just don't know what to say except I'm sorry.

<b>Karl:</b> It wasn't your fault.  *soft smile*  Wasn't mine, either.  Seems this bond we have has a mind of its own.

<b>Harry:</b> Which worries me.  

<b>Karl:</b> I take it that it's not supposed to do things like that.

<b>Harry:</b> Um, no.  *brief, humorless smile*  It's not.

<b>Karl:</b> Didn't think so..  *pauses for a moment, thinking*  Don't suppose it might have something to do with the fact that I'm not Thracian.

<b>Harry:</b> What, it made you fuck me because you're not like me?  *frowns*  That makes even less sense than it forcing us to have sex.

<b>Karl:</b> No, no...  *quickly, aware that I'm fucking this up badly*  Just...maybe it needs more to complete itself.  Or something.  I don't know...I'm grasping at straws here.

<b>Harry:</b> Oh.  *ponders that for a minute*  Could be.  Or maybe it's because you were mortal.  Soulmate bonds are normally made with another immortal.  Bonded with you in both sexes, remember?

<b>Karl:</b> That's what I meant.  *pulling my knees up again, chin resting on them*  I wasn't mortal...and you hadn't bonded with this body until yesterday.

<b>Harry:</b> Bonded with your male body, though.  *stretching out over the blanket, looking up at the billowy clouds*  Why I don't understand what happened last night.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know.  Maybe it had to restake it's claim or something.  Maybe it's just a perverse bastard with a shitty sense of timing.

<b>Harry:</b> *shrugs*  You weren't the one it... *pause* ...no, I'm not going to use that word.

<b>Karl:</b> What?  *looks at you*

<b>Harry:</b> *swallowing hard*  Rape.  *sighs*  Because it wasn't at the time.  Just feels like it today.

<b>Karl:</b> No, Harry.  *softly, but firmly, twisting to kneel beside you, one hand on your chest, bond pulsing softly between us*  That word has NOTHING to do with our relationship.  Ever.

<b>Harry:</b> *short, jerky nod, twisting a little to curl around you*  I know.  And I wanted it -- wanted you so much -- but I couldn't *control* the want.  *glancing up at you*  I'd have been content to wait until today to have you like that or you have me.

<b>Karl:</b> I know you would have, love.  *softly, flooding the bond with everything I feel, a little stunned at how intense it gets*

<b>Harry:</b> *pulling you down beside me, wrapping arms around a slender waist, nuzzling your neck, almost overwhelmed at how open the bond is, how much of you i feel, how much loveneedwant there is between us*  

<b>Karl:</b> That's...a lot there...  *a little shaken by just how much there is, body automatically shifting to align with yours*

<b>Harry:</b> Lifetimes... *murmurs, trying to pull you in closer*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah...  *hands sliding along your back, careful not to move too far as the kids are still curled up very close by*  Forever...

<b>Harry:</b> Forever.

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath, looking up at you*  Harry...what are the odds that we can find answers in Bulgaria?

<b>Harry:</b> All of them?  *slowly*  Not likely.  Some, yes.  And maybe we'll get pointed in a right direction on the rest.

<b>Karl:</b> I'd like to find the answers.  And...  *hesitates*  Other things.  So we can get on with our lives and planning a family.

<b>Harry:</b> *looking at you*  What other things?

<b>Karl:</b> *several minutes pass before I speak, and when I do, I look up, meeting your eyes & taking a deep breath*  I want to find out if there's some way to break my bond with Lawrence.

<b>Harry:</b> *the word is out before i can stop it*  Why?

<b>Karl:</b> Because it never should have happened.  *quietly, bond swirling slowly inside me, at peace*  And while I loved him...he was never my soulmate, never the person I was meant to be with...and I don't want anything between us.

<b>Harry:</b> *softly, searching your eyes*  Are you certain, epaei?  To break a Thracian bond -- an unbreakable bond... *deep breath*  If we can find someone who remembers the ancient ways of reversal...you'll forget him.  Forget what you had with him.  It's the only way you'll survive it.

<b>Karl:</b> Forget him entirely?  *quietly, thinking that over*  Or just...the bond and all that?

<b>Harry:</b> Everything from the second the bond was made.  Everything.

<b>Karl:</b> I'll remember everything before then?  Because...whatever else he was...he was my friend before everything went to hell.  I...I'd like to remember that.  *meets your eyes*  But not the rest of it.

<b>Harry:</b> Not the rest.  *very faint frown, rubbing a hand along your arm*  Are you doing this for me or you, love?

<b>Karl:</b> For both of us.  *managing a very small smile*  So we can be free and happy again.  And because I can't continue living with both bonds.

<b>Harry:</b> He'll try to stop you.  *quietly*  He's still part-Thracian.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm stronger than I was before.  *just as quietly*  And I'm trusting you to help me.  I need to do this, Harry.  The double bond...I can't.

<b>Harry:</b> I understand.  *small smile*  Why I never thought about bonding with Marton.  I belonged to you.

<b>Karl:</b> And I belong to you.  *reaching out to take your hand*  Maybe...maybe what happened yesterday will make it easier.

<b>Harry:</b> I hope so.  *lacing our fingers together*  I can't lose you again.

<b>Karl:</b> You won't.  I promise.  *my free hand touches your cheek, fingers slipping over stubble*  And it's got to be better than living with the pain...  *stops, leaning in quickly to kiss you*

<b>Harry:</b> *allowing the kiss for a moment before pulling back*  What pain, epaei?  *curling your hair behind your ear again*

<b>Karl:</b> The double bond.  *softly, trying to smile*  You could block it...I can't.  Never been able to.  Almost killed me when you came back, before he died.

<b>Harry:</b> May have been what he wanted, you know.

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe.  I don't know.  I just...I can't feel it in this body.  *looking at you, hoping you understand*  But in my real body...it's painful sometimes.

<b>Harry:</b> *nods*  No promises.  But we'll do what we can.

<b>Karl:</b> That's all I ask.  *quietly*  I don't want it anymore.  Just yours.  Ours.

<b>Harry:</b> Alright.  *brushing my lips over yours*  

<b>Karl:</b> *cradling your face in my hands, searching your eyes*  You believe me, don't you?

<b>Harry:</b> Yes.  *quietly, placing my hands over yours*  I do.

<b>Karl:</b> Good.  *relieved smile*  Because I meant every word of it.  I've messed things up enough...time I did something right for me.  And for you.

<b>Harry:</b> *smiles* We'll get it right together.

<b>Karl:</b> I know we will.  *smiling, fingers tracing your face*  I have every faith in us to not only get it right, but get it perfect this time, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> So do I, love.  *soft kiss, still smiling*  So do I."

<b>Harry:</b> *the second everyone's left, i sink to the sand, cradling you in my arms, legs unable to support me any longer*  Whoa.

<b>Karl:</b> *trembling in your lap, clinging to you*  Answers that question...  *mumbles*

<b>Harry:</b> Which was...? *stroking your back, feeling the bond ebb and pulse with that same strange new light*

<b>Karl:</b> If you knew that was gonna happen.  *quietly, still trembling, resisting the urge to look too closely at the bond*

<b>Harry:</b> Not remotely.  That was just... *deep breath* ...I've never felt anything like this.

<b>Karl:</b> It's seamless now.  *softly, finally looking at it, awareness slipping around the curves and spirals*  And it just...flows...into yours...

<b>Harry:</b> Complete.  *nods*  Like it's always been like this.

<b>Karl:</b> Complete...  *almost as if I'm speaking to myself, eyes focused on the waves, still trembling a little*  Singular...

<b>Harry:</b> *kissing your forehead, still sliding my hands along your back*  What're you thinking, love?

<b>Karl:</b> Hmmm?  *blinks, looking up at you*  Oh, nothing really.

<b>Harry:</b> Looked pretty intent for nothing.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh.  Um...  *flushes a bit and looks down*  Hasn't felt like this in...a while.

<b>Harry:</b> What'd you mean?  *faint frown*

<b>Karl:</b> The bond.  *quickly, mind racing as I smile at you*  It's quiet.

<b>Harry:</b> No, it's not, it's practically vibrating.  You can't feel it?

<b>Karl:</b> No, I can.  *softly as the breeze catches a few tendrils of hair and tugs them across my face*

<b>Harry:</b> *pushing the hairs back behind your ear*  So what'd you mean by it's quiet, then?

<b>Karl:</b> It's not in contention anymore.  *so softly it's almost a whisper, ignoring the siren call of the bond's humming, knowing how easy it is to get lost in it*

<b>Harry:</b> It's not in... *trailing off, brain finally catching up with your words*  Karl, are you... *searching through our bond for yours with lawrence, mine with lawrence...and it's as if they've disappeared*

<b>Karl:</b> Singular...  *quietly, deep breath*  Harry, can we...can we talk about this...later...  *trying to put it off, knowing that now isn't really the best time to discuss this*

<b>Harry:</b> Whenever you'd like, love.  *yes, you're definitely right.  now isn't the best time.  today is supposed to be a celebration*  Can you stand now?  

<b>Karl:</b> I think so.  *taking a few deep breaths*  Tomorrow.  We'll talk about it then.

<b>Harry:</b> Tomorrow sounds lovely.  *small, intimate smile, sliding my hands along your thighs*  Have I told you that you look lovely today?

<b>Karl:</b> No, you haven't.  *smiles, flushing, fingers twisting the hem of my sarong, glad I opted to have the maid do a simple style for my hair*

<b>Harry:</b> You look lovely.  Radiant, even.  *nuzzling just under your jaw*

<b>Karl:</b> Thank you.  *still smiling, eyes closed, hands resting on your shoulders*

<b>Harry:</b> I love you.  *kissing along your jaw to your waiting, parted lips, tongue slipping in to tease yours*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft sigh, tongue sliding along yours, fingers sinking into your hair as I shift a little, nestled securely in your lap*

<b>Harry:</b> *content to trade slow, deep kisses with you as the sun sets behind us, cool breeze blowing in from the ocean, ruffling my hair so it tangles with yours*

<b>Karl:</b> *resting against you, warm in your arms*  Thank you.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> For what?

<b>Karl:</b> Today.  *smiles up at you*

<b>Harry:</b> *smiles*  My pleasure, my love.

<b>Karl:</b> They're probably wondering where we are.  *small smile, knowing we're going to have answer questions when we go inside...and now we're covered in sand*

<b>Harry:</b> Oh, I wouldn't be surprised if they think we've gone back to the hotel room already.  *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> The kids are highly indignant with us right now.  *soft laugh as you stand and pull me up, smiling as you try to brush the sand off*

<b>Harry:</b> They'll forgive us.  *lingering on your ass and thighs as i brush the sand off your sarong*  Probably getting spoiled by Ice right about now.

<b>Karl:</b> She seemed a bit...disturbed.  *chuckling as the bond glows softly and the sand drops from both of us*

<b>Harry:</b> Probably the first time she's been outshined by another female.  *winks, lacing our fingers together as we walk up to the hotel*

<b>Karl:</b> I didn't.  *blinks, looking up at you*  Did I?

<b>Harry:</b> Oh yeah... *nuzzling your neck*

<b>Karl:</b> Oh.  *blushes as you push open the door to the hotel*"

<lj-cut text=""And makes her cry..."">

<b>Harry:</b> *i wait until your breathing has evened out, content to simply hold you, delighting in how perfect you feel like this -- soft, feminine, mine.  but there are some things i need to take care of, so i roll out of bed, pressing a soft kiss to tousled hair as i pull on my jeans & pad out of the room, shirt & shoes in hand.  
 
 it's well over an hour later when i return, bags in tow, and i have to stop, drinking my fill of the sight of you, still asleep, lips parted, hand resting under your cheek.  the sheets have twisted, revealing glimpses of endless legs and golden skin, tempting beyond measure.  i set all the bags except one on the table next to the bed & swiftly undress, joining you under the covers once more.  you feel so incredible in my arms, so right, so fucking perfect.  like the last piece of the puzzle in my life has finally slipped into place.*

<b>Karl:</b> *sleepy murmur, curling deeper into the warmth of your arms, feeling safe and secure and loved as our bond wraps around me along with your arms*

<b>Harry:</b> Wake up, epaei... *nuzzling just behind your ear, slowly stroking the soft curve of your stomach*

<b>Karl:</b> *shivering a little at the light touch, lashes fluttering*  M'sleeping...

<b>Harry:</b> yes, but i have gifts.  *smiling, cupping one full breast in my hand, kissing your earlobe*

<b>Karl:</b> Gifts?  *definitely sounding a little more excited now, one eye opening to peek at you from beneath tangled hair*

<b>Harry:</b> yep, you're definitely a woman now. *wide grin, looking down at you*  shopping before sex.

<b>Karl:</b> *resists the urge to roll my eyes, then your hand does something and my eyes close again, lips parting*  Wh-what?

<b>Harry:</b> or not.  *tasting sleep-soft lips, nail brushing over your nipple again*

<b>Karl:</b> Harry, please...  *softly, hands finding your back, arching against you, vaguely amazed at the fact that this body seems to instinctively know how to move correctly*

<b>Harry:</b> *just a taste... lips moving slowly across your chest, suckling briefly on each nipple, tongue sliding over your stomach as i settle between your thighs*

<b>Karl:</b> *thighs slowly falling open for you, hands tangling in your hair, watching you through my lashes and whimpering quietly at the feel of your mouth moving over my skin*

<b>Harry:</b> *everything about you is softer -- skin, taste, smell -- like being surrounded by a garden in full spring bloom.  my tongue caresses the crease of your thigh & hip before licking between slick folds and pressing in*

<b>Karl:</b> *crying out softly, hips pressing up against your mouth, head falling back, knowing now why all my previous female selves would just smile mysteriously when they thought of sex because sweet jesus, you're going to kill me*

<b>Harry:</b> *humming quietly, tongue curling inside you as my lips close over your clit, sucking gently -- yeah, your cock is a beautiful thing, but i've really missed this*

<b>Karl:</b> *hips undulating against you in gentle movements, continuously moaning now, one hand tightening in your hair as the other slides up to cup a breast, thumb brushing over the nipple -- and yeah, I could get used to being woken up like this on a regular basis*

<b>Harry:</b> *pressing in deeper, slow slide in and out of slick heat, sucking harder on the tight nub, drowning in your musky, rich taste*

<b>Karl:</b> *your name's a soft cry as my entire body arches, splinters apart in a rush of heat and pleasure that leaves me breathless and boneless*

<b>Harry:</b> *still humming, lips dragging lazily back up your body, sharing your taste in my kiss, petting & soothing you as you tremble*

<b>Karl:</b> *clinging to you, realizing that, yes, that's what this body is SUPPOSED to do, tasting myself on your lips as your hands move gently over my skin*  *whispers*  Love you...

<b>Harry:</b> Love you more.  *smiles, rolling to your side, one leg resting firmly over yours*  Awake now?

<b>Karl:</b> Mmhmm.  *smiles, cuddling against you*

<b>Harry:</b> Good.  *grabbing the smallest package from the table & setting it on your stomach*  Open it.

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes you for a moment, then sits up, hair tumbling around my shoulders & down my back as I lift the package*  What is it?  *fingers moving to slowly unwrap it*

<b>Harry:</b> You'll see.  *mysterious smile when you see the jeweler's name etched on the box*

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks slowly at the name, then stares at you for a moment*  Jewelry?  *very slowly opens the box and almost drops it when I see what it holds, lips parting in stunned speechlessness*

<b>Harry:</b> *taking the <a href=http://www.fadedink.com/images/ring.jpg>ring</a> from the box & sliding it on -- a tiny bit big, but we can resize it.*  Karl.  *waiting until you turn big, beautiful eyes up to me, stroking your cheek with shaking fingers*  I had this whole speech about how you complete me in either form and how we could be legal now... but I don't remember it.  So, keeping it simple. *small smile*  Will you marry me?

<b>Karl:</b> *blinking rapidly, fingers curling tight to keep the ring in place -- and damn it, the room should NOT be getting blurry*  Yes...  *whispers*  Yes.  *louder this time, launching myself at you, arms wrapping around your neck*

<b>Harry:</b> *practically crushing you in my arms, pressing kisses to your hair*  Love you so much, epaei.  

<b>Karl:</b> *can feel the tears wetting my cheeks as I place soft kisses up your neck, still holding you very tightly*  Love you more...  *voice muffled in your hair*

<b>Harry:</b> *still holding you, throat closing, kissing the tears from your cheeks*  None of that, love.

<b>Karl:</b> M'sorry...  *fingers wipe at the tears, sapphire flashing in the light*

<b>Harry:</b> Don't be.  *soft smile, stroking wet cheeks*  

<b>Karl:</b> Dunno why I'm crying.  *soft sniffles, smiling at you as I crawl into your lap and curl up*

<b>Harry:</b> Hormones.  *still smiling, settling back against the headboard & pulling you with me, cradling you close*  

<b>Karl:</b> S'gonna take some getting used to.  *head resting on your shoulder, hand on your chest as I stare at the ring on my finger*  *very softly*  It's beautiful, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> Thought the sapphire was appropriate.  *lacing our fingers together, watching the light reflect the ring*

<b>Karl:</b> I like it.  *flashes a bright smile at you before kissing you gently*  Can't quite believe you bought it, though.

<b>Harry:</b> Whysat?

<b>Karl:</b> Just...dunno.  *delicate shrug, resting my head on your shoulder again*  Getting married never really figured into our plans.

<b>Harry:</b> We're just as good as married.  *kissing your forehead*  New Zealand recognizes what we did in Bulgaria & that's all that counts.

<b>Karl:</b> I know, but still...  *small smile, snuggling closer*  You didn't have to ask.

<b>Harry:</b> Completing the bond.  *stroking your back*

<b>Karl:</b> Is that it?  *curious, looking up at you*

<b>Harry:</b> What?

<b>Karl:</b> What it'll take to complete the bond?

<b>Harry:</b> I'm guessing the marriage vows themselves.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh.  *looking back down at the ring, arching into your hand as it slides up & down my back*  Makes sense, I guess.

<b>Harry:</b> I hope you don't mind a short engagement.  *smiles, massaging your shoulders*

<b>Karl:</b> How short?

<b>Harry:</b> Does tomorrow work for you?

<b>Karl:</b> But I want a dress...  *trailing off as my eyes go wide and I slap a hand over my mouth -- I did NOT just say that, I didn't, I didn't*

<b>Harry:</b> *chuckles*  Fine, we can wait a few days for you to go shopping.  

<b>Karl:</b> No, no, tomorrow's fine.  *voice muffled through my fingers*

<b>Harry:</b> *completely straight expression*  No, you're right.  Every bride deserves to have a dress.

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes you*  Very funny.

<b>Harry:</b> Don't suppose a sarong would do?  Or a leather mini-skirt complete with boots?

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  A leather what??  With what?

<b>Harry:</b> *pointing to the other bags*  Went shopping.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks again, finally noticing the other bags*  Sin...

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah?  *sits up, smiling*

<b>Karl:</b> Those are for me?  *biting my lip, eyeing the bags*

<b>Harry:</b> Don't see anyone else here, do you?  *grinning widely at your expression*

<b>Karl:</b> *scrambles off the bed after the bags, then stopping and looking up at you with a somewhat contrite expression*  Um...can I open them now?

<b>Harry:</b> Please.  *settling back against the pillows*

<b>Karl:</b> *flashes you another bright smile as I settle down beside the bags, reaching for the first one*  Damn, Harry...did you buy out the entire country?

<b>Harry:</b> Didn't have enough time.  *small smile*  

<b>Karl:</b> Looks like you made a pretty good attempt.  *pulls a length of dark sapphire cloth out of the bag, noting that it's got a white design along one side of it*  A bedsheet?

<b>Harry:</b> It's a sarong, love.  I'll show you how to wear it in a minute.

<b>Karl:</b> It's pretty.  *smiles, studying it as I run the silky fabric through my hands*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, you are.  *watching you with an indulgent smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *looks up at you through my lashes, wondering if my face is half as red as it feels*  Thank you.  *softly, carefully folding the sarong and setting it aside before reaching for the next bag*

<b>Harry:</b> *hands folded, waiting patiently, content to merely watch you & admire your beauty*

<b>Karl:</b> Sin...  *carefully pulling what seems to be the world's smallest strip of black leather out of the bag and holding it up, eyeing it closely*  What is this supposed to cover?

<b>Harry:</b> Exactly what it needs to & nothing else.  *very wicked grin*

<b>Karl:</b> Well that's not going to be much.  *holding it this way and that, convinced there's no way in hell this is going to cover my ass*

<b>Harry:</b> Trust me.  

<b>Karl:</b> *just gives you a look*  Is there an itty bitty top to go with it, too?

<b>Harry:</b> Mmm...possibly.  *wondering if you have any idea how seductive you are like this*

<b>Karl:</b> Possibly?  Harry, I'll get arrested for indecent exposure if I go out in this.  *shakes the skirt at you for emphasis, then peers into the bag again...and yes, there does seem to be a top in there...probably microscopic if the skirt is anything to go by*

<b>Harry:</b> It's Rio, love.  We fuck on the beach.  No one's arresting anyone.

<b>Karl:</b> Mmhmm.  *pulls the top out of the bag and examines it*  Somehow...  *holds the top up to my breasts -- and I was right, damn thing isn't going to cover much at all...even less if I take a deep breath*  I just don't think you're going to be so willing that anyone else sees this body...

<b>Harry:</b> They can see it all they want.  *very calmly*  But it belongs only to me.

<b>Karl:</b> Of course it belongs only to you.  *soft smile*  Pretty sure this body was *designed* for you.  *reaches for the next bag*

<b>Harry:</b> *thinks over that possibility for a moment...there might be something to it...as i wait for you to open the next box*

<b>Karl:</b> *staring for a moment when I open the box, then slowly lifting out one boot and peering at you around it*

<b>Harry:</b> You seemed to admire them on Elena.  *watching you*

<b>Karl:</b> Well...they looked good on her.  *pulls the other boot out and studies them, noting the differences in the pair I have and the pair she was wearing*  I don't think I'm going to be able to move in them.

<b>Harry:</b> The point isn't to move in them, love.  It's just to be wearing them.  

<b>Harry:</b> Boots like that are their own fashion statement.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh really?  *very slow smile, looking back at the boots, then up at you*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *returning your smile*  

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe I should put 'em on now then....

<b>Harry:</b> Think we wouldn't be leaving the room if you did.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft laugh, setting the boots aside*  You say that like it's a bad thing, love.  *sidelong look as I reach for another bag*

<b>Harry:</b> Not bad at all.  *licking my lower lip*  Just trying to take it easy on you at first.

<b>Karl:</b> I heal fast.  *grinning before peering down into the bag*  Um...  *blinks a few times, then upends the bag in my lap, fingers sifting through the scraps of silk & lace that tumble out*

<b>Harry:</b> It's lingerie.  *hiding my smile behind my hand*

<b>Karl:</b> I know that.  *flashing you a dark look, then returning my attention to the small mountain of delicate -- and very practical in some case -- lingerie in my lap*

<b>Harry:</b> I assume you know how to put it on, yes?  *completely deadpan*

<b>Karl:</b> I know how to take it off.  *small frown, holding up a bra made of ruby silk*  Shouldn't be too hard to put it on.

<b>Harry:</b> I'll be more than happy to help.

<b>Karl:</b> Somehow, I think you'll be more hindrance than help, love.  *soft smile as I finish sorting them out, realizing that every single piece is made of silk and they're all pretty, as well as functional*

<b>Harry:</b> Are they to your liking, love?

<b>Karl:</b> They're beautiful.  *softly, holding a coral colored one up against my skin and looking at you*

<b>Harry:</b> *appreciative glance*  Very.

<b>Karl:</b> Thank you.  *bright smile, setting them all aside, trying to figure out which bag to tackle next...there are so many of them*

<b>Harry:</b> *waiting patiently, watching you in silent fascination -- you're still karl, still the same person -- but this new body has softened some of your edges, given you a depth i never knew you had.  it's completely fascinating*

<b>Karl:</b> *reaches for the next bag, then stops and looks up at you from beneath my hair*  What?

<b>Harry:</b> Just admiring.  *simply*

<b>Karl:</b> Mmhmm.  *smiles, wondering what you're thinking that has the bond pulsing softly -- then I peek inside the next bag and almost squeal in delight when I see denim*

<b>Harry:</b> Thought you'd appreciate some comfortable clothes.  *smiling at your obvious delight*

<b>Karl:</b> *smiling in delight as I pull everything out of the bag, one piece at a time -- jeans and shorts, and a quick peek in the next bag reveals assorted tops and t-shirts*

<b>Harry:</b> I did the best I could from memory.  *hoping everything fits*

<b>Karl:</b> You did great.  *smiles, then holds a pair of shorts up to my waist, studying them...yeah, looks like they'll fit*

<b>Harry:</b> Good.  *swinging my feet off the bed & standing*  I'll leave you to try everything on, then.  I've got a few phone calls to make.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh?  *quietly, looking up at you, hand resting on one of the last two bags*

<b>Harry:</b> You need some new identification, love.  *caressing your cheek as i walk past*

<b>Karl:</b> Oh.  *still quietly, pulling the last two bags over and looking through them -- sandals, a pair of Birkenstocks -- you know me entirely too well -- and...things...for my hair, I assume, as I examine one of the clips...and make-up...hoo boy*

<b>Harry:</b> *quickly making the requisite calls to my source here in rio, ordering a new birth certificate & lisence to be delivered by this afternoon -- and another one to my lawyer, changing a few legal ties*

<b>Karl:</b> *busy trying on the clothes, smiling when each one fits perfectly, taking a few minutes to admire the way the shorts make my legs look, leaving the sarong and the leather outfit for last...partially because I have NO idea what to do with the sarong*

<b>Harry:</b> *coming back into the room a few minutes later, giving a low whistle at you in the shorts & some small, stretchy top*  Very nice.

<b>Karl:</b> *whirling around, practically bouncing across the room to wrap around you, covering your face with tiny kisses*  Everything fits perfectly.

<b>Harry:</b> *very happily finding myself with an armful of female*  I'm glad you're pleased, love.

<b>Karl:</b> I am.  *smiles in delight as I unwrap myself*  I, um...

<b>Harry:</b> *reluctantly letting you go*  Yes?

<b>Karl:</b> *scuffing bare toes on the carpet as I pull the sarong from the bed*  I have no clue how this goes on.

<b>Harry:</b> *picking up the scrap of silk*  C'mere & I'll show you.  *soft smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *quickly shimmying out of the shorts & top, flushing a little as I stand there, clad in the coral silk set*

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly unsnapping the bra, trailing my fingers over soft skin as it falls from your shoulders*  You won't need that.

<b>Karl:</b> Just put it on so I could...you know...see how the shirts fit...  *quietly, shivering a little under your touch*

<b>Harry:</b> Okay.  *wrapping the sarong around you, caressing each inch of skin as i cover it up, tucking in the folds*

<b>Karl:</b> *watches silently in the full length mirror, paying attention to the way it drapes and to the way you fasten it, holding my hair up when you direct me to*  The material is gorgeous.

<b>Harry:</b> Suits you.  *placing a light kiss on your neck*

<b>Karl:</b> *letting my hair go, still watching in the mirror as it tumbles around my shoulders, breath catching in my throat at the look in your eyes*  Sin...

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah?  *hands skimming the material as they slide up your sides & rest just under your breasts*

<b>Karl:</b> *biting my bottom lip, eyes wide as they meet yours in the mirror*  *small voice*  I want to get married in this.

<b>Harry:</b> Alright.  *smiles, kissing your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> *twisting in your arms to wrap my arms around your waist, hugging you tightly*

<b>Harry:</b> *holding you close, wondering what i ever did to get so lucky as to deserve you*

<b>Karl:</b> Love you so much.  *whispers, lifting my head, smiling up at you as your lips cover mine*

<b>Harry:</b> *trading slow, drugging kisses with you, sliding the sarong off your shoulder*

<b>Karl:</b> *shivering a little as the material slips down my body, leaving me clad in just barely there coral silk panties, lifting my arms to twine them around your neck, raising up just a bit on my tiptoes*

<b>Harry:</b> How does an afternoon in sound?  *pressing you close to me, breasts crushed against my chest, cupping your ass & gently squeezing*

<b>Karl:</b> Sounds lovely.  *smiling up at you, amazed at how delicate & fragile I feel next to you now*  Gonna show me how to use the rest of that stuff?

<b>Harry:</b> *Slow smile, walking you backwards towards the bed*  Eventually.

<b>Karl:</b> Didn't try on those yet.  *nods towards the skirt & boots, letting you guide me*

<b>Harry:</b> Later, I promise.  *following you when you fall backward on the bed, covering your body with mine*

<b>Karl:</b> *smiles, hands sliding up your back as my thighs part to cradle your hips*  And you'll show me what to do with the hair thingies and the make-up, too?

<b>Harry:</b> Everything... *slow, grinding kiss, reaching for the box of condoms on the bedside table*

<b>Karl:</b> Gonna hold you to that.  *slow smile, one hand working between us to curl around you, nudging you over to your back*

<b>Harry:</b> *thrusting up into your tight fist, quietly handing you the condom*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft, wicked laugh*  You're not gonna need that....

<b>Harry:</b> Oh?  *tangling my hands in your hair, pulling you to me for another slow kiss*

<b>Karl:</b> Nope.  *smiles, biting your bottom lip before pulling back, body draped over yours as I lick a slow path down your neck*

<b>Harry:</b> *twisting my body to follow the wet, hot path of your tongue, tightening my fingers in your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles, mapping each inch of your chest with my mouth, tongue circling first one nipple, then the other, teasing them with tiny licks*

<b>Harry:</b> *shivering under your gentle tongue, helplessly enthralled by how different -- yet how much the same -- your touch feels*

<b>Karl:</b> *nails raking lightly over your stomach and thighs as I very slowly slide lower, licking every bit of bare skin, hair dragging over your body*

<b>Harry:</b> *twisting, moaning... you're torturing me, but it feels so good to be at your mercy this way, to allow myself to relax under your assured hands and mouth*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue flickering over your balls as my hands slide up your thighs, loving the friction of crisp hairs under my palms*

<b>Harry:</b> *soft gasp, thighs falling apart to give you access*

<b>Karl:</b> *another soft chuckle as I slide my tongue up your length, careful to make sure the stud drags over sensitive ridges*

<b>Harry:</b> *definitely trying to kill me...thrusting my hips up into the sweet heat of your mouth, gasping when the stud slides along the head of my cock*

<b>Karl:</b> *smiling around you, humming softly as I adjust to the familiar feel of you in my now smaller mouth, settling in an easy rhythm, stud dragging over you randomly*

<b>Harry:</b> *low whimpergrowl as i slide deep in your throat, holding your head in place so i can push up, careful to allow you time to adjust before sinking deeper*

<b>Karl:</b> *continues to hum, tongue flickering over and around you with each thrust, savoring the slow glide of your cock down my throat, feeling myself grow wetter with each moan from you*

<b>Harry:</b> *another low growl, fingers tightening in your hair as i come, thrusting deep one last time, shuddering at the force of my orgasm*

<b>Karl:</b> *pushing the bond wide open as the first drop hits the back of my throat, swallowing, more than a little surprised that you taste different now, smiling to myself at the tiny shudders rippling through you as I continue to move, tongue coaxing you back to full hardness*

<b>Harry:</b> *tugging you up, parting your lips with my tongue, hands sliding along your back to the curve of your hips, cock rubbing between your cheeks*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles as I finally break the kiss, pushing up against your chest, wiggling just a little against you*  What's that you're always telling me, Sin...oh yeah...patience, love.  *wicked smile as I reach for the condom*

<b>Harry:</b> I've been patient.  *shifting to allow you easier access as you slide the condom over me, then grasping your hips & poising you over my cock*  

<b>Karl:</b> *hands curling over your wrists as I shake my head*  No.  Let me.

<b>Harry:</b> *softly*  Alright.

<b>Karl:</b> *bright smile, leaning down to kiss you softly before I sit up and position myself, hands braced on your chest, eyes locked with yours as I slowly impale myself on your cock, lips parting at the exquisite feel of you gliding inside me*

<b>Harry:</b> *holding your hips, but only to guide, biting my lower lip to keep from thrusting up into your slick heat, giving you control*

<b>Karl:</b> Love you...  *whispers, eyes never leaving yours as I start to move, hips rolling against you as my hands curl against your chest*

<b>Harry:</b> Love you... *forcing myself to keep my eyes open so i can watch you, watch us together, the slide of my cock inside you, the flush of your cheeks, and i slide my hands up to cup your breasts*

<b>Karl:</b> *arching forward, pushing my breasts into your hands as my head falls back, hair brushing the top of my hips as I keep moving*

<b>Harry:</b> So beautiful... *reverently, rolling your nipples between my fingers*

<b>Karl:</b> *one hand covers yours, sapphire sparkling in the light as I move*  Need to...do something...  *flash of blue in my eyes and the ring grows a little smaller to perfectly fit my finger*  There...  *smiling at you, licking my lips, gasping softly as your hands move over my breasts*

<b>Harry:</b> Perfect.  *pulling you down, nuzzling one nipple, then the other, hips flexing against yours*

<b>Karl:</b> Sin...  *biting my lip, moaning when your tongue curls around a taut nipple, fingernails scraping your chest*  Fuck me....

<b>Harry:</b> *Soft smile before rolling you over & trapping you under me*  Hold tight, love.... *not waiting for a reply as i start to slam into you, hips pistoning, pushing you into the mattress*

<b>Karl:</b> *crying out softly, this body definitely NOT used to this side of you, and I have to struggle to catch my breath as it moves with you, nails digging into the muscles of your back, legs locking around your waist*

<b>Harry:</b> *rough, messy thrusts, tackling your mouth, pushing so deep inside you i know i'll never be free, already so close i can practically taste my release*

<b>Karl:</b> *you're hitting exactly the right spot, and it's too much...way too much...and I shatter with a cry, muscles tightening around you*

<b>Harry:</b> *cock flooded with wet and incredible heat and that's all it takes for me to come, kissing you deeply to swallow my moans at how incredibly perfect this feels*

<b>Karl:</b> *whimpering softly as the bond is flooded with too many emotions to count, nuzzling your neck when you collapse on top of me*

<b>Harry:</b> Love you... *murmurs, too drained to do or say anything else at the moment*

<b>Karl:</b> Love you.  *kisses your jaw, shifting a little, feeling a twinge*  Ow...  *tries to take a deep breath...hmm...now this is interesting....dainty and delicate and fragile is nice and all but...*  Sin...getoffame...you're squashing me.

<b>Harry:</b> Bloody women... *teasing groan, rolling to your side*

<b>Karl:</b> M'a lot littler'n you.  *dark look, thumping your chest*  'Sides, you happen to like this particular bloody woman.

<b>Harry:</b> I've always loved you as a woman.  *smiling*  But I must admit this body is... exceptional.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh?  *curious, looking down at myself*  How so?

<b>Harry:</b> *tapping your nose*  Not feeding the ego, love.  You're still a man, you know fully well what you're doing to me in this form.

<b>Karl:</b> *rolling my eyes*  Wasn't being egotistical.

<b>Harry:</b> Mmhmm.  *unconvinced*

<b>Karl:</b> I wasn't.  *quietly, curling against you*  You said THIS body was exceptional...was just wondering why it was so different than the others.

<b>Harry:</b> As you said.  Designed for me.  *tucking your head under my chin*  

<b>Karl:</b> I really think it was.  *softly, hand resting on your chest*  Doesn't make sense otherwise.

<b>Harry:</b> You seem to be taking this awfully well now, epaei.

<b>Karl:</b> *small shrug*  Well, I figure I can either get completely hysterical about it, or I can accept it.  Not like I have much choice.

<b>Harry:</b> There's always a choice.  *kissing your forehead*  

<b>Karl:</b> The bond wanted me in this body.  *quietly, tucking my hair behind my ear*  I've learned not to fight it when it wants something.

<b>Harry:</b> Still wish I knew how and why it did this.  I've never heard of someone shifting through a bond.

<b>Karl:</b> Marisol'd never heard of anyone shifting at all.  *very quietly, peeking up at you as I nibble at one nail*  Um, Harry...would now be a bad time to tell you that, um, thebonddidalltheshifting?

<b>Harry:</b> What??

<b>Karl:</b> *wincing a little at your reaction, voice small when I answer*  The bond did it all.  I just relaxed and let it.

<b>Harry:</b> You...the bond...Christ.  *blinks*

<b>Karl:</b> M'sorry.  *whispers*

<b>Harry:</b> Not your fault.  *kissing your hair*  Stop apologizing.

<b>Karl:</b> I didn't know what to do.  *head down, still very quiet*  And you said I should do what felt right.  So I did.

<b>Harry:</b> You did the right thing, love.  *tilting your chin up*  I just wish I knew *why* it was doing this.

<b>Karl:</b> Well, you always said I was the perfect version of me.  *weak smile*

<b>Harry:</b> So I did.  *muses*

<b>Karl:</b> *quiet for a moment, then nudges your arm*  You're thinking again.  Share.

<b>Harry:</b> Just that... *gathering my thoughts*  I've mated with you as both male and female... but I only /bonded/ with you as a male.

<b>Karl:</b> *props up on one elbow to look at you*  So...you have to bond with me like this?

<b>Harry:</b> It's the best guess I can come up with.  *shrugs*

<b>Karl:</b> But our bond's still here.  *confused*  You can't make a double bond, can you?

<b>Harry:</b> /Part/ of it is.  The blue.

<b>Karl:</b> So how do we anchor the orange?  *sitting up, trying to think this through*

<b>Harry:</b> *tapping the sapphire on your finger*  We bond.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  You think marriage will do it?

<b>Harry:</b> It's the way I've always bonded with you as a female.

<b>Karl:</b> If it works...what then?  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know.

<b>Karl:</b> *faint smile*  You're supposed to be my fount of knowledge here, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know everything, love.  *sheepish smile*  Sorry to disappoint.

<b>Karl:</b> Not disappointed.  *quietly*  Scared.

<b>Harry:</b> Don't be.  *quietly, cupping your cheek*  We're in this together.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *manages to smile, hand lifting, fingers curling around yours*  Guess I should look at the bright side, huh?

<b>Harry:</b> What's that?

<b>Karl:</b> Well, I got a whole new wardrobe out of it.  *smiles*  And we don't need to look for a Thracian female anymore.

<b>Harry:</b> No... I guess we don't.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, a little unsure at the look in your eyes*  Was just teasing, Sin...

<b>Harry:</b> Don't think the bond is, love...

<b>Karl:</b> *stares at you, stunned*  Don't think...what...

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly*  I don't think the bond is teasing.

<b>Karl:</b> You mean it wants me to...  *trails off, mind going blank at the implication*

<b>Harry:</b> Can't you feel it?

<b>Karl:</b> I was trying to ignore that...whatever it's doing right now.  *swallows, looking at you...yeah, I want kids, but this isn't exactly what I had in mind*

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly*  We're not ready yet, epaei.  No matter what the bond wants.

<b>Karl:</b> It can be pretty insistent.  *mumbles, pulling my knees up to my chest, arms wrapping around them*

<b>Harry:</b> So can we.  *watching you*  We're not ready.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *shaky smile, arms tight around my legs*  But god, Sin...it's what I've wanted for so long...and now I can have it, in a way that's perfect for *us*...but I can't...it's cruel.

<b>Harry:</b> *tugging you back into my arms*  We'll get there, love.  Sooner than you think.

<b>Karl:</b> *curling in your arms, telling myself I'm not going to cry, I'm not, this is a stupid thing to cry over, I'm not going to cry*

<b>Harry:</b> *softy, holding you close*  'Msorry.  I know it's not what you want to hear.

<b>Karl:</b> *just nods, holding on to you, only now realizing how easy it is for women to cry over something so stupid*

<lj-cut text=""After Elana, Karl's in for the shock of his life..."">
<b>Harry:</b> *dropping in the chair next to you, pressing a bottle of water into your hand as i watch the tide start to come in across white sand*  nice view.  *softly*

<b>Karl:</b> It is.  *flashes you a smile as I uncap the bottle and take a long swallow*  Thanks.

<b>Harry:</b> Welcome.  *watching the tide for a few more minutes*  You haven't asked why yet.  *Quietly, still watching the ocean*

<b>Karl:</b> Figured you'd tell me when you were ready.  *sidelong look*  You ready?

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.  You?

<b>Karl:</b> Sure.  *half smile, shifting to look directly at you*

<b>Harry:</b> Tell me why you said yes.

<b>Karl:</b> *cocks my head as I consider that, watching you*  Cause I wanted her.

<b>Harry:</b> You've been tempted by many women and men, epaei.  Why /her/?

<b>Karl:</b> Because she was looking to be claimed.

<b>Harry:</b> *soft smile*  There's your answer, love.  

<b>Karl:</b> *sharp look*  My answer?

<b>Harry:</b> To why I did it.

<b>Karl:</b> You were looking for someone to claim?

<b>Harry:</b> No.  *tapping the back of your hand*  I was looking for someone *you* could claim.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, startled*  Um...

<b>Harry:</b> Yes?

<b>Karl:</b> I'm not sure I understand.  *quietly*

<b>Harry:</b> *just as quietly*  Your familiar is very dominant, epaei.  Very dominant.

<b>Karl:</b> *slow blink*  My...you mean the panther.

<b>Harry:</b> Yes.

<b>Karl:</b> *frowns, trying to figure this out*  You wanted the panther to claim her?

<b>Harry:</b> The panther was going to claim someone.  I just gave it an outlet.

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes narrow a bit*  You didn't want it to claim you.

<b>Harry:</b> *calmly gazing back at you*  I'm not submissive enough for it.

<b>Karl:</b> Still not sure I understand.  *quietly*  Why did you think...

<b>Harry:</b> You couldn't feel the call in your blood?  The need ripping at you, to mark and claim your territory?

<b>Karl:</b> I...I don't know.  *slowly, looking up at you*  Is that what it was?

<b>Harry:</b> You tell me, love.  He's your panther, not mine.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know...  *softly*  Never felt like that before.  Just...I looked up and saw her watching us, and...I had to have her.

<b>Harry:</b> I know.  *slow nod*  I felt it with you.  Which is why I suggested it.

<b>Karl:</b> And you...you're okay with that?  *quietly, watching you*

<b>Harry:</b> It was just one night.

<b>Karl:</b> What if it happens again?  *curls up in the chair*

<b>Harry:</b> What if it does?

<b>Karl:</b> What do we do then?

<b>Harry:</b> Well, I tell you what we're not doing.  *small smile*  We're not finding you a pet.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  Pet?

<b>Harry:</b> A submissive for your panther.

<b>Karl:</b> *startled*  You think I want a pet?

<b>Harry:</b> I think *part* of you wants a pet.

<b>Karl:</b> *considers that, chewing the side of my thumb*  The panther part.  But I don't...what if it DOES happen again?  Hell, I don't even know what caused it this time.

<b>Harry:</b> You let him out near a crowd of people.  *slight shrug*  It's an animal, love.  It's going to hunt if it thinks it can.

<b>Karl:</b> I...was hunting you.  *quietly*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, I know.  *softly*  

<b>Karl:</b> *rubs forehead*  S'making my head hurt, Sin.  You let me have her cause the panther wanted her, but the panther was hunting you.

<b>Harry:</b> Until he found something...some*one*...weaker.  More easily attainable.  *placing my hand over yours*  Think about what you know of how cats hunt, love.

<b>Karl:</b> *looks at you*  Makes sense, I suppose.  But still...what if he does it again?  Do we just find me some random, faceless female to fuck?

<b>Harry:</b> Dunno.  *shrugs*  This is new to me, too.  But I'm not going to deny that having her was a lot of fun.

<b>Karl:</b> *scratches my chin and sighs*  Yeah, I kinda noticed that you really enjoyed it.  *crooked smile*

<b>Harry:</b> I like pussy.  *simply*  But I'm not willing to make a habit of this.

<b>Karl:</b> No, I don't want to share you on a regular basis with a woman.  *faint smile, looking back out at the water*  I know you too well.

<b>Harry:</b> That you do.  

<b>Karl:</b> Not real eager to get shoved aside just because I had the misfortune to be born with a dick.

<b>Harry:</b> *soft sigh*  I can't help what I prefer anymore than you can.  I shouldn't have to apologize for it.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm not asking you to.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> Sounded like it.

<b>Karl:</b> *rubbing my eyes*  I wasn't.  Just...

<b>Harry:</b> I prefer women, yes.  *squeezing your fingers*  But I'm bonded to you.

<b>Karl:</b> No, I know you do.  *rueful smile, lacing our fingers together*  I've always known.

<b>Harry:</b> So, to answer your question, I don't know.

<b>Karl:</b> *quick glance at you*  Sin...you ever wonder what it'd be like?

<b>Harry:</b> What what would be like?  *puzzled*

<b>Karl:</b> *tilts my head, turning it just enough to fully look at you*  Fucking me as a woman.

<b>Harry:</b> *slow blink*  Um, no.  Can't say that I have.

<b>Karl:</b> I have.  *very softly*

<b>Harry:</b> Have you?  *thoughtful expression*

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, looking back out at the water, feet up in the chair so my chin rests on my knees*

<b>Harry:</b> Why?

<b>Karl:</b> *small shrug*  Dunno really.  Just have.  First I thought it was having all the memories in my head.  Then...dunno.  Realized it was coming from somewhere else, I guess.

<b>Harry:</b> Somewhere else?  *confused all over again*

<b>Karl:</b> The curiousity.  It's not because of the memories.  I guess...maybe it's just me being odd or something.

<b>Harry:</b> Okay.  *not really understanding at all*

<b>Karl:</b> *sighs*  I can't really explain it.  I just...I've wondered about it sometimes.  What it'd be like to have soft curves and feel fragile and make love to you as a woman.  *shrugs, looking down at my bare toes*

<b>Harry:</b> And you don't think it's the memories of the others?  *quietly, fingers flexing over yours*

<b>Karl:</b> *shaking my head*  It feels different.

<b>Harry:</b> Weird.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft laugh*  Tell me about it.

<b>Harry:</b> Well, I... *trailing off*  I have no idea what to say, actually.

<b>Karl:</b> *sighs and smiles*  Didn't think you would.

<b>Harry:</b> *small smile*  Good thing.  

<b>Karl:</b> *looks down at my toes again, no clue what to say now* So...  *attempting a bright smile*  What do we talk about now that I've managed to make myself look a complete freak?

<b>Harry:</b> *soft chuckle*  You're not a freak.  Just...surprised me.  Makes me wonder why I've never thought of having you take me as a woman.  Maybe I'm the freak, not you.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  Why would I do that?  You've never been a woman.

<b>Harry:</b> Then I should be curious, shouldn't I?

<b>Karl:</b> Well...I dunno.  *brow furrows*  I mean...I've never thought about what it would be like if you were a woman.

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know that I'd like it too much.  *glances down*  Although the clitoris thing might be nice.

<b>Karl:</b> *surprised laugh*  Yeah, probably would.  *pauses, chewing my lip, thinking I should probably just shut up now*  I think I might like it...once I got used to it.

<b>Harry:</b> What, being a woman?  *glances at you again*  Karl, are we still talking fantasy here?  Or is there something you're not telling me?

<b>Karl:</b> *glances over*  What?

<b>Harry:</b> You seem very... I dunno.  But the energy coming from you is different.

<b>Karl:</b> *curious look*  It is?  How so?

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know.  *frowns*  Just is.

<b>Karl:</b> *sinks into my bond for a second, trying to see if I can pick up on whatever it is that you are*  *finally shakes my head*  What's it feel like?

<b>Harry:</b> Sunset.  Bout the best way I can describe it.

<b>Karl:</b> Sunset?  *blinks, examing the bond again*

<b>Harry:</b> Heat that doesn't burn.  I'm not very good at this.

<b>Karl:</b> *catches your hand, looking directly at you*  Try, Harry...please.

<b>Harry:</b> *nods, then closing my eyes, leading you to the weird, muted colors in our bond*  There.

<b>Karl:</b> *studies it, only mildly surprised for some odd reason*  New colors in there...why...

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know. I just know it feels different here.

<b>Karl:</b> *opens my eyes to look at you, and they're glowing softly*  When'd it start?

<b>Harry:</b> Not sure.  *brushing your hair back, looking into eyes glowing a dull orange*  Just noticed it a few days ago.

<b>Karl:</b> Few days...  *trying to remember everything that's happened as the bond continues to swirl slowly*

<b>Harry:</b> And you can't remember why it would be different?

<b>Karl:</b> No...  *slowly, still trying to remember the last few days, pulling away from the bond a little as it starts to pulse softly*

<b>Harry:</b> Did you do that?  *frowns, backing from the bond*

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, eyes still glowing*  I didn't do anything, Harry.

<b>Harry:</b> Karl... *snapping the bond closed, not remotely liking the way your eyes have now gone a brighter orange*

<b>Karl:</b> *blinking rapidly as the world seems to tilt for a split second*  What..?

<b>Harry:</b> What just happened there?  *softly, watching you*

<b>Karl:</b> *shakes my head, eyes fading back down again but still holding a faint glow*  You closed the bond...why?

<b>Harry:</b> It didn't feel right.  *frowning again*

<b>Karl:</b> What happened to it?  *reaching for the bond instinctively, confused*

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know.  *clutching your hand, hating this weird silence in my head*  But it was twisting the bond.

<b>Karl:</b> Twisting it...  *almost a whisper*  Harry...you said it feels like a sunset...still does, right?

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah. 

<b>Karl:</b> *reaches for the bond again, coming up against a wall and knowing it's you*  Not affecting you.

<b>Harry:</b> No, I closed it.  *looking at you*  What is it?

<b>Karl:</b> Whatever it is...  *looks up at you, eyes still glowing*  Coming from me, Sin.  Your bond doesn't feel any different.

<b>Harry:</b> I know.  *softly*  And it's still there.  Your eyes are... fuck, epaei.  I have no idea what's going on.

<b>Karl:</b> My eyes are what?  *forcing back the frantic note that tries to creep into my voice, still reaching for our bond*

<b>Harry:</b> Orange.

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes go wide*  Orange?  No.  *shakes head*  They glow blue.

<b>Harry:</b> They're glowing orange right now.  *gesturing towards the house*  See for yourself.

<b>Karl:</b> *dives into my bond, reaching hard for the one we share, trying to figure out what the fuck is going on*

<b>Harry:</b> And you weren't aware anything had felt differently?  *still watching you, still keeping our bond closed*

<b>Karl:</b> No.  *soft growl, still pushing hard at our bond, frustrated now*  Was just concentrating on being here with you.

<b>Harry:</b> Then I have no idea.  *opening our bond slightly*  Because /this/ isn't normal.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft sigh of relief when I can feel our bond again*  Harry...I didn't do anything.  I swear.

<b>Harry:</b> I'm not saying you did.  *quietly, curling around you through the bond*  Just saying this doesn't feel right.

<b>Karl:</b> And it started a few days ago?  *afraid to look at the sliding glass doors behind us, not really wanting to see if my eyes are still glowing or not*

<b>Harry:</b> Very sporadically.  I didn't think anything of it.

<b>Karl:</b> You did just now.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> It wasn't like this until just now.

<b>Karl:</b> Like what?

<b>Harry:</b> Pulsing like this.

<b>Karl:</b> *absently chewing the side of my thumb, eyes glowing a very dull orange*  When'd it start that?

<b>Harry:</b> A few minutes ago.  *very concerned, but trying to be calm*

<b>Karl:</b> A few...  *almost like something goes 'click' inside me*  Harry...  *very quietly, almost not daring to breathe*  When it first started...WHEN was it?

<b>Harry:</b> Um... *thinking* ...when we were first discussing your odd little fantasy, why?

<b>Karl:</b> No.  *shaking my head*  When you first noticed it.

<b>Harry:</b> We were here...um...a few days ago.

<b>Karl:</b> Day or night, Sin?  And what day?  *trying hard to remember but all I can come up with a black hole from several nights back*

<b>Harry:</b> Day.  *thinks*  Four days ago.  We were having lunch.  Um... that little bistro we've been going to before the beach.

<b>Karl:</b> I had a dream the night before that.  *slowly, looking up at you*  I can't remember it.

<b>Harry:</b> And you think it might be related somehow?

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know.  *quietly, looking down again*  Just...I usually remember my dreams, especially the vivid ones.  And this one was REALLY vivid...woke up in a sweat from it.  But...nothing.  Can't remember a single thing.

<b>Harry:</b> You think any of the others might have better luck?  *desperate for any answers, cause you're still pulsing orange*

<b>Karl:</b> They're all being really quiet.  *softly, staring at the tide rolling in*  This is still new to them, being able to talk to someone.

<b>Harry:</b> Okay.

<b>Karl:</b> *quick glance*  It got worse when I started talking about...  *gestures*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, being a woman.

<b>Karl:</b> It was just a fantasy.  *quietly, almost like I'm speaking to myself*  Granted, a really detailed one sometimes, but still...

<b>Harry:</b> Wait... *giving you a puzzled look*  Did you say really detailed?

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, then looks at you, feeling a faint flush stain my cheeks*  Um...yeah.  Sometimes.

<b>Harry:</b> Like the dream you can't remember?  *quietly, cupping your cheek, thumb brushing across heated skin*

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, eyes locked with yours*  Only I can remember the fantasies.

<b>Harry:</b> How often do you have them? On average.

<b>Karl:</b> *small shrug*  Once, maybe twice a week.  They just kinda happen.  The really detailed ones...maybe every fourth time.

<b>Harry:</b> Have you had one since this dream you can't remember?

<b>Karl:</b> *thinks carefully*  Um... *small voice*  This morning in the shower...after we got back here.

<b>Harry:</b> *looking closely at you*  How vivid was it?

<b>Karl:</b> Very.  *mumbles, flushing, looking down at my toes*

<b>Harry:</b> Karl... *waiting until you look up*  It might be related.  Maybe.

<b>Karl:</b> Kinda a scary thought, Sin.  *lopsided smile*  Cause for a few seconds this morning...  *small shrug, eyes flashing bright for a split second before dulling down again*

<b>Harry:</b> What?

<b>Karl:</b> *very quietly*  Almost believed that bits of me weren't...there anymore.

<b>Harry:</b> *blinks*  Come again?

<b>Karl:</b> *another shrug*  Like something was missing.  Or something.  Then I got shampoo in my eyes and snapped out of it.

<b>Harry:</b> Like what was missing?  *no real idea why i'm harping on this...it just /feels/ important*

<b>Karl:</b> *simply raises an eyebrow, giving you a level look*  Well seeing as how I was fantasizing about being a woman...

<b>Harry:</b> And it felt like...it *was* gone?

<b>Karl:</b> Told you they were vivid.  *mumbles, looking down*

<b>Harry:</b> Karl... *slowly, very slowly, drawing out each word, a horrible, weird suspicion starting to form in my head*  ...you ever felt like that *before* we got here?

<b>Karl:</b> *thinks back, trying to remember each time*  I don't...think so.

<b>Harry:</b> What I thought.  *quietly*  Do you know what the opposite of blue is?

<b>Karl:</b> Orange.  *immediately, not thinking, just remembering the few art classes I've had...then stopping, eyes going round as I stare at you*  Sin...what...

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know.  *gripping your hand tightly*  But...yeah...could be.

<b>Karl:</b> Could be?  *can't quite disguise the frantic note in my voice this time*  Could be what??

<b>Harry:</b> That you could...um...y'know.  /Shift/.

<b>Karl:</b> *violent start, mouth dropping open*  Shift...you mean...

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.

<b>Karl:</b> *stares, pretty sure my brain has shut down*  Into a...woman?  *barely above a whisper*

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.  *still gripping your hand tightly*  I don't know.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks rapidly, more than a little afraid to take another look at my bond...and really sure I don't want to look in a mirror right now, just in case*  How...how do we know?

<b>Harry:</b> I have no idea.

<b>Karl:</b> Should I try...  *trailing off, swallowing hard when the bond gives a hard pulse*  Um....

<b>Harry:</b> No.  *a lot more sharply than i intended*  Karl... love, we don't know what's going on here.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *deep breath, fingers convulsing in yours*  And it's scaring me more'n a little, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> That makes two of us.  *tugging you out of your chair and into my lap*

<b>Karl:</b> *arms around you, face pressed against your shoulder as I curl in your lap*  Wants something.  *mumbles*

<b>Harry:</b> Hmm?  *stroking your back, nuzzling your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> Feels like it wants something...like it's waiting...  *whispers, shivering a little in the warm evening breeze*

<b>Harry:</b> Well, it can keep waiting.  *pulling you even closer*  Cause it's not getting you.

<b>Karl:</b> What if I can't stop it?  *quietly, lifting my head to look at you*  Don't even know what started it.

<b>Harry:</b> We'll figure it out together, alright?

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, curling against you again*  *softly*  It's making me itch.

<b>Harry:</b> What is?  *stroking a hand over your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> This.  *waves my hand*  Whatever it is.  It's...I dunno, Sin.  Insistent.  Impatient.  VERY impatient.

<b>Harry:</b> For what?

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know.  *soft sigh, slumping against your chest*  It wants something.  And it feels like...like it wants it really badly...and really soon.  But I don't know what.

<b>Harry:</b> You think it might *want* you to shift?  *wishing i had the first fucking clue about what's going on, because this, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me*

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know.  *whispers, trying to curl into a little ball*  It just...it keeps getting stronger...like a storm building kinda.

<b>Harry:</b> *rubbing my hands along your back, trying to soothe you*  I don't know what to tell you, epaei.  I really don't.  I'm just as clueless as you.

<b>Karl:</b> Harry...  *looking up at you*  What if it DOES want me to shift?  Or to try?

<b>Harry:</b> Guess I'll have to make sure I get you back.  *smoothing your hair back, looking at you*  I'm not losing you.

<b>Karl:</b> *looking at you for several minutes, wishing I could feel more of the bond*  Why...why would whatever this is want me to shift?  I don't even know if I can!

<b>Harry:</b> I don't know.  I'm sorry.

<b>Karl:</b> *just nods, looking down, that simple admission terrifying me more than whatever this is ever could...when i finally look back up, my eyes are glowing again*  Harry...do you think I should...

<b>Harry:</b> *brushing your hair back again*  I think you should do whatever you feel you need to do.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't know what I need to do.  *managing a small, very shaky smile*  I don't know if I can or if I should...and if I do and actually manage it, will I be able to change back or will I be stuck like that for days like I was with the panther and --  *going silent when your finger covers my lips*

<b>Harry:</b> You're thinking too much.  *opening our bond fully, wrapping mine tightly over it, anchoring it close*  Just do it.  *kissing your forehead*

<b>Karl:</b> You really think I should?  *chewing my lower lip, feeling whatever this is start to pulse strongly again, almost surging*

<b>Harry:</b> Karl...

<b>Karl:</b> Okay.  *softly, knowing that tone of voice*  You think now would be a good time...

<b>Harry:</b> Yes.  *quietly, still anchoring my bond firmly to ours, feeling the pulse and throb, the impatience in yours*

<b>Karl:</b> You'll help me find my way back if....  *can't finish, don't even want to think about that*

<b>Harry:</b> Not gonna lose you.

<b>Karl:</b> Well, then...here goes...I guess.  *taking a deep breath, sliding off your lap to stand in front of you -- just in case -- feeling my bond snap onto yours for anchoring, smiling a little because I don't even have to think about that anymore*

<b>Harry:</b> *pulling you between my legs, gripping your hands tightly, trying for a reassuring smile*

<b>Karl:</b> Don't let go.  *surprised I can manage to smile as I finally drop into the bond, feeling it surge almost in triumph...and I can sense the orange now, swirling through the blue, seeming almost as if it has a very definite purpose...so I go with that, letting the energy dictate whatever's happening as I close my eyes*

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly watching you, sensing the shift starting in the bond, orange almost swallowing blue, and i lock onto the blue, keeping it safe*

<b>Karl:</b> *brow furrowed as I force myself not to fight it because now I've got the idea that it definitely knows exactly what it wants...can feel something start...almost like a shift, but not...the panther is much stronger, more liquid and flowing...this is...odd...very odd*

<b>Harry:</b> *not so much a shift as a glide...like watching a sculpture come to life...only this is living, breathing tissue and muscle and skin.  it's both terrifying and exhilarating at once & i continue to watch his slow shift*

<b>Karl:</b> *my hands curl into loose fists at my sides, and my head falls back, eyes still closed...odd...I can feel soft hair brushing low on my back...didn't realize it had gotten that long...orange is so fucking bright now, almost overwhelming the blue in spots, pulsing, surging, doing SOMETHING*

<b>Harry:</b> *not daring to even blink as i watch in reverent awe*  christ... *glancing at you...only it's not.  but it is.  you -- with curves and hair -- and very much so not my karl*

<b>Karl:</b> *taking deep breaths, a trifle unsteady on my feet as I lift my head and open my eyes to look at you, feeling the orange start to subside to a low murmur, much like the blue*

<b>Harry:</b> *looking down at our laced fingers -- the elegant curves, fragile bones -- trying to regain my breath, wondering still just what in the hell is going on*

<b>Karl:</b> *keeping my eyes on your face, too afraid to look anywhere else, too afraid even to speak*

<b>Harry:</b> You're... *clearing my throat* ...Christ, Karl...you...

<b>Karl:</b> I'm what...  *stopping, stunned at the voice I hear...that's sure as hell NOT my voice*

<b>Harry:</b> ...that.  *lamely, gaze traveling from the soft fall of curly dark hair down to your toes*  

<b>Karl:</b> *clearing my throat, trying again, stopping immediately when the voice that isn't mine comes out of my mouth...then I look down...*

<b>Harry:</b> you look nice.  *very lamely, shock pulsing through my every pore.  this isn't supposed to be possible.*

<b>Karl:</b> *I watch as my hand -- least I THINK it's my hand -- lifts, slender, almost delicate fingers plucking at my t-shirt -- which is stretched tight in places it shouldn't be stretched tight in...a hesitant poke, and...um...yeah, they're real...oh fuck...oh fuck...ohgodohjesusohfuckohfuck*

<b>Harry:</b> Karl...Karl!  *squeezing painfully on soft hands*  Look at me.  Breathe.

<b>Karl:</b> *staring at you with wide eyes, knowing that I'm pretty close to hyperventilating, but I can't help it...there are all these curves where there shouldn't be curves and I'm definitely a little shorter and my clothes don't feel right*

<b>Harry:</b> Sit.  *pulling you into my lap, a little surprised at how easily you fit, how well you conform to my body*  It's alright, okay?  I've got you anchored.  You're still here.  *pouring every ounce of love and support into the bond, stroking long hair*

<b>Karl:</b> *absently tugging up the waistband of my jeans when they slip, trembling in your arms*  This isn't my body, Sin...  *and oh jesus I SOUND like a girl!*

<b>Harry:</b> I can see that.  *fighting the small smile*  But apparently something inside you thinks that it is.

<b>Karl:</b> I don't care what it thinks, this...  *stopping when I feel something in the bond, then the flat of my hand connects with your chest*  Stop laughing, damn it!

<b>Harry:</b> I'm sorry.  *god, you're cute like this, all full of female indignation.  it's been a long time since i've dealt with you as a woman*  

<b>Karl:</b> No, you're not!  *crossing my arms over...under...well, this is certainly awkward as hell*

<b>Harry:</b> You have any idea how much you sounded like Diana just then?  *finally giving up & grinning.  hey, it's better than fretting to death.  and you really are cute like this*

<b>Karl:</b> *flashing you a dark look from beneath hair that seems determined to fall in my face*  You're not helping.

<b>Harry:</b> What would you like from me, epaei?  *schooling my features into the proper serious expression...after 11 lifetimes dealing with you as a woman, i've got it down to a science*  Whatever you need, we'll work it out.

<b>Karl:</b> *starts to take a deep breath, then stops when your eyes drop to my...yeah...you're getting an elbow in the ribs for that one*  Eyes up here, Sin.  As for what I need...  *shifts a bit, tugging at the jeans again*  Some clothes that fit would be nice.

<b>Harry:</b> Sorry.  *even though i'm not.  they are...very nice.*  Well, I guess we could go inside...maybe find something of yours that might fit until we can go shopping.

<b>Karl:</b> Something of mine that might fit.  *gives a very unladylike snort as I slide from your lap and stand...and immediately grab for the jeans when they slip*  In case you hadn't noticed, oh observant one, my waist is considerable smaller than it was ten minutes ago.  And let's not forget about THESE!  *points*

<b>Harry:</b> Believe me, love, I haven't forgotten about them.  *as a certain part of my anatomy is /very/ happy to tell me*  

<b>Karl:</b> *glares at you, then turns to go into the room...and stops dead when I see myself reflected in the glass...oh jesus...I have...and...the jeans slip from numb fingers as I just stand there and stare*

<b>Harry:</b> *coming up behind you, framing gently flared hips in my hands*  It's alright.  *soft whisper in your ear, gazing at you through the reflection.

<b>Karl:</b> Jesus, Sin...  *still staring, taking in everything from much longer softly curled hair to full breasts, narrow waist, curved hips*  I'm...really hot...

<b>Harry:</b> *low, rich chuckle, sliding my hands along silky smooth skin*  Yeah.  You are.

<b>Karl:</b> *shivering, crossing my arms over my chest self-consciously because, yeah, a bra did NOT suddenly miraculously appear*  I, um....

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah?  *fuck, your skin is so soft, and i take my time gliding my hands up your stomach to cup full breasts, still watching you in the mirror*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes partially closed, head falling back against your shoulder, licking my lips...had NO idea that being touched there could feel this incredible*  Um...these clothes...

<b>Harry:</b> You're right...they don't fit.  *thumbs brushing across your nipples, watching as your lips part and delicate skin flushes*  Perhaps you'd be more comfortable out of them.  *nuzzling the soft skin behind your ear*

<b>Karl:</b> *oh fuck...those are a hell of a lot more sensitive in this body...all I can do is watch in the glass as one arm lifts over my head, curls back to wrap around your neck as my head falls to the side, hair slipping forward to cover one of your hands*

<b>Harry:</b> *one by one unsnapping the buttons of your shift, parting the sides to reveal cream-colored skin, reverently running the tips of my fingers along the soft curve of your stomach and waist before cupping your breasts again, noting with a sort of primal satisfaction that they fill my hands perfectly*

<b>Karl:</b> *my back arches, and I bite my lip...your hands on my bare skin are warm, and I can practically feel the electricity humming between us as my eyes meet yours in the reflection*

<b>Harry:</b> Is this what you thought about?  *once again, my thumbs rub over rose-colored nipples, a slow drag back & forth, as my lips skim over the slope of your shoulder*

<b>Karl:</b> *shivering as I gasp softly, nodding, unable to form words, too wrapped up in the new sensations coursing through me and the heaviness in my lower abdomen that's not like anything I've ever felt before*

<b>Harry:</b> So pretty... *teasing your nipples between my thumbs & forefingers, running my teeth up your neck to your earlobe*

<b>Karl:</b> Harry...  *softly moaning your name, back arching again, nipples tight peaks under your fingers*

<b>Harry:</b> Hmmm?  *blowing cool air across your neck*

<b>Karl:</b> *squirming, letting out a soft giggle -- GIGGLE?!? -- at the sensation, then gasping again as my hips accidentally brush against yours*

<b>Harry:</b> Like that?  *slowly grinding my hips against yours, cock insistently pushing against my jeans as i lick along your neck, overwhelmed by how perfect you feel, how right this feels*

<b>Karl:</b> *opening my eyes to meet yours in the reflection again, shivering at the hot look in your eyes, at the feel of your hands on my body*  *softly*  You want this body.

<b>Harry:</b> I won't do anything you don't want.  *quietly, hiding nothing through the bond*

<b>Karl:</b> Yes or no, Sin.  *smiling, a little disconcerted at how easily the seductive look comes in this body, more than a little surprised that this actually feels right*

<b>Harry:</b> *slowly licking my lips, gaze traversing your body -- full, soft breasts, the gentle curve of hips, the soft thatch of curls between shapely legs...*  Yes.  *growling whisper*

<b>Karl:</b> *smiling, stepping away from you, out of jeans that ceased doing me any good, oh, about ten minutes ago, shrugging out of my shirt as I turn to face you...then I smile again, shaking my hair back so it tumbles around my shoulders in soft waves, sliding my hands along my sides*  Then take it...

<b>Harry:</b> *eyes narrowing as i step forward, shrugging out of my clothing until i'm before you, naked, hard, wanting nothing more than to bury myself in the heat and scent of you*  Yes.  *growling the word again before tugging you into my arms and finally kissing petal-soft lips, plundering the sweet recesses of your mouth with my tongue, and lifting you up, urging your legs around my waist*

<b>Karl:</b> *my legs lock high around your waist as my arms wrap around your neck, tilting my head to give you full access to my mouth, breasts crushed against your chest, ass securely cradled in strong hands...and fuck if this isn't a hell of a lot more than I imagined it would be*

<b>Harry:</b> *it takes every shred of control i have not to ease into you right now & fuck you against the nearest wall... but you deserve more for your first time in this body.  without breaking the kiss, i walk into the bedroom, keeping a firm grip on you to hold you in place*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue slides over yours, hands tangling deep in your hair, and I can feel you pressing against me with each step...it's an odd feeling, but definitely NOT a bad one at all*

<b>Harry:</b> *twisting as we fall onto the bed so you land on top of me, threading my fingers in your hair, grinding up against you as my mouth slants over yours again*

<b>Karl:</b> *softly moaning into your mouth as I shift, rubbing against you -- and there should be something there...well, there is, but not at all what I'm used to -- and there's almost a physical ache between my thighs*

<b>Harry:</b> *tugging you up along my body until i can nuzzle your breasts, flicking my tongue over one nipple, then the other, keeping my eyes on you, watching to see how you'll react to this new sensation*

<b>Karl:</b> Jesus...  *jerking hard, fingernails -- where did those come from? -- digging into your shoulders as sparks shoot through me at the wet glide of your tongue over puckered skin*

<b>Harry:</b> *smiling, taking one nipple between my lips, sucking hard as my hands race along your back*

<b>Karl:</b> Unh...  *back arching, head dropping forward to curtain us in a cloud of dark hair, eyes closing...yeah, definitely a LOT more sensitive in this body...*

<b>Harry:</b> *looks like the lovely ms. elena was just batting practice for the real thing, because the feel of you moving and writhing over me as i suckle at one puckered nipple, then the other, is quite possibly the hottest thing i've ever felt.*

<b>Karl:</b> *moaning softly as your mouth continues to tease my breasts, feeling myself get wetter with each passing minute, unable to catch my breath or think as skilled fingers dance over my skin*

<b>Harry:</b> *rolling us over, pinning you to the mattress, kisslicking each inch of creamy skin as i slide down your torso*

<b>Karl:</b> *please...ohgod...not sure how much more of this I can take, never realized the female body was so sensitive, fingers digging into the mattress as I writhe beneath you, skin on fire where your lips touch*

<b>Harry:</b> *sliding my hands under your ass, lifting your hips as i settle between your thighs*  Wonder how you taste... *wicked, small smile, tongue flicking out to brush over springy, soft curls*

<b>Karl:</b> *nevermind, know exactly how much more I can take and it's not much, cause I'm pretty sure I'm going to explode sometime in the next 30 seconds and...oh godohgod...a sound suspiciously close to a squeak escapes me, and my hips buck, only to be caught firmly by your hands*

<b>Harry:</b> Relax... *murmuring, pressing my tongue between pink lips, slowly dragging my tongue up/down/back & forth acros wet, slick folds*

<b>Karl:</b> Relax??  *strangled voice, head falling back on the pillow, both hands fisting in your hair as I arch violently off the bed, crying out when your tongue circles the tiny bundle of nerves*

<b>Harry:</b> *another smile, gently sucking on your clit, spreading your thighs even further apart*

<b>Karl:</b> *ohgodohfuck...intense pleasure rockets through me, and I cry out again, surrendering completely to what you're doing, to this whole world of new sensations*

<b>Harry:</b> *sucking gently on the small nub, tongue flicking over sensitized skin, making small sounds of satisfaction as you writhe and moan beneath me.  god, i've missed this*

<b>Karl:</b> *I feel a small bit of pressure, then...ohgod..fingers...sliding inside me...while you...my toes curl in the covers, my hips press up against your mouth, and I'm pretty sure I shriek as the explosion hits me, turning the world white, almost painfully intense pleasure rolling through me in waves*

<b>Harry:</b> *slowly licking my lips as i lift my head, watching you out of dark eyes*  Christ, you taste good like this.

<b>Karl:</b> *tiny tremors wracking my muscles as I lay limp against the pillow, looking at you with dazed eyes.  then I smile and crook one finger*  Gonna share?

<b>Harry:</b> Of course.  *another tiny lick across your curls before sliding up your body, pressing my tongue against your lips, filling my hands with your breasts again, teasing your nipples with my fingers*

<b>Karl:</b> *my lips part under yours, then I can taste myself...not as sharp, more musky...and I realize it's something I could grow addicted to quickly as small hands slide up your back, exploring warm skin and muscle while my back arches, pressing my breasts further into your hands*

<b>Harry:</b> Fuck, you're so hot... *licking my way down to your breasts, suckling on a nipple, still teasing the other between my fingers*

<b>Karl:</b> *legs shifting against yours, cradling your hips, nails scraping up your spine as I move restlessly beneath you, each tug of your mouth on my breast like a direct current to my groin...then one hand works between us, nails dragging over your stomach, lower, until my fingers can curl around you*

<b>Harry:</b> *your hand is so much smaller than what i'm used to & i push into the delicate fist surrounding me, sucking hard on your other nipple*

<b>Karl:</b> *breathless groan as my entire body seems to arch, nails digging into your back while your tongue lashes my nipple...and christ, you're bigger than I remember...no...my hand's smaller now, can't cover as much, but it's definitely got it's advantages*

<b>Harry:</b> *thrusting into your fist, licking my way back up your neck, and i want you so fucking badly it actually hurts, control barely a memory.  it's taking everything i have to not sink into your heat*  love... *tiny kiss, pushing against your fingers*  we...christ...need...

<b>Karl:</b> Please, Sin...  *whispering against your lips, hand moving over your length as my other hand slips between us, nails dragging lightly over your balls, body shifting restlessly beneath you, wanting something I don't -- no, I know EXACTLY what I want, and that's you inside me*

<b>Harry:</b> can't.  *and it's quiet possibly the hardest thing i've had to do in, um, fuck, i can't quite remember.  but i pull away, sitting up, gaze raking over your glorious, nude form*  need protection.

<b>Karl:</b> *sitting up with you, hands running along your sides, leaning in to nuzzle your neck, breasts brushing your chest*  Protec...  *trailing off as my brain actually works for about two seconds*  Oh...OH!  Um....

<b>Harry:</b> hand me the phone.  *pulling you into my lap for another scorching kiss, cock pressing insistently between your cheeks*

<b>Karl:</b> *managing to pull away from the kiss long enough to fumble for the phone by the bed, almost dropping it when your hands find my breasts again*

<b>Harry:</b> *right, control... but only for the moment.  i take the phone, dialing one-handed as i continue to explore lush breasts, rapidly ordering a box of condoms & a bottle of champagne from room service, promising them double the tip if they hurry*

<b>Karl:</b> Sin...please...  *still firmly planted in your lap, head falling back and hands clutching your shoulders so my spine arches, pushing my breasts into your hands*

<b>Harry:</b> just a little longer, love... *bending my head to suckle at your breasts again, rolling the nubs between my teeth, one hand reaching between us to cup you, thumb brushing your clit*

<b>Karl:</b> *sharp gasp, hips jerking hard against your hand, nails digging into your shoulders as heat fills me...fuck, I think I could happily let you do this to me for the next few years without complaint*

<b>Harry:</b> *slow glide across wet heat, alternating between each breast, content to do just this, to listen to you moan for me*

<b>Karl:</b> *almost continuous moaning, hips rocking against your hand, another soft gasp as fingers press inside me, and each rake of teeth across taut nipples tugs at me, sending shivers through my body*

<b>Harry:</b> *lifting my head as my fingers scissor gently inside you, thumb still raking over the small nub, wanting to watch you again as you go over*

<b>Karl:</b> *shuddering, moaning your name as I drop over the edge, teeth catching my lower lip as the orgasm rockets through me*

<b>Harry:</b> so beautiful... *smiling, easing my fingers out of you just as the knock on the door echoes through the room*

<b>Karl:</b> You're biased.  *lazy smile as I slip back to sprawl on the pillows, watching you with hot eyes as you stand, tongue sliding over my lower lip at your more than obvious arousal*

<b>Harry:</b> i'll be right back.  *slow smile, grabbing a towel from the bathroom & knotting it around my waist before disappearing into the other room of the suite*

<b>Karl:</b> Mmhmm...  *taking a moment to finally look down at myself -- still amazed at the full breasts, narrow waist, long legs -- then, curiousity takes over and my hands move, fingers moving over soft skin, circling dusky nipples, drifting across my stomach...*

<b>Harry:</b> *coming back in the room a few moments later, sans towel, box in my hand and...oh hello.  isn't this hot?  i lean against the door, watching in silent reverence as you lie on the bed, exploring your body with gentle, slow touches*

<b>Karl:</b> *I know you're in the room, but I don't look up, intent on what I'm doing as one hand cups a breast, thumb brushing over the nipple, the other hand sliding down over my hip, down my leg, then gently drifting back up the inside of my thigh...and christ, this body is responsive...so sensitive to even the most delicate touch*

<b>Harry:</b> *still silently watching, enthralled with how much you're getting into this, how hot it looks to see you run your hands all over your body in languid sweeps*

<b>Karl:</b> *my hips move slowly as fingers play over slick folds, delving for a brief moment into wet heat, and I look up at you, smiling slowly*  Just gonna watch, Sin?

<b>Harry:</b> you look hot like this.  *gesturing towards the mirrored closet*  you should watch.

<b>Karl:</b> I was.  *another slow smile, fingers continuing to move, teasing both breast and clitoris, eyes straying to the mirror, then back to you*

<b>Harry:</b> tell me what you want.  *following your gaze, watching your reflection, then you*

<b>Karl:</b> You...  *softly, a little breathlessly as I lick my lips, easily sliding two fingers deep inside my body as my thumb glides over the tiny nub, so turned on by the dark look in your eyes*

<b>Harry:</b> okay.  *dropping to my knees on the bed, smiling as i settle between your thighs once more, flicking my tongue out around your fingers*

<b>Karl:</b> *very sharp gasp, hips bucking against you, head falling back*  Christ...

<b>Harry:</b> *lips closing over the nub, sucking gently, watching you out of dark eyes the entire time*

<b>Karl:</b> *my hand shifts to work around your jaw, fingers slowly pumping in and out of my body, free hand dropping to sink into your hair as my hips move and waves of sensation roll through me*

<b>Harry:</b> *licking my lips as i sit up on my haunches, opening the box*  here *holding one of the packets to you*  want you to put it on me.

<b>Karl:</b> Been a long time since I did this...  *small smile as I sit up and take the packet with an unsteady hand...glancing at it briefly, chuckling*  I see you got the thin ones.

<b>Harry:</b> Been a long time since I've needed them.  *watching you*  And I want to feel as much as possible.

<b>Karl:</b> *tearing open the foil, smiling up at you, stray lock of hair falling into my face as one hand curls around you*  Want you to feel as much as possible, too...

<b>Harry:</b> *shudders as a soft hand moves over me, kissing the side of your mouth*  love...

<b>Karl:</b> Yes?  *still smiling, hand moving slowly over you as I hold the rolled condom in the other*

<b>Harry:</b> *dark gaze pinning you in place*  i need you.  now.

<b>Karl:</b> *still smiling, free hand moving, fingers very slowly rolling the condom down over your erection, beyond aroused at the effect this body has on you*  So take me, Sin...

<b>Harry:</b> *gently parting your thighs, settling between them, nuzzling your neck as i start to push inside you...and i pause when i encounter resistance*

<b>Karl:</b> *can feel the slow slide of your cock pushing inside me, my body stretching to accomodate it, then you stop*  Harry, please...  *almost pleading, thighs tightening against your hips, hands sliding up your back, wanting you to soothe this ache deep inside*

<b>Harry:</b> easy, love.  *i debate on mentioning anything to you...but decide not to.  you'd only tense up & make it worse.  instead, i slowly press just the head of my cock inside you, rocking gently, smoothing tangled hair from your head as we kiss*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue slipsliding over yours, fingers flexing on your back, almost growling in frustration when I try to lift my hips and your hands frame them, holding them in place, convinced this teasing is just a slow torture designed to drive me insane*

<b>Harry:</b> *when i finally feel we're ready--you're ready--i distract you with a very thorough kiss, slowly pushing past the thin wall of resistance, breaching you inch by slow inch until i'm seated completely inside tight wet heat, moaning at how incredibly perfect you feel*

<b>Karl:</b> *feels a small sting that quickly fades, forgotten immediately as I focus on the absolutely incredible feeling of you inside me, filling me -- and christ, this is the most amazing thing*

<b>Harry:</b> love you, epaei... *soft murmur, brushing my lips to yours, rocking slowly inside you*

<b>Karl:</b> Love you...  *legs wrap around your waist, ankles locking against the small of your back...and god, I can see why women do that, gasping as it pulls you even deeper, lifting my head for a slow kiss as my body moves with yours*

<b>Harry:</b> *even, measured thrusts, allowing your body time to adjust before changing angle & speed, marveling at how right this is, how fucking beautiful you are, legs wrapped high around my waist, throat bare to my caress*

<b>Karl:</b> *can feel the emotions flowing through the bond as we move together, soft moans spilling from my lips as your mouth finds a nipple and starts to suckle*  Harry...  *husky whisper as my hands map your back and my legs tighten around you*

<b>Harry:</b> *doesn't bother with replying, just sucking one nipple, then the other, deep in my mouth, gentle fingers worming between us & flicking across your clit, still rocking inside you, so deep i know we'll never be free*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft cry, nails raking furrows up your back, the gentle touch undoing me, sending me spinning over the edge as you thrust inside me*

<b>Harry:</b> *watching you as you lose yourself in all these new sensations is all the aphrodisiac i need...and when you tighten around me, flooding me with wet & warmth & need, i only last one more thrust before shattering in your arms, your name the only sound i'm capable of making*

<b>Karl:</b> *pushing hair from your face, lazily nuzzling sweaty skin as my hands move lightly over your back, soothing you while you tremble in my arms*

<b>Harry:</b> *rolling to your side, careful not to crush you, nuzzling your neck & soothing you with my hands*  love you...

<b>Karl:</b> Love you.  *smiling, whispering the words against your collarbone as I snuggle into your arms, surprised at how delicate I feel right now*  That was incredible.

<b>Harry:</b> yeah, it was... *smiling, running my hands along your back, loving how incredible you feel right now* didn't hurt you, did i?

<b>Karl:</b> *shaking my head, burrowing deeper into your embrace*  No, not at all.  Bit uncomfortable for the first few seconds, but I think that was just this body getting used to you.

<b>Harry:</b> *amused chuckle*  in a manner of speaking, yeah.

<b>Karl:</b> *glances up at you*  What?

<b>Harry:</b> *kissing your forehead*  think about it.  

<b>Karl:</b> *frowns, absently reaching down to remove the condom since you don't seem to be too concerned about it*  Sin...  *trailing off as I glance down at my hands and notice a small, faint smear of blood on my fingers and the condom*

<b>Harry:</b> don't worry.  *taking the condom from you & twisting it up before dropping it into the wastebasket next to the bed*  it's normal the first time.

<b>Karl:</b> Normal...the first...  *stares at you with wide eyes, then twists to look at the sheet behind me, eyes going even wider at the very obvious red stain there*  I was...

<b>Harry:</b> this body's never been with anyone, love.  

<b>Karl:</b> You could've warned me.  *small voice, turning back to you and diving into your arms*

<b>Harry:</b> *kissing your hair, running my hands over your back in soothing circles*  you'd have been far too tense if i had, love.

<b>Karl:</b> This is so odd.  *voice muffled against your chest, arms tight around your waist, a little amazed at how perfectly this body fits against yours*

<b>Harry:</b> *softly*  not as odd as you think.

<b>Karl:</b> No?  *peeks up at you from underneath a cloud of hair*

<b>Harry:</b> no.  *christ, you're beautiful like this*  think our bond's trying to complete itself by completing /us/.  've had you as both male & female.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah?  *contemplates that in silence, poking around in my bond, pleased to see the blue still very firmly anchored to yours as the orange swirls around*

<b>Harry:</b> just need to anchor this new bond.  *and i've a pretty good idea about how to accomplish that, if it's still a thracian bond...but it seems to be*

<b>Karl:</b> Shouldn't it already be anchored?  *frowns a bit, poking at it some more*  I mean...I did what it wanted.  Female now, for the moment.  We had sex.

<b>Harry:</b> Bonding takes a bit more than just sex, love.

<b>Karl:</b> I know that.  *gives you an exasperated look as I give up on the bond for the moment*  But I did what it wanted.  Shifted.

<b>Harry:</b> Patience.  *giving you a soft kiss*  I'm pretty sure I know what it wants.

<b>Karl:</b> *trying to resist the urge to melt against you, not succeeding too well*  When do I get to know?

<b>Harry:</b> Soon as you wake up.  *smiles, kissing you again*

<b>Karl:</b> *raising an eyebrow, pretty sure I'm pouting*  But m'not sleepy.

<b>Harry:</b> *can't resist kissing your pout*  no, but i am & you will be in about a minute.  *resting back on the pilows*

<b>Karl:</b> I will?  *blinks*

<b>Harry:</b> mmhmm... *not bothering to open my eyes, just brushing my hand along your spine, settling against the pillows*

<b>Karl:</b> Harry...  *frowning just a bit when your hand gently presses against my back, pulling me down against you*

<b>Harry:</b> Rest, love.  *murmurs*  It'll be alright.

<b>Karl:</b> But m'not sleepy...  *curling against your side, head pillowed on your chest*

<b>Harry:</b> Just stay with me, then... *contented yawn, stroking your hair, already half-asleep*

<b>Karl:</b> Okay.  *murmurs, cuddling even closer, legs tangled with yours as I listen to your heartbeat under my ear, closing my eyes and smiling a little*

<lj-cut text=""The boys share..."">
<b>Harry:</b> *holding you close as you tremble and she smiles, lips shiny, licking them clean before slithering up your body to give you a deep, wet kiss*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft groan into her mouth, arms wrapping around her to pull her close, breasts crushed against my chest...can still feel your cock, hard and heavy, burning me through your pants*

<b>Harry:</b> What would you like next?  *another soft murmur, slowly grinding up into you as elena pulls back, eyes smudged, lips bruised, looking completely debauched and utterly beautiful*

<b>Karl:</b> *opening my eyes, smiling slowly at her, hair a tangled midnight cloud around her face*  *murmurs*  I want to fuck her, Sin...

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly*  So do it.

<b>Karl:</b> *starts to sit up, then stops when one small hand touches my chest, the other curling around my cock, quickly stroking me back to full erection*  Sin, are you...  *trails off, eyes wide when she smiles over my shoulder at you, then climbs up to straddle my lap*

<b>Harry:</b> I'm right here.  *hands still steady around your waist, watching over your shoulder as she sinks down, taking you deep, thighs trembling as she starts to ride you, nice and slow, gripping the arms of the chair for support*

<b>Karl:</b> Fuck...  *soft groan, head falling back on your shoulder again, hand gripping her waist as she shifts, leans back to give you a perfect view of my cock sliding in and out of her...hips lifting, pushing deep into slick heat, back against you*

<b>Harry:</b> *holding tight onto your waist, mesmerized by the sight of her sinking down onto you, then lifting up, your cock glistening, pushing full and thick into slick heat, bond fully open so i can experience everything as you are, keeping control by the barest of threads*

<b>Karl:</b> *one hand shifting, slipping over her hip to splay against her lower stomach, thumb dipping into damp curls to circle the tiny nub, and her moans spur me on, driving me deeper inside her with each thrust, licking my lips as one small hand comes up to cup a breast, red-nailed fingers pinching the nipple, knowing you've got an exquisite view of everything that's happening*

<b>Harry:</b> *elena's gaze locks with mine and she smiles, chewing her lower lip, before she gasps, shuddering with another orgasm, thighs clenched tight as she slams down, burying you deep inside her*

<b>Karl:</b> *her muscles tighten around me, milking my cock, and her moans as she trembles are sweet...can feel our bond, wide open, flooding with dark emotion, lust, need, want, and it all pushes me over the edge with a few more thrusts, burying myself deep inside her, harsh groan as the world splinters*

<b>Harry:</b> *once again holding you as you slump back against me, and the only sounds for a long time is your harsh breathing mingling with hers as you both come down*

<b>Karl:</b> *turns my head just enough to nuzzle your neck as she rests against my chest, sated for the moment, still very aware of your cock pressing against me*

<b>Harry:</b> *tilting my head back, not quite biting back the moan when your teeth hit a sensitive spot, shifting again underneath you*

<b>Karl:</b> Sin...  *soft murmur, waiting until I have your full attention, deliberately shifting my hips against you*  Wanna watch you now...

<b>Harry:</b> Watch me what, epaei?  *pressing up again, cock painfully hard behind my zipper*

<b>Karl:</b> *lifting my head to look at you with dark eyes, twisting a little as she slides from my lap, gloriously nude except for black leather boots wrapping around her thighs and a dark smile*  Take her.

<b>Harry:</b> *insolent, dark gaze raking over elena, and you slide off my lap, pulling me to my feet before dropping back in the chair and gesturing me towards her*  *in spanish*  Are you ready, devochka?  *unzipping the leather, thumbs hooking the sides as i shove them down my hips*

<b>Karl:</b> *curling up in the chair, one leg draped over the arm as I watch with a small smile*  *Elana nods, stepping towards you, full breasts swaying as she licks her lips and looks down at your cock*

<b>Harry:</b> *quietly, to elena, gesturing at you*  Bend over in front of him, love.

<b>Karl:</b> *watches the both of you, small smile still curving my lips as she bends at the waist, hands braced on the arms of the chair, taut nipples enticingly within reach*

<b>Harry:</b> Got a good enough view?  *to you, but not waiting for an answer as i drive deep inside her with one brutal thrust, burying myself in slick and wet, fingers bruising her hips*

<b>Karl:</b> Fuck yeah...  *softly, watching her face as she cries out softly, rocking back against you, and I glance over to the left, perfect view of everything in the mirror over the dresser*

<b>Harry:</b> *i've waited too long to take my time, much too long to go slowly.  i simply drive into her, one hand tangled in the silky fall of her hair as i watch the slip and glide of my cock in and out of tightslick heat*

<b>Karl:</b> *looking up at you, dark smile curving my lips as I reach out to fondle one breast, thinking how beautiful she looks like this, debauched, light film of sweat covering bronze skin...and you...fuck, you look so hot like this*

<b>Harry:</b> *my eyes meet yours in the mirror, and i change angle, pressing up/deeper, reaching around with my other hand to slide between slick folds, rubbing over her clitoris, smiling when she tightens, convulses around me*

<b>Karl:</b> *my free hand drops to my lap, idly stroking myself as I watch you fuck Elana, so incredibly turned on by her soft moans as she continues to rock back against you, by the soft, wet sounds of your cock sliding in and out of her, by the quiet grunts you make with each thrust*

<b>Harry:</b> *i wrap my hand more firmly around her hair, tugging sharply just as she comes, back bowed, muscles tightening around me in almost unbearable heat*

<b>Karl:</b> *continuing to stroke myself as I watch the two of you, shifting to slide forward in the chair so I can lick along her neck*

<b>Harry:</b> *leaning forward, meeting your tongue with my own, sharing a slow, scorching kiss as i thrust in deep one last time, biting your lower lip as i spill deep inside her willing body*

<b>Karl:</b> *free hand tangles in your hair, tugging hard as I feel you tremble, feel our bond surge with your release, and I can feel her tremble against me as she comes again*

<b>Harry:</b> *continuing to kiss you, still moving inside her, still hard, haven't had nearly enough of her, of you, of the three of us together*

<b>Karl:</b> Amazing, isn't she?  *murmurs against your lips, one hand sweeping up her side, fingers dancing over her ribs, tongue licking along your bottom lip*

<b>Harry:</b> Mmhmm.  *smiling into our next kiss, still gliding, stickyslick, inside her, getting off on just her broken, breathless moans*

<b>Karl:</b> So hot like this, Sin...  *whispering, tongue tangling with yours, hand still buried deep in your hair*

<b>Harry:</b> yeah?  *sliding almost completely out before slamming forward, burying myself to the hilt in willing flesh, running a hand along the curve of her back*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah...  *smiling at your expression when she bends forward a little more, my fingers tangling with yours in her hair as her head drops to my lap*  You look so hot fucking her...

<b>Harry:</b> *i brush her hair back from her face when she nuzzles your groin, tongue snaking out to lick at your length, still whimpermoaning with each slow, measured thrust*  could do this all day... *squeezing your fingers*

<b>Karl:</b> *leaning back in the chair, biting my lip as I nod*  Yeah...  *breath catches in my throat as her lips close around me and I meet your eyes*

<b>Harry:</b> *slow, wicked smile, rocking in time with her bobbing movements over you, loving the way you look right now, all slumped in the chair, one hand on the back of her head, guiding her as my cock continues to claim every inch of her*

<b>Karl:</b> *pushes our bond wide open as my head falls back against the chair, hand tightening in her hair, hips lifting to meet her mouth, watching the slow slide of your cock into her through the mirror*

<b>Harry:</b> *the next orgasm is more of a gentle glide than the full out assault the first one was, and my fingers dig into her hips, still shuddermoaning in the afterglow*

<b>Karl:</b> *the fully open bond works both ways, and your orgasm pulls me under with you until I arch up, groaning as I spill down her throat*

<i>**hours later**</i>

<b>Harry:</b> *fingers running through your hair as you sprawl over me, sheets rumpled, elana plastered to your other side, sleeping like the dead*

<b>Karl:</b> *sleepy smile, head resting on your shoulder as I listen to Elana's soft breathing against my back, her soft curves pressed tight against me*

<b>Harry:</b> did you enjoy yourself, epaei?  *very quietly*

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, I did.  *lifts my head just enough to flash you a sweet smile*  Did you?

<b>Harry:</b> very much so.  *still stroking your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> Good.  *another smile, snuggling into your warmth, one arm draped loosely over your stomach*

<b>Harry:</b> *softly, in spanish, brushing my lips across hers*  Where would you like us, devochka?

<b>Karl:</b> *I smile as her soft, almost musical voice replies, telling you anywhere but here, bending my head to lick along her neck as she continues to undulate between us*

<b>Harry:</b> *meeting karl's gaze once again, grinding into silken curves one last time before stepping back, crooking my finger*  Come.  *immediately swallowed by the crowd, not looking back, knowing you'll follow*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckling at her still slightly dazed expression, taking her hand and leading her through the packed bodies, making sure I don't move too fast...not entirely sure she can keep up in those heels, eyes on your back the entire time*

<b>Harry:</b> *a taxi is already waiting outside when you both finally catch up with me, and i open the back door with a slight bow*  After you, epaei.

<b>Karl:</b> *grinning, giving you a hard, quick kiss before sliding into the taxi and moving all the way over to make room for Elena when you help her in*

<b>Harry:</b> *giving the driver instructions in rapid spanish to a hotel on the other side of the city, parting elena's legs easily, rubbing the soft juncture of her thighs under the small skirt*  Tell her what you're going to do to her first, love.  *quietly, watching her eyes widen*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft laugh in her ear as she shifts under your touch, my own hand resting comfortably on her thigh as I nibble her earlobe*  First, I'm going to undress her slowly and kiss every inch of this delectable skin.  Then...  *voice dropping to a husky murmur*  I'm going to taste her...

<b>Harry:</b> *my fingers inch higher, parting slick flesh, already anticipating sliding my cock into the wet silk of her...but first i want to watch you take her*  Bet she tastes incredible.  *thrusting one finger, then two inside her, swallowing her gasp with my lips*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah...  *licking down her neck, blowing lightly across damp skin as one hand slides just under the edge of her top to cup a full breast, almost laughing when I catch movement from the corner of my eye as the driver adjusts his mirror*

<b>Harry:</b> *my lips are stained red from elena's lipstick when i finally lift my head, twistturning my fingers deep inside her, watching your hands in fascination*

<b>Karl:</b> We need...  *soft, edgy laugh as I push the small top up just enough to expose one breast, thumb brushing the nipple, almost groaning when a small hand finds its way into my lap*  We need to hurry up and get there, Sin.  Before I take her on this seat...

<b>Harry:</b> Patience, epaei... *thumb brushing across her clitoris, giving you a satisfied smile when she tightens her hand around you, the long column of her throat exposed as she throws her head back, coming hard on my hand*

<b>Karl:</b> She's pretty like this...  *breathes the words, pushing up against her hand, leather tightening over my crotch, eyes locked with yours*  Give me your hand, Sin...

<b>Harry:</b> *very reluctantly easing out of her, placing my slick hand in yours*

<b>Karl:</b> *curling my fingers around your wrist, still not looking away from your eyes, smiling because I know she's watching avidly as I bring your hand to my mouth and slowly slide my tongue along your fingers*

<b>Harry:</b> *eyes going dark, watching my fingers slide in and out of your mouth, wondering how she and i taste together, our bond completely open, swirling with too many dark emotions to count*

<b>Karl:</b> Couldn't wait.  *dark smile as I lean across her to kiss you slowly, placing your hand back in her lap*

<b>Harry:</b> I don't blame you.  *licking my lips, still tasting you, as the cab pulls up at the hotel*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckling as I help her out of the cab, waiting while you pay the driver, one arm curled securely around her waist*

<b>Harry:</b> *careful not to touch or look at either of you while i walk to the consierge and procur a suite for the night, very aware of the two of you behind me, certain that you're both presenting a very lovely, very debauched picture*

<b>Karl:</b> *not really caring who's looking as I kiss her, both hands settled firmly on her ass to pull her flush against me, feeling you through our bond as you pay for the room*

<b>Harry:</b> *striding towards the elevator, not waiting for either of you, making my way up to our room & leaving the door unlatched, making myself comfortable in one of the easy chairs in the living room of the suite*

<b>Karl:</b> Plan on staying dressed?  *grinning when we finally arrive a few minutes later, having been delayed by the elevator, my shirt half-unbuttoned, her skirt riding almost high enough to reveal her underwearless state to the entire world*

<b>Harry:</b> For the moment.  *even tone, sprawled gracefully, my gaze missing nothing as it rakes over you both*  Are you?

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes you calmly as I lean against the dresser*  I hadn't planned on it.  *raises an eyebrow*  You want me to?

<b>Harry:</b> If it were up to me, you'd always be naked, wearing only your ring, that tongue stud and your earring, with a tattoo proclaiming you as my property.  *feral grin*

<b>Karl:</b> *my smile matches yours when I straighten and finish unbuttoning my shirt, shrugging out of it as I gesture Elena closer*  Find a tattoo artist.

<b>Harry:</b> *eyes narrowing, the pleasure of the evening and the delectable vision in front of us forgotten for the moment*  What are you saying, epaei?

<b>Karl:</b> You want me to wear a mark that says I'm yours?  *one eyebrow raised as I pull her to stand in front of me, facing you, my hands resting lightly on her bare waist*  Find an artist.

<b>Harry:</b> You'd do this?  Truly?  *Shocked for the first time in a very long time*

<b>Karl:</b> Is that so hard to believe?  *softly, more than a little amazed at the countless emotions flooding the bond*  I belong to you, Sin.  Always have, always will.

<b>Harry:</b> I love you.  *not surprised that my throat closes over the words, still too stunned to do little more than sit there*

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *soft smile, letting the bond speak for me as I watch you, thumbs absently brushing the hem of Elena's top*

<b>Harry:</b> I'll...um...tomorrow.  Alright?

<b>Karl:</b> Whenever you want me to get it.  *tilting my head to the side, still watching you*

<b>Harry:</b> *Quietly*  Thank you.

<b>Karl:</b> You don't have to thank me.  *just as quietly, smiling*  Told you...I belong to you.  You own me.

<b>Harry:</b> Yes.  As you own me.  *gaze flickering to elena*  *softly, in spanish*  And thank you, devochka.  I think he's neglected you long enough, don't you?  *smiling at her shy nod*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles*  That a hint, Sin?  *eyes locked with yours as my hands slide higher, cupping her breasts through the thin cotton of her top*

<b>Harry:</b> She's been more than patient with us.  *watching in fascination as she sidles back against you, arching into your hands*

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, she has.  *slow smile, bending my head to nuzzle her neck as my fingers slip under the hem of her top and tug it up, pleased when she lifts her arms for me*

<b>Harry:</b> *her breasts spill into your hands perfectly as the shirt flutters to the floor and she twists in your embrace, placing tiny licklets along your neck*

<b>Karl:</b> *kissing her shoulder, feeling her hair slither over my skin as she moves her head, continuing to watch you, wondering what you're thinking as my fingers tease her nipples into tight, dark peaks*

<b>Harry:</b> *both of you are so beautiful, dark and not quite of this world, as tanned fingers pluck and tease dusky nipples, and your thigh presses forward, sliding her skirt high along her legs*

<b>Karl:</b> She's so fucking responsive, Sin...  *murmurs as her head falls back against my shoulder, knowing she's watching you through her lashes as my hands slide down over her flat stomach, fingers just barely touching the line of buttons that holds her skirt on*

<b>Harry:</b> Do you blame her?  *sharing a secretive smile with elena*  You'd reduce a monk to begging.

<b>Karl:</b> Oh really?  *amused smile, fingers deftly releasing the buttons so her skirt can fall free, leaving long legs encased in black leather boots*

<b>Harry:</b> Absolutely.  *letting my gaze traverse slowly along elena's lush body, chuckling when she agrees with me in that low, musical voice*

<b>Karl:</b> I'll have to remember that.  *flashes you a wicked smile as one hand comes up to cup a full breast, the other dropping to tease dark curls as she rubs back against me*

<b>Harry:</b> *i laugh again when she breathless informs us that we're like women, speaking too much when there's more pleasure to be had in this night*  Quite right, love, quite right.  You should keep his mouth occupied, you know.

<b>Karl:</b> *I just grin as I nudge her towards you, following*  I plan on keeping my own mouth occupied in just a second.  How'd you like a front row view, Sin?  *amused smirk as we stop right in front of you, and I turn her around to face me*

<b>Harry:</b> I'd love one.  *soft murmur, waiting to see what you're going to do next*

<b>Karl:</b> Good.  I was hoping you'd say that.  *dark smile as I whisper in her ear...your expression is priceless when she sits in your lap, leaning back against your chest, arms up to curl around your neck*  How's this?  *slides to my knees in front of the two of you, hands sliding up her thighs, pushing her legs apart*

<lj-cut text=""Clubbing..."">
<b>Harry:</b> *leaves a note on the bed where you'll be certain not to miss it before quietly letting myself out, the running shower muffling the sound of the door shutting behind me*

<b>Karl:</b> *minutes later, the shower shuts off and I emerge, towel wrapped around my hips*  Sin?  *looks around for you, then spots the note*  Oh ho...

<b>Harry:</b> *already out of the hotel, smiling when i feel the curiosity in our bond*  Find me.  *softly repeating the words on the note*

<b>Karl:</b> *amused, looking for something to wear when I discover that your new leather pants are missing* Ahh...so that's how it's going to be, hmm?  *smiling to myself as I pull out a few articles of clothing*

<b>Harry:</b> *taking my time while walking along the crowded streets, ignoring the many admiring glances from both men and women alike.  the only thing i want is you.*

<b>Karl:</b> *finally dressed, feeling silk shift across my shoulders as I stamp my feet lightly so the boots fit just right*  Let's see how long this takes...  *stepping out of the hotel, letting our bond pull me through the streets, easily dodging hands with an instinctive, unconscious grace*

<b>Harry:</b> *finally i feel you in pursuit and i twist & turn down the narrow streets, ducking into alleyways, across empty lots, through crumbling buildings, leading you further and further across the city*

<b>Karl:</b> *pausing for a moment to get my bearings, then continuing, curious to see how far you'll take me*

<b>Harry:</b> *another small smile when i feel you closing in on me and i duck into another building, dampening the bond until it's almost undetectable*

<b>Karl:</b> *I almost stumble when the bond goes flat...can still feel it, but can't get a lock on it*  That's cheating, Sin...  *murmuring to myself, glad for the darkness that's settling over the city as I step into a shadow and shift, relying on a keener sense of smell to track you*

<b>Harry:</b> *down another alleyway, across a mostly deserted courtyard and into a slumbering neighborhood into an outdated industrial section of the city*

<b>Karl:</b> *padding through the shadows on silent feet, eyes glittering as I cross pools of moonlight, catching your scent and increasing my pace to an easy lope*

<b>Harry:</b> *the building is full of wildy undulating bodies all swaying to a hard industrial beat, and i duck inside, making my slow way across the dance floor, swaying and twisting with the crowd, knowing you'll find me*

<b>Karl:</b> *laughing inside my head as your trail ends...so you found this place on your own...taking a moment to shift back, shrugging to settle my shirt across my shoulders as I step inside the club, intent on only one thing, and that's you*

<b>Harry:</b> *finally making my way to the bar, hair matted to my forehead, mesh shirt plastered to my chest, trousers molded to my skin, and i down my first shot in silence, waiting for another*

<b>Karl:</b> Now what's a boy like you doing in a nice place like this?  *amused smile as I slip through the crowd and lean one elbow on the bar beside you*

<b>Harry:</b> Waiting for a boy like you to relieve my boredom.  *slight smile, downing my next shot before sitting on the bar stool and tugging you into my lap*

<b>Karl:</b> Bored, hmm?  *flashing you a look over my shoulder as I settle into your lap, deliberately wiggling as I do so*

<b>Harry:</b> Very.  *already tugging at your laces, the movement lost under the loose fold of your shirt, signalling to the bartender for another round with my free hand*

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe we should do something to fix that, then.  *calmly as your fingers move around my crotch, gesturing for the bartender to just leave the bottle*

<b>Harry:</b> *shifting slightly, tugging the leather just over your hips before reaching around you for the bottle, taking a slow sip*  Maybe we should.  *unzipping my own pants, cock already slick, ready, and i lift you slightly, impaling you on my cock, pleased at how readily you accept me*

<b>Karl:</b> *biting my lip to stifle the moan as you fill me, hands resting lightly on the bar*  Would hate to think you're bored on our vacation.

<b>Harry:</b> *the slightest press forward of my hips, cock pulsing deep inside you as i look around, seemingly still bored, gazing at the dancers with a dispassionate air*  yeah, well, i'm old.  seen it all.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, I know.  *bites back a gasp as you do that again, one hand sliding to curl around the edge of the bar*  Haven't seen it all with me...

<b>Harry:</b> Working on it.  *slowly flexing my hips but making no other outward movement, taking another long pull from the bottle*

<b>Karl:</b> *fingers tight on the bar, managing a small smile when the girl next to me looks over at us*  Working on it is good...  *voice only slightly breathless*

<b>Harry:</b> Nice song.  *easy, conversational tone, pulsing again, flexing, shifting in slow movements before asking the pretty, young girl for a cigarette*

<b>Karl:</b> Not bad.  *resists the insane urge to laugh when she hands you one and lights it, closing my eyes for a moment in an effort to regain my control in what, I already know, is a hopeless battle*  Good beat.

<b>Harry:</b> *taking a slow drag, feeling the acrid burn in my lungs, flexing up, rotating my hips slightly*  And you can dance to it.  Would you like to?

<b>Karl:</b> Now?  *both hands gripping the bar now, focusing on one bottle behind the counter, feeling each shift, each beat of your heart*

<b>Harry:</b> If you'd like.  *another slight press, dropping the block on the bond, flooding you with all of my lustlovewant, taking another drag from the cigarette and using it as an excuse to shift again deeper in you*

<b>Karl:</b> *the emotions that slam into me are all that's needed to shove me over the edge, and my head falls back against your shoulder as I struggle to remain quiet*

<b>Harry:</b> So pretty *soft murmur against your neck, pressing up one last time before going still, sliding you off of my cock and quietly relacing your pants*

<b>Karl:</b> *shuddering as your hands brush sensitive skin, too breathless to speak for the moment*

<b>Harry:</b> *slowly finishing my cigarette, allowing you time to ease down*

<b>Karl:</b> *picking up the bottle and taking a long swallow before realizing it, then coughing, eyes watering as the liquid burns down my throat*

<b>Harry:</b> *soft, amused chuckle*  Developing a taste for single malt, epaei?

<b>Karl:</b> Vile stuff.  *gasping for air, voice hoarse*  I'll stick with vodka, thanks.

<b>Harry:</b> *still chuckling, ordering you a shot of stoli, taking a quick moment to zip my pants up, placing a soft kiss to the back of your neck*  I guess I'll have to teach you to like it, then.

<b>Karl:</b> Thanks, but I'll let you keep it.  *downs the shot, leaning back against your*

<b>Harry:</b> Ready for that dance now?

<b>Karl:</b> *listens for a moment*  Song's changed.  *grinning at the slower, more seductive beat playing now*

<b>Harry:</b> *small smile*  Perfect.  *throwing down enough money for the drinks and a generous tip before dragging you to the crowded dance floor*

<b>Karl:</b> *stepping close to you, one arm draped over your shoulder, hips in perfect alignment as we start to move*  Guess I was wrong this afternoon.

<b>Harry:</b> About?  *swaying easily to the heavy bass beat, seeking the sleek skin just under your shirt*

<b>Karl:</b> You not remembering that trick.  *grins at your expression, hips rubbing against yours, fingers tangling in the hair at your nape*

<b>Harry:</b> *dryly*  I wasn't dead that long, love.  *slow grind, rubbing slow circles along your lower back*

<b>Karl:</b> *letting my head fall back, eyes half closed, lips parted in a soft smile*  True...and parts of you are very much alive right now...

<b>Harry:</b> It's the song.  *very seriously, easing my hands just under soft leather, resting over your hips*

<b>Karl:</b> Is it, now?  *amused look, hips swiveling with yours*

<b>Harry:</b> Mmhmm.  *deft fingers unlacing the leather again as i drop to my knees before you, paying no attention to the undulating bodies surrounding us, just giving you a slow wink before leaning forward and lifting your shirt slightly, lips closing tight over your cock a second later*

<b>Karl:</b> *head falling back again, eyes fully closed, fingers sinking into your hair, not giving a damn who sees, hips moving in time with the music as your tongue slides along my cock*

<b>Harry:</b> *slipsliding along your length, cheeks hollowed, nails digging into butter-soft leather as i fill my mouth with you*

<b>Karl:</b> *moaning softly, lost in the music, lost in you, fingers dragging through silky hair as I thrust into wet heat*

<b>Harry:</b> *pushing forward, eyes closed, tongue swirling over the head, tasting musk and clove every time you push forward, hitting the back of my throat*

<b>Karl:</b> *lifting my head and opening my eyes, still very much lost in what you're doing, and all I can do is smile slowly when my eyes lock with those of a very pretty young girl watching us, and my hand moves to cradle the back of your head*

<b>Harry:</b> *taking the silent hint, sensing amusement mixed with the dark want in our bond, and i speed up, closing my lips tightly around you, creating a tight, wet suction, choking myself on your length*

<b>Karl:</b> *continuing to watch her through half-lidded eyes, smiling as my orgasm rolls through me, fingers tightening in your hair as I force myself to stay upright and she smiles*

<b>Harry:</b> *greedily swallowing every hotbitter drop, letting you slip from my lips reluctantly*  Love how you taste.  *raising dark eyes to meet yours*

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *murmurs, smiling down at you, well aware that she's still watching*

<b>Harry:</b> *graceful slither up your body, taking my time about relacing your pants, smiling into your eyes*  Which one?  *softly, knowing i don't need to explain further*

<b>Karl:</b> Just off your left shoulder.  *licking at your lips, tasting myself there*  Dark hair to her waist, dark eyes, long legs, body to kill for....

<b>Harry:</b> *quick, appreciative glance back, slowly smiling into kohl-smudged eyes*  You want her?

<b>Karl:</b> *lets my eyes roam over her, impressed with how she never looks away, never looks embarrassed*  Yeah...  *softly, tongue sliding over my bottom lip as I smile*  You?

<b>Harry:</b> *drinking in the sight of endless, fishnet-clad legs*  Yeah.  *twisting back around, biting gently on your earlobd*  You can have her, if you want.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah?  *a little surprised as I look up at you, hard again at just the idea*

<b>Harry:</b> *Slight, careful nod, cupping you through soft leather*  I want to watch as she rides you.

<b>Karl:</b> *shivering, pushing against your hand, aware that she's still avidly watching us as she dances*  Sin...you serious?

<b>Harry:</b> *softly, eyes never leaving yours*  You ever known me to joke about something like this?

<b>Karl:</b> Never known you to offer.  *half smile*

<b>Harry:</b> Do you want her?

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *very softly, slow nod, hand resting on your hip*

<b>Harry:</b> *stepping aside, brushing the backs of my fingers across your cheek*  Then take.

<b>Karl:</b> You'll be close?  *suddenly unsure, eyes searching yours*

<b>Harry:</b> Right here, I promise.

<b>Karl:</b> I love you.  *murmurs, kissing you, fingers brushing yours as I step past you, moving towards her, smiling when she starts to move in my direction*

<b>Harry:</b> *still swaying to the heavy rhythm of the song, watching out of lowered lashes when you pull her into your arms and the two of you start to move together, lethal, seductive, dark*

<b>Karl:</b> *can feel your eyes on me as I move with her, her body molding to mine...full hips fill my hands, and my thumbs brush soft skin just above her skirt*

<b>Harry:</b> *watching ever shift and sway of hips, the slow seduction as she rubs against you, dark red lips parted softly in invitation*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes lock with yours over her head as I bend to taste her lips in a brief kiss, feeling our bond hum with dark lust*

<b>Harry:</b> *very pretty.  the heels of her boots bring her to within a couple of inches of your height and it only takes a slight incline of your head to taste what she so willingly offers.  i smile, dark and hot, pleased when you catch your breath.  enjoy her, epaei, but never forget that i own you, always will.*

<b>Karl:</b> *my hands slip down and around, cradling the curve of her ass, pulling her flush against me as I lift my head and look at you again, smiling when she continues to dance against me, her movements now very slowly pulling us in your direction*

<b>Harry:</b> *staying in place, swayshifting as the song changes, glides into something dark, dangerous, full of driving guitars and throaty vocals, the visceral kick of the music matched only by the sight of the two of you, dancing inexorably closer, pausing only to sample and tease exposed skin*

<b>Karl:</b> *our momentum across the floor stops only when we're directly in front of you.  I can feel the heat coming from you as you watch us, watch me with my hands on her, one still cupping her ass, one resting in the small of her back where the skin is exposed by her outfit.  I meet your eyes, see the dark look in them, and I swear I didn't think it was possible to get harder, but I do, and I know she can feel it*

<b>Harry:</b> *stepping directly behind her, the faint scent of vanilla teasing my nostrils, but i keep the slightest distance between us, just resting my hands over yours, meeting your gaze over her shoulder as she continues to rock into you*

<b>Karl:</b> Sin, meet Elena.  *murmurs, voice barely audible over the music, moving in perfect rhythm with the beat, hips cradled against hers, feeling your fingers flex on mine*

<b>Harry:</b> A pleasure.  *dark whisper just against her ear, smiling when she shivers, arching back into my heat, then forward into yours, using your hands to roam over her skin, slipping under the hem of her skirt*

<b>Karl:</b> *I smile at the look in your eyes when you discover what I already knew --  there is nothing between the tiny skirt and delicious bronze skin but air*  She's very friendly.

<b>Harry:</b> Is she?  *raking my teeth along the soft curve of her neck, shifting our hands to the front of the skirt, then down, parting slick folds with gentle fingers, giving you a small smirk when she stiffens, moans, then relaxes under our combined touch*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles as one slender arm lifts over her head to curl around your neck, her head dropping to the side*  And very appreciative of the performance.  *another soft chuckle when she opens her eyes enough to flash me a dark smile, my free hand trailing up over her ribs, fingers drifting across the low-cut neck of her blouse, tugging it out just enough so you can see*

<b>Harry:</b> Did you?  *murmuring in her ear, feeling, rather then seeing, her nod, slipping one finger inside slick heat, following your gaze*  Very pretty.

<b>Karl:</b> I thought so.  *smiles, bending my head to lick along her throat, one finger easing in beside yours, chuckling softly as she jerks a little, her soft moan lost in the music*

<b>Harry:</b> *settling into a tortuously slow rhythm with you, meeting your lips over her shoulder, teasing your tongue, coaxing it into my mouth as my thumb brushes over the small nub, other hand roaming over her side, then yours*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue curling around yours, groaning when you start to suck on it, feeling her trembling against me, long nails digging into my shoulders as her hips buck against our hands*

<b>Harry:</b> *parting our lips just long enough to watch her as the combined movements of our fingers in and over her bring her to a shuddering release, smiling into her sated, dazed eyes*  Very pretty, devochka.

<b>Karl:</b> And it's just started...  *murmurs in her ear when she turns her head just enough to offer you her lips*

<lj-cut text=""Afternoon on the beach..."">

<b>Karl:</b> *sprawled on a blanket, eyes closed, skin glistening with a light layer of oil, soaking up the sun as the kids nap beside me, half dozing as I wait for you to return*

<b>Harry:</b> *yeah, definitely a sight for sore eyes.  i grin and drop noiselessly beside you, naked and wet from my swim in the ocean and run my fingers along the back of your thigh to the crease of your knee*

<b>Karl:</b> *shifts a little, making a quiet sound but not bothering to open my eyes as I smile*  *murmurs*  Tickles...

<b>Harry:</b> But in a good way.  *moving my fingers back up your thigh, slipping between your cheeks, running along the crease, smiling when you shift again*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft sigh as my hips lift a little, pushing against your hand, body already responding*  Didn't say it was bad.

<b>Harry:</b> *taking the bottle of oil & running it over the crease, slipping two fingers inside you, leaning close to your ear*  *quietly*  Have I had you on this stretch of beach yet?

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath, almost gasping as my eyes open halfway and one hand fists in the blanket*  Not yet...

<b>Harry:</b> *fingers scissortwisting deep inside you, brushing your sweet spot with every movement, nibbling just under your ear*  Wanna?

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah....  *ragged breathing, tilting my head to the side as your lips slide over my skin, pushing back against your hand*

<b>Harry:</b> *dark smile & i withdraw my fingers, rolling onto my back, idly stroking my cock*  Ride me.  

<b>Karl:</b> *pushing up to my hands and knees, smile matching yours as I reach for the oil and move to straddle your thighs*

<b>Harry:</b> *placing my hands on your hips, balancing you, bond pulsing, spilling over with love and need*

<b>Karl:</b> *hands slick with oil close around you, sliding along your length as I watch you*  Love you...  *whispering as my hips lift, shift, and then I'm sinking onto you, lower lip caught between my teeth as my body stretches around you*

<b>Harry:</b> Ti ochen' nuzhna mne *murmurs, breath hitching as i fill you, sinking into incredible tight heat, tangling a hand in your hair as i lift my head to meet your lips with a hard kiss*

<b>Karl:</b> What?  *starting to move, hips rolling against you, lips meeting yours again to tangle our tongues together*

<b>Harry:</b> Need you... *biting your lower lip, shifting my hips under you in minute degrees*

<b>Karl:</b> You have me...  *muscles tightening around you as I move*

<b>Harry:</b> More.  *barely breathing the word before sucking hard on your tongue, gasping when you tighten muscles around me & i sharply grind up, need searing into me*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue curling around yours, fingers sliding over your chest, seeking out every sensitive spot as I continue to rock in slow, steady movements*

<b>Harry:</b> *deepening the kiss, fingers tangled deep in your hair, thrusting up with sloppy, desperate movements, finesse forgotten in the need to bury myself deep inside you*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft laugh against your lips, not speeding up, keeping everything slow, deliberate, thumbs brushing over your nipples*

<b>Harry:</b> *soft growl, neatly flipping you over, spreading your thighs, pounding into you, my kiss one of furious need*

<b>Karl:</b> *instantly locking my legs high around your waist, drawing you deeper, fingers digging into your back as I lift my hips to meet each hard, near-bruising thrust, opening our bond wide*

<b>Harry:</b> *instantly flooded by a wealth of emotion & it's too much...moaning your name as i come hard, sparks dancing behind my eyes*

<b>Karl:</b> *tongue tangled with yours, hands gliding along your back, deliberately clenching my muscles around you*

<b>Harry:</b> *another deep growl, slumping on top of you, but still moving, brushing your prostate with every movement*

<b>Karl:</b> *moving with you, nuzzling the side of your neck*

<b>Harry:</b> *reaching between our oil and sweat-slicked bodies & grasping your cock, rocking inside you*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft whimpermoan, bucking underneath you, head falling back on the blanket*  Fuck....

<b>Harry:</b> Thought I was.  *wicked grin, wrist flicking in time with my thrusts, still hard*

<b>Karl:</b> *manages a soft snort, opening my eyes to give you a challenging look*  That what you call this?

<b>Harry:</b> Not wanting to kill you.  *winks, deliberately slowing my movements*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes flicker with a faint blue light as I push our bond open even wider, still smiling as my body matches your every movement*  Won't kill me...

<b>Harry:</b> Beg.  *Now barely moving, hand loosely wrapped around your cock, eyes locked with yours*

<b>Karl:</b> *beg...evil bastard...I lick my lips, tighten my muscles again*  Harry...

<b>Harry:</b> *dark smile, pulling almost completely out, just the head of my cock resting inside you*  Beg.

<b>Karl:</b> Harry, c'mon...  *one hand tangling in your hair to pull you down, nipping at your lower lip, lifting my hips in an effort to take you deeper*

<b>Harry:</b> *Not moving*  No.

<b>Karl:</b> Please?  *flashing you my most charming smile, legs tightening around your hips*

<b>Harry:</b> No.  *Lips curving in a small smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *smile quickly turns into a frown*  C'mon, Harry...please?

<b>Harry:</b> Uh uh.  *Barest of movements, pushing forward, then settling back in place*

<b>Karl:</b> Harry, stop teasing...  *lifting my hips, trying to force you deeper*

<b>Harry:</b> I never tease.  *another slight movement*

<b>Karl:</b> Liar...  *soft gasp, shifting beneath you*  Harry...

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah?

<b>Karl:</b> Please...  *through gritted teeth, quickly growing frustrated*

<b>Harry:</b> Please what?  *shifting again, pressing in just a little more*

<b>Karl:</b> Fuck me.  *low growl, shifting restlessly*

<b>Harry:</b> *eyes flaring bright, almost gold, pushing hard until i'm completely inside you*  Tell me.  *starting a hard, brutal rhythm*

<b>Karl:</b> Love you...  *manages to get out, body automatically adjusting to your rhythm, hips lifting to meet each thrust, welcoming this*

<b>Harry:</b> Who owns you?  *not really a question, still pounding you into the blanket, fist tightening over your cock, nothing gentle in my movements*

<b>Karl:</b> You...  *gasping, fingers digging into your hips as I writhe beneath you, bond flaring up, pulsing in time to match yours as our bodies move together*

<b>Harry:</b> Tell me.

<b>Karl:</b> Belong...to you...  *soft cry, starting to lose myself in the overwhelming sensations*  I belong to you...

<b>Harry:</b> Yes, mine.  *flicking my wrist again, thrusting deep at the same moment, flooding the bond with love and possessive need*

<b>Karl:</b> *almost screaming your name as I arch up, orgasm ripping through me in a white-hot rush, mind splintering, feeling you moving deep inside me still*

<b>Harry:</b> Again.  *Still moving, bringing you back to full hardness with your own come, fist gliding brutally fast, biting on your lower lip*

<b>Karl:</b> *moaning, no clue what I'm saying, just going with it, moving with you as my mouth seeks yours*

<b>Harry:</b> *tongues tangling together, dueling as we move together, still hard, fast, rough*

<b>Karl:</b> *bond pulsing, flaring up, twisting and curling around yours, sensations and emotions sweeping through me too fast to keep up with, welcoming each hard, rough thrust inside me

<b>Harry:</b> Again.  *harsh growl, hitting your prostate with every thrust, eyes glittering, open, watching every expression on your face*

<b>Karl:</b> *crying out as I'm overwhelmed, fingers spasming on your hips as I come hard, spots dancing behind my eyes*

<b>Harry:</b> *slow smile, brushing a few strands of matted hair from your forehead*  Beautiful.

<b>Karl:</b> *struggling to breathe as I open my eyes and focus on your face*  Yeah...

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *softly, kissing your cheek*  I love you.

<b>Karl:</b> Love you.  *suddenly, deliriously happy*

<b>Harry:</b> *rolling off of you, pulling you into my arms, smiling*  Think I'm going to keep you naked on the beach.

<b>Karl:</b> *soft laugh*  I sure as hell won't argue with that.

<b>Harry:</b> Think anyone would miss us?

<b>Karl:</b> Doubtful.  *faint, sad smile*  Vig might if he ever remembered to come out of his workroom.

<b>Harry:</b> Hey.  *soft smile, stroking your cheek*  Their loss.  I've got all I need right here on this blanket.

<b>Karl:</b> Me, too.  *smiles, snuggling against you*  Just you and the kids.

<b>Harry:</b> And the beach.  *nuzzling your neck*  The sun, the waves, you naked...

<b>Karl:</b> And the clubs...  *hiding my smile against your shoulder*

<b>Harry:</b> Clubs?  *tilting my head to look at you*

<b>Karl:</b> Mmhmm...  *giving you a bland look, but my eyes are twinkling*

<b>Harry:</b> You're thinking.  *can't help but smile back*

<b>Karl:</b> *half shrug*  Been a long time since we went clubbing.

<b>Harry:</b> Would give me an excuse to wear these new leather pants I just bought... *muses*

<b>Karl:</b> *sits up straight, startling the kids on the corner of the blanket*  New leather pants??

<b>Harry:</b> *hiding my smile*  Mmhmm.  *resting on the blanket, giving you an angelic smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes you*  You bought new leather pants and didn't tell me about them?

<b>Harry:</b> You were out.

<b>Karl:</b> Could've told me when I got back.  *dark look, then muffled laughter when the kids pounce you, Vidam landing squarely in your lap*

<b>Harry:</b> Well, hello there.  *grinning, picking up vidam & rubbing noses with her*  *conversationally, not looking at you*  No, I bought them here.

<b>Karl:</b> Did you now?  *eyes you again, scooping up Szoros*  And you were planning on telling me when?

<b>Harry:</b> Wasn't.  *grins, stroking vidam's back*  They're in your suitcase.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, caught off-guard*  Why're they in my suitcase?

<b>Harry:</b> So you'd find them, of course.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks again*  Dunno why you put them there.  Not like I've really worn anything out of it since we got here.

<b>Harry:</b> *grins*  For which I'm very grateful.

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, I know.  *smug grin*  So you're going to model these pants for me, yes?

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.

<b>Karl:</b> *eyebrow arched*  Maybe?

<b>Harry:</b> Maybe.  *smiles, tapping your chin*

<b>Karl:</b> Well, then...maybe I'll let you tag along with me to that club I found while I was gone earlier...  *slow smile, starting to get to my feet*

<b>Harry:</b> Tag along?  *pulling you back down beside me*

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe.  *slow smile, not resisting*

<b>Harry:</b> Well, if you don't want me to wear them for you, I suppose I could go out on my own in them.  And the mesh shirt I bought.  *slow smile*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyebrow arches again*  Gee...and here I was going to wear that black silk shirt tonight that you love so much...

<b>Harry:</b> Well, I'm certain someone else will enjoy it just as much.  *nonchalant smile, standing & brushing sand from the backs of my legs, cradling vidam*  Since you didn't pack it for me.

<b>Karl:</b> No?  *sly smile, standing up as Szoros scampers in the sand, gathering up the blanket*  Funny...I was positive I saw that shirt hanging in the closet before I came down here...black silk, long sleeved, button up, hangs to mid-thigh on me...

<b>Harry:</b> I know the shirt, epaei.  *softly*

<b>Karl:</b> Packed the black leather lace-up pants to go with it...  *trails off, finished folding the blanket, watching you from the corner of my eye*

<b>Harry:</b> Did you?  *glancing at you*

<b>Karl:</b> Mmhmm...

<b>Harry:</b> I see.  *non-commitally, slipping into my flops & heading out, grabbing the basket, vidam wrapped around my neck*

<b>Karl:</b> But, you know, if you're not interested...  *catches up and passes you, Szoros watching you over my shoulder*  Probably forgot how to do that trick, anyway.

<b>Harry:</b> It's not going to work, love.  *catching back up to you, keeping your stride*  If you want my company tonight, just ask for it.

<b>Karl:</b> Of course I want your company.  *quietly*  I wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't.

<b>Harry:</b> *stopping*  Then I'll be happy to come with you.

<b>Karl:</b> *stopping a step ahead of you, small smile curving my lips*  Thank you.

<b>Harry:</b> Welcome.  *hard smack on your ass as i pass by you*

<b>Karl:</b> Bastard.  *growls, catching up to you*  So you really got new leather pants?

<b>Harry:</b> Mmhmm.

<b>Karl:</b> *waits as we walk back to the room*  *then*  Well?

<b>Harry:</b> Well, what?  *letting vidam down so she can scamper after szoros*

<b>Karl:</b> What do they look like?  *glancing at the kids as they scamper through the running water by the door to rinse the sand out of their fur*

<b>Harry:</b> Check your suitcase.  *giving you a soft kiss*

<b>Karl:</b> *watches for a moment as you catch the kids and start to dry them, then moves to pull my suitcase out and look*  Harry...  *frowns as I pull the pants out and hold them up*  You sure these are going to fit?

<b>Harry:</b> Mmhmm.  *starting the hairdryer, smiling*

<b>Karl:</b> *looks carefully at your ass, then back at the pants*  This I've got to see.

<b>Harry:</b> Later, epaei.  *smiles*

<b>Karl:</b> Of course.  *smiles, settling down beside you as the kids wiggle happily in the stream of warm air*

<b>Harry:</b> *watching with a fond smile when they finally scoot off in search of one of my socks, no doubt*  This was a good idea.

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, it was.  *smiles, crawling over to straddle your lap*

<b>Harry:</b> *framing your hips, nuzzling your neck*  love you so much.

<b>Karl:</b> Love you more.  *whispers against your hair, smelling sun and salt and you as I close my eyes*

<b>Harry:</b> Doubtful.  *Smiles*

<b>Karl:</b> We'll argue about it later.  *smiles, arms wrapped tight around you*

<b>Harry:</b> We won't argue at all.  *cradling you close*  

<b>Karl:</b> Like that idea even better.  *snuggles against you, too comfortable to bother with a shower just yet*

<b>Karl:</b> *slowly walks up to the door, debating the wisdom of being here as I take a deep breath and ring the doorbell*

<b>Ice:</b> *pushes back from my desk with my foot, pencil twirled in the hair to hold it back, making sure the information would be caught while i'm away, going to the door, sliding my blue sunglasses down on my nose at who is at the door*  karl....

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *small smile, just standing there, hands deep in my pockets*

<b>Ice:</b> *stands a moment longer, just staring, before drawing you into a tight hug, nearly shaking with relief...i'd assumed and guessed...but to have you standing in front of me...something different entirely* 

<b>Karl:</b> *arms immediately go around you, hugging you tight, face buried in your hair, relieved to be home and around my friends again*

<b>Ice:</b> *refuses to let go for quite some time, finally pulling away, ducking my head, avoiding your eyes, voice husky*  no need to just stand out here, come in, i'll make some tea  *turns away, taking the moment to wipe my eyes, sniffing as quietly as i can as i walk to the kitchen, i'm not that relieved, really i'm not...*

<b>Karl:</b> *pretends not to notice when you wipe your eyes, following you into the kitchen*  Anything exciting happen while I was gone?

<b>Ice:</b> *snorts at your casualness as i put the pot on, and shake my head*  i've had lots of quiet time with dae, getting to know again the person i loved for so long.  *leans against the counter, waiting for the water to heat, watching you as i speak gently*  how are you, karl? 

<b>Karl:</b> *looks around the room, never looking directly at you*  I'm good.  Taking a teaching job at the university so I can stay home.

<b>Ice:</b> sounds like a wonderful iidea ... *scowls slightly when you won't meet my eyes*  are you good?

<b>Karl:</b> *finally looks at you, half-hearted smile*  I've been better, but...yeah, I'm good.

<b>Ice:</b> i'm glad  *returns the smile*  and harry....?

<b>Karl:</b> He's doing better.  *shrugs, leaning against the counter*  Still has some really bad days, but he's getting there.

<b>Ice:</b> and he's _here_ ... *notes the water's hot, prepares the tea quickly, pulling the strainers out when it's ready*  i'm sorry about lawrence...i know how much he meant to you.  *smiles thinly, not liking things any more than i had when i'd first heard, but that does not mean i begrudge you the sympathy nor deny your sorrow*

<b>Karl:</b> Thank you.  *very softly, looking down and swallowing hard against the lump in my throat*

<b>Ice:</b> of course... *hands you the cup of tea, watching you quietly for a moment*  your bond with harry...it was renewed?

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, sipping the tea*  It came back the exact second he did.

<b>Ice:</b> and you suffered no ill effects when lawrence....?

<b>Karl:</b> *can't quite suppress the shudder that hits me*  Oh, I did.  The bond with Harry's the only thing that kept me sane.

<b>Ice:</b> karl...i'm so sorry you had to go through that....*reaches out to lightly touch your cheek, tearing up again so i turn, busying myself with rinsing out the pot*  

<b>Karl:</b> *deep, shaky breath*  thanks.

<b>Ice:</b> you don't need to thank me, karl.  is there anything i can do now?  i know i'm a horrible cook, but dae is a wonderful cook and could prepare you a few casseroles or something?  *smiles*

<b>Karl:</b> Actually, we're good as far as that goes.  *quick smile*  The restaurant's sent over several meals.  What would help...  *deep breath*  Is just to have our friends around.

<b>Ice:</b> i'm always here for you and harry, karl, do not ever doubt that.  the place is free for your disposal, night or day, call, drop by, anything.  just know i am here.

<b>Karl:</b> *nods*  I know.  *quietly*  I think Harry needs to be reminded of that.

<b>Ice:</b> *frowns, watching you*  he would never doubt our friendship...would he?

<b>Karl:</b> He's been doubting a lot recently.  *very quietly, looking down*  Mostly me and what we have together.  But...I think he just needs to be reminded that people are there for him.

<b>Ice:</b> of course....he's doubting you because of lawernce?  *tilts your chin up so you look at me, concerned for the both of you*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah...  *slow nod, not pulling away*

<b>Ice:</b> *frowns, biting my tongue a ten-count before speaking*  he should know better.  but you both need time to heal and relearn the other and why you love them.  i assume that's what you've been doing in all these months without a phonecall?  *voice lightens*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, it is.  *faint smile*  That and...other things.

<b>Ice:</b> other things?  *eyes you*  like...what other things?  although, spare me the details of your love-life, i don't need to hear about every kiss and every wank.  

<b>Karl:</b> *muffled laughter*  With Harry around, do you honestly think I need to wank, love?

<b>Ice:</b> *pretends to think about this a moment*  you're right.  you'd think he was a horny teenager half the time.  

<b>Karl:</b> You mean the half when you think I'm not a horny teenager, right?  *grins*

<b>Ice:</b> *rolls my eyes*  incorrigable, that is what you are  *wags a finger accusingly at you, grinning*  

<b>Karl:</b> You have NO idea.  *winks*

<b>Ice:</b> i'm sure i don't want to.  *smiles back, dipping my fingers quickly in my tea, flicking them at you*  

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe, maybe not.  *not bothering to wipe off the droplets, just returning the favor & flicking tea at you*

<b>Ice:</b> insolent bastard, respect your elders *speaks dryly, but loses the effect when i start laughing, wiping the tea from my face, frowning at the droplet on my glasses, removing them to clean them off on my shirt*  

<b>Karl:</b> *snorts*  Try that one on someone who didn't have you fleeing the room at one point.  *smirks and lounges, rather insolently, against the counter*

<b>Ice:</b> fleeing?  *snorts*  i hardly fled.  i do not flee *raises chin haughtingly*  i merely chose an opportune time to leave.

<b>Karl:</b> You fled.  *continues to smirk, one hand idly tapping on the counter*

<b>Ice:</b> i do not flee, msr. urban *taps you on the chest*  never have, and never will.  just ask harry.  

<b>Karl:</b> *leans close, nose almost touching yours, still smirking*  You, m'lady, fled...whether you admit it or not.

<b>Ice:</b> *stands my ground, eyeying you, cursing and turning away, setting my tea cup on the counter*  i choose my battles, karl.  *smiles sweetly*  

<b>Karl:</b> *leans back against the counter, grinning openly*  Call it what you will, Ice.

<b>Ice:</b> of course, i'm never wrong.  *huffs, rinsing out my cup, grabbing yours while i'm at it*  

<b>Karl:</b> No, of course not.  *voice heavily laced with amusement as I watch you*

<b>Ice:</b> *rolls my eyes, drying my hands off on a towel, snapping you with it before hanging it up, leaning back against the counter*  i'm glad you two are back, karl, i really am.  *smiles faintly*  

<b>Karl:</b> I'm glad we are, too.  *soft smile*  Missed you.

<b>Ice:</b> missed you, too.  *eyes you warily*  you guys don't plan on running off again any time soon, do you?  i swear to the powers, i'll hunt you down and .... do something drastic.

<b>Karl:</b> *secretive smile*  Oh, I dunno...not much holding us down here.  Just the restaurant...new job at the university...a few busybody friends...

<b>Ice:</b> and it's those busybody friends who you should be afraid of, never know what they might do when at wit's end *wags a finger at you, grinning*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft snort*  those busybody friends don't scare me.  i know their weak spots.  *winks*

<b>Ice:</b> now, is that any way to treat an old friend?  *attempts to keep a scolding look on my face, failing miserably*  abuse their weaknesses?  i'd thought better, really karl.  *laughs, shaking my head*  

<b>Karl:</b> *laughs*  You should know me better than that.  But...I should make amends.  *another secretive smile as I look around, then pick up a small wooden dowel, not needing to know what you had planned for it*  May I?

<b>Ice:</b> *eyes you, curious what you mean to do*  yeah, i can always buy another.  just...try not to get any splinters on the floor, we like to walk barefoot around here.  *grins*

<b>Karl:</b> No splinters, I promise.  *smiles and holds the dowel in my fingers, barely glancing at it as I feel the energy flow through me into it, aware that my eyes are glowing as I feel the wood soften and twist under my fingers*

<b>Ice:</b> *smiles, watching you work, wishing more than once i could do anything like this, leaning against the counter, eyes wide*  that is...beautiful karl.  you know how much simpler life would be if i could just....i don't know...make a chair when i needed one.   

<b>Karl:</b> You need chairs?  *quick grin, eyes still glowing as the dowel continues to twist and writhe, one end bursting open, forming into a perfect white rose*

<b>Ice:</b> no .. *laughs delightedly, touching the petals*  it's lovely, karl.  and no, i don't need chairs...now. 

<b>Karl:</b> For you.  *smiles, offering the rose with a spectacular flourish*  Not as beautiful as you, but...I'm still learning.

<b>Ice:</b> *accepts the rose with a smile*  always the charmer.  careful, you'll have dae turning jealous.  *winks, chuckling*  

<b>Karl:</b> I'll be sure to create a dozen next time, then, in front of her.  *winks*

<b>Ice:</b> ah, you trouble maker you.   *grins, shaking my head*  and leave me to deal with the aftermath.  why, she might kick me out to the couch!

<b>Karl:</b> You're always welcome at our house.  *tiny smirk*  Our bed's plenty big if you don't mind Harry snoring.

<b>Ice:</b> i don't mind his snoring, but his feet just smell something terrible.  *winks*  

<b>Karl:</b> Oh, they're not too bad now that I make him change his socks daily.  *grins*

<b>Ice:</b> oh, good.  i'm glad his habits have changed over the years.  well, in that case, i'll keep that option open if i end up on the couch.  *matches your grin*

<b>Karl:</b> *smiles, stepping close, one hand brushing your cheek*  You know you're always welcome, anytime you want to come by.

<b>Ice:</b> and i will, there's an old friend i haven't seen in quite some time whom i miss dreadfully.  *covers your hand with mine*

<b>Karl:</b> He misses you, too.  *softly, leaning in to kiss your forehead*

<b>Ice:</b> i will call on him, remind him what i look like. *smiles, pulling you into a hug*  

<b>Karl:</b> He'd like that.  *hugging you tight, face buried in your hair*

<b>Ice:</b> *clings, reluctant to let go, finally pulling back*  i'm being silly.  it's not like you're going anywhere.  

<b>Karl:</b> not anytime soon, no.  *smiles*  we're home finally.

<b>Ice:</b> *returns the smile, laughing lightly in agreement even as i feel my throat tighten again*  gah, you're determined to make me cry.  bastard  *grumbles, finally smiling up at you*  welcome home, karl.  

<b>Karl:</b> thank you.  *fingers brushing your cheek again*

<b>Ice:</b> welcome.  thank -you- for the rose, luv, i need to have you stop by more often, spruce up the place a bit *winks*

<b>Karl:</b> If you promise not to kill them between visits, I'll give you all the pretty plants you want.  *grins*  You should see what I've done with our garden at the house.

<b>Ice:</b> *smiles, shaking my head*  i think i'd offend dae in asking.  she loves working in the garden, i'd not dare interfere.  but i'll have to see your garden when i'm over there.

<b>Karl:</b> Then I'll just have to content myself with bringing you flowers.  *winks*

<b>Ice:</b> *sighs melodramatically*  i suppose that'll have to do.  the same goes for you luv, stop by, anytime.

<b>Karl:</b> I will.  And you can help me grade papers when the time comes.  *chuckles*

<b>Ice:</b> *rolls eyes*  oi, that sounds dreadfully boring.  well, as long as you give me a red pen with plenty of ink, i'll have my fun.

<b>Karl:</b> *laughs*  I'm actually looking forward to it.

<b>Ice:</b> *grins*  it'll keep you busy, that's for certain.  maybe i'll have to drop in on a class or two. 

<b>Karl:</b> You should.  *nods*  I've been promised some of the best classes.

<b>Ice:</b> i might just have to do that.  would be entertaining, if anything, i'll be sure to come with obscene questions.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm counting on it.  *wicked grin*

<b>Ice:</b> even better.  maybe i'll catch you off-guard.  *smiles innocently*  

<b>Karl:</b> Remember who I live with.  *winks and straightens up, hugging you again*  I should get going before he starts to worry.

<b>Ice:</b> *returns the hug, then shoos you out the door*  yes yes, i don't want him to worry, he'd have my head later.  

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, and it's much too pretty attached to your body.  *grins as I start down the walk*

<b>Ice:</b> you're a terrible flirt, you know.  *smiles*  take care, karl.  and tell harry i'll be stopping by...give him my love.

<b>Karl:</b> I will.  *walking backwards, smiling at you*  And you take care, too, love."

<b>Harry:</b> *walking into the house, not bothering to call out since i know you're not inside.  instead, i head straight out back towards the beach, studying you as you sit on the beath, look of utter relaxed concentration on your face.  our bond thrums with some sort of odd energy, but i can't quite make it out. the kids settle happily--and *very* damp--on my lap when i sit beside you, waiting until you notice me*

<b>Karl:</b> *I can feel the excitement pouring from the kids, but I try to focus for a few more minutes.  No good.  You're here now.  I don't even have to open my eyes to know that*  Hey.

<b>Harry:</b> Hey.  *softly, taking your hand, lacing our fingers together*  What exactly *are* you doing?

<b>Karl:</b> Nothing now.  *quick grin*  Got distracted.

<b>Harry:</b> *eyes you*  Fine, what were you doing?  

<b>Harry:</b> The bond's all twisted.

<b>Karl:</b> Just...an experiment.  *shrugs*  Twisted?  Twisted how?

<b>Harry:</b> Twisted in over itself.  And almost grey.  *probes, frowning*  Not bad, just odd. 

<b>Karl:</b> Sorry.  *quickly releases all the energy I've been holding so the bond will settle and straighten out*

<b>Harry:</b> You're not going to tell me, are you?

<b>Karl:</b> I was...practicing.  *sidelong glance, wondering how you're going to take this*  Seeing if I could shift into something besides a panther.

<b>Harry:</b> *blinks*  Do what?

<b>Karl:</b> *shifting uncomfortably*  Was trying to change into something other than a big cat.

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah, I heard that.  *still watching you*  What makes you think you can do that, epaei?

<b>Karl:</b> Well, I have better control over MYSELF than I do over the actual earth so far.  So I thought...  *another shrug*  Nevermind.  Dumb idea.

<b>Harry:</b> It's not dumb.  *squeezing your hand*  You truly need to stop acting like experimenting is a bad thing.  Just...next time ask me.  I may not know everything about your bond, but I do know quite a lot.

<b>Karl:</b> Just thought this was something I could do on my own.  *quietly*  So can I?

<b>Harry:</b> Not unless you're a lot more powerful than either of us realize.  Which, you might be, but we'd have to ask Marisol.

<b>Karl:</b> So how do we do that?  *bites lip, realizing how overeager I sound*

<b>Harry:</b> You know how.  *chuckles*  Same way I call up every other Thracian.

<b>Karl:</b> *makes a face*  In other words, I get to be the anchor again.

<b>Harry:</b> Unless you'd rather not.

<b>Karl:</b> No, it's okay.  *smiles*  Kinda curious to meet my...sister-in-law.

<b>Harry:</b> She's...unusual.  *grins*  But I won't say anymore.

<b>Karl:</b> Alright then...  *nods, taking a deep breath*  Suppose we may as well do this.

<b>Harry:</b> You act like this is pulling teeth, epaei.

<b>Karl:</b> Sorry.  *smiles*  Just...get a little nervous when you vanish is all.

<b>Harry:</b> *softly*  I'm coming back.  I promise.

<b>Karl:</b> *nods*  I know.

<b>Harry:</b> *takes both of your hands, breathing deep, centering myself and wrapping around our bond, sinking deep*

<b>Karl:</b> *holds your hands securely, watching you as my earth bond surges, anchoring you as you seek Marisol*

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, Christ on...that bloody...*Opening my eyes, shaking my head as I orientate myself*  Who the hell are you?  *peers, narrowing my eyes*  Diana?  That you?

<b>Karl:</b> Sort of.  *weak smile as I watch you, wondering if this is how Harry feels when he hears my voice take on a feminine tone*  Diana is...a former version of me.

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, you must be the new version.  *Smiles*  Look at how handsome you are.  Harry must be thrilled, the daft cunt.  Why am I here?  *Glances around*  And where are we?

<b>Karl:</b> Actually, I'm the last version.  *smiles*  And thank you.  We're in New Zealand, where Harry and I live.  And you're here because...umm...

<b>Marisol:</b> Because Harry obviously needs my help with this.  *playfully twanging your bond*  Very nice.  Good color.  Suits you.

<b>Karl:</b> Harry's always said so.  *grins*

<b>Marisol:</b> Alright, *Rubbing these lovely, large, masculine hands together*  Show me what you can do with it.  Go on, I won't bite.  *Clamps teeth together experimentally*  Unless you want me to.  Does it hurt when Harry does?

<b>Karl:</b> Only when we're in the mood to play rough.  *grins and winks, then takes a deep breath, immediately centering myself and sending my power out, watching you as I do so*

<b>Marisol:</b> *Settling in, seeking out your bond.  Oh, this should be a lot of fun, haven't done this in so long*

<b>Karl:</b> *pretty sure my eyes are glowing, feeling the energy build as it spirals out, smiling to myself at the look in your eyes*

<b>Marisol:</b> Ooh, look at you.  *Proud grin*  You're beautiful like this.  Now, *hands fluttering*  do something with it.  Go on.

<b>Karl:</b> I have to be careful with it.  *absently, energy splitting and racing through the earth*  Sometimes end up doing something a lot more powerful than I thought I could...  *grows silent as the energy splits again, each thread coalescing into what I intended, watching you to see your reaction*

<b>Marisol:</b> Very nice.  *Approving smile*  But can you do something like this?  *Taking your bond, I split it yet again, twisting and curving it until it's feeding back into itself, the blue glowing so bright it lights us both from the inside*  Pretty, isn't it?

<b>Karl:</b> *pays close attention to what you did, then smiles*  You mean this?  *repeats your actions exactly until there are multiple tendrils splitting and looping back into each other*

<b>Marisol:</b> *Claps in joy*  Oh, I'm so proud of Harry.  I didn't think he was paying any attention that day.  *Shooting the tendrils into the air, spinning them faster, humming when the earth around us crackles and parts, sand disappearing and reappearing in different shapes*

<b>Karl:</b> *moves quickly, gathering the tendrils back up, weaving them into a smooth, even flow of energy that moves across the beach, scooping up sand and forming it into vaguely human shapes that dance and caper around us*

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, how marvelous.  *Splintering the energy again, and the beach now hums with a heavy, tribal beat, the shapes dancing to the beat*  Feel like joining them?  *Standing, taking your hand*

<b>Karl:</b> This should be interesting.  *grins as I stand and start to move with you, laughing as the kids scamper around us, taking care to stay out of the way*

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, let them join.  *Smiles, snapping my fingers and they appear in my hands, blinking owlishly at me*  And who are these fine creatures?  *Nuzzles their fur*  

<b>Karl:</b> Now that is an interesting trick.  *murmurs to myself, bond flaring as it sorts out what you just did*  This is Szoros *touches his head* and she's Vidam.  Closest thing to children that I have.  *soft smile*

<b>Marisol:</b> And they adore you just as much, don't you, guys?  *Bright smile at both of them, then snapping my fingers again.  Now they're in your arms, looking a little confused*  So, let's chat.  *Abruptly, we're in a green meadow, the sounds of a babbling creek reaching us as I sit cross-legged, patting the space next to me*

<b>Karl:</b> *head spins a little at the abrupt change in location, absently using my hands and energy to soothe the kids as they scramble into my shirt*  How...no.  *shakes my head as I sit down, bond already snapping and popping*

<b>Marisol:</b> No?  Oh, don't say that.  I don't like that word.  *Smiling*  Now, tell me why I'm here in this rather cumbersome body.  I don't see how Harry moves around in it.  

<b>Karl:</b> Gimme a minute and it'll figure itself out.  *grins as I sit beside you, cradling the kids close*  And, as you said, you're here because Harry needed the help.

<b>Marisol:</b> So, ask your questions.  We're here, alone, it's a nice day out.

<b>Karl:</b> *takes a deep breath, then asks the one that's been worrying me the most*  How strong am I?

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, very.  *Shrugs, hands fluttering again*  What did you expect, with Lawrence and myself and Harry in there?

<b>Karl:</b> Honestly...I didn't know what to expect.  *faint smile*  I've had to learn all this on my own.

<b>Marisol:</b> On your...*Bristles*...that arrogant, stupid man.  He should be helping you!  The sheer...

<b>Karl:</b> He doesn't really know what to do.  *quickly, quietly*  I'm all earth, and that's definitely not his specialty.

<b>Marisol:</b> He's known me all his life.  No excuse.  That's it, he's not coming back until we're finished.  

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks rapidly*  Not...but you WILL let him come back...right?

<b>Marisol:</b> When I'm ready.

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes narrow slightly*  And that will be when?

<b>Marisol:</b> When I'm ready, young man, and not a moment before.  Now, ask your questions before we lose the light and have to move someplace else.

<b>Karl:</b> *continues to watch you closely*  Again, how strong am I?  What can I do?  What can't I do?  Can I shift into anything else?

<b>Marisol:</b> You're very strong.  You can do many things...and many things will be a puzzle, just as they are to everyone else.  *Smiles*  And of course you can't shift into anything else.  You're a Thracian, not a changling.  Honestly, didn't Harry tell you anything?

<b>Karl:</b> So this doesn't count?  *swiftly plucking the kids out of my shirt and dropping them into your lap before my form shifts, flowing into the panther so I can circle you on silent paws*

<b>Marisol:</b> *blinks*  Interesting.  But no.  It doesn't.

<b>Karl:</b> *sits in front of you, tail curled around my paws, yawning as I watch you*

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, don't give me that, Karl.  *Pats you on the head*  A cute parlour trick, but nothing more.  Lawrence is a clever sort, I'll give him that much.

<b>Karl:</b> *catches your hand in my jaws and holds it for a moment before letting go, looking down as the kids slither out of your lap and start to prance around my front paws*

<b>Marisol:</b> You all must have a lot of fun like this.  *Frowning, I search your bond, nodding in appreciation at the marvel of work Lawrence did*  Isn't that interesting?

<b>Karl:</b> *shifting, flowing until I'm kneeling in front of you again*  Actually, the kids don't usually get to see me in that form.  *eyes you*  What's interesting?

<b>Marisol:</b> What Lawrence did.  Here, feel.  *Placing my hand over yours, letting you feel the crackle and burn*

<b>Karl:</b> You forget...I'm new to this.  WHAT did he do?

<b>Marisol:</b> Very ancient trick.  Nasty one, too.  Afraid you can't break it.  *Soft smile, cupping your cheek*  I'm sorry, Diana, I truly am.  He was such a good boy.

<b>Karl:</b> *lightly gripping your wrist*  I'm not looking to break it.

<b>Marisol:</b> Good thing.

<b>Karl:</b> Now that that's settled...  *sits back so the kids can crawl up in my lap*

<b>Marisol:</b> We're finished already?  Good, I was starving anyway.  *Dropping us in a small cafe, looking around the bustling room with a grin*  I used to own this spot.  Only it wasn't quite so busy.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, guess we are finished.  *tucking the kids into my shirt as a waiter approaches*

<b>Marisol:</b> *Ordering in rapid Italian, beaming when I turn back to you*  So, tell me about yourself.

<b>Karl:</b> What would you like to know?  I'm Karl, by the way.  *very faint smile*  And I'm the last in a very long line of me's.

<b>Marisol:</b> The last?

<b>Karl:</b> The last.  *looks up, smiles when the waiter returns with our drinks*

<b>Marisol:</b> Explain.  *Sipping of the frothy liquid*  I love a good mimosa, don't you?

<b>Karl:</b> I'm more a vodka person myself.  But I don't drink much anymore.  *smiles*  And I'm the last because I'm not mortal.  *simply*

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh!  *Claps hands, beaming*  He finally did it, didn't he?  Good for Viggo, I knew he'd do it sooner or later.

<b>Karl:</b> Took more than just Vig, but yeah.  He did it.  *smiles*  *quietly*  I'm also Harry's mate.

<b>Marisol:</b> Of course you...oh.  Oh my, now why didn't I see that before?

<b>Karl:</b> Because you weren't looking.  *soft smile*  It's a pretty complex bond we've got.

<b>Marisol:</b> So I see, Karl, so I see.  *Polishing off my drink, then yours and ordering two more*

<b>Karl:</b> *settles back in my chair, watching you*

<b>Marisol:</b> Yes?  *Sipping on my new drink, smiling over the straw*

<b>Karl:</b> *shakes head*  Just thinking.

<b>Marisol:</b> I've heard that's dangerous.  *Smiles*  So, tell me.

<b>Karl:</b> Just that you're not at all what I expected.

<b>Marisol:</b> Which was?

<b>Karl:</b> Not quite as crazy as you apparently are.  *smiles*

<b>Marisol:</b> *Archly*  I prefer the term eccentric, thank you.

<b>Karl:</b> *amused smile*  Eccentric is a good word for it.  Not quite completely honest, but it'll do.  *winks*

<b>Marisol:</b> Honesty is so overrated, darling.  Now, tell me all about yourself.  *smiles as our plates are set in front of us*

<b>Karl:</b> Not much to tell, really.  *returns the smile*  I'll be 31 next week, I'm bonded to Harry, the last in a long line of me's, and you've seen what I can do.

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, but that's so boring.  Tell me something interesting.

<b>Karl:</b> Interesting?  *takes a bit, chewing slowly as I watch you*  I'm diabetic and manic.

<b>Marisol:</b> Now, that's much more like it.  *leaning forward on my elbows, studying you*  Does Harry know?

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, to both.  *small shrug*  He's know about me being diabetic for years.

<b>Marisol:</b> I can't imagine giving up sweets.  *wrinkles my nose, sipping my soup*  Tell me about the bond.  Why you?  I'd have thought he'd have given it to Diana, out of anyone.  How does Marton feel about it?

<b>Karl:</b> I can still have sweets, I just have to be very careful how much I eat.  *shifting, ignoring your last question*  As for why me...because he once told me that I'm the perfect version.

<b>Marisol:</b> Perfect version of what?  *setting down my spoon, frowning* 

<b>Karl:</b> Of me.  His soulmate.

<b>Marisol:</b> Thought Marton was... well, nevermind that.  How *is* Marton?  God, I haven't seen him in an age.  Course, I've been dead, so to speak.  *chuckles at my own joke*

<b>Karl:</b> *eyes you closely*  Thought Marton was what?

<b>Marisol:</b> *arches my brow*  Well, darling, you should know.  You've seen them together, haven't you?  Not that it matters, really.  It worked for Harry & the others, I'm sure it's working for you.  *sighs, looking at my--Harry's--hand*  Such a complex man, I never could understand that.  Our world isn't so complicated.

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, I saw them together.  *quietly*

<b>Marisol:</b> So you know.

<b>Karl:</b> That Harry's in love with him?  *lifts my head to meet your gaze*  Yeah, I know.

<b>Marisol:</b> It's much deeper than that.  *returning your gaze*

<b>Karl:</b> Is it?  *softly*

<b>Marisol:</b> You *know* it is.  *taps your wrist*  In your blood, in that bond you have with him.

<b>Karl:</b> I think I'd rather have you just tell me what you mean.  *quietly, not moving, watching you*

<b>Marisol:</b> You may be his soulmate, young man, and I'll not deny that.  But Harry's soul isn't just yours.

<b>Karl:</b> No, I suppose it isn't.  *small shrug, returning my gaze to my meal*  I live with it, though, and Harry and I get along okay.

<b>Marisol:</b> How's Marton with having to share with a bondmate?

<b>Karl:</b> There was nothing to share.  *quietly*  They were just friends after Harry met me.

<b>Marisol:</b> Just friends?  *soft laugh*  They may not have been intimate, but there's never been anything *just* about them.  

<b>Karl:</b> I know that.

<b>Marisol:</b> You never did answer my question.

<b>Karl:</b> Which one?  *fork halfway to my mouth*  You've asked several.

<b>Marisol:</b> All about Marton, and don't think I don't know you're evading the issue.  *finishing my soup with a loud clatter of my spoon*

<b>Karl:</b> *calmly sets my fork down, appetite gone*  Marton's dead.

<b>Marisol:</b> He's... *slow blink, setting a gentle hand over yours*  I'm so sorry, love.  How...when...?  *my mind whirls with so many questions*  And Harry?

<b>Karl:</b> Before Halloween.  *flatly*  Harry's doing better now.

<b>Marisol:</b> That long?  *small voice, glancing down*  My God.  I had no...poor Harry.  

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *very quietly, just looking at my plate*

<b>Marisol:</b> I'm sorry.  *softly*

<b>Karl:</b> I'll pass that along to Harry.  *just as softly*

<b>Marisol:</b> Please do.  Marton and I were... *soft smile* ...he was almost a brother to me.  He was there the day Vincent and I joined the others.

<b>Karl:</b> I didn't know that.

<b>Marisol:</b> Oh, I'd be surprised if you had.  Non-Thracians weren't invited to witness the Return.  Marton was the very rare exception.  *blinks back unexpected tears*  Gone...

<b>Karl:</b> *swallows at the unexpected pain those words bring, then reaches for my glass of water*  Yeah.

<b>Marisol:</b> I...I should get back.  *quietly*  

<b>Karl:</b> *shifts in my chair, setting my glass down*  I'm sorry.

<b>Marisol:</b> As am I.  *i place my hand over yours again, and we're back on the beach once more, your house visible just beyond the dunes*  Please give Harry my best.  And Hugo...if he's still around.

<b>Karl:</b> I'll tell them both.  *quietly, staring at the small island/sandbar not too far off shore, numb inside for some odd reason*

<b>Marisol:</b> *giving into impulse, i pull you into my arms for a long hug*  I am sorry, sweetie.  More than you can imagine.

<b>Karl:</b> Not your fault.  *quietly, one hand wiping quickly over my face when you release me*

<b>Marisol:</b> *thumbs brushing over the tear tracks*  You take good care of each other, alright?  And your furkids.  *attempts a smile*

<b>Karl:</b> I'm taking the best care I can of him.  *half shrug, looking at the water again*  It'll be easier once I've got this under control.

<b>Marisol:</b> Practice at it.  Get Hugo to spar with you...he used to be a lot of fun.  And remember the three rules, should you get lost.  *pats your cheek before sinking back through the bond, back to vincent*

<b>Karl:</b> Three...  *stops, realizing you're gone and Harry's slowly returning*

<b>Harry:</b> *haze clearing, shaking my head to clear it as i take a deep breath*  Fuck...I'm too old for this...*mutters*

<b>Karl:</b> You okay?  *softly, watching you*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah...*rubbing a hand over my eyes* ...I will be.  She's...well, the more powerful they are, the harder it is, to...shake them...when they go.

<b>Karl:</b> *nods*  Makes sense.

<b>Harry:</b> She would bring him up, too... *sighs*

<b>Karl:</b> Him...oh.  *nods, looking down*

<b>Harry:</b> I'm sorry.

<b>Karl:</b> For what?  *faint smile*  You didn't know she'd go there.

<b>Harry:</b> I should've known she'd ask.  *idly tracing the sand with my finger*  They were very close, odd as that is to fathom

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath*  He was close to your entire family.

<b>Harry:</b> Yes.  *glancing up at you*  He was.

<b>Karl:</b> So, um...  *folds my hands in my lap*  What are the three rules?

<b>Harry:</b> What three... *frowns, then frowns again when memory returns*  You know, I have no idea what she's on about.

<b>Karl:</b> Great.  *shakes my head, half smiling*

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *reaching out to lace our fingers together*

<b>Karl:</b> I love you, Sin.  *softly, wincing when my voice catches*

<b>Harry:</b> I love you too, Karl.  So much.  *pulling you into my arms, careful not to crush the kids as they wiggle about under your shirt*

<b>Karl:</b> *takes a deep breath, resting against you*  Harry...why are you with me?  *very softly*

<b>Harry:</b> *glances down, puzzled*  Because we belong together.  Why're you with me?

<b>Karl:</b> Because I can't live without you.

<b>Harry:</b> Alright, then.  What's this about?

<b>Karl:</b> Just wondering.  *half shrug*

<b>Harry:</b> Out with it.  *quietly*  We said no secrets.

<b>Karl:</b> I just...I don't know.  *tiredly*  Just that sometimes I think about it, and I can't figure out why you chose me.

<b>Harry:</b> That's like asking why gravity works.  *small smile, rubbing my hands on your back*  I just do.  Always.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *faint smile*

<b>Harry:</b> I've tried my best by you.  I'm sorry if it's not enough at times...and I know it's not.

<b>Karl:</b> No, it's okay.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> No, it's not.

<b>Karl:</b> It's not?  *startled, looking at you*

<b>Harry:</b> *cupping your cheek*  You deserve more.

<b>Karl:</b> We've been over this, Harry.  *quietly*  You deserve more, too.

<b>Harry:</b> I have you.  I have all I need.

<b>Karl:</b> Do you really?

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *the word is drawn out slowly*

<b>Karl:</b> You don't sound very convinced.  *faint smile, shifting a little as the kids squirm*

<b>Harry:</b> Neither do you.  *meeting your gaze*

<b>Karl:</b> You're all I've ever wanted.  *quietly*

<b>Harry:</b> I'm right here.  *reminding us both*  Not going anywhere.

<b>Karl:</b> *half smile*  I know.

<b>Harry:</b> We should head inside.  *glancing past you to the sun setting over the water's edge*

<b>Karl:</b> Yes, we should.  *small smile as I step away, turning towards the house...before you can move, I focus, concentrate, feeling my bond snap as it mimics Marisol's earlier trick and just like that, the kids are in your arms*

<b>Harry:</b> *Startled laugh as the kids squirm about*  I was hoping she'd teach you that.

<b>Karl:</b> They seem to like it once they get used to it.  *fond smile as I listen to them squeak, taking your hand as you fall into step beside me, bond twisting, glowing, stretching...and then something like a slide and we're standing in the kitchen*  Whoa...

<b>Harry:</b> *sliding an arm around your waist, steadying you*  You alright?

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah, just...wasn't expecting that.  Didn't seem like it affected her.  *shakes head to clear it*

<b>Harry:</b> She's had centuries of practice.  *smiling*  You just learned it today.

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath*  You hungry?  *opening the fridge door, not looking back at you*  Don't let her get into that.  She made a huge mess last time.

<b>Harry:</b> *Scooping up Vidam when she lunges for the open jar of honey on the counter*  Cheeky monkey, I've told you no more than once.  *Stern voice, eyeing her*

<b>Karl:</b> She's laughing at you.  *finally glancing over, half smile, pulling salad fixings out of the fridge*

<b>Harry:</b> She keeps it up, and she won't get those carrots in the fridge I cut up just for her.  *Smiling into suddenly contrite beady eyes*

<b>Karl:</b> *chuckles*  She'll behave.  For now.

<b>Harry:</b> I know.  *setting her down and watching her scamper after szoros*

<b>Karl:</b> Hope you put your socks away.  *smiles, pulling out a cutting board and a knife*  Salad okay?

<b>Harry:</b> It's fine.  *shrugs, leaning against the counter*  They'll get into my socks anyway, you know.

<b>Karl:</b> It slows 'em down when they're in the drawers.  *quick grin as I start chopping veggies*  They have to dig through the hamper then.

<b>Harry:</b> Not that it stops them in any way.  *watching you with a small smile*  So, you never did tell me how your day was.

<b>Karl:</b> It was pretty quiet for the most part.  Had a letter from the university, did some work in the garden, rescued Vidam from the monster sock that wanted to eat her.  *half shrug*  You know...the usual.

<b>Harry:</b> Monser sock?  *leaning forward and snagging a piece of celery*

<b>Karl:</b> The little goofball crawled into your sock this morning.  Headfirst.  *shaking my head, chuckling at the memory*  By the time I got there, her entire body was stuffed into the sock and she was screeching while Szoros rolled her around trying to get her out.

<b>Harry:</b> *choking on my bite, leaning against the counter as laughter overwhelms me.  the image alone...*

<b>Karl:</b> She looked like a little white sausage.  *grins*

<b>Harry:</b> *sinking to the floor, still laughing, arms wrapped around my waist*

<b>Karl:</b> And the best part...once I finally got her out -- which was a production all on it's own, lemme tell you -- she promptly turned around, BIT the sock, and stomped off with her nose and tail in the air.

<b>Harry:</b> Fuck, that's... *laughing again, tears running down my cheeks*

<b>Karl:</b> I'm sure the poor sock was just laying there trying to figure out what it did to deserve that.  *laughs, shaking my head as I mix all the veggies in the bowl and pull out a bottle of dressing*

<b>Harry:</b> Oh, I'm sure... *still chuckling, wiping my eyes with the heel of my hand* ...I'll have to ask it next time I wear it.

<b>Karl:</b> You'll have to let me know what it says.  *grins as I mix in the dressing*

<b>Harry:</b> Provided it doesn't hie off to sock therapy.

<b>Karl:</b> It'll probably just sulk in the bottom of the hamper.

<b>Harry:</b> My socks do NOT sulk, thank you.  *finally pulling myself from the floor*

<b>Karl:</b> *soft snort, taking the bowl to the table*  No, of course not.

<b>Harry:</b> You doubt me?  *grabbing the plates and forks, following you*

<b>Karl:</b> *amused look as I move back to the fridge for the tea*  Not at all.

<b>Harry:</b> Good.  *smiling as i sit in my chair*

<b>Karl:</b> *taking care not to roll my eyes as I sit across from you*

<b>Harry:</b> *scooping some salad onto my plate*  Thanks for that.  I haven't laughed that hard in...God, ages.

<b>Karl:</b> Hey, don't thank me.  *smiles as I dish some salad out for myself*  It was your daughter that did it.  I was just the messenger.

<b>Harry:</b> Still thankful.  *soft kiss to your cheek*

<b>Karl:</b> *smiles*  I'm glad.

<b>Harry:</b> *taking a bite of the salad, nudging your knee with mine*  This is delicious, by the way.

<b>Karl:</b> Of course it is.  *smiles*  I made it.

<b>Harry:</b> Ah, the modesty of youth...

<b>Karl:</b> *grins*  Of course. So...  *quietly, concentrating on my salad*  No idea what those three rules she mentioned are?

<b>Harry:</b> Well, if she's the Marisol I know and love and want to throttle, it's probably something only she knows.  *small smile*  She was fascinated by any elemental studies and papers she could find.

<b>Karl:</b> Great.  *mutters*  Daft woman didn't bother to tell me what they were.

<b>Harry:</b> Sounds about right.  *places my hand over yours*  Probably wants you to figure them out on your own.

<b>Karl:</b> As if that'll happen.  *soft sigh*  Sin...I have no idea what I'm doing here.

<b>Harry:</b> You know the person you really need to talk to is the one person I'm not sure you'd want to even *be* around.  *sighs, throwing down my napkin, appetite gone*

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks, startled, pulling back just a little*  What?

<b>Harry:</b> Hugo.

<b>Karl:</b> Don't really think he wants to talk to me.  *looking down, appetite lost once more*

<b>Harry:</b> He doesn't want to talk to *anyone*.  *gripping your hand, waiting until you look up*  He's denying anything ever happened with him and Lawrence.  

<b>Karl:</b> Which is why I'll be surprised if he's even willing to see me.  *quietly*

<b>Harry:</b> I'll be surprised if he even acknowledges anything that happened while I was gone.  

<b>Karl:</b> Maybe not.  *deep breath*  M'sorry, Sin.

<b>Harry:</b> It's not your fault.  *puzzled frown*  Lawrence got too close to him...this is his way of dealing with it.  You can't control that.

<b>Karl:</b> *nods*  You still hungry?

<b>Harry:</b> Not really.  *glancing at the salad, then back up at you*  You?

<b>Karl:</b> *shakes head*  No.  *quietly as I reach for the plates*  I'll wrap 'em up and we can eat later.

<b>Harry:</b> Hey.  *placing my hand over yours, still your movements*  Talk to me.

<b>Karl:</b> *pauses, then sighs*  I don't know.  *very softly*  This whole thing scares the hell out of me...the stuff I can do...how everything's changed now.

<b>Harry:</b> Yeah.  *tugging you into my arms*  Me, too.  *very softly*

<b>Karl:</b> *holds you tight*  Love you so much, Harry.

<b>Harry:</b> I know.  *eyes squeezed shut, feeling your hammering heart beat against mine*  Love you, too.  Orokre.

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, feeling safe & secure in your arms, trying to relax and forget about everything for just a moment*

<b>Harry:</b> Come on.  *tugging you out the back door*  Let's walk for a bit.

<b>Karl:</b> The kids...  *hesitates, then smiles a little*  Nevermind.

<b>Harry:</b> Asleep?  *smiling at you as we take the path to the beach*

<b>Karl:</b> Almost.  Curled up in the middle of the bed.  *laces our fingers together as we walk*

<b>Harry:</b> Guess your connection with them is getting stronger?

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *softly, eyes on the path*  It's weird.

<b>Harry:</b> How's that?  *breathing deeply of the salt air as we walk*

<b>Karl:</b> Just...it's almost like they have emotions now.  *glancing up at you before looking back down*  And I get these flashes sometimes, like pictures in my head.

<b>Harry:</b> I'm sure they've always had emotions.  *squeezes your hand*  Marisol had this dog...great big husky mix.  They had a very...close empathy going on.

<b>Karl:</b> It's just a little strange.  *half smile*  Almost like I know what they're thinking, but not quite.

<b>Harry:</b> Makes it easier to watch over them, I bet.  *meeting your smile*

<b>Karl:</b> It does, yeah.  *soft laugh*  Though they keep coming up with new ways to test my patience.

<b>Harry:</b> That's their job.  *kissing your knuckles, sand sliding between my toes, water splashing at my ankles*  You wouldn't have them any other way.

<b>Karl:</b> No, I wouldn't.  *smiles, walking beside you*  Guess it's practice for if we ever have a child...  *bites my tongue hard, silently cursing myself for those words*

<b>Harry:</b> Can you sense more complex life forms?  *mild tone, squeezing your fingers to let you know it's alright*

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath*  I've never tried.  Been concentrating on building a bond of sorts with them.

<b>Harry:</b> Which is a good idea.  They already love you and trust you.

<b>Karl:</b> I love them, too.  *softly, squeezing your hand*  Thank you.

<b>Harry:</b> For what?  *stopping, cupping your jaw*

<b>Karl:</b> For giving them to me.

<b>Harry:</b> They chose me, love.  I was just smart enough to listen.

<b>Karl:</b> I know.  *smiles, leaning in to brush a soft kiss over your lips*

<b>Harry:</b> *brief flash of tongues darting together before i pull back & start walking with you again*  Let me see if I can snap Hugo out of his...denial.  Then maybe you two can work together.

<b>Karl:</b> I'm willing to take any help I can get right now.  *quietly, shoulders brushing as we walk*

<b>Harry:</b> I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

<b>Karl:</b> It's not your fault.  *glances up at you*  You're helping as much as you can.

<b>Harry:</b> Which isn't much.  *faint smile*

<b>Karl:</b> It's enough.  *smiles*  You taught me control.

<b>Harry:</b> Lucky for the world.  *grins*  You were getting scary there.

<b>Karl:</b> I was?  *startled blink*

<b>Harry:</b> An elemental without control is possibly the scariest thing there is...apart from the puppy.  *winks*  And you're not just any elemental.

<b>Karl:</b> So what am I?

<b>Harry:</b> I have no idea.  

<b>Karl:</b> *makes a face*  That doesn't help much.  *crooked smile*

<b>Harry:</b> Viggo and Vincent managed to break every rule out there...and then Lawrence shattered what was left.  *shrugs*  You're unlike any other earth elemental I've ever known.

<b>Karl:</b> How so?  *stops, watching you, curious*

<b>Harry:</b> None of the others can shift, for one.

<b>Karl:</b> *blinks*  They can't?  But I thought...

<b>Harry:</b> Go on...

<b>Karl:</b> I thought they could...Vincent said...he said he'd never seen an earth elemental in feline form...

<b>Harry:</b> *blinks*  Vincent told you earth elementals could shift?

<b>Karl:</b> Not exactly....  *trailing off as I try to remember his exact words*  He...seemed amazed that I could shift so easily, then he said he'd never seen an earth elemental in feline form.

<b>Harry:</b> Unless he knows something I don't... *shrugs* ...perhaps he meant popping, as opposed to actual shifting.

<b>Karl:</b> Popping?  *brows furrowed*

<b>Harry:</b> What you did with the kids earlier.  *shakes my head, smiling*  Marisol called it popping.  

<b>Karl:</b> You mean moving them from my hands to yours?  *faint frown, thinking that over, then slowly nodding*  I can see why she called it popping.  The bond gives a tiny little pop feeling when you do it.

<b>Harry:</b> Much like the crackle when I start a fire, I would imagine.

<b>Karl:</b> *deep breath*  Marisol didn't exactly seem surprised that I could shift.  Of course, she didn't act like I SHOULD be able to shift, either.

<b>Harry:</b> Not much surprises Marisol, so that's nothing.  She's...well, you met her.  You know.

<b>Karl:</b> Insane?  *half smile*

<b>Harry:</b> To put it mildly.  *grins, turning around, heading back towards the house*  Vincent's opposite in every way.

<b>Karl:</b> I noticed that.  *soft laugh*  Kinda like we're opposites...

<b>Harry:</b> You think that?  *tilting my head, looking at you*

<b>Karl:</b> Sometimes.  *sidelong glance*  Don't you?

<b>Harry:</b> Not in any way that matters, no.  *shaking my head*  We complement each other.

<b>Karl:</b> Opposites can do that.  *smiles*

<b>Harry:</b> So, tell me how we are, then.  *smiles*

<b>Karl:</b> How we're opposites?  *small shrug*  Just the way we look at some things.  Like patience.

<b>Harry:</b> Go on.  *softly*

<b>Karl:</b> Well...we all know that patience is NOT my strong suit.  *wry smile*  But you...you could wait a thousand years for something and it not bother you.

<b>Harry:</b> That's because I have waited over a thousand years for something.  *fingers brushing over your cheek*  I wasn't born with this patience, epaei.

<b>Karl:</b> Sometimes it seems like you were.

<b>Harry:</b> Ask Daniel sometime.  *smiles*  He knows.

<b>Karl:</b> I'll try to remember that.  *smiles*  I, um...there was a letter from the university when we got home.

<b>Harry:</b> You did?  *stopping again*

<b>Karl:</b> Yeah.  *slow nod, watching you from the corner of my eye*  I found it earlier when I was sorting through all the mail.

<b>Harry:</b> Are you leaving again?  *tight voice*

<b>Karl:</b> No.  *softly, looking down*  Actually...they're offering me a teaching position.

<b>Harry:</b> Here?  *surprised*  In Wellington?

<b>Karl:</b> *nods, sneaking a glance at you*  At the university.  They have a vacant spot in the archaeology department.

<b>Harry:</b> Are you... *fighting for a neutral tone* ...will you take it?

<b>Karl:</b> Depends.  *softly*

<b>Harry:</b> On?

<b>Karl:</b> On whether or not you think you can stand to have me stay home all the time.  *crooked smile*

<b>Harry:</b> *swallows hard, suddenly able to breathe again*  Yeah...I think I'd like that.

<b>Karl:</b> I was hoping you'd say that.  *smiles, stepping close*  Did you really think I was going to leave you, Sin?

<b>Harry:</b> I wasn't sure.  *pulling you into my arms, shuddering as the full weight of emotion sinks into my skin*

<b>Karl:</b> Never leave you.  *arms wrap around your neck, face buried against your chest*

<b>Harry:</b> Okay.  *softly, breath fluttering your hair*

<b>Karl:</b> So, um...suppose it's a bad time to tell you that I went ahead and called them back and told them I'd take the position?  *bites my lip to keep from smiling, not daring to look up at you*

<b>Harry:</b> Well, I dunno, you don't think you should have talked to me about it first?  *fighting to hold back my smile*

<b>Karl:</b> I just did.  *grins, head still down*  And you keep telling me to be my own person and make my own decisions.

<b>Harry:</b> Well, it's a big step... *finally unable to keep still, tilting your head up for a hard, fierce kiss*  Thank you.

<b>Karl:</b> For what?  *blinks, reeling a little from the kiss*

<b>Harry:</b> Taking the job.  *smiles, resuming my way back towards the house*

<b>Karl:</b> Well, I had to do something.  *half smile, walking with you*  The pay's good, and it's just four days a week, so I can still help out at the restaurant.

<b>Harry:</b> I think you'll make a great teacher.  *nods*  You'll love it.

<b>Karl:</b> I think so, too.  They said the students are great in the classes I'll be getting.  Very smart, eager to learn...I'm actually looking forward to it.

<b>Harry:</b> Sounds perfect.  *looking down at our joined hands*  

<b>Karl:</b> *squeezes your fingers*  What're you thinking?

<b>Harry:</b> I've missed this.  *smiles, not looking up*  Just this.

<b>Karl:</b> So have I.  *smiles*

<b>Harry:</b> Love you.  

<b>Karl:</b> Love you, too."

"event","Karl's out on the beach with the kids.  Now that the weather's turned cool, he knows there won't be many opportunities for them to play in the water.  But today has been warmer than usual, so he took pity on them after watching them stare out the window for over two hours.  It seems a sin to keep them cooped up in the house.  So here they are: on the beach, two happy, squeaking kids romping in the water's edge.  Karl thinks that Harry's going to smile when he comes home and hears what they've been doing today.

Harry...  Karl was a little surprised when Harry woke up this morning and stated his intention to go into the restaurant to work today.  Surprised and relieved.  Maybe this means that things are FINALLY getting back to normal.  Or as normal as they can be called around here.  Karl should go in to the restaurant himself.  But he trusts the staff.  He should...he gave most of them his seal of approval when he took over managing the kitchen.  They know their jobs and they do them well.  Perhaps Karl will drop in this weekend, just to see how things are doing.

And he needs to call Bernie.  It was a shock to come home and find that letter from the university waiting.  No, his funding hadn't been cut off.  It was still there if, and when, he decided he wanted to do more field work.  The letter was something entirely different.  The administrators had been looking for someone to fill a vacant slot in the archaelogy department.  Seems they were a professor short.  And they'd looked over Karl's credentials.  Not much teaching experience (okay, well...basically none if Karl was going to be honest with himself), but he had more than enough actual hands on and field work to make up for the lack of in class stuff.  And no one could deny that he knew what he was doing when it came to digging and to ancient civilizations.  Which reminded him...he still wanted to learn the Thracian history from Harry...  But he digressed.  The bottom line is that the administrators have offered him a teaching job.  At the university.  Good pay, light class load that he can pick, intelligent students...and twenty minutes from home.  Karl was thinking very seriously of accepting the offer.  It would be good to stay home and actually DO something worthwhile instead of trotting all over the world and digging in the dirt...taking the job would mean weekends free, staying home all the time, meals in his own kitchen with his mate.  But he wanted to talk it over with Harry first...

Right.  He'd do that over dinner tonight.  But first...

Karl sits on the sand and keeps one eye on the kids.  He's going to again try something that he's been practicing in secret since they returned from Kavala and Paris.  Shapeshifting.  He figures if he can turn into a panther, he should be able to control the shift and turn into something else.  It can't hurt to try anyway.  So he closes his eyes and focuses, keeping one small part of his (what he calls) earth sense on the kids.  He's found he can do that.  Not communicating with them, but he can 'sense' them.  Which is very helpful with the two ferrets.

He sinks into the blue, smiling as the traces of white from Harry's bond wrap around him as well.  What to try today?  Maybe a wolf...nah, too much like Bean.  Which reminds Karl...he needs to call people: Bean, Vig, Ice...Hugo...  Later.

And then he knows.  An eagle.  One of the great big ones, like the ones that live in the western part of the United States.  He fixes the picture in his mind and starts to attempt to harness his powers, meld his body into the shape he can see against the backs of his eyelids.  It would be grand, he thinks, to be able to soar in the clouds..."

"event","<i>Still in Kavala...</i>

Karl sits in the middle of the herb garden, eyes closed, sun warm on his face.  The kids are busy scampering through the fragrant mint, returning every few minutes to check on Karl, and a butterfly is perched lightly in his hair, its wings moving slowly as it just sits there.  But Karl doesn't pay it, or the kids, much mind at the moment.  He told Harry he was going to work on weeding the herbs.  And he did.  Sort of.  It was really just a small matter of persuading the weeds that they didn't really want to grow in amongst the mint and basil and oregano and other such things.  That could be useful in the garden back home.

Home.

Karl smiles.  Maybe, he thinks, just maybe...it's time to start thinking about going home.  They are healing, finally.  They're never going to be like they had been, before Lawrence, but... Karl thinks that they just might end up being better, stronger.  If the last few months had taught him nothing else, it had taught him that he belonged with Harry and that Harry - and what they could build together - was worth fighting for.  And Karl is tired of not fighting for what he wanted.

Fragile wings brush his cheek as the wind stirrs his hair, pushing the butterful closer to his face.  Karl opens his eyes, still smiling, and sees the rose bushes.  As he watches them, the small one - the delicate, yellow blossomed one - stirrs, seeming to stretch up towards the sun, weak branches growing stronger as Karl watches.  Then, one by one, a dozen tiny buds pop out, opening slowly to reveal perfectly formed, fragrant, yellow blooms.  Karl smiles again.  Harry will like those.

Standing, brushing himself off, Karl goes into the house, butterfly still clinging to his hair, kids twining around his ankles with each step.  He no longer thinks about stepping on them.  He won't.  He knows it.  But right now, his thoughts are focused on his bond with Harry.  Slowly, one step at a time, he tracks his mate down, stopping just inside the bedroom.  ""Hey,"" Karl say softly, waiting til Harry looks up from his book.  ""Come outside and look at this..."""

"event","<i>Harry's home...Lawrence is gone....</i>

That refrain had repeated itself in Karl's head repeatedly over the almost three weeks since Harry's return and Lawrence's death.  No matter how he tried to distract himself, the thoughts always returned.  And, with them, the sharp, tearing ache of a lost bond.  Karl knew he'd live with that ache the rest of his life.  The question was, was the rest of his life going to be lived with Harry.

Karl hoped so, but he wasn't sure. They hadn't talked much at all since Harry had returned.  To be honest, Harry had mostly slept and spent a lot of time on the beach, thinking.  Of course, Karl had been doing his own share of thinking.  And, as he wandered outside, moving along the edge of the woods by the house, he thought of something.  And it made him smile a little.

Opening himself to his elemental bond, he let it guide him.  Minutes later, he stopped and looked around.  He was just inside the edge of the woods.  If he moved just a few feet to his left, he could see the house from there.  But he didn't.  Instead, he knelt and bowed his head and sank his fingers into the rich earth beneath him. And nothing happened.

""Damn you,"" Karl whispered, eyes tightly closed, a few tears leaking out.  Then he threw back his head and screamed.  ""Damn you!""

He didn't know who he was damning.  Himself, maybe.  Or Harry.  Or Lawrence.  He didn't know.  But he opened himself fully to the grief and anger and love coursing through him.  Tears streamed down his face and, slowly, his eyes began to glow a soft blue.  And the earth answered.  He barely felt the faint trembling beneath him, or saw the plants that pushed through the soil, their growth accelerated.  He saw none of it.  All he could see was Harry's face, Lawrence's face, the two of them merging and then drifting apart.

He lost all track of time as he knelt there, his elemental bond pulling and shaping the small glade around him.  He might have stayed there much longer if a hand hadn't touched his shoulder, if strong arms hadn't pulled him back against a broad chest.

""Let it go, epaei,"" a familiar, beloved voice whispered in his ear.  ""You're finished.  Look.""

And Karl did look.  He opened his eyes, and, for the first time, saw what he had done.  And he blinked, shocked.  When he had knelt down, it had been in the middle of a small opening in the trees, covered in scrub and scraggly trees.  Now, the opening was a little larger.  Soft, green grass covered the ground, trees towered around it in a broken ring.  Flowers burst in a riot of color, spilling their heady perfume into the air.  Karl sat and stared in awe at the tiny paradise the glade had become.

""I...I did this?""  He whispered, stared.

Harry just nodded.  One arm around Karl, he stretched out his hand towards a large, black rock that had pushed up at one end of the glade.  And the elements answered his summons.  As Karl watched, a damp patch formed in the earth.  Seconds later, a small spring bubbled there.  Lifting his eyes to the rock itself, Karl read the inscription that sheer will had etched there.

<i>E iti noa ana, na te aroha.
Whaia e koe ki te iti kahurangi; ki te tuohu koe, me maunga teitei.</i>

""It's time to go, epaei.""

And Karl let himself be pulled to his feet, led into the house.  And there he was greeted with another shock.  Several suitcases stood by the door.  Karl could see two pairs of beady eyes peering at him through the travel cage that set beside the bags.  He lifted startled eyes to meet Harry's.  ""Harry, what...""

Then Karl saw the two plane tickets Harry held.  And he knew.  They were going to Kavala, to the villa in Greece.  They were going to heal.


<font size=1>[The inscription is Maori. It means ""Though my present be small, my love goes with it. Seek the treasure you value most dearly; if you bow your head, let it be to a lofty mountain.""]</font>"

How many times have I sat out there, in our backyard or on the beach, with Harry, watching the sun set?  I honestly don't know.  I stopped counting years ago.

I can smell the garlic wafting out of the kitchen.  Dinner is ready...it's been ready for a little while now.  Fettucine alfredo and homemade garlic bread.  One of Harry's favorites.  The table is set.  Waiting.  For what, I'm not exactly sure.  I should probably go in there, put the food away.  I'm not really hungry.  And I have a feeling that eating will be the last thing on his mind when he gets home.

<i>I slowly move to the closet, opening it, reaching in.  When I turn back, an old, well cared for, acoustic guitar is in my hand.  The late afternoon sun gleams off the warm honey of the wood, polished by years of use.  It's been a long time since I thought about this.  Even longer since I touched it.  But maybe now is a good time to start again.  The gentle breeze tugs at my hair as I walk back into the backyard and settle in the grass, the kids immediately scampering over to play around my feet.

<i>Vincent and Hugo should be in Bulgaria by now.  And all I can do is stay here and pray that nothing goes wrong, that they return quickly with Vincent's body.  They have to...and what we're planning has to work.  It has to.  If it doesn't...  No.  I'm not going to think about that right now.  Right now, I'm going to think about dinner.

It's ironic, in a way, how closely Lawrence's kitchen resembles mine.  I never noticed it before.  But now, having been here a few days, the similarity is amazing.  I barely have to look for anything.  It's reassuring, almost.  Plus it keeps me from having to keep a constant eye on the kids as they weave in and out around my ankles while I work.  Cheeky little buggers...I spoil them too much.  But Harry spoiled them more....

Stop it, Karl.

It's been so long since I cooked a dinner for two that didn't include Harry.  For three or four or more, yes.  But for two?  Close to seven years since I've shared a nice, quiet dinner at home with anyone other than him.  And now, I'm preparing to do that with Lawrence.  Hopefully, he'll be home by the time I'm done making the pasta.  Everything else is ready to go.

Fuck.

ImmortalSinclair: Karl?  *dropping my keys on the table, glancing in the living room, not seeing you*

WereKarl: In here.  *calls softly, intent on putting the groceries away, pulling produce from a bag and turning towards the fridge*

ImmortalSinclair: *walking into the kitchen, leaning against the door, watching you*  Went shopping?

WereKarl: Yeah.  *glances up, smiling a little*  We needed some things, and I thought...it might do me some good to get out of the house instead of having it delivered like usual.

ImmortalSinclair: I didn't mean to be at the shop so long or I'd have gone with you.  *smiling back, still watching you, so happy to have you back in the kitchen, in the house*

WereKarl: It's okay.  *finishes putting the produce away, moving to pull cans and bottles from another bag*  You'd have been bored.

ImmortalSinclair: Actually, shopping with you is quite the experience.  *grinning*  Everyone at the market is terrified of you.

WereKarl: *looks up at you, startled*  They are?

ImmortalSinclair: In a very good way.  *shrugging slightly*  They know not to cheat you.

WereKarl: *smiles*  Can't help it if I know quality from trash.

ImmortalSinclair: That's what I told them.  *catching your arm on your next pass, pulling you into my arms*  You know, it occurs to me that you have yet to give me a proper hello.  *teasing, hands running just under your shirt, across your lower back*

WereKarl: No, I haven't, have I?  *murmurs, lashes lowering as I drape my arms over your shoulders*  How about I fix that?  *presses against you, lips touching yours lightly in a teasing kiss*

ImmortalSinclair: What a splendid idea.  *murmuring against your lips, following your tongue, curling my own around it, lips pressing against yours*

WereKarl: *slides my tongue along yours, deepening the kiss, one hand tangling in your hair as I let myself drift, content to stand here for the moment, trading slow kisses with you*

ImmortalSinclair: *finally pulling back, licking my lips*  Much better.  Now I feel like I'm home.

WereKarl: So do I.  *softly, brushing your cheek with the back of my fingers*

ImmortalSinclair: *another slow kiss, tongue sweeping along your teeth*  I should let you get back to the groceries.  *reluctantly pulling away, hands smoothing your shirt down*

WereKarl: There's only one bag left.  *glances towards where it sits on the counter, trying to hide my disappointment*  Mostly boxed stuff...noodles, cereal.

ImmortalSinclair: Stuff that can wait, then?  *following your gaze*

WereKarl: Yeah.  *nods, taking a step towards the bag*  All the cold stuff is already up.

ImmortalSinclair: Well, that changes things.  *turning you around swiftly, backing you into the counter, already reaching for your zipper, lips fastened to your neck, nibbling and biting along soft skin*

WereKarl: *gasps, head falling back to give you better access, hands gripping your upper arms tightly, the edge of the counter pressing into my lower back as I buck against your hand*  Harry...

ImmortalSinclair: Shhh...let me...*fisting you in quick movements, licking my way up your neck, capturing your moan with my mouth*

WereKarl: *surrenders as your tongue plunders my mouth, unable to stop my hips from thrusting into the warmth and friction of your fist, body trembling beneath your sudden assault*

ImmortalSinclair: *wrist flicking, gripping you tighter, hot flesh gliding along my palm, slick and full, pushing against your hips, my tongue micmicking the movements inside your mouth, trading wet kisses*

WereKarl: *moans are continuous, body arching against you, fire licking along my nerve endings, crying out softly as your wrist twists a certain way and I come hard, the counter and your arm the only things holding me up as my knees buckle*

ImmortalSinclair: *kissing you slow, deep, drawing out every moan, hand slowing, then stilling, watching you with a small smile as i lift my hand and lick my fingers clean*

WereKarl: *watches you, trembling as I reach out to pull you close, tongue sliding over your lower lip before dipping inside your mouth, tasting myself, smoky and dark, on your tongue as my hand reaches for your zipper*

ImmortalSinclair: You don't have to... *moaning against your lips, involuntarily bucking against your hand*

WereKarl: *stops, hesitant, eyes searching yours*  Do you want me to?  *softly, pressing a small kiss against the corner of your mouth*

ImmortalSinclair: Don't want you to feel obligated.  *turning my head to press my lips to yours*

WereKarl: I like making you feel good.  *very softly, glancing down, hand cupping you through your jeans*

ImmortalSinclair: *groans, biting my lip, gaze following yours, cock jumping under your hand*  Been awhile...

WereKarl: Since?  *eyes lifting to meet yours, gently squeezing you through the heavy denim*

ImmortalSinclair: Done...touched...*forehead falling against yours, breath shallow, fingers digging into your hips*

WereKarl: Then let me.  *whispers, kissing you deeply as my fingers nimbly undo your jeans and slip inside to pull you free, stroking as I fall to my knees and take you deep into my throat, sucking with hollowed cheeks, tongue sliding along your length as I move*

ImmortalSinclair: Oh Jesus...fuck...*hands tangling in your hair, thrusting deep in your throat, wet tongue gliding along the underside of my cock, and fuck you feel so good, feels like forever since you've touched me, since i've felt you, all slippery and tight on me*

WereKarl: *relaxes my throat, taking you deeper, humming softly, hands on your hips to steady you as I lose myself in the flavor and texture of you, all senses focused on you, on making this good for you*

ImmortalSinclair: *thrusting faster, body tensing, cock twitching, balls tightening to the point of pain--and you take me in that much deeper, cheeks that much tighter, and i bite my tongue hard enough to draw blood when i come in hot, thick spurts down your throat, black spots dancing behind my eyes at the intensity*

WereKarl: *moans softly as the thick, musky taste of you fills me, swallowing it all, moving slower now, tongue lazy on you, drawing it out, then licking you clean before sliding back up your body to kiss you softly*

ImmortalSinclair: *still shuddering, shaking into your kiss, hands still fisted in your hair, breath harsh, unsteady*

WereKarl: Shhh...  *murmurs against your lips, hands stroking your back, soothing your shudders, pressing against you so you can feel me*

ImmortalSinclair: Love you.  *clutching you tight, trying to ease down, breathing deeply*

WereKarl: I love you.  *smiles, looking into your eyes, calm, content, happy to be here, with you*

ImmortalSinclair: Sorry I, uh...*vague gesture*  Been awhile.  *smiling back at you sheepishly*

WereKarl: Awhile?  *blinks, looking at you, unsure what you mean since it's hardly in your nature to abstain*  Didn't you...  *trails off when you shake your head*  You didn't?

ImmortalSinclair: Didn't want to.  *slight shrug*  Didn't seem...right.  *smoothing your hair back*  Only wanted your hands on me.

WereKarl: But...I wasn't here.  *voice is barely audible and I stare at you, stunned that you would do this*

ImmortalSinclair: Which is why it's been awhile.  *fingers trailling along your neck*

WereKarl: Oh, Harry...  *shaky voice, cupping your face in my hands, leaning in to kiss you softly*  You didn't have to wait.

ImmortalSinclair: Wanted to...*mumbles against your lips*

WereKarl: Why?  *pulling back a little, eyes searching yours, thumbs stroking over your cheekbones*

ImmortalSinclair: *looking back, leaning into your touch*  If we're going to do this, we should do it right.  Be totally in tune with each other.

WereKarl: And that means no touching yourself when I'm not around?  *smiles a little, hands sliding down your arms to lace our fingers together*

ImmortalSinclair: Not until I got you back from the clinic, no.  *kissing our joined fingers*

WereKarl: Well, I'm here now.  *presses my forehead against yours, lips touching our joined fingers*

ImmortalSinclair: Yes, you are.  *softly*  

WereKarl: And I'm not leaving again.  *just as softly, eyes intent, locked with yours*

ImmortalSinclair: Not without me, you're not.  *squeezing your fingers*  Never again.

WereKarl: Means you can live in a tent with me if I dig again.  *smiles, then grows serious once more*  We're in this together, aren't we, Harry?

ImmortalSinclair: That's the idea, yeah.  You and me.  *small smile*  An eternity in your arms, with you by my side.

WereKarl: Can't think of anything I'd like more.  *pushes against you, moving you back towards the living room*  I'm rather fond of the idea of waking up in your arms every morning for the rest of forever.

ImmortalSinclair: It's a good goal...*backing up through the door, finally tumbling down on the sofa, pulling you with me*

WereKarl: Yes, it is.  *smiles, curling around you*  This morning was a good start.

ImmortalSinclair: And tomorrow morning will be another one.  *wrapping my arms around you*  

WereKarl: *nods, curling tight against you, head on your shoulder*  I think...maybe...we'll be okay as long as we remember to live one day at a time, and deal with everything together.

ImmortalSinclair: I think it's the only way we're going to be okay.  *kissing your hair*  Partners.  We need to remember that.

WereKarl: I want us to be okay.  *quietly*  The idea of losing you...  *shudders, closing my eyes tight*

ImmortalSinclair: *resting my cheek on your hair*  Karl, I've *already* lost you in this life.  We lost each other.  I'm not doing it again.

WereKarl: Neither am I.  I'll die first.  *lies quietly for a moment, then opens my eyes, lifting my head to look at you*  What we had was good...and I want it back, damn it.

ImmortalSinclair: Why don't we shoot for something better, hmm?  *kissing you quickly, hands roaming along your back*  I don't want to live in the past with you.  I want the future, complete with all of our mistakes.

WereKarl: I want that, too.  *smiling a little, letting my head rest on your shoulder again*  But I also want to understand my past...not live in it, just understand it.

ImmortalSinclair: So, tell me what it would take to help you understand it.

WereKarl: I don't know.  Wish I did.  *small shrug, fingers trailing back and forth over your ribs*  Maybe being able to consciously pull up the memories and personalities, all of them, and sort through them.

ImmortalSinclair: Are you sure that's what you want to do?  *sighing a little under your touch, brushing my lips over your hair*

WereKarl: Well...  *pauses, glancing up at you*  Do you think it's a bad idea?

ImmortalSinclair: It's a lot of memories, love.  A lot to handle.  I'm just...worried.

WereKarl: I can work on it slowly...or not at all.  Not if it's going to cause problems.  *chews my bottom lip, hesitating*  Maybe there's something Vig could do to block them...

ImmortalSinclair: I think slowly might be a good idea.  *kissing your forehead*  Perhaps one life at a time.

WereKarl: *faint smile*  Wasn't planning on tackling all 17 at one time.

ImmortalSinclair: Seemed like you were there for awhile.

WereKarl: *shifts a little so I can see your face*  How so?

ImmortalSinclair: Well, I have to wonder what you were trying to achieve when you were seeking the memories on your own.  *looking at you*

WereKarl: I was...just...  *stops and looks away, voice softening*  Trying to get a better understanding of you, I guess.

ImmortalSinclair: Of me?  *placing my hand on your cheek, turning you back to face me*  How?

WereKarl: *shrugs, looking in your eyes*  You were so happy with some of them.  I just thought that if I could remember how you were with each of them, I might could figure out what was wrong with us.

ImmortalSinclair: *soft smile*  *We* are what's wrong with us, not them.  We forgot how to listen to each other.

WereKarl: I know that now.  *softly, trying to smile*  Then...I wasn't so sure.

ImmortalSinclair: I still want your word that you'll never try something like that again.  *serious expression*  I don't know that I could pull you back a second time.

WereKarl: I told you I wouldn't try that again without you nearby.  *looks at you, then sighs softly*  I promise, Harry.

ImmortalSinclair: Thank you.  *kissing you softly, relieved*

WereKarl: *faint smile*  I'm way too scared of pulling up Gaol again to do it on my own anymore.

ImmortalSinclair: As well you should be.  *doesn't smile back*  He wasn't going quietly.

WereKarl: No, he wasn't.  And he could have killed you.  *quietly, looking down*

ImmortalSinclair: Only if I allowed it.  *quietly*  I knew the risk.  It was acceptable.

WereKarl: *frowns a little*  You gave him permission, Harry.  And you weren't fighting him.

ImmortalSinclair: He wasn't going to do it.  *gazing at you*  I knew he couldn't.  No matter what else we are, we were too closely bound to each other.  He could no more kill me than I could him.

WereKarl: *shakes my head, looking at you*  Harry, you don't understand...if you had tried to fight back, he was determined to kill you.

ImmortalSinclair: Precisely why I didn't.  *cupping your chin gently*  I *know* him, love.  

WereKarl: I suppose you do.  *softly, smiling a little*  I really am sorry about that.  *my fingers trail over your throat, touching where the bruises marred your skin*

ImmortalSinclair: Gaol should be apologizing, not you.  *bending my head to kiss your fingers*  

WereKarl: I'm sorry for letting him in long enough to do that.  *serious expression, but my eyes are twinkling*  Though I'm sure I could bring him back if you really want to try to get an apology out of him....

ImmortalSinclair: *slight laugh*  I spent the better part of a decade trying to get one out of him.  I sincerely doubt time has mellowed him at all.  

WereKarl: No, I'd say it definitely hasn't.  *smiles and curls back in to you, tucking my head beneath your chin*  So...care to tell me what the episode in the kitchen was all about?

ImmortalSinclair: What epi...you mean just now?

WereKarl: Yeah, just now.

ImmortalSinclair: What about it?  *confused*

WereKarl: Just wondering.  *small shrug*  You said you didn't do anything while I was gone, and you haven't touched me since I came home, and then...

ImmortalSinclair: I was waiting.  *smoothing your hair back*

WereKarl: Waiting for what?

ImmortalSinclair: For you.

WereKarl: Been home for a couple days now, Sin.  *reminds you softly, arm wrapping securely around your waist*

ImmortalSinclair: Yes, but you haven't seemed...*pause, massaging your lower back again*...receptive.  Today was the first hint I got that you were ready to resume that part of our relationship.

WereKarl: I haven't...  *stops, then flushes slightly*  No, I suppose I haven't.  I'm sorry.

ImmortalSinclair: For what?  *kissing your cheek*  This isn't a test, epaei.  

WereKarl: No, I know.  *smiles a little, watching my fingers as they play in the ends of your hair*  You know I've never said no to that part of our relationship.

ImmortalSinclair: This wasn't about not saying no.  *shifting to allow you more access*  It was about you *wanting* me.

WereKarl: I did want you.  *softly, lifting my head to look at you*  I /do/ want you.  I...thought, maybe, you didn't want me.

ImmortalSinclair: What in our history would *ever* make you think that I wouldn't want you?  *softly, hand trailing over soft skin*  My ache for you is constant.

WereKarl: *shifts a little, uncomfortable, glancing down*  You didn't kiss me.  You brought the kids to see me...brought me home...pulled the drugs out of my system...but not even one kiss.

ImmortalSinclair: You weren't... *sighs, wondering if I'll ever reach the point where I do something right around you again*  Karl, you weren't you.  It would have been like...*struggling for words*...kissing a stranger in your body.

WereKarl: Oh.  *softly*  I didn't realize...

ImmortalSinclair: I never meant to make you feel unwanted.  *kissing your chin, tongue licking along the slight stubble*  Ever.

WereKarl: No, that was my mistake.  *closing my eyes and unconsciously tilting my head back*  If I'd thought for a minute, I'd have known.

ImmortalSinclair: I always want you.  *breathing the words along your jawline, placing tiny kisses on your neck*

WereKarl: *smiles, fingers sliding up your spine*  And I always want you.

ImmortalSinclair: No more talk of not wanting, then.  *smiling against your lips*

WereKarl: No, no more.  *kisses you softly*  Have I told you how glad I am that you rescued me from the clinic?

ImmortalSinclair: No, I don't believe you have.  *smoothing your hair back, tangling fingers in the silky slide*  

WereKarl: I am.  *quietly, pulling back just enough to see you clearly, nudging your hand with my head when you stop*  When I think about how that could have ended up...  *shudders*

ImmortalSinclair: *continues to massage your scalp, can practically feel you purring*  You were doing what you thought was best at the time, love.  I'm only sorry it took me as long as it did to come after you.

WereKarl: *closes my eyes and smiles, wiggling a little against you, relaxing under the heavenly feeling of your fingers*  Why did it take you so long?

ImmortalSinclair: You left me, remember?  *softly*  I was giving you the time I thought you wanted.

WereKarl: *slowly opens my eyes, smile fading a little*  Oh...so what made you change your mind?

ImmortalSinclair: The house was too empty without you.  *simply, the tips of my fingers trailing along your hair*

WereKarl: Well, I'm glad you came after me.  *very quietly*  That place...it wouldn't have helped me.  Probably the worst idea I've had in ages...even more so than trying to leave you to make you happy.

ImmortalSinclair: We all have our moments.  *smiling softly at you*  It's past.

WereKarl: Yes, it is.  Past and soon to be forgotten.  *smiles back, fingers tracing your cheekbones*  All the help I need is right here.

ImmortalSinclair: I don't want to forget.  *licking along your fingers*  Just to learn from our mistakes.  

WereKarl: We've made a lot of them.  *watching you, hands held still, smiling as your tongue slides over my fingers*  Tickles.

ImmortalSinclair: Sorry.  *small smile, placing a last kiss on each of your fingers*  Then we have much to learn.

WereKarl: No, it's okay.  I kinda liked it.  *smiles brightly, tracing your bottom lip with a finger*  And yes, we do.  Most important is how to live together again.

ImmortalSinclair: Any ideas?  *nipping at your finger*

WereKarl: Talk more.  About everything, even the stuff we think is trivial.  *taps your bottom lip, grinning when you nip at my finger again*  Listen to each other...don't take no for an answer.  I...if I can learn to live with you again, I can live with myself.  *soft, serious voice, eyes locked with yours*  You give me the balance I need to stay away from the lithium and other drugs.

ImmortalSinclair: I like the sound of that.  Balancing each other. *tugging you forward for a slow kiss, humming in quiet satisfaction when you open your mouth for me*

WereKarl: *relaxes into the kiss to begin with, content to melt against you, let you take control*  *suddenly presses against you, hands tangling in your hair, a little more aggressive as my tongue slides over yours*

ImmortalSinclair: *sinking into the cushions, fists tightening in your hair, tongue sliding against yours, your weight on me a welcome one*

WereKarl: *pushing against you until you're fully reclined, shifting to straddle your hips, chests pressed together, slowly ending the kiss and smiling down at you*  Hey, you.

ImmortalSinclair: Hey you.  *smoothing my hands along your shoulders, down your arms, finally placing my hands over yours, linking our fingers together*  

WereKarl: You should fire that idiot lawyer.  *leans down for a brief kiss, squeezing your fingers*

ImmortalSinclair: Which one?  

WereKarl: The one that told me that that clinic and that doctor were the best things for me.  *soft snort, frowning a little*

ImmortalSinclair: And which one is that?  *softly*

WereKarl: The blond one.  Younger than the others.  *shakes head*  He was pretty excited about me going there.

ImmortalSinclair: I'll talk care of it.  *mildly, but i'm seething inside...*  Opesdol vakim...*under my breath*

WereKarl: *eyes you, faintly concerned*  What was that?

ImmortalSinclair: Hmmm...oh, nothing.  *smoothing the wrinkle between your brows*  I'll have a talk with him tomorrow.

WereKarl: Harry...  *stops, shaking my head*  I'm sure he meant well.  He was certainly eager enough.

ImmortalSinclair: I'm sure he did.  *gently*  No bloodshed, I promise.  *There may not be enough of him left *to* bleed*

WereKarl: *eyes you for a moment longer, then nods slowly*  I suppose I'll have to accept that.

ImmortalSinclair: How are you feeling, anyway?  Any side effects?

WereKarl: Nope, none at all.  *smiles*  Think we pretty much proved a little while ago that the last residual traces are out of my system.  *sits up, hands resting lightly on your chest, looking down at you sprawled on the sofa*  And I feel fine.

ImmortalSinclair: Do you?  *smoothing my hands up under your shirt*

WereKarl: *nods, still smiling*  Yes, I do.  Feel good, actually.  Better than I have in a while.

ImmortalSinclair: That's great.  *rubbing along the hairs on your stomach*  

WereKarl: And why's that?  *fingers toying with the top button of your shirt, slowly slipping it free*

ImmortalSinclair: Missed you.  *pulling up your shirt, tugging it over your head*

WereKarl: I missed you, too.  *shaking my head to settle my hair around my shoulders, not bothering to look for where you tossed my shirt*  But what's that got to do with how I feel?

ImmortalSinclair: No, I missed *you*.  *quietly, running my palms along your chest*

WereKarl: *smiles, back arching a little, shivering a bit as your hands seek out sensitive spots*  Well, I'm here now.

ImmortalSinclair: So you are.  *sliding my hands along your shoulders, pulling you back down for a thorough kiss*

WereKarl: *weight resting on my elbows as we trade lazy, open mouthed kisses, your hands warm on my back, my fingers sliding through your hair*"

"event","I'm home again. For good this time. The only way I'll leave again is if Harry goes. No more running, no more avoiding, no more distance. We're in this together. We either make it work...or we don't. And in that case...well...there are places in the world I'd like to visit, places with no memories attached.

Harry's still sleeping...all the drugs they pumped into me in the few days I was in that place knocked him out. Can't blame him...god knows they certainly kept me mostly comatose.  And he cleansed my blood too fast...said so himself.  But he'll wake soon.  And when he does...we talk. Honestly this time. No holding anything back...or evading...or lying. I suppose this is our last stand...the final trench is dug, our backs are to the ocean, and we have everything to lose. We have to make it work...we *will* make it work. I won't accept anything less. And if that means giving up certains dreams I had...so be it. He - and our relationship - is what's most important. We'll find a way, find a compromise.

We'll take it one day at a time, one thing at a time. We've got too much heartache and grief between us to fix it overnight. But we can fix it. I believe that. I have to believe that. Or I have nothing left to believe in. There's so much that went wrong, so many little things that should have never gotten as big as they did...

Nicholas, my curse, Marton, Ice, my wanting a child, Harry's open disapproval of things I did, my jealousy and insecurity...all things that could have been dealt with, could have been worked out. But we didn't. Instead, we chose to avoid, chose to let them fester, to eat away at us until they exploded. But no more.

The hospital...the time away from Harry...made me realize what I want. And what I want is him. And what we had. And I'll be damned if I give up without a fight. He bound us together.  Now he's stuck with me.  Orokre...forever.  Like it or not.  I don't want what we have...I want what we had...and I'm willing to fight for it until I have nothing left to fight with. I can only hope he is, as well....because I can't do it alone."

"event","<i>The beach is beautiful at night.  The moon - full tonight - paints the water ebony, the sand silver, and a soft breeze is blowing in from over the ocean.  I breathe deeply, the smell of salt and sand filling my lungs, relaxing me.  A sense of peace washes over me, and I'm content for the first time in a very long time.  I've been discontent.  I don't know why...I don't even remember being discontent.  But I have been.

A quiet sound to my left draws my attention, so I glance over.  And smile.  Marton.  I'm not surprised that he's here, tonight, on this deserted stretch of beach.  What surprises me is that Harry's not with him.  The two are always together...so beautiful the way they move around each other, with each other.  I often wonder if they know of my jealousy, my desire.  Sometimes, I think they might.  Sometimes, one or the other will glance at me, and I can see the knowledge in their eyes.

Marton walks towards me, smiling, one hand lifting towards me.  But I'm no longer looking at him.  A shadow behind him has drawn my gaze.  I stare at it, stare into its blackness, shivering a little at the menace rolling off of it.  I try to call out, try to warn Marton - so oblivious to it as he approaches me - but I can't speak.  My voice is silent, locked inside me, and all I can do is watch.  Watch as a flash of silver lances from the shadow, spearing into Marton, bringing him to his knees with a harsh cry.

All I can do is watch in horror as a figure emerges from the shadow.  It's Harry...no.  Not Harry.  Someone else.  Someone who resembles Harry...someone...I know that face.  I know it.  But why can't I...place...Nicholas.  It must be.  No one else could look that much like Harry and not *be* Harry.

I'm frozen, watching as the features seem to shift, hair and skin darkening, taking on a familiar cast that I can't place.  But, again, I know that face.  I know it, and all I can do is sit here and watch as this person kills Marton.  And then Harry is there, coming out of nowhere to defend the person attacking his lover.  This isn't happening.  It can't be.  But it is.

Another flash of silver, and Harry screams.  Everything is happening so fast, flicker motions.  Marton, fallen on the sand.  Harry, doubled over, clutching himself.  And the figure, standing triumphant, sharp blade clutched tightly in one hand, rosary hanging from the other, dark laughter ringing across the water...and crimson splattering everything in sight....</i>

I sit up in bed, gasping as I bite back a scream, body bathed in cold sweat.  I turn, reach for Harry...but he's not here...."

"event","<i>I thought Italy had healed whatever was wrong with us.  Or started to heal it.  And that my confessions over Marton had moved us a lot closer to where we should be.  I was wrong.  Once again, my pride and immaturity - and his arrogance and stubbornness - have gotten in the way.  I'm starting to wonder if we *can* be truly happy again.  Forever's a pretty long time to be this miserable.

It's no longer even about the baby.  Not like that's going to happen anyway, not now, not anytime soon...possibly not ever.  And the sad thing is...I'm actually okay with that.  Can't believe I was ever naive enough to think that a child would cure our problems...or that I was stupid enough to want to bring a child into this, as Harry called it, fucked up situation.  So I may never have a child of my own.  That's okay.  I have memories of 29 wonderful, beautiful, perfect children.  And they <b>were</b> mine, in spirit if nothing else.

The fight last night...should have never happened.  I know that.  Hell, I knew it at the time.  But I couldn't keep my mouth shut.  He got a little short because I didn't want to talk and, well...I lashed out.  Typical of us these days.  One says something in just the slightest wrong way and tempers flare out of control.  I didn't want to fight.  That was the very last thing I wanted.  No, I wanted to be with him, have him be there for me, to comfort me when my heart was shattering over Ice and all the possibilities that will never happen.  He didn't.  And that's my fault.  I pushed him away.  Like always.

So now, here I am once again, curled up in bed where I've been all day.  The world is locked outside, the curtains are pulled tight, the kids are curled up on the bed beside me, asleep after their late afternoon romp.  No going outside for them today.  The sunshine and soft breeze are just too painful right now.  I know I shouldn't do this.  But I can't resist.  Depression is as much a part of me as the disease that I fight every single time I put food in my mouth.  It's something I've learned to live with...just...sometimes...it overwhelms me, drags me under, threatens to drown me.  And still, after six years, I've never once told Harry.  Telling him about the diabetes was hard enough.  How do you tell your lover - the man you love beyond all else, a man practically a god in his own right - that you're manic?  You don't.

I should probably get up now, fix dinner.  But what's the use?  I'm not hungry, and Harry's not here.  He didn't come home last night.  I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't come home tonight, either.  If he does, well...I'll get up and throw something together then.  If not...there's always tomorrow...</i>

I don't wanna lose you,
I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry
That don't really matter to anyone, anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

Now I could never change you
I don't wanna blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
Do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Cause, baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough"

"event","<i>Once again, I sit here in the middle of the basement floor, body covered in sweat from the workout I just gave myself, fists throbbing from the blows I delivered to the punching bag.  The lotus position comes so easily to me now, without thought.  I settle into it and close my eyes.  And this - this centering and finding of myself - is even easier.  Like slipping into an old, comfortable coat.  Only not.

My mind drifts, calm, relaxed.  I allow myself a few minutes of peaceful solitude before I start to focus, diving inward, going deeper, looking for the core of who I am, the core of the memories that I still can't unlock. It's frustrating...beyond frustrating, really, knowing that they're there but I can't get to them. So I'll try again.

But first, the curse. It's glowing a little brighter tonight, a little more blue tinge in it. It pulses softly as I study it, but it's a quiet pulse.  Not the angry, trying to get out pulse of just a few weeks ago. I wonder at that, wonder what's causing it...wonder if perhaps it's just the calm before the storm.  And...odd.  It seems to be closer to the memory core now.  Maybe I shouldn't be doing this when I'm tired.  I think it fucks up my perception a little...but I have to.  I have to know.

And there are the memories, still bundled tightly together, still not willing to give up their secrets without a fight.  But I need those memories.  I need them to understand who I am, who I was...to understand Harry.  And Marton.  All of it.  So I settle down, intent on prying something loose tonight.  But they're stubborn, resisting my every attempt.  Then suddenly one snaps free, whipping out to ensnare me before I can react.  It swallows me, holding me tight as images flood my mind of war and death and bitter hatred mixed with love.  This is...</i>

"event","<i>I shouldn't be doing this.  I know I shouldn't.  But I'm going to do it.  It's like an addiction.

And the best place is the workout room in the basement.  So here I sit, lotus position, in the middle of the floor.  The kids are curled up, asleep, in front of me, so I know they won't disturb my concentration.  And Harry's at the restaurant.  Or off talking to Ice...or Hugo...or god knows where.  But he's not home, and I don't expect him back any time soon.  Probably just as well.  Now...

Using the tricks that Hugo taught me, I close my eyes and sink into myself, centering, focusing.  And there I am...I can 'see' myself.  And the curse.  It's got a faint blue-ish cast to it now, overwrapped as it with layers of energy.  No longer black.  And it's quiet.  I wonder what that means.  But that's not for now.  Now, I have other things I need to do.  So I focus further inward, sinking deeper into my mind, looking for the core of my memories, of their memories...

And there they are.  Right there.  I circle them, poking at the edges, not looking for any one memory or personality in particular.  Just looking.  Richard, Diana, Lenore, Charlotte, Helen, Daniel, Emily, Stacy, Natasha, Margaret, Sam, Annabelle, Gaol, Ava, Leon, Valencia, Mike....they're all here.  If I could just sort them out, organize them.  If I could only call them up at will instead of always standing on the outside looking in...if only.

A little more poking - just a touch - and suddenly a set of memories detaches and races towards me.  I barely have time to register it before I'm sucked in.  And suddenly everything is calm.  Lenore...the malaria victim...so much sadness there at the end, knowing I'm dying...</i>"

<font size=1>[private convo]</font>

WereKarl: Pull off here.  *gestures towards the side of the road, eyes finding the landmark that the girl at the front desk told me about, twisting to pull a blanket from the backseat*

ImmortalSinclair: Alright.  *pulling over and stopping the car, admiring the breathtaking scenery*  Wow.  *grinning at you, getting out and grabbing the picnic basket*

WereKarl: *grins as I get out of the car*  Yeah, the girl at the desk told me about it.  Said it was perfect for a romantic picnic.

ImmortalSinclair: I'd say she knew what she was talking about.  *taking your hand as we walk away from the car*  Your day, you pick the spot.

WereKarl: Mmm...I dunno.  *walks slowly through the field, moving towards the trees a few hundred feet away*  *reaches one that towers over us, spreading branches providing shade from the bright sun*  Here's good.

ImmortalSinclair: Yeah, I like it.  *setting the basket down, helping you spread the blanket on the ground, then pouncing on you, rolling you on your back, grinning as i look down at you*  And I like this even better.

WereKarl: *grins up at you, not trying to move, pleased that you seem to be enjoying this idea*  You do, huh?

ImmortalSinclair: Hmmm...let's see.  I've got a basket full of food, a blanket, a deserted spot, and a very gorgeous man underneath me who so *happens* to have a tongue stud and knows how to use it.  *grinning*  I'd say life couldn't get much better.

WereKarl: Ah, I see.  *nodding, trying to look sad*  You're just interested in me for this.  *pokes tongue out, trying not to laugh when your eyes focus immediately on the pearl*

ImmortalSinclair: Not *just* that.  *can't resist sliding my tongue briefly along yours*  After all, you just got it.

WereKarl: Good point.  *smiles, wiggling a bit until I'm comfortable*  If I didn't know better, though, I'd say you were very happy I got it.

ImmortalSinclair: Eh, it's alright.  *tries to look innocent*

WereKarl: *snorts*  You need to work on that, Sin.  You look like you're in pain.

ImmortalSinclair: *laughing, pulling you into a sitting position*  I never claimed to be good at everthing.

WereKarl: It's a good thing.  *lets you pull me up, then uses my forward momentum to push you over, sprawling on top of you*  Well...now this is interesting...

ImmortalSinclair: Is it now?  *comfortably spraweld underneath you, hands automatically going to your hips*

WereKarl: Mmhmm...  *smiles, leaning down for a slow, wet kiss*  Very interesting.  *murmurs*  You hungry?

ImmortalSinclair: Is this a trick question?  *licking my lips*

WereKarl: *shifts to get comfortable, pulling my knees up, straddling your hips, grinning*  Nope, not at all.

ImmortalSinclair: Then yes, I am.  *tugging your head down for another thorough kiss*

WereKarl: *kisses you back, tongue sliding over yours, fingers combing through your hair, lightly grinding my hips against you*  So...  *whispers against your lips*  ...what would you like to start with?

ImmortalSinclair: I get a choice?  *hands worming under your shirt, sliding along the bare skin of your back*

WereKarl: There's always a choice, love.  *another soft kiss before pushing up, hands braced beside your head, looking down at you*

ImmortalSinclair: Then I want you to pick.  *squeezing your hip with gentle fingers*

WereKarl: *smiles*  You do, do you?  *slides off you, reaching for the basket*  Well, let's see what we've got here then.

ImmortalSinclair: *sitting up, crossing my legs as i watch you, smiling when dapples of sunlight reflect off your hair and skin*

WereKarl: Grapes.  *holds up a bunch of them, grinning at you, hair falling over my forehead as I set them aside and dive back into the basket, pulling out more fruit, sandwiches, antipasto, and a large thermos*

ImmortalSinclair: Um...we planning on staying out here all week?  *brushing your hair back behind your ear, my touch lingering*  Cause I think we've got enough food for it.

WereKarl: *looks up at you, smiling a little*  Well...I thought we could take our time...spend the afternoon out here...but if you don't want to...

ImmortalSinclair: No, I don't mind at all. *smiling*

WereKarl: Okay, well...  *peers back in the basket, then sets it aside*  That's it.  So, um, I guess we can eat.

ImmortalSinclair: You nervous about something?  *eyeing you*  Seem a bit on edge.

WereKarl: No, I'm fine.  *smiles, unwrapping a sandwich and handing it to you, then unwrapping one for myself*  Notice there aren't any sweets here.

ImmortalSinclair: Yeah, I did.  *taking my sandwich, still looking at you*  Decided to give them up?

WereKarl: No, just...  *shrugs, taking a bite of my sandwich and chewing slowly before answering*  Figured it was safer to not tempt myself.

ImmortalSinclair: When have you ever been safe?  *smiling at you, taking a bite and making a soft noise of approval--fuck, but i love the food here*

WereKarl: True.  *nibbling at the edge of my sandwich, staring across the field*  With this, though...thought I might give it a try.  Since I'm going to be around a while, and all.

ImmortalSinclair: Good to know that you're coming to terms with that.

WereKarl: With being immortal?  *glances at you as I open the thermos*

ImmortalSinclair: Yeah.  You've been pretty freaked out about that.  *another bite, savoring the sharp flavors on my tongue*

WereKarl: It's not exactly something I ever expected to happen.  Took a while to get used to it...to knowing that everyone I grew up with, family, all of them, will grow old and die, and I won't.  *softly, holding the thermos in my lap, staring at it but not really seeing it*

ImmortalSinclair: You still haven't told your parents, have you?  *softly, placing my hand over yours*

WereKarl: What am I supposed to tell them?  *looks up at you, hand twisting to clutch at yours*

ImmortalSinclair: The truth, I would imagine.  *lacing our fingers together*  They seem to have accepted me.

WereKarl: You're not their son.  *quietly, eyes never leaving yours*  And it took me two years to figure out how to tell them about you.

ImmortalSinclair: Yes, but I'm the one you'll be spending eternity with.  That should provide them with some comfort.  *thumb stroking your hand*  They both know how I feel about you.

WereKarl: Yeah.  *faint smile, looking down at our joined hands*  My mom actually asked once if we were going to get married.

ImmortalSinclair: Did she?  *smiling*  What'd you tell her?

WereKarl: I told her not anytime in the near future.  *soft laugh as I remember her next words*  She said it was a shame that you weren't a woman because we could have had beautiful children.  She's a little biased.

ImmortalSinclair: She loves you.  That's how mothers are.  *glancing down at the blanket, focusing on the blue and white pattern...and my next words are low, almost whispered*  You really want to do this, don't you?

WereKarl: *looks at you for a moment, not quite sure I heard you correctly*  I wanted to, yeah.  *picks up a fork and pokes through the antipasto, spearing some cheese*

ImmortalSinclair: And now?

WereKarl: Now?  *shrugs, popping the bite of cheese into my mouth, chewing it without looking away from the bowl*  If it happens, that's great.  If not, well...I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.

ImmortalSinclair: You were pretty upset with me at first.  *taking another bit of my sandwich, still watching you*

WereKarl: We were upset with each other.  It wasn't a particularly good time for us.  *continues to poke through the antipasto, spearing ham and cheese this time*

ImmortalSinclair: No, but you were still hurt.  

WereKarl: Just one of many.  *faint smile, glancing at you*  I was used to it at the time.

ImmortalSinclair: *holding my hand out for the antipasto bowl*  Alright, so talk to me about that.  Cause your journal didn't make much sense.  Just a lot of rambles about children and Ice and you wanting to be a woman.  Not terribly coherent.

WereKarl: *hesitates, then hands you the bowl*  My journal.  I don't have to be coherent in it.  *tries to smile, picking my sandwich up again*  What do you want to know?

ImmortalSinclair: I wasn't criticizing.  Just making an obseravation.  *eating a bit of pepperoni & black olive*

WereKarl: No, I know.  *pulls off small pieces of bread, chewing them as I watch you from the corner of my eye*

ImmortalSinclair: So, tell me what you were thinking.  *stabbing at more pepperoni*

WereKarl: About what?  *shrugs, focusing on the bread I'm pulling off*  About a baby?  Just thought it would be nice to have one with you.  Figured it'd be easier if I was a woman...no objections then, right?  But, you know, I don't always get what I want and I'm used to that.

ImmortalSinclair: No one ever does.  *shrugging, putting down the bowl*  Look, we don't have to talk about this.

WereKarl: No, you want to talk about it.  I'm just...not sure what, exactly, you want to discuss.

ImmortalSinclair: Whatever you'd like.  It's very important to you and I'm just trying to get a feel for that.  Tell me about Ice.  *picking my sandwich back up*

WereKarl: She's amazing.  *soft smile, remembering the talks I've had with her, the beauty of her soul though she tries to hide it*  But then...guess you'd know that already, huh?

ImmortalSinclair: Yeah, she's something else.  *smiling back at you*  The second best thing to ever happen to me.

WereKarl: Funny...I'd have thought that would be...  *pauses, glancing at you quickly*  Anyway, she's a wonderful person.  I really like her.  I wish...I wish the two of you were okay with each other.

ImmortalSinclair: I've known Ice a lot longer than Marton.  *gently reminding you*  And she was my first love.  How could she be anything less?  

WereKarl: It's not always easy to tell with you.  *small smile, going back to nibbling on my sandwich*

ImmortalSinclair: Well, she was.  *chewing thoughtfully before speaking again*  Father used to tell me that it was mutual love the second she first held me.

WereKarl: I can understand why.  *quietly, nibbling on a piece of pepperoni*  It's hard to imagine anyone could not love either of you.

ImmortalSinclair: You flatter me.  I've got many enemies.  *small frown as i think about the one waiting back for me at home*

WereKarl: I know.  *very quietly, looking down at the blanket, eyes moving over the pattern*  Ice could never be your enemy.

ImmortalSinclair: Oh, I know that.  *glancing at you, startled*  She'd sooner betray herself than me.

WereKarl: *nods*  The two of you need to talk, you know.

ImmortalSinclair: *squinting, looking out over the horizon*  Oh, we've talked, for all the good it did.  *slight shrug*  

WereKarl: *faint smile, nodding, aware of how well you talk to people when you're upset with them, doubting Ice is much better*  Didn't solve anything?  Didn't think it would.  But I'm sure you'll work it out sooner or later.

ImmortalSinclair: Sooner or later.  *shrugs again*  Not to mention I don't think Hugo's too thrilled with me.

WereKarl: He'll get over it.  Not many people he trusts.  *sets the rest of my sandwich down, pulling off some grapes to nibble on*  Your apology went a long way towards that.

ImmortalSinclair: You know, I still don't get why she never wanted him to know.

WereKarl: She's a private person.  *shrugs*  There are things she never told you.  I'm sure there are things she never told Diana.

ImmortalSinclair: I'm sure.  We all have our secrets...just this was a pretty big one.
ImmortalSinclair: *refrains from mentioning the other*

WereKarl: Yeah, I suppose it was.  *slowly eating my grapes, thinking it over*  Maybe you and her will find a way to compromise.

ImmortalSinclair: Well, I doubt we can stay mad at each other for too long.  *finally putting down my sandwish, contemplating*

WereKarl: Yeah.  *wrinkles my nose, looking up at the sky through the branches*  Forever's a long time to stay pissed at someone.

ImmortalSinclair: For some people, hate is an art.

WereKarl: I wouldn't know.  *small smile, looking back at you*

ImmortalSinclair: No.  *smiling back, but it's tinged with sadness*  And I hope you never do.

WereKarl: *soft sigh, rolling the remaining grapes around in my hand*  Hate's not something I'm good at.  So I guess I never will know.

ImmortalSinclair: You still don't think it's really him, do you?  *reaching for the thermos*

WereKarl: *shrugs*  I'm still not sure I see how it's possible, but if Marton was convinced, and you are, well...guess it must be true.

ImmortalSinclair: It's true.  *flatly*  I know it is.

WereKarl: Okay.  *quietly, setting the grapes down and brushing off my hands*

ImmortalSinclair: Sorry.  *sighing again*  I know you don't believe me, and that's alright.  I didn't mean to bring up any bad thoughts.

WereKarl: No, it's fine.  *shifts a little, leaning back on my elbows, watching the clouds drift across the sky*

ImmortalSinclair: *rolling over so my head is in your lap, sighing again*  This is too nice a day for unpleasantness.

WereKarl: Yes, it is.  *softly, one hand lifting to trail through your hair, still watching the clouds*

ImmortalSinclair: So, pick another subject.  *eyes closing under your touch*

WereKarl: *small shrug, glancing down at you*  Anything you'd like to talk about?

ImmortalSinclair: Nope.  *settling more firmly on your lap*  Just enjoying this

WereKarl: Okay.  *murmurs, fingers still combing through your hair, closing my eyes as the wind blows across my face*

ImmortalSinclair: Love you.  *sinking further into your touch, almost asleep*

WereKarl: *soft smile, fingers brushing across your forehead*  *murmurs*  Love you, too."

Brushing his hair back from his forehead, I place a soft kiss there, then reach for the telephone. Talking softly, not wanting to disturb him, I place an order with the kitchen. The girl on the phone tells me the basket will be ready in about thirty minutes. Wonderful. Plenty of time to wake up Harry. Of course, it's plenty of time for me to get nervous as well.

Lawrence, it's Karl. I need to ask you a favor...um...something came up, and Harry and I have to go out of town for a few days. I know it's short notice, but I'd really appreciate it if you could stop in and take care of the kids...ferrets...for me. This is the first time we've left them alone like this, and, well...I'm worried. :smiles: Their food's in the kitchen, there's a travel bed in the living room, and a bag with some of their toys should be there near it. Oh, and there's a litter box in the kitchen and one upstairs in the bedroom. They're really easy to take care of...if you have any questions, there's a book in our bedroom on how to take care of them. And you can call us.

And here I am again.</i>

Fuck. :softly, staring at the cover for a moment before turning to a clean page and uncapping my pen:

<i>I think it would be better if I were a mute. But, no. I can speak.

How could I have been so stupid to tell him, to bring up that first night just when things were going so well for us again? My own damn fault. I knew what would happen the second the words left my lips. And it did. Once again, we're back to that odd place where neither one of us knows what to say or do, and everything we do say or do isn't quite right. Or, in my case, it's very, very wrong. Sometimes, I think it would be best for him if I just left. He's not truly happy with me; he hasn't been in a long time. I can see it in his eyes, sometimes. And hear it in his voice when he talks about him. Maybe I should have acted one of those many times I considered just walking away and letting him go back to him. But I didn't. So here we are. And I no longer know what to do. I wish I did.

And the headaches are back. I didn't notice them at first, but they're definitely back. Not as bad as before, thankfully, but bad enough sometimes. Hopefully this one will go away soon. I wonder if the nightmares will return, too. And, if they do, what they'll foretell this time. I can't tell Harry, though. He's got enough on his mind without me adding something this trivial to it. Perhaps I'll go see Vig about them after the party. No time before then; too much still to do.

As for the idea of having a child to raise with him...just one more thing I should have kept to myself, considering how things are looking right now. One of these days I'll learn. Maybe.

I can't seem to find my pills, either. God, my life is so fucked up.</i>

:slowly closes the journal and slips it back in the table drawer where it's rested for so long, knowing Harry won't look in it:

:slides down on the sofa, turning the lamp off and curling up, watching the tree outside the window as it sways in the breeze, listening to the soft squeaks and chitters as the kids wrestle under the coffee table:"

<font size=1>[private convo, happened Monday night]</font>

WereKarl: *wanders through the park, hands deep in the pockets of my jacket, head down, not paying much attention to where I'm going*

SweetIceyVamp: *smiles as i see a familiar figure ahead of me, running to catch up quickly, silently, whispering in your ear*  such a dark night, lonely stranger, you never know just who you may run into under such stars...

WereKarl: *jumps a little, spinning to face you, eyes wide*  Jesus...scare a guy, why don't you?  *smiles*

SweetIceyVamp: *laughs, walking along side you*  you scare?  apparently harry hasn't rubbed off on you yet...i give it a few years....

WereKarl: Actually...  *linking arms with you as we walk*  ...he's pretty much the only one who can do it.  No one else can sneak up on me.

SweetIceyVamp: really?  wonder why that is....*smiles whistfully, wrapping a hand about your arm*  lovely ceremony last night...

WereKarl: Yes, it was.  *soft smile, lifting my face to look at the stars*  I'm glad it went well for Dom and Billy.  They deserved it.

SweetIceyVamp: i've never met dominic, but billy is a sweet man, such the charmer, reminds me of his father...

WereKarl: Billy's a wonderful person.  So is Dom.  *smiles down at you, hand covering yours on my arm*  I've only know them both a few months, but I already consider them to be good friends.

SweetIceyVamp: a few months?  *glances at you*  for some reason i thought you'd known them longer...i'll have to meet dominic one of these days....whenever they get over newlywed bliss

WereKarl: Harry's known Billy for a while.  *slows my steps, in no hurry, enjoying the crisp breeze and being with you*  I met them both when they first came to Zid.

SweetIceyVamp: *smile falters slightly at harry's name, slowing pace to match yours, watching the stars*  i'm glad they're so happy...i hope with all my heart it remains that way...

WereKarl: So do I.  *glances at you, sensing your mood's changed*  You okay?

SweetIceyVamp: *eyes casually scan the trees of the park, catching sight of different animals of the night hiding in bare branches*  fine, just...brings back a memory or two...

WereKarl: Anything you want to talk about?  *quietly, still watching you as we walk*

SweetIceyVamp: *shakes my head slowly*  just thinking about dae is all...wishing we could have ended with joy instead of sorrow...

WereKarl: *sad smile*  Perhaps you'll have that chance one day.

SweetIceyVamp: *shrugs, hand tightening on your arm*  with dae?  i don't know about that...we parted in anger, i do not know how well a reunion would work out...or even if one would happen, apparently she doesn't want to come back...

WereKarl: *touches your cheek with gentle fingers*  Anything's possible, love.  After all, Diana's forgiven you.

SweetIceyVamp: this is true...tho it was because of me we argued  *smiles hesitantly, raises hand to curl about your fingers*  and karl, has he forgiven me?  i know you claim you understand why i've said what i've said, but there is a subtle difference....

WereKarl: *doesn't have to ask who you mean by 'he'*  Honestly...I don't know.  *soft sigh*  He says he wants this, wants it to be you, but...I just don't know anymore.

SweetIceyVamp: did he tell you we talked?  i...know he needs time...and i do want to be a mother for the both of yours' child...but i fear most for our friendship...i feel a wall between us and i miss that ease, i've known him since he was a wee boy, never dreamed i'd see the pain in his eyes directed at me

WereKarl: He mentioned it, yes.  *quietly, steps slowing as we approach an empty park bench*  He's not a man who forgives easy.

SweetIceyVamp: *sighs, pulling us both down to sit on the stone bench*  this i know...patience is a virtue, i suppose...one i possess little of....

WereKarl: Much like Harry.  *faint smile*  He is talking to you, though.  That's a good thing.

SweetIceyVamp: yes, quite.  *returns the smile sadly*  quite surprised me when he said he was still considering it...talked to viggo, to destroy my blood samples, he looked and there's just a small chance my shifting abilities would pass on...perhaps why edmund never showed...

WereKarl: He surprised me, too, when he said he was thinking about it.  *leans back on the bench, pulling you with me, one arm curled around your shoulders*  The shifting doesn't bother me.

SweetIceyVamp: i imagine it wouldn't...doesn't hurt, like yours, at least...so if it did pass...altho you and i would get along and we wouldn't  *smiles, leaning against you*  viggo noticed i was twin, however...*chuckles lightly*  said that could pass on too...heaven forbid...

WereKarl: *soft laugh*  That could make things interesting.

SweetIceyVamp: quite  *chuckles*  let the record state that harry does know i had a twin sister  *shakes head*  and if the child would end up being two, hopefully they get along better than i did with mine, or hugo with mark for a time...

WereKarl: Oh, I think they would.  *smiles, memories flashing through my mind of Sylvia & Elsa and how close they were*

SweetIceyVamp: *grins*  you and harry both share the same smile when you think of diana's children...

WereKarl: Do we?  *grins back*  They were all three beautiful children.

SweetIceyVamp: yes, you do...told harry he did need a child, by me or anyone else...to bring that smile back...to you it seems to come easy

WereKarl: Maybe because I was their mother.  *quietly*  They all adored Harry, looked up to him, but...I was the one they told their secrets to.  I /knew/ each one in ways he never could.

SweetIceyVamp: perhaps...do you wish you were the mother again, not the possible father?

WereKarl: *soft chuckle*  That would be a feat for the record books.  I'll just be happy, no matter how it happens.

SweetIceyVamp: oh, i know it couldn't be possible, luv, just wondering how you'd handle not having that bond...or do you think your past as a mother would create it's own unique bond with the child?

WereKarl: It might.  Stranger things have happened.  I'd like to think it would give me an insight to their minds that Harry wouldn't have.

SweetIceyVamp: i think it just might...i hope harry decides to raise a child with you, no matter what the method, you both love them so much and find such joy in them...*smiles, touching your cheek tenderly*  brings a twinkle to your eye

WereKarl: *catches your hand in a gentle grip, kissing your fingers*  I hope he does, too.  *softly*  I just wish I knew for sure if he really wants it like he says he does.

SweetIceyVamp: you've asked him what his true feelings are?  wait, this is harry...*smiles*  he wants a child, i could see it in his eyes....i think he still fears the evil battling your lives

WereKarl: I know he still fears it.  *laces our fingers together, studying them for a moment*  I'm not sure he'll ever realize how much he's letting it control him.

SweetIceyVamp: *nods, wrapping my fingers tightly about your fingers*  perhaps...perhaps not...he's not one who likes to be controlled...

WereKarl: No, he doesn't.  Yet he's letting this faceless person dictate his life.

SweetIceyVamp: not faceless, per say...it's his own son...that's enough a face to haunt...*kisses your fingers lightly* how are you handling that?  the knowledge nicholas is your son and responsible for your curse, for marton's death, for harry's pain?  or are you choosing not to think about that for the moment?

WereKarl: I didn't raise a child capable of doing those things.  *softly, voice full of conviction*  Regardless of what Harry says, what Hugo says, what Marton says.  I'll believe Nicholas is Harry's son when I see it for myself.

SweetIceyVamp: and i didn't believe the extent of my sister's hatred...karl...*fingers pull gently on your chin, turning you to look at me directly*  please be somewhat prepared if it is truth...i don't want to see you suffer any more hurt than you have...

WereKarl: If it's the truth, fine.  *sighs*  I just don't see /how/ it can be true.

SweetIceyVamp: and i don't see how it could be, either, knowing nearly all your children...your past selves and harry raised beautiful, wonderful children, i don't understand how one could twist so to hate their father, or their mother

WereKarl: Neither can I.  They all loved Harry so much.

SweetIceyVamp: they did...as they did their mothers...i hope that's not what harry fears, that another could turn like that...

WereKarl: *hesitates*  He's mentioned it.

SweetIceyVamp: *nods*  i don't blame him, but once again, living in fear of what could be is no way to live one's life

WereKarl: I know.  I'm trying to convince him of that.

SweetIceyVamp: *smiles*  i imagine you are, luv...he'll decide soon enough, i'm sure, he just needs time...i've hurt him deeply, i'm afraid, by keeping who i am from him...my apologies

WereKarl: You had your reasons.  And one day he'll understand that.  *faint smile*  Not like he's always the most truthful person when it comes to hidden things.

SweetIceyVamp: heh, he's a very secretive man himself, telling what needs to be told, when it needs to be told...ah, the arrogance of being old...ancient...*smiles*  i hate that word...makes me _feel_ old

WereKarl: Sometimes he doesn't even tell then.  *very softly, giving your fingers a gentle squeeze*  But he's Harry.  *smiles a little*

SweetIceyVamp: *chuckles*  oui...that he is...a character in and of itself...his own adjective.  kept a few things from you?

WereKarl: Do I really need to answer that?  *gives you a calm look, then shrugs*  He does it to protect me.

SweetIceyVamp: we always want to protect the ones you love....it's a hard thing to accept, to understand you can't stifle or hide things from the ones you love in order to protect... *smiles sadly, turning my eyes from yours to stare at the stars again*  

WereKarl: *lifts your hand, kissing your fingers*  It's too nice a night to be sad.

SweetIceyVamp: *tightens my fingers about yours, smiling up into the dark sky*  you're right, of course...it's a beautiful night...when'd you get so smart?  *looks over at you, winking*  

WereKarl: Guess it just comes with the territory.  *winks back, standing abruptly and pulling you with me*  Come on.

SweetIceyVamp: *laughs, allowing myself to be pulled to my feet*  come on?  where are we going?

WereKarl: Nowhere, anywhere.  Doesn't matter.  *grins, pulling you after me until we're running through the park like two children*

SweetIceyVamp: *runs by your side, carefree as the wind whips through our hair, laughter on our lips*  christ, i feel like a kid again...let's climb a tree *speaks impulsively, grinning*

WereKarl: Great idea.  *looks around, then tugs you over to a suitable tree, hoisting you up with gentle hands at your waist until you can grab the lower branch*

SweetIceyVamp: *quickly catches the limb, swinging up nimbly and bending to offer a hand to you*

WereKarl: *smiles as I let you help me up, knowing you're stronger than I am*  It's been years since I did this.

SweetIceyVamp: *easily pulls you up, steadying myself on the main trunk and a branch above, scaling the next few feet on the closely packed lower branches*  i honestly can't remember the last time i climbed a tree....it's probably been at least a thousand years....*grins*

WereKarl: Hasn't been quite that long for me.  *chuckles, following you easily, working my way around until I'm on the opposite side of the trunk*

SweetIceyVamp: *tries to look through the branches to the top of the tree, poking my head from around the tree trunk, smiling at you, and continuing up, putting distance between the ground and us*  you know, you fall, harry will blow his top and have my ass on a silver platter faster then you could say ""but i'm not dead yet""...

WereKarl: And such a lovely ass it is, too.  *grins when you look down at me, quickly climbing a little higher so we're once again on the same level*  Besides, the fall would do nothing more than knock the wind out of me.  Harry'd never know.

SweetIceyVamp: *snorts, shaking my head, quietly moving to another branch, nearing the top, having to pull myself up a few when the branches get sparse, finally reaching a clearing near the top, giving a beautiful view of the city*  beautiful...haven't taken this view of things in quite some time... *softly*

WereKarl: Amazing how a little distance changes your entire perspective on things, isn't it?  *quietly, pulling myself up beside you, finding a sturdy branch to hold my weight*

SweetIceyVamp: indeed....*smiles, resting my arms and chin on a small branch, pulling it down lightly to get a better view*  everything looks so small...so insignificant...yet so, important to the whole  *snorts*  and here i go going slightly philosphical on you...

WereKarl: To see a world in a grain of sand and Heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.  *softly, looking out over the twinkling lights of the city*  Even the smallest things are important.

SweetIceyVamp: *smiles, reaching out to squeeze your arm lightly*  oui...even the smallest...think we could ever drag harry up a tree?  *winks*

WereKarl: Do you think he'd really /see/ the view?  *smiles*

SweetIceyVamp: *giggles softly*  doubt it...tho, he might....he surprises me sometimes...look at his time as a priest...

WereKarl: *feigned wince*  Let's not.  I was a nun that time.  *chuckles*

SweetIceyVamp: *laughs*  indeed...can't believe you were a nun either...

WereKarl: I have a little trouble believing that one myself.  *wry grin*  But apparently I was.

SweetIceyVamp:  yes, you were...between the two of you, i swear you've got all careers covered...

WereKarl: Yeah, we probably do.  *laughs*  Though most of mine dealt with staying at home, cooking, and raising children.

SweetIceyVamp: that was a few, and those were very important roles *lightly taps your nose, shifting my weight on the branch*  one of the most important unsung careers....

WereKarl: Never said it wasn't.  *smiles, catching your hand and gently biting your fingertip*  In fact, it's quite similar to what I do now.

SweetIceyVamp: *smothers a giggle, thinking harry the child you're mothering, knowing full-well he'd hate that thought spoken even far from his presence, wiggling my finger*  and do you enjoy it?

WereKarl: For the most part, yes.  It's peaceful and it gives me plenty of time to myself.  *touches the tip of your nose with a finger*  Sometimes it's a little boring, though.

SweetIceyVamp: a child would definitely make it unboring, you know...in fact, your life would never be boring again....until the child ages enough to move outta the house, and then it'll become moderately boring again...

WereKarl: I think I could get used to that.  *looks over at you, thoughtful*  Could you?

SweetIceyVamp: get used to it?  of course, but that all depends on what role you want me to play...i agreed to stay in new zealand if we go through with this, when i spoke with harry the other day...i'll be around for certain...

WereKarl: I'd want you to play as big a role as you wish.  *quietly, watching you in the moonlight*  I agree with Harry...a child needs more than just male influences growing up.

SweetIceyVamp: oh hell, like i'd let you two be the only influences  *smiles, ducking my head as you watch me, speaking softly*  again, i'm honored you'd want me as an influence, as a part, as the biological mother...

WereKarl: *smiles, reaching out to let my fingers trail through your hair*  I can't think of anyone else I'd like more.

SweetIceyVamp: *blushes lightly, again amazed how easily you can do that, changing topics despite the cover of darkness*  you know, you remind me a little of dae, too...i hope you get to meet her someday....

WereKarl: *cocks my head, still watching you*  I do?  How so?

SweetIceyVamp: strong-willed, determined, you effortlessly wrap yourself about the hearts of people you meet ...*shrugs*  

WereKarl: There are worse things I could be.  Arrogant, stubborn, hard-headed.  *winks*

SweetIceyVamp: *grins*  hmmm....works for some, not for you...altho, i'm guessing you can be stubborn when you want to be...

WereKarl: Sometimes.  Not often.  *quietly, shrugging and settling back against the tree to watch the stars*

SweetIceyVamp: *watches you, reaching up to swing idly from a branch*  something on your mind, luv?

WereKarl: No, not really.  *small smile, glancing over at you*  Just thinking about everything.

SweetIceyVamp: hmm...thinking, with such a pensive expression...i thought the eve was supposed to be filled with happiness and beauty

WereKarl: I'm sorry, you're right.  *smiles at you again*  Shall we adjourn back to ground level again then, m'lady, and get on with the happiness and beauty?

SweetIceyVamp: *laughs, broadly gesturing down*  after you...

WereKarl: *starts to climb down slowly, keeping an eye on you, not stopping until I reach the bottom branch and can jump lightly to the ground*

SweetIceyVamp: *gives up about halfway down, spotting an opening in the branches, leaps to the ground, landing silently beside you, dusting my hands*  come, i'll walk you back to where you're staying...

WereKarl: Going to protect me from the things that go bump in the night?  *smiles, linking our arms together again*

SweetIceyVamp: something like that  *smiles, touching your cheek*  i can at least spot 'em quicker than you can...

WereKarl: True.  But they can't hurt me.  *reminds you in a soft voice*  Harry's made sure of that.

SweetIceyVamp: well, fine, i'm walking with you back to your place for my own safety, you can stand between the bad guys and myself  *smiles, squeezing your arm* 

WereKarl: You just want me between you and them so you can ogle my ass. *winks*

SweetIceyVamp: and such a lovely ass it is, too  *quips, grinning*  what's harry been up to whilst you've been here?

WereKarl: Time for himself.  We don't spend every second together, contrary to popular belief.  *smiles, bumping against you a bit*  Actually, I think he was just going out for a bit.

SweetIceyVamp: *gasps, jostling you back*  you don't?  he seemed to be enjoying himself at the wedding, i noticed you slipped a little something on him?  

WereKarl: I, um...yes, I did.  *mumbles, flushing a little, glad it's dark*

SweetIceyVamp: and did he like said something you slipped on him?  *grins, kissing your cheek*  you're cute when you blush, by the way, turn about's fair play

WereKarl: Yes, he did like it.  *smiles, ignoring the last comment*  It was a ring.

SweetIceyVamp: *smiles, tucking hair behind your ear*  how sweet.....combined with your kilt, i bet he was all grins

WereKarl: *shrugs, glancing up at the sky*  You know Harry.

SweetIceyVamp: *snorts softly*  what, he brush you off?  he do that, i'll strangle him myself...

WereKarl: No, he doesn't have it in him to brush me off, I don't think.  *faint smile*  We just went back to the apartment and, you know.  Just spend the rest of the evening in, relaxing.

SweetIceyVamp: and, you know...*laughs*  so that's what kids are calling it these days ...

WereKarl: Yeah, exactly.  *chuckles*

SweetIceyVamp: and here i thought you had such a way with words....*winks*  i'm glad he liked it...no ceremony for you?  i tried to weasel out of hugo when he and lawrence were going to tie the knot, he just choked on his champaigne, i don't understand.. *smiles in feigned innocence*

WereKarl: Well, actually...we had a ceremony, of sorts, in Bulgaria.  What Dom and Billy did...I don't need that.

SweetIceyVamp: the bonding ceremony, no?  a typical non-thracian ceremony, don't need it... don't want one?

WereKarl: *nods*  Yeah, the bonding ceremony.  We had that.  I have a ring.  He has one now.  We don't need a 'legal' ceremony.

SweetIceyVamp: pity....*eyes you up and down, smirking*  you'd look good in white...

WereKarl: *rolls my eyes*  Harry might disagree.

SweetIceyVamp: *laughs*  what, with white?  yeah, he might prefer red instead..

WereKarl: Actually...  *flashes you a wicked smile, dropping my voice to a low purr*  He prefers me in nothing.

SweetIceyVamp: hmmm....i bet he does...should be your new look...nothing....i think you could pull it off well...you'd never leave your house, granted, but we'd come and visit, talk through the door and all

WereKarl: Oh, I don't know.  *smiles, trailing my fingers up your spine as we walk*  I think a select few would be allowed inside and not have to talk through the door.

SweetIceyVamp: *hides a shiver at your touch, wrapping my arm about your waist, leaning my head against your shoulder as we walk*  well, those select few would call themselves lucky, i think 

WereKarl: You think so?  *wrapping my arm around your shoulders, smiling*  I could be absolutely horrid looking under my clothes.

SweetIceyVamp: i don't believe it for one minute...for one thing, i know harry's tastes

WereKarl: *soft snort*   Yes, but he doesn't have much choice in which body he gets with the soul, does he?

SweetIceyVamp: true, but you've a beautiful soul, it's reflected on the outside as well as inside...

WereKarl: The same could be said of you.

SweetIceyVamp: *feels my cheeks reddened, glad for my own self the cover of darkness, having been called many things over the years, but never that*  t-thank you, karl...a beautiful soul, not something i'm used to hearing, some would say it had been darkened from the start

WereKarl: *stops outside the apartment, turning to look at you, tipping your chin up*  And they would be ignorant fools who never bothered to see past the fangs to the beautiful person behind them.

SweetIceyVamp: well, many the ignorant fool then  *smiles, kissing your lips lightly*  you're a good, sweet man, karl.  speak well for the gender...gives me hope for 'em  *winks*  thank you for your company tonight

WereKarl: Thank you for yours, sweet.  *smiles, pressing a soft kiss to your forehead*  Don't worry...Harry will come around.

SweetIceyVamp: i won't hold my breath...*squeezes your hand as i turn to walk away*  have a good eve, luv. 

WereKarl: You, too.  *calls softly, watching you vanish into the dark before turning to walk into the apartment*"

<font size=1>[private convo, happens during the wedding]</font>

WereKarl: *follows you, curious but in a good mood*  Enjoy your vacation in Norway?

makaore: Yeah, it was great.  *nodding, distracted, keeps seeing that fucking ring on Harry's finger*  You...ah...was that a wedding band I saw you give Harry?

WereKarl: *soft smile, glancing back at where Harry sits at the table, talking to Hugo*  Technically, yes.

makaore: Technically?

WereKarl: It's a wedding band, yes.  But we obviously didn't have a wedding.  *shrugs*

makaore: Then why give him a band?

WereKarl: Because we don't need the ceremony.  *softly, glancing at Harry again*  We're bonded already.

makaore: Yes, I know.  *thinking at how impossible the Thracian bond is to break*

WereKarl: *looks back at you*  The ring's just an outward symbol of that.  Like this one.  *lifts my left hand, showing the black opal & gold ring there*

makaore: *taking your hand in mine, studying the design*  Cocksucker... *under my breath...the ring is very similiar to the one that never left Diana's hand*

WereKarl: What?  *didn't quite catch that, frowning just a little*  Something wrong?

makaore: Yeah, a bit.  *putting my hands in my pockets*  Just...weddings.  Make me...dunno.  Depressed.  Edgy.

WereKarl: Depressed?  *studies your face, confused*  They usually make people happy.

makaore: My sisters were both engaged when they were murdered.  *softly*

WereKarl: Oh.  *sudden flash of deja vu hits me, making me pause for a second before shaking my head*  I'm sorry.

makaore: Yeah.  *sighs*  Sorry...I'm...please, go back to Harry.

WereKarl: Hey...  *softly, touching your arm with a hesitant hand*  Something you need to talk about?

makaore: I don't think it's anything you can help.  *grasping your hand anyway, needing the touch*

WereKarl: You sure?  *voice still soft, concerned, an almost overwhelming urge to make you feel better sweeping through me*  Sometimes it helps to just talk.

makaore: *glancing up at you with pain-filled eyes*  I just miss them so much.  And I look at all of this...and I wish...

WereKarl: I'm sure you do.  *giving in to the urge, hating to see you in pain nearly as much as I hate to see Harry in pain, drawing you into my arms and hugging you tightly*

makaore: *resting my head on yours, hugging you back, breathing in your almost familiar scent, arms tight around you*

WereKarl: *hands rub over you back in small, soothing circles*  I'm sorry you had to go through that.

makaore: Not your fault.  *mumbling into your hair*

WereKarl: I can still wish you hadn't had to deal with it.  *soft kiss on your cheek, still rubbing your back*  No one should ever have to go through losing their entire family at one time.

makaore: *pulling back slightly, a bit embarrassed*  You must think I'm so weak.  *brushing a few tears off of my cheek*

WereKarl: Please.  *soft smile, looking into your eyes, brushing the tears away with gentle fingers*  If you think that, I wish you could have seen me a few months ago.

makaore: *looks at you questioningly*

WereKarl: When I first changed into a panther.  *shrugs, looking down*  I didn't exactly deal with it all that well.

makaore: Oh.  *first stirrings of guilt going through me*  How...um...what did happen?

WereKarl: I basically fell apart for a while.  *quietly, remembering those few weeks*  Became very dependant on Harry, clinging to him...frightened out of my mind, very emotional...wasn't pretty.

makaore: I can imagine.  *stroking your cheek with the tips of my fingers*  But you made it.  I think you're the strongest person I know.

WereKarl: *faint blush*  I don't feel it sometimes.

makaore: You are, though.  *conviction in my tone*  You've gone through so much and you're still here, still fighting.  I admire that.  *kissing your forehead*  I wish I could be more like you sometimes.

WereKarl: No, you don't want to be like me.  *smiles a little, looking up at you*  Harry's a much better role model.

makaore: No, I don't think so.  He's immortal, he knows he's got the benefit of time.  His strength is in the earth...yours, you made yourself.

WereKarl: *flushes again, oddly pleased that you think so*  Maybe.  He had a hand in who I am today, though.

makaore: Yeah, I guess he did.  *smiles*  And you managed to turn out alright, anyway

WereKarl: *startled laugh*  Ouch.  If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't like Harry or something.  *winks*

makaore: He's a particular favorite.  *grins*  But his ego's big enough.

WereKarl: Comes with being that old.  *grins, stud clicking softly against my teeth*  The ego's one of his more endearing qualities.

makaore: It does make him who he is.  *remembering when I thought like you*

WereKarl: Yes, it does.  *unaware there's a faint lisp on my s's now, still getting used to talking around the stud*  He's really not that bad, though.

makaore: You keep saying that.  *reaching out to touch the stud with gentle fingers the next time you stick out your tongue a bit*  Did you know that he thanked me for being friends with you?

WereKarl: *blinks, eyes crossing as I try to look at your fingers*  Did he?  Sounds like something he'd do.  *smiles*  He takes care of me.

makaore: A bit too much, I think, sometimes.  *smiling when you stick your tongue out further so I can play with the stud*  But, he's a lot older than you...to be expected.

WereKarl: Too much?  *tries not to laugh at the feel of your fingers brushing over my tongue and the stud*  How so?

makaore: Dunno.  *finally dropping my fingers*  Just seems like you two are a bit too wrapped up in each other sometimes.  Not that I'm not like that with Hugo, so I guess I have no idea what I'm saying.

WereKarl: You sound like Craig.  *soft sigh*  The only explanation I can give is that I love Harry more than I've ever loved anyone else in my life.  He completes me.  *shrugs, glancing back towards the table*  Guess you could say I'm not whole without him.

makaore: *nods*  No, I don't guess you are.  

WereKarl: It's part of the soulmate thing.  *quietly*  He's not whole without me, either.

makaore: He's not whole anyway now.  *just as quietly*  

WereKarl: *pain flashes through me and I fight to keep from closing my eyes against it*  No, but he's getting there.

makaore: You really think he ever will be?  Whole, I mean.  *tucking a bit of your hair behind your ear*  

WereKarl: Maybe.  *softly, one shoulder lifting in a shrug*  One day.

makaore: Okay.  *smiles, kissing the wrinkle between your brows*  Stop frowning, Harry & Hugo will think we're arguing.

WereKarl: Sorry.  *faint sigh, forcing myself to smile up at you*

makaore: Hey, it's alright.  

WereKarl: Yeah, sure.  *glances towards the table*  So...anything else you want to talk about?

makaore: Not really, I just...*squeezes your hand*  I'm sorry.  For both of us.  *leans down to kiss your cheek*  It'll get better.

WereKarl: Yeah, I suppose it will.  *sad smile, squeezing your fingers in return*  Ready to go back?

makaore: Yeah, I guess.  *gives you another tight hug*  I love you, you know.

WereKarl: *a little startled*  I love you, too.  *smiles up at you, realizing I mean it, amazed at how fast it happened and how Harry's the only other person I felt this strongly about this quickly*

makaore: I'll try to be worthy of it.  *taking your hand & walking with you back to the table*

WereKarl: *thinks you already are as I walk beside you*"

<font size=1>[private convo, happens before the wedding]</font>

IceQueenCraig: *enjoying my walk here, finally reaching your place, double checking with the address Harry gave me, knocking on the door* 

WereKarl: *tries to keep an eye on the kids as I pull open the door, knowing how much they like to run outside at home*  Hey!

IceQueenCraig: Hello, stranger. *smiles, slides in, scooping up an attempted escapee in my arms as I do* 

WereKarl: Thanks.  *flashes you a relieved smile as you catch Vidam before she can get outside, closing the door so Szoros can't get out*  Glad to see you made it okay.

IceQueenCraig: *pets her under her chin, smiling at how cute she is* Which one is this then? And yes, we got here just fine. More private jetting. *smirk* Can't bear to fly commercial now. Plus I think we would've scandalized the entire plane had we done so. 

WereKarl: *chuckles, remembering how close Harry & I came to scandalizing the other passengers*  I'm sure.  *watches Vidam half close her eyes, stretching her neck out for more scratching*  That's Vidam, the female terror of the pair.  Szoros is hiding.

IceQueenCraig: *continues to scratch, smiling at how adorable she is* Ah, so Szoros is the shy one? 

WereKarl: Yeah.  *smiles, kneeling down to coax him from under the sofa*  He's Harry's, go figure.  If he was here right now, you'd see what I mean.

IceQueenCraig: Ah... so this beauty's yours then? *talking to Vidam* And do you take after Daddy then, precious? Do you forget people's phone number and addresses for weeks on end? *smirks, continuing to talk to her* I bet you do. Get your pretty little head all caught up in stroking and snuggling and your boyfriend.... *finally turns my head up to you, sticking my tongue out* 

WereKarl: *smiles, accepting the rebuke gracefully*  I suppose I could say the same for you, but I don't want to argue.  Sorry for not calling, sorry for not dropping by, my only excuse is that I've been busy.  *flashes you a charming smile, unaware of the faint lisp I've got from the tongue piercing now, still trying to get used to it*

IceQueenCraig: *sees the flash as you smile, curious, going up to you, poking my finger in your mouth* What have you done? 

WereKarl: *pulls back, trying not to laugh, grabbing your wrist*  Would you stop?  And I didn't do much.  Just this.  *pokes my tongue out so you can see the pearl stud*

IceQueenCraig: And when did you get that? *peering at it* 

WereKarl: Thursday afternoon.  *grins, clicking it against my teeth*

IceQueenCraig: And you lived through the pain? *grimaces at the mere thought of it* 

WereKarl: It actually wasn't too bad.  *shrugs, dropping onto the sofa and gesturing for you to sit*  Only really hurt for a few minutes, then Harry took care of it for me.  The hard part was sitting still long enough for him to put the needle through my tongue.

IceQueenCraig: *shudders* You're braver than I am. I'll have to ask Harry if he can come with me when I... *trails off, flushing slightly* 

WereKarl: *eyes you, intensely curious*  When you what?

IceQueenCraig: *mumbles, suddenly fascinated with Vidam again* getmybellybuttonpierced

WereKarl: *stares at you, trying not to laugh*  So you're going to go through with it?

IceQueenCraig: Yes, I am. If it'll get Orlando to get his done, I'll do it. Plus, Atti's quite enthusiastic about the fringe benefits... *smirk* 

WereKarl: Well, I can't speak for a navel ring, but I know Harry certainly seems to enjoy this thing.  *smirks, tapping it against my front teeth again*  And I'm sure he'd be happy to hold your hand through it, too.

IceQueenCraig: *eyes you* I bet he does. Sure, you'll get a tongue piercing to do naughty things to Harry with, but where was this newfound bravery when *we* were together? *mock glare-pout* 

WereKarl: *snorts*  Like I could have ever gotten my tongue pierced when I was with you.  You know how I am about needles...and god knows you'd have passed out first when the guy picked up the piercing needle.  *smiles*

IceQueenCraig: *chuckles* Probably. 

WereKarl: *watches Szoros creep out from under the sofa to crawl up in my lap*  So how are things going with Orli?

IceQueenCraig: *fond smile* Good. Excellent. Fabulous. We're going to pop down to London in a day or so and meet his mum and sister. I'm a bit nervous about it, but he assures me it'll go well. 
IceQueenCraig: How've you been? Strange that I've seen Harry more than you lately.. 

WereKarl: I'm just glad he's getting out more.  *very softly, scratching Szoros' chin*  I've just been busy...the kids, the restaurant, the reception.

IceQueenCraig:  And..? I can't imagine it's been easy for you either lately.... I've never seen Harry the way he's been. Had to have been tough on you... 

WereKarl: You have no idea.  *small shrug, looking up at you*  The days following Marton's death scared the hell out of me.  And Harry's doing better now, but still...there are times when I look at him and just know.

IceQueenCraig: Just know... that he's thinking about Marton? 

WereKarl: Yeah, and wishing things had been different.  *lifts Szoros to my face, nuzzling his soft fur as he squeaks softly and sniffs my hair*

IceQueenCraig: Different how? *perplexed* As in Marton would still be alive....or... ? 

WereKarl: Or.  *voice muffled, still holding Szoros close*

IceQueenCraig: *eyes you* Spill.... what the fuck's been going on with you two? 

WereKarl: Nothing.  *looks at you*  Things are actually really good right now.

IceQueenCraig: But they weren't, it seems like.....and you didn't call or anything. *curious, slightly injured look* 

WereKarl: Why call and burden you with something we'd already talked about?  *tired smile*  The jealousy was something I had to deal with on my own.

IceQueenCraig: *shrugs, not really understanding* I don't know...because we're friends and because it seems like you might've needed someone to lean on or just be there for you? 

WereKarl: Craig, I always knew you were there.  And that meant a lot.  *softly, setting Szoros back in my lap*  But you know me...I either talk too much or not enough.

IceQueenCraig: I suppose. 

WereKarl: I would have come to you, but what was I supposed to say?  That I'm jealous of a ghost?  Hardly anything new there.

IceQueenCraig: Seems that you had good reason to be.... I still don't understand it myself so I guess I wouldn't've been much help. 

WereKarl: *slumps down, fingers working into Szoros' fur, watching you*  I don't understand it either, but I live with it.  Not much else I can do, really.

IceQueenCraig: Are you two really okay? 

WereKarl: I think we're okay, yeah.  Sometimes I have a little doubt, but it goes away quickly.  *faint smile*  And Harry really is doing better, more focused on making our relationship work, more focused on living.

IceQueenCraig: He came to see me the other day....and we were talking about children. We got distracted by the subject of Nicholas....but I gathered that you want to have a child, biologically, and he's not so keen on it? 

WereKarl: Ah...  *startled, surprised that Harry discussed that with anyone*  He told you that, did he?

IceQueenCraig: Well, he asked me how I'd feel if Orlando wanted that....and then said that you wanted that and he was unsure about it... 

WereKarl: I just want a child to raise with him.  How we get it is irrelevant.  *shifts, looking down, still a little amazed that he actually talked about it*  But yes, I don't think it's something he really wants.

IceQueenCraig: Well, Orlando and I are seriously looking into adopting. With me getting ready to start the agency....I've just been thinking about how many children don't have parents to love them and just *shrug* . Dunno... I think Harry's too caught up in the Nicholas thing. I mean you can't put yourlife on hold until things are ""just perfect"". It won't ever happen. You have to seize the moment. Or something. 

WereKarl: *nods*  I've tried telling him that...that we can't let Nicholas dictate our lives.  He says he understands and that he'll think about it.  I just...don't know.

IceQueenCraig: Why do *you* want a child right now? 

WereKarl: *shrugs, looking down again, smiling a little as Szoros nips at my fingers*  I just do.  I love kids, you know that.

IceQueenCraig: Does it have anything to do with how rocky things were? Maybe thinking this would help cement things a bit? 

WereKarl: A little, maybe.  *slowly, almost reluctant*  But it's like I told Harry...I want someone we can teach what we know, show the world to, see the world through his or her eyes...  *quietly*  Something to make us remember all the joy in life.

IceQueenCraig: Have you considered adopting or are you set on surrogacy? 

WereKarl: I'd like a child of my own, but...  *lifts one shoulder in a shrug, brushing stray hair off my forehead*  It doesn't really matter how we get one.

IceQueenCraig: And what are Harry's objections other than Nicholas? 

WereKarl: That's the only definite one he's given.  I think part of it is also that he's used to being the father.

IceQueenCraig: That's right....hmm... the two of you never adopted or did surrogacy in any of your male incarnations? 

WereKarl: No.  All the others were content with the way things were.  *stops for a moment, smiling as Vidam puts her front paws on your chest and sniffs your chin*  Of course, all the others never had all the memories to deal with, either.

IceQueenCraig: *laughs at Vidam* Hey! That tickles! *curious look at you* You've got all their memories? 

WereKarl: Yeah, all 17 previous lives.  Ever since Vig did whatever it was he did to make me immortal.

IceQueenCraig: Jesus...that's got to mess with your head a bit.. 

WereKarl: Y'think?  *faint smile*  Just a little, yes.

IceQueenCraig: Is it like having multiple personality disorder or something? 

WereKarl: Sometimes.  *soft laugh, raking a hand through my hair*  It's odd at times, remembering things that I know never happened to /me/.

IceQueenCraig: *still incredulous* And are you seeing Vig or someone to help you deal with that? 

WereKarl: *shrugs, glancing away*  Harry said he'll help me learn to control it.

IceQueenCraig: I know that you love Harry and all, but there are other people in the world besides you two. And perhaps someone with more objectivity and some professional expertise would be best in this situation... 

WereKarl: *blinks*  And you're saying Vig would be objective when it comes to me, the first mortal he let get close to him since Peter?

IceQueenCraig: I think that Vig would be more objective than Harry..the man who's been in love with all 17 incarnations.. 

WereKarl: Maybe.  *shrugs*  But Vig's in his little Atti-bubble right now.

IceQueenCraig: Oh for fuck's sake. And you're in your Harry bubble and I""m in my Orl bubble.... if you need help, you just have to ask him. Or I will. 

WereKarl: Craig...I'm fine.  It's not as bad as it was to begin with...and Vig knows already.

IceQueenCraig: I know he knows....but have you asked him to help you with it? 
IceQueenCraig: And stop isolating yourself. We all need to stop that. 

WereKarl: What's to help?  The main problem is figuring out what memories go with which personality...and only Harry can help me with that.

IceQueenCraig: I mean dealing with the having of 17 personalities worth of memories within you while your lover's mourning another lover's death and shutting you out and not wanting a child and dealing with various other real life random issues. that's a lot of shit, Karl. 

WereKarl: *blinks, taking a moment to decipher the torrent of words*  Craig...how do you propose that Viggo's going to help me with all that?

IceQueenCraig: He's a shrink. That's what he does....helps people to deal with *waves hands around* all that

WereKarl: A lot of it is stuff that Harry and I have to deal with together, though.

IceQueenCraig: okay, *throws up hands* whatever works. Go be in your Harry bubble then. 

WereKarl: *sighs, rubbing my eyes*  Craig, don't.  Please.

IceQueenCraig: I just want you to get some help. From a professional. You can't deal with everything on your own. That's all. 

WereKarl: I know.  And when it gets to be too much, I'll get help.  I promise.  *smiles*  Right now, things are fine.

IceQueenCraig: As long as you're fine. I just worry about you. Isolation is never your friend in particular. You just get moody and morose and think way more than any person should in a lifetime. *fond smile* 

WereKarl: And that's different from usual how?  *smiles, stretching my legs out in front of me, shifting a little as Szoros climbs on my shoulder and sniffs at the hoop in my ear*

IceQueenCraig: *eyes your ear* Oh sweet mother... you got that pierced too? Any other piercings? *smirk* 

WereKarl: No.  *chuckles*  Just my ear and my tongue.  Harry's the one with the balls to get his dick pierced.

IceQueenCraig: *eyes wide* He..... *mouth open* 

WereKarl: *slides down on the sofa, laughing*  No, not recently.  But he did once.

IceQueenCraig: *still blinking* Jesus... *hand going instinctively to cover myself at the mere thought of it* 

WereKarl: *nods, still laughing*  I know!  My 'boys' tried to crawl back up inside when I found out.

IceQueenCraig: The whole way through? I mean... aahh... *shudders* 

WereKarl: You'd have to ask him.  *grins, winking*  I didn't ask why type piercing he had.

IceQueenCraig: Okay, that was in the realm of information about Harry I never needed to know. *chuckles, still wincing slightly at the thought* 

WereKarl: *tries to sit up, doubles over laughing instead*  Stick around, I'm sure I could come up with a few more things you never wanted to know about him.

IceQueenCraig: *eyes wide again, but laughing, putting hands over my ears, making 'lalala"" noises* No thank you. 

WereKarl: You sure?  *winks, finally managing to sit back up*  Might be educational.

IceQueenCraig: As it is now, I'm going to be hard pressed to stop my eyes from going straight to his crotch the next time I see him. *snickers* 

WereKarl: Well, the only thing between your eyes and it will be some thin, Scottish plaid.  *grins*

IceQueenCraig: I think I'll just focus on Orlando in his leather kilt then. Keep my eyes far away from Harry and his haggis.

WereKarl: *tries really hard not to laugh again*  So I suppose you don't want to hear that he tastes much better than haggis?

IceQueenCraig: *whimpers, shutting my eyes* I hate you. 

WereKarl: No, you don't.  *cheeky grin*  You love me, and you know it.

IceQueenCraig: *sticks out tongue at you*

WereKarl: *sticks tongue out back at you, knowing the pearl is gleaming and can't be missed*

IceQueenCraig: *eyes the pearl* You're such a tease. 

WereKarl: *waggles my tongue, grinning as your eyes follow it*  Taken you this long to figure that out?

IceQueenCraig: Wonder if Vig can make a time machine? I just want a few hours with you and that thing.. *smirk* 

WereKarl: *laughs*  I think Harry might object to that.

IceQueenCraig: And Orlando as well. *chuckles* I'll just have to talk him into the belly piercing sooner than. Distract me. *grin* 

WereKarl: Tell him to go with a diamond stud instead of a hoop.  *winks, knowing your weakness for sparkly things*

IceQueenCraig: *eyes light up* Oh yes. Definitely. 

WereKarl: *grins*  If you two do adopt, please get a little girl.  A little boy just won't look right in all the sparkly stuff you're sure to buy.

IceQueenCraig: *laughs* That's true. And I'm sure we will get a little girl and spoil her rotten in sparkly-ness. *frowns, remembering how much Kyra loves sparkly things* 

WereKarl: I'm sure you will.  *smiling a little, wondering at your frown*  I'd like one of each, actually.  Suppose I'll be lucky to get one.

IceQueenCraig: *eyes sad* You will. You have a lot of love to give. And Harry too. You'll be a great dad. *stroking Vidam, watching her sleep* 

WereKarl: I know.  And I want so much for him to have the chance to be a father again.

IceQueenCraig: *mumbles* Yeah, he deserves that. So do you. 

WereKarl: *soft smile*  Thanks.  Hopefully you and Orli can find the perfect child for you.

IceQueenCraig: *nods* We will. *sighs, meeting your gaze* No one's heard from Liv lately? 

WereKarl: *shakes head*  Not a peep that I know of.  I'm starting to wonder if she may be intending to never return this time.

IceQueenCraig: *frowns, sighs* I hope not. For Kyra's sake. 

WereKarl: You know how Liv is, though.  If she thinks this is the right course of action, no one will be able to convince her otherwise.

IceQueenCraig: I know. I just hope that she thinks it through. Kyra needs to know her dad. For all his faults, Bean loves her and she needs him in her life. 

WereKarl: I know.  *softly*  It'll be selfish of Liv to keep her from him, and I've never known Liv to be selfish.

IceQueenCraig: Me either. I'm scared for her as well. I've never seen her like this before. *small smile* I do know that Kyra's okay.... I talked to her the other night... *sheepish grin* 

WereKarl: That's good.  Means that Liv's not trying to block her from talking to anyone.  *smiles, settling Szoros down beside me so he can curl up*

IceQueenCraig: I... gave her disco balls. *more sheepish grinning* She liked them. 

WereKarl: *chuckles*  Somehow, I'm not surprised.

IceQueenCraig: I hope I get to seeher... 

WereKarl: I'm sure you will.  I'm sure we all will."

We got here safely, and once again I discovered that Harry owns yet another property I wasn't aware of. <a href=""http://www.sinclairhouse.com"">The Sinclair House</a>, about 15 miles west of Glasgow proper.

The guys from the Bistro got here on time, too. So they'll be spending a large portion of tomorrow getting everything prepared for the reception. It's heavy on Scottish dishes (obviously), but I did throw in a few Greek and Australian dishes for those who might not like haggis. :winks: Looks like a lot of food when I scan the list, but it's not.

Oh...and I had a little free time, so I picked up <a href=http://gilletts.com.au/imagesb/f6234b.jpg>something</a> for Harry. Now I just have to work up the nerve to actually give it to him to wear...

ImmortalSinclair: *sipping my scotch in the darkened living room, familiar, welcome weight of szoros and vidam curled next to me on the sofa*

WereKarl: *walks inside quietly, dropping my keys on the small table by the door, trudging towards the stairs, thinking you're upstairs since all the lights down here are off*

ImmortalSinclair: Hey.  *softly calling after you*

WereKarl: *turns in mid-step, walking into the living room, picking your form out in the darkness*  Hey.

ImmortalSinclair: *small smile, flash of white teeth in the dark*  Join me.

WereKarl: *moves towards you, sitting after making sure I won't squash either of the kids*

ImmortalSinclair: *resting my head on your shoulder, needing the contact*  Missed you.

WereKarl: *slides my hand down your arm, lacing our fingers together*  Missed you, too.  Sorry it took so long.

ImmortalSinclair: It's alright.  *kissing our joined fingers*  I imagine the two of you had a lot to talk about.

WereKarl: A little, yeah.

ImmortalSinclair: *very softly, squeezing your hand*  I'm sorry, epaei.

WereKarl: *small shrug*  Not your fault, Sin.  I'm the one who should be apologizing.

ImmortalSinclair: Not like you knew.  *placing a kiss on your neck*  Hell, I should be apologizing for never asking her.

WereKarl: Don't suppose it's something you ask someone.  *softly, looking down at our joined hands*

ImmortalSinclair: No, I don't suppose it is.  *low voice*  A lot to process for you, I imagine.

WereKarl: I'll deal.  *faint smile*  I always do.

ImmortalSinclair: Don't dismiss this.  *softly*  You're hurting, and we both know it.

WereKarl: What do you want me to say?  *looks at you*  Yes, I let my hopes get lifted and I shouldn't have.

ImmortalSinclair: She didn't give you all of the facts.  *gazing back at you*  You're not to blame here.

WereKarl: No, but...like you, I didn't ask.  *soft sigh*  And I should have.

ImmortalSinclair: How would you even know it was a question *to* ask?  Didn't think you knew all that much about vampires.

WereKarl: I lived with Craig for a year.  *reminds you, shifting a little to look out the window*

ImmortalSinclair: That doesn't mean too much.  Craig shunned most of the old ways.  *putting my head back on your shoulder*

WereKarl: True.  *another sigh, letting my head fall back against the sofa*  I'm sorry I pushed it, Harry.

ImmortalSinclair: Don't.  No more apologies.  Why should you apologize for wanting a child?  *turning to kiss your neck again*  You have no reason to apologize.

WereKarl: Why?  Because you were right and I was wrong.  Timing was shitty, there's still Nicholas...I didn't know enough of what I should have known...  *voice drops to a whisper*  And I still want a child.

ImmortalSinclair: I know.  *squeezing your hand*  I'm so sorry this didn't work out.  

WereKarl: Me, too.  *swallows, staring at the dark ceiling*  Guess we'll just think about it later, maybe find someone who's more acceptable to you.

ImmortalSinclair: To me?  *brow furrowed*  What do I have to do with it?

WereKarl: Told you.  I'm not going to do this without your full support.

ImmortalSinclair: Yes, but why are we talking about me?  *still puzzled*  You're not upset by this?

WereKarl: *lifts my head to look at you, expression completely open, hiding nothing*  Of course I'm upset.

ImmortalSinclair: So talk to me about that.

WereKarl: Nothing to talk about.  *soft, faintly bitter laugh*  I thought I had something that was guaranteed to work once we'd addressed your concerns.  Had no fucking clue you'd have a whole new set of concerns pop up afterwards.

ImmortalSinclair: I'm not concerned.  *lifting my head*  I don't care about the child being a shift.  I care that Ice lied to me my entire life about who she was.

WereKarl: Would it have changed how you felt about her if you'd known?

ImmortalSinclair: Of course not.  *immediate answer*  It explains a lot about her.

WereKarl: Does knowing now make her a different person?

ImmortalSinclair: In a way, yes.  That she was capable of keeping this from me for as long as she says...

WereKarl: It doesn't change her.  *quietly*  It changes your perception of her.  Just like finding out that you had omitted things from what you told me changed my perception of you.

ImmortalSinclair: Not quite the same.  *kisses your cheek*  Not to say you don't have a point, but I haven't known you as long as I've known her.

WereKarl: You've known my soul almost as long.  *points out*  But it still doesn't change who /she/ is.  She's still the same person.

ImmortalSinclair: Perhaps.  *quietly*  We'll see.

WereKarl: *looks at you, squeezing your fingers a little*  I'm sorry you had to find out that way, love.

ImmortalSinclair: So am I.  *small shrug*  We'll just have to tread carefully from here on out.  At least we know now...know what signs to look for.

WereKarl: Yeah, I guess.  *sighs, closing my eyes and leaning against you*  So, um...maybe we can...after Nicholas is settled...

ImmortalSinclair: Fuck Nicholas.  *kissing your forehead*  You were right about that.  Waiting for things to get settled won't solve anything. 

WereKarl: No, they won't.  *softly, curling into you*  But I shouldn't have pushed it like I did, shouldn't have pushed Ice.

ImmortalSinclair: *wrapping an arm around your waist, moving the kids to my other side so i can press close to you*  That's just how you are.  You see something you really want, you press on, full-steam, until you get it.  *smiles*  It's an admirable trait most of the time.

WereKarl: But not this time, right?  *faint smile, ducking my head under your chin so I can hear your heartbeat*

ImmortalSinclair: Perhaps not.  *nuzzling my cheek against the silk of your hair*  But I'm thankful you pressed, all the same.

WereKarl: *sighs, settling closer to you, one arm draping over your stomach*  I just wanted a child for us.

ImmortalSinclair: I know you do.  *kissing your hair*  But, it's a big step.  Our entire lives will change.  It will never be just about the two of us again.  You do realize this, yes?

WereKarl: I know.  I've thought about this a lot.  It's been about the two of us for six years.  *small shrug, nuzzling your neck*  Suppose it's no big deal if it's just us for a few more years or so.

ImmortalSinclair: Well, tell me what you thought about.

WereKarl: Just having a child.  *quietly, fingers toying with your shirt*  Someone to love and to love us, someone we can raise, teach things, show the world...see the world again through his or her eyes.

ImmortalSinclair: And you would prefer a biological child, yes?

WereKarl: Yes, but I'm not married to the idea.  *pauses, biting my lip*  It'll probably be easier for us to just adopt.

ImmortalSinclair: *tilting your head up*  You want a child of your own blood.  *quietly*

WereKarl: I already told you I did.  But so far that want has done nothing but cause stress for us.

ImmortalSinclair: You might want to get used to that.  *small smile*  Children are the most stressful things in the world.

WereKarl: I know, but it's a different type of stress.  *manages a small smile*

ImmortalSinclair: *nods*  *silent for a moment*  So, what would you like to do now?

WereKarl: I...  *stops, taking a deep breath, unsure of what exactly to tell you*  I'd still like to have a child.  But I'm willing to wait however long it takes to find someone acceptable to /both/ of us.

ImmortalSinclair: You honestly think we'll find someone better suited for us than Ice?  *softly*

WereKarl: *lifts my head to look at you*  Do you honestly expect me to believe that you'd support this and be part of it now if she was the mother?

ImmortalSinclair: She's still one of my best friends.  Godmother to most of my previous children.  I'm not going to dismiss that because she didn't trust me.

WereKarl: *hesitates before speaking very softly*  You ever think that maybe it wasn't lack of trust?

ImmortalSinclair: *looks down at you*  What do you think it was?

WereKarl: Well...do you think I didn't tell people about my condition because I didn't trust them?

ImmortalSinclair: You told me.  *softly reminding you*

WereKarl: Only you.  I didn't tell Craig until I was forced to.  But it wasn't because I didn't trust him.

ImmortalSinclair: Then why?

WereKarl: Because I was never comfortable with other people knowing about it.  I was ashamed of it.  *small voice*

ImmortalSinclair: Oh, Karl...*hugging you tightly*  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  You didn't choose this.  It doesn't make you any less.

WereKarl: I know that now.  *hugging you back, voice muffled because my face is pressed against your neck*  But at the time...I thought if I didn't tell anyone, they would treat me like a normal person.

ImmortalSinclair: What fun would that be?  *softly teasing, lips tracing your ear*

WereKarl: *smiles*  You know what I meant.  Maybe it was the same with Ice.

ImmortalSinclair: Maybe.  *settling back deeper in the cushions, bringing you with me*  Love you.

WereKarl: Love you, too.  *shifts around until I'm comfortable against you, your warmth seeping into me, relaxing me*  Sin...

ImmortalSinclair: Hmm?  *eyes closed, listening to your steady breathing*

WereKarl: *doesn't say anything for a moment, sorting out my thoughts before speaking*  I...I'm willing to take the risk.

ImmortalSinclair: You would?  *blinking slowly, gazing down at your upturned face*

WereKarl: If you were willing.  *nods, eyes locked with yours*  Yes.  Just as I'm willing to take the risk that any child of mine will be diabetic.

ImmortalSinclair: Alright.  *nodding, kissing your lips*  I'll talk to Ice.

WereKarl: Harry...is this what /you/ want?  *fingers graze your cheek, moving to trace your mouth*

ImmortalSinclair: How often have you ever known me to do what I *didn't* want? *licking at your fingers*

WereKarl: Not often.  *smiles, watching as you suck one finger into your mouth*  But this...I need to know that you're 100% behind it and you want it, for both of us.

ImmortalSinclair: I want it.  *softly, moving to your next finger, kissing it*  I want to raise another child with you.  *sucking the digit lightly* 

WereKarl: I'm glad.  Because I want that so much.  *soft smile, eyes going dark as you suck on my fingers*

ImmortalSinclair: I know.  *releasing your finger slowly*  I think you'll be a lovely father.

WereKarl: You really think so?  I'm a little nervous about the whole thing now.  *sliding my wet finger along your bottom lip, leaning up to kiss you softly*

ImmortalSinclair: Why's that?  *nibbling on your bottom lip*

WereKarl: Just...before it was just an idea, but now...it's a little more, isn't it?

ImmortalSinclair: *nods slowly*  Nothing is set in stone yet...but yeah.  It's more.  *pressing my lips to yours*

WereKarl: Good.  *whispers into the kiss, sliding my tongue over yours, one hand resting lightly on your chest*

ImmortalSinclair: *wrapping my hand around the back of your neck, opening my mouth wider, allowing you complete access, tongue playing with yours*

WereKarl: *explores your mouth thoroughly, taking my time, trading slow, wet kisses, loving the taste of you, the way your mouth feels on mine*

ImmortalSinclair: *relishing the honeyed taste of you on my tongue, lips sliding, moving in perfect synchronicity, fingers stroking your neck, loving the soft skin under my hands*

WereKarl: I love you.  *whispers against your lips, trailing my mouth across your jaw to your ear, hands sliding under your shirt to stroke warm skin*

ImmortalSinclair: I...*eyes fluttering shut* ...love you, too.  *head falling back, hand slipping under the collar of your shirt*

WereKarl: *kisses down your throat, hands stroking across your stomach and up your ribs, pausing to lick at the hollow of your throat*  Love the way you taste...  *slides my lips along your collarbone, stiffening as the tingle starts, taking a deep breath and holding it as I concentrate, forehead wrinkling with the effort to control the change*

ImmortalSinclair: *hands on your back stilling as you tense, eyes drifting open*  Karl, are... *drifting off, remembering what i just said* ...fuck...you alright?  *soothing hands on your back now*

WereKarl: *slowly opens my eyes, breathing deeply, smiling*  Yeah, I'm fine.  I think it gets easier to control each time you trigger it.

ImmortalSinclair: So, you're saying I should say it more.  *smiling back, inner sigh of relief when you relax under my hands*

WereKarl: Well, it's kinda nice to hear it.  *gives you a soft kiss, squirming a little to get comfortable again*

ImmortalSinclair: Nice to say it.  *hands sliding under your shirt again, running over muscle and skin*

WereKarl: Hope so.  *licks down your neck, resuming my exploration of your collarbone*

ImmortalSinclair: Always.  *soft sigh, tilting my head back*

WereKarl: *slowly unbuttons your shirt, sliding down to kiss and lick each inch of skin as it's exposed, loving the soft sounds you make for me*

ImmortalSinclair: *slipping your shirt over your head, sighing again at your lips on me, my hands running over you*

WereKarl: So beautiful...  *whispers against your sternum, pushing your shirt open as the last button slides free, hands roaming over your chest as I kiss a path down your stomach*

ImmortalSinclair: Yes...*looking down at you, hands fisted in your hair*  you are...

WereKarl: *smiles, tongue snaking out to swirl around your navel before dipping inside, hands drifting down to tease at your jeans*  So're you...

ImmortalSinclair: *lifting my hips, helping you take my jeans off*  You're arguing with me?  *groans when you lick across my inner thigh*

WereKarl: No...  *nips your inner thigh just hard enough to make you jump, soothing the spot with my tongue*  Just offering other viewpoints.

ImmortalSinclair: Alright.  *hands sliding through your hair again, cock twitching when you breathe across it, sensitive skin stretched to the breaking point*

WereKarl: *slides the flat of my tongue up your erection, watching your face as I swirl my tongue around the tip, hands cupping and squeezing your balls*

ImmortalSinclair: Karl... *breathy sigh, biting my bottom lip, lifting my hips, seeking the warmth of your mouth*

WereKarl: *smiles, deciding not to tease you this time, sucking on just the tip for a moment, hand curled around you, stroking as I take more of you in my mouth, tongue playing over warm flesh, loving the feel & taste of you, hard and heavy, in my mouth*

ImmortalSinclair: *moving slowly down your throat, taking my time--loving the way you swallow me, let me fill you, your tongue making me shiver, thighs clenched tight, body taut, groans spilling from my mouth in pleasure*

WereKarl: *hands slide over your thighs, stroking & kneading as I move, sucking just hard enough to hollow my cheeks, tongue constantly moving over you, eyes still on your face, wanting to watch as you come apart for me*

ImmortalSinclair: *feels the slide, the tug, abyss of pleasure pulling me under until all i'm aware of is you--your mouth, your tongue, your eyes on me...your name rolling off my tongue when i come, clutching your hair as i spill down your waiting throat*

WereKarl: *swallows greedily, not wanting to miss any of it, using my tongue to clean you in lazy swipes before crawling back up your body to kiss you*  God...I love how you look when you come...  *kisses you again*

ImmortalSinclair: *kisses you back, too breathless to respond, hands resting lightly on your hips*

WereKarl: *smiles, propping myself up on my elbows, hands cradling your face*  Have I mentioned lately how fucking lucky I am to have you?

ImmortalSinclair: Have I mentioned lately how lucky *I* am to have found you?  *leaning up to kiss you again*

WereKarl: Mmm...no, not lately.  But I'm always happy to have you demonstrate.  *grins, nipping at your bottom lip*

ImmortalSinclair: *wriggling out from under you, pulling you up with me*  Grab the kids.  *grins*  I'll be happy to demonstrate.

WereKarl: *eyes you, suddenly wary but picking up the kids, smiling when they let out sleepy squeaks*

ImmortalSinclair: I promise to go easy on you.  *winks, leading you upstairs*"

<font size=1>[this actually happened before Billy got his wings, but the mun is a forgetful idiot and forgot to post it!]</font>

sbl0mie: *ring! ring!*

WereKarl: *picks up the phone*  Hello?

sbl0mie: Hey, Karl! It's Dom!

WereKarl: *smiles*  Hey!  What's up?

sbl0mie: A helluva lot! *chuckles*

WereKarl: Really?  *curious*  So tell me about it.

sbl0mie: You know that bump on Billy's back I was telling you about?

WereKarl: Yeah.  Did he see Vig about it?

sbl0mie: Didn't get the chance to.

WereKarl: Oh?  Did it go away?

sbl0mie: No it ... *tangles finger in the phone cord* ... he, um ... he's got wings now.

WereKarl: He's got...what?  *blinks, sure I didn't hear you right*

sbl0mie: Wings. Billy has wings.

WereKarl: Wings.  Jesus, that's...  *trails off, unsure what to say*  Is he okay?

sbl0mie: I'm not sure. He's with Mark right now. Although ... I am a little worried about him.

WereKarl: I'm sure.  I'd be worried, too.

sbl0mie: They're gorgeous wings! I mean ... my god. They make him more wonderful to look at then he already is. *chuckles* But I'm scared that it may be a prelude of things to come.

WereKarl: What do you mean?  You think maybe he might...change more?

sbl0mie: Either that, or he'll go into the faerie realm again, or they'll take him away, or ... I dunno. Just something ...

WereKarl: So you think there's a chance he might leave you permanently?

sbl0mie: That fear is always with me. But whenever there's a full moon, or when something happens to him ... I worry more.

WereKarl: I can imagine.  I don't think he'll leave you voluntarily, though.  They'd have to force him to stay.

sbl0mie: I know. But that still scares me.

WereKarl: Well, you've got every right to be scared.  But you and Billy have some pretty powerful friends now.  *smiles*

sbl0mie: Yeah. We do. *smiles* And um ... thanks for that whole video camera idea ...

WereKarl: *laughs*  I thought that might have been the reason behind the cheesecake gift.

sbl0mie: Ohh yeah! *chuckles* Oh yeah! Seriously ... thanks!

WereKarl: You're very welcome.  *smiles*

sbl0mie: How's Harry doing?

WereKarl: He's doing better.  We had a long talk, got some things sorted out.  I think that, maybe, he's goiing to be okay.

sbl0mie: Thank god. I've been really worried about him. Hell, I'm worried about everyone and everything.

WereKarl: So have I.  But he seems to be better today.  He finally slept all night last night.  And he was actually hungry earlier, so that's a good sign.

sbl0mie: A very good sign.

WereKarl: Yeah.  *smiles*  It's going to take a while, but I think he's starting to heal finally.

sbl0mie: As long he's on the road to recovery, that's all that matters.

WereKarl: My thoughts exactly.  *soft laugh*  I can't wait to see his reaction when he finds out about Billy.

sbl0mie: About the wings you mean? *chuckles*

WereKarl: Yeah, about the wings.  The good thing is that this is most likely Billy's heritage coming out and not something worse.

sbl0mie: I sure hope so.

WereKarl: I think it is.  *nods*  I mean...why wings?  It doesn't make sense for it to be someone with an ulterior motive of some sort.

sbl0mie: Maybe he's becoming more faerie-like and less human ...

WereKarl: He'll always be Billy, though.  And he has you to anchor him.

sbl0mie: *smiles ewakly* I know. He thought I was going to leave him today.

WereKarl: *blinks*  Because he has wings?

sbl0mie: Exactly. Said he'd understand if I wanted to leave because things were getting too weird.

WereKarl: *sighs*  Sounds like Harry.  I hope you set him straight on that?

sbl0mie: Of course! I told him that I was going to slap him if he said anything like that again!

WereKarl: Good for you.  *chuckles*

sbl0mie: Oh, yes! I treat my man with such love! *laughs*

WereKarl: Don't feel bad, I do the same.  *laughs*

sbl0mie: They might gang up on us one of these days!

WereKarl: Yeah, like that's going to happen.  We know their weaknesses.  *grins*

sbl0mie: Cheesecake?

sbl0mie: It's cheesecake, isn't it!?

WereKarl: Well, you tell me.  *laughs*  Harry's got several.  I'm sure Billy has more than just cheesecake.

sbl0mie: Oh, yes! Many more!

sbl0mie: *laughs*

WereKarl: Well, there you go then.  *chuckles*

sbl0mie: Hey, can I ask you something? And you can say no if you want.

WereKarl: Sure, you can ask me anything you like.  Won't swear I'll answer, but you can ask.

sbl0mie: Yay! Well, anyway, I know you're cooking for the ceremony and everything, and I love you for it! But, I was just wondering, would you, um, like to be my best man?

WereKarl: Me?  *startled, blinking*  Wow...I'm honored, Dom.  I'd love to.

sbl0mie: Really?

WereKarl: Yeah.  *smiles*  I'm not doing the actual cooking.  Several of the guys from the restaurant will be doing that.  I'm just organizing the menu and things, so I'll have plenty of time.

sbl0mie: Oh, thank you so much, Karl!!

WereKarl: You're very welcome.  I'm flattered that you asked me.

sbl0mie: I'm flattered that you said yes!

WereKarl: Like I'd say no.  It's an honor.  *smiles*

sbl0mie: Yay! *chuckles*
sbl0mie: Thank you!

WereKarl: You're welcome.  Who knows...maybe one day Harry and I will actually commit to a legal ceremony and you can return the favor.

sbl0mie: I'll be first in line! Ya know ... since you're my best man, I get to decide what you wear ... *smirks*

WereKarl: Oh god....you're going to make me wear a kilt, aren't you?  *laughs*

sbl0mie: I may. *laughs* Think of what Harry will like!

WereKarl: Hmmm...  *ponders that for a second*  I assume I can wear it the traditional way, just like a true Scotsman?

sbl0mie: Only if you enjoy scratching your crotch every two minutes.

WereKarl: *laughs*  You're talking to someone who's made a career of spending months in place where running water is a myth.  I doubt a kilt will give me much trouble for a few hours.

sbl0mie: That's what I thought too! But man .. it chaffes like hell!

WereKarl: Maybe I'll have mine lined in silk then.  *chuckles*

sbl0mie: Rowr! Sexy!
sbl0mie: *laughs*

WereKarl: I'm sure Harry will think so.  *smirks*

sbl0mie: I'm not wearing a kilt though ... so you don't have to! *laughs*

WereKarl: We'll see.  Maybe we can line yours in silk, too, so it doesn't chafe.  *laughs*  Think how pleased Billy would be.

sbl0mie: Hmm ... I could ...
sbl0mie: But I won't. *laughs*

WereKarl: *laughs with you*  Nothing wrong with that.

sbl0mie: Of course not! It's cold in Scotland!

WereKarl: True.  Though I'm sure Billy would be willing to keep you warm.  *laughs*

sbl0mie: *laughs* Billy's wearing a kilt.

WereKarl: I'd be disappointed if he didn't

sbl0mie: I would be too!

WereKarl: *chuckles*  We'll have to make sure that plenty of photos get taken.

sbl0mie: Oh, yes! LOTS of photos!

WereKarl: Definitely.  *grins*

sbl0mie: Will Harry be wearing a kilt?

WereKarl: He might.  I'm not sure

sbl0mie: I'm not going to  have to hold you back, am I? *laughs*

WereKarl: Nah, I can control myself.  *laughs*  For a little while.

sbl0mie: Will I lose sight of you at the reception? *smirks*

WereKarl: You might.  *grins*  But we'll at least stay for the cake cutting.

sbl0mie: Great! Everyone loves wedding cake!

WereKarl: Yes, they do.  And your's will be exceptional.

sbl0mie: Yay! Exceptional cake!

WereKarl: Any idea what flavor you'd like?

sbl0mie: What do I have to choose from?

WereKarl: Any that you'd like.  I can make pretty much anything, so can the chefs at the restaurant.

sbl0mie: Angelfood cake?

WereKarl: We can do that.  One of my favorites, actually.  *smiles*

sbl0mie: Really? Billy's too!

WereKarl: See, I knew Billy and I had a lot in common!  *laughs*

sbl0mie: Don't tell me you have wings too! *laughs*

WereKarl: No, just fangs and claws sometimes.  *laughs*

sbl0mie: *chuckles a little*

WereKarl: Makes things interesting at times.

sbl0mie: When was the last time you changed?

WereKarl: When Harry and I were in Greece.  He figured out what the trigger was and we've avoided it ever since then.  But...I can keep myself from changing now, thanks to Hugo.

sbl0mie: That's good. Cats generally don't like me.

WereKarl: Really?  Well, I like you just fine.  *smiles*

sbl0mie: Horrah! But yeah, they hiss at me. I think they're just jealous.

WereKarl: Could be.  *soft laugh*  Perhaps we'll see next time I change.  You can come 'round and scratch my belly for me.

sbl0mie: Aww! Okay! I'll bring catnip for you!

WereKarl: You sure you want to do that?  *chuckles*  I'm a pretty big cat when I change.

sbl0mie: Umm ... I'll bring you a ball of twine?

WereKarl: We'll figure something out.  *smiles*

sbl0mie: *laughs* Most likely.

WereKarl: I know Billy offered to come talk to me next time I changed.  Bit frustrating to not be able to communicate.

sbl0mie: That would be frustrating.

WereKarl: It's very frustrating.  Liv can talk to me in that form, and Billy was thinking he might be able to as well.

sbl0mie: Well, at least it hasn't happened in a while.

WereKarl: Which is a good thing.  Not exactly the most comfortable feeling in the world.

sbl0mie: I'll bet it's not.

WereKarl: It's better now.  Vig made a potion that helped a lot with it.

sbl0mie: That's good. The changing must've been painful.

WereKarl: Very painful.  It seems to be a little easier each time I change, though.

sbl0mie: I guess you just get used to it. It's probably like what Billy went through this morning.

WereKarl: Yeah, if that was anything at all like my changes...I imagine he was exhausted afterwards.

sbl0mie: He was. Very. I had no idea what was going on.

WereKarl: Sounds about like Harry the first time I changed.  *pauses, thinking*  Perhaps...do you think the wings are here permanently?  Or maybe they'll come and go, much like my changes?

sbl0mie: I'm not sure. I'd have to talk to Billy about that.

WereKarl: It's something to think about.  Gonna make things difficult if he's got them permanently.

sbl0mie: I'm sure we'll figure out something.

WereKarl: I'm sure you will.  Like I said, you've got a lot of powerful friends now.

sbl0mie: God, my life was so boring last year! *laughs*

WereKarl: Mine was too, mate.  *chuckles*

sbl0mie: *smiles* Well, I should let you go. My bed is looking rather comfy.

WereKarl: So is mine.  *smiles*  And I've still got a few things to do yet.

sbl0mie: *laughs* All right! Thanks again, mate!

WereKarl: Anytime, Dom.  Talk to you later.

sbl0mie: Ta ta!
sbl0mie: *hangs up*"

"event","We're back.  After a week in Paris that was actually relaxing, followed by an extremely long flight, we're home again.  Harry's slowly getting better...I think spending the week there, taking care of things like he did, was what he needed to finally come to terms with the fact that Marton's gone and won't be coming back.  I wish things were different, but...wishing won't change things now.

Anyway, we're home. I should probably check in with some people, find out what's been happening this past week. I still owe Lawrence a shopping date. :grins: And I should go talk to Hugo so he doesn't worry about us. Not that I think he will. :winks: Wonder if I can catch him at Burn tonight...."

[private convo that happens late the first evening in Paris]

BladesNo1fan: *ring ring*

WereKarl: *slowly wakes up from dozing on the sofa, reaching for my cellphone, wondering who's calling*  Hello?

BladesNo1fan: Karl, hey it's Sean. I tried calling Harry but he's got his phone off.

WereKarl: *pushes myself up, glancing over at Harry, sleeping on the sofa beside me*  Hey, Sean.  *softly*  He turned his phone off before we left home.

BladesNo1fan: You've left home. Where you gone?

WereKarl: We're in Paris.

BladesNo1fan: Oh, bullocks. Nevermind then. I was gonna ask a favour but.......why you in Paris?

WereKarl: Harry has some things to take care of here.  *another glance for him, smiling as he shifts in his sleep*  I came along for moral support.

BladesNo1fan: Is he killing Nicky? Cause you know I wanted to come help him with that! He might need me for back-up.

WereKarl: *sighs, rubbing my eyes*  Sean...again, he's /not/ going to take you along when he goes after Nicholas.  And he definitely won't need any back-up.  And no, that's not why he's here.

BladesNo1fan: Oh is he doing hitman stuff? Cause I bet he's a contract killer ain't he?  That's soooo cool. No hold on I'm going off the point of me ringing here. When are you coming back?

WereKarl: *blinks, trying to sort out your babbling*  No, he's not doing hitman stuff.  No, he's not a contract killer.  Where do you come up with these ideas?  *shakes my head*  Nevermind, don't answer that.  We'll be back in about 9 days or so.

BladesNo1fan: How do I come up with any of my ideas? Now that's the question and nine days?! I need him to help me find Liv!

WereKarl: What?  *feels the beginnings of a stress headache*  Find Liv?  What on earth are you talking about?

BladesNo1fan: Well I was kinda thinking out of everyone he'd understand what I'm going through cause he's been a father so many time ya know? And he's got better powers than me and shit.

WereKarl: Sean...  *slowly, gritting my teeth*  What.  Are.  You.  Talking.  About?

BladesNo1fan: Liv. Being. In. The. Ocean. Now I can swim but not THAT well. And I haven't heard anything from her in five days so I'm thinking when she said forever she meant it. I love Kyra and she's not gonna take her away from me like this.

WereKarl: Sean...Liv goes into the ocean all the time.  She'll return when she's ready.

BladesNo1fan: No but she said she was going in forever, as in not coming back. And she hasn't got in contact with anyone. I hate it, I feel so lost.

WereKarl: I...Sean, Liv sometimes loses track of time when she goes deep.  *softly, memories of former lives with children flitting through my mind*  I'm sure she'll bring Kyra back to you soon.

BladesNo1fan: Karl........you know what happened Sunday night don't you?

WereKarl: *rakes a hand through my hair, settling back against Harry's side*  Sunday night...I wasn't really paying much attention to anything but Harry.  He wasn't doing so well that night.

BladesNo1fan: Has no-one told you? Have you not spoken to Craig? Have......*goes quiet* Oooooooooh so THAT'S why you and Harry haven't called! Excuse me I need to faint.

WereKarl: *pulls the phone away and stares at it, giving up trying to figure out how your mind works*  What's why Harry and I haven't called?  And no, I haven't had a chance to speak to Craig yet.

BladesNo1fan: Well......*sighs* Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin. Liv kinda overheard me say to Mark that Cate was my girlfriend. She stormed out. Craig and Orli and I think Atti were talking to her. She said she was going into the ocean and not coming back and she has. Then Craig and Orli come back in. And I get yelled at by certain people for being a selfish immature whatever for making Liv disappear. When really Liv has kidnapped my child and isn't letting me see her just cause I tried to move on with my life! *takes a deep breath* The end.

WereKarl: *blinks*  I...and you think that's why Harry and I haven't called?  *trying to sort out everything you said and make some sense of it*

BladesNo1fan: Well some people hate me. I thought maybe.......I don't know. Maybe you'd had enough.

WereKarl: Sean, neither of us had any clue that Liv had left.  Harry's still not feeling very sociable, and I've been focused on him.

BladesNo1fan: Well I know that now. Wish I knew it the other day though, I was so depressed cause you and him hadn't called to see how I was coping. I feel stupid now.

WereKarl: You should have called.  *softly, rubbing Harry's leg as he shifts & murmurs in his sleep*  I'm sure Liv will be back before Kyra's born.

BladesNo1fan: But she might already be born. She was having contraction although she's not meant to be due until the end of November.

WereKarl: I know Liv, Sean.  She would have let someone know if Kyra had been born.

BladesNo1fan: *sighs* Well if you know Liv then tell me why she's putting me through this? I know I'm a wanker but......this is really cruel. She knows how much Kyra means to me.

WereKarl: *pauses, not wanting to be dragged into the middle of this*  Did she know about you and Cate before the party?  Or did she find out then, along with everyone else there?

BladesNo1fan: Well I only started going out with Cate the day before the party. Some people knew I liked her before then. Look I understand she's be pissed off but she can't take Kyra away from me cause of it.

WereKarl: Unfortunately, Sean, she's Kyra's mother and the two of you were never married.  *softly, not wanting to upset you*  She can do pretty much what she wants unless a court tells her she can't.  It sucks, but that's how it is.

BladesNo1fan: But I can't go to court cause she's in the middle of the ocean! If I could then they'd give me some custody. It's not fair, I want my baby.

WereKarl: Mate....they might not give you custody.  It doesn't always work like that.  *sighs, trying to figure out when everything seemed to fall apart back home*  And I know you miss Kyra and want her.  But all you can do is wait for Liv to come back.

BladesNo1fan: She said she's not coming back and I would get custody. Liv has kidnapped her, it's against the law, fathers do have rights...........don't they?

WereKarl: Um...Sean...listen...Kyra isn't born yet.  And unless you had custody to begin with or some sort of papers from the courts, it's not kidnapping.  Liv is legally entitled to take Kyra wherever she pleases.  Yes, fathers have rights.  But mothers have more.  Especially when the fathers have the disadvantages that you have.

BladesNo1fan: Well that sucks! I'm trying so hard to be good. I'm going to college, I haven't got into any fights and I've calmed down and this is what I get. Liv taking my child away cause she can as she don't have a dick. If I did that you'd be mad wouldn't you? But cause it's Liv taking Kyra away from me you don't even care.

WereKarl: Don't you dare accuse me of not caring.  *grits my teeth, trying to remain calm*  I'm simply explaining how things work in a way that you might understand.  And I never said that I wasn't mad that Liv took Kyra.  I simply said that it's her right as the mother because Kyra isn't born yet.

BladesNo1fan: But she might be born. *goes quiet for a while* I want to be a father to her. She's a human not a fish. I want her to go to school and have a family and have a proper life. I want to look after her. 

WereKarl: Sean, she's half fish.  And I know you want to do all those things for her.  Believe me, I understand.  But you have to understand that you might not be able to do all that.

BladesNo1fan: No she's human. She has some water powers but she's human. And why can't I do that? Please Karl, I'm so lost and depressed, I don't know what to do.

WereKarl: Liv's her mother.  That makes her half fish.  *faintly amused*  Just like you being her father makes her half wolf in a way.  *smiles fades*  You might not be able to do those things because the courts might not let you.  Or, worse case scenario, Liv may never return.  It's as simple as that.

BladesNo1fan: I know I'm stupid but I'm pretty sure the courts would be on my side about the whole living in an ocean thing. And what would you think if Liv never returns?

WereKarl: Sean...Liv knows about what happened...before.  And I know that wasn't your fault, but the courts might not see it that way.  Do you understand?  *pauses, hoping you do*  And if Liv never returns...I don't know what I'll think, honestly.

BladesNo1fan: Y....you think she'd tell them about that? I'd be locked up! I'd go to jail. No..........even Liv wouldn't.......no.

WereKarl: I'm not saying she would or she wouldn't.  But it's something you have to think about.  *quietly, curling against Harry*  I don't think you'd go to jail.  It was an accident.

BladesNo1fan: Well maybe but telling them I'm a werewolf would either get Liv locked up for being looney or me locked up for being a werewolf. I can't believe I'm talking to you, you're making me ever more depressed.

WereKarl: Sean, it's not illegal to be a werewolf.  And trust me...no one would lock Liv up for saying you were one.  Haven't you noticed how open everyone is about things like that?  *stifles a yawn*  And I'm sorry I'm depressing you.  But you need to look at things realistically for once.  Just because you want things to happen a certain way doesn't mean they will.

BladesNo1fan: I want my child. I'm not letting this one be taken away from me. And if you're not gonna help me then fine but I'm still going to ask Harry what I was going to ask him before. She has no right to do this to me, it's wrong and selfish and cruel. Kyra loves me, I know she wouldn't want to be away from me. I'm so depressed you don't seem to understand. 

WereKarl: *takes a deep breath*  Do you have any idea how many memories are in my head of having children and losing them?  Until you do, don't assume I don't understand how you feel.  *takes another breath, softening my voice, not wanting to wake Harry*  And if you're going to ask Harry to take Kyra away from Liv for you, don't.  He doesn't need that right now, and I seriously doubt he'll do it unless Liv is endangering Kyra.

BladesNo1fan: Then I'm very confused as why you have no sympathy for me. And let Harry decide that for himself. I'll leave you to your important life. Bye.

WereKarl: Sean, I never once said I had no sympathy for you.  I do.  But I'm warning you.  Do not ask Harry to take a child away from her mother.  He does NOT need that right now.

BladesNo1fan: *sighs* Ok. I won't...........take care.

WereKarl: Listen...I'm sorry this happened.  But there's not really anything any of us can do unless Liv decides to return.  Mark would have a better chance of finding her than Harry.

BladesNo1fan: *quietly* I'll ask him then. Thanks.

WereKarl: You're welcome.  *just as quietly*  Sean...you do understand why I'm asking you not to drag Harry into this to take Kyra from Liv, don't you?  He's just started to accept Marton's death and grieve.  He doesn't need something like this to deal with as well right now.

BladesNo1fan: I won't Karl. I'll look elsewhere. I'm sorry.

WereKarl: No need to apologize.  I just...I want him to heal as much as he can without adding more things to the process.  He has enough on his mind with Marton being gone and finding out that Nicholas is his son.

BladesNo1fan: Nicky is his son?! I'M his son! I mean.........really?

WereKarl: *very soft growl*  Sean...you are not his son.  And I know Harry's asked you to stop referring to him as your father.  *takes a deep breath, then another*  And yes, really.  Apparently Nicholas is one of Harry's sons.  *refrains from mentioning that, in a way, he's also my son*

BladesNo1fan: *ignores the first part* Ooooooh. So he has to kill his own...........shit. Hmmmm that's tough.

WereKarl: Exactly.  NOW do you understand why I don't want you dragging him into this mess between you and Liv?

BladesNo1fan: Yeah I do. I won't ask him I promise.

WereKarl: Thank you.

BladesNo1fan: No problem. Now I have to go and see Cate. Be nice to the French people.

WereKarl: *soft laugh*  I think they'll have more to worry about from Harry then they do from me.  I'm just here to hold his hand and see the city.

BladesNo1fan: Well enjoy the city. First place I went to when I left home that was. Kinda handy being right next-door to England.

WereKarl: Yeah, I can see how it would be.  *smiles, closing my eyes and curling closer to Harry*  Take care, Sean.

BladesNo1fan: I'll try to. Bye bye *puts phone down*

WereKarl: *turns off the phone and drops it on the table before sliding back into a doze*"

"event","I made a pan of brownies. My own recipe, with plenty of extra chocolate in them. Harry always likes them, fresh out of the oven, almost too hot to eat. Maybe they'll tempt him to eat. God knows he hasn't been doing much of that since...well, since Marton died. And last night scared the fuck out of me.

:sits at the kitchen table, staring at the pan of brownies, still steaming as they've only been out of the oven a few minutes:

God...I probably shouldn't have made 'em. Chocolate's my weak point...even more so than normal sweets...

:chews bottom lip, still staring at the pan:

Though one won't hurt."

Got a call this morning. Apparently, my fuckwit assistant has lined up another dig for us. And we're scheduled to leave on Tuesday. Um...no. Just fucking no. I'm not doing it. There is no way in hell I'm leaving Harry for 3 months right now. It's not going to happen. And I told them that. Apparently, 'no' is an alien word to them because they just kept fucking going on about it until I finally got pissed and yelled. That shut 'em up real fast. I don't need this shit right now.

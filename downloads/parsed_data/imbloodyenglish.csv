Yeah... got my divorce, kicked his ass&nbsp;in court, woo hoo!&nbsp;&nbsp;6 months before I got it, my first ever boyfriend (from high school) found me on FB and woo'd me back into his life.&nbsp; And here I said &quot;never again&quot;... it's that damnable Italian charm I tell you!"

Still not officially divorced (boo), still no job as of yet (boo), found that facebook is addicting (boo, er, yay), only done some writing here and there becaaaaaaaaaaause I decided to go back to college and we all know how homework can be consuming.  Classes are going well though, straight A's so far.  May as well say thanks to Carrie for turning me onto dramione for new reading material - you evil gal you - but spuffy is still my fav... snickers."

"event","Hmmm, well, where to begin.  I got what I wanted out of my petition for temporary relief, so at least that means more money in my bank account from my soon to be ex - so YAY.  My kids are doing REALLY well.  They're very accepting of what's going on and I think the counseling they are recieving is doing wonders.

About 2 weeks ago, I thought to myself... self, it's time to go back to college and get your bachelors, cuz just having an associates isn't cutting it.  So I filled out the multitude of paperwork required by the University I chose and I start classes in January - YAY again, go me, LOL.  Forensic Psychology with a concentration in criminology - now THAT'S fascinating to me and has a multitude of possible career opportunities - ok, maybe after I get my MA thru the same place so I can get more specific - but I'm UBER excited about it all.

The only thing I'm in desperate need of now is a job, and I swear... the second I get medical and dental insurance kicking in from whatever job I get - I'm going ahead and divorcing poopstain the very next day.  I mean, why drag it out?  I don't want to be married to him for another second anymore than he wants to be married to me.  Plus, if I can find a job closer to where I come from (after the school year of course), I can move back to the north-east coast (tri-state and/or surrounding area) and finally be happy and closer to my family.  Living out here in Illinois isn't bad, but I have no family here so it kinda sucks.

Oh - on the note of job hunting, I have a request... if there is anyone out there who is an expert at putting together a resume, please contact me???  Pretty please?  I have most of it put together, but the truth is - after being a stay at home mom for 6 years - I'm a wee bit rusty at that sort of thing.  You can email me directly at  tina_trammel@yahoo.com  and thanks a mil if there's anyone out there willing to help.

Special thanks to my dear friend Carrie - Darkrivertempest - for having me in her home whilst he-who-shall-not-be-named came to my home to visit his children.  She and I had a BLAST.  Thank you boo - smooches."

"event","Though I rarely update my journal - bad Tina - I feel so good this week I just had to.  I finally took back some of my own where my husband is concerned.  So far, he's 'dictated' to me he wants no part of being married anymore, he's putting our children and myself on a monthly allowance of a meager amount while he's deployed, and that this divorce will go 'his way' and ""this is how everything will work from now on...""  

Patronizing?  Yes, it is.  But at least he's dumber than even I gave him credit for.  He got served a standard petition for divorce and an emergency petition for temporary relief this week from my lawyer and is now flailing about, angry, sending me hateful, accusational emails and basically having a hissy fit.  Clearly he doesn't understand legal-ese speak and what those petitions really mean, but I'm not the one required to explain it to him - I'm merely giving him what he wants... a divorce.  

True, I never told him I had a lawyer, (chuckles to self), but it amazes me he never thought I would try and protect myself legally.  The fact is, whenever there is children and/or property involved, there's no way anyone can have a divorce without a lawyer.  So when he cried, ""how could I do this"", I had to laugh at my first small victory in this mess he created because hey - I wanted to stay married and work this out, he's the one that can't be bothered.  

Call me callous if you want, but there is something supremely satisfying that he is now the one scared and angry while I've moved well beyond that phase.  I'm borrowing a friend's qoute here when I say I'm so far out of his emotional reach, he'd need a passport and vaccinations to get to me.  His ignorance has become my bliss if only for this week... at least until he gets a lawyer of his own.  And I really hope he does, that way I won't have to deal with him and our lawyers can hash everything out.  So despite the fact I still have many ups and downs to go through until everything is final, this is one... good... week!!!"

Something has recently happened in my life that is too difficult for me to cope with right now and I need to take some time off from writing and TSR until I can get back on my feet.  I feel bad for going on hiatus like this, but I wouldn't unless it weren't absoloutely necessary.  I can't say when I'll return, but rest assured I will, I hate unfinished wips with a passion, lol.  So all I ask is to please be patient with me and I'll be back as soon as I can.

I met so many of you amazing people I've only known in cyber space and I guess meeting James for the first time was more of a bonus really.  Sevvy, prophecygirl, clawofcat, beanbeans, Lostboy, a bunch of hysterical ladies from England (Marsters Mobsters), Nos from Marsters Sanctuary, Ladyhawk, I could go on and on there were so many of you.  Thanks so much for one of the most amazingly fun weekends I've ever had... you guys rock!!!  I think my muse enjoyed himself as well.  If James ever comes near St Louis, everyone is invited to stay at my new house - it's huge and I have plenty of space.  Especially my new friends Jude and Mary from England who were a hoot to party with till 4AM.  Gotta say, even Voltaire was quite a cutie and so much fun to have a piccie taken with, *le pant, le sigh, le heave*.

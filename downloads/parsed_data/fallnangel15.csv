"event","I had my first checkup, to clear me for driving and to take off the tape that was covering my incision.  They had taken my staples out before I left the hospital, and instead had these tape strips covering it.  My blood pressure is back to normal (yay!) and now I've got no tape holding me together.  I'm allowed to drive, but not go back to work yet.  That may come in 2 weeks.  

As for Jack... well, the boy's being a bit feisty.  He pulled his ventilator tube out, so they've got him on something called a cpap-- it's a nose tube type thing.  Also, his IV came out last night, and since he was just on minimal fluids and is taking his feedings well, they're leaving it out for now.  He's up to 15ccs every 3 hours for feedings, so that's really great.  He's gained some weight and is now at 2 pounds 6.5 ounces. His lungs are having some problems, though, because they're still too immature.  He's got a lot of fluids in his lungs, so they've got him on decadron and lasix, to help him out."

"event","Good morning ladies and gents.   It's been a few days, and there's been a really good reason.  
I've been in the hospital giving birth to my son, 3 months early.  

Friday night I was up all night vomiting, not able to keep water down.  I thought that I had a stomach virus, or something.  So I called the doctor in the morning, and she suggested i come to the hospital, where she was doing rounds, and she'd check me.  She thought I had the flu, too.  I called my mom to get her to drive me, when I started going blind.  This was really scary, by the end, when my mom came, i was having long moments of blindness and disorientation.  I didn't know what room I was in, or where I was, but i tried to hide it from my mom.  I attributed that to not being able to eat for awhile and all the vomiting.  I got to the hospital, I was fully blind. They sent me in for a urine test and that's when the seizures that i had been getting (the reason I was disoriented) went full on.   i don't remember a big chunk from there, but apparently they dragged me out of the bathroom, got me on a table and were trying desperately to stabilize me for awhile. From my point of view, I was giving the sample, and all of a sudden I was laying on a table with what seemed like a million people around me, all poking, jabbing, or asking questions.  I stabilized though, and the spouse got there, and they took me into surgery.  They had to take my son at 27 weeks, because I had full on eclampsia.  So i was right about my previous diagnosis that they ignored me on.  But, he's alive, and he's beautiful, and his dad and I adore him more than I ever thought it possible.  I got released from the hospital yesterday, but there's stil a bunch of healing to do.  C section cuts are VERY inconvenient for moevement, let me just say.  But back to my baby.  :)  (My favorite, and most heartbreaking subject right now)... He's doing well, he's in an incubator in the nicu (neonatal intensive care unit)... he's not going to be out for awhile, since he was so early, so if anyone wants to guess where I'll be in my free time from now until Thanksgiving, I'll give them an extra hint and point at the hospital.  He's absolutely beautiful, though.  I'll be posting pictures when I can get them scanned in.  I'm also making up a website for him, so that friends and family can just click on and see him and see how he's doing.   Last night was a really great night for him -- they put him on the same air mix that we use (usually it's higher, makes it easier for them to get what they need out of it), and he was off what I call the glow-light, which was nice, because we got to watch him without the little eye mask on.  He opened his eyes yesterday and we got a beautiful picture of his face. :)  I also have to laugh and admit we got a picture of them changing his diaper, too. (yes, he is a boy!:))  

It's hard, it really is... I'm so overwhelmed by emotions at this point.. it kills me to know my baby's not with me all the time, it's hard being able to look at him and not hold him yet... it's hard loving something this much.  I never knew just to what extent I'd feel this"

Your Eyes
As We Said Our Goodbyes
Can't Get Them Out Of My Mind
And I Find I Can't Hide (From)
Your Eyes
The Ones That Took Me By Surprise
The Night You Came Into My Life
Where There's Moonlight
I See Your Eyes

How'd I Let You Slip Away
When I'm Longing So To Hold You
Now I'd Die For One More Day
'Cause There's Something I Should
Have Told You
Yes There's Something I Should Have
Told You

When I Looked Into Your Eyes
Why Does Distance Make Us Wise?
You Were The Song All Along
And Before The Song Dies

I Should Tell You I Should Tell You
I Have Always Loved You
You Can See It In My Eyes

Take me down, 6 underground,
The ground beneath your feet,
Laid out low, nothing to go
Nowhere a way to meet
I've got a head full of drought,
Down here, so faroff losing out
Round here,

Overground, watch this space,
I'm open to falling from grace

Calm me down, bring it round
Too way high off your street
I can see like nothing else
In me you're better than I wannabe
Don't think 'cos I understand,
I care, don't think 'cos I'm talking we're friends,

Overground, watch this space,
I'm open to falling from grace

Talk me down, safe and sound
Too strung up to sleep
Wear me out, scream and shout
Swear my time's never cheap
I fake my life like I've lived
Too much, I take whatever you're given
Not enough,

Overground, watch this space,
I'm open

I fake my life like I've lived
Too much, I take whatever you're given
Not enough,

Overground, watch this space,
I'm open to falling from grace

Two Rules:

1. The person must be in the movies or on TV (but doesn't have to be an actor/actress). The person can be specific to a role (e.g. Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennet) or just the person themself.

2. You have to post a link to a picture of said person (or their defining 'ass'ets) in the comments."

"event","Subject: O'Connor is retiring. Take action to protect our rights.

Hi,

As you probably heard, Sandra Day O'Connor just resigned from the Supreme Court. This is an extremely important time for our senators to hear from us. They need to know that we are counting on them to stand up to President Bush and protect our rights -- because with a moderate like O'Connor stepping down and a far-right like Bush making the nomination, well, the stakes couldn't be higher. The Terri Schiavo tragedy showed us all just how far these people are willing to go.

MoveOn PAC has already started an emergency petition, and we're looking to get 250,000 signatures and comments to the Senate before Tuesday -- which is when rumor has it Bush will announce his nomination.

I hope you can take a minute to join me in signing this petition, so our senators know that, in what might be the fight of our lives, we need them to do what it takes to protect our rights.

http://www.moveonpac.org/protectourrights

Thanks!"

I look terrible in pictures.  Of course, that probably means somethign about real life, but I prefer to just blame it on the pictures.:)  Anyway, I got shepherded into this room, and they were like, take off your badge, take a picture.  So... I did. I'll post it if I get a copy of it.  I've never actually seen American Idol, but it was still kinda cool."

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/K/Koshari/1072669473_otTheDevil.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""The Devil Card""><br>You are the Devil card. The Devil is based on the<br>figure Pan, Lord of the Dance. The earthy<br>physicality of the devil breeds lust. The<br>devil's call to return to primal instincts<br>often creates conflict in a society in which<br>many of these instincts must be kept under<br>control. Challenges posed by our physical<br>bodies can be overcome by strength in the<br>mental, emotional, and spiritual realms. Pan is<br>also a symbol of enjoyment and rules our<br>material creativity. The devil knows physical<br>pleasure and how to manipulate the physical<br>world. Material creativity finds its output in<br>such things as dance, pottery, gardening, and<br>sex. The self-actualized person is able to<br>accept the sensuality and usefulness of the<br>devil's gifts while remaining in control of any<br>darker urges.

"event","I should've known that our friendship was doomed from the start.&nbsp; Although it seemed as though we had a lot in common, we were as different as a hummus pita pocket and a ham n roast beef sammich.&nbsp; Ok, probably a bit more alike than that, but you get the idea.&nbsp; It seemed like a grand idea, and we even looked a lot alike, too, which made it seem as though we definitely should've been friends, when everyone thought we were related anyway.&nbsp; 

Bad idea.

I realized today what the problem was, and that we should've seen it from the start.&nbsp; I realized how obvious it was that we were two people from totally different planets, as it were.&nbsp; I discovered it as I was thinking about our role models.&nbsp; She idolized Audrey Hepburn. Me?&nbsp; I want to be like Angelina Jolie when I grow up.&nbsp; She wanted that grace, beauty, style.&nbsp; I want that oozing sexuality, wit, and confidence.&nbsp; She wants to be charming, I want to be a badass.&nbsp; In reality, I'm probably more charming than it sounds... I mean, I don't (usually) burp loud enough to silence a restaurant, and I know my pleases and thank yous.&nbsp; But if I had a choice of whose body I could step into... Angelina, baby, all the way.&nbsp; Well, she's the one that I bring up, because she's pretty much the embodiment of what I'd like to be.&nbsp; Eliza Dushku, Angelina Jolie, Jessia Biel in trinity (I have to specify with her, she's not always the badass)... those are who I look up to.&nbsp; Those are the people I wish I were like.&nbsp; I want to be that kind of girl.&nbsp; In reality, I'm not so much, but I like to think I have the heart of a badass girl.&nbsp; It just doesn't show on the outside.&nbsp; But I digress.&nbsp; 

That is why I'm going to have to make it a point to check with all my friends about who they look up to, want to be like, etc.&nbsp; I can't have another Audrey Hepburn debacle on my hands now, can I?"

In the parking office today.  Most people are off, so it's rather slow.  I'd say to please call me and ease my pain, but really, I can't just go posting my work number all willy-nilly and such.  Not to mention I doubt I'd get any responses, heh.  Anyway, on the off chance that anyone would want to, let me know, i'll send it in a not so willy nilly post.  

I think I need some more caffeine, but I'm a bit afraid of soda right now.  I od'd on water yesterday and the day before, and the mixture of greasy food and a body unused to so much water got me in pain curled up begging for the pepto bottle last night.  It was a rough night, I woke up like 8 times.  I'm better now, but I'm just trying to be careful, and still maintain the increased water intake. 

i want to do something fun soon.  Something out of the ordinary.  Maybe fingerpainting, maybe a theme park, I'm really not sure.  I just need to do *something.*  I want to go to Rolling Thunder this weekend, in DC, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it or not.  I'm going to try.  I figure I get free parking on the weekends from my job, I may be able to take advantage of it.  We'll see.

"event","Bits of randomness:

I had a salad today... but it had seafood on top of it, so that by the time I got to the actual salad, I was full.  Sooo.... lunch for tomorrow, I think, if it's not funky by that time.

I have these little guys sitting on my desk, they're kind of like dart-men, only with sticky squishy, wall-walker heads instead of dart heads.  They're fun, I toss them at my monitor sometimes when I'm trying extra hard to ignore my friendly neighborhood LB. 

I have a beanie dino that my mom gave to me that one of the night guys dressed up like a biker.  He's big fun. :)

I have 26 minutes left of work to live through, but I'm feeling considerably less than motivated. Such lack of motivation is not helped by the fact that I just finished a mountain dew and some sour patch blue raspberries. MMMM!!

My grandmother thinks I'm a devout catholic.  I was raised catholic, and although I don't lie to her, I don't just smack her in the face with the fact that perhaps I'm not nearly as catholic (ok, not at all) as she hoped and dreamed.

I wrote a 2 page story today, only to be completely disgusted with it.  It got deleted before it made me even more queasy.  At least something's going on in my brain though, right?

I really like the fact that I work in DC, because even though I don't generally do anything in dc, it just makes me feel closer to everything, and more connected.  Now I actually have to *get* more connected with everything... that's the challenge.  At least the walks around the tidal basin kind of keep me seeing things. 

I saw Team America the other night.  2 words: Puppet sex.

I keep injuring myself with my nails.  I'm not used to them being long enough to actually have that nice little white strip across the top, so I keep scratching myself.  Still, I feel rather girl-like, what with nails and all.  One more week of success, I'm treating myself to a manicure.

Somehow, with the exception of LB, I've won over the people who work in my department, and some that aren't in it.  I had a great time at the Deputy PMG luncheon that I went to, and it really kind of impressed me that he and the highly ranked attorney that arranged it all, know my mother.  I don't know that it'll help me, but they seemed to like me.  *grins* No one can resist the Me!:)

When I get cranky, or I'm not too happy or fond of someone, I tend to get kind of cranky, and I can just feel the ""go away"" vibes coming off of me.  I can be sweet as sugar, but it still kind of rolls off me, and they can feel it.  At least, that's what it seems like. 

It really upset me today when I was down at the seafood market.  Ok, so this sounds silly, but I was upset at the treatment of the live crabs.  They were just kinda hanging out, crammed into the bins that they were in, and everytime someone ordered, the guy would just grab one, and jerk it up, to rip off whatever crabs were still hanging on to it, and that would rip off legs and claws of the other ones.  

Ok.... I think I killed enough time, and I don't want to share everything at once."

"event","he Personality Defect Test
by saint_gasoline
Hippie
You are 0% Rational, 100% Extroverted, 0% Brutal, and 0% Arrogant.
You are the Hippie! Characterized by a strong sense of extroversion, irrationality, gentleness, and humility, you no doubt frolic through fields preaching peace and love to all! You are probably either very spiritual or needlessly paranoid about ""the man"", like most hippies, as a result of your focus on intuition and feelings over cold, brutal logic. You are also very, very social. And like any hippie, who would have no qualms about hitchiking across the country just to meet some interesting people, you too love to interact with others, even complete strangers. Because we know most any hippie is peace-loving and humble, it stands to reason that you, as well, are terribly gentle and humble, almost to the point of revulsion. Your carefree attitude of peace and harmony is probably very, very sickening to realists or cynics or anyone who isn't a hippie, to tell the truth. In short, your personality is defective because you are overly emotional, extroverted, gentle, and humble--thus making you an annoying hippie. And you listen to psychadelic rock and smoke a whole lot of pot. Okay, maybe not, but I wouldn't be surprised if you did.

To put it less negatively:

1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational.

2. You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted.

3. You are more GENTLE than brutal.

4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant."

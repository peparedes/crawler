"event","<p>I get this very uneasy, indifferent feeling in the pit of my stomach when I come to this here Livejournal.&nbsp; It takes me back to 2005 and the early days of just my Derek and I.&nbsp; I got butterflies reading my old entries about us making pineapple upside down cakes and watching Grease 2.&nbsp; We were so young it seems and SOOOO unBELIEVABLY IN LOVE.&nbsp; I miss those times because those times were really special.&nbsp; I mean, they STARTED us and made me realize what true love is and what being in love for the first time is like.&nbsp; Those times are what created our SON&lt;3 that we have now.<br />I LOVE how my info says that I'm 17.&nbsp; heehee.&nbsp; I am going to keep it like that for life, just so I will always remember and know how old I was when this was made.&nbsp; Ugh, I will be 20 next month and I swear, I feel ancient! =P<br />I just know that I am SO happy I have my son and that me and Derek are as in LOVE as we were back then.&nbsp; I will have my Dereks' forever and always and they're ALL I need. ;)&nbsp; I love them.&nbsp; And I say this alot, and I will say it again... but <em>NOTHING</em> in this universe is better than being a mom.<br />MUAH!<br />Love.</p>"

All that and SO MUCH MORE that I miss about being a young, free spirited CHILD with no worries in the world. <br />Everything snuck up on me with no warning. Now married, having a child of my own in 5 weeks, although I still am one myself...?!?!?!...?!?!?!...?!?!!?... Not really what I thought would be going on with my life at 18 years old. I suppose you never know how things are going to go and what may happen. It's all such a surprise. <br /><br />I just realized that I listed ""surprises"" above and I also just said that what has happened to me is a ""surprise"".&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I miss that if I've still got it, if it's still happening....???<br /><br />Now I'm confused.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I'm not.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know exactly how it is.... <br /><br /><strong>innocence</strong> - Derek makes me maintain my innocence by taking care of me and treating me like his princess. <br /><br /><strong>friends</strong> - Derek's my best friend. <br /><br /><strong>fun</strong> - Derek and I always have such great fun together and when Derek Jr.'s here, we'll all have a blast as a little family. <br /><br /><strong>laughing</strong> - Derek makes me laugh more than anyone ever has. <br /><br /><strong>news</strong> - Derek always has news to tell me. We found out the best news together when we discovered we were going to be a mommy and daddy together. <br /><br /><strong>love</strong> - Derek and I are more in love than one could imagine. <br /><br /><strong>happiness</strong> - Derek IS my happiness. <br /><br /><strong>flirting</strong> - Derek and I still flirt. ;) <br /><br /><strong>surprises</strong> - Derek is always surprising me. We'll have a GREAT surprise here in a few weeks. <br /><br /><strong>weekends</strong> - Derek and I spend every weekend together, and I love it. <br /><br /><strong>lying</strong> - Derek lies for me as I do for him just so we can get one another out of snicky spots. Example: we got in a fight and I threw his cell at him and broke it. He called his mom and told her he dropped it and broke it so she wouldn't think I was a crazy bitch. =D<br /><br /><strong>boys </strong>- Derek is MY boy and my only boy.... the only one for me.<br /><br /><strong>sneaking</strong> - Derek and I are sneaky, WAHAHA. <br /><br /><strong>gossip</strong> - Derek and I gossip. <br /><br /><strong>secrets</strong> - Derek and I have loads and loads of secrets between the two of us that we'd never tell a soul. <br /><br /><strong>music</strong> - Derek and I listen to music together all the time. <br /><br /><strong>parties</strong> - Derek being in my life is always like a party. <br /><br /><strong>games</strong> - Derek and I always play games. <br /><br /><strong>shopping</strong> - Derek is my shopping KING! He buys me everything and anything I want and of course I sure do looooove that. <br /><br /><strong>school</strong> - Derek and I reminise about school and one day, we'll be sending our son off to school to make memories like the ones we share. <br /><br /><strong>crushes</strong> - Derek's my #1 crush. <br /><br /><strong>homework</strong> - Derek and I will help little Derek with HIS homework one day. ;) <br /><br /><strong>curfews</strong> - Derek and I will be giving little Derek a curfew....&nbsp;<br /><br />As I've noticed, the main word here is DEREK, and what I've noticed EVEN MORE is that I DO still have all of those things.<br />I have them in different ways, but I still have them fully, and BETTER.&nbsp; Instead of lying to a friend, Derek and I get to for one another to save one anothers ass, instead of doing my own homework that's a bore, I get to help our kid learn and do his, instead of being bored on the weekends and having no one to hang out with, I ALWAYS have Derek, instead of wanting love, having crushes and flirting with people, I'm MARRIED and have a strong secure relationship that's nothing but love, instead of having surprises every now and then, I'm living the surprise that shocked my life..... and instead of getting money from my mom to shop with, I now have a hub to buy me the universe!&nbsp;<br />None of it has went away.&nbsp; It's just all gotten tons better.&nbsp; I am STILL a young free spirited CHILD with no worries.&nbsp; I want my life no other way than the way it is.<br />I LOVE DEREK REED.</p>

"event","I'm bored, just waiting on Derek to come and get me.  He had to take Kyle to get his ID thingy, so ya know.
I am so tired, but I just cannot sleep.  It's really annoying! =-O
Today's going to be a very eventful day!  Derek and I are going to watch the rest of My Girl!  haha.... We fell asleep watching it lastnight, so we must finish it today.
I called Chris Clemons this morning.  I had somethings I wanted to tell him and I just wanted to talk to him.  It has been such a long time.... =/.... I'm really happy that I got to talk to him.  I've missed him so much.  I hope all goes well with him when he heads out for college and all.  I just know that he deserves the BEST that's out there.  Only the best.
I can't believe that it's already June.  May flew on by.  Paul's birthday's in 16 days. =)  He'll be 63 years old.... man, he's getting so old.  On July 7th, Ringo'll be turning 65..... man oh man.
I really feel like painting right now.  I wish I had my paints with me.
I don't even know why I write in here.  I write about the most pointless things most of the time.  But I have nothing else to do... so ya know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok, well I am going to go I guess.

<P>Right now I'm at Derek's house and we're watching Grease 2.&nbsp; I LOOOOVE this movie.&nbsp; He hasn't ever seen it, so we had to rent it.&nbsp; We also rented My Girl. =)</P>
<P>We just got done eating reallllly good food that his mom made.... and sweet potatoe fries that we took 1 hr getting from Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>I love Derek SO much.&nbsp; I really, honestly do.&nbsp; I just looked over at him, and&nbsp;a huge smile grew on my face&nbsp;and just *aghhhhhhh*.... he's so beautiful... he didn't see me looking though because he's too concentrated on the t.v.. =D&nbsp; We have so much fun together no matter what we're doing.&nbsp; Two nights ago we rented a movie and made a pineapple upside down cake together.&nbsp; It's just little stuff like that that means alot and is so great doing together.</P>
<P>We bought one another promise rings about a week ago.&nbsp; That, at times, just blows me away.&nbsp; I never thought in a million years that all that has happened between him and I would actually happen.... but then again, in a way I knew it would....</P>
<P>Well, I just wanted to write SOMETHING in here..... I'm going to go lay beside Derek and watch the movie!</P>

I want to see Derek so bad.  I just can not wait until he's- HERE. =)
Gosh, I could never express how much I love him.

Hm, today was a very, EVENTFUL day!!!!
I woke up to a call from Derek during 5th pd.  Then I read.   Got online. Read.  Talked to Derek on his way to work.  Then I read.  Slept.  Woke up to Derek calling on his break at work.  Then I read more, and here I am, about to go to more reading.

I am reading a book that Heather Mills-McCartney wrote.  I've fallen in love with her.   My mom bought it for me and when she gave it to me, I was like egh.  I wasn't planning on reading a book written by her.  I barely even liked her.  Now, I think the world of her and she's influenced me alot.  Sabrina, you're reading this book when I come.  You'll appreciate it as much as I do.

I've bitten my nails down so low! =O

Ok, this was the most pointless entry ever made.  I'm bored, that's all.  I suppose I'll go read.

"event","Hello all =)
I sure haven't used this thing in a while, and well, I feel it's about time to. =D
I am in GA of course, with nothing to do, so perhaps that's why, haha.
It sucks having to move here AGAIN, but whateverrrrrrrrrrrr.  I wish I were in FL more than anything.  But hey, that's the story of my life: moving from state to state every few months.
Blahhhhhh =*(
.... =)
Hmmm, what to say, what to say.....
OH!  I can NOT wait until Friday.  Derek's coming to GA to stay with me until Monday!!!!!  I think that will be the 2nd best day of my life.  The 1st best day of course is when we decided we should be together. =)
I seriously do NOT know what I would do without him.  He literally saved me from something (or someONE rather) that I nearly wanted to die over and man, he is just the best thing ever and I love him with ALL my heart and SOUL.  We KNOW for a 100% fact that we'll together forever and always.  We know it, we know it, and there's no doubt in our minds that we won't.  He always says that we're perfect, and that, we are.
I like how we were friends for such a long time before any of this occured between us.  It was only a matter of time and God knows it was and IS meant to be.
I never knew it was possible to love someone this much.  Although I KNOW John loved Yoko more than words can explain and same with Paul and Linda.... but I never experienced it, but I surely have now. =)

I didn't really get to tell anyone bye before I left.  I didn't go to school a whole week before hand and just, ughh.  I didn't want to.  It was too hard to up and leave again when I just did it a few months before hand.  I just wanted to leave and get it over with.
I'm really missing last summer for some reason. My days of being with Sabrina non-stop, Cymone, and Meaghon.  We had some fun.  And Sabrina if you're reading this, I was telling Derek about us meditating in the pool in my back yard that night at like, what, 3 in the morning?  haha.... hmmmm.... =)
In a way, I think this move may have been a good thing.  It just kinda.... I don't know, makes me realize some things.  I miss a few select people and my goodness, I sob over not being to be with Derek everyday, but, it'll all work out in the end.  I'll get to see him plenty in the mean time, and others.
I've changed alot lately.  Like, dealing with drugs and all.  I used to be keen on weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed as everyone knows, and I am pretty sure now that everyone knows I can't stand the shit.  And after trying ecstasy a few times, doing my fair share of cocaine, and doing acid..... YEAH.  That's enough.  Definitely not my thing.  I used to think I couldn't DARE have fun during the weekend unless a drug was involved, but all that changed I think when I realized I liked being sober and actually just being in my right state of mind.  WEIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRD huh?  haha. =)
I really wish I could have seen more of Nikki and Sabrina before I left.  I miss the two of you alot ya know.
It was such a nice day today..... I love the way it is outside come about, ummm..... 5 to 6.  I was on the phone with Derek and I told him all I want out of life is a house surrounded by beautiful green grass and to be able to have the windows open so the breeze can just blow on through.... of course he said that I will =)  But tonight all the windows were open and I could just lay there and smell the fresh air and look out the window to the huge open field of grass that lays in the back yard and it's soooo pretty =)

Ok, I'm rambling on and I've written alot, so I suppose I will go.

Love Love Love

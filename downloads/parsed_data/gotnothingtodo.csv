"event","well last Monday i had my usuall horse leasson on Malcolm and well this one went a little differant.  First i was going along like normal and all of the sudden he decided he really didn't want me to ride him anymore so he stared to back up realy really fast and i was kicking and slucking like crazy to make him for forward and then he reared so so so big, i mean he was standing straight up on his back leg. Of course i fall of because of the force of the rear and his head smacked my face really hard. So i'm laying there on the ground and all i see is Malcolm flipping over on me (normally when horses rears that big they loose there balence and tend to flip all the way over) But then he caught his balance and he kinda sat on me i guess and then fell over so he didn't fall on me (thank the lord). then he was scrambling all around to get up and he steps on my leg (but that wasn't that bad becasue his hoof just kinda slid of but i still had a big bruse there). So i'm laying on the ground in pain becasue my back hurts really bad. So i finally got up and my Trainer got on Malcolm so he new he did something bad, while i hobbled away and mom took me to the emergence room.  but through all of that all i had was a few really naisty bumbs and bruses, and cuts and scraps. Oh yeah Malcolm did something to his tail but its not brocken so thats good. I was so sore the next few days i could bairly get out of bed. I went to Kt's house and she watched movies with me (thanks kt). hey, it got me out of babysitting. But Marc, my trainer, said that the last person something that bad happened to on a horse that he saw the guy died. Oh my gosh i was so scary, and belive me i have a huge horse, (just about a 17 hand saddlebred) My friend was there watching when all this went on becasue she had a leasson after me and she told me that i she did when it happened was cried because she thought i would die or already died. Well at least i know i have friens who care. So then everybody wanted me to sell him becasue he did all of this for no reasson, so i got so depressed for about the next 5 days and i tured all al pictures in the house of Malcolm and me together around so i did have to look at them because i would just start to cry if i wasn't already. all i did for those days was eat and cry myself to sleep. I really dont wanna sell my baby!!! Well we made some phone calls to all the old owners and asked if Malcolm has ever done this with them and they all said no, so we dont know y he did that or anything but my mom is letting me keep him!!! I even rode him 2 days ago. I was so scared! But i got through and for right now he is still my baby and i still love him a hole ton. So it looks like everything is working out A.O.K. and my smile is back on my face."

"event","I just downloaded this really great song and its makeing me feel quite happy. On Friday night i went to see signs. OH MY GOODNESS it was by far the scariest movie i had ever seen in my hole life! I couldn't believe i was so scared!!!!! I screamed once. lol i think its funny when i scream at movies. But i have to admitt the movie did have a really really really good ending. Then on Sat. i had to work from 9 to 5 out at the barn were my horse is then i went with a friend to see another movie. Austin Power is so funny and i was really in the mood for a happy movie to considering the one i saw the night before. Then i went to Kt's house for a while. (sorry i didn't sleep over Kt, lol) Then when i came home my brother decided to have a rather large ""get-together"". with some friend so i went to bed right away. Today was so so so boring! i had apsolutly nothing to do except talk on the phone with friends and eat and eat and eat some more. oh yeah and i played about a thousand games of pool. now i am sitting here while you listen to me go on and on about piontless stuff. O.K. guess what....my mom put Malcolm (my horse) in training for a month. so now he will be worked everday and trained to do more things. and i'll learn on the way to.  On sat. we hooked a cart up to the back of him and he drove me around. It was fun and i'm so proud of my baby. Well i cant think of anything else to say except Bye. but if i think of anything else i'll be sure to keep you updated"

 So happy 4th everyone!!! all my family coming up and we celibrate it all together. We do it every year and this year i'm actually pertty excited about it this year, I have no tan and i always spend that day outside doing stuff so i'm sure i'll catch up on my tan so that a plus. but i'll probly just burn a lot and then i'll hurt the day of the show but of well that would be all my falt. well i gotta go pick up my dad from the bar  or somthing like that.

I was in gym class, first hour, running my five min. run like i always do! Nothing out of the ordinary. Well up till now, All of the sudden i got really really tired and really sick like i was going to throw up all over. I started to bult to the bathroom, and well i made it about half way there and all of the sudden it happened. I puked all over! And it was right in frount of this huge study hall full of Seniors. I could have crawled under a table and shot myself right then and there! well i fell over in frount of everyone cuz i got really light heading all of the sudden and all these teachers came running tward me and all i could hear was all the seniors say "" oh gross"" and "" oh my gosh Yuck""! I had to lay in the health room for about 2 hours with my best friend Maddie keeping me company (she liked it cuz she got out of class). I was kinda werid though cuz the office people were trying to hold me still cuz i was shakeing so badly! I was a little scared and freezing cold (but for some odd reason i was sweating really bad)! But hay i got out of class for 2 hours and i'm mostly all better now! I wonder what those seniors think of me (little old freshman) now? 
But of course something good had to have happened. Well this guy i really like, Jon, was there today. He wasn't there for 3 days in a row. I couldn't take it! but i saw him lots today and lets just say he saw my little gym, running, pukeing incedent. Oh well life geos on! And Guess What!?!?!? I got my Temps. Yay! i was so worryed i was going to fail the test, but i only got 4 wrong. Go Me!!!! I'm kinda sceared to start driveing but your suposed to do  something that scares you everyday. I try to but somedays it's kinda hard to and i get really lazy sometimes, wait i get lazy all the time. Well my day is finally over and i think i can hear my cozy bed calling my name!"

"event","Well I have always wanted to keep a journal to right my own personal thoughts in. People always told me it would cool me down a little bit if i rote down what is bothering me. I dont think so but i guess it's always worth a shot. I've tried keeping a journal in the past but i always tend to loose things and well i lost it, or i just forget about it. Well doing this live journal is a good thing because of course I cant loose it and I'm one of those people that are always on the computer but mainly just sit there and stair at the monitor because i cant think of anything to look up, so now i can have something to do. Oh great now everyone can look up my own personal thoughts! Oh well i dont really have many personal things. Lets just day i live in a small town were noting really exciting happend. It's one of though friendly places were everyone knows each other and even if you dont we always wave or say hello. Although if you talk to people everyone tends to say that they live in a boring town that nothing ever happens in, so i guess i'm not alone in life. Well at least i hope i'm not!"

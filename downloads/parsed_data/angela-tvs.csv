But to clear things up, you have been<br>given a power that makes you extremly strong.<br>This is of course speaking in pyshical terms.<br>When doing good deeds the power could be used<br>as helping people in e.g. fights or those under<br>a fallen building etc. For bad purposes the<br>power could simply kill/beat anyone until the<br>gifted gets his way.<br>You are however as a person on the good side.<br>You are the leader type and have a tendancy to<br>look at the whole picture rather than details.<br>That could make you come off as inconsiderate,<br>but that's far from the truth. You can be<br>impulsive and aggressive but you mean no harm<br>with it. Sometimes it can even save you. If you<br>were to be in a group with others who have<br>super powers you would be focusing more on them<br>and the situation rather than yourself. So to<br>even it out, you can be egotistical at times,<br>but it's because you ignore your needs every<br>once in a while. You are responsible and brave<br>but could still be seen as reckless.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> Since you focus on the<br>team/family/group of friends you could start<br>thinking that they don't care about you since<br>they don't seem to look after you the way you<br>do to them. Also you could intentionally<br>endanger yourself (even in everyday life) when<br>doing descicions without thinking it through<br>that much. But a leader with more sense of<br>responsibility does not however come off as<br>reckless, but logical.</p>

 now... not so much. 

On another note, hopefully i'm going to see Mr. and Mrs. Smith this friday. whether all of my friends are coming, I don't know. Probably not since they'll all have other people they'll want to bring and for once I just want it to be us, you know? No people i don't know, no people that annoy me.  

My friend Stephanie is here for the summer and i want her to go, but her step-brother wants to come and i swear he is soo annoying. What is it with sixth graders, huh?

And anyway, Piper probably can't come because her parents are psycho protective and they don't let her go see PG-13 movies. And somebody told me that it was rated R; that totally ruined my day.

Today is the uber suck of all days. it is so boring i can't get ahold of Era, and my mind is spinnig with new story ideas that i don't have the time to write down. 


GAAAAA! 

I hope my aunt comes to get me soon, i'll go nuts if i have to spend the ENTIRE summer in this hell-hold of a state. I swear."

Like fire, you have a hot<br>temper and you can be warm and loving as well<br>and angry and wild. It all really comes down to<br>what you are feeling. You have a lot of close<br>friends who you are very protective over, and<br>with your temper probably some enemies too. You<br>are not Miss Popular in school since you are<br>your own person and don't want to be forced<br>into behaving this or that way. You are the<br>untamed wild horse, the kind that everyone<br>wants to catch. But you don't want to be tied<br>down for the moment and just keep going with<br>your little crushes. Your will is strong and if<br>you set your mind to do something, you will<br>most likely succeed. But beware, your friends<br>may not always accept your mood-swinging<br>behaviour. Even if you don't mean to be mean,<br>they can still feel hurt. You just need to<br>start thinking some things through before you<br>do them, and not always jump in with so much<br>courage. One day you may be hurt because of<br>that, but then again, your element isn't fire<br>if you start to analyse situations before you<br>act.

Only<br>then one can tell how they will handle it. Just<br>don't make others fall so you can know who they<br>really are. You on the other hand may be a very<br>quick recoverer and don't let people bring you<br>down. You are your own, and you're find with<br>that.

As she walked away, tears streaming down her face, the boy grabbed her arm and said.... You're not pretty, you're beautiful. I dont want to be with you forever. I NEED to be with you forever. And I wouldnt cry if you walked away...I'd die... Post this on your bulletin and....... Tonight at midnight your true love will realize they like you.

I mean, she's got drama, and chorus, AND cheerleading, oh and not to mention  HOMEWORK.  I was only planing on having gardening club(which Era was also having), tennis, and Drama. Homework is an activity all on its own. I hope she can manage.She was trying to SLEEP on the bleachers during gym today. i don't know.............

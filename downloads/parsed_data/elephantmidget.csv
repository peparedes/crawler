"event","Hey How is everybody doing!!!.  As you can tell I am alive and well and not dead and rotting, even if I feel that way sometimes.  I am still looking for a heating and air conditioning job and still looking. boooooooohoooooooooo.  I have been having a good summer hanging out with my friends.       
   And by the way Tom Fest part 2 was great.  This was the most I ever drank.  Holy shit. woo.  I had 2Heinican, 1Bailies Irish Cream, 1 MGD light,  2Miller light, a budwieser.  I don't know why I remember that but I do.  I met a really cool girl at the party but it was right before she was leaving.  So thats that.
   As of lately I have been just watching the news a lot and litening to music and playing this Xbox game.  It is Beyond Good&Evil.  It is pretty good but I havn't played it for about a week.  I have been ocupied listening to a lot of music.
   I got quite a few new cds this summer.  Some of them are, Lars Fredericksen and the Bastards-Vicking, Rise Against-Siren Song of the Counter Culture,  Two Stretch Arm Strong cds and they are a good live band.  I think the best cd that I got was the new Leftover Crack-Fuck World trade.  
   Maybe that offends a lot of people and it offended me at first but I did a little bit of research and found out what the world trade organization is.  I understand why Al Quaida did what they did but any for of terrorism is unacceptable.  A lot of the stuff that The World Trade Organization does helps out our economy but it puts a lot of companies out of buisiness and hurts a lot of countries by forcing our products down their throat by selling them cheaper and making businesses overseas going out of business.    At the same the the WTO is trying to help the economy, it is killing animals and the environment with all of the factories, because all it cares about is money.  
   I know Tom, Bob and Dustin will disagree with me but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Goerge W Bush is a very bad president.  Our economy is way down but a lot of that had to do with the destruction of the world trade buildings.  George W Bush made a lot of enemies out of our allies.  He lowered the taxes for the rich.  We invaded Iraq because they have weapons of mass destruction and we still havn't found any weapons yet and now we have a country on our hands wich is a mess with terrorism.  George W. Bush didn't sign a document to help stop global warming.  We were the only country that didn't sign it.  Just very recently he refused to renew the assault weopon ban.  Goerge Bush is forming new jobs but over half of them are overseas.  All these companies are having jobs for people overseas because they claim our education is poor and that the people overseas are more qualified to do our jobs.  This means too the people overseas are used for cheaper labor.  Our government should of put more money towards education.  One state passed a law where they can bring people overseas to do our jobs.  What happens if other states do that.  Americans will be the minority when it comes to jobs.  So I am scared if Goerge Bush is our president again butI don't know if John Kerry will be much better.  When it comes down to it our country is going to have a hard time in the future and as of right now I don't want to bring any kids into this world.  Thats my opinion."

"event","I asked Rafa why she never answered my question about going out with me and she said It would be better to be friends.  I said it is ok.  It is better to still be friends than nothing at all.  It is sad and dissapointing, but I won't let it bring me down.  I will just have to continue on. Hopefully I will eventually find someone who will make me happy.  It is ok, I am used to expecting the worse.  I got all you to talk to about this now.  I am signing out now.  Time for bed"

"event","Tonite sucked.  I work at this shit hole called portillos.  It seems like lately nothing ever seems to go right.  I like this mexican girl at my worked named Rafa.  I like her a real lot.  Some days she seems like she likes me and others she seems very annoyed around me.  After writing her a couple letters I told her wasn't going to write her anymmore because they probably annoy her.  She tells me no, write many more. So I do that and three more later she seems very frustrated, so hopefully I have written the last one.  I explain to her if she doesn't like me she needs to tell me and if that is so we can still be friends.  I told her I'd be sad, but not angry and I would be ok.  Girls are crazy.  Anyways today class was cool.  The furnace we fixed in our furnace class last week, we got to install it today and it worked really well.  I was shocked.  Rob and I made a rack and shelf system for the a-coil to go on and the teacher tells us after we make it it needs to be level so I get a level and it is perfectally level.  It has to be level to make sure the refrigerant flows through the a coil equally.  It was a 90+ furnace.  That means it is 90-96% eficienat.  But in my electronic controls class It is taking us forever to get the conventional furnace to work right.  Whoever wired it last semester had the brain of a micro organism that lives in a peace of shit.  I am somewhat looking forward to seeing Rafa tommorrow, Hopefully she gives me a answer about going out with me.  I hope she says yeah but if not life goes on."

"event","Hey this is my first journal, Wow.  Now everyone can see how boring and crappy stuff can get or how good stuff can get.  I picked the name elephantmidget because the two words contradict each other and nothing better came to mind.  I will be here later one to actually write something somewhat interesting."

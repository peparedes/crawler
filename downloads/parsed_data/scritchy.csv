For the purposes of this experiment, anything I list in this here list must qualify under the following criterias:

1.  It must be more interesting in some way than a regular Porsche 911. (mostly because if i listed average porsches, there would be about 15 entries a day all saying ""prosche carrera 911 of [pick any] color""
2.  It must have been noticed on the way too or from the bart or bus transit station to my office on montgomery and jackson
3.  I must have seen it and muttered to myself some form of ""omfg.  god damn rich people!""


Today we'll start the show with this item:

- black BMW 760il v12.   
  V12?!  jezuz...  but then i guess you need a v12 when your car weighs *4905 lbs* !!
  oh and the ""l"" in 760il means ""long"".  this 7 series bmw was LONG.

"event","Oh yes.  This week I have experienced a major lifetime event.  The ramifications of this event... what it all means... is unknown.  It could be great.. the unlocking of an all new era of my life... or it could spell my imminent doom.  But whatever it is, it is exciting.


That's right.

For the first time ever.

I won something playing the California Lottery.  

Well, actually, to be pedantic, i didn't ACTUALLY win anything... I won $2.  But then, i spent $2 on the ticket in the first place, but that's besides the point.  The IMPORTANT part of the story is that I turned in a lottery ticket, and got cash money in return.

For those of you not keeping score, this is a major event for 2 reasons.
1.  I've been playing the lottery pretty often since the day I turned 18 (11 years ago) and never won a dime
2.  Statement is only half true, but the last time i ""won"" anything was $1, and I was mugged and robbed of my lottery ticket (and actually my entire wallet, cell phone, and keys) before i was ever able to cash IN said $1 ticket.

So, you can see that the groundbreaking part of this is that I've just broken a 11 year streak of never winning even the smallest thing playing the lottery.  Which, frankly, I think in itself is some sort of amazingly retarded accomplishment deserving of an entry in the guinness book of world records...


hm.  now that I think about it, i really ought to have saved those $2 for posterity... but i think i might've already eaten it.  damn!"

<a href=""http://www.infected.com"">INFECTED</a> for PSP.

This is the latest game that I've worked on.  Now aside from just being a fun game, there's an aspect of this game that I was the head person in implementing that is basically a giant social experiment.  Seeing as how LiveJournal itself is pretty much a giant social experiment, I'd like to poke at this online community to see if I can use it to help perpetuate this little experiment of ours.  (particularly because it was a pretty original idea, and original ideas are financially risky propositions, and the mere fact that we have an original idea that WORKS is worth looking at)

In a sentence, the social experiment is...
<b>INFECT THE WORLD WITH YOUR PSP</b>

More specifically, here's how it works.  You start by creating an avatar with a particular look, a name, and a location of origin.  If you play multiplayer with somebody, and you beat, them, you INFECT them.  Meaning, when they play against people they look like YOU now, and pass on YOUR virus.  

At this point, the have 2 options.
1.  Go back and re-play the last 3 single player missions they've played and win them to clear out the virus.  in these missions, the zombies actually look like YOU.
2.  Play and win 3 more multiplayer games and infect them with YOUR virus. 

After that, they can go on their merry way and try to spread their own virus once again.


This is all tracked online and you can SEE how many people your virus has infected across the world, and see a cool map that shows where they all are.  


Since we gave people a choice, it's very interesting to see how many people pass on infections vs cleaning them off locally etc.  and let me tell you it's quite addicting to keep looking back at the stats and see how your virus is doing.

But it would be SO much more interesting if more people played it.


So here's my request to you, people of LiveJournal.  Go out, buy the game, and play it online or with friends locally!  Tell your friends about it!  hijack my LJ post and post it on your own so that others hear about this game!  
See if YOU can INFECT THE WORLD!


Now a quick side note, This is not a complicated game.  it's simple and it's fun.  You shoot things. they pop in a bloody mess.  you squeal in joy.  it's all good!  Most people we've showed the game to are able to pick up the basic skills of play quickly.  So don't be intimidated by the gameplay!  give it a try!

woohoo!


<img src=""http://www.infected.com/images/infected_ws_11.jpg"">
Besides, how can you not play a game where you can become a Mad Cow while killing zombies and other players in multiplayer games?!"

"event","as time goes on, it seems like i have less and less intelligent and inspired thing to say, whether be observations or just some sort of miscellaneous revellation or creative spasm on any given moment.

I thought i was supposed to get wiser as i get older, and more observant.  Instead, I've become more dull, less energetic, and generally less thoughtful.

The upswing to this is, of course, that being less thoughtful has generally led me to be less pissed off on a regular basis.  Since thinking is generally what pisses me off in the first place, as my unguided mind automatically seems to gravitate toward noticing the millions of everythihng from miniscule tragedies to outride travesties in life, and how utterly futile it is for one person to attempt blanket remedy any of them outside the immediacy of the one or two people next to them (if even that).

the downside is that, in general, i feel like i've lost some of my edge.  The flamign intensity that drives me to excel.  That might not be a problem, if only my aching need for self improvement and for elevation above mediocrity and ""averageness"" weren't exactly as it was before.

sigh.  

or perhaps i've just become so subconsciously involved in noticing irritating things that it's become a metacircular problem.

It brings me down.  It makes me hate people.  It makes it hard for me to have faith in humanity.  It makes me want to hate and makes me feel guilty about not being perpetualy angry and vindictive for others who fall victim to worse things than i've ever experienced personlly.  It makes me want to hurt people back who have hurt others injudiciously for their own benefit.  In it's extremest, it makes me want to be a vigilante, freely dispensing my own neurotic and arrogantly self justified sense of ""justice"", protecting unknown victims of the future by dispensing the agents of said victimizing before they have a chance to perpetuate their hate.  In a word, it makes me crazy.

sometimes i've been accused of not appreciating all that i have.  i beg to differ.  and here's your proof.  if i wasn't thankful for the things i do have, i might actually BE out there being some crazed vigilante with nothing else to lose but my sanity.

Although it does make me appreciate and be impressed by the sacrifice and love many must suffer and give to overcome the evil that others purvey, it simply makes me so blindingly angry that such terrible things and people exist in the first place.

The power of greed, corruption, and power in the world of men (and equally, women) sickens me so much it sometimes makes me want to scream and wish for my own freedom from this world, whether it is to wake from a bad dream into a better place, or just to pass from this plane of being completely so that my consciousness can be free from suffering the aggravation of watching others treat each other with such indecency.

i've never actually seen any thing like that happen before in real life... but sure enough, here was this big rig lying on it's side, squirting oil and whatnot from it's underbelly.

My light turns green, and i don't go for a few seconds... should i stop to help?  probably not, i'm sick as a dog so dizzy i'm not even sure i shoudl be driving, and stopping would really probably just cause mroe traffic problems.  so i drive past slowly, and pick up my phone to dial 911.

I had to dial 911 *6 times* before i got anything other than ""we're sorry, all circuits are currently busy""... wtf is up with that?  then when i finally get through, i have to be on hold for like 5-10 minutes.  alltogether the entire attempt to call 911 probably took 15 or so min.  now what if i was like bleeding to death?  i coudl have DIED already.

Does it ever occur to you that the government might be raising/lowering terror alerts purely to limit public opposition to our ongoing pursuits in the middle east?  continued public feeling of insecurity is the only thing allowing our government to continue keeping soldiers over there.  my general sense is that nobody really WANTS us to be over there, but some feel it NECESSARY to continue to ensure our safety.

and without a regular reminder that are safety is being threatened, i doubt there would be any support at all.

i mean, just look at the terminology used in general: ""Terror ALert Level lowered to Yellow""... terror alert?!  i mean, come on, that term in itself is frightening.  They could equally have called it something a little more innocuous, like, ""National Citizen Safety Level"" or some such thing, but terror alert... i don't thin kthey could have called it anything more disconcerting.

On the way back from tahoe after a day of snowboarding... not a SINGLE person in my car fell asleep on the ride back.

That just simply DOES NOT hapen!  in fact, 80% of the time, the entire carload of people pass out by the time i make it back to the highway from the ski resort.

This time, somehow all 5 people in the car stayed awake the entire trip home.  A large part of it is thanks to Carol's silly and pointless yet apparently highly effective game.  The object of the game is for a person to name 2 movies, and then for the rest of the people to come up with a 3rd movie that has an actor from both of the first 2 movies.

so you might say, for example, Lethal Weapon, and Silence of the Lambs... and one possible 3rd movie would be Maverick.  (Mel gibson from Lethal, and Jodie Foster from Silence).

stupid, right?  well, it was great distraction during the ride home.

Sweet.

We started talking about ""gushing"" and getting all giddy about a guy/girl that one is dating.  She called it the ""teehee"" stage, which i found quite amusing.  She was noting that she hadn't noticed me really talking a lot about Tina, and it made me think about it a bit... 

I don't think most guys HAVE a ""teehee"" stage.  I have been guilty of gushing/talking about a girl I'm really into... but i decided that's less because they're any more interesting, but rather because they're stressin me out and being difficult.  If things are working out well, i don't really talk about it as much.

My friend thinks that guys are maybe just suppressing such comments for fear of being called a ""pussy"" or something for being too sensitive touchy feely blech.  but i just don't think it even occurs to guys to be all talkin about how cool their girl is to their other guys.  Aside from that, now that i typed that sentence, it just sounds plain rude to be doing that to your buddies, especially the single ones.  (ie ""dude, rub it in why don't you, a$$hole!"")

It went something like this.

The end of the world is drawing near.  It's not fire and brimstone and flaming death as people always talk about.  No, in this dream it was more insidious.  At random unpredictable times, entire buildings and surrounding areas just vanish.  Nobody seems to actually see it happen... they just turn around and turn back and suddenly there's nothign where a whole building used to be.  and everybody inside is gone too... to who knows where.  Where can one even THINK to hide when anywhere you might go is liable of vanishing into the unknown.

So here I am.  walking around waiting for my time to ""vanish"".  friends and family disappear without a trace.  Suddenly all anybody wants is to relish their remaining time in existence with their loved ones, doing things they always wanted to do.  A melancholy indulgement into their deepest wishes and desires.  

Then in this dream, for some reason, i meet a kitty.  Like, an actual little feline.  a kitty.  meow.  this kitty in this dream is more sentient than a typical kitty.  it can't talk or nuthin, but somehow it understood everything i was saying, and could respond through kitty antics.  And for some reason, this kitty became my companion for the remaining time on this earth.

"event","So i've renamed this journal.  Some might wonder why the choice of such an odd title.

Well, you may notice also that i put in a link to my other webpage, which some/all of you already know about of course.  That's my ""fun"" blog.  filled with randomness, cheezy drawings, interesting events, and pictures.  Run completely by perl scripts i wrote myself merely as an excercise to keep me from forgetting perl.

This is my ""serious"" blog full of (still random) deeper thoughts, questions, and emotions.  Slightly simpler to update when i just have something on the tip of my mind to spew forth into textual form.

anyhow... just explaining myself for no reason at all."

"event","there was no prompting for this.  no reason.  no context.  it just popped into my head a couple days ago when i wasn't thinking about anything in particular.  Mildly disturbing.  more disturbing that i have no reason to even consider this.  perhaps by nature i consider all the worst possible situations so that if i ever find myself in one, i'll be ready to handle it.  or at least bad situations won't seem quite as bad as what i'm already mentally considering.  
or maybe i'm just messed up in the head.

Here goes:
---

What if somebody nabbed everybody you cared about in any significant quantity... mom dad sis bro best friend, significant other.  and then put them in a room.  and then took you and put YOU in the same room... except they said to you.

I'm going to shoot one of these people in the head.  You get to choose who.  If you fail to choose somebody in the alotted time, they will all die.  You have 5 seconds...

5...
4...
3...
2...


----
the easy answer is... myself.
but then...  what if they stipulate you can't choose yourself.  and if you try to kill yourself or choose yourself, everybody dies.... what then..."

"event","92 mill.  the upcomign lotto.  Makes you kinda think about what if you WON it.

money is like MSG.

For the strange few who don't know what it is, MSG is Monosodium Glutamate.  Most often found in chinese food and instant noodles.  it's called a ""flavor enhancer"".  A select few like the taste of MSG alone (gross!), but most people only like it in addition to other flavors, and don't even realize that MSG is enhancing their favorite taste.

Money is a lot like MSG.  I think most level minded people will agree that the now cliche ""money can't buy you happiness"" is more or less true.  at least *not on its own*.  money is like a happiness enhancer.  it can only make better what flavor is already there.  

BUT like MSG, money can make things worse.  ie MSG and chocolate... bad combo.  EW.  

money CAN enhance your happiness, it's not GUARANTEED to.  You must use your money/msg selectively, and with care.  Using too much or using it in the wrong situations will definitely go awry.  

If you are the lucky person to win $92 million... sprinkle a bunch of MSG on your creme brulee and eat it, feel sick... remember that feeling and think about it every time you want to solve a problem or try to cure an unhappy day with your dumptruck of money.

and then toss me a cool mill for helping you on your way to being the happiest MSG.. er... multimillionaire in the world."

"event","I have no thoughts on this.

except that everybody has made a bigger deal out of nothing than i have ever seen before in my life.  I mean really.  peopel are making a big deal out of davis.  whatever, it's not like it was JUST HIM jacking up the state.  he just had a big part of it.

People are making a big deal about ahnuld being governor.  big deal.  So he's famous and has a funky accent.  i don't think he'll make a bad governor.  ultimately it's the people he chooses to advise him, and i think he's actually pretty stand up guy.  and he's NOT going to be easily bribed considering he has so many piles of money to bathe in.  so what the hell.

anyways.
 that's all.

"event","Random Feeling of the Day:  Dammit my back hurts again.


. Love knows no bounds .

This is a phrase you may have heard of before.  but i got to thinking... let's say for the sake of argument that that's true.  That love has no bounds.  That would imply the canonical thoughts, love is unbound by: race, age, religion, geography, some might argue even death.  But more interestingly, does it imply that love does not know the bounds of... time?  reciprocation?  species(!?!?). paradoxically, life?  or most interestingly... another passion or love?

time... is it possible to love across time?  i suppose i'd have to say yes, as a variety of strange people seem to be madly in love with dead people who have done famous things.

reciprocation... is it possible that love knows not the bounds of reciprical love?  hmm... I guess the answer is yes, as many a person has been ruined by just that.

LIFE... that one is just weird.  life is what makes the other bounds bounds in the first place.  age, race, etc etc... all these things are an artifact of being ""alive"".  Age wouldn't even be an issue if nobody died of it.  race woudln't be an issue if life on this planet wasn't so divided among factions.  life is what brings the most boundaries to this thing called love.  If an old man marries a young woman 50 yrs younger than he, is it not possible that she actualyl loves him?  but yet, we all have this natural suspicion that it's just not very likely.  think about that one.

Species... ok, well, i know people love their pets.  but not LOVE their pets.  (gross)  Listed only for completeness of the thought.  Then again... there apparently ARE some people that LOVE their pets... but i wonder... do these people do things like that to their pets because they LOVE them, or because they DESIRE the activity.  Either way it's gross, but i'm not convinced that it's an act of love.

finally... Love... Love is a boundary to itself.  Can one truly love one person if you ""love"" another in the same way?  i'm not quite sure you can.  Sure you have groups of people that allow multiple wives and whatnot... but having not experienced what it feels like to be in that situation, i cannot fathom it.  i suppose i'm biased as i mostly describe myself as ""fiercely monogamous"".  but still... how many times have you or somebody you know or heard about been in a situation where multiple people or things become a blocking factor in really falling in love?  ie another guy... or another girl... or the love of freedom.  or the love of a hobby or obsession. seems like a lot.  

This seems like a huge paradox to me.  Love is an inhibitor to itself.  Love seems to exist solely to challenge the human spirit, mind, and heart in ways that no other creature is challenged.

Wait.  did somebody say a challenge?

oh dayam.  *BRING IT ON*."

I seem to be playing an increasing amount of poker lately.  Alex called mea poker fiend.  Can't say i blame him.

I play poker in varying degrees of frequency, stakes, and game types with no less than 5 groups:
   1. the old skool crew (ji avis tony franklin davey etc).  roughly $10-20 buy in, random games
   2. David Lu's weekly sunday table.  $30+ buy in, random games (recently chagned to holdem tourny style)
   3. my roommate's wednesday night table.  $20-40 buy in, straight up holdem or 7stud
   4. my coworker's friends' table when they have an open spot.  $40 buy in (but they play crazy and most of the time about 1/4-1/2 of the people have to reach into their wallets.  and hte last game is $9/per screw your neighbor)
   5. my OTHER coworker's game.  $20-30 buy in.  occasional.  random games.

this week alone i played on wed AND thurs nights.  and normally sunday too, but that game got cancelled this week.  And it looks like my bad luck streak may finally be starting to turn around, since i broke even (more or less) both nights.  

I don't know why any of you would find any of that interesting... but whatever.  haha.

This morning, my mind seems to be preoccupied with why my MR2 seems to be suckin down gas like a champ suckin down tequila shots on his birthday.  I don't get it.  I just replaced the dangnabbit cap, rotor, plugs, and wires.. it shoudl be sucking up LESS gas it seems to me.  Damn.  I wish i wasn't such a half-assed mechanic.  I need to take a class or something.

oh well.
anyways.  managed to squander the first 1.5 hrs of the work day already.  best be gettin back to the grind.

vrooom!


PS..  NOBODY BUY *ANYTHING* FROM CIRCUIT CITY ONLINE.  those bastards are the worst damn customer service a$$holes i've ever seen.  Misled me 3 times, wasting a lot of time.  And when they tell you to go to the local store to accomplish something regarding customer service *don't believe them* they're lying.  got sent home EVERY time dejected.  ARGH!"

Why have a balked til now?  pride i suppose.  I have a blog here:  http://psychosis.scritch.net
and everything on that site i wrote from scratch in perl as an excercise.  But i don't get any of the community benefits, and i'm tired of posting comments as ""anonymous""... so here i go.

what annoys me is... SOME OTHER PUNK ALREADY TOOK MY USERNAME!!!  there is another scritch, and his livejournal is completely empty, so his/her sole purpose here is to annoy me by taking up my name.  heheh

if you are there, give me your account, punk!"

Though I will say the no-meat-on-Friday has always been really easy, since fish doesn't count as 'meat' and what are the two main sources of protein in this country?  Tofu and fish.  XD"

"event","Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!

As a special treat, I've allowed the following items to be added to today's menus!

- heart-shaped sugar cookies (both frosted and unfrosted)
- double cherry chocolate sundaes (with red, white, and pink sprinkles!)
- cherry, strawberry, lychee, and watermelon Italian ices, gelati, and sherbets
- seasonal candies in dozens of shapes, sizes, and flavors

Enjoy the treats, everyone, but let's not get greedy!

a great warm up for tonight!!!!!

it was mostly seated but teh crowd was into it and the sean and alan comedy act was out in force.

they played a lot of old stuff... jackey's jig, billy peddle, bad as i am, chemical worker's song, run runaway, more that i'm forgetting... two brand new songs that they were JUST starting to play..... walk on teh moon for the second time ever and untitled that had a title.

i realized the instrumental in capt wedderburn was give me your hand.

i got very excited adn proud of myself for this belated realization.  heh.

they finished by standing at the front of the stage to sing river driver unplugged and it was great.  unplugged is HARD to doyou need a very powerful voice.  not surprisingly, they do it masterfully.  

greattttttttttttt show.  so excited about tonight!!!!!!!"

"event","so i finally got my new mandolin!!!  long story but i've been pushing it back for various reasons, but i called today and they had eastman 615 and 815 in and THEY WERE ON SALE so off i went. 

i got the eastman 815 and as usual, those who give me advice never fail.  it sounds UNBELIEVABLE... it's AMAZING to play... and it's GORGEOUS!   it's a late graduation present partially, which is good because even heavily discounted it was EXPENSIVE but it sounds like it cost thousands more, seriously.

Let it know just who you are 
There's still a girl inside of you, 
Connecting star to star 
I'm glad to see you're taking flight 
I'll spot the brightest one 
So breathe, breathe, breathe in the night 
Your journey's just begun 
 
Did you look up to find 
You were left behind? 
Did your heroes and stars fade? 
Did the one you love 
Cradle you up above? 
Will your heroes and stars play? 
 
You're a lullaby 
For the Texas sky tonight 
Your heroes and stars are bright 
So hey, lone star, 
There you are 
Shining bright in the dark 
Don't wait for your heroes and stars 
To save your day"

"event","Q: How many Bush Administration officials does it take to change a light bulb?
A: None. There is nothing wrong with the light bulb; its condition is improving every day. Any reports of its lack of incandescence are illusional spin from the liberal media. Illuminating rooms is hard work. That light bulb has served honorably, and anything you say undermines the lighting effort. Why do you hate freedom?"

"event","<P>So today is my last day in Virginia... and something did happen this past week that everyone has been keeping track of... the missing park ranger in Colorado who was found dead last Saturday.&nbsp; This is always a disturbing thought... I was really hoping he'd be okay.&nbsp; I just had to lower the flag to half-staff- all NPS sites have flags at half-staff through Friday.</P>
<P>Anyway, here's a recap from yahoo.. I'm not sure I'm allowed to copy the article from inside.nps...</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""News Article""><BR>ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, Colo. - A park ranger who had been missing for eight days in Rocky Mountain National Park died of head injuries from a fall on the day he left to patrol the rugged backcountry, park officials said Monday. <BR>Jeff Christensen's body was found by a hiker near Spectacle Lakes on Saturday, about three miles from where the 31-year-old ranger had started his patrol.<BR>Autopsy results released Monday show he likely died on July 29 between 6 p.m. and midnight. He had left that morning, and park visitors reported seeing him alive near a summit that afternoon.<BR>More than 200 people had joined the search for Christensen in a 26-square-mile area of mountainous wilderness. The sound of gunshots at one point and radio static had given them hope that he might be alive and trying to signal for help.<BR>Park officials were still investigating the circumstances of Christensen's death, said Al Nash, spokesman for the National Park Service in Washington, D.C.<BR>Christensen had been a ranger at the park since 2002, but he was working his first summer on the park's east side and may have been on his first patrol in the area where he died, park officials said. His body was found at about 13,000 feet.<BR>Christensen was believed to be the first ranger to die on duty in the park's 90-year history.<BR></lj-cut><BR><BR></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also like I said today is my very last day working, tomorrow is my last day in Virginia.&nbsp; BLAH!</P>"

"event","alrite. a minor recap of what it feels like for your school to WIN THEIR FINAL FOUR GAME AND GO TO THE CHAMPIONSHIPS!

1. There are no seats in the bars at 11:30. A.M.
2. You realize what fun it would be to be 21 and at least be able to be drunk while you wait 5+ hours for the game to start. And you can't get up. Because you'll lose your seat
3. Everything is orange (or insert school color)
4. Every pause in the game is a chance to chant something. Like Ill -Ini. Or something for various players. Or, if necessary.. bulllll @#%$....
5. You will high five everyone you know and many, many ppl you don't
6. You will have random drunk boys screaming, dancing, hugging eachother, and yelling LOU HENSON! I'M SOBER! LOU HENSON! HIGH FIVE! GO ILLINI! LOU HENSON! I'M SOBER!
7. You find this amusing.
8. Your friend stands in line from 330-530 and through sheer perserverance gets in. Without slipping the guy at the door a 50.
9. The bar is 30 over capacity at 2:15
10. When your team gets a lead early in the second half, the entire bar screams and yells so much you miss the next three plays.
11. Every point is a cause for celebration.
12. When there's a minute to go you stop watching and start celebrating.
13. Hugging people you don't know is acceptable.
14. Normally shy people will high five everyone they see and hug everyone they see. Without pause.
15. When the bar settles down after 10-15 minutes, you move onto the street.
16. Literally, EVERYONE.
17. You then try not to get trampled. And you cheer the people who climb up onto the lightposts. You also keep your friend by you so that when everyone starts jumping up and down, you have someone to grab when you get pushed too hard.
18. You actually run home to get your camera so you can try to get pictures of the 10000+ ppl packed onto a 2 block seciton of street
19. The policemen don't even bother to do anything but watch
20. On your way home, you find yourself high fiving EVERYONE. And when random guys say 'High five!' and then ""This is too important for a high five! Hug!' You totally don't give it a second thought, even if you are alone on a fairly deserted street corner.
21. You already have planned out which classes you will skip on Monday.
22. You came home to do all your homework for Tuesday in order to camp out again all day Monday.  
23. When your friend says LETS GO RIOT you say OKAY!"

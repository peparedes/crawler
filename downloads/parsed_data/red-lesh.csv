I want them so bad. But I keep refusing to buy some! So then in turn I crave and then I buy other junk food. I feel like I am getting fat again! Time to jump on the low carb boat and keep this weight off. Oh just so you know I had lost 20 pounds.

And it felt great to loose it all!

But that doesnt matter when it comes to the SAT's and ACT's.. I am so screwed. I once was one og the smartest kids in my class! And now I am normal. Anyhow I dont feel like being negative. 

However I will not stop  being spiteful that my sisters are so talented. I think some where along the time of my live journal I have mentioned this before. Actually there is no way that I havent because it has always bothered me. 

Anywho... Recently I have been in the mood to write. Write some poetry, a short story. But every time I turn around I can't find the time. I can fnd the time for this everyonce in awhile. Strange dont you think.

Wel time for me to get going. If I wanna get to the reveiw in time!

My parents seem to think I am some bad daughter. Yes I went some where without asking first that my parents didnt really feel comphy with but thats the first time I have ever done anything like that. And it wasnt exactly a place my parents didnt say I could go. In fact they said I could go several weekends before. So after that my parents have this image of me in a club drinkig a drink with the date rape drug or me doing extasy. Oh and not to mention the fact that my mother was talking to my sister about me and sex. So obviously my mother thinks I am having sex, and she told me I was very permiscious!

So my parents dont really have alot of trust for me right now. Anyways that how it feels. Then once again I am stressing over guys. But you know what this is the first time since Mike. (He asked me to prom several weeks in advanvce then asked another girl three days before...) So this summer I am going to be working at a girlscout camp and working at Auntie Annes and adding it all up, I generally dont have time to do anything. So that means I dont really have time to go out and meet new people including guys. And not to forget I am on resrtiction with guys because I can't date black guys. And I meet Maurice about a month ago. And he really wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with him. But I couldnt just because of the color of his skin.

OKay I know I have rambled on and on but I just needed to release some frustration."

When ever a person would start to dream (their brain activity was probally monitored) they would be awaken from their dream sleep. These people that this was done to started to go insane or crazy which ever you prefer to call it.

I was told that that a theory about dreams is that they are things that are mind can't deal with while we are awake. I think I believe this... Because I was also told that dreams are a continuation of our every day lives. I dont know just something that I find way interesting.

And all I need is some loving... And I don't mean sex. I mean like snuggleing, and liking a person as much as they like me for once. But some other stuff, I wouldnt mind.

I guess friendships are more important than other relationships..."

"event","Well... What can I say? I can be an emotional bitch. And if I don't start my period soon and let the tension slow out I am going to explode!

I think I have problems with it... But I went the the ""female"" doctor and she said that there was not a problem. Well I think there is...

Another thing I was thinking about. I think I don't feel anothing like normal people do."

"event","I am totally upset... I spent a long time writing and my stupid computer loses it. Now I am going to try and grab together what was in my brain several minutes ago and try to rewrite it:

So you have once again caught me in my lil slippers. They might need febrezzing soon... Its kind of an obsession. When ever I can I am wearing them, even when my house is really warm. Maybe they are brain washing me and trying to take over the world... No one would ever find out.

So yeah... Last night I had a bit of a disturbing dream. Actually it was this mourning after I proceeded to turn off my alarm clock... And I noted that it started as I fall back asleep and ended right when I woke up meaning it lasted a half hour.

So now I am thinking to myself this journal will not only be for me to rant and spit. But also to record my dreams. I tend to have very bizarre dreams... I sometimes wish I knew what they meant.

*~*Alecia's Dream*~*
I was with a male, who reminded me greatly of a friend of mine named Jeremy, and I remember clearly that he had stubble from not shaving. We were laying on a bed in what appeared to be my room... He started joking (it seemed) and was trying to kiss me and touch me. I replyed jokingly trying to get him off saying it was gross. But then the joking turned very serious and he tried very hard to toutch me and hurt me in the process. I tried very hard to get him off of me but finally I gave up. Time seemed to pass and I saw nothing that happened to me. The next thing I know that happened, was that I was laying on the bed with this man again. This time my pants were kind of pulled off of me and my shirt wasn't exactly on. The man was stroking the lower part of my back while we watched tv. I seemed to be happy and content with him.
*~*End of Alecia's Dream*~*

Now it might seem sexual... But it did not feel that way to me. It was very odd. Why I found it so weird is that I felt two very strong emotions in this dream; fear and love. And love did not to seem to fit in anywhere.

""Hold fast to dreams. For if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly""-Langston Hughes

I look at this and wonder to myself... What if dreams were the actual key to life and to everything. And what if our dreams are the reality while our reality is just a simple dream?"

"event","God... I am so lost, in a blizzard of my mind. One minute I am with one person and the next the other. I don't know what I want but I have to chose. How can that be a good thing. Should I let go completely or hold on completely? I can't string a person along and make them hurt or confuse them. But then again my stomach is all twisted and knotted in spiraling confusion.

How can I base my feelings on one person because another? Does that make me a ruthless dog? I want to flirt and get to know one but then another comes into play from such a long time ago. 

Its kind of like the movie ""Toy Story""... But then I question myself why do I have such doubts. I doubt myself, I doubt others, I doubt everything. 

Sometimes I just want to punch something. But then again I could never punch someone. But then again I can rip their hearts apart. I am a horrible person. I hate this, I hate confusion, I hate that I can't spell, I hate that I am afraid of commitment, I hate that I can be selfish... I HATE I HATE I HATE...

And while I sit in my lil ducky slippers with my eyes all puffy I wonder... What could be so bad to make me feel like this? What could be so wrong with me to make me hurt every one who seems to get to close?

(WARNING- Some parts are slightly exaggerated, but when I am sad I tend to do that...)"

"event","So its the night after my surprize birthday... It feels weird because I had some many people say happy sweet 16th! And my real birthday isnt till Monday. Dont know just feels weird.

So I am sitting here in my lil ducky slippers (or house shoes) talking to several people... Hmmmmm why do we start liking people who arent very good to be liking? That live forever away or have a girlfriend. I dont know but I do it. Hehe shhh dont tell my friends girlfriend. lol Just kiding!

So anyways I have a big mess to clean up today when every one is out shopping and getting new cloths. Wow that kinda makes me feel like Cinderrella.

Oh oh oh oh! One last thing! I watched the Beauty and the Beast new addition! Very very good!

I liked that it wasn't all Doug Benson not being/being high - you got to see what goes on at dispensaries and whatnot.  If you're at all interested in medical marijuana rights, the effects of marijuana on humans, or stand-up comedians, you should definitely try to get to a screening of it."

Looking up ""where in the world is carmen sandiego"" (I didn't actually use quotes ... maybe that was the problem) gave me many images, mostly not related to Carmen Sandiego.  The best ones were a screenshot from ""Secretary,"" Brian Peppers, and what appeared to be a merkin.

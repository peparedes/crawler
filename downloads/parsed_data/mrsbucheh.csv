Doesn't it look beautiful? :) Ok, that is all. I hope that you like the icon. :) Good night!

Fyi, the text in the icon says ""sumetai yume no naka de."" From what I know, that means ""inside a cold dream"" or something like that. o_o It's from the Loveless opening song. :D Yay for Loveless."

"event","I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. 

My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. 

My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. 

It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. 
One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. 

She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. 

She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. 

I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. 

With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.

10 FRIENDS...

1. Girl. GUSTAVOOOOOOOO! I love this girl. What would I do with her? This bio loving, anime crazy, hyesung hater, tezuka-kakashi loving, ""I HAVE TO GO PEE, KYUNGIEEEE...WHAT DO I DO????"", BIG ASS, and many other words to describe her. She's smart, amazing, wonderful, and capable of doing anything. Couldn't ask for more.

2. Guy. I have too much fun with this person. Hes hilarious because hes so oblivious to everything and he is probably one of the most loyalist ppl that you'll ever meet. He helps you on everything and is just TOO nice. I've known him for about 3 years and he is just awesome.

3. Girl. Shes a tough person on the outside but on the inside I know shes a sweetie. Shes been through A LOT of HARD things in life but shes still strong. We haven't always had a steady friendship but were still close. Shes a wonderful person who has the most sickest dance moves and the only person who has probably seen me trip over the speed bump. I love our own language that we have and her brother and sister.

4. Guy. I met him last year. He makes me happy and I couldn't ask for more. <3

5. Girl. I met her in 8th grade. Shes so fun to be around with. She is always ready to listen to whatever you have to say. She's crazy smart and always makes you laugh. Going to Ohlone on the bus was fun because of all the embarrasing things that happened to us. 
TOKI, MAIPHAN, KIRBY, Mr. Rice, PRETTY BOY XD

6.  Girl. I've had so much fun adventures with her. I've known her since 6th grade. Last year we did almost everything together. Shes so fun to be around with and always makes you laugh. Were not as close as before because of some issues that came up but I don't regret anything in the past. We had lots of fun together and she will always be someone special.

7. Guy. This person is someone that I haven't known for a really long time but hes a great person. Hes always fun to talk to. He probably won't know that this is about him or maybe he will? Iono..but anyways hes a very talented and amazing person.

8. Girl. This girl is so sweet, cute, and scary...yesterday's lunch line? LOL. I've known her about 4-5 years and we have had so much fun together. She always has different hair everyday and always stares at me to see if I can ""feel"" like shes watching me. Shes awesome.

9. Girl. I met her Ivy. I LOVE THIS GIRl. SHE IS SO AWESOME AND I LOVE HER LAUGH AND TEACHER HANDWRITING. Enough said.

10. Guy. I met him through #9. I've only known him for like..5 months BUT he is one of the coolest people you can ever meet. :) My e-mail is sorta messed up so I can't e-mail him but hes online once in a while. He likes naruto. Hes smart. He likes hyori and boa. sweet."

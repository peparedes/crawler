"event","Hello, everyone.

It has indeed been a long, long time. I never could get much into this whole livejournal thing. I guess I should, though. Now that I'm a working girl, I don't have as many chances to reflect on life as I did while I was in college. In some ways it almost seems like college was one long extended reflection on life. I feel much more enlightened now, but I think reflection has to be an ongoing thing, or we almost forget how to do it.

Things have been going okay for me. I'm not as tired as I was through my years in school. The nice thing about not being in classes is that I don't always have work hanging over my head. I have deadlines at work, but for the most part I can forget about them when 5:00 hits. Then I can go home and relax. Although relaxing usually takes the form of zoning out in front of the TV.

Living in the city is kind of boring to me. I know that some people might find it exciting, but it's a bit too fast-paced for me. People aren't that nice, and everything is expensive, and there's a perpetual cloud of smog hanging over my apartment building.

I guess it seems to me that there has to be more to life than this. It seems like I'm waiting for a sign that my real life is about to begin. I don't think I've ever been truly happy with where I am in my life. I'm always waiting for something bigger or better to come along.

I'm not really sure how to change that."

And you know what? When I'm shopping for a business suit, I really don't want to be questioned by a pimply guy about my pet gerbil. Okay?

Man, is it time for summer to be OVER."

"event","I'm not too sure how I feel about Father's Day. I didn't send my dad a card. Didn't even call him, in fact. But you know, I don't feel too terribly guilty about that, seeing as how he hasn't called or sent cards for my last three birthdays. I don't really consider him a part of my life anymore. I don't even think of him as ""Dad."" He's just...well, just Steve. A perfect stranger to me.

He could be a part of my life if he wanted to be. He just doesn't want to.

Even if he asked to be let back into my life...well, I guess I would let him. Not really as a father figure, though. Probably more as a friend. A peer. An acquaintance. I just don't think I'll ever be able to see him as a nurturing, supporting figure again. He's had plenty of chances to redeem himself in that area, and he just hasn't.

In other news, the job is going okay. I'm a little nervous about the coming year. I know it's still a couple months away, but it still seems like it's coming way too fast. I, Bridget Matthews, will be entering the real world.

I have no idea if I'm ready to face it. But I'm going to, like it or not."

"event","Hey everybody. Been a while since I updated, but things are going okay. Working my 40 hrs a week at Eddie Bauer. Kinda boring, except when people get mad at me when stuff is out of stock. Not doing too much in the evenings, the occasional hangout with Kat, but pretty much just reading and hanging around the house. Not sure how much longer I can go on like this. Summer always drives me crazy. Nobody's around, there's not much to do (by oneself anyway). Don't know where I'm headed next. Well, talk to you all soon."

"event","Today I went to the zoo with Kat and Mike. It was actually a lot of fun. We saw these really cute baby seals, and a rather disgruntled-looking zebra. The lions, of course, were the most magnificent. And it was an absolutely perfect day. Seventy degrees, not a cloud in the sky. Just walking around, not a care in the world...I could get to like this.

Too bad that work (and reality) set in starting next week. Ah well, this was nice while it lasted."

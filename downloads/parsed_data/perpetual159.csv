The truth is, I dread finding out just how rusty my mushy writing skills have gotten. I do technical writing for a living, and it would just be sooooo lame if I ended up writing a &quot;How to Be the Ultimate NaruHina Shipper&quot; manual, instead. Yes, that is how bad it&#39;s gotten. u__u</p><p>And so, in the event I do find out my muse it&#39;s in no mood to write mushiness, with this challenge, my success or my failure (depending on how things turn out) will be open to the public. D: In other words, I cannot make any excuses! I must complete the challenge! &gt;(</p><p>But, as with everything else in life, I must start with baby steps. The challenge consists of seven words. In other words, each word will be a prompt. I will write anywhere from 100 - 500 words (or maybe more if my muse gets outta hand, since, Lord only knows how wordy I am!) for each word. I will complete a word a day, thus a week of NaruHina goodness (or badness, depending on who you ask, lulz ~_~).</p><p>For this challenge, I will need your help selecting these words. If you&#39;re a tumblr user, reply (and reblog to spread the word) to this entry with a word. You may submit as many words as you want, but they cannot be the same word again and again. I will accept words for a whole week, meaning, next Sunday (or Monday, if you&#39;re in the east side of the Greenwich Meridian) is the last day to submit words. Click the respective links if you&#39;re a <a href=""http://perpetual159.livejournal.com/37690.html"">LJ</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=""http://perpetual159.deviantart.com/journal/#/d5eahdf"">deviantART</a>&nbsp;user to submit words through there.</p><p>I will write each submitted word in a little piece of paper and then randomly draw one each day from some sort of container (it wouldn&#39;t be a challenge if I got to pick them!).&nbsp;</p><p>After I complete the challenge, I will dedicate myself to finish all my WIP stories. With this challenge, the hope is that I can get into the habit of writing an average of at least 300 words a day. At that rate, I can finish all my stories before the year&#39;s out. Sounds fair, right?!</p><p>If you&#39;re a lazy NH writer like me and need some form of encouragement to get your shit together, I invite you to take this challenge with me! The more the merrier! :D Because, seriously, besides Jupitrie&#39;s <a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8426098/1/The-Fifth-and-Sixth-Jidai"">latest story</a>. it is my understanding that our community is quite dead these days!

"event","Why do people make such a big deal about the way other people dress? To me it&#39;s never made any sense, but maybe that&#39;s because I simply wear what&#39;s comfortable.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I see people dressed a certain way, one or more of the following may (if I am really paying attention because 99% of the time I got better things to worry about) go through my head:<ul><li>That&#39;s a nice outfit</li><li>That&#39;s not a nice outfit</li><li>That looks comfortable/uncomfortable</li><li>Those are nice shoes/T-shirt/pants, etc.</li></ul>Am I going to think you&#39;re an awesome person or a terrible person because of that? No. Clothes are just that: Clothes. I don&#39;t know who you are, so what gives me the right to think you&#39;re this way or that way just because of you&#39;re wearing this or that?&nbsp;<br /><br />Your clothes do NOT determine that you&#39;re good or bad at something, that you&#39;re this way or that way. Yeah, some people make what they wear their personal billboard, and that&#39;s fine, but that&#39;s NOT everybody. Your clothes do not define whether you&#39;re:<br /><ul><li>confident</li><li>insecure</li><li>trying toooooo hard to impress</li><li>are a slut</li><li>are a convict</li><li>Etc... (i.e. all the shit people judge others for)</li></ul>Thus, I fail to understand how it is that people think that it is the clothes is what makes the man (or woman), or why people think that the way you dress is a reflection of yourself. I mean, what about uniforms? Or dress-codes? Yeah, yeah... those things reflect a business or institution, yadda yadda yadda, but that&#39;s all it does. It does not indicate that you&#39;re smart or stupid, or what have you. The way people dress does not tell you all the things people like to believe it tells you.<br /><br />If you dress like a bum,does that mean you&#39;re lazy and lack confidence, and poor as hell? No.<br /><br />If you dress like a super model, that does not mean you&#39;re filthy rich, and confident? No.<br /><br />I like to dress comfortably--when I buy clothes, I have practicality in mind; in other words, I&#39;m not going out of my way to make a statement.&nbsp;Apparently, though, since I dress comfortably, I fall under the &quot;bum&quot; category. Makes no sense, though. I&#39;m not lazy, I&#39;m fairly confident in myself, and I am very financially secure. The only time I go out of my way to shop for clothes is because they eventually become dysfunctional. Like, I wait until shit starts falling apart.<br /><br />To give another example, I&#39;ve met people who are super smart, confident, and a bunch of other attributes that people would consider favorable, but then there&#39;s one so-called &quot;problem&quot;: they dress like bums. And, since they dress like bums--and therefore are lazy--then why is their house/desk/car/you name it sparkling clean? If we&#39;re going to judge, isn&#39;t messiness a sign of laziness?<br /><br />Likewise, I&#39;ve come across people who look &quot;so good,&quot; they look as if they fell right out of fashion magazine, but guess what: they&#39;re dumb as a rock!<br /><br />So what gives? I find the whole fashion thing incredibly misleading.&nbsp;<br /><br />Perhaps I&#39;m just so clueless about this whole thing because I like to be practical and I like to feel comfortable. If I wear something that &quot;looks good&quot; yet it&#39;s uncomfortable as hell, then you better believe it I&#39;m going to be so cranky, I&#39;ll be unbearable.<br /><br />I know that whether we like to admit it or not, we all judge... there&#39;s no getting around that. But when it comes to clothing... I really just don&#39;t care. Personally, I have bigger priorities than looking as if I fell out of Vanity Fair. Likewise, I&#39;m going to like (or not like you) because of who you are, not because of what you decided to wear.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I go to work, I go to work. I don&#39;t go with the intention to parade along the hallways of the building pretending I&#39;m on a catwalk. If I&#39;m going to the store to get some milk and bread real quick, then I&#39;m not going beyond making sure I&#39;m clean. If my job didn&#39;t have a dress-code, I&#39;d wear the same thing I wear everywhere else--jeans and a T-shirt.<br /><br />At work, it&#39;s &quot;business-casual&quot;, but then when some big wig is visiting, all of a sudden it&#39;s &quot;business professional&quot; because that gives a &quot;good image.&quot; But I say: so what if it does? For all we know, despite the &quot;good image&quot;, the place is maybe being run by a bunch of jack-asses. Having a bunch of people looking &quot;business&nbsp;professional&quot; does not make &#39;em business-like, let alone professional. It&#39;s nothing but an illusion... an illusion that we like to blind ourselves with. Reality is always different.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was in the military, and although the uniforms looked &quot;sharp&quot;, believe me when I tell you this, I worked with quite a few morons that did not fit the profile that the uniform tried to &quot;represent&quot;.&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all, clothes do not make the men (or woman) for me. Your actions (and, occasionally, what comes out of your mouth) does.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#39;m not against looking good in an outfit. If you do look good wearing a certain outfit, that&#39;s perfectly fine. But I&#39;m not thinking anything beyond &quot;That&#39;s a nice outfit.&quot; I&#39;m not going to think &quot;You look good therefore you must be smart, and hardworking.&quot; Likewise, if you look bad wearing a certain outfit, that&#39;s perfectly fine, too. I&#39;m not going to think &quot;You look like shit, therefore you must be insecure and lazy.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway!<br /><br />/end rant!<br />"

"event","Failed... utterly so.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#39;m having trouble with the thesis... the damned prompt for this paper is so broad it makes my eyes twirl. All day I&#39;ve had a brainfart, so I decided that if I&#39;m going to do any writing, it would be here, even if it&#39;s nothing but nonsense.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking at the school plan I&#39;ve made for myself... it&#39;s going to take me five to six years to graduate at the pace I&#39;m going, if my calculations (full time work, life, etc.) are correct. It&#39;s hard to believe that I&#39;m going to be 27 and that I&#39;ve lally-gagged all this time. I try to look back and think about what I&#39;ve been doing with my time, and it&#39;s just =____=&nbsp;<br /><br />Every time I think about this, I keep asking myself if I&#39;m really doing it for me, or because it&#39;s what my family wants me to do, particularly my mum and my step-dad, what with them being teachers and all (they place very high emphasis on education, as you can imagine).<br /><br />All things considered, I <i>am</i> doing it for me--at the end of the day, I&#39;ll be the one who&#39;ll benefit from it all, and not my parents, but I keep wondering... I AM fairly successful in my life right now, so do I really need to bust my ass and get a degree so that I can start from scratch all over again? But then... what I&#39;m doing for a living these days is not something I particularly enjoy, so if I am going to do something with my life, it better be something that I see myself enjoying, and I better start now, not when I&#39;m 40 years old or something. I mean, I have nothing against the people who wake up and smell the coffee that late in life, because, really, better late than never! My hat goes off to them, in fact, because that takes major balls! I can&#39;t even imagine how difficult it can be after you&#39;ve been out of school for so long.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, in the meantime, I&#39;ll continue to drive on. I&#39;ve already started, and when I decided I would start sometime this summer (as in, I told myself that this time I would do it for reals), I told myself that I would not stop until I&#39;m done. Yes, that means even summer school. I really gotta focus and do something with my life besides doing just enough to get by; I&#39;ve had enough of sitting in limbo and not knowing what to make of myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />No more distractions, no more &quot;But I&#39;m le tired&quot; to quote the French from a certain youtube video I watched a while back, lol, and no more bullshit.&nbsp;<br /><br />Future milestones include studying that Compass test book, because I&#39;ll be damned if I fail that Math placement test and endup having to take remedial classes! Math may not be one of my strengths, but I&#39;m not letting that stop me.<br /><br />As for the immediate future, tomorrow (or today, since it&#39;s already past midnight), first thing in the morning, I&#39;m going to get up, get some IHOP, and get that paper done!<br /><br />FUTURE, here I come!<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/s/t/studytimeplz.gif"" /><br />"

"event","Dear Almanac,

Would you believe that I was well on my way to dreamland, but I had forgotten to turn down the volume of my phone&rsquo;s ringer, and to my misfortune, it went off, notifying me of a new email I received. Needless to say, the email I received was absolutely pointless, and not worth getting startled out of my journey into blissful sleep, but what&rsquo;s done is done. Now I lay awake in bed, envious of Prieto who, despite spending 90% of his day sleeping, is carelessly sleeping once again to his heart&rsquo;s content next to me. I wish I had the power of a cat to sleep regardless of noises, or however many hours I had already slept throughout my day. 

That&rsquo;s beside the point of writing this entry, however. Right now I am just&hellip; well, I&rsquo;ve had a lot in my mind. But before I continue, my beloved Almanac, please keep in mind that this entry will be incoherent at best. Right now I doubt I have the energy to write anything that makes sense.&nbsp; At any rate, returning to the topic at hand: I&rsquo;ve always had a lot on my mind, but I keep wondering if what&rsquo;s happening to me is that, as the days go by, the more complicated my life becomes. I wonder if I&rsquo;m the one that&rsquo;s complicating it, or if this is something that everyone goes through. I used to think that, all things considered, I knew all I needed to know given my age, and the things I had experienced to date, but that is no longer the case anymore. Or, well, that statement is not necessarily accurate. You see, it wasn&rsquo;t that I knew all I needed to know; it was more that I knew a lot of things, and although there was a lot more that I could learn, I really wasn&rsquo;t that much in hurry to learn them. Is that what you call blissful ignorance? I don&rsquo;t think so, but there may be some truth to that. Like I said, I don&rsquo;t expect to make much sense when I&rsquo;m sleep deprived and my mind is swirling with God knows how many different thoughts a second. The point is that as of late, I haven&rsquo;t been as complacent as I used to be. On the contrary, it&rsquo;s been nearly impossible to satiate this sudden hunger for knowledge, and just&hellip; I feel like I want to digest so many things, but&hellip; I&rsquo;m just one person&hellip; with one brain that can only handle so much. What&rsquo;s worse, I want to veg out as much as I want to learn; I want to sleep as much as I want to read; I want to run as much as I want to sit. At this point, my life seems to make little sense, and this frustrates me to no end. I try to be pragmatic about things, but I end up frustrating myself even more because, even if I&rsquo;m being practical, my impatience is hell-bent on not allowing me to appreciate my efficiency in getting things done. I think of the adage (if it can even be called that) my drill sergeant used to say when I was in basic training&mdash;&ldquo;Slow is smooth, smooth is fast&rdquo;&mdash;but his wisdom has been failing me lately, and it sucks! It sucks absolute balls.

This state of chaos&mdash;when looking at it from a rational perspective, I suppose&mdash;seems absolutely ridiculous, and well&hellip; pointless. How can I desire sleep so much but want to read pages on end, or how can I run mile after mile when I just want to sit on my ass all day? What&rsquo;s worse is that I don&rsquo;t want to make up my mind about what I want to do. I know what the better option is, and I know that if done in moderation, a lot of things in life are possible, but lately I&rsquo;ve been making the worse choise: doing nothing. Sleeping and sitting down to think about the things I want to do, but don&rsquo;t will myself to. And given this problem, the sensible part of me urges me to be reasonable, to continue following the system of living my life that I&rsquo;ve been following up to this point because it is effective, because I&rsquo;ve accomplished a great deal with it so far; because if I continue with it, I will continue to succeed in my endeavors and so on and so on, because if I don&rsquo;t, then I&rsquo;ll turn out being the kind of person I have no respect for: an absolute nobody with nothing to show for. However, the irrational, rebellious side of me has something completely different in mind. It is tired. It has had enough of routines, of lists, of goals, of rules, of living in a constant state of repression because the bigger picture is what matters in the long run, and because routines, lists, goals, rules and whatever is what makes me function like a semi-normal human being and stop me from being that nobody that I would hate to become. But this rebellious side of me is persistent. It claims it just wants to live. It just wants to be free. It just wants to act without having to consider the consequences of whatever actions it may indulge in. 

Then I realize that, whether I&rsquo;m willing to admit it or not, I&rsquo;ve always been in a constant state of chaos. The difference is that I&rsquo;m good at suppressing it; I&rsquo;m good at pretending this problem doesn&rsquo;t exist, or at least keeping it somewhere in the back of my head where I don&rsquo;t have to think about it. After all, who cares, right? As long as I get where I want to be, the problems can take a back seat, because shit needs to get done&mdash;the big picture is what&rsquo;s important! But&hellip; do I even really want to be where I think I want to be? I like to think I know where that place and/or state of being is, but ask me right now, and I&rsquo;m guaranteed to sit back, and think of a response for hours on end, and still not come up with a solid answer, and that&rsquo;s because I really don&rsquo;t know. I only have bits and pieces of dreams&hellip; bits and pieces of passion&hellip; but never the whole&hellip; thing&hellip; I guess. It&rsquo;s disappointing when I face this reality. It&rsquo;s&hellip; so dejecting and, well, depressing and pathetic. I really do try not to think about it this way. I tell myself again and again to not think about it this way, that the fact I have nothing should in fact encourage me to find what that dream and passion is. Sometimes it works; I believe my own words, but deep down inside, a part of me tells me that I&rsquo;m just lying to myself, that I know better, and thus I can never truly be content. 

I am not giving up, however. Even if for that one split second I wonder if my life really has any meaning only to stop myself from considering this thought any further, I know there is something out there for me that I must do, that I am here for a reason beyond what I have planned for my life. I know I have a purpose, even if I haven&rsquo;t figured it out. If I don&rsquo;t figure it out, if I reach old age still trying to find out what that is, then it is not a life in vain. Despite the frustrations that rebellious side in me awakens day after day, I at least know that it is there for a reason, if anything but to keep me awake, even if lazily awake, it is there to keep me on my toes, and not let my life pass me by.

I&rsquo;m not giving up. Come what may, I&rsquo;m not giving up."

"event","Jeez, there is always, <em>always </em>something to do. This week has been just... non-stop. 

I am glad it's Friday. 

Today I got out of work late; since I've moved within the project to a new position, I've been so busy it's not even funny. In a way, this is good. It's been a long time since I've felt productive at work. My last position really was a joke in terms of productivity, so it's nice to once again feel useful. On the other hand, training can get exhausting sometimes... you just absorb so much information that after a while, your brain feels like shutting down. 

On Wednesday I finally started performing my job for real. Regrettably, all the training I've undergone does not cover even half my duties, but it's a start. Though it still kind of sucks... but it often happens when there really isn't an official training program developed for the position. You just get thrown in and are expected to learn your way as you go along. What's making it even harder is that I work in a team where one person is relatively new, so there is only so much she can tell me, the other person has been there for a while, but getting information out of her is like pulling teeth, so after a while I feel like I'm annoying her 'cuz I keep asking her stuff, and the person who REALLY&nbsp;knows everything works in an entirely different floor.&nbsp; However, I am managing, all things considered. Besides the training I'm receiving at work, I also bought a couple of books related to my job that I am reading on my own time to get a better understanding of what I'm testing. One book is over 1000 pages, and the other is about three hundred pages. I'm reading at least two chapters a day, right after work, so... even more information to bombard my brain with. Ever since I started working there, I've been crashing at 8-9pm every night like a total granny... jeez. 

I'm a Quality Assurance Specialist now... free from my language-driven career-field at last. Now I get to make sure that this ginormous database is working as expected, as well as the software interface that the database is accessed through. Generally, this kind of job is considered to be very boring, but for people that are very good at noticing errors, paying attention to details, testing the hell out of things to make sure they work as they are supposed to, and are <em>very</em> thorough about everything, this is sort of a match made in heaven. 

Additionally, as a Quality Assurance person, you're also the one that all the system engineers and software developers hate because, technically speaking, nobody likes being told their shit is wrong, especially after you've spent days and even weeks writing some fancy code for some software, etc. LOL... in fact, as soon as I started working there, everyone pretty much told me &quot;people are going to hate you pretty soon, so get used to it.&quot; =____= great. Oh, well, if it pays the bills... so be it. ^_^;;

Yesterday and today, however, I've been taking a break from the massive books I'm reading, and instead I've been writing fanfiction. I was really shocked with how agreeable my mojo's been these last couple of days. That's not to say that the story I'm writing right now (yes, something completely new... I know... as if I don't already have enough in-progress crap!) is absolutely amazing. In fact, this story is intended to be just some light reading, so maybe that's why it's coming along so easily. I'm hoping to get it done before the month's out, but as always, I don't recommend anyone to hold their breath. 

Anyway, the real reason why I'm writing this entry is because when I was having dinner, Hotel California began playing. 

That is one great song. 

It suddenly reminded me of my dad... not because he is still in California, or because he ever lived the fast life (as the lyrics explain), but because he was the one who taught me how to appreciate classic rock. He's a really big fan, and when I was younger and we'd be driving around in some random California highway, he'd always play his classic rock collection and crank up the volume. I'm not very close to my dad, so this is one of the very few fond memories I have of him. Thinking about it in retrospect, perhaps the reason I'm not close to him is because I'm a lot like him--or so I keep being told--which really kind of annoys me because there are a million and a half traits in my dad's personality that drive me crazy, but I guess it can't be helped. Perhaps this is because we're so alike, and, well... have you ever heard the saying that if you knew someone that was EXACTLY like you, you'd probably couldn't stand to be in the same room? Yep... you catch my drift. 

But anyway, going back to classic rock... another thing my dad used to often do when I was still young and lived with him in California was wake up at some God-awful hour early in the morning, and, once again, crank up the radio with some classic rock. It was his own retarded way of saying &quot;Good morning, get the hell up!&quot; Gaaaawd, we used to all hate it!&nbsp;Sometimes we just ignored him, or at least I did, throwing the pillow over my head and attempting to go back to sleep with very little success. Eventually I'd drag my ass out of bed and go downstairs only to find that it wasn't just some random CD he'd popped in the radio, but VH1 Classic that he was watching, feeding the sound from them music videos to his massive entertainment center. lol... that was a typical Saturday morning at home. Good ol' days, I guess, haha. 

At any rate, listening to Hotel California gave me the urge to find the video, and surprisingly I couldn't find it in YouTube. Thankfully, that's what Google is for!&nbsp;^_^

"event","Dear Almanac,    <p class=""MsoNormal"">I suppose you must be wondering what I&rsquo;m doing up at this time of day. Well, you see, earlier today&mdash;after I had cooked, and watched Driving Miss Daisy (which by the way is a sweet film that I had been meaning to watch for the longest time, yay for Netflix!)&mdash;at around 5-6PM, I decided to &ldquo;lay down&rdquo; for a little bit and relax before I had to stand up again and do the dishes, because, you know, I cooked some dinner, and all that jazz. Needless to say, I hadn&rsquo;t planned on falling asleep, but I did (like a total grandma) until it was&hellip; um&hellip; 10:15PM or so, thus here I am&hellip; it&rsquo;s 15 minutes &lsquo;til midnight, and I know tomorrow at work it&rsquo;s going to suck balls &lsquo;cuz&hellip; it&rsquo;s just going to suck balls, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/w/h/whatdaplz.png"" /></p>At any rate, I figured that tonight I&rsquo;d elaborate on all those &ldquo;future stories&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been promising in past entries, so here we go!&nbsp;<br /><br /> <lj-cut><span style=""font-size: large;""><b style="""">New Home</b>&nbsp;</span>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Why, yes, Mr. Almanac, I&rsquo;m sure you have been wondering about that. I keep talking about decks, and backyards, and so on when you&rsquo;re used to me talking about apartment this and apartment that. Well, that is because on February 1<sup>st</sup> of this year, I bought a single home. My very own lub nest, oooooh, mai! I know, I know&hellip; people keep telling me it&rsquo;s quite the accomplishment for someone my age, but the truth is that&hellip; well&hellip; I kind of did it on a whim, you know? A few of my older and wiser friends had for the longest time been encouraging me to buy a home, but for some reason I never felt ready to make such a commitment&hellip; or I guess I just wasn&rsquo;t serious about it. I really can&rsquo;t be sure what the reason was&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I ever knew what all the reasons for not doing it were, but now that it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s not as big of a deal as I thought would be, I guess. Just like everything in life, owning a home has its advantages and disadvantages, and besides the obvious reasons that are pretty universal for every homeowner (equity, etc.), I suppose I&rsquo;ll list some of them that affect me on a personal level:<br /><b style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advantages:<br /></b></p>      <ul><li>Privacy. Yes&hellip; and plenty of it.</li><li>Peace. Also plenty of it, especially since it&rsquo;s a single home. When I lived in an apartment, I preferred living in the first level, so it always sucked when I had elephant neighbors or people with marching-band syndrome living above.</li><li>Freedom. My favorite part so far. I can listen to music and/or watch movies as loud as I want, as long as I want, and as late as I want without disturbing anyone.</li><li>Space. My home is small by standards, but since it&rsquo;s just me, it&rsquo;s perfect. I don&rsquo;t like huge houses; that just means more work when you have to clean up. <ul><li>Additionally, you never have to fight with neighbors for parking spots when you decide to get home late or for whatever other reason, you know? Your driveway is your own, and no one can just up and park in it.</li></ul></li></ul><b style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disadvantages</b><span style=""font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""""><span style=""font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;""><br /></span></span></span><ul><li>You&rsquo;re on your own when something needs to get done. You don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;maintenance guy&rdquo; to just show up when a power outlet needs to be fixed or replaced, or if your AC unit decides to crap out on you in the middle of summer for no apparent reason. You always have to be prepared for these kinds of expenses, so more savings, and less spending money.</li><li>Keeping your home clean and maintaining it is a LOT of work, especially for one person, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s home, so I find that I&rsquo;m more willing to do it because this is <em><b style="""">my</b></em> home. I guess, to put it in simple terms, you do it with love and more enthusiasm as opposed to just some apartment. That&rsquo;s not to say I was indifferent or filthy when I lived in an apartment, but I was never in a rush to get things done if they needed to be done. Nowadays, (it&rsquo;s kind of funny how things work), if the house is messy, I get really cranky, so I always keep it clean.</li><li>Commute. I used to live really close to work when I lived in an apartment. Regrettably, work is in a somewhat expensive location (at least for my budget), so I have about an 18-mile commute. Now you must be thinking, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so bad, Pet-chan.&rdquo; Well&hellip; this is Washington DC, my silly little Almanac. An 18-mile commute can easily turn into two hours stuck in a car for no apparent reason other than there just being too much damn people and so little space.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully, I&rsquo;m a morning person, so I go to work early (6AM, yikes!) and get out at 2PM, so I get to skip out on most of the traffic action <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/l/ilikeitplz.png"" /></li></ul>        <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: large;""><b style="""">Tractor Neighbor</b></span></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Heh! When I moved to my epic lub nest, I discovered that one of my neighbors has a tractor parked in his front yard. Now, you can&rsquo;t really see it because there are some trees hiding it sorta kinda from plain sight, but you can see it from my place. I always find it quite amusing, and if I&rsquo;m feeling judgmental and ignorant, I call my neighbor my hick/redneck neighbor. You see, I&rsquo;ve only waved to my neighbors so far&hellip; lol&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know their names. I&rsquo;ve never even seen my tractor neighbor, and the ones on the other side&hellip; well, seems like either they are just a bunch of roommates, or at least two families living in that house &lsquo;cuz there&rsquo;s lots of people there, and there&rsquo;s some dudes that kind of creep me out, so I keep to myself *shrugs*</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: large;""><b style="""">My Future Husband</b></span></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ah, well&hellip; how do I explain this one, my dear Almanac? Well, long story short, my future husband is <lj user=""eternalshiva""/>&nbsp;&rsquo;s son,&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/e/h/eheheplz.gif"" /> Well, you see, he&rsquo;s just so darn cute!<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Coming from me, that says a lot since I&rsquo;m no baby person. But my future husband&hellip; oh, man&hellip; he activates my practically non-existent girly gaga gene like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe. Consequently, since he&rsquo;s still in diapers, and I&rsquo;m no pedo, I gotta wait &lsquo;til he&rsquo;s of legal age so I can marry him like the total cougar I&rsquo;ll be by that time. LOL! At first eternalshiva was all &ldquo;WTF iz you talking about!&rdquo; but now we all just laugh about it, and even SHE calls him my future husband, hahahaha. <lj user=""tempestamorte""/> &nbsp;, on the other hand, just gives me an &quot;OMG EWW <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/m/omgewplz.png"" />&quot; look and shakes her head, lmfao! I love you, Gi-chaaaaaan! <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/c/h/chuplz.png"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So those are all the &ldquo;Future Stories&rdquo; in a nutshell.

"event","Dear Almanac,  <p class=""MsoNormal"">My apologies for writing such an entry... usually I don't indulge in such behavior, but today... I think it's okay.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">But, if anything... I hope you don&rsquo;t mind. D:<br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""So... here we go!""><p class=""MsoNormal"">This weekend about the only good news I got was from <lj user=""tempestamorte""/>&nbsp;, who told my favorite band of all time, L&rsquo;Arc~en~Ciel will come the United States next year, and that <lj user=""eternalshiva""/>  is back to writing epic pr0nz! Beyond that, it was one bullshit after another. <br /><br />First let&rsquo;s begin with my iPod. <br /><br />It broke. <br /><br />That piece of shit! &nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/v/o/voodooplz.gif"" /><br /><br />I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, why must people always be so ungrateful and illogical when they&rsquo;re pissed&hellip; that I was perfectly happy with it while it was working fine, blah blah blah&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s human nature to be irrational in such situations.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The ultimate source of human stupidity, and, believe me, I <strong><em>know</em></strong>. for I&rsquo;ve fallen prey to it more times than I should. I know better that,when you act in the midst of anger, bad shit always happens.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So&hellip; all of Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning I spent fucking around with the iPod, trying to figure out what was wrong with it. The only thing I managed to fix was 29.7GB&rsquo;s of its 160GB hard drive&mdash;yes, I have a large music collection&mdash;and, well, this would simply not do.&nbsp;<img alt="""" style=""width: 37px; height: 37px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/h/ihateitplz.png"" /> <br /><br />After countless attempts to try to wipe the iPod&rsquo;s hard drive and having this or that error making such action result in absolute failure, I finally threw in the towel (No, my silly little Almanac&hellip; restoring the iPod did nothing. iTunes is made of so much fail, it&rsquo;s not even funny). God knows all the hissy fits I threw over this stupid iPod, or to be more accurate, &quot;Paperweight.&quot; You can ask <lj user=""eternalshiva""/>&nbsp; about it. She had to sit through most of it, and the poor soul was so excited about getting her mojo back, but there I&nbsp;was...&nbsp; toooooo busy being a cranky pain in the ass.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/s/i/sighingplz.gif"" /> She&rsquo;s such an epic friend&hellip; really, it&rsquo;s because of friends like her that slowly but surely I&rsquo;ve learned that the only people who can really be my friends are those who are willing to forgive my retardism and borderline sociopath tendencies, and of that, <lj user=""eternalshiva""/>&nbsp; has PLENTY of experience.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, so yesterday I go to the Apple store, because you know&hellip; them bitches lured me in not only with the .mp3 player monopoly they control (Sourgrapes101 is the only person in the world I know that doesn&rsquo;t own an iPod, lawlz&hellip; way to put his business out in the open, huh!), but also with the 10% discount I would get when I exchanged my piece of shit paperweight&mdash;I mean!... old iPod&hellip;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So I exchange it&hellip; they gave me a silver iPod and didn&rsquo;t even ask me. In my head, I was all &ldquo;WTF,&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/n/onionnouplz.gif"" /> my old iPod was black! I want it black, dammit!&rdquo; but I was too much of a pussy to speak up. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t even know if they carry the iPod classic in black anymore, and at this point in time it's pointless to find out. But then&hellip; I figured it didn&rsquo;t really matter, and, looking at the bright side of things, now my iPod matches with Mr. Silver (my car&hellip; can you guess the color, my dear gullible Almanac? Lol&hellip; probably not *pats in the head* <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/m/immastupidplz.png"" />).</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">After I&rsquo;m done dumping $300 (2-year warranty included, I&rsquo;m such a sucker! <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/n/onionfailplz.gif"" />) into Steve Job&rsquo;s pocket&mdash;as if he needs my money, tche!&mdash;I go into this sushi place for lunch, and you see, my beloved Almanac&hellip; don&rsquo;t believe all the hype about sushi. If you become a sushi snob like me, you will soon discover that most sushi places are absolute overpriced crap. Like, seriously&hellip; what is it with sushi restaurant owners&hellip; just because you own a sushi restaurant that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can rip people off with shitty rolls overstuffed with rice, sour cream, and a pice of fish smaller than a penny. What&rsquo;s worse was the they even fucked up the miso soup. How much of a lousy cook do you have to be to fuck up miso soup? Oh, and don&rsquo;t even get me started on their Katsu-don. <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/v/o/vomitplz.gif"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">I finally went home and the rest of the day went mostly uneventful with me dumping over 6,000 songs into my new iPod (and I'm not even done!). I spent a long time doing this and did not go to bed until sometime after 11PM. Needless to say, since I go to work VERY early, I knew my day would be rather painful. Surprisingly, I didn&rsquo;t have any problem getting up,<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>but when I was at work&hellip; man&hellip; as Shikamaru would say&hellip; what a drag&hellip; and quite literally. <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/l/a/lazyonion.gif"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Being that I got a new job title, I have the fortune of being tasked with boring, super dry training. However, when I start my training, the server where I&rsquo;m supposed to conduct such training doesn&rsquo;t feel like cooperating, and to my luck, the only guy who can fix it is off for the day&mdash;something about being sick. <br /><br />So there I was with nothing to do, and since you know me so well, my dear Almanac, you are very much right to assume that I HATE sitting there with nothing to do. So, me, being the dork that I am, I go to this very nice lady who&rsquo;s always got plenty to do, so I ask her if she needs help in something, and she does, but hey, first she has to teach me how stuff works, so she does (or more like attempts to do so), and then lunch time comes along. I decide to go visit Miles (my partner in crime from my last job) and we catch up, and blab all kinds of nonsense.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/e/h/eheheplz.gif"" /> I only visited for about 15 minutes, and when I come back, the stupid server is still down (over six hourrs, wtf!), and I go to the nice lady to continue showing me stuff, and she does, but after a while we call it a day because she doesn&rsquo;t want to overwhelm me with too much information, and then once again I find myself with nothing to do. However, me being the little productive wannabe busy body that I am, I decide to log on to the intranetz to look up a book on XML, because a lot of the stuff the nice lady is explaining to me has to do with that, and regrettably it&rsquo;s all going over my head because I only have a VERY general idea of how XML works, so I figure I can stop by Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble after work and buy the best book based on reader reviews about XML, and at that very instant, the Team Leader for my group shows up on my desk. He comes with a nice smile, but I know better, because, shit, I&rsquo;m trouble. <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/g/e/getawayplz.gif"" /> I don't know what about, but I recognize that &quot;You fucked up <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/u/f/ufufuplz.png"" />&quot;&nbsp;look when I see it.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;You missed the meeting at noon,&rdquo; he says with his very thick Arabic accent.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&quot;Fuck,&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/m/imdisapointedplz.gif"" />&quot;&nbsp; I think. &quot;I sure did.&quot;&nbsp; You see, my beloved Almanac, that morning while I had been in the midst of my training, he had sent an email about a meeting at noon. I had even written it on a sticky note and stuck it to my monitor, because, seriously, who the fuck has a meeting at noon? I was guaranteed to forget it if I didn&rsquo;t write it down somewhere. Well&hellip; apparently I was too busy trying to find something to do, and being bored out of my mind that I forgot said meeting and had gone off to catch up with Miles not five minutes before the meeting was supposed to start, and no one knew where I had taken off to, so&hellip;. Yeah. You get the picture.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/m/i/miseryplz.gif"" /> So&hellip; I was honest with Mr. Arabic, and I told him it slipped my mind, and he was all, &ldquo;So what you been up to?&rdquo; And I tell him about the stupid server not responding, and how I just asked the nice lady to show me stuff, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to like that. So he tells me, &ldquo;Well, when that happens, you can ask so-and-so to give you something to do, or you can do this, this, and that.&rdquo; <br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t know about the &quot;doing this, this or that,&quot; but I did ask so-and-so if there was anything to do, and she said there wasn&rsquo;t, so I told her I&rsquo;d be with the nice lady and she was okay with it, so what the fuck, what gives?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is he chewing me out with that creepy nice smile?<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/m/immadplz.png"" /><br /><br />Then it clicks&hellip;. Fuck&hellip;. He&rsquo;s a control freak. Great&hellip; <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/t/h/thatsgreatplz.png"" />just the last thing I need&hellip; a micro-manager to watch my every step. My last Team Leader was so chill about everything, man, I think I&rsquo;m spoiled. This is bad. He doesn&rsquo;t want me to get involved with other parts of the project because he knows everyone needs help, but then, bitch&hellip; don&rsquo;t take it out on me that no one seems to have a clue what to do with me when the server&rsquo;s down. I&rsquo;m not going to just sit there and do nothing. This was exactly what I had asked the big wig when he assigned me to this new job&hellip; if is there anyone I need to answer to, tell me know &lsquo;cuz I know enough about corporate America, there being too many chiefs and not enough Indians, and stepping on people&rsquo;s toes&hellip; boy do I know&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/w/t/wtfusayplz.png"" /><span style="""">&nbsp; </span>And of course, he was all &ldquo;Oh, you answer to me or so-and-so.&rdquo; See that? No mention of Mr. Arabic, and Mr. Arabic, turns out, seems to be running the show. Lovely. So here I am, my silly little Almanac&hellip; stepping on Arabic toes, making a knot of chain of command, and as for so-and-so, who&rsquo;s supposed to give me shit to do, well, she doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a clue. Sigh&hellip; at least so-and-so is nice, and I&rsquo;ll cut her some slack &lsquo;cuz she just got back from vacation and her epic tan seems to be interfering with her getting back to work-mode. I don&rsquo;t blame her. Chances are I wouldn&rsquo;t be giving a damn about anything either if I had a tan that epic.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">I finally leave work.<br /><br /> FREEDOM!<span style="""">&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/n/oniskiplz.gif"" /><br /><br /></span>Drive home, have my typical turret&rsquo;s-like outburst of road rage, and head to Home Depot because, as you know, my dear Almanac, when I moved to this house, I had a bit of a problem with ants and, well, I killed them bitches. Yet, as of a couple of days ago, they came back, and with an Air Force to boot. That&rsquo;s right&hellip; flying ants, besides the already very<span style=""""> </span>annoying ground troops. So today, I decide I&rsquo;ve had just about enough of these bitches, and get some hardcore bug killer.&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/s/a/saiyanplz.gif"" /> The one I had was organic because I was afraid Prieto would get poisoned, but me and Prieto are just going to have to take our chances. The war was on. I would buy the strong shit and annihilate them all. <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/p/l/planningplz.gif"" />&nbsp; Prieto will just have to stay away from the area I&rsquo;d be bombing. When I&rsquo;m at Home Depot, the urge I had ignored at work to go pee really kicks in, and, seriously&hellip; curse women for having such a short urinary tract. That shit hurts like a muthafucka if you hold it too long! <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/w/t/wtfisthatplz.png"" /><span style="""">&nbsp; </span>So I pay for the my bug killer artillery and landmines and&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/r/u/runrunrunplz.gif"" /> to my car, deciding I&rsquo;d piss at home. Bathrooms in Home Depot were at the other end of the store, so I figured, might as well wait. I drive home, and when I&rsquo;m taking out the bug killer arsenal out of the car, and my workbag, I discover that my cell is missing. Great&hellip; WTF is Mr. Droid? Needless to say, I seem to have left it at Home Depot on the self-check-out register. <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/p/u/punch1plz.gif"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/p/u/punch2plz.gif"" /> lkjsfakjldfd &hellip;!!! I slammed Mr. Silver&rsquo;s door so hard, I&rsquo;m surprised the window didn&rsquo;t shatter. I also slam the front door of the house, and when I&rsquo;m squirming my way to the bathroom, my button decides to be a bitch, and believe me, it&rsquo;s a miracle I didn&rsquo;t rip my pants in two trying to take them off.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Then&hellip;. *insert biiiiiiig (albeit angry) sigh of relief* Yep. The joys of taking a leak. <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/d/e/desperateplz.gif"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">I finish with that business and go back to Home Depot. I find my phone (praise baby Jesus!) on the tiny podium of guy who overlooks the self-checkout registers. But the bitch is walking away, and, hell no! I am not waiting until he comes back from his smoking break, I&rsquo;ve had enough of a shitty day at work, and I feel bad about just snatching the phone from his little table because it&rsquo;s just sitting out there in the open <strike>It's not until later that I consider being recorded stealing my own phone by the security cameras.</strike> So I stop him, and he was all looking at me all <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/m/a/madlynotimpressedplz.png"" />, and I&rsquo;m all thinking, &ldquo;Bitch, you saw me when I paid not 15 mins ago. It&rsquo;s my damn phone, and you&rsquo;re just pissed you can&rsquo;t keep it because I have a password on it, and you&rsquo;d have to hack it to make it work! Lasdkjflskjdf&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/n/onionnouplz.gif"" />&rdquo; But then I tell him what register I used, what kidn of phone it is, yadda yadda yadda, and he finally gives it to me, but not without a &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a retard for leaving your phone behind&rdquo; look... or... <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/w/o/wormhappy40plz.gif"" />. I felt like giving him a&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/d/o/dothisthingplz.png"" /> look right back, but he DID keep my phone and gave it back, so I just smiled and said thank you. It was easy to smile, you know, &lsquo;cuz I was just glad I didn&rsquo;t have to exchange my phone. I had already exchanged my iPod, dammit! And even if exchanging my phone would be free &lsquo;cuz I haz insurance, it&rsquo;d still be a pain in the ass to have to go to the store to get a new one (sync my contacts list, etc.) when I&rsquo;m already having such a shitty day.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">When I finally get home, I&rsquo;m so damn out of it, I just crash and pass out for about two hours, but not without having a mini-bitch fest with <lj user=""eternalshiva""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/r/e/retardiloveitplz.png"" /> lol&hellip; she kinda bailed on me, but it was for a good cause, my husband (a story for a future entry&hellip; man, I have so many of those already) was having a very high fever <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/h/ohdearplz.png"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, in the midst of my nap, I get a text message, and a gazillion phone calls&hellip; being the pissy cunt that I&rsquo;ve been all day, I ignored them all, thinking, &ldquo;So much for getting my phone back llakdsjfklasdjfkladsjflkajdsf <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/d/e/destroyplz.gif"" /> &ldquo; Should&rsquo;ve turned that bitch off, but what&rsquo;s done is done. I took a shower afterwards&hellip; a very nice long shower, so here I am now. Yay! Glad the day&rsquo;s over, and drinking a tall glass of iced water.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So there ya go, Mr. Almanac. Is nice to spam you again&hellip; man, I missed doing this <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/g/r/grin--plz.png"" /></p>&nbsp;<br /> </lj-cut>"

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Dear Almanac,</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">It&rsquo;s been ages since I&rsquo;ve used your pages to express my very frivolous thoughts, but for a while now, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do so. Do not think that I&rsquo;ve abandoned you, or that I have callously deemed you merely useful for chapter announcements, for you know that is certainly not the case. The truth is that, for the longest time, I guess I didn&rsquo;t have anything worthy to inscribe in your endlessly loyal pages, but I suppose that today is a day as good as any to spam you with my thoughts&hellip; just like the good ol&rsquo; days, so&hellip; I hope you don&rsquo;t mind. <img alt="""" style=""width: 23px; height: 23px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/g/r/grin--plz.png"" /><br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Read more... You know you want to &gt;:-3""><p class=""MsoNormal"">On Saturday morning, May 21, 2011, I woke up to a craving for cake so uncontrollable, it was truly a miracle that I didn&rsquo;t just jump out of bed in my PJ&rsquo;s and head straight to the supermarket. Oh, wait&hellip; I don&rsquo;t wear PJ&rsquo;s&hellip; lol&hellip; can you imagine the looks I&rsquo;d gotten had I gone in what I usually wear to bed&hellip; or to be more precise, what I usually DON&rsquo;T wear to sleep? If you ask me, that&rsquo;s what you would REALLY call a sight for sore eyes!</p>        <p class=""MsoNormal"">After I made myself decent to be in public, I open the front door to step into one of the most gorgeous days I&rsquo;ve seen in ages! Seriously&hellip; it was my perfect kind of day&hellip; not too cold, not too hot, clear skies with just the right amount of cottony clouds, and a soft, occasional breeze that would bring a smile to your face even if you were having the shittiest of days&hellip; that sounds like quite the paradox considering the day was so nice, but I&rsquo;m not going to dwell on that too much <img alt="""" style=""width: 23px; height: 23px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/m/immastupidplz.png"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway! After I went and came from the supermarket and indulged in an embarrassingly large piece of cake&mdash;don&rsquo;t judge! <img alt="""" style=""width: 24px; height: 24px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/i/m/imhorrifiedplz.png"" />&mdash;I sat at my computer desk wondering what I&rsquo;d do on this wonderful day. &ldquo;Well, maybe I can watch those Netflix movies that arrived in the mail,&rdquo; I thought to myself, only to frown bitterly and sharply shake my head. There is no way in hell I&rsquo;d spend such a marvelous day locked up at home, with the shades down just so I can fry my brain cells staring at the &lsquo;Stupid Box.&rsquo; I mean, I know I&rsquo;m a hermit, but damn&hellip; had I done that, I think I even I might&rsquo;ve been embarrassed at the excessiveness.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So, there I sat&hellip; wondering what I&rsquo;d do. I thought of sitting on the deck (stop giggling! <img alt="""" style=""width: 24px; height: 24px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/w/t/wtfusayplz.png"" />) of my new home (a story for a future entry, I promise(!), there&rsquo;s much I need to tell you), but then it seemed that all of my neighbors had conspired against my desire to enjoy the day at home, and decided that today was the best day to take care of all those DIY projects they had put off because of the winter&hellip; or laziness&hellip; or whatever other excuse. To the left I had carpenters (loud saws, etc.), the front: the return of the deadly weed whacker, to the right: hammering, lawn mowing, and all kinds of banging noises&hellip; yes, my tractor neighbor (yet another story for a future entry) had seriously gone all out! So&hellip; to my misfortune, I could not enjoy this wonderful weather at home&hellip; at least not unless I was willing to put up with all the racket!</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So&hellip; &ldquo;What do I do?&rdquo; I asked myself. You see, I was really determined to break my hermit routine, and suddenly, the thought struck me. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; I had said out loud. Duuuuuuh.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Winchester!</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">I could go to Winchester! You see, my dear gullible Almanac, ever since I moved to Virginia in 2008, every time I drove around (got lost, to be more precise, but we&rsquo;re not going to get into that), I always saw signs everywhere that said &ldquo;X-amount-of miles to Winchester&rdquo; and I had always wondered about that city. I wondered if it was nice, or just your regular dump, and so on and so on. Still, I would go to Winchester whether it was a dump or the nicest place on earth. I needed to satiate my curiosity. Furthermore, I figured that, if the world was going to end (I know&hellip; pretty retarded, huh? But some people were apparently pretty serious about it), then I&rsquo;d spend it doing something I&rsquo;d always wanted to do. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>But then I asked myself, &ldquo;WTF am I going to do in Winchester? Am I really going to go over there and just drive around so I get to know the town I&rsquo;ve been meaning to go to for over three years?&rdquo; Once again, I found myself rolling my eyes and shaking my head. Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t go just to &ldquo;drive around&rdquo;&hellip; why spend an hour getting to Winchester to just do MORE driving? So I get on the intranetz and I go to the city of Winchester&rsquo;s main website to see &ldquo;What is there to do in Winchester?&rdquo; I looked at the list of attractions and it didn&rsquo;t take long before I decided on going to a Civil War museum. I know&hellip; how anti-climatic. You thought I was going to do something super, incredibly awesome, didn&rsquo;t you? Haaaaah&hellip; You should know better by now, tche! <img alt="""" style=""width: 26px; height: 26px;"" src=""https://sites.google.com/site/theorangescrub/_/rsrc/1301763271648/home/chapter1/isawitplz.jpeg"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Anyway, on my way to Winchester, I call my mum&mdash;just to harass her, ya know&hellip; see how she&rsquo;s doing, and all that jazz&mdash;and being the nosy parent that she is (wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way, to be honest ^_^), she asked what I was up to. So I tell her about my epic adventure to Winchester. I really did try to make it sound all intriguing and bad-ass, but you know the only thing that came out of her mouth?</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a long-ass drive by yourself to some city in the middle of nowhere? <img alt="""" style=""width: 28px; height: 28px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/a/m/amgplz.png"" />&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Jeez, mum&hellip; thanks&hellip; your enthusiasm really thrills me if you must know. If I hadn&rsquo;t been driving AND on the phone (hands-free, I promise!), I would&rsquo;ve face-palmed, but&hellip; parents&hellip; *sigh* what can you do?</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Yes, mum&hellip; alone. You know all my friends are either too lazy, married, live in Boonie-land, or probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to go to some boring Civil War museum in the middle of nowhere with me on the day the world&rsquo;s supposed to end.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal""><img alt="""" style=""width: 38px; height: 38px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/o/n/onionwoeplz.gif"" />&nbsp;Seriously, mum, did I already tell you how encouraging I find your enthusiasm? Of course, I didn&rsquo;t tell her that, and to her credit, she tried redeeming herself by being glad that, all things considered (*cough*she hates the fact I&rsquo;m such a hermit*cough*), I was going out to enjoy the day, and that, if the world REALLY was going to end, I was going out on a bang.&nbsp;<img alt="""" style=""width: 33px; height: 33px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/d/o/dontunderstandplz.gif"" /> Ah, me mum&hellip; always so honest.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the conversation moved along onto other frivolities until my sister calls (in the middle of the conversation, because my family wouldn&rsquo;t be my family if they had perfect timing). My mum tells me to take the call, that she was doing God-knows-what (I can&rsquo;t remember), that she needed to get off the phone, anyway, and so I take my sister&rsquo;s call. Having already had a practice run of telling &ldquo;Perpetual&rsquo;s Epic Adventures to Winchester,&rdquo; to my mum, I tell my sister about the beautiful weather, and how I didn&rsquo;t wanna stay cooped up at home, yadda yadda yadda, and apparently my sister had me on speaker phone, and her nosy-ass husband was listening in as well (that&rsquo;s right, his nosiness is not one I particularly appreciate, but whatever), and you know what&rsquo;s the first thing I hear? That&rsquo;s right, my Dear Almanac&hellip; his big, loud-ass mouth saying &ldquo;AND SHE&rsquo;S GOING ALL THE WAY OUT THERE ALONE <img alt="""" style=""width: 36px; height: 36px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/h/o/honoesplz.png"" />?&rdquo;</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">My expression: <img alt="""" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/g/u/guaahplz.gif"" /><br /><br />Thankfully, my sister is used to my random &ldquo;trips&rdquo; so she explained that the trip was only an hour away, and that I do this kind of thing all the time, etc. (Uh, I used to when I lived in Texas with her, but whatever.)</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">So&hellip; on to Winchester! The town, to my delight, was quite beautiful&mdash;but then again, I&rsquo;ve always had a bias for the &ldquo;small town&rdquo; feel, soooo&hellip; yeh&mdash;and Old Town Winchester was even more charming. I make it to a parking lot that&rsquo;s apparently near the museum, so I decide to use my Droid X to navigate the rest of the way to the museum by foot. Needless to say Mr. Droid couldn&rsquo;t decide which way was north, let alone south&mdash;apparently I was standing in the middle of a massive magnetic field&mdash;, so I decided to forgo Mr. Droid&rsquo;s tardy land navigation abilities and luckily, I find the place.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""""><img src=""http://www.visitvicksburg.com/!userfiles/buslist/OZdVvMYX.jpg?crop=auto&amp;maxWidth=323"" alt="""" /><br /></span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><strike>steal picture from the intranetz no jutsu!<br /></strike></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">When I go inside, I discover that the museum is a lot smaller than how it looks from the outside, but this doesn&rsquo;t faze me.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">For your viewing pleasure, my dearest Almanac, I took some very shitty pictures (at least Mr. Droid didn&rsquo;t fuck that up as bad), so I hope you enjoy them. <img alt="""" style=""width: 25px; height: 25px;"" src=""http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/c/l/climaxplz.gif"" /></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">Standing before the main entrance of the museum, you are meet with this wall:</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/perpetual159/pic/0001chsc/""><img width=""640"" height=""360"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/perpetual159/pic/0001chsc/s640x480"" alt="""" /></a><br /></span></p>    <p class=""MsoNormal"">LMFAOOOO!

Consequently, I&nbsp;have lost a great deal of interest in all things pertaining to <em>Naruto</em>.</li><br /><li>Real life has me very distracted these days, which severely hinders my ability to complete chapters. There are days when this is not so much of a problem and I am able to write great deal, but never enough to finish one chapter. Then, whenever I&nbsp;get some free time, and the opportunity to write once again presents itself, my heart just isn't in it, or I can't focus, or it's just one thing or the other.</li><br /><li>As far as the website is concerned, it will NOT be shut down. I'll still keep it up, but I&nbsp;just don't have the desire to read fanfictions these days. Seeping through all the garbage just to find that one good story is one painstaking process, and I simply don't have the drive to do it anymore. Consequently, there will not be anymore monthly (or bi-monthly) updates. If I happen to find that one good story, I'll make an announcement in the community and add it to the collection, but chances are that these announcements will be sporadic at best. (I am still willing to receive recommendations, however.)<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Edit (28 March 2011 21:36 EST):</strong> You may also feel free to submit stories to the website's challenges. As always, I will do my best to upload and announce them on the website ASAP.</li></ul><br /></li><li>&nbsp;<lj user=""_midoriko_sama_"" />&nbsp;'s <em>Icha Icha Physics</em> will continue to be posted and announced on the website as normal. Despite my disinterest in Naruto, her story is downright one of the best NaruHina stories I've ever read, and, long story short, I&nbsp;really do want to find out what happens next. That, and I'm sure if I&nbsp;don't continue to post it on the website, a lot of people would surely have my head. ~_~</li></ul>So that's that. My hope is that I don't give up on my stories entirely. Right now, where I&nbsp;stand, I&nbsp;feel that I have not entirely given up on them, but to be honest, I don't know what the future holds. <br /><br />That being said, I'd like to take the opportunity and apologize to everyone, but especially to my closest friends: <lj user=""eternalshiva"" />&nbsp;, <lj user=""tempestamorte"" />&nbsp;, <lj user=""_midoriko_sama_"" />&nbsp;, <em>Time Shifter</em>, and <em>Jolly Green.</em> I know this is terrible news, and I&nbsp;know you all really tried your best to deter me from making such a drastic decision, and although I know that this will disappoint you greatly (not <em>only</em> because of all the time and effort you invested in helping me make my stories great), I feel that I was disappointing you even more by making you wait for something not even I&nbsp;was sure when I'd complete.&nbsp;<font color=""#000099""><font face=""trebuchet ms,sans-serif""> </font></font>I&nbsp;cannot force myself to write knowing that the end product will be absolute mediocrity at its best, since I've always been an &quot;all or nothing&quot;&nbsp;kind of person, and if I can't deliver what I deem is the best of me, then there is no point in me continuing.&nbsp;<br /><br /> I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;have failed you all&nbsp;and I'm truly sorry. :(<br /><br />Sincerely, <br /><br />Perpetual159"

Yep. That's not surprising. I never fail to get into an writing funk of epic proportions during the winter.</li><br /><li>I'm not really excited about (canon) Naruto these days.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know there's not much Kishi can do, considering that the boring dialog and jutsu explanations are necessary for things to make sense, but that doesn't stop it from, well, being dreadfully boring.

"event","Hmmm... So a while back I&nbsp;was tagged by <lj user=""shawnyw""/>&nbsp;to complete this meme.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think right now, while I'm at work shamming (it's not really shamming when there's nothing to do, hmph!), I&nbsp;am finally bored enough to do this meme.&nbsp; Those that know me well know that that I'm not all that crazy about memes, but hey, I think since today is going by so freaking slow, I&nbsp;might as well kill some time.&nbsp; Yes, I&nbsp;am officially <em>that </em>bored. This doesn't happen often D:<strong><br /><br />1. Which is your favorite fic?</strong><br /><br /><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/clones""><em>Clones</em></a>!<br /><br /><strong>2. Which is your best-received fic?</strong><br /><br /><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/clones""><em>Clones</em></a>!<br /><br /><strong>3. Which is your worst-received fic?</strong><br /><br />Hmmm... so far my stories haven't been received negatively, but if anything, <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/loving-you""><em>Loving You</em></a> is my least popular story. Too emo for some people's tastes.<br /><br /><strong>4. Which is your angsty-est fic?</strong><br /><br />Uh... ~_~'' That would be <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/loving-you""><em>Loving You</em></a> ... again. <br /><br /><strong>5. Which is your funniest fic?</strong><br /><br /><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/clones""><em>Clones</em></a>! At least I&nbsp;think, ^_^''<br /><br /><strong>6. Smuttiest?</strong><br /><br />Heeeeh... well, although I've promised plenty of smut so far, I&nbsp;think <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/-til-next-time""><em>'Til Next Time</em></a> (despite <em>Clones&nbsp;</em>having more pr0nz--eventually!) is my dirtiest work to date.&nbsp; It's not complete yet, but so far it's pretty darn filthy (what I've written for chapter, two, that is)! O_O <strike>Well, at least it's pretty dirty by my standards D:</strike><br /><br /><strong>7. Fluffiest?</strong><br /><br /><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/clones""><em>Clones</em></a>!&nbsp; Chapter five is sappy enough to rot yer teeth and give you diabetes.<br /><br /><strong>8. Have you ever made someone cry with a fic?</strong><br /><br />Word is that <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/clones""><em>Clones</em></a> has made people cry because (particularly chapter five) it's so bloody romantic.&nbsp; At least that's what some reviewers have claimed. ^_^&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;also had Miles (a friend of mine IRL)&nbsp;read <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/loving-you""><em>Loving You</em></a> and she was at the verge of tears 'cause she thought I&nbsp;had gone through what Hinata was going through in the first chapter. Haaaaah, actually I've never personally gone through that, but hey, if she believed I&nbsp;had, that must mean I conveyed the anguish and emoness as intended. &gt;:-3 <br /><br /><strong>9. Which fic frustrates you the most?</strong><br /><br /><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/clones""><em>Clones</em></a>! Holy fuck, I&nbsp;love it to death, but it's kicked my ass sooooooo many times. The fact I re-wrote it should tell you enough.<br /><br /><strong>10. Which fic was the most fun to write?</strong><br /><br />Of all the writing I've done so far, <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/halfway-there""><em>Halfway There</em></a> has actually been the easiest and funnest.&nbsp; That's not to say I didn't hit one or two road-blocks here or there, but for the most part, I breezed right through that one.<br /><br /><strong>11. Who is your favorite OC you've ever created?</strong><br /><br />One of my rules in writing fanfiction is that I&nbsp;don't do OC's, so... yeah. I&nbsp;mean, Naruto has enough characters to last a lifetime, so... yeh.<br /><br /><strong>12. Are you better at oneshot or mulitpart?</strong><br /><br />Multi-parts. I have yet to write a one-shot. <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/perpetual159/loving-you""><em>Loving You</em></a> was meant to be a one-shot, but... yeh... I&nbsp;just couldn't help but to elaborate on it.<br /><br /><strong>13. What character do you think you're the best at portraying?</strong><br /><br />Fu fu fu fu... Naruto. He's so much fun, so cocky, stubborn, strong, yet vulnerable, kind, clueless, optimistic.... Gaaaah... I&nbsp;can really relate to him, so he's really easy to write for me.<br /><br /><strong>14. What character is the most difficult to portray?</strong><br /><br />Hinata. I&nbsp;love her to death, but she's difficult to keep in character for me since she's so shy. I've tried other characters *cough*Neji*cough* but not enough to make an accurate assessment. I&nbsp;do know that he kicked my ass, too, though. <br /><br /><strong>15. Tag five other authors!</strong><br /><br />Ack! Nuuuu... I&nbsp;dun do tagging, and I don't know that many writers, anyway. And the ones I&nbsp;do know hardly set foot in LiveJournal, let alone do memes. They're snobs, I&nbsp;know."

"event","Hi, everyone! <br /><br />Hope all is well.&nbsp; I've been getting a lot of messages/reviews from people asking when I'll be updating, and the answer is soon!&nbsp; The re-write of Chapter V is finally complete and is undergoing the editing process. <br /><br />Depending on the betas (yes, all three of them), this could take a day, or it could take two weeks. There's really no way to tell.&nbsp; Real life, of course, takes precedence, so I let them do their work at their own pace.&nbsp; Please be patient, my dear readers. ^_^&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>eternalshiva</em> is pregnant -- she's actually due in less than two months! O_O --, <em>TimeShifter</em> is rather busy with work since he recently graduated from college, and although <em>Jolly Green</em> is fairly accessible, his life can get rather hectic from time to time, too.&nbsp; So, my beloved readers, it's only a matter of time. Besides, I&nbsp;am certain you will enjoy a well-written chapter much more than a choppy, crappy chapter. <br /><br />Thank you all very much for your support! It's greatly appreciated. ^_^<br /><br /><strong><em>P.S.&nbsp;</em></strong><em> I'm doing all I can to re-write the chapters in two week's time so that I can update the story roughly once a month, and so far it's been working.&nbsp; Summer and Fall I've noticed are my most creative seasons, so I'm milking it as much as I can while it lasts.&nbsp; I'm hoping I can finish this story before the year ends. &gt;:-3&nbsp; But we'll see.&nbsp; I won't make any promises, but that IS&nbsp;the plan.</em> *shrugs*"

"event","I had been so utterly thrilled that Hinata had finally confessed at first.&nbsp; I did the Ultimate NaruHina dance, I sang to my cat, <a href=""http://perpetual159.livejournal.com/529.html"">Prieto</a>, and I even posted on all the spastic NaruHina blogs about how excited I had been with this new, amazing development. But then, I had to ask myself&hellip; <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Is Hinata really dead...?"">Is Hyuuga Hinata really dead?<br /><br />I seemed to have forgotten that possibility, as I had been too busy in my NaruHina victory.<br /><br />There are really so many things to consider when answering this question, and the ambiguity of how this supposed death was portrayed is not the only thing to take into consideration.&nbsp; At first, many of us NaruHina shippers were ecstatic to see Hinata FINALLY grow a pair and confess her love for our ever-clueless hero.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was exhilarating to see the determination in her face, the way she stood firm between the love of her life and the evil that threatened said love.&nbsp; <br /><br />Her lacking stutter simply awed me, for I had always assumed she would become a nervous wreck when professing her love for him, and I don&rsquo;t think I was the only one.&nbsp; <br /><br />But then, as someone who does some heavy fiction reading on a daily basis, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m the only one who seems to think that a lot of the things that have been happening in this manga aren&rsquo;t exactly adding up the way one would assume.&nbsp; <br /><br />Masashi Kishimoto, in my humble opinion, seems to be jumping around his own plot too much for my liking, and while sometimes he seems to stall forever to get anywhere, there are times he just throws one surprise after the other with no real excuse or preceding reason, and then all of a sudden we&rsquo;re dealing with a brand new problem while the there are many other problems that have yet to be resolved.<br /><br />What is more upsetting than anything is that while he presents a whole array of themes in his story, as we reach one major climax and enter another arc, or perhaps near the end of this story, is to see how many loose ends are neglected and no one bothers to wonder what was the point all along if there was no reason for said themes to be explored.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure, like any writer, Kishimoto plays favorites, and this is obvious in the way his favorite characters get a lot more screen time as opposed to other supporting characters.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, I understand that supporting characters are created for a reason, and as such, that reason is to aid the main characters in reaching their goals and to perhaps validate the reasons certain things happen in the plot.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that writers are required to develop themes for these supporting characters, but the fact that many writers do so without hindering the story itself shows their mastery for story telling and many times adds depth to the story.&nbsp; However, creating themes for supporting cast is great and dandy AS LONG AS you plan on fulfilling those themes.&nbsp; But in the end, a supporting character&rsquo;s minimum requirement is that they have a personality which goal is to promote and encourage the main character(s) to fulfill their own goals and themes.&nbsp; <br /><br />In Kishimoto&rsquo;s case, what I don&rsquo;t appreciate about his writing is that he develops themes and problems for each of these supporting characters to deal with, and these characters never really seems to solve their problems or fulfill their themes.&nbsp; Only favorite characters fulfill their themes and are given the opportunity to show their progress and development.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Kishimoto's supporting characters tend to either &ldquo;conveniently&rdquo; die, or magically fall off the face of the earth for extended periods of time throughout the story.<br /><br />To me, it seems that while Kishimoto created these supporting characters, applying whatever themes to their roles seemed a good idea at the time, but now that the story is in motion, he seems too preoccupied with other things to really give a damn about the very themes he had applied to these supporting characters in the beginning.&nbsp; This kind of writing is amateurish.&nbsp; I'm not a writer by profession, but even I know that.<br /><br />And this brings me to my other point&hellip;<br /><br />I wonder what Hinata had been doing for two and a half years&hellip;<br /><br />This again relates to my argument of the current filler arc of the anime.&nbsp; Hinata displays a lot of great potential, and shows much of her strength only to get shot down by something inconceivably stupid.&nbsp; After watching this happen time and time again, it becomes rather disappointing when, initially, Kishimoto roused the interest and hopes of many fans only to then disillusion them.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sure, life isn&rsquo;t fair, and in real life, things don&rsquo;t happen just the way we want it to, but for a reason this is called fiction.&nbsp; We humans enjoy fiction because it is an escape from reality, and although we don&rsquo;t always get a happy ending in fiction itself, we at least expect a rewarding ending.&nbsp; We expect conflicts to be solved, unlike how some authors hope we as readers overlook these discrepancies.<br /><br />The actual point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that Kishimoto did not fulfilled Hinata Hyuuga&rsquo;s role if, indeed, she is dead.&nbsp; Hinata Hyuuga, for that matter, is not the only one.&nbsp; There is still Hatake Kakashi&mdash;whose assumed death is still a mystery&mdash;and Shizune, Tsunade&rsquo;s assistant. (How the hell did Shizune die, anyway?&nbsp; I&nbsp;remember reading the manga, and two seconds later, she's dead stiff and Shikamaru and company are examining her body for any clues in defeating Pain.&nbsp; I find it the depressing I&nbsp;don't even remember how Shizune died... I mean... that's how fleeting these deaths are becoming.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, it's Shizune, for God's sake!&nbsp; The Hokage's assistant and ever loyal servant!&nbsp; Her death wasn't even foreshadowed.&nbsp; She just upped and died.... lulz... was she really that expendable?)&nbsp; <br /><br />Kishimoto had started in the right direction when it came to killing a character at the beginning of this story.&nbsp; He did excellent with Zabuza and Haku.&nbsp; He laid enough foundation, which proved the reasons he provided for any character&rsquo;s death were valid.&nbsp; He had done this rather well up until Jiraiya and even Itachi&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; After, it seemed as if Kishimoto started killing off other characters simply because he could, not because he had a good reason to.&nbsp; Many of his fans are claiming that he is a genius for doing this, for the deaths of several of these characters give depth to, not only the story, but the main characters because the effect these deaths would have on the main characters, etc., and because we just need to wait for the end of the story to see what's really gonna happen.&nbsp; Well, my friends... I think that by the end of the story, so much shit would have happened, we're not even going to remember who died in the first place.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, who gives a damn about Zabuza anymore after he kicked the bucket.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know a lot of people are obsessed with Haku, but that's because he's the epitome of yaoi-fandom.&nbsp; <br /><br />But then, if all these deaths so far are supposedly so meaningful and pivotal, why does Naruto seem so unperturbed by at least half of these characters' deaths?&nbsp; Given the circumstances of those deaths, Naruto had all the right reasons to go &ldquo;Kyuubi,&rdquo; knowing he stood before the very man who killed his two senseis and had destroyed his village.&nbsp; Wasn't that enough reason to piss him off go &ldquo;Kyuubi&rdquo;?&nbsp; <br /><br />He also saw Pa frog die, too, and&hellip; yeah&hellip; he was mad, but he still didn&rsquo;t go didn&rsquo;t go nuts!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&rsquo;m sorry, but you destroy the place I call home, and kill three of the most influential figures in my life; you bet your ass I would&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;Kyuubi&rdquo;!<br /><br />You could argue that Naruto has grown up, and that he has a better handle on his emotions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, that is until a weird, dark and creepy Hyuuga comes along&hellip; <br /><br />Why did he suddenly loose it then?&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes&hellip; yes&hellip; she said she loved him.&nbsp; True, no one had ever said that to Naruto, but as of yet, we have to hear what his take on that whole confession is.&nbsp; Furthermore, do we really know exactly how much Hinata&rsquo;s words impacted him, considering they were said in the heat of battle, and that he really hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to sit down and analyze this new development?&nbsp; Well... I mean... we all know is NOT new, but it is for HIM.<br /><br />Anyway, some may argue that while having your friend, or even your teacher killed can be painful, it&rsquo;s a whole lot more tragic if someone who actually loves you, declares their love for you and proves it by sacrificing themselves is completely on a whole new level.&nbsp; <br /><br />But&hellip; still&hellip; *sigh* while a love confession may be epic for Naruto, it&rsquo;s from someone he rarely thought about.&nbsp; Sure, he kicked Neji&rsquo;s ass in the Chunin exams in Hinata&rsquo;s name, but as a general rule, Naruto is very gallant by nature, and would perhaps do that for anybody he sees is being treated unfairly.&nbsp; (Note that this is my logical side speaking, not my NaruHina side speaking, heh... because that&rsquo;s a whole different story.)&nbsp; <br /><br />I can certainly give Naruto the benefit of the doubt, considering just how unpredictable he is, and say that, indeed, he was deeply impacted by Hinata&rsquo;s love confession (my NaruHina side really hopes that&rsquo;s the case, anyway).&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure, it certainly is a possibility, but I truly think killing Hinata is sheer laziness on Kishimoto&rsquo;s part, and his way to stealthily and underhandedly get off the hook when it comes to fulfilling Hinata&rsquo;s theme.<br /><br />Furthermore, what&rsquo;s up with Kishimoto suddenly retrieving characters that rarely get any screen time just so they can drop like flies?<br /><br />By the looks of it, Hinata is apparently no exception to this little phenomenon. <br /><br />While in pre-time skip, we, as followers of the story, were always reminded that Hinata continued to work hard and strive to overcome her weaknesses.&nbsp; All of a sudden, in post-time skip, we hardly see her at all.&nbsp;<br /><br /> What happened?&nbsp; <br /><br />Where the hell did she go?&nbsp; <br /><br />For a while, I went along with it, because there were more important things happening in the story that certainly took precedence, and figured that perhaps Hinata&rsquo;s development could wait a bit longer.&nbsp; <br /><br />When the opportunity finally presents itself and Hinata is given screen time (think Sasuke retrieval arc) to show how much she has improved, she is literally less proactive than a bench warmer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean, you really begin to wonder&hellip; you get curious about that strange chick with the cataract-eyes and varicose veins on her temples. <br /><br />What was her role, again?&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; Become stronger!&nbsp; <br /><br />Duh&hellip; <br /><br />Oh, and as a bonus, she gets to admit to the main character that she loves him!<br /><br />Yes, yes&hellip; now I remember&hellip; <br /><br />All this time, she is presumed to be working hard at becoming stronger, and yet, we never see the fruits of her labor.&nbsp; And when she does try to show her strength, the author doesn&rsquo;t really give her a chance to shine because he decides to kill her simply for the sake of a &ldquo;wicked, kick-ass&rdquo; twist in the plot?&nbsp; <br /><br />Well&hellip; at least that seems to be the theory of many Kishimoto-groupies, anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seriously&hellip; what the fuck?<br /><br />People will argue that Hinata watched the entire fight between Naruto and Pain, therefore jumping in to protect the source of her strength and affections fulfills her role, and therefore completes her theme.&nbsp; <br /><br />But then again&hellip; why go through so much trouble if you&rsquo;re going to die in the end?&nbsp; <br /><br />Besides&hellip; Hinata wasn&rsquo;t the only one watching the fight!&nbsp; A lot of people could&rsquo;ve jumped in!<br /><br />Yes, Hinata does claim she has no regard for her life if it means she gets to protect Naruto, the one she loves, and while that is heartbreakingly romantic, and, dare I say, brave of her, it is a weak and disappointing move by the author of this story.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having Hinata profess her love seconds before her death is stupid and doesn&rsquo;t make her death any more meaningful than a fly being hit with bug spray.&nbsp; Hinata&rsquo;s death was rushed, prosaic, and poorly executed, no matter how much people claim it is to affect the future of the story.&nbsp; Quite frankly, to me it seems Kishimoto just didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with Hinata&rsquo;s character, because he had already dug a hole so deep, he seemed to have forgotten what had been the reason he was digging that hole in the first place.&nbsp; <br /><br />If Hinata&rsquo;s death does indeed become a reality, not only does it become clich&eacute; and predictable, but it also becomes boring, vapid and disappointing, despite how much her love confession excited me, which is something a lot of us had been waiting for more for more than 400 chapters. <br /><br />If Hinata was a minor character, why did Kishimoto wait over 400 chapters to show she had finally grown enough balls to tell Naruto she loved him?&nbsp; If she was such a minor character, why was she&mdash;and not another main character&mdash;the one chosen to play the role out of the rookie nine and Team Gai&rsquo;s generation to not only see Naruto&rsquo;s potential from the very beginning and that he truly was (a good person), but the one who was ALWAYS in love with him?<br /><br />Was Hinata&rsquo;s death really meant to be the final straw on pushing Naruto over the edge and become everything he has been fighting NOT to become and loose control of the one thing that would lead to his demise&mdash;and everyone else&rsquo;s for that matter?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />If Hinata&rsquo;s were such a minor character, why would her supposed death be the cause of such a pivotal point in the story?&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean, Hinata&rsquo;s death seems to be leading Naruto into the one thing he has refused to do his whole life: giving up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, I personally see&mdash;no matter how intriguing it might&rsquo;ve seen at the time I saw it the first time&mdash;Naruto&rsquo;s surrender to the Kyuubi&rsquo;s power as a sign of weakness and giving up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hinata&rsquo;s death would change Naruto into being the person he always avoided becoming: a dark, depressed, and hurt man.&nbsp; This would in turn destroy the moral of this story.&nbsp; <br /><br />This story&rsquo;s main theme is that despite all the hardships, and all the misfortunes one can ever encounter in life, one must stay strong and positive, and fulfill one&rsquo;s dreams. <br /><br />I can&rsquo;t see that happening with a guilt-ridden and vengeful Naruto.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&rsquo;t see that happening with a Naruto who fails to ever smile again.&nbsp; <br /><br />That would be as bad as seeing a sensitive, kind, friendly, and happy-go-lucky Sasuke who smiles at any given opportunity, and never really had a problem with his whole clan being massacred. <br /><br />Sure, I was thrilled to see Hinata Hyuuga&mdash;the least expected&mdash;be the one out of everyone who was still alive in Konoha be brave enough to confront Pain while Naruto was in such a precarious situation.&nbsp; She knew she didn&rsquo;t stand a chance, but she still jumped in, as opposed to everyone else who pretty much kicked back with a bowl of popcorn and enjoyed the show as if it they were in a gladiator coliseum. <br /><br />Yes, Pain is a mean bastard, and thus far he has not hesitated in not just hurting, but killing people, and destroying an entire village.&nbsp; At this very moment, I doubt that despite Hinata&rsquo;s love confession he would develop a shred of humanity and spare her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nevertheless, the fact that her death was not openly shown as with the other deaths gives me that one tiny shred of hope she might still survive.&nbsp; But I have to say that shred is VERY small.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will always think that killing Hinata is too much, even for Kishimoto. Regardless that killing the shy girl who felt unrequited love for the main character is the standard and tradition for Shonen stories, he went a bit too far.&nbsp; Sure, in terms of the story, I guess some would call it ingenious.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s old and clich&eacute;&hellip; and old and clich&eacute; is not what Kishimoto is known for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, it&rsquo;s clich&eacute; that the only girl who always believed in the hero from the very beginning puts her life on the line for him while confessing how much she loves him and our clueless hero is in a position that allows him to do ABSOLUTELY nothing about it, except resort to the one thing he has been training himself NOT to do.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is Kishimoto&rsquo;s purpose with this whole set up, really?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Is killing the weird and dark girl supposed to really scar Naruto for life, and make him perceive life through a different light?&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t Jiraiya or the destruction of the village cause such a deep reaction?&nbsp; I always thought those two things were something Naruto always held VERY close to his heart.&nbsp; <br /><br />But Hinata?&nbsp; The girl he barely noticed?&nbsp; Just because she claimed she loved him?<br /><br />Jeez&hellip; I&rsquo;m beginning to think that Kishimoto has been reading one-too many poorly written, clich&eacute; fanfics! Ha!&nbsp; How ironic!<br /><br />I mean&hellip; umm&hellip; where HAVEN&rsquo;T we seen this happen already?<br /><br />No, I&rsquo;m not undervaluing Hinata, but I am trying to prove a point here based on what I&rsquo;ve learned about Naruto after reading over 400 chapters!<br /><br />In the end, I think chapter 437 was the worst and best chapter I&rsquo;ve ever read, but it is slowly and surely tipping on the worse side of the scale the more I think about it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hinata was&mdash;despite this being an action/adventure story&mdash;the only genuine shred of romance in this entire story, and we all know that, no matter how much NaruSaku fans try denying it.&nbsp; And if we&rsquo;re going to be sticking to tradition, the main character HAS to fall in love, and it would only be fair that he falls in love with the girl that truly deserves his affections.<br /><br />At the rate this story is going, Naruto is slowly becoming the kind of person he had helped so many stopped from being, starting with Gaara. <br /><br />Hinata&rsquo;s assumed death, compared to Jiraiya&rsquo;s or Asuma&rsquo;s, accomplishes nothing in my opinion, especially if it was done as an excuse to reveal Naruto's sixth tail.&nbsp; It would even be MORE&nbsp;disappointing if Hinata's death was created in order to prevent depicting a scene that shows Naruto reflecting on her love confession if she were still alive. After all, this could possibly lead to him falling in love, not just crushing, as he has done with Sakura.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, just like in all those terribly written fanfics out there, I too believe that, considering how much Naruto has always craved for attention, he could very easily fall in love with Hinata who would be more than willing to give him all the attention in the world for an entire lifetime. <br /><br />Naruto&rsquo;s crush on Sakura is easy to deal with for Kishimoto because, let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s really not going anywhere considering Sakura is obsessed with Sasuke.&nbsp; And Sakura&rsquo;s feelings for Sasuke are just as easy to deal with because Sasuke is too obsessed with his past, therefore, there is no love story in Naruto, and I have a feeling that Kishimoto wants to keep it this way.&nbsp; I mean, hell, he even killed Asuma, knowing he and Kurenai were an item.&nbsp; Seriously, now... what gives? Is it really THAT hard for Kishimoto to write romance?  If it is, why put yourself in a situation that requires it?  Killing characters off to avoid writing romance is a pattern the people begin figuring out after a while, you know... <br /><br />After all, Hinata and Naruto&hellip; well, I&rsquo;ll be damned, Kishi&hellip; that MIGHT just work, which is precisely what you seem to work so hard at preventing!<br /><br />So what do you do AGAIN, Kishi-darling?<br /><br />You say, &ldquo;Oh, damn it!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t write romance!&nbsp; I mean&hellip; Asuma and Kurenai just happened, but I never showed ANYTHING&hellip; but this&hellip; the fans are gonna WANNA see it!&nbsp; Fuck that!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m better off killing her!&rdquo;<br /><br />Tsk, tsk&hellip; Kishi-kun&hellip;<br /><br />That&rsquo;s a pretty lousy way to get off the hook&hellip;<br /><br />But why create a hook in the first place if you were never going to use it anyway?&nbsp; Or was that just your scheme to have Shojo fans watch your show, therefore making you richer?<br /><br />I'm not going to continue speculating down that path... it's kind of depressing, and sick... <br /><br />Anyway&hellip;. <br /><br />If killing key characters is Kishimoto&rsquo;s only way of meaningfully furthering his plot, then all he ever had from the beginning was a group of amazing characters, and no story to tell.&nbsp; If it turns out that Naruto is left alone at the end&mdash;I don&rsquo;t doubt it, especially at the rate Kishimoto is killing people&mdash;than Kishimoto played us all for fools and got rich in the process.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about the only thing that makes him a genius, so I&rsquo;ll give him that much credit.<br /><br />Some may argue that this story is far from over, but with all the people dropping like flies&hellip; um&hellip; I&rsquo;d say it kinda is&hellip;.<br /><br />And also&hellip;&nbsp; what is it with Kishimoto and emo bastards, anyway?&nbsp; We already had Emo Sasuke, but now we have to deal with Emo Pain?&nbsp; I mean&hellip; God damn, I had more fun watching pedophile Orochimaru!&nbsp; At least Oruchimaru had moves, and was fucking crazy and evil, but Pain is depressing, boring, and unoriginal.&nbsp; And watching him Shinra Tensei everyone to Timbuktu&mdash;because that&rsquo;s all he ever does&mdash;gets pretty old and boring after a while.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t he have more moves, or something, or is Kishimoto getting lazy again?<br /><br />Anyway&hellip; I am PRAYING Hinata doesn&rsquo;t die, so you can all rest easy.&nbsp; I am a NaruHina supporter to the very end, even after death!<br /><br />And, as a parting thought for the night: there is no story when the main character is left alone to wallow in his misery.&nbsp; People do that in real life every day.&nbsp; People don&rsquo;t want to invest their time in fiction that shows more of the same thing they have to deal with day in and day out&hellip; or well&hellip; at least some of us don't.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t personally have any misery that I need to wallow in, but I certainly don&rsquo;t want to wallow in someone else&rsquo;s misery&hellip; especially a fictional character&rsquo;s!<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://fc60.deviantart.com/fs45/f/2009/058/4/3/435431b60b1f3a48a487beb859c9cd15.jpg"" /><div style=""text-align: center;"">This drawing is not mine, but I thought it was hilarious.<br /><a href=""http://onewingedmuse.deviantart.com/art/Naruto-Savior-Comic-SP-114306132""><strong>deviantArt Link</strong></a></lj-cut>"

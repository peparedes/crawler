...fcuk. Maybe there is something wrong with me. I just.. this is not me. This isn't me. I don't understand how I could go from bright and happy and excited about thanksgiving to having... well... weird, really weird thoughts and mental-movies about killing someone.. or more like lots of people... and.. ugh. I know I've done some pretty bad things.. I know there was one point when I did.. something.. and it killed somebody and made a bunch of people catatonic.. put someone in a coma.. but I know I never did... this shit. I just.. this isn't me.. and I'm kind of scared.. because it's when I lose control that I end up doing things I regret.. and I don't want to be responsible for anything else.

....sigh. I just.. I don't know. I wish I could just snuggle with Richard and forget about it. I love him so much, it's not even funny. I wish I could explain.. I feel safe with him. I feel happy and content and whole with him. I just.. I want to make him as happy as he makes me. I hope he is. I love him a lot.. I would die for him. I would do practically anything for him. I would poke stupid ol' Elder Gods in the EYE if he (for whatever bizarre reason) needed me to do something like that. Although I probably would want to do that in the first place, stupid Elder Gods. Heheh. 

I hope Thanksgiving will be okay. I mean, I don't think Richard actually celebrates it, but I'm having him over and hopefully Doug. I was sitting with a pen and paper for like an hour before I realized that they're the only family I have in this dimension.. Japheth has been... away.. for like, forever. And my stupid foster parents hate me, and my stupid cultist parents are either in jail or dead, I guess. I don't really want to complain, though, because I'm really happy and I really love the ones I do have. 

...Oh! Speaking of pudding, I just remembered something. When you read <i>The Stand</i>, what is it that eventually defeats Randall Flagg? Is it intelligence? Strategy? God? NO! It's... <b><i>RETARDED MEN!</i></b>

"event","Yeah. Well, I've had my GED for a couple years now, and I want to sign up for some courses next semester at MU. I've been taking the odd class or two for credit. But I don't know if I'd be accepted even if I did apply to Miskatonic. And I don't know if I can do it.

And... it all comes down to the fact that there's nothing useful that I'm good at. I'm an artist and occasional writer, there is not much of a niche for that. I don't know if I could be a scientist of any kind, I can't stand math or the amount of study needed to do that. I'm too lazy and apathetic to be a lawyer. I'd want to be a therapist but I have more problems than I can list with any reasonable degree of certainty, and whenever I think of getting even a menial job, it all boils down to the fact that I'm scared of what I might do to the people around me. 

That leaves me with something like... janitor... which I will never do well, because I hate stuff that smells bad or weird. Cleaning stuff makes me sick to my stomach. 

I guess this was all brought on by the fact that, whatever it was that used to provide for me, doesn't anymore, and I'm going to be facing starvation by next weekend. Joy fun. Watch as I go try to remedy this.

...

Okay, that was me not doing it. I don't really care. I don't want to work too hard for a life that I don't want and don't have any guarantee for. I remember thinking that hope was maybe humanity's downfall and humanity's noblest feature. Now it just annoys me. There can't be hope for someone like me. Even if I accomplish my goal, I'll finish and there will be nothing. If I don't finish, I'll either be dead or in jail. I'm not going back there... I'd rather die than go back to jail.

I feel so weird lately. I sort of remember talking to Professor Miller about something, but it feels weird in my head to think about it. Like I shouldn't be. I don't know how to explain it.

I don't remember if I used to have heat, but I don't now. I'm so cold, it's not even funny. I'm wearing like two sweaters and I have every blanket I own on my bed. Well, that's just two. But still. I need to emphasise the all part. Heheh.

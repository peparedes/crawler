i can honestly say that i do appreciate this country for what i have and the opportunities it presents me, but i can also honestly say that i am not patriotic...pretty much at all. i find it hard to be patriotic and feel a part of something that is so messed up. this country is the butt of all jokes politically. it is embarrasing to be run by a group of people that have done nothing good for us...at all. not just that though...people are murdered every single day, people are robbed constantly, there is an everlasting flow of corruption in todays world, and in the places that we as young people are supposed to grow up and manage. i dont want to be a part of that...its the problem.

so when i think of patriotism, i think of a sports team. maybe because i was watching a 9-11 football sandwich commercial and i remembered what it feels like to be part of a close team and feel unified with them when you are on the field defending your school or playing for your pride. its definitely a great feeling, but a sports team is only minor scale. 

when 9-11 happened 5 years ago, how unified did you feel? were you feeling extremely patriotic? how patriotic are you now, how about before? this country needs to open their eyes that if we want to succeed as a human race, there can't be 1 out of who knows how many of us, trying to get ahead by somehow harming others. theres always a more greedy person, or one that just gets a kick out of killing...theres endless types now...some of the shit people come up with is just fucked up. unfathomable to most people...yet isn't that what brought on this patriotism? an unfathomable act that actually happened. it kicked everyone of us in the face and we got up and said Hooray America...well i say hooray me, and hooray you, and hooray the people i dont know. hooray for all of us that know what life is about and know that the only way this country and this world will ever change, is if we realize that peace lies within our own self exploration."

"event","""Never Forget""
The brain is full of thoughts.
To be opened by filling in the slots,
that you can unknowingly do 
by connecting all the dots.
Idea to sight.
To guide the flight
when you look, you shed some light
on what we call life.
The passing time.
An illusion of a measure,
chopped to pieces, by mind's knife.
Awake or asleep, we know not
where we are?
who we meet?
Just a world,
for our unexpecting souls to keep.
To ourselves the experience
of unknown waters to cross.
Over bridges,
that will never get us lost.
If we go with the flow
when we fall in,
to the rapids as they rage.
Helps us clear our minds,
clear our eyes and break.
Out of this cage,
out to see the sights.
Where the sky is blue,
but can also be purple.
Just another fork,
to choose which path,
leads life to come full circle.
Don't think.
Don't act.
Don't walk.
Just live.
A season's aquaintance.
New familiar faces
float by with a cloud.
Tell one, tell all.
Stand up tall,
wak down the road, and,
Never,
forget to be loud."

"event","i believe that every person has a destiny chosen for them, however i believe that they have more than just one. every person has several predetermined destinies, and they are narrowed down and eliminated as each person controls their own fate...

...fate is the multiple choices that everyone faces on a day to day basis.  they can be very simple decisions, such as what to eat, or when to go to the bathroom. they can also be very important decisions such as, choosing a career path, or choosing a college. all of the choices are still one in the same in the broader spectrum...

...ultimately, the decisions made everyday are the fate in which the individual controls to reach one of their predetermined destinies...in all, individuals choose their destiny by controlling their fate.

perhaps it is easier to visualize this theory...

picture yourself at the beginning of a road or a path in the woods (whichever makes you more comfortable) and then start walking down it. all of a sudden you come to a fork in the road and must choose which way to go. these forks are your choices, your fate that you will control and decide which way to walk. you have complete confidence in yourself because you know that you can't go any further without making a concious decision. on the other hand, you have no idea what lays ahead on each path. it is a destination that you will reach only when you die, but the fact that you don't know where each path brings you simply means that you have no control and that the path was already set for you...

..a predetermined destiny."

the difference now is that home is where everything has changed the most...i've been pretty fortunate to see an entire family grow up together and progress and mold each other into who we really are....looking back at 21 plus years is pretty cool.  and for every single memory i have of the years growing up, there is a tree of some sort in the memory...which leads me to believe that i am a tree hugger the way i am because of these memories which were actually real events that i had been through.....thats fuckin cool

way up high on a rock over the city, 
where the sky is reachable, 
and the stars are plenty.

the horizon's edge drew the line,
to spin so slowly,
and to tell the time.

captain clouds that float to catch,
a wave of memories,
that seem to flash.

old thoughts revealed and questions asked,
the truth comes out,
as it happened in the past.

a shooting star a warm felt breeze,
to start the end,

holding freedom at last,

A self proclaimed prophecy
We speak in toungues
Hours of the freshest air, intoxicating our lungs.
Gloomy nights pass us by
In wisps of smoke
Floating away in the midnight sky.
Words exchange unfiltered
Each profound thought put up on a pedistal
The door is open, waiting to be heard.
Miles cut to feet
Yet the path is cold, the lighting weak.
Hazy uncertainty grows clear
Green leaves, green trees, windy heights
Calling out for us to hear.
A deafening environment casts shadows along the rivers edge
Blinding spirits geometrically stopping a successful fall.
A shameful tragedy of sleeping time
Apparent loss on effort unseen
An ocean unexplored with a net of due time,
Drowning slowly,
Such an unfortunate crime."

in the absence of light surrounded by a big blanket of darkness...i had no worries mate. out of the darkness appeared some familiar light. it was just strong enough to light the road in front of me. safely guided through the night that i was so destined to encounter...i wound up where i began. it was just what i expected it to be.

all except for the fact that i never looked up at the stars that i star-ed on the map..."

"event","everything in life goes full circle...one thing leads to another, and eventually they lead back to the beginning making it a large loop. a sequence of events that may seemingly have no connection to one another until that very circle is complete. 

a recent life changing decision was made...without much thought to be quite honest. i don't know why it was made, and sometimes i find myself asking that very question...why? but then i take a step back, ponder, and find security in the fact that i am choosing my destiny as i allow fate to happen to me. that is to say, that the decisions and choices i make are all part of what is ""supposed"" to happen to me, but on the other hand, i control what happens to me by making these decisions, which leads me to this......(absolutely and completely not what i had set out to write about but maybe i'll get there)....

i believe, now, that each person has several fates lined up. each fate that an individual gets to is simply based on the choices that are made previously....probably the easiest way to compare it to anything would be those old books where you would read a page or two and then you would be given options to decide how you want the book to go....the options told you to jump to another page until you get to another set of options and the cycle repeats...it goes full circle, if you will. (those books were actually pretty incredible now that i think about how much creativity must have gone into the making of that kind of book.) i could go on explaining this, however if its not understandable from the book comparison, then its not going to be at all.

so as i sit here in a new place, with new people, with a new job, and a new frame of mind...i often reflect on my individuality and who i am. i tore myself completely away from everything i know and love, and threw myself into everything i despised and had no idea about. so far, its been not so bad. i think that it may have happened too early, but i also believe that i made this decision so that i could teach myself some lessons. 

and i have...

no longer do i look up to a simply older version of myself...instead i look to myself for guidance towards my own future. i am alone. more alone than i have ever been. it feels good. it feels damn good to say that...but i am lonely. its a simple fact, and i am lonely because i am lazy. very little effort mixed with an extraordinarily high level of awkward is definitely not potion number 9. it is those exact characteristics that make me who i am and define why and what happens to me. so really, when i think about it, the awkwardness comes only from those who perceive it that way.

thats just me...its how i work, and how i am. i can be nothing else no matter how much i have said it or have been told to do so...i really am not capable, and i'm ok with that. it will all come full circle and i am nothing short of excited to see what page i'm gonna jump to next."

"event","is it possible that things in this country were as bad as they are now way back when? did we just start our country off on the wrong foot or was there a point in time where things seemed to be ok? where people did not murder, where stealing wasnt just wrong to some, where greed did not exist? i would like to think that there was a time when all of this was spread across the land in a positive light. where death was only caused naturally. where sharing was literally what everyone learned in kindegarten and stuck with them throughout their lives. did they even have kindegarten back then? probably not. 

i sat reading over a play today. one that didnt make sense even a little. but within the play lay a poem written by the author of the play. a little out of the ordinary to just throw it into the middle of dialogue, but it was the only part that i enjoyed and even understood. it really hit home. i got to write about it in a paper that i will be passing in, and i also got to relate it to music. the paper i wrote had nothing to do with the assignment, but i am fairly confident that i will pass it in and recieve a passing grade for the assignment.  what i took from the poem as well as the assignment was that my way of thinking is not necessarily solitary. there are other people in this world who share my views. one whom i know for sure, who is from alaska (to borrow the phrase), and the others well...i dont really know them but i know that they see things the same way i do.

the author of this play...not a good writer. not really at all. the play really didnt make any sense and was a rip off of Shakespeare...another writer i do not particularly care for but have the utmost respect. an entirely new story i will dive into at a later date...but i couldnt help but appreciate exactly what he was writing.  ""Television The daily nausea Nausea"" -the first line of the poem. my sentiments exactly. everyday i sit down in front of the TV i get pissed off at what is being shown. whether it is the program i am watching because i am too lazy to change the channel or better yet just turn it off, or if its a commercial that has nothing to do with a product that they are advertising. something completely innapropriate filling the minds of young people with nonsense that they will turn into their own reality. its sad.

i have always, for as long as i can remember, forced my father to order cable. i thought that it was just something i couldn't live without. i found myself sitting with him watching the sopranos, a show i do not enjoy even the slightest, but one of the very few programs he enjoys. i spent the quality time with him to come to the realization that what he has been saying all along has been exactly what i have been thinking now...on my own...finally. i understand his point so i told him ""pops, get rid of cable. its nonsense"" he replied ""i've been thinking about it."" he wont do it of course, because them we would no longer have soccer to share, or the red sox to enjoy with my mother and grandparents.  he would not longer have his one guilty pleasure.  we would be less people without our cable. sad really, however not so much true. i believe we could do it. no...i know we could do it. just a matter of telling ourselves that we can figure other things out without the television at our disposal. 

why is my father always right? ahndahgs pops, ahndahgs. i love you. 

that is all...i think thats what i needed to realize. good night"

problems and remedies...

most people have pain in their life in some way shape and form. dealing with it can sometimes be easy and sometimes hard.  sometimes people look for an easy way out...a way to forget. in my opinion, there are only two really affective remedies:

1. talking: allowing someone else to share in your emotions is quite possibly one of the hardest mountains a person has to climb in their life. nobody really wants to say exactly how they feel, but on that once-in-a-blue-moon time when it happens, it frees you from your own burden.

2. writing: some people don't like to do the whole talking thing, so by writing down how you feel or what you are thinking, you are given an escape. you can let go of reality for a few minutes and just share yourself with yourself. noone else has to know whats going on, but at least its out there.

theres no need for any of that other nonsense...drinking, smoking, and popping pills to wash away these problems are only a way to make things worse. first alcohol is a depressant...it depresses people, even more so when they are already upset about something.  it is a lame way to say ""fuck it, ill be fine"" because you wont be fine...when you sober up, the problem is still there, but now its worse because of the alcohol. getting high is a quick fix...get high, be happy right? no, wrong...theres a good chance that the problem will be forgotten for an hour or so, but what about when you come down? what then? i'll tell you what...you don't know what to do because you weren't thinking about it. you immediately say...""that was good for me"" and then start smoking more and more, until finally you realize that time is wasted away and never to be regained. OR, being high allows emotions to be enhanced, and even though seratonin (the happy chemical in the brain) runs rampit...so does the paranoia. one thing leads to the next, and before you know it, you have built yourself an elaborate mess of unprobable possibilities that only you believe will ever happen...even though it is ridiculous to everyone around you.

none of this helps in any way...maybe this is something i needed to realize...perhaps not for personal reasons...but just because."

there are so many ways to look at and depict morals. on a personal level, a group level, a religious level, a family level....the list goes on. which morals are right however? are there any right morals, or are they true to one's self and only one's self...that whatever one person values is exactly right to themselves, but is the exact opposite of another individual?  i dont think this world has begun to understand how diverse morals are and that with such a wide range, there are bound to be problems.  

what if we had a morally unified world? would people stop murdering? would people stop stealing? i would hazard a guess and say yes...if everyone on earth had the same standard of morals, morals that were peaceful and tranquil, then yes, there would be no murdering, or stealing, and world peace would be as victorious as the 2004 Red Sox.

this is not possible...

why you ask? the very simple fact that has already been mentioned...my values are different from your values and different from her values and different than his values. its a neverending cycle of standards, that could bring peace upon tribes, schools, cities, countries, andeventually the world. but instead we human have some extreme variety of chemistry that allows us to think very differently from one another. 

i cannot find it in my heart to steal from another person. i feel disgusted with the thought, however that is just my belief, my value, and my moral as a young person. i have figured out that just because i think this is right, does not necesarily mean it is right. an individual going through life stealing money, food, clothes...anything at all...may possibly see it as a way to stand up to the system. it is right in their minds because they are overiding the ridiculous sums of money that are requested for tiny pieces of cloth, or that they can only get a job where they are paid minimum wage....which is set by the government. federal-$5.75...are you kidding me? its a message from people who steal to say ""we shouldn't have to kill ourselves working, not having a life, just so we can live and get by day to day."" Stand Up. its right for you, who am i, or anyone else for that matter, to say you are wrong?

with that said...

how does one live up to their own morals? by being perfect in everyway imaginable? no...thats not a possibility. by hurting others? sure. by hurting themself? indeed. but its something that everyone must do. it is a part of everyday life. each day an individual is faced with many choices. they base their choices on their standard of morals. they choose the one that fits in the best, and that will further increase the opportunity to live up to their values. some days are simple and less consequential...others are gutwrenching...but even so, the decisions one makes are a reflex of the brain which is enscribed with a fingerprint of commandments.

sometimes the reflexes are a little slow, shooting electrical fireworks through one's system. a wave of uncertainty crashes down.

but sometimes you wouldn't want it any other way."

"event","every now and then i forget what it is to really let go of an emotion. i was reminded that its so easily possible to let go of an emotion, but it can be done in any way you want. 

many nights here are spent walking the same path from mobility to stability. soothing sounds vibrate my drums, sparking a stream of consciousness that always seems to be flowing. it seems to be flowing, and most nights i dont know where im going, or why im going. all i know is that usually its alone...an unfulfilling solitude that i find myself questioning.

what is the point of a nightly? that is the question i ask myself upon each return. so far the only reason i can see for it, is to make me think...about life, love, day, night, hot, cold, and everything in between. every bridge i walk over leads me directly back to where i started...contemplating where i am in this walk.

simply put, i am a 21 year old college student with a ridiculous haircut, holding down a couple jobs, and mingling the best i can with the best i know.

in perspective, i am a 21 year old adult heading down the road in front of me.  but like so many days in the mountains, there is nothing but snow and fog surounding me. blinding me in every direction. with nothing but seeds that are looking for their soil: life, love, day, night, hot, cold. they, like me, are looking for something to hold onto. what they and i alike find to grasp, is nothing but a quick remedy. a quick fix if you will. and the only solidity i find is in the absolute best i know, who allow me to release any emotion the best way i know how. 

although sacred, my heart beats the release for everyone to hear. pouring out into what is now an unconscious stream of rhythm, emotion sounds, as the ""soul"" (as a good friend of mine once called it) pours out. when its all said and done, and not in the literal sense as is the point of this entry, what was released is now gone only to resurface once again when in dyer need of escape.

as the stars that guide my path back begin to fade, the bridge is left behind me. i stop and look back at what i just crossed. i see nothing but a canvas of snow and fog waiting to be painted. 

smiling now...the walk is over....i have arrived. and i have come to the realization that its all about the wordplay. i hold close what is sacred and know...no...hope. i hope that in time i will be able to let it go. but for now, simply put, i am a 21 year old number trying to do my part.

"event","what a night, what a day, what a week. its been crazy as of late. somehow we managed to put on a pretty decent show. from being ""the worst in 20 years"" to being what we are now is something i am proud of. so the stress is much lessened through the opening of the play. one more time and im done. for good. it was fun and worthwhile. thank you mrs. reilly. thank you jerry. but now its time to focus on what i love...music. the free time i have is now dedicated to music.

tonight was much less climactic than i had anticipated. started low but soared high as soon as i said those three last words ""oh my god"" as i fell dead on a park bench. came down to find myself opposite of where i just was, watching three of the most odd people i have ever met, 1 whom i know very well or care to know very well, and 1 gorgeous vixen. casted perfectly, every single one of them fit into their role perfectly. kudos and good show.

not particularly fond of the kind of greetings that were awaiting me, i quickly made my way out. i managed to escape almost without hinderance, being stopped only by one old man who was very complimentary, and only in stride by 3 girls whom i have never seen before, but was brought to my attention that one was in my class, and the other living in the suite next to me. interesting. is that my fault? perhaps. perhaps not. doesn't matter i suppose.

then as i dodged, i dipped when i shoulda ducked. an old car returning to take me for a spin. okay. not so bad i guess. what can it hurt. it rode a lot better than the last time i remembered, but still had trouble gettin' up some of the hills. i don't think that car will last too long. i've already let go of it i think. 

i listen to jeff buckley tell me not to be afraid of my own mortality if i've found true love. it was not ""cute"", it was fucking profound. listen, don't just hear. anyways, alone finally, talking to some eskimo, i spoke bluntly. sometimes thats what eskimo's need. they dont always understand normal language...you gotta talk so that they can understand. i think that eskimos probably expect people to talk differently to them....they're fucking eskimos!...but thats not the point and that should be obvious, and if its not, i just told you that it was."

"event","inspiration runs high when you find something worthwhile. i found in my case, inspiration comes from one thing. tonight, i realized why i am in school. i get it now. i know what i want to do for the rest of my life. school is helping me get there. its like the runway before the flight, and now i can't wait to pull up the landing gear and fly away. the inspiration for this was just realized tonight, and because of that i now know how the world goes round me now. tonight, i was given guidance. i have been searching for my path, but i was lookin for the wrong thing, i don't need a path, all i need is the open sky. 
                                                                     
the inspiration comes from within one's own self...i fear that true inspiration is what this world is lacking. jack, jeff, ben, dave, chris, bob, kristin, mr. lee, james, jason, mr. day, john, tp, lauren, mo, martin, ralph...the world needs to take notes. you all know the word, its time we spread it around and make this a better place to live. i'm tired of what we have. it needs to change.
                                    music                           
inventor of the ipod-you obviously know the word too. ""if you keep adding stones soon the water will be lost in the well"" thank you for reiterating what i was thinking.

so where does this inspiration stem from? 






whatever it is in your life that hits you in the face everyday and says ""be inspired"" it is as simple as that. when true inspiration enters your life, you will know. you will absolutely know.


I want to turn the whole thing upside
All finer things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and

thanks jack. keep doin what you're doin. it will work eventually, the world will understand."

"event","There are too many stupid people in this world. I woke up at 7:15 to go to an 8am class yesterday.  I was tired, but i was up and at class. So we start learning about the challenger space shuttle accident and how there was a problem with the decision making process which led to the accident. Now, this happened in 1986. There were not any females involved in the decision process for the launch back then. My teacher proposed a question...""would things have gone differently if a woman was involved?""  he then proceeded to give his opinion about how women might think more rationally than men when it comes to safety.  He proposed that a woman might have spoke her mind about the safety of the crew rather than worry so much about how NASA would look if they cancelled the launch again. i thought to myself, ""hmm...perhaps that is true."" My professor then continued on by asking the three females in the class if they believe that they females think differently than males. 

I sat there in between the three of them and expected a solid yes from them because obviously men and women think differently. Even if they had said no, i would have been okay with their answer because at least that would have showed that they actually had an opinion on the matter. But no, the three females decided that instead of answering it was better to look at each other to see what they would all say. WHY CAN'T YOU THINK FOR YOURSELF?!!? it was a simple question. not only did they do that but they did that dumb ""embarrased laugh"" as if they didn't know what to say or do, like it was a matter of getting an A or an F. I sat there and shook my head in disbelief.

I'm not generalizing women as being dumb in any way, i just can't believe the sheer stupidity of these three human beings. they are all seniors and its about fricken time they are able to answer a damn question when asked.....especially when it is a matter of giving a yes or no opinion!

"event","i watched the movie ""alive"" in class this morning. their plane crashed and was torn apart, yet there were some survivors...note the word some. reminded me of some things. the crashing part is over, now its just time to survive the coldness. the absolute bitter coldness, that was once so warm and comforting. i didn't get a chance to finish the movie, so i don't know if any of them made it off of the mountains and actually lived. i'm gonna go ahead and say they did...it gives me hope, but at the same time, i wrote down a quote from the movie that i found interesting...

""What's so great about hope?"" in reference to many of the surviving passengers and their hopes of being rescued by a search party.

So i sat there thinking. what is so great about hope? well lets start first by defining hope. by my own knowledge, i would say that hope is a tiny glimpse of anticipation for something good to happen. by actual definition it is To wish for something with expectation of its fulfillment. i think i was pretty close.

anyway, what IS so great about hope? the fulfillment or happiness that you wait for is usually not fulfilled in the end. i find that most hopes in life are just well traveled paths that lead to absolutely nowhere. a place of great dissapointment and emptiness. i decided that if you are going to hope for something that it better be something realistic. that your feet better be on the ground, otherwise you are just setting yourself up to reach destination nowhere and that little glimpse will, by then, have evolved into a an avalanche of falling snowballs, chasing you and each one will inevtiably catch up to you making you feel everything that you had hoped to escape by hoping."

But saving leads to bravery
To be direct

Hopefully searching

To reach it in a second, when its so far away

""don't rub it"" you will hear your mother say. ""it only makes it worse"" all you can do is sit and fight the urge to rub the hell out of it because no matter how many times your mom used to tell you that, you don't listen because at least now you are doing something other than just waiting for it to correct itself. after a few minutes of shear agony, you are able to open the opposite eye, it is fine but the poked one pulls it back into the darkness. then more time passes and slowly but surely the poked eye begins to open only to encounter light. it snaps back down repeatedly, but opening wider with each attempt. finally it it ends, leaving the unbearable pain behind to make another memory to draw on the next time it happens. it is a vicious cycle that i do and did not particularly enjoy...now or ever."

   Aside the fire, she sat patiently waiting. Candlelight aided the fire in lighting up the room. Perfectly symmetrical settings lay on the table she so delicately decorated. All that was missing was someone to share it with. Gazing into the fire, the hours passed. Burnt out candles marked the hours that had now passed. Red coals were all that remained of a once engulfed log. She finally decided that it was time to forget and swallowed the remaining half glass of wine from the bottle she opened to enjoy with her idea of good company. As she arose to her feet, headlights briefly flashed through the window. She composed herself and thought about what she would say to him. The options ran through her head, ""Who is she?"" the direct approach; ""Where have you been?"" give him a chance to lie approach; ""Why didn't you call"" another chance to lie; ""Is there someone else?"" the sad and vulnerable approach. None of these seemed fitting to her because she knew. The weekly roses, and nightly backrubs said he was better than that...that he loved her. As the footsteps got closer, and the jingle of his keys louder, she began to tear. Controlling herself the best she could, she stood staring in great anticipation. The door opened, allowing natural light to flood the room, crawling up her legs and illuminating her face. ""Good, you're still up,"" he said, ""Why are you crying?"" She offered no response as he approached her never breaking eye contact. Brushing the hair from her face he put his cheek to hers and whispered in her ear, ""You don't need to cry, You know I would never hide anything from you. I'm sorry I made you wait up."" As he pulled away, he lowered himself to a knee. ""I was picking this up."" From the darkness behind him, he pulled a tiny velvet covered box and lifted it to her. ""You are more precious to me than anything in this world. You keep me honest and I love you. Will you marry me?"" he proposed staring at her as she began wiping tears from her eyes. While revealing the ring, in a releived state of shock, one thought crossed her mind, ""I will wait for you forever, as long as you are honest with me always."""

"event","back here again, i find myself waiting in great anticipation. its often like this on these late nights. of my two options, i choose this one night after night. the soft cushion of my couch calls to me repeatedly.  i just cannot drag myself away, theres always that little glimpse of hope that keeps me here.  even tearing myself away doesn't seem to control the unbreakable magnetic force that draws my eyes back every so often to check if there is a change. inevitably i do fall asleep, only to be jostled from my sleep by remaining thoughts that stayed with me from the day. momentarily, i check back into reality to find what i had already found. as i sink back into my lonely slumber, i say to myself, ""maybe next time"".  But as those times continue to occur, so do the three words. so much even that they seem to change with the wind. forget. about. it. but it is impossible to rid yourself of that one thing. that one thing that you long for and have since you can remember. it is the one thing that drives you to go on from day to day looking and searching. it holds you captive, but seemingly it always ends up in one way or another; bittersweet. sometimes just sweet, sometimes just bitter, but unfortunately the ladder usually dominates.  i don't particularly enjoy when that happens. i don't know for sure but i can imagine that it is the same as being trapped under a 500 pound boulder.  not your entire body, but just a leg, or just an arm that prevents you from moving.  its not so much the weight of the boulder, but more so the feeling of believing that you will never escape that gets to us more than anything else. there is however, a very large and intentional BUT that comes along with this whole process...BUT when that one thing comes along, you suddenly have the strength to lift what you could not lift alone.  you are now free, however the freedom doesn't last.  it never does and never will. freedom is a figment of the imagination that everyone has been brainwashed to believe that they are given.  because once you do find that one thing, it only leads to a new boulder. one bigger, heavier, and much harder to lift, unless not lifting alone in which case, the one thing proves itself to be true.  there is no greater force. it is definitely out there, but like a diamond in the rough, it is the oasis to a lost soul in a desert, the fresh air so longlingly searched for and found after being dragged under. it is the phone call that gives the couch its comfy appeal. it still calls out, and now i will answer."

An evening spent with a lost friend and the normal.  it was exactly that...as normal as it always was. i miss you buddy, thanks for hanging out. we started with four, but we lost one more and we were down from four to my favorite number three...cept three isn't my favorite number, its twelve, however i thought throwing some mraz into the entry would be fun. it was. onward we go, WW1 happened as well. it was such a joyride, and after it was over, he fell to his knees and let go of the night. today we can look at that moment and see that it was a loooooong night. it has been a while, but the moon is bright. wait...the moon really isn't bright at all, it is the sun. the sun is bright. waiting for contact, i stood there stunned at the stillness.  they passed over, or under...i suppose noone really can tell. i couldn't tell either, i just looked and waited. it amazed me but it seemed as though what we expected was not the same as what it turned out to be. i often wonder if there is something more i should know. should i ask more questions, or just leave it known to those who already know? should i take what i am told to be true, or should i find out for myself? just where are those clouds...over or under?  i slept well. i was more comfortable last night than i have been in a while. comfort is something i value...theres only a couple feelings that are better then comfort, but i feel as though they go together. yeah, i'm pretty sure they do.  the morning was nice as well. though a constant buzzing in my ear, i was able to wash it away, like the once vivid distractions dancing around their little sombreros in my head. more plentiful than the great ball of the deep.  it was ridiculous. i waited as they were picked off from everywhere. above, below, from the middle...the battle raged on but they lost. thank god they lost. i just remembered something...they always do. i sit waiting...i feel i do a lot of waiting. usually id say i used to be pretty impatient but i don't mind now. i always do it, so why should it be a negative thing? it shouldn't...my dinner should be waited on, its still early. the hours do tick by quickly though, and i am just sitting here still. 





it would be nice if it were to here
casting away doubt and ridding of fear
it would be nicer to be there
a chance like that has already proven rare
it would be nicest to be anyplace
reading stories written face to face"

::::ok that was kind of a waste of time::::

-i stare off into the black ocean; there are tiny refractions everywhere staring down as we take flight, guiding us through an endless maze of time and space. there were little crystals causing electrical alterations, which dragged us onward on our journey...

~wow they are lucky~

...our destination unknown, but only one thing in mind.  perhaps two. we continued soaring, while we connected the dots toward a new level. one wrong turn, turned out to put time to good use.  it ended on a good note that triggered a sensory memory of the last expedition. another success.

bone chilling drafts sliced through our exposed appendages like tiny darts relentlessly being thrown directly at us.  time stopped, but continued once we reached the winter's oasis.  we were okay now, but yet again found ourselves in another maze of time and space.  destination known this time, but not to be reached before the combination of two opposites graced us with their free presence. what a find. home again we were pleasantly surprised to find what we had planned but forgotten.  a pattern emerged out of the dark box but was only to be tinkered with as we went on...

~that was disgusting~

...two more souls joined us in our journey into nothingness.  the tiny refractions returned above our heads, leading us again to a whole new level.  succeeding every time we try doesn't happen too often, but for some reason this night is different.  every seized opportunity heightens the experience to a new level just as the refractions once did.  a bar of gold sat idly on the ground waiting for its purpose to be figured out...by someone like us. it sole reason for being there would not be existent to any unenlightened individual.  we knew why it was there and quickly accepted its generosity for also knowing that word.  

the beginning of a whole new journey begins, leading us to a room of bliss. low tones offset the high pitches, and repetitious beats, while incubating chords dressed up the frame. completely surrounding us we jammed the only way we knew how. another good find, hopefully proven true...for their sake and our pleasure. 

the afterlife was cloudy. shapes dissapeared as quickly as they made their presence known to us. lost within ourselves, we were ready to be consumed by a soft fluff that isn't always this soft. new electrical reactions begin to occur, dimming the light to nothing but darkness, bittersweet darkness with awkward but seemingly real undertones.  a huge success coming to an end only to bring a new beginning...

~it's not his time yet~

...i sit here now, bemused at the fact that my memory is at the top of its game, only to waste away within days of its first occurence.  its time to go now and let it slip away as i would like to do myself. i am tired. goodnight"

i miss your lips,
i miss the way i feel,
when you give me that perfect kiss

i miss your eyes,
i miss your skin,
i miss when you look at me,
it makes my entire world spin

i miss your voice,
i miss your laugh,
i miss the way you talk to me,
it makes me feel whole,
like you are my other half

i miss your hands,
i miss your hair,
i miss sitting there for hours,
knowing we can just stare

i miss your dimples,
i miss your cheeks,
i miss being able to see you
but its only a few more weeks

i miss...

"event","money is the root of all evil. is it not? let us explore...

rich people have money, most of the ones i know are greedy. they do little to share.  i find that the people with the least are the ones that give the most.  its a value situation that everyone is in. maybe the rich don't share because they don't need the feeling of reciprocation, perhaps that is why the less fortunate are so gracious and willing to share what they have.  they just want the same to be done to them...the golden rule.

it controls everything that almost everyone on this planet does. the one rigid attitude that money solves everything shows through everyday activities, and conversations.  it is the main theme of everyday. this is sad to me. especially because i used to feel this way as well. money is nothing. sure it helps, but life shouldn't be focused on money.  at the risk of sounding cliche, people need to stop to smell the roses. as i look around me from day to day i see very little of this happenig.  mainly to the people closest to me.  its ashame. have you ever appreciated a dead leaf, or looked at the the way water is divided when interupted by a boulder or even a tree? appreciation is everything.  money takes away from appreciation. a picture is worth a thousand words...true, an appreciation is worth an infinite amount of happiness, so i say to you -fellow in the woods- ahndahgs to you sir, because you know how to appreciate. i am sure of that.

as if money itself wasn't problem enough, not having any of it certainly does indeed create more negative outcomes. it prevents people from having what they truly want all because someone at some point in time said to themselves, how can i be higher in status then you?...that one person should go down in history as single handedly destroying the humanity on earth.  what ever happened to FREE trade and once again the simple value of sharing that we were all taught at such a young age? they are non-existent and will be evermore. at least until i'm long gone. life would be easier for everyone if we truly lived by what we learned in kindergarten.  its true...everything i need to know, i did learn in kindergarten.  the person that wrote that childrens book is a genius.  he understands, and i say again...ahndahgs to you sir.

so i leave you with this...

what is it that you appreciate? are those roses fresh cut or have they been sitting in your wallet rotting away for years? will i look at you and say ""you understand...ahndahgs to you sir, or ahndahgs to you ma'am""?  is this whole entry really about money? questions left unanswered are answers left unquestioned...RIGHT??"

"event","The ride was good. It was even quality i would say. The banana pancakes we were enjoying went down so smooth, and as i drove on, i kept thinking....things are always better when we're together.  The more i drove the more i felt like i needed to call good people. so i did. it got me to thinking about the past. one, two, three, four......where did they all go? they all left me behind, but then i thought back to now. i am content. i am just sitting, waiting, wishing...

we had a playdough party...one of the coolest things i have seen happen with a random meeting of 3 uknowns.  it was awkward at first but the playdough set an example. it was flexible and free, and as we played we got along. it was nice to meet you. i will see you when i see you. you seem like good people too.

...for what i know, for what i want, and for my future to be written. like a story. do i get to write the chapters and have you write the title? will i ever know you that well, will i be the end of the story? amphibians, john, leela, and peter graced me with their presence for a couple of hours while sour cream and onion dissapeared into a dark tunnel, only to return when its time to play yahtzee. another communication link to good people...just to hear what i already knew. confirmed. thank you and ahndahgs. 
now i sit, listening, thinking, and reflecting...stay free, stay the same, play it straight, and own your name...because thats the best that any of us can do....be plain.

be the reason that i am."

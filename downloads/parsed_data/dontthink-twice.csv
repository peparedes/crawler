"event","Friday Lissa and Jake came over. It was a little weird and we had to have dinner with the family, which didn't help. Jake said that there was a party in LA and that we should go... why not, right? 

The party was pretty cool ...but it was nothing special. I saw Caz and we talked a little. It seems like everytime I see her we have so much more to talk about. Got to talk to Lissa more too. We started to talk about Jake ....and I was pretty surprised at how reserved she was. I guess she's been feeling obligated to stay with him. And ... I told her I loved her too much to see her miserable. I think she might've taken it the wrong way. I love her ... yeah. But, as cliche as it sounds, it's not that I'm <em>in love</em> with her. I might be, I dunno.  I guess she hated that so I left. Only later did I find out that that was probably the last time I was going to see her. 

I found her on my front steps at four in the morning and she told me that she was leaving on Monday. Her and Jake are going back to New York. So I'm probably never going to see her again. I wish that we didn't waste all that time apart that night. I had no idea. 

I drove her back to the party and watched her leave. Jake smashed into a car on the way out of the driveway. Great."

"event","This has been the longest week of my life (not counting that week in august). School sucks, everyone is busy with work, and Lissa left. She had to go to LA and live with her uncle? Because of her parents I guess.

It's weird because it feels like this summer never existed. Life is just how it was in the spring ... and everything that happened over the summer is gone again. I think I'd give anything to have it back. 

I feel responsible for so much.  If I hadn't asked Lissa out, Tim would've proposed to her. Sure, maybe I would've lost Lissa, but she'd be happy. And Tim would be alive. If only ... eh nevermind. I  don't feel like being miserable right now. 

I think I might try to go down to LA sometime this week and see what's going on with Lissa. We've only talked a few times since she left last week. The house is so quiet."

"event","I hadn't noticed how long it has been since I've updated. Last week sometime Lissa and Tim went to the carnival and I hung out with Caz again. We mostly played video games and sat around. When Lissa came back I noticed her throwing out the old pictures of Tim ... but she said she had fun.

And then yesterday me and Lissa hung out all day. It was really fun and amazing and I asked her out. I wasn't really planning on it but it just happened and she said yes. For the longest time neither of us really knew what was between us... but it feels good to know. 

I would type more... but my dad is yelling at me. I""ll update in the morning."

"event","An old friend of mine  got married two days ago. He's been going out with his girlfriend Ava since they were sophomores. Anyway the wedding was in LA and I had to get all dressed up and brush my hair and tie my shoelaces and everything.

So the wedding was nice and there were pictures and people cried and it took a surprisingly short amount of time. And then everyone threw things and we drove down near the ocean for the party thing. The food was good, I got to dance with Lissa, didn't have a very good conversation with Nina or Tim ... but they disappeared a lot. 

And after that we went home and slept. 

But I'm kind of worried because a friend ( friend? ) of mine is getting too involved in drugs and shit. He's kind of reminding me of myself last year.  I'd hate to just sit back and watch it get worse... but I think he hates me."

"event","I don't really know where to begin with the whole ""first entry thing"", so I think I'll ignore the fact completely that I've never written in this before. It's just so much easier - and is summer, I shouldn't have to think. 

Today I had a really good talk with Lissa after breakfast. I feel like I know her so much better now, which is probably a good thing since she's been living at my house for the past couple of weeks. For the first time in my life I like being home, because she's there. We talked about past relationships and old drug addictions. I had no idea she'd had such a tough past - and I felt so bad that she had to go through so much shit on her own. I'm so glad she's here now though. 

Anyway summer is going pretty fucking good, although the weather is still too cold for surfing. Only the real men are out there right now. I guess I'll mow the lawn like a big boy instead."

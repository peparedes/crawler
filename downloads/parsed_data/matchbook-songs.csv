"event","i've been in a hell of a funk this past week. i feel kind of lethargic, kind of walking through my life half asleep, kind of like ""what is the point of anything?"" i don't know. maybe all seniors feel this way with less than a month until commencement, maybe it has something to do with the philosophical way i've been feeling lately. hell, i don't even know if i exist, so why should i want to do anything? in addition to all of this, i've been having the craziest mood swings of my entire life. one second, i'm happy, the next i'm sobbing, the next i'm screaming. i can't explain it. i've been on the verge of tears for an entire week, and i just know, i know it, that something's going to set me off, and i'm going to start crying and not want to stop. i feel so overwhelmed and underwhelmed and ready and not ready and...basically terrified out of my mind. i feel worthless at times. i don't know what this all means. good god. i guess i'm just...afraid."

"event","so...

i'm sitting on my bed, clothed in a towel, my hair sopping wet, my windows open, listening to the garden state soundtrack, and thinking. just thinking. today on the way to ccd, as we were blaring frampton comes alive, we had a giant family argument/conversation, and we eventually came to the conclusion that...well, i might go to ysu. i wouldn't have to take showers with flip flips on, i would be close to everyone and everything, i might be able to get my own apartment, i could study journalism AND historical preservation, i wouldn't be in the middle of nowhere absolutely alone, i could save up for where i'm going after college, i wouldn't be 100,000+ in debt by the time i get out of college, i would get my own car FOR FREE (ummm...how in god's name could i pass this up?), everything would be almost paid for, i could get to know our new dog (who we're going to get this weekend in south carolina) and just about a million other reasons...yep. i just don't think ou is worth it after all.

what do you guys think?&nbsp;

"event","today was a helluva good day for the most part.&nbsp;
press day is always nice, because it means no school and traipsing around the ysu campus like immature teenagers for an entire day. this year's press day consisted mainly of skipping a whole bunch of not-so-interesting sessions, stalking tony marr and being a part of the back row of conspicuous struthers gals who attended that particular session, which was christened ""the tony marr one""(i honestly cannot tell you too much about that session. i was too busy...paying attention to other things. ahem.), hanging out in arby's and peaberry's and eating bagels and really greasy foods that will probably make my prom dress not fit me and sipping hot chocolate and hearing the zou and sneaking off around the ysu campus and going to the butler. totally worth it. we carpe diemed. for sure. i also really love schoolbuses, and it makes me sad that that was probably the last time i'm ever going to be on a schoolbus. maybe, maybe not. who knows? anyroad, when i got home, my pink laceweight silk yarn from england (that was freaking AIRMAILED to me) and my cds (carole king's 'tapestry' (BEST ALBUM EVER.), jenny lewis &amp; the watson twins's 'rabbit fur coat', and nick drake's 'bryter layter') came in the mail! and so did joann's coupons! YES. i hereby declare today, tuesday, april 17, 2007, a success. shazam.

love emmalee

p.s. i knit almost an entire sleeve at press day. good god!
p.s.s. i wonder if there's a new episode of 'house' tonight...hmmm...i can watch it while i write out 25 freaking envelopes for st. jude's. and do my psychology homework...among other things i keep putting off.
p.s.s.s. i TOTALLY got a $500 rotary scholarship! too bad $500 is like one book.&nbsp;sheeeeet son."

"event","<p><font size=""2"">new is a good thing.&nbsp;<br /><br />it seems that no matter how many times i listen to ""sad eyed lady of the lowlands"" it never gets old. i never, ever get tired of it. it's still as good as the first time i heard it on a rainy february afternoon in the best buy parking lot my freshman year. how many eleven minute songs can you say that about? anyway, i guess ""freebird"" is kind of maybe going to be our class song. wow. that's all i can say about that.&nbsp;<br /><br />you know what i've realized? i hate paragraphs. to hell with writing conventions! i'm making a list!<br /><br />one. i am currently a sittin' in my living room, home alone, blasting bob dylan. it is a very good feeling. however, prior to mr zimmerman, eric clapton's ""bell bottom blues"" (the LIIIIVE version - anything LIIIIVE, in my opinion at least, is FREAKING AMAZING) shook the walls so much that the ceramic angel hanging out on the ledge above the sofa fell off. whoops. no need to worry though...she's a-okay.&nbsp;<br />two. i feel kind of listless...like i should be doing something, something of at least minor significance, (can anyone say reading over senior surveys? ahem.) but i'm not.<br />three. college is ridiculously, i mean RIDICULOUSLY, expensive. yikes.<br />four. when will it stop raining and snowing and being thirty degrees in april? may? june? jesus h. christ. instead of finding a springy knitting project, i have decided to finish up the heavy wool sweater i was knitting in december. what the hell? why am i even thinking about wearing a wool sweater in april?<br />five. speaking of cold weather, it is going to be bloody freeeeezing at camp fitch. i feel very negative and pessimistic right now. sorry, luvvies.<br />six. i had a dream a few nights ago that on the day of prom, i was walking up and down youngstown poland road with gina martire for some reason.&nbsp;then, somehow, it got to be six thirty or so and i forgot it was the day of prom (?) and that i had a hair appointment and everyone was at my house and...it was bizarre as hell.<br />seven. i took the act today for some unknown reason. no further comments.&nbsp;<br />eight. my spring break mostly consisted of...hanging out in my bed all day reading and knitting, eating massive and obscene quantities of sweets, buying cds and yarn, going to the park, moaning about the horrible weather, and driving around semi-aimlessly.<br />nine. when chris and i went to sell his amp to new york music a few days ago, i saw kevin. and we sort of talked. and he seemed very very very pissed for some reason.<br />ten. it truly scares me to admit how much i <strike>like</strike> love chris.&nbsp;<br />eleven. the above was an extremely terrifying thing to type. wow.&nbsp;<br />twelve. i can't decide if simon &amp; garfunkel makes me terribly happy or terribly sad. i think it's a combination of both.&nbsp;<br />thirteen. a few days ago, my mum, liv, and i went out to look at graduation party things. my head almost exploded. we seriously looked through five huge books of the same exact invitations. god help us all.&nbsp;<br />fourteen. we have essentially one month of high school left.&nbsp;<br />fifteen. i really miss drama club.<br /><br />love emm</font></p>"

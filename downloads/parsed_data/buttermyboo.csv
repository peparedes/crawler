So today I can't decide how I feel.  Lots of random emotions...especially about mr. VA....you know...I just can't figure it out...and I just wish he would call.  Just because.  Do I really have to have a reason anymore???  So there's that...  I just thought I'd up this for Jen...because she's been on me about it and I never have time!  The END!!  Have a nice day!!

Love,
Jess"

"event","Dear people...

    So last night, I didn't get a lot of sleep...but that's alright...;)  Today was a tired day...I almost fell asleep in Theatre History a lot of times...many more than usual....and that's saying a lot.  Then I came back and lied to my boss...because I figured out that I was probably going to be scheduled for work the same day as the Vagina Monologues...and he was just a little upset...so that was a bad thing...cause he already had the schedule made up on the computer...opsie dasies!!
    Then I went to Nutrition Lab...where I found out that I passed my first lab...but not so hot...I really kinda suck at the whole lab thing...and then she didnt' help by trying to explain or anything...and so there's that...and I want to kill her...the end.
    I came back to the room and took Manda to the mail room...and then I had to go tanning...and I decided to drag manda along...half against her will...but it turned out well because she loved it!!!  Apparently all women are attracted to laying in heat at least half naked...I know I love it!!  So after tanning...manda and I came back to the room and waited for everyone else to get back so we could go shopping...which was fun...cause everyone came back and we all left!  
    First we went to Marshalls...which is an amazing place...lots of sales.  After Marshals, we went to applebees...where Manda and Rachel kept making eye contact with the people trying to go to the bathroom...which was a good time.  Shortly after I made an ass out of myself...because I misunderstood a lot of stuff...and I'm the asshole for the day!  
    After Applebees...we went to old navy...where we bought a lot of stuff...including those little quarter toys...that you get fromt the gum-ball looking machine...yeah...manda's idea :)  Then we went back to applebees...and got desert...:)
    It has been a great day!!  So there!!  Oh...everyone should come to our party on saturday!!  Because I said so!!

"event","Hello!  This is me.  And I just failed my theatre history test!  YAY!!!  Anyway...there is a lot going on in life.  I just found out that I will be singing I Hope You Dance for my cousin's wedding...and even thought it's her choice, I really don't think that's a wedding song...to whoever made that song...you are on the bad list.  
     Pippin rehearsals really start for real tonight...and I'm excited.  My boo and my rachie are with me and I'm real excited.  OH...and I don't have to work for four days!!!....and so I'm very excited about that.  My roommies and I are having a little get together again this weekend...which is always exciting...I just hope this one has less drama.  And Derek's coming up for the weekend on the 11th...and I'm happy...he's bringing Eclair Cake...which is EXTREEMLY yummy!!  I'm very excited about a lot of things as you can see...as Manda once said...if prozac were in human form, I would be it...which makes me laugh a lot.  oh....and Tax-free week is finally on the horizon...and I'm going shopping at some point...so that's exciting as well.  
     On a sad note...I have a nutrition test that I plan on failing tomorrow...so there's that...but on a happy note I'll probably see Jon tonight...which always makes me happy.  I'm so excited about a lot of things and I'm procrastinating right now...which is not so much good.  Anyway...that means that it's time to go!  Hope you have a good day!!! :)

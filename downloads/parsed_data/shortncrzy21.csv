Tell me why I should stay in this relationship 
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby 
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with 
I think that you should let it burn 

I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)

"event","wow.  it's been a while since i updated.  last time was over summer, after going to the cabin.  lots has been going on since then, so why don't i get it out for anyone who cares to listen.

let's see... i'll start with the good stuff.  i've been doing a lot of art since i moved to seattle, and selling a fair amount of it as well.  i guess that makes me an official professional artist.  i've also been getting paid to do theatre, which makes me a professional actor.  so as far as my artistic goals go, things are looking up.  a friend of mine and myself are writing two short plays each, then putting them together for a short (about hour and a half or so) one-act festival.  we're going to rent a theatre space in seattle and do it on the cheap.  it should be fun.  i'm writing one about my family, not creating any dialogue out of imagination, but using real events.  should be darkly humorous.  the other play i'm not so sure about... i'm tempted to do a more conceptual piece, maybe something about relationships or whatnot.  i'll let that one come to me in time.
i also passed on sfsu for grad school this last fall.  i just couldn't get the money together in time to move.  but, financially, i'm doing much better.  i'm a manager at red robin now which means i get more hours, overtime, and better serving shifts on the shifts that i do serve.  so, all-in-all, it worked out as a pay boost (which is nice, because for some servers it ends up being a pay decrease if they become a manager).  i'm saving money for grad school, a piano keyboard, a wii, and a trip to tibet.  i'm planning to go to tibet this summer with a friend of mine, and her and i will go touring the country, checking out buddhist temples and historical sites.  it's the kind of backpacking, escapist, eye-opening thing i think i need right now.
i've also been reapplying to grad schools with a different emphasis--now i'm going for a more literature/history-based degree so that i will be able to teach a wider variety of classes when i finally apply to become a professor.  berkeley, nyu, yale, u of washington, u of hawaii, boston u, emerson, uci, ucsd, ucla, sdsu, sfsu, unlv... i'm applying to all of them, so hopefully one will work out.  

now... sounds like all has been going well, right?  not so much.
as far as romance and relationships go... well, i had some time there when i was... well, for lack of a gentler description... not so picky.  i pretty much whored around for a bit, and made some ""what the hell was i thinking?"" decisions... but when i think about it, i never really had a ""slut"" phase in my life, so maybe that was it--just getting it out of the way after a string of unhealthy and abusive relationships where i basically got shit on.  maybe i needed that?

i've also realized in this time away from basically all my friends that i've become a very selfish person again.  i was doing so well all summer, really working on taking others' feelings and thoughts into consideration before acting on selfish desires.  but then i started doing coke again.  a lot of it.  and frequently.  i've since stopped, and i've been pretty good about drinking and whatnot too... but there was a good solid four months or so there that i was acting very selfish.  i was just involving myself with a lot of unsavory people and putting myself in unhealthy situations, both up here and to my friends in california.  a lot of lying, deception, and just general unpleasantness.  around new years, i realized that i was being a complete idiot, and that i've burned a good number of bridges that may never get rebuilt.  i've made the change and i've really made a strong effort to seperate myself from situations that are unhealthy or unwise.  i've been working, writing, reading and painting a lot, really centering my mind again--and i'm getting there.  i'm getting to that point where i realize i can enjoy myself and have a good time without engaging in hurtful or foolish actions.  it's hard, knowing how i treated people that i really care about.  looking back on how i acted, it's one of those things that, for me, is a ""live and learn"" situation, and i've accepted whatever losses or damage i've caused, but i care more about the damage and pain i may have inflicted on other people (not physically, of course--i'm a pacifist), and i can only hope that my actions, words, etc, have not had the degree of unpleasntness and impact that i imagine they could have.  
so.  my life is changing for the better now.  i've turned it around.  i'm eating better, exercising, creating art, and making a genuine effort to establish strong, healthy relationships with people i meet, and to rebuild the ruined relationships of people i care about.  i hit the bottom of the barrel there for a moment, but i truly feel like i'm beginning to take hold of the reins of my life right now.  and i'm trying to get back in contact with all my friends in sd and la with whom i've lost touch.  they are important to me, and i haven't been treating them like they are.  time to let them know i care and still think about them.
i'm truly excited about tibet--i really hope it works out and that i can actually do it, because i feel like i need that, i need to get back in touch with my buddhist side and immerse myself in it.  not only because i would love to make the physical journey, but also because i feel that i've hit the highs and the lows in my life that will allow me to take a very spiritual, mental journey as well--and that i will truly benefit from it and gain a better perspective on life and the world.  


so there it is team, a short re-cap of what i've been up to.  a lot of good, but a lot of bad as well.  but the bad is fading back into the darkness and things are getting lighter.  let's hope seattle continues to serve as an awakening, enlightening experience.  it's already run me through the shit, but it  also has inspired and motivated me.  it's a bipolar city.  but hopefully i will continue to learn from my experiences and i will continue to strive to improve my life and the lives of those i care about.  

until next time kids--same bat time, same bat channel."

"event","so... my parents and my sister came up to seattle yesterday (saturday) morning.  not a big deal.  right?
yeah.  you'd think.  we're going to the cabin on tuesday.  until then, guess where they're staying.  

yeah.  with me.  in my one bedroom apartment.  all 3 of them.  this is family overload to a capacity that you cannot even imagine.  all of a sudden, i went from having my own life, schedule, habits, time and space, to being invaded by my parents and my sister.  i haven't NOT been around them for over 30 hours now.  my sister and i sleep in the living room, my parents in my bedroom.  

it's sad to say, but it's actually made me really lethargic and kind of depressed.  i'm just exhausted, short-tempered, and sick of them constantly being around and nitpicking my apartment.  within the first five minutes my dad was asking for the broom and the vacuum so he could clean.  fuck him.  my apartment IS clean.  i cleaned it especially for them.  i can't watch my shows on tv because they constantly berate them.  i just got the boot from watching a new venture bros. so that my mom and sister (who outnumbered me) get to watch ""while you were sleeping"".  what the fuck?  this is MY place.  


and i thought that having my parents around would help me quit smoking, but i have been smoking about a pack a day just to calm my nerves.  i am so different from my family, i just can't stand being around them for this long in this small space.  gawd.

this is gonna be a LONG week."

"event","so, i had the most hick-tastic family come in to the dirtybird tonight.  here's a brief list of the actions/events/quotes that made me lose a small portion of my sanity and faith in humanity.
preface: dad, mom, and 2 daughters, probably 15 and 11, or so.

-dad orders a suicide.  i tell him that that's not one of our bar drinks.  he says, ""oh no, man, it ain't booze.  it's where you take all the stuff from the soda machine and mix it together.""  and i, with my wonderfully unfiltered mouth, say, ""oh, yeah, those things that little kids drink.""
-mom, after hearing my list of our beers (which includes guiness), asks ""what's a dark one?""  i say, ""guiness.""  she orders a ""giant one of those.""
-older daughter orders some ""sweet tea"".  i inform her that not only do we not have it, i have no idea what it is.
-younger daughter orders a chocolate coke.  a CHOCOLATE COKE.  sugar + sugar.  coke and chocolate syrup.  vomit.
-i bring the drinks.  the mom asks for a straw.  i get her a straw.  she drinks the guiness through a straw.  i don't even like guiness that much, and i felt she was disrespecting the beer.  i want to punch her.
-as for the food... we have a burger that has a fried egg on it.  the ""royal red robin burger"".  the only thing special about it is bacon and an egg.  the egg makes it super special.  i always find it strange that, for a restaurant named after a bird, serving food with an egg on it and calling it the ""ROYAL"" addition to the menu... that's just weird.  eating our mascot's fetus.  awesome.  anyway.  dad orders the royal burger with the egg sunny side up.  i tell him that that just won't happen.  sorry, pal.
-mom asks what salads we have cuz she's watching her weight.  (never mind the 4 pound beer).  i point out the light salads.  she orders the ""taco chili salad"", which, if memory serves, has about 3500 calories.  i inform her that it's a heavy salad.  she replies ""salad's salad.""  whatever, dumb bitch.
-young daughter orders dessert for dinner.  wtf?  was your chocolate coke not ENOUGH?
-older daughter orders the fiesta pollo salad.  she pronounces it ""fie-east-a polo"" salad.  not ""poyo"", like it should sound.  polo.  like, the sport.  neither mom nor dad seem to notice that she can't pronounce basic words that anyone whose ever had any sort of education should be able to pronounce.
-food comes.  everything but the dessert gets a generous dose of ketchup, mustard, tobasco, or a mixture of them. 
-before leaving, they ask where the nearest wal-mart is.  because, as the dad points out, ""it's my wife's birthday and she needs some beer"".  then, when i say that i don't shop at wal-mart and that i just moved here, they ask me where they can get cheap beer.  i tell them there's a safeway across the street.  they say, ""no, we're lookin' for a bar.""  at this point, i am confused.  they were just looking for a wal-mart.  do wal-marts in the south have bars in them?  or were they just gonna drop their kids off while they went and got drunk?  or were they going to take the kids to the hotel (or trailer) and dump them there while mommy and daddy went and got mommy plastered for her birthday?  at this point, my brain exploded.


... luckily, the man was a brain surgeon and saved my life.

um.  i hate rednecks.  well, some are entertaining.  others shake my faith in the human race.  which, as it turns out, was already a little shakey to begin with.

some people should not breed.  

and, i got the obligatory $1 per person tip.  classy."

i haven't been able to sleep at night lately.  perhaps the thought of all that i have to do before i move.  packing, saying goodbyes, etc.  i don't know how i'll do it all in a month and a half, and still have time to take care of myself.
so yes, it's official.  i got the ok from my aunt to move into her additional apartment in seattle for at least a few months or so, while i figure my shit out.  then, perhaps it will be off to grad school for me.  or perhaps not?  who knows?  all i know is that i'm sick of LA.  time to make a change.

"event","periodically, i will look at her myspace page.  i scan the entire page.  comments.  pictures.  personal info.  orientation.  relationship status.  i don't know what i'm looking for in particular.  i guess i'm looking for something, anything, that will make me jealous, upset, angry or sad.  there's lots there that could do that.  she's moving to georgia for her new boyfriend.  she's got new friends.  she's moved on.  etc.  
but the thing is... nothing i see, infer, interpret, read, or read into has led to any of those emotions lately.  i check it maybe once or twice a month as a sort of reminder that i let myself get too wrapped up in a person who didn't bother getting wrapped up in me.  we had a relationship that, now that i've had some time to reflect and react, i can see was built on lies and thoughts and feelings not said.  the only thing about it for me was that it was the first time i think i was truly in love with somebody.  or at least, it was the most i've ever felt for anybody i've been in a relationship with.  which is why it hurt so much when it ended.  both times.  
mistakes were made on both of our parts.  i'm not going to take the low road and blame her for everything, but at the same time, i'm not making the mistake i've made so often in the past and blaming myself for everything.  
but reading her myspace... it's become in recent weeks somewhat of a relief.  she's not the right person for me.  while i was with her, i was depressed, had low self esteem, and really gave up so much of myself that it sickens me to think that i was ever who i was then.  and then i look at all my friends, and i thank god they tolerated me and had the patience to say to themselves ""this too shall pass"" when i was being a selfish and demented prick.  reading her myspace, seeing her new life through the foggy lens of the internet, it actually has allowed me to gain the most closure i've ever had from this relationship.  it snuck up on me, too.  i now finally (and truly) have gotten to a point where i'm ready to start dating, to start giving myself to people again.  i had been so afraid to do that after being so badly hurt, but now, i'm ready.  i'm not afraid of being hurt any more, because i feel that i've grown and figured out what went wrong in the past.  i'm a stronger person.  
perhaps most of all, i have found that i just have no time for selfish, manipulative people in my life.   and i've learned to recognize them.  i'm happier now than i've been in a long while.  i'm stronger, i've got better people surrounding me, and i'm finally feeling good about myself, life, and relationships in general.  i see beauty in the simple things again.  the beauty of a slowly burning cigarette.  the beauty of the moon after a rain when the clouds are slowly migrating out of view.  life is so much better now.  and i think i just realized it recently.  
and i've finally gotten the closure i've been searching for.  not by anything she's done, but simply by the passing of time.  i feel enlivened now.  and i can look back on the relationship and appreciate the good times, learn from the bad times, and see things as they were.  i'm no longer jaded by emotion or attachment.  i simply see what it was, and who i have become because of it.  it's a good feeling.

plus, she was awful in bed.  that helps the closure a lot."

"event","so i work with this girl.  she's really cute, sweet, etc.  but she's pretty hardcore christian (as in, she almost went to pl nazbo university).  whatever.  i have an open mind.  we've been flirting and whatnot, and i was thinking ""maybe after dating complete psychos for the last 2-3 years, i could give a nice wholesome christian girl a shot.  maybe it might be just what the doctor ordered.  
so we were talking about movies.  favourite movies, etc.  told her mine was magnolia.  told her what it was about.  she wanted to borrow it.  lent it to her.  this was a week ago.  saw her yesterday.  asked her if she'd watched it yet.  she said she watched the first 15 minutes and that she was liking it so far, but the language was getting to her.  at that point, i knew that the fantasy was dead.  but, what the hell, give her a little shock, right?  i told her to keep watching, and that the language kind of fades away.  ha. 

she hasn't made it to the tom cruise part yet.

but what has this taught me?  maybe i need corrupted, psychotic people in my life.  maybe my mind is so warped and my mentality so blunt and my outlook so stoic that good, wholesome people just aren't on my relationship menu (be it as a friend or as something more).  am i too fucked up to find someone stable?  am i destined to be one of those people who jump from unhealthy relationship to unhealthy relationship until i find someone whose relationship health is as fucked as mine, and we just settle into a comfort zone?  or is that itself so far out of the realm of possibility that i will not even be afforded that small luxury?

"event","last night, i had a dream that jung and freud were waiting in line for splash mountain.  they were having some sort of argument about personality types, etc, and i was listening through that part in the line where the line loops around and you can see through the holes in the ""cave wall"".  freud said something about how jung better speed up his research because freud was getting more attention, and jung said ""i'm doing the best i can, i'm rushin'.""  which was quite the pun (""im russian""), if only jung was from russia.  nonetheless, i hold it in high regard that i actually formulated a complete (albeit historically inaccurate) pun, not to mention that it was so complex and it involved freud and jung, as opposed to the one i thought of yesterday... it's long but i like it: noah was busy one day, building a bicycle.  his neighbor passed by and asked what noah was building, and noah replied, ""why, i am building a bicycle because the lord commanded me to.""  the next day, noah was again working on the bicycle, when his neighbor passed by once more.  his neighbor, noticing that noah had made little progress, asked when he planned to finish the bicycle.  noah replied ""the time is not the issue, just simply that the lord wants a bicycle.""  this sort of thing happened for weeks, with noah making little practice.  finally, one day, the neighbor walked by, and noah was no longer working on the bicycle.  he was buidling what looked to be a giant ship.  he inquired as to what the ship was for.  noah told him that the lord wanted a ship to be built, and that the lord would flood the world and this ship was the only way to survive.  the neighbor replied ""well, what about the bicycle you've been working on?"", and noah said to him ""well, the lord saw how long the bicycle was taking, and since the lord plans to flood the world soon, he told me: 'noah, your ark is first, then your bike.'""
...

....... get it?
i'm hoping at least sean gets the stupidity of this.  just say it out loud.
but yeah.  that was bad.  and somehow in my dream i made a pun involving jung and freud.  i don't know how i came up with the more intelligible of the two puns in my sleep.  strange."

"event","so..... what's the deal with black people?
anyone who knows me knows that i am not a racist.  i do think hitler is adorable, but im not a bigot.
but god damn.
black people do NOT tip well.  at all.  you can give them the best service, be friendly, do favours, run your ass off for them, but for some reason, 10% seems to be the best tip i can manage.  and not just me, everyone at chili's agrees.  and it's not all black people.  sometimes you'll get 15% or maybe more, but that's usually one out of every dozen black tables.  
ok, i get it.  my great great great great grandparents probably owned your great great great great grandparents, and for that, you don't owe me anything, especially not a good tip.  get the fuck over it.  
i had a friend who had a party of 10 black people tonight.  the bill was $166 and some change.  he was nice.  he was attentive.  he was fun.  we sang them happy birthday.  they got a free milkshake.  a couple of the women at the table gave him a hug as they were leaving.  they kept talking about how good their service was.  when he went to collect the cash, after they had left, he found that he had $170 bucks left in the check presenter.  $166 was the bill.  gratuity not included.  they left $170.  i mean, really?  3 bucks and some change?  i guess the hugs were his tip.  
and that's not even an extreme example.
yeah.  this job could easily make me somewhat racist.
maybe it all goes back to the educational system, and how we keep the blacks from getting proper educations, and they just don't know math.
i just don't know what it is.
yeah, get mad at me for posting this.  but if you've ever waited tables, and you're white, and you've had black guests, try and tell me differently.
just try.
argh.
kind of makes me want to go to work in blackface."

i go to san francisco on friday for my nyu audition.  fucking nervous, but i have my monologues and my song and i think i'm prepared.  nyu would be way too expensive for me, but hell, if i get in, i'm gonna find some way to make it work.  me in ny.  strange thought.  i also heard back from uc irvine (woot.) and i have an interview in 2 weeks for their graduate directing program.  they don't call everyone back for an interview, so that's a good sign, right?  even though it's irvine.  whatever.  grad school is grad school.  if i get in there, it's a good back up in case i don't get into my first choices.  also applied to ucsd, but i don't know if i want to retreat back to san diego.  i need to broaden my horizons.  berkeley or sf would be ideal.  but goddamn i wish i could go to seattle.  that's the place for me.  maybe after grad school.  or if i don't get in anywhere, i'll move there and apply at UW again next year.  we'll see.  goodness me, so much going on.  i love it.

"event","doesn't hitler's ""contemplative"" icon look so adorable!  aawwwwww adolf!
so, with my job at activision, when i would tell people that i was a video game tester, they would always go ""wow, that's so cool!  you must have so much fun!"", etc.  but that wasn't true.  it was far from fun--it was tedious, repetetive, and banal.  i think i lost brain cells working there, and i definitely gained weight, what with all the soda and snacks readily availiable to keep us awake with sugar rushes and whatnot.  and i didn't like 80% of the people there.  
now, i got a job as a server at chili's, and when i tell people that, they go ""chili's?  why?"", as if it is a bad thing.  it's more money than i was making at activision (well, not base pay, but if you include tips, it'll most likely be more), it's a more social environment, and it's active.  i've already lost weight just by not going to activision every day these last 2 weeks (i've been going about twice a week).  i don't get it.  this is a good change, much overdue, and probably more emotionally and physically healthy for me.  why does everyone react like i'm flipping burgers at mcdonalds?  
anywho.
i also feel overqualified for chili's.  maybe that's because the two girls i'm training with are both dumb as rocks.  they couldn't remember what an awesome blossom was or what it contained.  really?  chili's signature food and you can't remember the THREE FUCKING INGREDIENTS?  and don't get me started on how bad they spell.  we filled out faux tickets today to get used to writing down orders.  they can't even spell the abbreviations correctly.  i don't understand.  ""aisle"" became ""isle"", ""broccoli"" became ""brockily"", etc.  
awful.
and one of the girls is this stupid 18-year-old girl who reminds me of all the stupid girls at PL.  answering her cell phone in the middle of training.  good god, woman.
aaaaanywho.  chili's will be good for me.  
in other news, padfoot's new favourite place to play is in the box i use to take him to the vet.  he willingly gets in it and plays/hides/sleeps.  ALL THE TIME.  to me, that's the equivalent of a convict who is sentenced to death having his favourite chair be the electric chair.  and he bites.  padfoot, not the convict.  he bites like a motherfucker.  he's bloodthirsty and psychotic and i kind of feel like i named him appropriately, not because he is similar to sirius black, but because he is similar to what the wizarding world THOUGHT of sirius black.  cold-blooded killer, etc..  
in even other news, stephanie tanner had a meth problem.  so says an article on yahoo.com.   awesomeness to the max.  but bob and mary-kate and ashley and john all staged an intervention.  how rude!
scrapping the charles in charge screenplay (well, not so much scrapping as putting on the backburner) to focus on a wicked screenplay.  im nearly finished.  it could be such a fucking awesome movie.
and, ironically, this song came on right as i was about to write what music i was listening to.  funny how coincidences happen."

"event","as i'm reading ""wicked"", i'm noticing that it would make a really interesting movie.  not a musical (i haven't seen the musical, but i'm sure it's good), but like a darkly comic movie.  the visual style could be similar to ""lemony snicket"", or tim burton-y stuff (edward scissorhands, beetlejuice, nightmare, corpse bride).  
my friend proposed the idea of a castlevania movie, and it's going to be made, and he's making BANK just for suggesting the idea--he didn't have to make a screenplay or anything.  perhaps i should write a screenplay treatment of wicked and try to sell it.  
after i sell my ""charles in charge"" remake screenplay first, that is.

contemporary comedy:
-""boy's life"", phil
-??????

contemporary dramatic:
-""six degrees of separation"", rick
-????????????

classical comedy:
-""much ado about nothing""
-""love's labours lost""

classical dramatic:
-""king lear"" (edmund)
-""richard iii"" 

songs:
?!????!?!?!??

so if anyone has any suggestions for any of the above categories, i would be much indebted!  so much so that, if you're in SF on the night of the 11th and want a free night of drinks or dinner or sexual favors, i'll whore myself out for the help!

as for songs, i'm debating any of the following:
-""dentist"" from little shop (for those of you who know me well enough, that's a no-brainer)
-""gaston"" from beauty and the beast
-""my unfortunate erection"" from 25th annual putnam county spelling bee
-""suppertime"" from you're a good man charlie brown
-""heart and music"" or ""sailing"" from a new brain
-""loved by mary lane"" from reefer madness
-""king herod's song"" from jesus christ superstar
-something from the muppet movie maybe?

"event","all my entries lately are about how crappy i feel and how i hate LA.

this isn't any different.  enjoy!

i've been in a rut.  i'm more depressed these last couple weeks than i have been in years.  i don't know why.  i think it's the anticipation of moving out of LA, coupled with the sad realization that i'm still stuck here for 5 or 6 more months.  god.  i want to be doing something with my life, not working at a video game company wasting my time away.  i could be auditioning, i could be exploring, i could be traveling, but no, i need money to pay bills.  
lots of other things have been weighing on my mind lately as well.  my ex is moving to georgia for some guy she barely knows, and while this shouldn't bother me, it nonetheless is making me a litte testy, more because i'm mad at myself for all the energy i put into the relationship, and all the lies i received and accepted from it.  i just feel like i could have been making such better choices.  but, oh well.  perhaps i made the stupid choices so that now i know for sure that the right choices are out there and must be made next time.  why do learning experiences have to be so damn painful and lengthy?  that's not fair.  i'm an old soul, this is my last life in my karmic cycle probably, i should know all this already, damn it!
eh.  no use in crying over spilt milk.  this time in LA will just spark the fires of creativity and hopefully will keep me motivated to find a strong, secure direction in life.

in other news, i got my GRE scores, and i scored a PERFECT on the analytical writing section, which will hopefully even out my average reading comprehension score.  so that's sweet.
and i got an audition with NYU on february 11 in san francisco.  ive never been there, so hopefully i'll stay the whole weekend and explore the city.  speaking of, is anyone in the san fran area and feeling like putting me up for the weekend?  i'll pay you in dinners and drinks and drugs.

"event","so, in honor of martin luther king, jr., google paid a fitting tribute to his legacy.  they made his face appear as the second ""O"" in the word ""Google"" at the top of the page.  
i really think that that would have made him proud.  to know that all of his hard work, passion, and struggle was met with a congratulatory salute from google.  oh, how i long to one day become the second ""O"" in google.

... sarcasm.

also, there was nothing that had replaced the first ""O"".  why wasn't he the first?  is he not good enough to be the first ""O"" in ""Google""?

probably not."

"event","last night i went to dave & buster's in irvine.  if you've never been, it's essentially chuck e. cheese's for grown-ups.  an arcade, ski ball, DDR, etc., all with a huge bar!  beautiful.  i spent a lot of time playing the star wars trilogy game and house of the dead 4, killing zombies and whatnot.  all while drinking.  it was just like any other saturday night at my place!
then we left there at like 1, and since i was already about halfway to san diego, i decided to make a late-night trek to the cliffs.  i got to the cliffs at like 230 and the moon was so bright and there were these huge puffy post-rain clouds on the horizon, and the moon lit up the outlines of the clouds, and reflected the waves so well, it was almost like it was daytime.  and the waves were so big and loud and goddamn i miss sunset cliffs.  that made the drive worth it.  it also cleared my head, there's been a lot of crazy developments in my life right now and it was nice to just be somewhere where i could relax and forget about everything.  like, EVERYTHING.  
then i headed back up to la at like 330 in the morning, got here and passed the fuck out.  
i miss a lot about san diego, but seeing the cliffs definitely made me look forward even more to getting the hell out of LA.  bay area?  seattle?  new york?  europe?  who knows.  but not here, that's for sure."

<li><b> annie hall</b>:<br>pretty much the best romantic comedy ever.  and it doesn't end on a terribly happy note, either, which is what i like about it.  both parties are at fault in their own regards, and it doesn't take the whole ""women are awful"" approach that sometimes male-driven movies do.  and it was before woody got all pedophilic and shit.  which is good.</li><li><b> college</b>:<br>yeah.  i'm interested in it.  so much so that i went to it for four years, am going to go back to it for 3, and am going to teach at one.</li><li><b> directing</b>:<br>like it more than acting.</li><li><b> family guy</b>:<br>the dog is an alcoholic, and the baby wants to murder his mother and rule the world... and they both talk.  awesome.</li><li><b> hamlet</b>:<br>had a great time when i was in the show a couple years ago, and love the play.  wrote on its connection to buddhism for my senior honors thesis.</li><li><b> macbeth</b>:<br>ironic that 2 shakespeare plays are here.  and his 2 biggest tragedies, at that (well, lear is in there also, but i think these are his 2 most famous).  great play.  see ""scotland, p.a.""--christopher walken as macduff and andy dick as the head witch.  enough said.</li><li><b> penguins</b>:<br>DUH.

... i believe i can fly.</li><li><b> star wars</b>:<br>best film trilogy ever.  well, in the trilogy of best trilogies.  i'll say the best trilogy trilogy is star wars (and by star wars, i mean the original 3, not the crappy 3 new ones), lord of the rings, and... wait for it... wait for it... the godfather.  3 wasn't as good, but 1 and 2 more than made up for 3's lameness.  i also could throw indy in there, but i figure the lucas/nerd quota was covered with the first 2 trilogies in the list.</li><li><b> twelfth night</b>:<br>ANOTHER SHAKESPEARE PLAY?  crazy.
my favourite of shakespeare's plays.  so wonderfully beautiful...
and the only instance (that i know of, and i'm pretty sure it is actually the only one) where the fool is the main catalyst for the villain's downfall (malvolio,  in this case).  usually it's the protagonist or the main character.  here, it's the fool.  how wonderful is that?</li><li><b> writing</b>:<br>yup.  i likes me to write.</li>

i think i'm going to start using the phrase ""ong bak"" as a cuss word.  then, hopefully, people will respond with ""the thai warrior"".

that came out of nowhere.

i come to sandy eggo on friday night LATE, then i stay till like the 27th or the 28th, because i have to get back up here and take my GRE on the 29th and i need some study time.

speaking of, does anyone have any good ideas on how to expand my vocabulary in a week and a half?  i had a great vocabulary when i graduated high school, but i think college made me stupid, and now i have crap for a vocabulary.  i need to brush up.  my math scores are great, i'm not worried about that at all, but i definitely need help on the verbal.  (sean, i'm looking at you.  any good study tips/books?)

ok, it's 1130 and i'm tired and slightly drunk and i need to get some sleep before work.  i don't sleep well any more.  so hopefully i'll actually fall asleep before like 4 tonight.  laaaame.

"event","wow.  lots of craziness lately. this deserves a all-too-rare livejournal post.

christmas party thing on saturday night at our place.
aj + (1/2)(jug of carlo rossi paisano wine) + (vodka + hawaiian punch) + beer + 2(gin + tonic) + cell phone = probably far too many drunk dials/texts.  oops.  oh well.  its fun to look like a douchebag sometimes.  yay!

today laura, brian, maggie and i went to the land of disney.  it was SO amazing.  after a slight bit of trepadation when we arrived (for the first time EVER i saw signs saying ""Be warned: Disneyland is EXTREMELY BUSY today.""--it actually made me wonder if they ever fill the park to capacity and have to turn people away.  ""sorry, Disneyland is closed.  we're full.""), we got to the park.  waits weren't too bad, surprisingly.  first we went on the new and (highly) improved space mountain.  SO much more awesome and dizzying and scary and you can barely see the track now at all so it feels a lot more crazy.  then we hit up some splash mountain, haunted mansion (all nightmare before xmas-ed), pirates, indiana jones, etc., then went over to california adventure, rode tower of terror (twice), the crazy loop rollercoaster (twice), the maliboomer (which basically shoots you up in the air and makes you crap your liver out), and ate some pizza.  then it was back to disneyland for some buzz lightyear astro shooter game, which was like a video game/ride, which kicked ass, then some matterhorn (which i swear pieces were actually breaking off while we were riding it.  i hate that ride.  too old.), then we watched the fireworks show which was SO AWESOME i quite literally pooed myself.  it was like the 50th anniversary fireworks show, and they had fireworks to match up with different rides (haunted mansion, pirates, star tours, indiana jones)... i wont ruin anything because there were some brilliant surprises and weird things, but it was easily the bestest fireworks show i've ever seen.  then it snowed on main street (but it was actually soap/foam bubbles, but it was the closest ive ever gotten to the real thing so i was happy).  then we rode thunder mountain, which was way scarier now that all i was thinking when i was riding it was ""this thing totally broke apart and killed a guy and injured a lot more and there were bodies strewn across the tracks, and that was like a month ago"".  so that made it really scary.  then jungle cruise, then... dead.  we left, but we got a LOT done and it was such a great trip, i'm still just stupidly grinning.  

however, 2 BRILLIANT moments today that i must write down to preserve in history:
moment A: while walking through a group of people waiting for the fireworks, and main street was crazy mad crowded, i just say loudly ""why are there so many KIDS everywhere?"" and a little boy walking with his dad (he couldn't have been more than 6) turns back and looks me dead in the eye and says ""merry christmas"", with the most condescending tone i have EVER heard in my life, even from my own mouth.  it was so strange.  

moment B: i'm in the bathroom going pee, and the following exchange takes place (paraphrased, of course) at full volume right next to me.  scene: a father (roughly 35) is at a urinal while his son (roughly 5) stands behind him.
Son: I wanna wide the wocket ship wide.
Dad: We already rode the rocket ship ride.
Son: No we didn't.
Dad: What about Space Mountain?
Son: No, I want to wide the wocket ships.
Dad: We already rode those.
Son: No we didn't!
Dad: Then what was that ride we went on with the red and white things we went flying around in that were exactly like space ships?
Son: Not that one, the other one, over there. [points]
Dad: Oh, you mean the Golden Zephyr?
Son: Yeah.
Dad: That's not the rocket ships.  That's the *Golden Zephyr*.
Son: Ok, that one.
Dad: We already rode the rides *you* wanted to go on!  Now we're gonna go on rides Daddy wants to go on.
Son: [Beat] You're peeing for a long time.
Dad: Yeah, well... Daddy's had a lot to drink today.  [at this point, i leave the bathroom]

The dad was SOOO rude and bitchy to his son, it would be hard to tell which one was older if you didn't have the visual confirmation.  And the end of the conversation could not have been scripted batter if you tried.  BEAUTIFUL.  i love it.  

on that note, i'm off to bed.

ps: quick life update--feeling much more grounded and centered with each passing day.  finding myself much happier in general, which is nice.  ready to get out of LA though, dealing with grad school applications to facilitate that.  who wants to move to seattle with me?  anyone?  anyone?"

"event","so yes, here i am again.  it has been quite some time since my last update, and i don't know if anyone actually reads this/cares about this...

i moved into a new apartment with a couple friends of mine, laura & kimi... somewhat strange living with females, but not something that bothers me.  actually, so far, it's working out amazingly.  we get along great and the living situation at the moment couldnt be better, i have the master bedroom w/ my own bathroom which kicks ass.  
also, i'm working at activision (the video game company) as a game tester.  definitely grunt work, but good money and good people surround me, so that's a plus... lots of other new news to report, but like always, i shall save that for a later entry.

for now, i'm exhausted, but feeling neglective towards livejournal, so i decided to post a small tidbit of text to let those who care know that i'm still alive and kicking.

t.t.f.n.

"event","I came to a sad, painful realization this morning.  I'm an asshole.  I'm selfish, disrespectful, and self-centered.  I keep toting my desire not to hurt other people, and yet i keep doing it.  i keep putting myself in situations that are entirely within my control in terms of keeping things pain-free, but then i go and get selfish and start screwing things up.  i only see other people when i feel it's convenient for me... i've stopped trying to get ahold of people because if i can't do it in one try, when i want to, then i guess something inside me just goes ""fuck it"".  
i'm sick of being that guy.  i'm sick of being that guy who has hurt so many people.  i've got to change my ways before it comes around to kick me in the ass.  karma is a bitch, and i've already got my fair share of it, but i just know that there's so much more yet to come.  i hate that.  and look at that, selfish.  now i'm worried about how karma will affect *ME*.   fuck.
i don't want to hurt people, i don't want to be that guy who people regret having anything to do with.  it's not worth it, and others don't deserve it.  i never mean to hurt people, but it just *happens*.  i hate that.  i need to really do a lot of soul-searching and just figure my shit out and not have anything to do with anyone until i can get to that point where i can be more selfless than i've been in the last few years... 
anyway... it's been a while since i've updated anything, so here goes...
i graduated from college a few weeks ago.  it was crazy.  i'm now officially an adult.  fucked up.  i went down to san diego the other week to finish up a little tooth surgery (i had a fifth wisdom tooth pulled, which means one of three things: either i'm (A) extra wise, (B) a mutant, or (C) an extra wise mutant), and while i was down there my car broke down and would have cost more to fix it than the car is even worth, so i used my dad's credit and i got a brand spankin' new car.  2005 honda civic lx.  it's cool, it's not really my style of car, but it'll do--plus it ended up being cheaper per month than it would have been to get a used car.  weird.  but then again, there's another 200 bucks a month that i've gotta pay for.  fuck, i need a job.  i'm definitely going through the post-graduation depression, but on the good side, i dont eat much cuz i'm both too depressed to do it and because i can't afford to, so i'm losing weight!  yay.  
well, that's basically been my life.  just a lot of what-the-fucking and trying to figure out how to pay for life.  
i'm sorry to any of you who i have hurt.  i'm going to stop doing that.  none of you deserve it, and i'm shit for having done it.
time to go clean my apartment."

"event","ohhhh man.
lots of shit to talk about, but again, procrastinating.  
i saw episode iii last night at midnight.  yeah, i'm just THAT nerdy.  but nonetheless it kicked SO much ass.  except for the love scenes.  never has there been such horrible dialogue since... well... the last star wars.  

anakin: you're so beautiful.
padme: you're just saying that because you're in love.
anakin: no--i'm saying that because i'm in love with *you*.

barf.  no joke.  that's not even the worst of it.  
the mushy shittily-written love scenes aside, it was pretty freakin awesome.  yoda kicked ass.  sammy jackson kicked ass.  palpatine kicked ass.  chewbacca and the wookiees kicked ass.  anakin kicked ass.  obi-wan kicked MAJOR ass.  and R2-D2 kicked more ass than anyone, in my opinion (i say this in regards to the amount of ass-kicking he did in relation to his size and lack of traditional weapons).  ewan mcgregor stole the show (along with yoda and sammy)... and hellz yes i'm still pumped about it and i'm probably gonna go see it again soon.  
man, i'm a geek.

ps: C3-PO is a bitch.  


pps: i'm juice fasting right now and all i want is a cheeseburger.  sooo bad."

"event","1. Total number of DVD/VHS I own:
i'd say somewhere in the upper 100's, lower 200's total... about 120 dvds, and then a lot of vhs.

2. The last film I bought:
well, i bought 3 at the same time: star wars: episode ii; the many adventures of winnie the pooh; monty python and the meaning of life (special edition)

3. The last film I watched:
last night i watched robocop 2 on tv.  but if it was one of *my* actual films... the many adventures of winnie the pooh whilst falling asleep (miss kelly, this is strange)

4. Five films that I watch a lot or that mean a lot to me:
wow... what defines meaning a lot to me?  who knows.  well, let's get to it.
1.  magnolia.  by far my favorite movie.  such amazing performances by everyone in it, and such an onslaught of emotion.  love it.
2.  the rocky horror picture show.  duh.
3.  star wars: episode v.  when leia says ""i love you"" and han solo says ""i know"" as he's sinking into the carbonite chamber... wow.  so good.  what happened, lucas?  
4.  annie hall.  ok, it's ""woody allen's masterpiece"" (next to manhattan) but i still love it.  such a great movie on relationships.
5.  the muppet movie.  movin right along is one of the best songs EVER.


5. Tag 5 people and have them put this in their journal.

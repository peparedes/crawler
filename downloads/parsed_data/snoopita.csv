Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatagequiz/"">What Age Do You Act?</a></div>"

"event","<P>&nbsp; I took the day off today, because I still have 20 hours of floating holiday time to blow through, so I'm actually going to write something here! My computer was buried under a pile of laundry that didn't get done for a month. I went up to the laundry room a couple of times, but all of the washers were being used, and it was raining, so I never went back to check, so it didn't get done until last week. <BR>&nbsp; Rhys ordered me a new keyboard, because mine broke AGAIN. This one is tiny, like a laptop keyboard, which is what I'd been wanting to get, because I was used to the size of the laptop. But now I have gotten used to regular, big, clunky keys, so I have to get used to the smaller keys again. The best thing is that I can fit both the keyboard and the mouse on the keyboard tray, so I don't have to reach up for the mouse all the time. <BR>&nbsp; I have been addicted to Animal Crossing for the last couple of months. I think my house is as big as it can get. I almost got all of the dinosaur bones. And I've been doing well on the Fishing Tourney. It's ok if you don't know what I'm talking about- trust me, it is AWE-SOME!<BR>&nbsp; I have also been watching the Michael Jackson re-enactments on E! The are AWE-SOME! as well. I have no idea what the actual people look like. If I'm watching the news and they talk about them, I just picture the actors. I don't even know what Michael Jackson looks like anymore, which is a blessing.<BR>&nbsp; Today I finished reading Lewis Black's book. I recognized most of it from his rantings on the Daily Show and from his stand up, but it was pretty good. It is the second book I have actually read the whole way through this year. The other one was, of course, America: the Book. What does that say about me? That I like to watch shows about TV and read books about TV.<BR>&nbsp; I have gone to 2 Yoga classes. There is a school of Yoga a block from my place, so I've been going on Saturdays. The lady there confirmed that I am in fact too short to do some of the poses. So, it's ok if I can't grab my ankle with my hand, I can just hold my knee. I came home from the class on Saturday, and Rhys had cleaned the dishes! I was so happy! I even got to take a nap.<BR>&nbsp; That's about it for now...</P>"

"event","There is a perfectly good explanation as to why I've gone MIA: I moved! First, I was looking for a place to live. Then, I found one and had to pack. Then I moved and had to unpack all the shit I had just packed. And since I only have weekends to do that, along with everything else I have to do, It took some time to settle down. I've almost got it. We have to return some boxes we borrowed to Rhys' mom's attic, cause I'm tired of looking at them. We got surfaces to put most of our crap on, so the computers are up!

It's a really nice place! It's 2 blocks away from work, so I get to walk there every day. It's a new building, so it's very clean and the appliances are nice. we are on he ground floor, so we have a front door that faces the parking lot. All utilities are included with rent, even cable and internet, so we don't have to worry about paying a lot of different bills. And no stairs! so i'm very happy! 

Rhys' birthday was this week, so we go a gamecube! It's so cool! He got me Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, and I am so happy! I need to get a new keyboard, cause my tab, shift, backspace and ""t"" are acting up, and it's really annoying. So I'll go for now, but I will probably have more time to write (and more things to write about!)"

"event","Yes, I am alive, thank you very much for asking. My class ended last week, and I've been on a cleaning spree ever since. I did ten loads of laundry last week, and almost as many dishes. I cleaned up after Bronwyn and vacuum the living room and dining room. I started to throw away a lot of stuff we had on files that we didn't need. Hopefully there will now be a place for everying, and Rhys will be able to easily find things. I still have to tackle the closet, take stuff that we don't use that often up to the attic, and get rid of anything we really don't need or will never use. I hope to be done by New Year's. 

I have two days off, Monday Jan 3 and Tuesday Jan 4. I plan on sleeping in late and playing with Bronwyn. 
She went to see Santa on Saturday:

"event","I sold out for nothing. I'm sorry, Ralph! I did what I thought I had to do to get a somewhat-competent president in office. You got suckered, middle-America. Now we get four more years to fight against gay marriage, find more ways to desecrate our land, and then conquer the Moon and Mars. Because those are the REAL issues. I guess what you really value is arrogance. I just want our president to be smarter than I, is that so wrong?!"

"event","<P>Rhys started working this week. It was very stressful for him, and he didn't feel like I was being supportive enough of him. I have to agree. I feel very sad about it. I thought he was just tired and hungry, so I left him to go make food for him (I was waiting for him to come home from work so i could cook for him). I didn't notice that he was in the verge of tears. He came upstairs and started telling me about his problem at worked. It seemed to me like a misunderstanding, so I tried to give him a different perspective. We ended up having an argument about it. He just needed me to be supportive of him, hold him and tell him it was going to be ok, and I couldn't do that. I need to learn that being supportive does not mean telling him that he is&nbsp;always right and everybody else is&nbsp;always wrong. There is always time later to sit down and discuss what we think. At that moment, he just needed me, and I wasn't there for him, so he banged his head against the wall because he ""just wanted it to stop hurting"".</P>
<P>I hope I can be more empathic from now on and let him know that I love him and support him, and that I am not judging him. I love you, Rhys! I'm sorry!</P>

"event","I am one class away from graduating with an Associates Degree. With that, I can transfer to a more expensive school somewhere else, because there are no public Universities closer than 2 hours away. But, Rhys has maxed out his student loans, so he can't afford to go to college right now. He is going to be working with the Red Cross for a year; he'll get a monthly stipend (for more than I make right now, which is nice) and $4500 at the end of 1 year of service, to go toward his education. Plus, his loan payments will be deferred, which he could not afford to pay otherwise.

So, I was taking this college algebra in the summer, so I could graduate and get a full-time job. I have taken summer classes every year I have been in that college, 2 classes every summer. I never had any problems keeping up with the faster pace, because it's only Community College and anyone can pass. 

But my instructor was an asshole, and I was getting anxiety attacks in class, so I was advised to drop the class for the benefit of my emotional health. I got a full refund even though I was 3 weeks into the class, so it's like I did not take the class! But, I still have to take a math class this fall, so I think i'm going to take it online, so I don't have to deal with anyone in person. 

I got an anxiety attack while trying to register for the class, but I think it's due to stress. I need to chill! I hope things get better now that Rhys has finished his class and he won't have to worry about homework and paper deadlines. And I think I might be able to get a full-time job soon at the library, so we might be able to afford our own place, which will greatly reduce my stress and raise my comfort level.

I'm going to go make some lunch now..."

"event","Hello people of the webiverse! I have decided to keep an on-line journal. Why?...I have no idea. Maybe I can brag about how cute my daughter is. Or, I can write about whoever pissed me off that day. I don't know. I'll se what I feel like writing.

Today, I am doing dishes, only because we have used them all and I haven't cleaned them in a week. I just finished the first load and I am taking a break. Rhys is playing Battlefield Vietnam with some of his friends. Bronwyn is stepping all over me, so i better get back to the dishes. And then, I have to figure out what to cook! Yea, me!

So, i'll figure out how to use this thing and post some pictures of Bronwyn this week. Peace!"

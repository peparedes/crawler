"event","okay now completely inspired.<3

I felt so bad about saturday when Logan was mean to me. but he reassuered me just by the way he talked about our relationship. it means something. everything. supposed to be. i wasnt gonna let it happen. perfect. I find every last imperfection Perfect. Sandalwood. I feel so safe wraped in his arms. and I feel like I mean something with him wraped in mine. It gives me purpose. and theres every need for hope. Its not yet complete. sometimes blinded but always there. the best part is. He  might just feel exactly the same.

Kenny""no i wouldnt be sleeping.""

Kenny""yeah but he is really tired.""
me""is it me?""
Kenny""dont think that. He loves you.""
me""ok but if its me tell me.""
Kenny""for sure.""

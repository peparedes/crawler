"event","hands reaching out,
thousands upon thousands encircling me.
fear confusion engulfing my body
what to do, which to grab,which not to.
hands of flesh,hands of bone.
hands decorated in jewels,
hands decorated in scars.
feeling my skin, tearing it
healing it,worshiping it.
pain and love
sorrow and joy.
eyes closed i reach out
my fingers enclosing over warmth.
pulsing with hate,with love
gloving with the fire of lust.
i pull twards me as the hands recede,
back to the darkness,the unknown.
a face apears and a smile is shown.
our lips touch for but a second,
our souls aflame with desire.
then you burst into flames.
screams so loud they shattger glass.
the tears come as you reach out to me.
i reach back as you turn to ash.
out of the darkness the hands return,
more now with death and pain.
the wind picks up to blow away another pile of ash.
the words ""i love you"" float on the wind as my tears return.
again i must choose which hands to hold,
wich soul to burn.
back again to a false love.
back again to reality."

"event","hey pete.todays just one o' those days where it all hits you.im not depressed but im not happy either.well im not goin to jail cause my lawyer got court appointed so got to deal with that longer.my two friends who have been together for 4 years are expecting a little boy in 5 months and that is really cool cause i get to go to the baby shower,i know its a girly thing but it will be fun.it's just with all this good stuff happening i dont have anyone special to share it with.well everyone says i could with cassie but i can't stand her anymore.we have grown really far apart.from friends to lovers to best friends to people who cant stand each other. she is to much of a lil' kid still and i think the accident made me grow up alot more that she has.i cant stand to even hear her name these days cause i know that she is just throwing her life away.i know in time i will find someone but right now it is so hard to be all alone.i have my friends yeah but you cant cuddle with friends,and thats just not the type o' guy i am anyway.truthfully i guess you can say i miss brittney.i saw her at the movies yesterday and did she look good.that brought all those feelings back,it always does.unfortunately with me the problem is that i dont hang around with any one anymore cause well either they dont call or i just dont want to be round them,so it's not like i can meet new people.pluss lol im a cold son o' a bitch now too, not the always smiling happy go lucky tony i used to be.well there are a few gals out ther i can see myself with not many(like 2)but it always just takes time.see ya'll latter.thanks pete."

a challenge? When life gives <i>you</i> lemons you<br>not only make lemonade, you
make lemon meringue pie to go along with it. When<br>things are at their worst, you
are at your best. You thrive in conflict and more<br>worried when things are going
well. To this end you tend to make things harder on<br>yourself than they have to
be. You can become over-confident at times. Be<br>careful not to bite off more than
you can chew or you'll bury yourself. You probably<br>have trouble accepting the
help of other people, needing the satisfaction that<br>you not only can, but must
do everything yourself. This just isn't true, it's<br>good to be independent and
self-reliant as you are, but it takes an even<br>greater amount of strength to
admit when you need help and sometimes even you<br>need help. You take charge of
the bad situations with no problem and people know<br>that you are the one to get
them through it. But when things are going your<br>way, you aren't sure what to do
and tend to just do what others want to , all the<br>while searching for that hard
road again. Things don't always have to be hard,<br>you don't have to always
face the tough days on your own and you can decide<br>what you want for the good
days. Find that strength in humility we know is<br>there and let someone know when
you need help and take that easy road every once in<br>awhile. Give yourself the
break you deserve.</font></p>

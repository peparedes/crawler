"event","attention friends! I'm migrating to blogger. Dunno exactly why, but I am. The address is:<br /><br /><br />http://wonderingchew.blogspot.com/<br /><br />I may post updates here too for awhile, I dunno. At any rate, here's a copy of what I just wrote: <br /><br /><h3 class=""post-title"">                          <a href=""http://wonderingchew.blogspot.com/2007/05/first-post.html"">the first post!</a>                      </h3>                        <p>Well, I guess this is as good a time to start up my new blog as any...I've just moved up to Sandpoint, ID for the summer leg of my AmeriCorps placement, as of last Tuesday when I arrived, met with my supervisor and got my trailer set up. Yep, living in a trailer in Idaho on the banks of the Pend O'Reille River...not bad right? Some people build multimillion dollar lodges, condos and cabins on lakefront property...me, I hook up with Idaho Fish and Game and get a trailer with a boat dock and huge lawn, not to mention the nature trail on the other side of the road.<br /><br />Realized yesterday, once all the hullaballoo of meeting various people to know was over and I was pretty much on my own all day, that this is definitely the most alone I've been...maybe ever? Definitely all year. It's going to take some getting used to, but I think it'll be a pretty useful side-effect of being up here. Can't always be surrounded by friends, right? Hopefully after not too long I'll be able to flip the switch into ""alone"" mode and get by fine.<br /><br /><br />Not feeling particularly profound at the moment, so I think this I'll just wrap up this post by saying that i'm super excited for the work I'll be doing this summer, it'll be a challenge but definitely one worth undertaking. And, seeing as I'm going to have plenty of time on my hands when not working, look for more posts soon!</p>"

"event","Well I'm up here at the condo with sis without much to do cause she's boring (phd work always) and you can't ski at night. Well, you can, when there's nightskiing, but that's different. And nightskiing never happens this late in the night. Anyway, I was looking at my friend's page, and then I accidentally hit ""post"" and it brought me here. So I figured ""hey, got nothing better to do, might as well post."" 

Let's see, what the heck has happened in my life since I last posted? Well, just before thanksgiving I finished the fall residency portion of my year, and received a Graduate Certificate in Environmental Education, which means I'm now a para-professional, which is nice. I had a week off for thanksgiving, got to spend time with the fam and with mags and emmy and fam, and got to go skiing with sis and pop, which was also nice. Then went back down to McCall for three weeks of winter training, during which--in addition, of course, to getting trained and building our winter curriculum--I finally met a couple dating prospects plus more hangout buddies in the form of McCall locals, and got promoted to 2nd degree black belt. All that was also quite nice. 

Last saturday night was The Cocktail Party, which, according to ""Shaq,"" a ~5""2' very round asian guy who seems to know everybody in mccall, is one of two times during the entire year that you'll see people dressed up in mccall. The other time is the inevitable wedding that happens to somebody (well, two people) every summer. I was in near top form that night, and met many many many locals which was awesome because I'm sure to run into many of them again since mccall is, after all, only so big. I met two LC grads--Matt and Elaine--from 1993 (same high school I went to) who were ecstatic and dumbstruck to meet a fellow LC grad--they were hosting the cocktail party, but I didn't know them before, just knew a couple people who filled me in on the party scoop. I met a cute girl named Chenoa (sp?) who digs superman, music, and spends her summers working on the family ranch, almost entirely self-sufficient and located in the remote Frank Church Wilderness (also in Idaho, but far far away). Angela has been out of school for I think 3 years now, and is working in Real Estate, and while she and her husband and in the process of building a new house, she doesn't think she'll ultimately spend her life in McCall. Shaq, like I said, knows everybody, and loves to introduce people (i.e.""hey have you met Josh??"") so he's a great guy to know at a party. Audrey I had met a few weeks ago, and last summer was her rookie Smokejumper season...hott. She's hoping to get hired on for this coming summer at the McCall smokejumping base, one of the better ones apparently. We're hoping to get some skiing/boarding in together at Brundage after I return from the holiday break. 

Sunday I stopped off at Thai Taste restaurant in Lewiston to grab some dinner along my drive up to Spokane, whereupon entering I ran into a couple whose son, Kyle, had been one of my students at MOSS! He had broken his arm, so both parents had been at MOSS at various points to help out, which is why I'd met them before (and not just kyle). Well, they thanked me for teaching Kyle and such, kind of the usual but always appreciated gestures, and I asked them to say hello to Kyle for me. So we went and ate at our separate tables, and they left before me and waved goodbye. And then when the waitress came to clear my table, she informed me that ""the couple sitting over there paid for your dinner tonight."" !!! Isn't that sweet? I was very touched. 

After dinner I continued uneventfully back up to Spokane, crashed, and then drove up monday morning with mom to go skiing. My sis joined us today, making it the second day of sunny skies and FAST hardpack. Tomorrow we'll be taking a private telemark lesson, our mom's hanukah gift for us. Sweet huh? 

Pretty much, life is good."

"event","So, despite my best intentions to post regularly about life here at MOSS, I haven't posted in, oh, about two months...oops. Well, can't do much about that now, so I'll work on rectifying that situation...but no promises:-)<br /><br />*warning: coming back up to the top having completed this post, it's ridiculously long. Therefore, I'm going to put in an LJ cut so it doesn't take up ridiculous amounts of space on anyone's friends page, cause I hate that. So, if you're really interested, you can read this post in it's entirety:<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Here you go"">Life here in McCall is maaaaad busy, but good!&nbsp; believe wer'e about to head into week 8 (of 10 teaching weeks for the fall portion), and I have quite a bit on my plate. My basic two-week schedule, starting with teaching weeks:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Monday</strong>: get to start at 10 am, prep for the arrival of the kids, teach until about 830 pm.&nbsp;<br /><strong>tues</strong>: start with 7:15&nbsp;am field instructor meeting, then get the kids all day for&nbsp;either terrestrial day or hydrology day, teaching in the field, free around 6pm when dinner's over<br /><strong>wed</strong>: same as tuesday, except flipside (ie half of us teach terrestrial first, half hydrology, and then switch on wednesday). start at 715 am, done at 6 pm<br /><strong>thurs</strong>: start at 715 am for meeting, but today we facilitate the kids in a scientific inquiry project that uses the scientific method to come up with a question, hypothesis, and methods to research the answer, and then we go out into the field, do the research, and then finish up with analyzing our data, conclusions, and making a poster to present with. It's great to see the kids apply what they've been learning, and some groups require just a little guidance while others need you to pretty much tell them what they're question is while tactfully presenting it in a way so that they think they came up with it all by themselves:-)&nbsp;Then, after dinner, lead the goodbye campfire--ie thank you sticks (what you're thankful for from the week) and then s'mores + skits and songs. Lots of fun!<br /><strong>fri: </strong>715 am meeting again, then after breakfast all the groups present their inquiry project, then we wrap up the week and send the kids off on the bus. After that, cleaning everything up and debriefing the week, usually done around 3-4 pm.&nbsp;<br /><br />Academic Week:&nbsp;<br />pretty much class from 830 am - 430 pm every day.&nbsp;Much of it out in the field, and all excellent courses, but by 430 we're damn tired. What classes am I taking you might ask? <br />advanced teaching methods for environmental educators with KB (Karla Bradley)<br />community ecology with EC (Eric Carpenter)<br />outdoor leadership with GT (Gary Thompson) <br /><br />for which I'll receive at the end of the semester a graduate-level certificate in environmental education. Pretty sweet huh?&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, now I'm looking back and wondering why I thought it necessary to post in such detail what I do every day on a two week rotation...I think my point was that we're ridiculously busy, because somewhere in there we have homework, and quite a bit of it. I was just reading Mara's blog, about never having any time for homework during the week and having to crunch it all in on the weekends...and I know exactly how that feels. During teaching week I'm so exhausted at the end of the day that I'm pretty useless when it comes to homework, which means I have evenings during academic week and weekends to get all my work done. I was thinking about how in college I mostly loaded up my classes btwn about 10-1 or so, which meant that I could then go home, take a break to eat lunch, and then my prime homework times were from about 230-530, and 8-11...what this means now, though, is that during my first block of productivity I'm still mostly in class,&nbsp;and then by the time my second wind would normally come about, I'm exhausted and it's time for bed...<br />So my big challenge has been readjusting the entirety of my work habits. It's been tricky because for the past 5 weeks or so I've had a weekend taken out of that two week rotation--first for rosh hashanah when I went home, and was in schul all day or driving to and from mccall (it's about 5 hour drive to spokane), then the next weekend I was set back 6 hours because I went down to boise for kol nidre, and then a week later my parents were visiting, so not much homework done that weekend...so I had to squeeze two weekends of homework time into one twice in a row...not so much fun, and I got way behind on both work and sleep.&nbsp;<br />Well, the good news is that I'm now pretty much caught up on both. Last monday, as a result from the combination of being exhausted, behind, and then going over everything that will be due in the next month in class, I was, well, a little overwhelmed. I left class and said to myself ""wow, I need to reorganize my entire life."" so step one was cleaning up my side of the yurt, which had gotten a bit, um, scattered, and then my desk, because I couldn't start organizing all the work I needed to do when everything was piled under a foot of papers, books and folders. So, did that, got caught up on my work, and yesterday took some time to get everything I need to do in the next month all organized in one place (my computer, actually...ical is a wonderful thing). Today was quite productive, and I got in a good amount of homework, a short but good workout, and even a bit of R&amp;R. Nice. Tomorrow I'm going to get up early, canoe down the peninsula to my phenology site in the state park, do some work there, and then hopefully canoe back, go on a run, eat lunch, and head to the coffee shop in donnelly to a) get lots of work done, including lesson plans for the week and b) pick up my mug that I left there accidentally last weekend.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I've rambled on for way too long already, but I just now remembered that I was going to include part of the incentive for getting organized. To echo a sentiment that a classmate of mine mentioned in our leadership class on friday, I've always known that I never worked to my full potential in college. I made decent grades and got my work done, but I was always scrambling at the last minute and turning in work that wasn't bad, and some of it very good, but rarely was it my actually my best. Well, that's all good and fine, and what're you gonna do about it right? It's in the past. But I can change that now, and I want to. I've mentioned often that right now I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing. No more of the anticipatory feeling that I'm just prepping for the future (not that this isn't a stepping stone,&nbsp;but much different). It's remarkably satisfying feeling like you've actually started your life, and the life that you'll more or less be doing for, well, the rest of your life. Um, hopefully that made sense. How that relates to my coursework, though, is that sure, I could ""get by."" I could scramble, pull several late nights, starve myself of sleep, and get something turned in. (representative of our entire semester-long progression of teaching, leadership, and learning is our portfolio, which includes any combination of bits and piece from teaching and courses throughout the semester that shows that progression; and our phenology project, which studies one place and how it changes throughout the course of 4 months, both in a place-based education sense for teaching methods, and secondarily with a more scientific element with transects, plant ID, data collection and such) So yea, I could hash something together, get it turned in, get my certificate and move on to the next portion of our year, which is outreach in the spring.&nbsp;<br />But this is my life. And the first step of many. I want to start out right. I want to look back on this year, on the projects I did, and the teaching experience I received, and be able to say that I truly gave it my best. That I worked my ass off, but not only worked hard--I worked smart, efficiently. Part of that is getting enough rest, and getting enouch exercise to be on my best while I'm teaching and in classes. But the other part is dedicating myself to turning out work that really shows both my instructors and myself what I'm capable of, because I now I'm capable of a lot more than most of what I turned in in college. I think of some of my best papers that I wrote, and there's a few that are damn good pieces of work. But then I think ""wow, what id I had started those 3 days in advance instead of 12 hours before they were due?"" Or some similar extension of that--starting well ahead of schedule, rather than last minute, and giving myself time to complete my work in a relaxed fashion so that I'm not rushing to finish it 15 minutes before it's due with no time to even look over my work sometimes?&nbsp;<br />My point is that I can do this, and I feel like I'm finally ready to. I've told myself I needed to do this for a long time. But there's no excuses now. I think part of why I'm allowing myself to write such a ridiculously long post is so that I hold myself accountable not just by knowing what I should do, but by throwing it out into the public sphere. Now it's in writing. Now (theoretically at least, I'm not sure anybody will get this far...kudos if you're still reading!) friends of mine have read these changes I'm supposedly making, and the fact they other people are reading my thoughts and decisions give them a weight different than that which remains when it's only internal. So, yes. I'm now done, and, speaking of rest, it's time for bed. Long day ahead of me tomorrow :-)&nbsp;</div><br />"

"event","Wow so after 17 straight days of MOSS training, we're officially trained, and have the 3 day weekend off! So I thought I should post an update on life. 
Things are going REALLY well. First of all, this place is absolutely gorgeous. The field campus (sidenote: I'm working for the McCall Outdoor Science School, in McCall, ID. The facility we use is actually the Univ. of Idaho Field Campus) is located on Payette Lake, about a 3 minute drive from town, or a 6-8 minute bike ride. It sometimes gets pretty warm during the day, but without fail it's COLD cold cold at night--the last few nights it's gotten down into the 30s. And since I live in a yurt, and both of us are too stubborn to turn the heat on since it's august--well, now september, but that's just today--we're both freezing by wake-up time. I've been wearing a hat to bed, which feels kinda silly, because I never used to...but hey so it goes. 
The reason it gets so cold is because we're at ~5,000 ft elevation, right in the middle of the Payette National Forest. The weather here is kind of crazy--we'll have blue, sunny skies and then a thunder storm will roll in out of nowhere, and have passed completely in 20 or 30 minutes. 

There are also killer pine cones here. I've struggled, in previous attempts, to describe these pine cones in a manner which will convey their true lethal quality. During our tour the first day (almost three weeks ago...crazy), while walking by the parking lot, our instructors suggested we not park our cars under the ponderosas, because the pine cones have shattered windshields in the past. At the time we laughed...but our laughter soon turned into a healthy fear as we witnessed their awesome power. A couple days ago, a smaller pine cone did this to a chair on the dining lodge deck: 
http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5119/3051/1600/IMG_0228.jpg
Frightening.

Hopefully now you understand why I actually wore my bike helmet during a session of our Wilderness First Aid course last weekend, while we were sitting under one of those ponderosa pines. As the pine cones fell, other people savvied up, and held their foam sitting cushions over their heads--good thing too! Because not five minutes later, one of our instructors was struck by a cone, which plummeted down from above, smashing into his foam pad before careening off towards M.Cat's head, which was luckily also foam-protected. Poor M.Cat (mary catherine is her real name) rose to her feet to recover from her shock, only to be struck in the side 30 seconds later by another cone which had bounced off the ground. I'm telling ya'll, these things are dangerous. The squirrels have it in for us. 

So now that I've rambled on about pine cones, just a brief note on what else we've been doing. I'll have to do this quickly because a few of us are leaving soon to ride into town. Today we had our first session of AmeriCorps orientation. We finished about 45 minutes ago, and are now freeeeeee until tuesday morning. We haven't had a day off since arriving august 14. They've been good about trying to give us our evenings off after dinner, and a few blocks of time in the afternoons some days, but boy are we glad to get this weekend to play. One of our fellow peeps is actually getting married tomorrow up in Moscow (Idaho) so several of us are heading up tomorrow for that, and then we're gonna try to play on the water (rafting or canoeing hopefully) on sunday and/or monday before it gets too cold for water. 

Mainly our training has been learning/mastering critical content that we'll be teaching the kids who come up here for the week, mainly 5th and 6th graders. The bulk of it is a Terrestrial day, a hydrology day, and in inquiry day in which we facilitate a scientific inquiry in which our kids come up with a question, hypothesis, methods and then data collection and analysis. All of this is under the guise of Earth Systems Science (ESS) which focuses on the interactions between things--in biomes, ecosystems and habitats and involving individuals, populations and communites of living things. We talk about the spheres--biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere, as well as the new ""technosphere""--and how interactions between them affect the world around us. All the content is shaped to fit perfectly alongside the science curriculum they're learning in school (mandated by the state)--so the idea is that they get to experience the content firsthand and hands on here, and then when they talk about it at school they have this experience to reference. 

Alright I think that's quite enough for this update. Our first kids come next wednesday! We'll be team teaching next week (just a 3 day week; the norm will be 5) and then after that we're on our own with groups of 8-10 kids. I'm about halfway done with my lesson plans, so I'll be finishing those up over the weekend, as well as Tuesday, which we have together to get all the final things ready for our first group...wish me/us luck!!"

"event","k I just gotta post about this, because, well, I just gotta...I have a really hard time falling asleep at night when I'm too warm; and yet, when it's too warm at other times (eg in class) I find myself having a very difficult time staying awake...so whose bloody idea of a joke is that??? If it was either one way or the other, I could deal. If being kept up occasionally at night by warmth meant warmth in the class kept me awake, or warmth put me to sleep in class but also helped me sleep at night, either would be a worthwhile draw. <em><strong>This</strong></em>, however, <strong><em>this</em></strong> is just cruel and unusual. <br /><br />Oh, and <em><strong>this</strong></em> being in the context of trying to go to sleep for the last two hours, and needing to get up in 2.5 more to be at work at 3 am...because I have to deliver pies for cyrus o'leary's...because I need to make money, and I'm temping right now as a start...because I got fired from camp...because I drank one goddamn beer at the wrong time and wrong place...granted, it's my own damn fault, but I think I have somewhat the right to bitch just a little bit, no?<br /><br />ok back to (attempting) sleep"

"event","So last night I went to my friend Sharon's senior viola recital. She's one of my best music pals, we've played in orchestra together for years now plus some chamber music, and she's a fantastic musician, and the recital was a delight. In particular I was really struck by the final movement of her final piece, a shostakovich sonata. So get this: it's my last musical event at brandeis, and it's my good friend playing this piece, her last performance here ever. And the sonata was the last piece shostakovich ever wrote. And the final movement of his piece is an adagio (slow) in which he pays tribute to Beethoven (another of my favorites) by using pieces of beethoven's (famous) moonlight sonata throughout the movement. It's this incredibly beautiful, poignant elegy, and literally almost brought me to tears, especially when I started thinking about the piece itself in relation to what was going on in my own life. I was numb by the final note, just sitting there completely taken in. It was both a great moment and quite sad . . . bittersweet, a word I think I'm going to be using an awful lot these next couple weeks..."

WOOOHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

I'll be letting them know by the end of next week whether I accept the offer or not, but I'm almost positive I'm going to do it. 

It's an americorp-affiliated program that combines three segments--a graduate semester program in which we teach 5th-6th graders environmental shizz, ecology, that kinda thing (in the fall) at the McCall field campus (in the beautiful mountains), and then in the spring we head out to various elementary schools around the state to implement our env. ed. curriculum in the classrooms and such there. Then, in the summer, we're each individually placed in what's essentially an internship with some sort of non-profit org, government agency or some other sort of environmentally-related position. This program is perfect for me. 

Oh and Brundage ski resort is in McCall. Booya."

The Lotus flower in the center represent spirituality in movement (lotus is also the name of the thai martial arts style I do) and in several eastern religions/cultures represents rebirth, growth and enlightenment.

So I just completed my FIRST post-college interview EVER, literally five minutes ago. It was a phone interview with the McCall Outdoor Science School for an awesome program they've just developed that is 12 months long, starting in mid-august. It's at the top of my list, right up with the NW Youth Corps' Outdoor School (an alternative high school), for AmeriCorps positions I would really love to get. Holy shit. So they say interviews normally last around 20 or 30 minutes...this one was an hour long! That's an awfully long time to be answering questions that determine your entire future. One of the interiewers mentioned towards the end that by the way the tally of questions was 18. 18 questions. Hey 18 is Chai (hebrew word for Life)...so that's a good sign right? 
Anyway I got off the phone and just like collapsed, except I had to stand up instead of falling down, but the same kind of feeling. Take a deep breath, let it out. that kind of just holy shit i'm glad that's over feeling. Of course my very first interview has to be with one of the positions I want the most. Although last night a guy from a different org. called to ask a few questions, so that was like a short informal interview I guess, but this was definitely the first big one. Looks like I might have another phone interview tomorrow or thursday with the San Jose Conservation Corps. Yikes. 
Anyway, I think it went alright at least. I wasn't my most eloquent, but I feel like I gave some good answers and represented myself decently well. Let me tell you, it is MAD nerve wracking when someone is asking you a question (via speakerphone) and you couldn't quite understand it. For one I went ahead and asked them to repeat the question, but there were a couple others where I got the jist of the question but was kind of like oh g-d I hope I'm answering the right question right now. 

I am so glad I consulted our Career Center's interview page. I can't imagine what I would have done if I hadn't! I wouldn't have been prepared at all! This way I had some answers already thought up that even if they didn't exactly match some of the questions they were easy to modify so that they did. There were one or two questions that really made me stop for a second and be like um. shit. think fast! 

ok I think my heartbeat is getting a little closer to normal...i'm gonna go...uh...I dunno, do something else. 
goodbye!"

"event","So there's this article I read recently in natl. geographic Adventure magazine (march 2006) that I keep coming back to because it really touched me, and I thought I'd excerpt part of it here. It's by a guide in the southwest, and this particular part recounts a trip he worked for with some Japanese businessmen. It just really highlights how different our worlds can all be, and is the kind of outdoor experience that really touches me.

<lj-cut text=""here it is"">

""That first summer in southern utah, I was a crew member on what must have been the most extravagant white-water trip in history. The client was a Japenese owner of a cosmetics firm, and he'd brought an entourage of 12 to run Cataract Canyon on the Colorado River. Included were four comely Japanese women who were either fashion models, or geisha, or both . . . on the final night, after dinner, the girls tugged their boss--a respectable and conservative 53-year-old businessman--and his friends into one of the tents. Forty-five minutes later the men emerged as full-on drag queens: silky kimonos, luscious wigs, caked-on rouge, beauty marks, and ruby red lips . . . they sang and danced and howled. I watched their shadows from the firelight flutter on the cliffs; the canyon walls rose up on all sides, jagged black outlines against a moonless night, an explosion of stars filling the sky. 
Suddenly the laughter stopped. The Japanese cocked their heads back and began whispering. The boss rose from his lawn chair, pulled off his wig and stood by the fire, gazing skyward. ""He's never seen the Milky Way,"" the translator told me. I looked up again, and there it was: The brilliant shimmering fog spread across the cosmos. Out in the darkness the river surged over rocks; its roar filled the canyon. 
And then the man began to weep. He stared up at heaaven, and we heard his sobs. The mascara ran down his cheeks, and he gathered a fold in the kimono to wipe his eyes. the campfire burned down to embers and no one threw on another log. One by one the partyers pulled themselves out of the sand and crept to their tents...""

"event","heyyyyyy so seems like a good time for an update, cause it's been awhile! Don't have any particular theme to this entry, soooooo it's like a suprise bag, I don't even know myself what awaits inside! 
So this past weekend was my last ever McBrine Division Ski race weekend...and I'm really a bit sad! Every year I get to know other people in the division better, and despite being from all these different schools and competing against each other, it's really such an awesome and fun community. Everyone is there to have a good time, even the good racers; and within the top 6-10 racers there's this little sub-community that it's been really fun to be a part of. It's kind of that once you've started finishing up high in the rankings consistently, people start to notice, and I started getting noticed for real sophomore year when I laid down a sweet run to finish 4th place overall. Last year was a bit weird because I could only race saturdays (sundays I had my EMT class), but this entire year I've been at every race, and at the end of the run it's sweet to shoot around with the other guys (from Yale, Castleton, Marist, Wesleyan, etc) being like hey man, nice run! or how'd it go? clicking poles together, all that fun comeraderie shizz, know what I'm saying? And people throughout the division this year actually know me by name (hey it's Yoshi! We see you and your pony tail and love it!) so yea, I'm definitely gonna miss it. Thanks McBrine, it's been an awesome time. 
But! It's not quite my last college race because...our girls' team made regionals, and I qualified as the top individual (not on a team already going) so I get to compete as well! So that's in a couple weeks, and I'm mad psyched. 

Ok let's see, what else...I feel like there's this one thing I should at least reference. Basically a final decision made last night, not in my favor...which sucks. I don't really feel like going into any details. But I'm definitely bummed, because it could have been really good.

hah ok that was cryptic. feel free to ask if you want more details. whatevs. Oh yea and ski team has finally done me in--in that I'm a bit sick today. But it's beautiful sun and blue skies, so what can I really complain about? 

Final semester senior year...I feel like now that ski team is almost over, it's really the truly final stretch. Which is definitely good! But also hella weird. You spend so much time here, building so many different paths and relationships, and then you find yourself in this spot now of looking ahead and having to consider which you want to retain/follow next year and which you're going to have to leave behind. I guess that's kind of a stark way of putting it, but it's true. Ooh, speaking of, I def need to finish up my NW Youth Corps application today. It's due wednesday. yikes. I'm such a procrastinator. It's not like I haven't had time (with the exeption of weekends, which are completely useless work-wise due to ski team) because I'm only taking 3.5 classes. Mon and Wed I have no class until 5, thurs I have nothing except orchestra at night, and then Tu Fri I have class 1030-130. So really a pretty sweet schedule. 

Alright I think I've rambled enough. I think I'm going to go whip up some lunch. Yum."

"event","Somebody slap me the next time I forget the distinction between ""loving"" someone and being ""in love"" with someone...because sometimes there is a difference, a big difference, and I haven't been recognizing it lately. 

...There, glad to get that off my chest. Lots of work this week eh? Oh yea, plenty. Waiting for my tea to cool, getting a little hungry...anybody who hasn't read Anna Karenina and is looking for a novel that will affect you deeply and powerfully if you're willing to invest a little bit of energy in the process...pick up a copy. Please. I promise, you won't regret it. 
In case you were wondering, I'm writing my term paper for Chinese Thought on the novel (well, on what chinese thinkers would have to say about it anyway), so lately I've been delving back into Tolstoy's world, and both remembering how deeply it affected me when I read it two years ago and on how just those two additional years of life, experience and emotion, greatly affects the novel's influence over me now. In these past two years, I've loved more deeply, experienced far greater pain and sorrow, been to places remote and familiar...ie I've lived more. It just makes you realize that no matter how intelligent and wise you think you are, at any stage of life, it really is true that some things only develop with time, because it's only after you've personally experienced more of life that you can better appreciate the subtle intricacies of being human. 
And hell, I'm a whoppin' 22 years old. I can't even imagine how different my perspective will be in ten years...twenty...fifty...sometimes I'm awestruck by how much a person has been through in their life. My grandfather Jimmie was 90 when he died. That was also two years ago. Born in 1913 deep into Cantonese China, he moved to the states when he was 13, lived through the depression, fought in WWII at Omaha Beach on D-Day, helped rebuild Europe after the war, fought in the Korean War, opened two restaurants in France, was married...then decided to move back to the states, had to leave his wife because she wouldn't come with him...and met my grandmother, single mother of three children (including my mom), and married her and her family...all well before I even came into this world, he had this incredible lifetime of experiences. He liked to tell people that he had been to some 20 graduations throughout the years...high school, college, grad school...for his children, his grandchildren. He won't be at my college graduation in May, not physically anyway, but his spirit will be with me. 90 years of living in this world. Damn."

How could I so easily forget what I had been working towards for such a long time? How could I let myself be so naive and selfish? 
It's so bloody frustrating. I'd like to just do something completely right for once, and stop making these aggravating mistakes that push me/us ten steps backward. To stop worrying so much about what everything means, and just be. 
To just be.

One, if you're going to insult somebody, don't do it anonymously. Have the balls to write your name. Honestly. 
Two, if somebody's lj bothers you that much, the solution is easy: don't read it! Just say no! Does it really bother you to such a base level of fury that you can't help but splay your emotional immaturity in an anonymous exposition of baseless accusation and pointless raging? 
I just don't get it. 

Anyway, good news: I am FOREVER done with co-sci. Took the final this morning, think I might have done decently (but only because he tends to grade the exams fairly liberally, not because I actually knew what I was doing) ...so we'll see. But it feels good. Really good. 

I still have SO much work left to do in the next week. No need to list it all here (that would be another self-absorbed session of wallowing in self-pity, wouldn't it, oh you accrid anonymous animals), but to say the least, it's gonna suck. 

I CANNOT WAIT to go skiing! I know I know i've said it many times, but I'm excited ok? And I can't wait to be back home in Spokane, see my family, my pseudo family, hang out with good friends who I haven't seen in awhile and miss like WHOA...yknow, good times in spokadilly.

"event","Hey so remember that one time when I was told I had a job then they didn't show up the next day when they were supposed to, said they'd call. And then how the next day after that, they called while I was on my way to class to tell me they decided they couldn't use me since I can only work 4 hours a day while I'm taking this class? That was fun. 
Now looking for another job...

On a brighter note, I've been home from my NOLS trip for a couple weeks now. Being home is fun. I definitely miss being out in the wild though, and miss my awesome awesome group. And eating ten thousand calories a day and still losing weight cause your metabolism has skyrocketed. Yea NOLS was amazing. Flat out. Amazing. One of the best times I've ever had, learning so much in a single day about the outdoors, about surviving, about your abilities, your endurance, strengths and weaknesses. Truly an unforgettable experience. I can't wait to get back out. 
But being home hasn't been as much of a letdown as I was worried it might. I'm super-enjoying my environmental science class. My prof is a crazy eccentric british guy who's a real kick, and for labs we actually get to get outside and use gps units to track water caches, locate waypoints, etc. Way cooler than any of the labs we did in chemistry. 
I'm also volunteering at Deaconess in the ER, which has been alright, not that exciting. Maybe I should try and change my shift to a different time. Not much happens in Spokane on Monday nights that gets people sent to the ER I guess. 
Getting my grandma's house ready to be painted too. Been powerwashing, scraping, etc. It's nice to be outside. And that's about all I have to say at the moment I suppose. Not a particularly introspective entry, but an update nonetheless. Ciao!"

"event","I've been home now since Friday night, and have just been loving it. My passover seders were wonderful, especially the first night, as we got together with the ""extended family,"" that being mine, the finer-berings and the goldberg/yates, and more of us were there this year than have been together for quite a long time. So it was just great to reminisce, to chat, catch up, poke fun at the seder all while truly enjoying it and being together. 
I've also been getting out to run along the roads by my house, and it is just magnificent out here. So green, with rolling hills and small valleys along the roads where I run, and everything in bloom so it smells ridiculously good. And such great weather. It feels great to be outside, breathing such clean air (especially compared to boston) and being in the midst of such natural beauty. To quote a friend, I am truly blessed to live where I do. 
I also spent some time at Kelsi's house this afternoon. We had a lot to talk about, or at least I did; just felt like I needed to get everything out in person, and it went really well. I was nervous, but I think I said most of what I needed to, and I feel really good about where we're at now. Plus, we went out on the dock for a bit, sitting and soaking up the sun on her lake while her dog kept looking for shade. Haha oh poor Andy. Talk about another gorgeous place though. Especially with the warm sun and so much greenery as it's reaching the high point of spring right now. I think between the two of us we live in just about the best places the inland northwest has to offer. Oh and, btw, Romeo is HUGE. Just thought I'd throw that in. But yea, I feel really good about everything now, and I'm really looking forward to spending more time out there this summer...and finishing season 3 (and hopefully 4) of Smallville too, hehe. 
Ariel's in town too, with his fiance, so it's been fun to hang out with them and catch up, and we'll be doing plenty more of that the rest of this week! I guess somewhere in there I should start studying too...sigh. Anyway, it's looking like it'll be an early morning tomorrow, so off to bed I go. Goodnight Moon (which, surprise surprise, has been beautiful every night:-) )
Oh yea, went to REI this evening with mum, to get outfitted for my NOLS trip, fill in the gaps for any clothing and gear I needed. We have a few things left, but got most of our list. So, I'm pretty much set for outdoors clothing for a good thirty years...nice."

"event","Had my state EMT practical exam today, went really well! They kept us moving at a pretty good pace so there wasn't too much waiting around, and I felt pretty confident on all the stations, so I'm pretty pumped! All I have left now is waiting to receive the letter confirming that I passed (or that I failed) and then heading downtown to take the written exam. And then I'll be an EMT! cool huh?
Plus finally did well on a chem test, granted it was easier than most but my studying (of the ass-off persuasion) definitely paid off. 
And since I got up at 645 AM today, it's definitely time for bed. 
Only one more week of classes! (and five days until I'm back in the beautiful northwest for Passover break!)"

"event","Just watched the Oscars, it was actually really quite well done! For one, they really streamlined the whole affair, coming in at just over three hours. Usually it's full of so much crap it's hard to sit through just to wait for the big awards at the end. Tonight though I really enjoyed seeing pretty much every component of the show, from Antonio Banderas' and Beyonce's singing (damn, now that's a gorgeous voice!) to YO YO MA (I about shat myself when he came on). Chris Rock was of course hilarious, and I really just had my faith in the Academy, well, not renewed because it wasn't so much there to start with...but let's just say I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the entire show. 
So the time posted will be 11:56, but as of now it's just past midnight, so 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY KELSI LYNN HALPERN!!!!!!!!!!

I hope it's as wonderful as everything else in Israel has been so far, and I'm sure will continue to be! 

Looks like I'm gonna come off break a little tired...didn't quite finish my work, haha, so I gotta get up a bit early. Sigh. Oh well. I'm actually excited to get back to classes, if only because this week has been so quiet. If I hadn't been getting to the gym to workout, I really would barely have left my house all week (with the exceptional side trip to Cambridge of course;-) ) so it'll actually be nice to be around more people again. Of course, let's see how excited I am when I have piles of work to do again, but eh, what can ya do? 
Oh, and someone apparently thinks I don't have a penis...well I checked in the shower earlier today, and it's still there, so, I win! ha!

Ummmm, I think that's about all. Thank you, and goodnight."

"event","Right now I'm sitting at my desk, on this beautiful morning, with the sun warming my back through my skylight. I just received an email from Kelsi about her Masada experience. Beautiful Kels, truly. I think one of the wonderful things about Judaism is that even if you weren't born Jewish, once you join the ranks, you're a part of the Jewish people, and you have full claim to the vast and powerful history of our people. Though by blood I am half-Jewish, I converted before my Bar Mitzvah. It is not as though now I am ""fully-Jewish,"" or ""100% Jewish."" I am now simply Jewish. I think one of the things that's helped the Jewish people survive for so incredible long is that being Jewish has as much to do with a state of being as it does with the kind of blood running through your veins. And once you begin to comprehend this state of being, and go through the processes of learning about Judaism and commiting yourself to a Jewish life (which is by no means either unreasonable or strictly bound or defined) you can lay claim to the rich culture, history and learning of our people, and via this act you also join the bloodlines of our people. 
Kelsi, I also agree that in a powerful sense, Masada was a victory for the Jews. True, not a victory in the sense of winning the battle, but a victory in spirit nonetheless, representative of the strength of the Jewish people--the passion for maintaining our identity and resisting assimilation--the same spirit has allowed Jews to last for so long. After all, we're still here. The Romans are not. 
I never got the chance for a pre-dawn hike up to Masada to view the sunrise. I didn't make it through enough of Pilgrimage:-) (Those of you who are there right now, watch where you have a beer!) But there are nonetheless images burned into my memory of other awe-inspiring moments, views and sights. Davening Shacharit both above Machtesh Katan and on the peak of Har Schlomo near Eilat, where one can see Israel to the North, Egypt to the southwest, Jordan and Syria to the East. The Ba'hai gardens on the face of Mount Carmel in Haifa, both in their green richness during the day and the lit splendor of the night. And this beautiful morning, as the sun warms my back through my skylight, I think back fondly of all these moments, and smile all the more deeply because I know that several of those whom I hold closest to my heart are now experiencing moments such as these."

"event","The Weekend: 

Friday, Jan 21:
4:56 PM--Depart for Howard Johnson Inn, lodging for Ascutney ski race. Est. travel time: 2-3 hours. 
    --traffic, heavy--
6:23 PM--Stop in random NH town for Monster (caffeinated beverage) and snack from Chinese restaurant. 
7:14 PM--Stop at NH State Liquor Store to pee and purchase bottle of Amaretto.
8:24 PM--Incorrectly read directions, head north on US-5.

9:34 PM--Arrive at Howard Johnson Inn.

Saturday, Jan 22: 
2:43 AM--Crawl into bed. 
4:49 AM--Deep slumber violatingly penetrated by shrieking fire alarm. Accusations against self heard. Claims denied. 
4:54 AM--Shoes and warmer clothes on, head outside (-10 Fahrenheit) to escape siren. 
4:56-5:47 AM--Shiver violently in car, which stubbornly refuses to heat up. 
5:52 AM--Having returned from the cold, siren silenced, crawl back into bed.

3:03 PM--Exit highway at Lebanon, NH, for gas. Discover Citgo has eerily been shut down (ie, large, nut-type metal objects in ground where pumps once existed; remains of station evident)
3:04-3:28 PM--Having discovered no other gas station nearby, head back to highway, caught in traffic. 
4:47 PM--Snow begins. 
5:56 PM--Arrive home in Waltham.
7:04 PM--Brush ridiculously accumulated amount of snow off car, head to grocery store, brush snow off again after buying said groceries, swing by Treetop thai to pick up ordered food, head home for dinner and a movie, homework. Chance of cancellation of EMT course next day. Await further notification.

Sunday, Jan 23: 
11:03 AM--Notified of EMT class cancellation. Return to bed. 
1:36 PM--awaken ridiculously late. 
9:20 PM--Notification of cancellation of classes and other university activities for Monday January 24th.

"event","I've been getting a couple requests to update, so updating I am, though I'm not really sure what to say. I had a fantastic break, filled with skiing and kelsi (and smallville) followed now by a rougher-than-usual transition back into classes. Kelsi's going to israel for two months, and we've decided that it's best not to be together while she's there. I know it's the right thing to do, but it's just tough, coupled with knowing I won't be seeing her until the end of April. Long time. So it's been a hard few days, but I know it'll smooth out. Gotta get back into the rhythm of school too, which is never fun. 
Classes are looking pretty good though. I'm taking the BEMCo (brandeis emergency medical corp) EMT training course this semester. It's a shitload of class hours and a lot of reading, but I've wanted to do it for a long time, so I'm really excited. It's really hard to work out my committment to ski team with it, which I feel really bad about, but I'm doing the best I can, and if I continue with this whole premed thing it's gonna be really good for me to get the training and exposure. So I guess I'll just have to take each weekend as it comes and work it out. Ugh. Sorry Ian and Julie. I'll make it up to you guys somehow, I promise. 
Anyway, that's about it for now. Gonna go put some music on and chill for a bit. Ciao. 




You got to leave me now, 
You got to go alone. 
You got to chase a dream, 
One that's all your own, 
Before it slips away. 

When you're soaring through the air,
I'll be your solid ground.
Take every chance you dare,
I'll still be there,
When you come back down."

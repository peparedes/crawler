"event","<br />So...in March I already threw away two big bags worth of crap, and gave away several boxes more. Still, I've started going through everything again, this time determined to be more ruthless than ever. The first pile I went through was my stuff left over from midd. Now, I'm not talking about books or notes or long articles which I painstakingly marked and highlighted because THOSE ARE MINE FOREVER (yes, I have problems), but all the other ephemera that you pick up during a life in college.<br /><br />I ended up throwing out...practically everything. Everything but my acceptance letter, my independent scholar acceptance letter (and essay), some notes from the dean about good grades, my convocation program, my graduation program, my yearbook, and my diploma.<br /><br />All else: orientation packets, directories, newspapers, course lists, random emails...gone. Thrown away. Quite literally, actually. I threw many of them in the general direction of my garbage can from across the room. And you know what?<br /><br /><em>It felt so good.</em><br />"

"event","<br />So, I've been reading all day. At least two of the characters smoke. And they've been smoking. A lot. But then...about the billionth time this habit was mentioned, the author described&nbsp;the filter. And then out of fucking nowhere, I remembered something from a dream last night (as you do), in which I was eating cigarettes.<br /><br />Eating them. <em>Eating</em>.<br /><br />I was seriously biting chunks off of them, bit by bit, usually starting at the filter.<br /><br /><em>What the fuck does this mean. Just. What.</em><br /><br />They tasted like ashes. And I kept eating them.<br /><br />This, to me, is the only thing that makes <em>Inception</em> unbelievable. Nothing that fucked up happens.<br /><br />I mean, it wasn't the main point of the dream or anything. It was just something I was doing at one point. The main thing that happened - though this, I'm certain, was a different dream - was that I was at work, and it looked like work, but nothing like work (as happens), and this guy asked me where something was in the store, and was confused when I told him, so I started leading him there and then for some reason I couldn't find it and we were in the mall proper but it looked nothing like a mall, except it did, it looked like what the Mall of America <em>should</em> fucking look like, with like, a giant FAO Schwarz that had rearing statues of unicorns at the entrance, and had candies of a billion different colors but <em>infinitely more amazing than the real thing</em>, better than fucking Willy Wonka, better than Diagon Alley, and stores with clothing and crystals like you can't imagine (except obviously, you can), and then we reached the end of the mall and it was this tiny, dark place with warped, black wood that was a secondhand store-cum-pawnshop, really, with a small bestubbled, bespectacled man behind the counter and there were dolls (WHY ARE DOLLS SO CREEPY?) and then to the customer I was like, &quot;Yo, gotta get back to work, I'll get in trouble,&quot; and he was like, I don't even remember, but then I go to leave and I wasn't sure I&nbsp;was going through the right door even thought it was at the end of the fucking complex, but then there were stairs and I was in a dilapidated hayloft and my brain was like UM, NO, and then there were more stairs leading outside, to the mall parking lot, and just, I don't know.<br /><br />...hurray for run-on sentences?<br /><br />I guess my point is that...even when my mind is trying to sort through the normal, every day shit of my life - like going to work and getting asked questions by stupid people - it can turn into something amazing. Also, is there a term for not-quite-lucidity? Because when I become lucid I either try to cling to the dream ridiculously or I try to force myself out of it, depending, but either way I end up awake. But I'm pretty sure I only ended up in the parking lot of the mall because my brain was like &quot;shopping center =\= old barn&quot;. A few nights ago, I was climbing up a spiral staircase and I HATE long staircases, it's one of those things where Europe and I don't get along, and suddenly the gravity shifted and I just pulled myself up by the banister, and once I reached the floor I was aiming toward, gravity reasserted itself.<br /><br />Another reason, I guess, why dreams are so much cooler.<br /><br />This episode of verbal vomit brought to you by: procrastination."

"event","<strong>Coworker #1: </strong>&quot;Sometimes I like using big words to confuse my daughter. Like yesterday, I used the word 'whimsical,' and she was like, 'Mommy, what's that'?&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Coworker #2: </strong>&quot;Hahahaha, that's funny.&quot; [Pause] &quot;What does whimsical mean again?&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Coworker #1: </strong>&quot;It means, like, beautiful. That's what I told her. She was like, &quot;What's that mean?&quot;, and I said, &quot;It means like something's beautiful'.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Coworker #2: </strong>&quot;Oh, right!&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Me: </strong>*shocked speechless*<br /><br />I wanted to say something. I mean, I really <em>really</em> wanted to say something. But there were a few things stopping me. Such as, this job is so much better than my previous job in that, like, I actually get to hold conversations with people and work with them, and I've been told more than once that my habit of correcting people is condescending/patronizing/stuck-up/stick-up-ass behavior. But mostly, it was because my mind was shouting a running commentary of WHAT THE FUCK WHIMSICAL MEANS...WHIMSICAL. IT MEANS FULL OF WHIMSY. IT IS LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND <em>WHIMSICAL</em>. WHIMSICAL IS NOT BEAUTEOUS. IT CAN BE BEAUTEOUS. BUT THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY INCLUSIVE. WHIMSICAL IS, IS *flippy hand waving* WHIMSICAL.<br /><br />It gave me new respect for people who write dictionaries, let me tell you.<br /><br />You see, I was a voracious reader as a child and not much of a talker, which means I learned most of my vocabulary through context. Therefore, my definitions for most words with more than one syllable involve a lot of handwaving and physical qualifiers, like the above &quot;light and fluffy,&quot; because that is the word's texture, perhaps with a playful breeze mixed in. And if it were to be written in old-timey calligraphy, the letters would be thin and airy. And if one were to give the word 'whimsical' a hue, it would be a certain shade of purple I cannot describe because I've never actually&nbsp;studied color.<br /><br />Hey, I never said it would make sense to the world. Just to me.<br /><br />In short, I'm not the most intelligent person in the world, but sometimes the ignorance of my peers <em>astounds me</em>.<br /><br />Should I have said something? :\"

"event","So....Google is my homepage. Not gonna lie. One of my favorite things when my browser starts up is to see if Google has something fancy schmancy going on. And today I said to myself, &quot;Surely there will be something wonderful for St. Patrick's Day!&quot;

But no.

Normal logo.

google.co.uk?

Normal logo.

...google.ie?

Finally! A&nbsp;design! And the alt text saying &quot;Happy St. Patrick's Day.&quot;

And I'm sitting here thinking, ok. I get why the UK address wouldn't have a design, because you've got your Protestants up in Northen Ireland that might have a thing or two to say. But St. Paddy's is hugely celebrated in the US - even by Protestants - basically, everyone who likes a good brew, and even some who don't - so I&nbsp;really don't get it.

Look, I'm a recovering Catholic, I will carry that honkin' scar with me for the rest of my life, but St. Paddy's, like Christmas and Valentine's before it, has been widely secularized in the US, so if Google can do a little design for Easter, why can't they for St. Patrick's Day?

And Trent + tambourine! <br /><br /><lj-embed id=""6""/><br /><br />It was really surreal watching the oscars on Sunday and seeing Trent Reznor win an oscar [with Atticus Finch]. His image and carriage is a far cry from his <em>Downward Spiral</em> days. As much as I love his music with NIN/as NIN, I felt incredibly proud of him. Not at all because I think like &quot;oh, good thing he cleaned up his act,&quot; or that &quot;oscars aren't political at <em>all</em>,&quot; but more of in the...he's continuing to explore the world of music, which he loves...he's trying new things...and exceling. I mean, there's a lot of music in my collection that I don't listen to very often anymore, simply because I'm not feeling the emotions the songs are about. I think he's decided to stop touring not just because he's married and hopes for a family, but because he no longer feels that NIN is his creative outlet. And good for him. Good for him. As much as I think NIN is one of the best bands to ever have existed, good for him. :'') <br /><br />And because that was totes srsbsns, here's The Boosh instead: <br /><br /><lj-embed id=""7""/><br /><br />&quot;Funk?

"event","<br />So it was in the paper today that...ugh....let's start from the beginning, I guess....<br /><br />-My old high school is putting on <em>The Laramie Project</em>.<br /><br />-Gaybashing fuckwads from Westboro were going to come up and protest.<br /><br />-Counter-protest planned.<br /><br />-News comes out that the bashers were coming up because they'd received emails from concerned citizens in the local area.<br /><br />-Senders of emails reveal identity as:<br /><br />MEMBERS OF THE CAST.<br /><br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br /><br />&quot;It was only a joke,&quot; they said.<br /><br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br />WHAT<br /><br />What the <em>fuck?!</em> I mean, seriously?!

Wrong wrong wrong. On so many levels.<br /><br />Firstly, our drama director never, ever, ever chose a controversial play. Ever. And she finally picks something slightly dangerous, and the people she cast end up being a bunch of fucking- fucking- bigoted homophobic shitbombs who deserve to be put onstage in the city square and get ridiculed and get fucking protested themselves and get punched in the face and ostracized from society and <em>see how they fucking like it</em>, let alone kicked out of the fucking play.<br /><br />But will they be?<br /><br />Oh, no.<br /><br />Because I live in a stupid, racist, teabagging, Palin-loving, God-groveling, homophobic, conservative fucking society that needs its eyes FUCKING OPENED and thinks prejudice is a JOKE and I WANT TO LEAVE, LEAVE, LEAVE but I can't do anything but RAGE INEFFECTUALLY ON THE INTERNET IN CAPSLOCK.<br /><br />Fuck.

The first time, the lady was all, &quot;What's that smell? It smells really good. Is that like an air freshener? Or do you have a perfume counter?&quot; I was totally confused, because I didn't smell anything. &quot;Well, the salon is right over there,&quot;&nbsp;I suggested. And the subject was dropped.<br /><br />It wasn't until she'd left that I'd realized it was <em>me</em>&nbsp;she was smelling. It had to have been, because the store had just opened, and I was alone at the counter, there wasn't even another customer about. The salon wasn't really in business yet <em>and</em>, she'd only asked that right after I'd leaned over the counter to look at something she was indicating on a receipt. So, dude.<br /><br />The second time, there was no ambiguity. This lady was asking about some jeans on one of those low tables, so I went over to help her look at styles. I leaned down to pick up a pair, and my hair fell down in a curtain across my face, you know, as it does in romance novels. The lady actually exclaimed, &quot;You smell <em>good</em>!&quot; Me: &quot;Uh, thank you. :)...?&quot;<br /><br />I suppose it has to be my shampoo, because I don't wear perfume or any of that. The thing is, though, that I use an extremely popular name brand. Five million people must use the same stuff. I even switch off scents within that brand. So...what is it? Do the shampoo and conditioner roll extremely well with my hair's natural oils? Did I just eat well last week that I was complimented twice on the smell of my skin's secretions? I, sure as pi, don't know.<br /><br />What I <em>do</em> know is that the sense of smell is the physical sense of the postmodern. I know this because I wrote a fucking paper on it. This all leads me to ask the question, am I, like, the embodiment of the postmodern? Because that's fucking weird, dude. But it's also weird for many strangers, friends, and acquaintances to tell me that I smell good over the years. Not that that's a bad thing...<br /><br />Just saying."

Which is just weird, because it's <em>retail</em>, during the <em>holidays</em>. I mean, really?

I'm sitting around, in a shirt I've worn since the 8th grade, and people are buying 30 dollar shirts? Really? Shirts that, I've notice, are almost always see-through, and this drives me nuts! Nuts nuts nuts nuts nuts. Because I have to wear work appropriate clothing, and it is impossible these&nbsp;days, in any store, to find something that a) does not sparkle, b) does not have flowers, and/or c) isn't fucking see-through! Fucking hell. The classics. They are IMPORTANT.<br /><br />But whatevskies. I'm not being yelled at on the phone any longer, and seen from that perspective, I am ecstatic. Though I still get apprehensive answering the phone when it rings by our registers, not gonna lie.<br /><br /><em>Phones</em>!! *shakes fist*<br /><br />Also, what the hell student riots in London?

Especially since right when I was pulling out of my complex to get onto the street, what should start playing on the radio but &quot;Sabotage&quot; by the Beastie Boys? It was the most perfect timing I've ever had. So JTK began his run as a genius-level repeat offender in the Midwest, so I began my first day as an average-level penniless escapee of the Midwest. For a couple months, at least. I took it as a good sign. Needless to say, I sped all the way to work. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTGeagS4HcU&amp;feature=related"">Thusly (start at about 30 secs in)</a>. Of course, instead of a quarry, there was a river. And a bridge with which to cross it.<br /><br />ANYWAY, I used up the rest of my PTO to get fuck out of there early. YES. So that night, I hunkered down in my sweet bed, anticipating a long night, morning, and perhaps some afternoon of uninterrupted slumber. And what should break through my ears during this celebratory sleep-in? <br /><br />WORK. Behold: <br /><br /><strong>work: </strong>&quot;You're scheduled to work today. You were supposed to be here twenty minutes ago.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>me: </strong><em>(oh god, don't say it, don't say it, don't say the cliche, don't say it!! no you moron!) </em>&quot;...There must have been a mistake. My last day was yesterday.&quot; <em>(You made the mistake!!! Youuuuu!)</em> <br /><br /><strong>work: </strong>&quot;What?&quot; <br /><br /><strong>me: </strong>&quot;Yes. Friday was my last day. I&nbsp;turned in my two weeks.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>work: </strong>&quot;Oh. You turned in your two weeks, when?&quot; <br /><br /><strong>me: </strong><em>(what the fuck is going on? am i in the fucking twilight zone?) </em>&quot;...Two weeks ago. To my team lead.

I'm really sorry.&quot; <em>(why the fuck am i the one apologizing? why am I apologizing to YOU? because you didn't read YOUR email, and speaking of that, why was there a new schedule in my folder yesterday? oh my god, the scheduling guy didn't read his email either, what the FUCK) <br /><br /></em><strong>work: </strong>&quot;Oh, you didn't, I just read the email and forgot about it.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>me: </strong>&quot;That's alright. It's no problem.&quot; <em>(yes it is! this is a fucking problem! we worked together every weekend for a YEAR and you didn't REMEMBER that i would NO LONGER be WORKING with you, after having done so every weekend for a YEAR?! what. the. fuck.) <br /><br /></em><strong>work: </strong>&quot;Okay, sorry about that, bye!&quot; <br /><br /><strong>me: </strong>&quot;Really, it's no problem.

Though this time it was a friend, so that was forgivable. At that point, however, what was the point of a continued&nbsp;lie-in?&nbsp;So I got up. No celebratory sleep for me :( <br /><br />On the other hand,&nbsp;Scottish people are awesome. I know, I know. You're saying, &quot;Of course they're awesome, who doesn't realize that?&quot;,&nbsp;but the point is, they're even more&nbsp;awesome than previously supposed. Like, covered in awesomesauce. Smothered in it.&nbsp;I say this because I&nbsp;was researching rail passes, and they all have very normal names. British Rail Pass....Wales Rail Pass...English Rail Pass....Scottish Rail Freedom Pass... <br /><br />That's right. Scottish Rail&nbsp;Freedom Pass.&nbsp;Surely this means that one has the <em>freedom</em> to use the <em>rail</em> in <em>Scotland</em>, hence <em>Scottish Rail Freedom Pass</em>.

Also, a high school English teacher of ours used to say that school as an institution was a machine, taking all our natural parts and mushing them together to make nigh inedible product: chicken nuggets. So the year he retired (I think his last year of teaching was my senior year), a few of us bought him a thing of chicken nuggets, and we labelled each of them with one of our names. When we proudly presented him this tiny cardboard box of processed meat, he totally tried to hide the fact he wanted to cry. And totally failed!<br /><br />So school has some good memories, I guess. :)<br /><br />"

"event","So I finally caved in and started putting pieces of various short stories into the generator, and <em>what</em>. A lot of people have said that it's consistent for them, but <em>what</em>. I must just write in tons of different styles because for each story I've gotten something different: <br /><br />~Arthur Clarke [Who is that? Should I know who that is?] <br />~JK Rowling [Good descriptions with little depth?] <br />~Stephen King [Lots of dialogue and no description?] <br />~William Shakespeare [Witty with good vocab?] <br />~Mark Twain [Pretty sure I don't write in dialect.] <br />~Dan Brown [NO. NO. NO. NO. itwaswrittenoversixyearsagoisweari'mgoingtorewriteituuugghhh!] <br />~Jack London [He writes about wolves, yeah? Haven't read him since 2nd grade or so.] <br />~Cory Doctorow [Who the fuck is that? SERIOUSLY.] <br />~Chuck Palahniuk [Ok, I'm flattered that my stuff is considered that fucked up, but <em>really</em>?] <br />~JD Salinger [Oh my goodness, I'm so depressed...]<br />~Vladimir Nabokov [Always knew I was a moody Russian.]<br />~Ian Fleming [Do I know him? Is he sci-fi?]<br />~Rudyard Kipling [I've heard good things, but how can I write like someone I've never read?]<br />~Anne Rice [Actually, that...makes a lot of sense. I was reading her at the time.]<br />~Bram Stoker [From the closest thing to porn I've ever written. LIZZIE'S PAPER=VINDICATED.]<br />~Oscar Wilde [Witty AND scathing! Oooooo!]<br /><br />Is there a list of all the authors they pit you against? Because I'm pretty sure I&nbsp;got all of them. <br /><br />I wonder if that's a good thing, or if certain professors would say that I, &quot;haven't found my voice.&quot; <br /><br />Anyway I kept putting in excerpts from my stories [or in the case of some, the entire thing] until, like a merry-go-round, I ended up back at Arthur Clarke. WHO IS THAT? <br /><br />*leaves to engage google-fu* <br /><br />But just in case no one believes me: <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""PROOF."">Here they all are! <br /><br /><!-- Begin I Write Like Badge --><br /><div style=""border-bottom: #ddd 2px solid; border-left: #ddd 2px solid; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; width: 380px; padding-right: 5px; font: 20px/1.2 Arial,sans-serif; background: #f7f7f7; color: #555; overflow: auto; border-top: #ddd 2px solid; border-right: #ddd 2px solid; padding-top: 5px""><img width=""120"" style=""float: right"" alt="""" src=""http://s.iwl.me/w.png"" /><div style=""border-bottom: #eee 1px solid; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 20px; text-shadow: #fff 0 1px"">I write like<br /><a style=""color: #698b22; font-size: 30px; text-decoration: none"" href=""http://iwl.me/w/a19b4b4"">Arthur Clarke</a></div><p style=""text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 11px""><em>I Write Like</em> by M&eacute;moires, <a style=""color: #888"" href=""http://www.codingrobots.com/memoires/"">Mac journal software</a>. <a style=""background: #ffffe0; color: #333"" href=""http://iwl.me""><b>Analyze your writing!</b></a></p></div><br /><!-- End I Write Like Badge --><br /><br /><!-- Begin I Write Like Badge --><br /><div style=""border-bottom: #ddd 2px solid; border-left: #ddd 2px solid; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; width: 380px; padding-right: 5px; font: 20px/1.2 Arial,sans-serif; background: #f7f7f7; color: #555; overflow: auto; border-top: #ddd 2px solid; border-right: #ddd 2px solid; padding-top: 5px""><img width=""120"" style=""float: right"" alt="""" src=""http://s.iwl.me/w.png"" /><div style=""border-bottom: #eee 1px solid; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-top: 20px; text-shadow: #fff 0 1px"">I write like<br /><a style=""color: #698b22; font-size: 30px; text-decoration: none"" href=""http://iwl.me/w/32618206"">J.

"event","<br />I was just reading something, and I laughed so hard I <em>choked</em>. As in, airway completely blocked, if only for a second or two. It sort of gave me a starburst of joy even as I hacked and coughed. I was so delighted, not even my <em>body</em> could handle it.<br /><br />Granted, I watched <em>Death at a Funeral</em> for the first time last night, and I almost got to that point as well.<br /><br />And people say entertainment is pointless!"

"event","<br />So, ages ago I mentioned on this blog that I wrote about 40 notebook pages out in two days. No biggie. I mean, there was some serious hand-cramping, but no biggie. The 'biggie' is that I <em>still</em> haven't finished it yet, because I decided it needs more than an addendum, but an entire other chapter tacked on at the beginning and it's DRIVING ME NUTS.<br /><br />ESPECIALLY because I'm SOOOO about the allusions and just HAVE to intertwine it with the Grimms' Fairy Tales (specifically), though I'll probably put it in English instead of the German, which means I have to translate, which means I have to be so fucking careful, even if it is children's level.<br /><br />There is, perhaps, too much going on right now for me to be angsting over my writerly problems, but seriously. Seriously.<br /><br />Last night there was a series of severe thunderstorms here, and holy shit. Tornados in the city...people's swingsets blown up by lightning...waking up at three different times during the night because the thunder is causing the house to shake...I don't really recall having such bad storms since I was a kid. Crazy times. But it has made me <em>tired</em>. (Granted, having a couple Long Island Iced Teas probably didn't help with that.)<br /><br />But I'm going to work on the &quot;HAHA ISN'T THIS AWESOME I'M MAKING ALLUSIONS TO GERMAN LITERATURE THAT REALLY BELONGS TO THE EUROPEAN ORAL TRADITION&quot; story anyway.<br /><br />Late-uhs."

"event","Never has this icon been more apt, man.<br /><br />So I got back from vacation earlier this week, and have been trying to adjust to the new routine at work. Because my workplace is so scheduling-oriented, it's not just my shifts that have changed. HOWEVER, I knew my shifts were going to fuck me up more than anything else that's changed, I just <em>knew</em> it. Now I have proof. Why, you might ask?<br /><br />I just got up at 9 o'clock when I could have gotten up at 10.<br /><br />I come running down the stairs:<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> &quot;You're up early.&quot;<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>&quot;Actually, I'm running late.&quot;<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> &quot;I thought you said you worked around 11.&quot;<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>&quot;Yes, of course.&quot; *looks at watch* &quot;N-...no. Nooooo.&quot; *throws up arms a la Darth Vader* &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;<br /><br />So here I am, catching up on this here blog.<br /><br />Vacation was nice, if as short as one never wants them to be. My skin really outdid itself this time; it's this interesting shade of pink. Perhaps a light coral, perhaps salmon would be more apt with the undersides still being white...for a while I was considering the term 'sunrise,' as some of it actually looked a bit orange for a day or two. In some lighting, one could even have termed it 'peach.' I saw one of my friends who just bought a house with her fiance a few days ago, and we spent a lot of the time sitting on her gorgeous patio out back. In the sunlight I looked at her, because she was as brown as a nut. From one weekend at the lakes! I spent a week in the Great Lakes area, and I'm squishy salmon pink.<br /><br />I'm not particularly bothered by how tan I am, really, but it's annoying looking like your arms and face have kool-aid stains on them.<br /><br />Lastly, and perhaps most hilariously, the internet has been down just about citywide since I came back from vacation. The company that pretty much has a monopoly on internet and phones and cable and whatnot around here were doing some 'routine maintenence' with, possibly, an 'upgrade,' and managed to crash the whole system so badly, that they had to order parts from out of town and wait for them to get here. Apparently yesterday, the day the parts came in from the airport, there was a huge riot down by the cable place. Like, a riot. In <em>Fargo</em>. HILARIOUS! And apparently the workers felt so guilty, they didn't even call the cops. I love it. I really do.<br /><br />Of course, I only laugh now because <em>it's working again</em>. Being without internet on vacation is one thing. Being without it at home is quite another.<br /><br />So much to catch up on.<br /><br />In news that is only progressing, I am about 150 pages into Steven Moore's <em>The Novel: An Alternative History</em> and I am loving every word of it. Hopefully I'll get my butt in gear and review it afterward.<br />"

"event","I had to make one, because Finland's Oulanka National Park must be the closest thing to fairy tales on Earth. I didn't even <em>know</em> there were such things as 'candle spruces.'&nbsp; How lovely it would be to go there!<br /><br />In other news, networks have been announcing their cancellations...I think the fact that NBC's cancelling <em>Law &amp; Order</em>&nbsp; wouldn't be so bad if they weren't comissioning <em>Law &amp; Order: LA </em>which they've unfortunately dubbed &quot;LOLA.&quot; Really, NBC? Really?&nbsp;I get cancelling <em>Heroes</em>, though. I'll be excited to see the actors in other things now. :)<br /><br />I'm sort of on the fence about ABC's cancelling <em>Flashfoward</em>. I really like <em>Flashfoward</em>, and it has a phenomenal cast. Unfortunately its first season hasn't been as well-executed as were, say, those of <em>Heroes</em> or <em>LOST</em>, but I've grown to like a few of the characters and I'm certainly going to continue watching it until it ends. That said, I think if ABC had gone the British route and only asked for one season, the show would probably be tighter and with fewer characters (since I think some are completely superfluous and did not need whole episodes dedicated to them). It would also make sense, since the show is leading up to&nbsp;one big event. It would have been nice and contained that way...oh well. One thing that I'll miss a lot, non-plotwise, is the excellent way they've been handling interracial couples and homosexual characters. They mention the issues without dwelling on them and actually allow the characters to be<em>&nbsp;people</em>, as opposed to just being symbols or stereotypes.<br /><br />Oh, and another thing- I think <em>Flashfoward</em> has amazing music editing. For realsies.<br /><br />Lastly for this post, my mother and sister seem agreed that the way my hands have been hurting is indicative of a certain kind of arthritis. I'm too young to have arthritis, dammit.&nbsp;But my mother says she had it too when she was young, and had to quit piano because of it, so I'm hoping that once I'm able to quit my stupid job my hands won't hurt anymore. I hate going to the doctor. And I need to be able to type up my stories! I haven't been doing that for a couple months now, because it's just too much in conjunction with work. At least I lowered my hours.<br /><br />Also, what made me more sad than the fact I probably have arthritis is that if I had continued piano for a couple more years, then I probably would have had to quit too, and would never have been able to realize playing Beethoven's sonatas anyway.&nbsp; So even though that dream was mostly a dead duck already, now it <em>really</em> can't come true. Well. Not without copious amounts of pain meds.<br /><br />And per usual, typing up a blog isn't helping! ;)<br /><br /><br />"

"event","<br />Long time no post, eh?<br /><br />I feel incredibly guilty - well ok, just part of me does - because I've just started my new and improved ONE LESS DAY OF WORK SCHEDULE and I did NOTHING I wanted to get done. Except get lots of lovely sleep. I enjoy sleep.<br /><br />I've been ruminating about a post lately, but last week I was lucky enough to get to see Craig Ferguson live, and whilst talking about people's lack of filter when it comes to the internet he said:<br /><br />-Does this need to be said?<br />-Does this need to be said by me?<br />-Does this need to be said by me now?<br /><br />He obviously couched it in between some hilarious material, but I've thought it a rather good list of what need and need not be posted on one's blog...I've just learned a lot of things lately from my mother's reminiscence of growing up in the 60s and watching the British version of <em>Who Do You Think You Are? </em>which has given me mad history lessons...and so I think I have to sit on it a little while longer.<br /><br />Speaking of British television, I've been trying to catch up on all my panel shows, and of course I get distracted by the new ones, so I waste hours and hours...and then I was surprised to find out that my favorite one that usually plays in the summer was given a season this winter/spring. A few things caught my attention, the main one of which was that one of my favorite panellists had left the show to follow his career, whatever, etc,&nbsp;etc.<br /><br />And this CERTAINLY DOES NOT need to be said by me, but dammit man, I realized that one of the reasons it bothers me so much is that he's Scottish, and now where am I going to get my regular dose of my favorite accent?&nbsp; I can name more Welsh comedians than I can Scottish comedians. It could be that my cross-section of panel shows isn't very broad, but I <em>do</em> watch several of them, and actually cannot think of another Scottish comedian at the moment (though I know I've seen them). It bothers me. It's bothersome! We all know the long history between England and Scotland, and a lot of that sort of....casual racism that exists between all people of different countries, but <em>damn</em>, is the public still that bad in Britain that it's harder for Scots to get on the air? Or is it sort of a mutual thing where the Scots probably just hang out on BBC&nbsp;Scotland and don't give a shit?<br /><br />I don't know. I'm not British. I'm not even European. And....it's not like I don't know that people can be wankers in this day and age, but...I like to think that we've come somewhere. Perhaps that's why the new companion on <em>Doctor Who</em>, that most venerable show, is finally another Scot [though I don't know whether the actress is]?<br /><br />I suppose it's&nbsp;neither here nor there&nbsp;for a young American like me, but I would still like to point out that I just watched the episode of <em>Mock the Week</em> that aired on my birthday, and THREE of the panellists had my nickname. That is HALF of the panellists on the show.<br /><br />Oh, British television. I love you, too. :)"

But this patience flies right out the window when your conversation runs as follows:<br /><br />&quot;I'm going to say something. And then I'm going to say it again. I'm going to repeat myself. I'm repeating. I'm saying something repeatedly. To repeat something you're saying is to repeat. When you're saying something, and repeating, you're saying something again. I'm saying something more than once. Again, I'm saying something, and again, I'm repeating. I'M REPEATING SOMETHING. Saying something more than once is repeating. Repeatedly saying something is to say it more than once. And if you're saying something more than once, you're saying something. More than once.&quot;<br /><br />QUIT WASTING MY FUCKING TIME. I cannot <em>believe</em>&nbsp;how many people actually talk like this. Don't get me wrong- I'm pretty longwinded because I'm verbose and often confused. My mother, on the other hand, is longwinded because she's a natural storyteller and she embellishes things. But these people? It's almost like a neurosis. They are <em>incapable</em>&nbsp;of saying one sentence and being done with it. I have (and this is decidedly NOT an exaggeration) heard people go on for a good minute or two saying the same thing, over and over and over and over and over. Here's a tip: if the person you're talking to didn't get it the first couple times around, they aren't going to get it the 105th either. Shut. Up.<br /><lj-cut text=""Pet Peeve #8""><br /><strong>Pet Peeve #8: </strong>Speaking in double digits<br /><br />It seems ridiculous, but it's true. Double digits are awful. It is <em>my job</em>&nbsp;to outdial quickly, and I get reprimanded if I'm caught being a slowpoke.<br /><br />To be honest, this wouldn't be&nbsp;a pet peeve at all if people were nice. But they aren't nice. Because this is what happens: someone says, &quot;14.&quot; The word 'fourteen' starts with 'four,' which of course mentally translates as '4' and my finger has already pushed the button.&nbsp; Then you continue on saying the rest of your number, while I'm backspacing, recording everything you're saying in my short term memory, and hoping that I haven't messed up- because may all deities <em>forbid</em>&nbsp;that I ever, ever ask you to repeat yourself. Even if I preface it with something really obsequious like, &quot;I'm so sorry, I want to make sure I have this right for you; could you please repeat the number?&quot;, people get irritated and think one or all of the following (this also goes for people who say all the digits like they're one word,&nbsp;eg &quot;seveneightnine&quot; instead of &quot;seven, eight, nine&quot;):<br /><br />-I'm stupid<br />-I'm not doing my job<br />-I'm doing it purposely<br />-the world is against them<br />-maybe yelling will help<br /><br />Once, after asking to verify the number, a person told me that if I never paid attention to anything, then I wouldn't get anywhere in life. And addressed me, quite patronizingly, as &quot;honey.&quot;<br /><br />I'd also like to add here that they said it several times, a la PP #7.<br /><br /><strong>Pet Peeve #9: </strong>Inappropriate usage of answering machine/voicemail recordings<br /><br />There are so many possible subcategories to this pet peeve you don't even know, but I'll stick with the major ones. The reason I call these 'inappropriate' is because if you're not there to answer the phone, and what I have to say is important - or really, anyone trying to reach you - a message has to be left. In order to leave a message, one is <em>forced</em> to hear everything that you've recording. There are oh, so many ways to be offensive. So let's get started!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>9a). </strong>Music.&nbsp; <br /><br />Look guys, it's bad enough when people have bad music as a ringtone. Vivaldi is a popular one, for sure, and I don't mind listening to him several times a day. Vivaldi was <em>dynamic</em>. But I get really fed up when I have to hear that <em>I miss you, don't you know I miss you, so kiss me through the phone! kiss me through the phone! kiss me through the phone! </em>, or that <em>I'm sitting in the sand, god is great and I got a beer in my hand</em>. That is horrific enough, especially when I get little snippets of these songs in my head, songs I'd never have to hear if you didn't spend your money on crappy ringtones. But then, the voicemail picks up. And hark, IT'S ANOTHER OF YOUR OMGZ!!1! FAVERIT SONGZ!<br /><br />Have you ever wondered how long your cell phone will let you record your voicemail greeting? Well, wonder no more: it's a long fucking time! I've never actually figured it out, but I'd say perhaps a whole minute. That might not seem like too long, but when you're listening to a bad song coming through a cell phone that was held up to a stereo? YOU GROW GREY HAIRS. Yet there's nothing that can be done. That's why I&nbsp;find it offensive- it's crossing the line from expressing yourself to forcing other people to listen.<br /><br />Not to mention that it doesn't say what number was dialed, or even anything about who you are. Except that you're a massive douchebag with no respect for other people's sensibilities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>9b). </strong>Religion. I...I don't have the words to express&nbsp;the incredulity, exasperation, nigh on hatred, and morbid fascination&nbsp;I feel concerning&nbsp;the fact that about 7 times out of ten, personalized recordings include <em>Christianity</em>.<br /><br />Seriously, what the fuck. Here are some of the usuals:<br /><br />&quot;Have a blessed day.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;God bless you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bless this day the Lord has made.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;May God bless you real good.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Praise the Lord.&quot;<br /><br />I mean, really? Really? There is little that's more disconcerting than hearing a machine run thusly:<br /><br />&quot;Hello! You've reached Joe Schmoe. I can't come to the phone right now, so please leave your name and number and a brief message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Jesus is our savior.&quot;<br /><br />This sort of thing is&nbsp;shocking on two levels. One, because it's a complete non sequitur to me. Two, because to them, <em>it isn't</em>. I suppose for some of them it's just...what they say. Especially &quot;Have a blessed day.&quot; I've heard that from all over the country, though sure, most usually in the South.&nbsp;Yet for many of them, such as the last couple examples, it simply comes off as proselytizing. Failing that, just plain old guilt (what Christians do best, oo-rah).<br /><br />To be honest, it's possible I&nbsp;get guilt associations because I am, in fact, a recovering Catholic. But it's kind of hard not to feel it anyway when someone says, &quot;DON'T FORGET TO BLESS THIS DAY THE LORD HAS MADE!!&quot;, because it sort of implies that if you don't, you're going to hell. You're eeeevvviiiillllll. Maybe even with a capital 'E'. And then of course my mind goes off on all these philosophical and philological tangents, and why you never, ever, <em>ever</em> should use a religious&nbsp;imperative on someone else, and how the bible is like every other mythological text, why the hell do you think you're so righteous and all the while there's still a part of my brain that's going, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT? I CALLED TO LEAVE A MESSAGE, NOT GET A FUCKING HEADACHE.<br /><br />To sum up, if you're trying to figure out what to put on your answering machine or voicemail recording, ask yourself these questions:<br /><br />-Is this sentence completely necessary?<br />-Could this offend someone?<br />-Is it too long?<br />-What bothers me about other people's recordings?<br />-If a potential (and busy!) employer calls, what do I want them to hear?<br /><br />For the record, I use the automated voicemail with my name in the middle. It's personalized, but still...impersonal. It tells people what they need to know, no more, no less.<br /><br /><br />Okay, so that last part got really 'srs bsns,' but it&nbsp;truly bothers me, and I think everyone should be more aware of the others around them. And sure, that's including myself. People don't tend to think about little things like their voicemail because it's usually their friends or family that are calling, and chances are they enjoy the same music or have the same religious beliefs. But the world is diverse, guys, and your friends aren't the only people dialing your number.<br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br />Thus concludes <strong>Part Deux</strong>. Until next time, your loyal local phone operator.<br /><br /><br />"

"event","There's&nbsp;a reason they call it frost<em>bite</em>.<br /><br />Almost a month ago I got minor frostbite on my fingers. A few days ago, I&nbsp;forgot to put on lotion one time. ONE TIME, and my fingers started peeling. Not dramatically or anything, but it's there. Right on the pads. And all I&nbsp;can think of is, <em>Oh shit, one less layer between me and the germy keyboards at work. THERE IS ONE LESS LAYER SEPARATING MY BLOODSTREAM FROM WORKPLACE COOTIES! AAARRGGGHH!!<br /><br /></em>It's gross. Worse is that my skin is still tender, even where it isn't peeling. I think because I can still feel it, there isn't any nerve damage. In fact, right after I'd gotten the frostbite and my hands started to thaw and I was keeping up a steady chant of <em>fuckfuckfuck</em> to keep from crying, that was my only comfort. That I could still feel.<br /><br />And then a couple hours later, when I felt like I was bleeding from the cuticles, my second comfort was: Well, at least if a character I&nbsp;write about ever gets frostbite, I'll know how to describe it. In excruciating detail.<br /><br />Also, my upper limbs hurt in general because my last 'weekend' I&nbsp;typed up thirty pages of my writing, single-spaced. Then I worked five days straight, typing all the while, and then I had to give my sister a massage because her back was acting up again. MY ARMS. MY WRISTS. MY POOR FINGERS.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm going driving, and since I clutch the wheel like a 95-yr-old who can barely see over the dash, that's not going to really help in the arm dept.<br /><br />Nor is typing this blog entry.<br />"

"event","<br />So tonight my mother hosted cards at our house so she made a lot of finger foods, many of which she only makes when all her friends are over for cards, so we rarely eat them. The most awesome dish is wrapping mini beef hot dogs with bacon, smothering it in brown sugar, and cooking in the oven for x amount of time. Now let's get some things straight:<br /><br />1) I haven't actively eaten hot dogs since childhood. They make me gag nowadays.<br /><br />2) I haven't actively eaten bacon since childhood. It makes me gag nowadays.<br /><br />However, I brought this recipe to Germany and made it for a bunch of folk who DEVOURED it back in high school, and since my mother always hosts cards in February, I haven't had it since I matriculated. Now that I'm back, and it's February, I got through work today thinking, &quot;Ho shi- LOST and mini-hotdog-bacon-sugar-toothpick thingies!&quot;<br /><br />So I got home at about 10:45pm, there were thankfully some left, I figured five was a goodly amount and I put it in the microwave to reheat. Then I dug in, thinking thusly:<br /><br />First- Mmm, been so long.<br /><br />Second- This bacon is certainly not as crispy as I would like it.<br /><br />Third- Oh fuck, are there casings on these mini-hotdogs?<br /><br />Fourth- It still tastes good though. But that was definitely a casing. And the bacon is like, not crispy. I can swallow this. I really can. GODDAMNIT, BRAIN, IT TASTES&nbsp;GOOD! Ahhhh but it feels so weird no I'm eating a cow and&nbsp;a pig together and it's mushy and I can't chew the casing OH MY GOD I NEED A PAPER TOWEL AKDJF;AOIDHFA;DHFADFH;A *coughs it up*<br /><br />Fifth- *sits forlornly on plate*<br /><br />So then instead of doing the obvious thing and just, you know, cleaning up the plate, I left it on the island in the kitchen and sat down to watch <em>Lost</em>&nbsp;. And then my mother comes downstairs and is all, &quot;Are you done? But what about this one?&quot; And then I had to tell her the story and CLEARLY she thinks I'm nuts.<br /><br />BECAUSE I AM.<br /><br />I don't know, guys, I'm just so fucking weird. Like the other day I went to brush my teeth, you know, which happens with a great amount of frequency considering, and I <em>missed my mouth</em>&nbsp;and then when I looked at my toothbrush in dismay and betrayal, the toothpaste had fucking <em>disappeared</em>&nbsp;like in that stupid movie <em>Something about Mary</em>, except instead of cum on my ear it was toothpaste on the rug. WHO DOES THAT?<br /><br />LAME. LAME. SO LAME. I clearly have more issues everyday."

I find the phoenix terminology particularly apt at this point in my life. I feel as if I'm in a completely liminal space; the company my mother worked for recently shut down so she's out of a job, my sister just graduated and quit the job that she's worked at for 9 years, and I...am stuck. Seemingly. It's taken quite a bit of time for me to get to the <em>mental</em>&nbsp;point where I feel like I can do something about it. It's extremely frustrating, however...as I don't know where my mother or my sister are going to be in the next couple months, I have to continue putting my own plans on hold. Will I still be here come summertime? I hope to move this summer. Of course, getting over my driving phobia (is there a scientific word? I can't find it) is taking a hell of a lot longer than I'd hoped, especially since we've been getting blizzards off and on and the roads are continuously icy.<br /><br />Two year ago this time, I had just arrived in Italy; two years ago this day was our first day of orientation at the University of Ferrara. A year ago at this time, I was gearing up for my play. It's been, therefore, nigh on a year since I've done theatre. Last Monday, the Guthrie brought a show to Fargo, but I couldn't go because I was working. Of course, if I'm not working, how can I afford anything?<br /><br />The two friends I was planning on moving with, well...one just got promoted and now makes twice what I do, and the other will probably be here for another two years in a graduate writing program. Which is great for them, but I refuse to be here for another two years, but I'm oh so leery of having to room with someone I don't know.<br /><br />But I'm ready."

"event","It's like the changing of the guard, but with less pomp.<br /><br />I assume I'm not the only one who takes it very personally what pictures show up on calendars for her birth month. Strangely, I have two calendars this year: one sent to me for free from Middlebury [in order to weasel money out of me, ha! Nice try.], and one that I&nbsp;randomly got for Xmas that's supposed to be like...the tourist wonders of the world or something. They are both on my wall. So how did they fare?<br /><br /><strong>Middlebury:<em> </em></strong>Somewhat lame-o, but it's better than January's, and the whole calendar's pretty lame-o anyway. But it's a nice shot probably taken somewhere in that trail area leading to Prescott and whatnot, and the title? &quot;Into the Woods.&quot; So, name win! And also the inset picture is of someone advertising polar-bearing on a BiHall blackboard, so that amuses me.<br /><br /><strong>Wonders: </strong>It's no secret that last week was my two-year anniversary of leaving for Italy, which has caused me some melancholy of late. But I turned to this calendar's February photo, and lo! it was the moon shining over the Colosseum. A+<br /><br />In other news, I and a friend have been watching&nbsp;the first season of&nbsp;<em>Heroes </em>and tonight we watched the finale. This was my fourth time watching the&nbsp;season all the way through, and whilst she was lamenting the end itself, I&nbsp;was lamenting how I'd made a pact to not watch the other seasons and ruin the magic. Then I was telling her all the reasons why I wasn't going to watch the other seasons, and how this season's ratings are so low, there's talk of cancellation. Conversation on AIM as follows:<br /><br /><strong>me: </strong>but now i'm hearing from more than one source that the actors have outgrown the show<br /><strong>her: </strong>mmm<br /><strong>her: </strong>yeah. cast that good, show's got to grow to keep up<br /><strong>me: </strong>i hope they cancel only because i want to see them in other things!<br /><strong>me: </strong>it's like with the lotr actors...i will watch anything with them in it<br /><strong>her: </strong>haha<br /><strong>her: </strong>yeah, 10-4<br /><br />Not fifteen minutes later, as we're still discussing the finale and how some parts were handled more gracefully than others, I was browsing the net and checking my usual sites for news. And what did I find? <strong><u>THERE IS TO BE GEORGE GERSHWIN BIOPIC, PERHAPS DIRECTED BY SPIELBERG. AND PROBABLY STARRING ZACHARY QUINTO.<br /><br /></u></strong>Oh movie industry, for once you make me SO HAPPY. As someone who's generally meh on biopics, I'm so excited for this one. I mean, come on!&nbsp;George Gershwin! Who, incidentally, died when 38. I'd no idea he was so young when he died. Which is sad...but think of the music! Think of how this picture will introduce his music to so many more people! And just from an acting perspective, <em>holy shit</em> Zachary Quinto is amazing casting, it is. I'm also very happy for him; for someone who's starred in <em>Heroes</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>, two major sci-fi franchises, he's finally [hopefully] landed a role that will allow him to defy type-casting. Or genre-casting, as it were.<br /><br />I love when my favorite artists do good. They're like my children. I don't know. For some reason other people having success makes me really happy. Like, one of my friends got promoted at work a couple weeks ago and I totally spazzed.<br /><br />It's strange that I was coming home today and thinking I would blog about all the inane things I do to keep myself from going insane at work, and instead I'm just too <em>joyful</em> to even think about it much. ART: MY ANTI-...MONOTONY!!<br /><br />Somewhat relatedly, Netflix, you have failed me. You don't have any version of <em>Porgy and Bess? </em>Not even one? Really?<br />"

So perhaps there was a little bit more to spread around. So...my mother and my sister banded together and got me an ipod nano. I...pretty nearly shat myself. I mean, I think it's hilarious because it can't even fit half my music (plus a couple audiobooks), but it is so cool! So incredibly cool. My sister got an engraving put on the back that's an inside joke between us, so now its name is &quot;Federico Rhombus,&quot; and it's one of the new ones that has camera and radio and pedometer and a-ton-of-other-shit capability...and I stayed up most of the night on xmas synching it and playing with it and listening to it! ...Even though I had to work the next day.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next subject! Usually during xmas break, I would enjoy xmas, and spend the next few days chilling out with my small pile of shiny new things and deciding where they would go in my room and poking them and grinning at them and hoarding them close to my heart like a dragon in his golden cave of SHINY! But this year I, like an 'adult,' had to work the next day. And there had been a blizzard so it was hella hard getting across the river in the first place...because I work in a different state like a douche...and then I&nbsp;was depressed all day because I&nbsp;wasn't playing with my ipod.<br /><br />AND I MISS THE DAYS WHEN THE EXTENDED LOTRs WOULD COME OUT AND THEN I'D SPEND XMAS BREAK WATCHING ALL FOUR DISCS IN A ROW JUST BECAUSE I COULD.<br /><br />I mean, this year was seriously the first year since I was <em>maybe</em> in high school where I&nbsp;felt a little bit of that old xmas magic from when I believed in Santa and all that jazz. I...really miss that feeling. I'm so very grateful to my mother and sister for allowing me to experience that again. I can't even remember the last time I got a gift I&nbsp;wasn't expecting! I love these kinds of surprises. What I don't like is that there's a&nbsp;small pile consisting of a book and&nbsp;a couple dvds that are staring woefully up at me from my bedroom floor because I haven't touched them since xmas day.<br /><br />However, I <em>am</em> earning this strange adult phenomenon called &quot;PTO&quot;, and so...I'll be earning like a week's vacation per year? Week and a half? I guess. AUGUST, HERE I COME!!"

"event","<br />-and this will be the shortest and most spoiler-FREE review I have ever written. Behold:<br /><br /><u><strong>PLOT</strong></u><strong>: </strong>Oh, James Cameron. Why did you go the way of George Lucas? Why oh why, as you sip Dom Perignon in a diamond&nbsp;flute bought from <em>Titanic</em>&nbsp;royalties, could you not have hired brilliant scriptwriters? But nooooooooooooo, you had to write it yourself. The result? LAMEST PLOT EVER. I could tell you the fate of every single character the second they came onscreen. Punkt. No exceptions. And we never quite reached <em>character</em> 3D, did we, Cameron, oh you Cameron? Two-dimensionality, sure. Better than <em>The Tale of Two Cities</em>? Undoubtedly. But shit, son, I can do better than that and I've never written a feature-length script before. For realsies, babe.<br /><br /><strong><u>ACTING</u>: </strong>I was impressed by how the three leads imbued heart into such a lackluster script. I loved Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington was, shall we say, quite worthy, and Zoe Saldana is undoubtedly the BAMFiest BAMF to ever BAMF the BAMF. Seriously, and I rarely get a chance to say this, so I'm going to all-caps it: A WOMAN HAD THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM, OH YES, OH YES SHE DID. And motion-capture, at that.<br /><br />And finally,<br /><br /><strong><u>THE VISUALS</u>: </strong>Um, I came. Metaphorically. I have been visually spoiled for films, forever and ever and ever. And ever. And also, for eveeeerrr. IT'S SO PRETTY. IT WAS THE MOST GORGEOUS THING I'VE EVER SEEN. I'M GOING TO GO TO PANDORA AND HIT THE GLOWING FUNGI AND AND SCARE THE GLOWY-FLY-Y LIZARDS AND RIDE THE GIANT FUCKING DINOSAUR DRAGONS. Because this was a 'sci-fi' film, but really it was a fantasy novel. And I approve of this.<br /><br />I saw this with some friends, and after we got out of the crushing crowd and into the hallway, we just stood staring at each other. At length the one friend who's about as geeky as me (if not geekier) broke the silence: &quot;This is me. Speechless.&quot; I nodded emphatically. It was trufax.<br /><br /><strong><u>VERDICT</u>:</strong>&nbsp;Go see it. Yeah, it's two and a half hours, and yeah, it's predictable from start to finish. But that's not the point. It's a turning point in cinema. When I saw a little kid after the moving walking out with his parents, all I could think was, &quot;They didn't make movies like this when I was little. How absolutely JAZZED must his imagination be right now? What wonderful things will he create in the future because his brain was so inspired?&quot; And see it in 3D, too. It's just...not going to be the same seeing it in any other format....even though 3D televisions will be on the market within a year or two....not the same. Not the same."

AND SUDDENLY I GET AN INCOMING TEXT FROM STASIA. It read: &quot;What's for dinner?&quot;

Sometimes all the stars align. And I fucking love it! :)!"

"event","So there are typing tests at my job, even after you're hired. I was under the impression that it was every month, but apparently it isn't, because recently they've put up a result sheet for the past few months. I looked under my PIN, and have since looked at it several more times. Why? Because my score was <strong>104 words/minute </strong>with <strong>99% accuracy</strong>. That's right, bitches!

Of course, I had no idea which call it was that was tested, but someone told me a few weeks ago which it was- and now that the results have been put up, I've been hearing people get the next round <em>every shift</em>. I haven't gotten it again yet, but I know when I do I'm going to be all nervous and make ten billion typos like I do for my surveys.

In more interesting news, I wanted to know who had the best score, so I scanned all the results. And someone, <em>someone</em> got 128 wpm with 100% accuracy. Who the fuck was <em>that</em>?! Seriously. Are they a MACHINE? My only explanation is that they've been working there for years and know the test call by heart. That's seriously all I can think of. I bet I would type more quickly by heart, too. And more accurately.

It might be Tuesday night, but today's my Friday! Woohoo! Weekend!"

"event","So...because of my schedule this month, my two days off are Wednesday and Thursday. I do not like this, and not just because Tuesday is effectively my Friday. First of all, it's five days of work in a row, without giving my hands any significant rest. Secondly, after getting used to having a break every couple of days from my previous schedules, I dislike feeling like I have to wait a whole week in order to get anything done. For example, I have a story that was handwritten in the middle of October. It has yet to be typed up and edited. I would now like to point out that it is the middle of November. And so? When I typed out &quot;ELF vs. VULCAN&quot; my hands were sore and shaky <em>for days</em> afterward. I. Do not approve. Of this schedule. 

Add to that the fact that today I got yelled at, called a name, and/or called a liar no less than 5 times today. Seriously, I, people. Seriously. Is it so hard to believe that I might need to ask to repeat a number once in a while? Or, you know, use a couple homophones in my typing? 

*sigh* I know I shouldn't be complaining. The insurance finally kicked in this month, and I've got to be grateful for that. But it's just so frustrating when I've finally got the creative juices flowing again and I can't tap the barrel and let them pour out. I actually felt like writing <em>poetry</em> today, if that's any indication as to how I was feeling. I got...hmm...I think six and a half stanzas in before I lost the thread of it and got disgusted with myself. THEN I got the urge to <em>draw</em>, which is always a bad sign for my mental health. I did draw...a person... 

Now, my drawing style isn't in any way learned or honed, but I can do passable sketches of things. Until you get to the face. Humans, horses, dogs- the species doesn't matter. I cannot draw faces. Then the sketches go from passable to CARTOON, which is awesome if you're going for that, but I'm usually not. So then I had a person on the page, fully formed except for eyes, nose, and mouth...a blank face...non-staring at me...and then I spent the rest of my shift contemplating whether or not that was a metaphor for my difficulty in artistic expression, a difficulty that my professors at school had easily seen and pointed out. 

So that was my work day! Now I shall retire, since even after this short bit, my hands and wrists are protesting mightily. Good eve."

"event","I've been reading like a fiend this week! Awesome. Since starting in college, I'd sort of forgotten what it was like being on a roll like that. My appetite is slowly building up again, as it were. I finished <em>The Road </em>after one shift at work. One shift! It was a quick read. And now I'm reading some Gaiman! But let us begin with the beginning; I read <em>Das Parfum</em> first. I will also here add that I'm a bit sick of my own verbosity, so I'll to be a little less longwinded with this. Hopefully. For the sake of my overworked knuckles. 

<strong><u><em>Das Parfum</em> by Patrick S&uuml;skind</u></strong>

This book, copyright 1985, is a story about a boy born in 18th century France. This is not just any boy: this boy gives off no kind of scent, but has the best <em>sense</em> of smell that ever there was. His name is Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. And he is a megalomaniacal genius.

I'm really not one for what people consider postmodern literature. I'm also sure I'm biased, because I loved reading it in the original German, but this book was really, really good. Truly. It has the benefit of being a historical novel with an omniscient third person narrator from the present, which at times gives some necessary commentary. It also allows to not only enjoy this portrait of an artist, as it were, but a collage of lives and other people that he affects in his self-serving journey; we learn not only that Grenouille meets them, but we learn who they are and why they're there in the first place. It's at times sad, horrifying, hilarious, and mystifying. Indeed, <em>Das Parfum</em> has the dubious honor of being the only book that has ever inspired one of my nightmares. It was obviously therefore weighing heavily on my mind after I finished it. These are the basic categories of thought that I pondered whilst reading it:

1) Scent and Beast; Scent and Man; Scent and Language
2) The Artist and his Work
3) Is Feminism Gonna Hafta Choke a Bitch (Back)?
4) The Postmodern Fairy Tale


<lj-cut text=""spoilers herein"">1) SCENT AND BEAST; SCENT AND MAN; SCENT AND LANGUAGE

I have a shittonne to say about this category, actually, but since I've read articles and indeed, written a paper about scent in literature, I'm going to gloss over a lot of it.

Our sense of smell is not something we pay all that much attention to unless there's something thats bothering us. In other words, if something reeks. Or, if someone just cleaned their house, we might say it smells 'nice.' We completely underestimate how important our sense of smell actually is. Instead, we pay a lot more attention to what our eyes tell us. This has consequences in how we see animals, ourselves, and of course, how we speak.

We all know that the majority of mammals and other beasts have a sense of smell that is far superior to ours. Our police force has bomb dogs and drug dogs and basic &quot;follow this scent&quot; dogs. Animals use their sense of smell to follow trails, to hunt. Creatures like snakes who don't have good senses of sight or hearing 'taste' the air (as, of course, our senses of smell and taste are completely intertwined). Inevitably, perhaps, humans then associate this sense more than any other with <em>beasts</em>. Creatures. The Other.

An excellent example of this happens to be in the film <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. When the four hobbits are still in the Shire, they are forced to hide in a hollow in the roots of a tree when the Black Riders are following them. The scene is quiet; no score was written over these images. We hear the horse snort. The laboured breathing of the hobbits. The soft <em>whump</em> of the Rider dismounting to the soft forest floor. And then: <em>snuffling</em>. The Nazgul is trying to <em>sniff</em> the hobbits out. That is far more creepy than a figure in a black cloak. I even remember it grossing my mother out- &quot;Oh god, can you hear it <em>sniffing</em>?&quot;

Why do we find this creepy? Why should we find it gross? Well, thinking it over, I guess the answer should be obvious. <em>We have no control over our scents</em>. It's something we can't hide. We simply smell- and we can't really stop ourselves from smelling.

<em>Das Parfum</em> states this unequivocally. No one can hide from Grenouille. He can tell everything about them, just by smelling them out. No perfume can hide your scent, but simply add to it, make it more complicated. But that brings us to Grenouille himself- the being with no scent, but the best sense of smell. Does that make him less human? Less of a man?

&quot;Grenouille&quot; is French for <em>frog</em>. Of course, most of us wouldn't really associated frogs with sense of smell. But what we do know about frogs is that they <em>aren't</em> known for their beauty, in any stages of their lives. And they live in lakes, marshes. Pond scum. Little creatures that we could squash with our feet. Already, just by his name, he is dehumanized. What's more, all throughout the book there is a recurring analogy that describes Grenouille as a tick. Ticks can wait for years on the trunk of a tree, growing smaller and weaker. And it has two choices: it can drop to the ground and die, or it can lie in wait, just a little bit longer, and wait for that warm little blood bag to walk by...and burrow into its fur...and become bloated on its feast...

And yet Grenouille was born of human parents. For all intents and purposes, he <em>is</em> human. His name might be Frog, he may have lived his life like a tick, he may hibernate like a bear, he might hunt his prey by sniffing them out. He does all of these things, but what makes him most inhuman is the fact that he has no scent at all. His surrogate wetnurse claims that he must be the devil's child to have no scent. He gets raised in an orphange by a woman who lost her sense of smell at a young age, so she wasn't much bothered with him (but she also felt no passion in life). People don't notice him when he walks by and forget him after he's gone. In essence it means he has no personality, no sense of self. This leads Grenouille to an existential crisis. The only thing in the world he cannot know, cannot control, cannot <em>see</em>, is himself.

In this way other people are more like animals than they at first seem. They might not pay attention to their sense of smell, but it's what warms them about Grenouille, or makes him invisible to them. Likewise, Grenouille can take advantage of this and control them by creating all different sorts of perfumes to ellicit the desired reaction, whether it be positive or negative. In Grenouille's eyes, this makes him a god. So he doesn't have a smell? Well, good. Better than being like that powerless, incense-smelling god of the church. He can make people follow his well without them even understanding why. They'll put it in their terms: that he's beautiful, or wonderful, or smart. They don't know the sense of smell and can't describe it. Grenouille is, and his power is, in a sense intangible.

Of course, intangible means, literally, that he can't be touched. This is naturally inaccurate, but it must be so. We as humans do not possess the vocabulary to adequately express the many nuances of the sense of smell. Of the five main senses, of course we give the most credit to sight. When we understand, we &quot;see.&quot; When we think something seems, it can also &quot;look like.&quot; Sight is light or dark. Hearing is loud or quiet. Taste is bitter, salty, sour, sweet, spicy. Touch is soft, hard, rough, smooth, warm, cold. But what is smell? We can associate any sort of generic adjective to an aroma: good, bad, strong, wonderful, disgusting. We can say that it <em>smells</em> - which is a negative attribute. We can say it reeks. It stinks. We sniff. We snuffle. We sneeze. Metaphorically, something can 'smell fishy.' Or we can 'smell a rat.' Where are the adjectives, the verbs, the phrases that are there first and foremost to serve our noses?

Humans don't rely on their sense of smell as much as they used to, and this has in turn led to a deficit of language, which has then, in its own turn, led to our lack of understanding. How can we fully understand something we can't describe? Throughout the book people struggle to describe smells. They're limited to comparing some scents with other scents. Sometimes smells are different colors. Sometimes they're as smoooth as silk or soft as a summer's night. Grenouille &quot;sees&quot; people when he smells them. He doesn't look at them; he sniffs at them. The result of this is that <em>Das Parfum</em> is inescapably visual and utterly gutteral.

It must have been a real puzzle to work out whilst writing, and within the book it must have been a real puzzle for Grenouille. Grenouille was more than a genius, he was an artist. If he cannot describe his art, but perceive it, then fine. But if others can perceive it only in the simplest of ways? If they can't describe it? If they can only think that it's pretty? If they don't even understand that it's a scent at all?

2) THE ARTIST AND HIS WORK

One thing that <em>Das Parfum</em> does well is that it made me, at times, fall on Grenouille's side. Yeah, he's a sociopath and a serial killer. But he's also a genius, and an artist, and there's really no escaping that.

Don't get me wrong, I find Grenouille a grotesque creature. He's outwardly ugly <em>and</em> inwardly ugly. This is only partially his fault; his childhood is almost by the book in terms of creating a sociopath. He never received one iota of love from anyone in his life, not even from his mother. The <em>least</em> from his mother. Later on he kills in pursuit of his art. I do not in any way find this acceptable. However, <em>Das Parfum</em> brings up some salient points concerning art and the crafts of the artist.

The first perfumer under whom Grenouille studies is one Giuseppe Baldini (hells yeah random Italian words in a German text with this dude!). Baldini's problem is that he comes from a line of perfumers. He understands all the ins and outs of making perfumes and sachets and other scented things. He knows how to separate the scent from the thing that gives it off. He knows good smells from bad smells. What Baldini <em>doesn't</em> have, is creativity. He's not with fasion. He doesn't know what's 'in'. But copying what's in? <em>Improving</em> upon what's in? You couldn't ask for a finer perfumer for the job.

To me, Baldini is like the hundreds of nameless artists of the Renaissance and other periods wherein it took years to study the crafts or painting or sculpting, and the like. That's why there are so many pieces of art that are attributed to workshops: the student painted like the master. It was only when he was out from under his master that he could innovate. And if he didn't innovate? He still got jobs painting chapels and portraits. He just didn't get solicited by the Pope.

Then things started to change. All of a sudden, you didn't need years of painstaking study learning perspective. With greater manufacturing abilities, you didn't need to mix your own paints. It started with those like the Pre-Raphaelites and later with Picasso, who studied the classical painting styles before throwing them away. Then, people didn't study it at all, or at least not in earnest. People can, nowadays, take a can of paint from the store, splash it on a canvas, and call it art. Odds are that people will love it.

Baldini is watching the other, popular perfumers of the city who never even apprenticed with anyone. And he feels hatred, betrayed by his profession. He feels worthless, because he's the only one that sees the worth in the <em>craft</em> of it anymore. But Grenouille? Grenouille has creativity in spades, he just doesn't have the means to express it. So Baldini helps Grenouille, and lets him create, and allows himself to be pulled into the whirlpool of success because it earns him money.

Go figure.

(I think there is always something to be said for craft. I dislike Picasso, but I respect him because he learned how to do things the traditional way, and there was method in his innovations, as odd as they were. You see, just because something is new and is the current fad does not mean it is worth thousands of dollars. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, MIDDLEBURY COMMITTEE OF ART IN PUBLIC PLACES.)

At any rate, <em>Das Parfum</em> demonstrates many things. The 18th century is a turning point in the Western World politically, what with all the wars and revolutions. It is a turning point economically, with new tools and industrialization and the urbanization and utter, utter, unhealthiness. It is a turning point scientifically, when new theories are being trotted out everyday, though they still have to struggle to understand what is idiocy and what is scientific truth (which for me leads to the most hilarious character in the book, but that's probably because I wrote a paper last year on a scientist/philospher from the 1600s). All of these turning points in society, philosophy, industry, and science of course leads to changes in the artistic world.

The book also deals with the artist and his work on a more personal level. Besides the fact he had a fucking horrible life and no one gave him the least bit of a break, the point where I felt for Grenouille the most was near the end of the book. Grenouille had just created and worn his masterpiece, a perfume mixed from the 25 most delicious scents of virgin adolescent women. The crowd goes from hating to adoring him in the amount of time it takes for them to get a few whiffs of the aroma. Then, as they breathe it in more and more, they basically start an orgy. With the whole city. And instead of the triumph that Grenouille imagined, he is disgusted and full of hatred for their reaction. He runs away.

As it mentions at the beginning of the book, no one has heard of Grenouille, despite the fact he was as depraved as de Sade, a genius like Napolean. His name alone does not live in infamy, because his art, what he conquered, concerned the world of smell. And so, as Grenouille runs away, he thinks about the fact that he has made the greatest perfume in the world, perhaps the greatest perfume that there ever will be. He made it and knows every ingredient in it and all the work he had to go through to accomplish its creation. The people, his audience, love him for it. But they <em>don't know that</em>. They adored him because they thought he was a prince, an innocent, a gorgeous man. They didn't have a reason; they simply felt that way. They had no inkling of his genius. They respected him because of the perfume, but not on account of it. Grenouille created a masterpiece, a meisterwerk, a capolavoro. But because he was the only one that fully understood it...he was the only one that could appreciate it. And, ironically, he was the only person that it wouldn't work upon. He couldn't experience the effect that it had on others.

He was artist with no audience and, perhaps even worse, an artist with no other art to enjoy. No further inspiration in life. So then what is there to live for?

3) IS FEMINISM GONNA HAFTA CHOKE A BITCH (BACK)?

Of course, let's just remember what Grenouille's masterpiece consisted of: the scents of 25 of the most beautiful (read: good-smelling), virgin, adolescent women Grenouille had ever smelt. In <em>Das Parfum</em> virgin, adolescent girls are the epitome of beauty (smell). Hmmmm, Grenouille. Hmm.

When Grenouille is little he does not aesthetically differentiate between smells. Smells simply are. It is only when he smells the first beautiful girl he had ever smelt does he understand that there are good smells and bad smells, that there is a higher form to which he must reach. It is how he chooses creativity as his calling. He follows the scent and finds her - she has green eyes and red hair - she is peeling fruit - she is alone - he chokes her to death. Then he strips her and smells her head to toe.

Much later on, when he has the means to distill the scents of humans, he goes after 24 young girls, but the one he had to wait two years for was also green-eyed and redhaired. He uses the analogy of the flower, which is ever fitting, since he works with a lot of flowers for his other perfumes. He needed to wait until she was a full bud, but before she completely <em>bloomed</em>. Her father knew the profile of the girls who were getting killed, so he looked to marry her off quickly so that she would no longer be a virgin, and therefore no longer fit the profile. He fails, of course, but what cannot be overlooked is all of this is completely sexual without it being <em>physically</em> sexual. She must remain a virgin to be beautiful/smell the best possible. The flower...cannot...open. Get it? Yeah. It doesn't take a rocket scientist.

However, we could write all of this off as being Grenouille's personal taste. There aren't too many other scent-geniuses in the world we could compare him to, are there? And yet, and yet. When Grenouille puts on the perfume in public, we are told that it is the best perfume in the world. <em>E</em><em>veryone </em>reacts to it. Women fall in love with him. Men want to be him. Children think he is a Maerchenprinz- a prince out of a fairy tale. He exudes beauty, and innocence. He starts a fucking orgy! This is what turns people on both in love and in lust! Let's throw these words around again: <em>Form. Epitome. Paragon.</em> So are we to think that the epitome of human beauty is adolescent, female, virgin innocence? Is it really, Patrick S&uuml;skind? IS IT REALLY?

There's no one in this book whom anyone should take as an example of goodness, so there're no real sexist complaints there. And really, there's only so much women could accomplish in those days as well. But let's list off the females mentioned in this book, shall we? The mother, herself a killer. The wetnurse, who falls into the 'mystical woman' trope who senses the devil in Grenouille. The woman who runs the orphanage. Baldini's wife, who doesn't do much of anything. Arnulfi, who, while a savvy business woman, is mostly mentioned in the context of having sex with the man who works in her shop, and who ends up marrying him. And of course, all the adolescent girls that Grenouille kills out of aroma-lust. None of them <em>do</em> anything. It's just really frustrating.

More than that, I really just rage against the idea that there's one form that is beauty itself. Sure, it works within the context of the book, that there's one thing that Grenouille is striving towards, but it's just more of the same bullshit to me. I mean, there's a reason Disney markets their stars as virgin, law-abiding members of the society. It's who you're supposed to want to be. It's who you're supposed to want to marry. You can want to have a tumble in the hay with whatever starlet is flashing her ass at the VMAs or whatever, but what kind of person do people think about when they want someone to, well, want forever? A Disney Cinderella? A Disney Sleeping Beauty?

Which leads us to our next category.

4) THE POSTMODERN FAIRY TALE

The only way I feel I can really overlook what I believe to be a senseless rehashing of the innocent girl as victim, is if the author is trying to in some way recreate the stories that are really at the foundation of our culture. And by that I basically mean fairy tales from the Grimms onward.

Way back in the day, when mythology was still quite the same as fairy tale, boys were lusted after as well as girls. Sure, you had your Io and your Europa and your Daphne, but you also had your Adonis and your Ganymede. Once we reach the Grimms at the beginning of the 19th century, girls and boys often make very different sorts of protagonists in fairy tales. Very rarely are they as helpless and innocent as the girls, whose virtues are beauty and kindness. Often the male protagonists are described as dumb and oblivious. That is their sort of innocence.

The girls are obvious in their role. But let's take a look at Grenouille. Because Grenouille kills the girls, that automatically makes him the villain, doesn't it? Sure. There are certainly parallels one can draw between the perfumer and and fairy tale figures such as Bluebeard and the Robber-Bridegroom. They kill young women and often keep tokens of them. In <em>Das Parfum</em>, not only does Grenouille steal their scents, but he keeps their clothing and their hair, because they will maintain the scent for a long time after the body, which created the smell, begins to rot. At the end of most fairy tales, the villain undergoes terrible punishment. They get lynched or tried in court; they get put in barrels or pits with vipers' they dance on coals until they die. A common death is being ripped apart and eaten by wild animals. Grenouille? He gets ripped apart by people and eaten when he douses himself with the entire bottle of the masterperfume.

That's really only looking at the book on the surface, however. The boy's name is Grenouille. What is the first fairy tale in every Grimm collection you buy? What is Disney finally adding to their horrid rehash repertoire? <em>The Frog Prince</em>. Or really, in the original German, the <em>Frog-King</em>. In the story, the frog basically stalks the youngest of the princesses, a little girl. He forces her to feed him from her plate, and to let him sleep in her bed. He finally turns into a prince when she throws him against the wall, and more or less kills him. With bloodshed, in other words.

As I mentioned before, frogs are famous for their very obvious life stages. In <em>Das Parfum</em>, Grenouille also has obviously delineated life stages. At the end of each major point in his life, he causes someone to die. Sometimes this is unintentional, and sometimes it is not. His mother is tried in court and killed for being a baby killer after giving birth to him and leaving him for dead. The tanner, Grenouille's first master, dies after selling Grenouille to Baldini and drinking with his newfound money. Baldini dies when his house falls into the river the day after Grenouille leaves- when before he had met Grenouille, he was getting ready to move out of that house. Grenouille's acquaintance with a scientist convinces him his hairbrained ideas are right and he dies on account of his whacky science. When Grenouille uses his masterperfume, someone else gets blamed for killing the girls and is then executed in his stead. Just as the frog needs to die in order for the prince to live, people needed to die in order for Grenouille to live.

Perhaps even more surprisingly, Grenouille follows the pattern of <em>female</em> fairy tale protagonists. Cinderella isn't the only girl who has to grow up in a life of labor; in fact, many of them do. Grenouille grows up an orphan in a loveless childhood, and works extremely hard, not only at the tanner's, but also for the perfumers. Another step that many girls take in fairy tales is many years - often 3 or 7 or one of the 'mystical numbers' - of exile. This can take place either in the wild or in a small cabin or what have you. In the middle of the book, Grenouille leaves Paris and puts himself in exile. He lives in a cave for seven years, separating himself from the rest of humanity.

And in the end, where's the fairy tale happy ending? Is Grenouille the royalty, the villain, or the newly-wedded princess? Effectively, he is all three. He is ripped to shreds and eaten: he is the villain. He is saved/saves himself from a life he does not want: he is the prince. He brings love to people's lives, who did not have love, and in the process wins his peace: he is the princess.

How does he bring love? He gets eaten by criminals, whores, the homeless, poorest of the poor. These people ask for nothing and give nothing. And yet, because of the nature of the perfume, it causes them to love. And lo, they love and desire him so much, that they each want a piece of him, and take that piece inside them.

To be honest, I wasn't really expecting to spin that view, either. When I was reading the description of the cannibalism I wasn't all that bothered, because that was what I was expecting. What I was not expecting was the last line: &quot;Sie hatten zum ersten Mal etwas aus Liebe getan.&quot; <em>They had, for the first time, done something out of love</em> (my translation). That was really a punch in the gut for me. I would rank it the third best ending line of a book I've ever read, in fact. It's sort of what made an inevitable ending that was just going to be a relief for me, into something almost...happy. And I certainly believe that that was the author's intent, in some way or another. He was born right next to that place where he died, and because he died there he actually made it...better. Intriguing, intriguing.
</lj-cut>
<strong>Final Verdict:</strong> A must read. The film version, with Dustin Hoffman (who I would guess is the Baldini character....?) and Alan Rickman (perhaps the father of the last girl?), is definitely next on my netflix list. But I really, really can't imagine anyone making a good movie out of this book. It's a medium that is exclusively visual and auditory; no real sense of the olfactory at all. Reading allows you to imagine all the senses. Well...that will be a review for another day.

<u><strong><em>The Road</em> by Cormac McCarthy</strong></u>

Written in 2006, <em>The Road</em> is about a father and son trying to survive in a grey and desolate post-apocalyptic world. They do not have names, and I actually didn't really notice that until about halfway through the book. They don't need them. They are us and we are them, struggling to keep on keeping on in a world of forgetfulness, grief, and hardship.

This book is almost 300 pages, but as I said before, I read it during my downtime at work. In one shift. So it's a really quick read. That doesn't mean it's an <em>easy</em> read or a <em>light</em> read, simply, a quick one. I...liked it more than I thought I would. I certainly appreciate it more than I thought I would. It's just really not my bag. But the film is coming out soon and I suppose I need to broaden my literary horizons, so I read it. It made me think, though, and that's the best praise you can give any work of art.

<lj-cut text=""spoilers here too"">1) WHAT IF?

Most post-apocalyptic crap is there for the oo's and the ah's. It's like a different form of disaster movie Hollywood; it basically ignores the true horror of the situation to give thrills to the consumer. Not so with <em>The Road</em>. Here, the focus is not the massive destructive events that brought the world to the point it is when the story begins. Explosions are vaguely mentioned in a flashback, but in the end, it doesn't really matter. What matters is that it's several, perhaps a dozen years in the aftermath of this undoubtedly man-made catastrophe, and a father and his son are travelling south during the onset of winter.

It's really hard to say how accurate it is in terms of survival skills and I suppose one couldn't say what would be left over if one doesn't know exactly what happened in the first place. That being said, I think it's fairly realistic in terms of all that could go wrong and what you'd need to do to stay alive. It is...horrifying what becomes of society. Basically, groups of cannibals go around and keep a harem of women and catamites in tow. More or less. Because there's no other real way to make food, since all the ground is ruined and stores of canned food and such are nearly gone due to it being so many years after the fact. Then there are smaller groups of cannibals, and finally a few wanderers, like the father and son, who don't eat people and try to live the best life they can, retaining what morals they can. Morals of a dead society.

It isn't easy, of course. I give McCarthy all props for this. There wasn't one point in the book where I thought the struggle of mind was any less harrowing than the physical fight for survival.

This is a 'what if' scenario <em>that works</em>. It sort of comes in a set; <em>1984</em> wasn't any fun for me to read, but people absolutely need to read political dystopias like that in order to prevent it from happening. Likewise, people should read a book like <em>The Road</em> to understand the full consequences of their actions in politics and war. This obviously wasn't an Apocalypse in the biblical sense. It was brought about man.

The bastards.

2) GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES

I read this book straight after reading a 600-some page book in Italian and then a 300-some page book in German. For the first page, I was practically in the throes of orgasm because it was ENGLISH. And I hadn't really realized how much I'd missed it. Then, the truth started trickling in. That is:

-mostly shorter sentences
-longer sentences have no commas
-no quotation marks around speech
-no apostrophes in certain contractions

There are basically two reactions I have to this. I'm pretty torn between them, because I have no frame of reference. Does Cormac McCarthy write like this in his other books? I don't know. If so, he really pisses me off. If not, then...I get it. If he's only using grammar in this way for <em>The Road</em>, then I accept that. There's no denying it adds something.

The world is grey and barren. So is the page. There's no extra punctuation- this signifies no extra baggage. Why have long sentences, and when you have them, why have commas? Commas are there to take a pause, a breath. There's no need to waste breath. There's no resting in this world.

The contractions in which he uses no apostrophes are as follows: cant, didnt, wont, dont, etc. When I first noticed this a couple pages in, I thought it was all words that required apostrophes, but no- only contractions, and only <em>negative</em> contractions. From a linguistic point of view, this is telling. That is, they are spoken so often that they are no longer considered two words, but one. Cant. Dont. Wont. *shivers* It's really the details that flesh out the painting...

It's not too bad of an assumption to make that McCarthy did this on purpose, because he does make up words ot put in the new vernacular, as would happen in such a situation. The one I can think of from the top of my head is &quot;roadagents,&quot; for the cannibals who go around in trucks on the old highways and kidnap people and shit.

3) DESCRIPTORS

The land is black. The sea is grey. The sky switches between the two. The language, as previously stated, is sparse, succinct, as barren as the place it describes. In a colorblind world, you yearn for the mentions of faded hues and half-forgotten memories. I found myself lapping up metaphors whenever he used them, drinking them in as if parched. Leading an existence of toil, an existence completely in the present, living 'miticamente' as it were, the father could barely allow himself to think much of the world as it was. The boy himself was too young to remember. So even then, the father couldn't mention much because there were so many things the boy wouldn't understand. As he admitted to himself, analogies no longer have meaning if their referents no longer exist.

But when such thoughts sneak through, but when, oh, did they hurt to read. An example:

<em>The old man shook his head from side to side, his fingers laced in his filthy hair. The boy looked up at his father.

Maybe he thinks we're not real.

What does he think we are?

I dont know.

We cant stay here. We have to go.

He's scared, Papa.

I dont think you should touch him.

Maybe we could give him something to eat.

He stood looking off down the road. Damn, he whispered. He looked down at the old man. Perhaps he'd turn into a god and they to trees. All right, he said.

</em>Just...just...guh. It's one sentence, and it says so much. It's another piece of evidence that the father was a well-educated man; in this case, he knew mythology. It could refer to several things, but this is probably an allusion to Ovid's <em>Metamorphoses</em>. Also, it's chock full of false hope. He wants to do what's right, but also what's good by his son, both mentally - by helping the man - and physically - by not helping the man. It could be a trap, too. It's a hard decision to make, but make one he must. It's not that he actually believes the man could turn into a god, but so much has happened, so many strange things, why not this, why not this end if any other, why not honor the underlying lesson of the myth to do good, why not choose to die in doing an act of kindness instead of an act of horror? Oh, one sentence, and I nearly cried right there at work.

After all, that myth has been around for thousands of years. Why not let it still be valid post-apocalypse?

4) EVERYONE IS A PHILOSOPHER AND A PROPHET

McCarthy writes: <em>The hundred nights they'd sat up debating the pros and cons of self destruction with the earnestness of philosophers chained to a madhouse wall.</em> McCarthy writes: <em>There is no God and we are his prophets.</em>

The former is said in reference to the father and his wife whilst telling the story of how and why the mother killed herself. The latter is said by the aforementioned old man, who, whilst admitting that's not his real name, tells them to call him Ely (which in my head I pronounced like &quot;Eli&quot; and not like Ely, MN. You know, Eli, as in God, and various biblical figures).

In <em>Flashfoward</em>, after nearly everyone has had a vision of the future, Aaron says, &quot;We're all prophets now.&quot; But he means that more in the sense of prophecy- having seen the future, and telling it. In <em>The Road</em>, it is used in the religious sense. That is, this person has been touched by what is divine, and they wander, and walk the roads in poverty, live in the desert and fast, and spread the news. What Ely is saying is that they've seen God and he is Nothing. And so they wander, and walk the roads in poverty, and starve, and spread <em>nothing</em>. Why carry on? Why do anything? Why live at all?

As I'd mentioned before, the mental anguish is done simply and exquisitely. For me, discovering the theories of philosophy led to some of the greatest pain of my life- mental pain, that became physical. Of course, it works the other way too; having felt pain in my life, I have considered elements of philosophy that I probably wouldn't give two shits about otherwise. So the father is stuck in this sort of limbo physically and mentally, a never-ending cycle of torment where the pain feeds the philosophy feeds the pain. In the end, part of the reason he keeps carrying on and suffering is because there's no real conclusion to come to. You carry on because you do. Because you must. Because, as his mantra to his son goes, &quot;We're carrying the fire.&quot;

I've thought about this phrase that he uses, and it doesn't even have to be in reference to Prometheus. Man learning how to make fire was his first step to becoming civilized. It is the symbol of as well as being light and warmth. It is often the only splash of color in their grey world, at times red and orange; yellow and blue. It is passion. It is life.

After the boy's father dies, he runs into another man, who's part of a family that's been watching him. The first question the child asks him, of course, is whether he's &quot;one of the good guys.&quot; Before the man responds, he looks up into the sky, though there's nothing to see- an old habit of the deceased father. This is of course significant in all the metaphorical ways. Lofty heights. Something else out there beyond the earth. Gods that don't exist. Philosophical thoughts.

The second question the boy asks is whether he's carrying the fire. But of course, we already know. The boy goes with them.

I...am on the fence as to whether or not this is a happy ending. Certainly it's the best ending one could have hoped for after reading that bleak narrative. Maybe the boy and his new siblings will grow up to make a difference. Maybe by then the world will have started to heal. We don't know. But I find it unlikely. On the other hand...it's maybe to give us hope, that even with all the pain, even with everyone giving in to murder and destruction and the worst of our animal instincts...some of us will still be, at the core, <em>good</em>. So much will be lost, but not everything.

But preferably, let's not get to that point in the first place, eh?
</lj-cut>
<strong>Final Verdict: </strong>Well-executed, but not the best read. If you're into those kinds of &quot;what if&quot; scenarios, then you couldn't really ask for a better example. If you're looking for something that will fufill you, then...no. Though I <em>did</em> really enjoy drinking warm, delicious soup after I finished reading it. That's for sure. Anyway, I look forward to seeing what Viggo does with the piece when the movie comes out...next week is it? Indeed, I shall spend my money on it.

Other comments, having no real review value and mostly on a personal note:

<em>Das Parfum</em>: So, that nightmare it inspired? I was Grenouille. Not literally, I mean, but I was in his position. I, for whatever stupid, pointless, dream-logic reason, was wearing his masterperfume. I was driving in a car, and I was covered in green paint (Reznor's <em>Deep</em> music video, anyone?) and wearing the masterperfume. People started chasing me so I was trying to escape. I turned onto a major road and started gunning it, but then all of the oncoming traffic in the other lane started to slow down and stop. It was night, and their headlights were glaring. Semis, cars, trucks. <em>Shit</em>, I thought. <em>Don't get out of the car. Keep driving</em>. But what the fuck do I do? I park the car in a dark parking lot and get out of the car. Because I'm an idiot. I started running away, and there were some people in the distance behind me. But suddenly, a girl jumps out into my path and starts slashing at me with a knife. I back off a little and we circle each other a bit. Finally, when I think she's going to lunge to get a piece of me, I start to use the perfume and ordered her around. Sort of like...if I got her occupied, she wouldn't try to hurt me. She didn't want to follow my commands, she <em>knew</em> that she was being coerced, but she couldn't help but love me and do it anyway. It was just a really awful situation all around and finally, <em>finally</em> I became lucid and woke myself up. Because <em>no</em>.

<em>The Road</em>: I know this is because I've been much too involved in the <em>Star Trek</em> fandom lately, but I couldn't help but be convinced that the father was like Dr. McCoy. It's never really stated explicitly in the book, but I'm about 95% certain that he was a doctor, or elsewise somehow involved with medicine. Obviously that profession didn't mean all that much anymore, but it helped when he needed to give himself stitches, etc. It's not just the profession, though. Dr. McCoy is an old-fashioned doctor, a sort of family man that was pulled into a dangerous, space-exporing mission that was both his fault, and not his fault. He is undoubtedly the conscience and compassion of the ship. His wife, the few times she's mentioned, is painted as an ambiguous figure at best, and of course he has a child that he cares for (though in this case, from afar). He doesn't believe in the new technology, and he carries a phaser because he must. Likewise the father must carry a pistol, and he sort of...carries the past with him...as best he can....as much as he dares...when everyone else just moves headlong into the next thing. I think it's actually a somewhat nicer characterization than the father deserves, but because I saw him as a gruff-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside sort of man, a man McCoy could become in the same situation...well...it was that much more painful for me to read. (Not to mention my own father is of the older generation of doctors, not the new ones in it for the prestige and the money...god I hate the current generation of doctors...)"

"event","<br />So I just came across an article saying that a movie has been made about the Donner party.<br /><br />Let's get this straight, okay? Maybe cannibalism is just a squick of mine, since I'm really squicky about meat anyway, but it is NOT an acceptable main element of a film.<br /><br />But what about <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>? you ask, and yeah, yeah I hear ya. The difference between <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> and a historical epic about a bunch of people eating their loved ones is plot. The former is about a serial killer and the agent who's working against him. We have someone to root for, and the hope that the killer will get taken down in the end. He's just a fucked up guy who likes to fuck with people, and some audience members love getting fucked with and squicked out. While this is not me, I get it. I get why people love <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> and its lame-ass sequels.<br /><br />And yet! A movie about the Donner party cannot be anything like that. Sure we laughed when Robin Williams said, &quot;Donner, party of four!&quot; whilst moving a skeleton's jaw, but that sort of joke falls under the category of &quot;too soon,&quot; after it's not &quot;too soon&quot; anymore. We all know the outcome of their fateful trip. How much they suffered. How completely unimaginable for us it must have been. But they lived it. THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE. They froze and died and ate each other because some fucking dumbass duped them into taking a 'shortcut' through the mountains. What the fuck lesson is there to be learned except not to trust people when they say they &quot;totally know&quot; a shortcut? SO WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT IT? I emphatically <em>do not</em>&nbsp;accept the reasoning that it's for people who love depressing movies or want to be squicked out.<br /><br />Therefore, since the first five minutes have been officially released online, I decided to watch it. I needed to know how they were treating the subject matter. I was pleased to see that they were treating it with all due seriousness, but that's pretty much the only thing I was pleased about. It began with the opening credits, the names scrawled next to sketches of Independence, MO and various landmarks along the Oregon Trail. It already made me sick thinking of what they had to go through to get that far. Then the movie proper began with a sort of intro typed over a snowy mountain background about how they left Missouri in 1864(?) yadda yadda yadda, and how they were now stuck! And then a dude showed up and started voice-over narrating whilst making a fire! Do you get this? Are you reading this? IT STARTS WITH THEM ALREADY STUCK IN THE GODDAMN MOUNTAINS. It's not like <em>Titanic</em>&nbsp;where they can make a funny or two with their bad scriptwriting before the disaster strikes! Oh no! We're starting in media res, LOVELY.<br /><br />There were a couple minutes left, but I had to shut it off. I seriously felt like I was going to puke up the food I just ate, even though there was no meat involved in my dinner. Just...no.<br /><br />And then, they're remaking <em>Short Circuit</em>. I remember that film. It was a favorite of my childhood. Ergo, it is too new to be remade.<br /><br />Why, movie industry? Why?"

"event","<br />&quot;D:&quot; has been my favorite emoticon for a while now. &quot;:(&quot; is just sort of sad or disappointed, and variations on &quot;:o&quot; are more shocked or surprised. But &quot;D:&quot;, ever since I first saw it, has perfectly expressed everything on the Horror Spectrum, from dismay, to disgust, to ineffable terror. I loves it, precious. When a couple of enterprising writers titled one of their stories as simply, &quot;D:&quot;, I was no little intrigued. And the story lived up to its labelling: I suffer from sometimes-paralyzing secondhand embarrassment, and for most of the story I was torn in two from convulsions of both laughter and horror. Indeed, throughout most of my reading, my countenence was contorted thusly: &quot;D:&quot;. Not only did one of the characters regularly get referred to as wearing his, what was dubbed, &quot;D-face,&quot; said emoticon also eloquently expressed the &quot;FML&quot; road the protagonist's life&nbsp;was taking. So clearly, &quot;D:&quot; has range.<br /><br />So I think that story is the eptiome of that emoticon. Little did I know that last night, I would have a dream that was an epitome of that icon. To wit:<br /><br />I'm not sure how the dream got to this point, but some bad guy was after me or something, and he was all about alligators. I don't think it was magic and they were his animal to call or anything, he was just obsessed with them, I don't know. Anyway, the authorities has procedures for these types of bad guys, because obviously, all bad guys have favorite animals, and so they put me outside near a lake that had a gigantic-ass alligator in it. They assured me that they'd neutralized the alligator somehow, and it wouldn't be able to hurt me. RIGHT. Every time I got in the water, it totally started coming toward me. But I kept trying. The last time, it was chilling on the shore, I jumped in, pushed away from the bank, and started kicking quickly away, sort of like a backstroke without the arms. Immediately I knew it was the wrong thing to have done, because it could totally catch up to me in the water. And indeed, it speedily slipped into the water and made a beeline for me.<br /><br />D:<br /><br />At this point I regained some lucidity and redirected the dream (I'm often able to do this when I'm about to get killed). Suddenly, I was inside the grand brick building that was on the same property as the Alligator Lake. It was like a hostel, sort of. But a nice one! Homey and cozy and sort of like tiny restaurants you see in Little Italys around the States. There were definitely traces to the one we often go to in Cleveland. Anyway, I was there along with my mother and on of my sisters. The place was pretty crowded. However, the place, which was sort of more like a hotel, I guess, because there was a wedding party upstairs making a shittonne of racket and demanded all the attention of the owners for the preparation and all the guests and whatnot. This put everybody else in a pissy mood. But that was okay, because I could entertain my family. Because obviously, this was FERRARA, and I am an expert. Indeed, the top floor of the cozy/hotel/hostel/thing was apartments, and my apartment had been one of them. I would take everybody up to see it! Share that important bit of my life! No one cared. They rolled their eyes, because clearly, no idea was more ridiculous on earth.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""font-size: small"">D:</span></strong><br /><br />So I tried to take them around shopping in the district but there were slim pickings because it's sort of a small place. We return to the hotel where my sister laments the pointless trip outside we had just taken. Then I get a brilliant idea! I would take her to Venice! Venice wasn't that far away! It was filled with shiny things like masks with jewels and feathers! She would love it! I voiced my enthusiasm and gave my assurance that it would be awesomesauce. My sister gave me one of those, &quot;Oh, my annoying little sibling&quot; looks, said, &quot;Yeah, maybe,&quot; in a manner which clearly meant NO, turned her back, and walked away.<br /><br /><span style=""font-size: large"">D:</span><br /><br />I was at a complete loss. Who wouldn't want to explore the wonders of new places and things? Didn't everybody want to see Venice? My family's dreamed about doing stuff like this forever, and here I was offering it to them on a platter, but they didn't seem to care at all. They didn't appreciate it at all. They didn't want me to share. I returned to our hotel room, which was empty. I stood between the little white beds and looked out the window, directly onto Alligator Lake, lamenting the state of affairs. Then the woman who owned the place with her husband walked in. We knew each other from my time studying in Ferrara. She apologized that all her guests' stays weren't the best because of all the wedding stuff going on. I was so relieved that there was someone else in the world that I knew that appreciated the places and things that were around us, and that spoke Italian, and that was, I don't know, talking to me, that&nbsp;I threw my arms around this woman and cried.<br /><br /><span style=""font-size: x-large"">D:</span><br /><br />Then my mother came in. My mother is always in a sour mood when things at hotels aren't <em>just so</em>, and this was obviously no exception. Then the owner-woman whipped out the coup de grace: all the dinner reservations for the hotel dining room had just been cancelled because the wedding party had demanded that all of their people should eat in the dining room that eve. Then she left, and I could see my mother getting really angry. But I knew JUST the thing to render this situation awesome! &quot;Don't worry, mother,&quot; I told her. &quot;There are a lot of great places to get cappellacci around here. I know just where we can go!&quot; My mother turned and looked down her nose at me disdainfully. &quot;I don't want cappellacci,&quot; she spat, in a tone which clearly screamed, PLEBE PICKINGS.<br /><br /><strong><span style=""font-size: xx-large"">D:</span></strong><br /><br />At which point I became lucid, said AH, FUCK NO! and forced myself to wake up fully. Honestly, I get lucid in dreams when really awful things are happening. Like, I'm dying or about to, or people around me are, etc. That was the extent of the mindfuck that was this dream. It was so <em>emotionally</em> violent that I became lucid. It was so turbulent to my state of being that it took me a good half an hour to fall back asleep, even though I was really tired.<br /><br />My subconscious is always so full of surprises."

"event","<br />It's been a while since I've had a full time job that isn't &quot;being a student.&quot; So...I'd sort of forgotten how much time it just eats up...I am so incredibly behind on everything! I need a couple more hours in the day, or something. But when I opened up the envelope with my paystub in it and I saw the amount, I just about cried. I'd forgotten what it felt like to not worry about how many groceries you're buying. I mean, I made more money in two weeks than I've had in my bank account since I returned from Italy. Probably from halfway through my sojourn living in Italy. Of course, I start paying back college loans this month! It's going to take the rest of my life! For joy! For exultation and joy!<br /><br />I shall share what I've been up to in my offtimes, but first, a couple conversations with my mother:<br /><lj-cut text=""Thermostats, Bush, and Animal Body Parts""><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> The thermostat isn't working.<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> What's wrong with it?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> It's been stuck on the same temperature. It won't get any lower.<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>*has been shivering since having returned from work* Well what is it?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Sixty-nine.<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> ...And what do you have it set at?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Sixty-five. Why won't it get any cooler?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>It does not feel like sixty-nine in the house. Also, did you ever stop to think that maybe this is the ambient temperature, and the house won't get any colder unless you put on the air conditioning?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u>: ...Houses shouldn't be this warm. *stomps upstairs*<br /><br />I think we can all draw our own biological conclusions from this conversation. Conversation #2:<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> I've been watching the first season of <em>NCIS</em>! Your sister let me borrow it. Did you know she has it?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Yes. I bought it for her birthday last Christmas. You were there.<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>: </strong>Oh! Well, I watched the first episode, and guess who's in it?! President Bush!<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Really? Which one?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> ...I just told you. The pilot. The first episode.<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>Yeah, I&nbsp;got that. I mean who was it?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>: </strong>...The President!<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> ...Which. One.<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>: </strong>PRESIDENT BUSH!<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>WHICH BUSH?!<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Oh! Junior.<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> THANK YOU.<br /><br />Also, my sister informs me it was for a split second and not actually the president, but a look-alike or film voodoo or something. My mother, however, still staunchly believes that the man who was the President of the US at the time of filming decided to make room in his busy schedule to appear for less than a minute on the pilot episode of a show that may or may not have succeeded, or indeed, even been picked up by the studio. Right. Last but not least, my favourite to date:<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Are you going out?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Yes.<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> For how long?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> I don't know.<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> With whom?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>: </strong>Mother, who do I always hang out with?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>: </strong>Well what are you guys going to do?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Sacrifice a bull to the great god Zeus.<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>: </strong>Well what are you going to do with the bull's balls?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> ...What?<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>: </strong>You said you were going to sacrifice a bull. So what's going to happen to its balls?<br /><br /><u><strong>me</strong></u><strong>:</strong> *blinks* I'll save them and bring them home for you.<br /><br /><u><strong>mother</strong></u><strong>:</strong> Don't say things like that! That's disgusting!<br /><br />Yeah, I just walked out the door after that statement. Because she started talking about a dead bull's balls and then she had the gall to say that I should watch <em>my</em> mouth? Riiiiight. And also, WHAT IS MY MOTHER DOING TALKING ABOUT THE TESTICLES OF BOVINES? WHY?<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />Anyway!<br /><br /><strong>WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO:<br /><br /></strong><lj-cut text=""Books, Bubblewrap, and Impulse Buying"">- Reading <em>The Redemption of Althalus</em> by David and Leigh Eddings. Or should I say...<em>La redenzione di Althalus</em>? That's right. My second week in Italy I walked into a used bookstore to look for cheap textbooks and found one of the most beloved stories of my childhood in Italian. I've been missing my foreign languages hardcore, and what better way to keep in touch with them than by reading in them? I'd completely forgotten why I loved the book so much when I read it, and now it's no wonder why I love it. The goddess, the thief, the soldier, the priest, the monarch, the witch, the boy prodigy&nbsp;- linguistics, anthropology, religious crises - all wrapped up in a fun, clever, and wonderfully sarcastic fantastical package. It's nice to know that even when I was brainwashed by catholicism and going to elementary school, I still had some good taste.<br /><br />- Writing my delightful, delightful parody. Am I crossing too many lines when it's basically a parody of a semi-parody political and critical musical AND it's fanfiction? I DON'T KNOW. But I'm loving it. It's thrilling! Chilling! And fulfilling! Of course, work has been keeping me away from it, but I have off tomorrow, and if I don't finish it, or at least get a good ways along, I'm going to be mightily upset.<br /><br />- Going through shit in my room. Because really. I have a lot of bubblewrap lying everywhere. It's getting kind of old. Once again, not really a lot of time due to work.<br /><br />- Tomorrow...or today, really...I'm going out to lunch with a friend I haven't seen in, I&nbsp;think, well over a year. Then I&nbsp;have an appointment to go edit something. I don't get to sleep in on my day off :(<br /><br />- This weekend I bought little statuettes of both Anubis and Bastet, my first divine loves. I truly used to read book after book about Egyptian mythology back in 6th grade. Hey, it's a good investment! I saw them, and still wanted them about 3 hours later...so I bought them.<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><strong>WHAT I'M ABOUT TO BE DOING:<br /><br /></strong><lj-cut text=""Curses and Lit and the Idiot Box"">- PAYING STUDENT LOANS.<br /><br />- This Saturday the family and I are going down to Arseholeofnowhere, South Dakota to see an exhibit with artifacts from King Tut's tomb. Yeah, I wrote a paper in sixth grade about the Curse on the Tomb and the Golden Canary and the Dying and Whatnot. THE CURSE THAT ANUBIS SET. (I love my statuettes. I do, I do, I do.) After which I will return home and pull my overnight shift at work. Ugh.<br /><br />- Making a goddamn list of stories I have 'in progress' and begin to check some shit off. Why? Clearing the slate for NaNo. That's right. I'm about 80% on board with that right now. This includes the ever-elusive ending to <em>Ents</em>.<br /><br />- I have in fact already made a list of all the TV shows that I watch but have now fallen behind on, along with a couple I want to start watching. I'm not even touching my 'must-see movies' list. Not probably for another few months. *wipes forehead* Whew. Who knows how long that is.<br /><br />- Since I've been reading a 600-or-so-page book in Italian these past couple weeks during my downtime at work, I begin next with German novels! <em>Das Parfum</em> is at the top of my list right now, followed by <em>Der Vulkan</em>. However, if I get my hands on it soonishly, <em>Tintenherz</em> will be at the top of my list like whoa. Because, you know....postmodern lit, autobiographical fiction, and children's fantasy is a pretty good mix, yeah?<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><strong>AWESOME MOVIE AND TV NEWS:<br /><br /></strong><lj-cut text=""Grave Robbers, Gucci, and STEPHEN FRY"">- David Tennant and Simon Pegg to star in film together as grave robbers. Can this be any more perfect? *swoon*<br /><br />- <em>The Road</em>&nbsp;is finally coming out after being pushed back for ages. I guess I'll have to read that before I go to see it. I can't wait to see Viggo on the screen again...early reviews are favourable!<br /><br />- Zachary Quinto and Brad Paisley to produce show for the CW about an up-and-coming country singer. WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK. Really? Really? The CW? Country music? Not computing here.<br /><br />- Ridley Scott is making a movie about the Gucci family? And Angelina Jolie is in talks to play the murderous wife or something? Seriously, guys? Can we stop with these kinds of movies? I'd be ever so grateful.<br /><br />- <u>STEPHEN FRY</u> IS WRITING THE SCRIPT FOR THE NEXT <u>PETER JACKSON</u> FILM. *falls upon the ground and kisses it fervently* I love the earth. The earth brings forth such wonderful things. But also, Peter: when in the hell are you going to get on those Her Majesty's Dragon movies? Because I want to see your weirdo close-ups on people's faces during epic and dramatic scenes, goddamn.<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />And yeah...tha's all for now. See, I am so behind on my friends list and my news sites and my email that after getting home from work and making dinner and not even getting done with the several pages of posts I've missed, it's already after 5am. I am so screwed for getting up in time for lunch.<br /><br />....But then again, I now have the money to buy myself lunch!<br /><br />Lastly, I had a strange dream last night. Usually I dream strangely, but this was even more strange because generally my dreams don't include characters and/or famous people. Now, I have never been in the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> fandom. I love the first movie, hate the second, and amusedly tolerate the third. Yet in this dream, a great adventure was taking place, and Will and Captain Jack and Elizabeth were all there among the shenanigans. As&nbsp;I was involved in said adventure, I was watching the dynamic between all of them, and then eventually Will does something stupid and single-minded and heroic per usual, saving Elizabeth's life gallantly, when he glances back toward Sparrow. And then my dreamself got it, in that sort of, &quot;Oh. Oh! Ohhhhhh.&quot;-type way. Yeah...so my subconcious ships Will/Jack. Unrequited, even. Angsty. Not being able to go against the status quo. WHY, FREUD, WHY? I don't even find either of them very attractive! I can't even blame it on my libido!<br /><br />I need sleep."

"event","<br />So....a sequel to the Laramie Project has been written. And it's being performed in LA. And....because it's LA and not NYC, tons of awesome actors that I&nbsp;recognize and respect are going to be in it...from <em>Heroes</em>&nbsp;and <em>NCIS</em> and <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> etc, etc, usw. It's just...ugh. I have always wanted to see the Laramie Project, and now they've got a sequel going on, and I just have this mantra in my head that murmurs <em>soonsoonsoonsoonsoonsoonsoon </em>- SOON I will be somewhere not here, SOON I will be able to enjoy theatre, SOON I will just...have money to be able to go <strong>experience</strong> things.<br /><br />I know I'm lucky and have so much more than most people and there's nothing wrong with working and doing nothing else if working all the time is what helps you to survive, but I can't help it. I'm human. I want. I need. (And because of the different volume and type and origin of the calls, I feel like I'm on an emotional&nbsp; rollercoaster every shift. It wears me the fuck out. Human life is so...predictable and trivial and ultimately <em>sad</em>.)<br /><br /><strong>MAJOR CULTURE WITHDRAWAL.<br /><br /></strong>Getting it through the internet is like...is like mainlining sugar for a high when you're used to crack. 'Sall I'm saying. And the internet can tell me where the venue is and who's going to be there and it will show me a satellite photo of the street if I felt so inclined to search for it, but it can't actually portarmi there.<br /><br />I will...get there...soon. Wherever 'there' is...<em>soon</em>."

"event","<br />I just...I just saw someone advertising NaNoWriMo. Holy shit it's almost Novermber. I mean, I know October just started, but geez. And yeah...it's getting colder out (fall's always been my favorite, but I must admit it's not the same with out those campus trees).<br /><br />This of course has gotten me thinking...should I do NaNo this year? I do type at work all day, but...I have been writing during my downtime at work. This means that I've gotten a dozen or so pages written in the past couple days, which is nice, but it <em>is</em> a parody. A musical parody, in fact. So my dozen pages are actually all the songs that I've rewritten (I have two more left in the musical to go). Which could be seen as lame in one sense, but on the other hand- I just opened up iTunes and it started playing the last song from the musical! So perhaps it's a sign. (What are you talking about? iTunes never lies!)<br /><br />Actually, I've written a lot of parodies. People can't see the tag since I only use it for my fiction, but in my unfinished archive I already have 20 parodies tagged. Natch. Apparently it's an addiction?<br /><br />Though I must admit that my fingers and wrists do hurt. I'm typing really slowly right now, well, slow for me. I tested at 90-some words per minute to get the job and that was super-nervous and making a lot of mistakes, so. This feels like crawling when it's probably like 60 or something. Still.<br /><br />NaNo? I could. I've several long stories I need to write. And maybe if I make it a fanfiction I can post it in relative places and therefore have to post it promptly and on schedule? And now I keep ending sentences with a higher pitch? Like Brian's girlfriend? I'd look for the <em>Family Guy</em>&nbsp;clip but I probably couldn't find it quickly? Anyway I can't keep using homework as an excuse? I can't even use theatre as an excuse?<br /><br />I...should. I need to prove I can finish my long projects when I start them. Because I&nbsp;totally can. I wrote over a hundred pages single-spaced size 10 font in <em>Ents</em> before I petered out. I can finish a long project.<br /><br />Maybe."

"event","They're making a movie about Facebook. <a href=""http://www.aintitcool.com/node/42459"">Really, they are.</a> And I'm not talking about those stupid romcoms where people use the internet to find lovers. Oh, no. About Facebook. The website. Not like a documentary detailing how it came about. That would be too...logical. <br /><br />THERE WILL BE ACTORS PLAYING THE PEOPLE WHO FOUNDED FACEBOOK.

I never felt any longing to go to Orlando, Florida. What I felt, in traveling south to volunteer for the campaign of George W. Bush, was an obligation. Let me explain by first saying something about the critics of our president. A great many of them like to laugh at George Bush for not reading books and for being uninterested in visiting other countries. But a lot of those same people are guilty of the opposite offense. They prefer to read books and travel abroad rather than actually getting to know their own country face to face. 
These critics do a terrific job of mocking his mental deficiencies and dismissing his supporters as hapless morons, but they do not do a very good job of explaining the nature of his support. The few dissident commentators who bother trying to explain the Bush phenomenon seldom do more than reach for the nearest Marx-inspired academic cliche. They will tell you, for instance, that Republicans are a vast intellectual underclass cynically manipulated by the rich through a mesmerizing cocktail of yahoo enthusiasms, xenophobic fears and ancient superstitions -- and those same people will insist, if forced to offer an opinion on the subject, that one should feel sorry for most of them.

This is the wrong approach. As a professional misanthrope, I believe that if you are going to hate a person, you ought to do it properly. You should go and live in his shoes for a while and see at the end of it how much you hate yourself.

This was what I was doing down in Florida. The real challenge wasn't just trying to understand these Republicans. It was to become the best Republican I could be.

Republicans are everywhere, but everywhere is not a good place to look for them. For my purposes I wanted to try to catch them in their ideal habitat. That was why I chose Orlando. For me, it is hell on earth, the worst city on the planet, a place that would make me long for Kinshasa or Volokolamsk. But for Republicans, it is ideal: a scorching-hot paved inland archipelago of garish shopping malls and stadium-size steel-and-glass Baptist churches, a place with no nonhuman life apart from the caged animals at the theme parks, and an entire economy organized around monstrous temples to fake experience.

I arrived in early June, moved into a cheap hotel, called the local Republican office and offered to volunteer. They told me to come on by. So I went, arriving early on a Tuesday morning at their small strip-mall office on the east side of town.

My cover story was a travesty, an idiotic tissue of halfhearted lies. I said I was a New York City schoolteacher named Tom Hamill, in Orlando to spend a summer with a girlfriend who was from the area. It was the best thing I could come up with to explain my Northern accent, my lack of local connections and all that free time.

The story's only saving grace was that the truth was so much more unbelievable. Republicans are paranoid enough to expect a mole from the Kerry campaign, but I was far worse than that -- a dissolute, drug-abusing anarchist who reads the battle diaries of Vietnamese generals on rainy days, roots for Russia at the Olympics and once published an article titled ""God Can Suck My Dick."" I was, in short, the most offensive individual who could conceivably be planted in the campaign of George W. Bush. I was tempted to feel guilty about this. But in the end I figured that it was only fair. Since John Ashcroft has made it easy for FBI agents to infiltrate anti-war groups, it seemed to make sense that an anti-war journalist should infiltrate Ashcroft's party.

Orlando is the crucial city along a stretch of interstate called the I-4 corridor, a swath of central Florida running from Daytona Beach to Tampa. Home to 3.7 million of Florida's 9.3 million registered voters, it has the bulk of the state's undecided voters and is therefore the key to winning Florida's twenty-seven electoral votes. When I got there, I expected a teeming, ultramodern NORAD-style campaign headquarters, where I would have to work my way up a giant totem pole. But in fact what I found was -- nothing at all. For all intents and purposes, there was no campaign for George Bush in Orlando in early June. There was only one paid staffer, a central-Florida field director named Vienna Avelares, and a corner of a table at the local Orange County Republican Executive Committee. If the Republicans were building an electoral Death Star somewhere, it sure as hell wasn't in Florida.

The situation was completely disarming. Vienna, a gregarious Puerto Rican single mother who insisted on introducing herself as ""Vienna -- like the sausage,"" seemed desperate. I had planned on doing a good job anyway, but after meeting her I had a genuine desire to help get things going.

After just a week of coming in every day like this, I became -- along with a young blond Sean Hannity fan named Ben Adrian, who also volunteered at that time -- one of the most important Bush people in all of central Florida. Within a few weeks, we would both be given keys to the office and offered full-time jobs.

Here I want to make a general observation about the social aspect of working for Bush. It's very different than it is working for a Democratic candidate. Corny as this sounds, it is much more egalitarian and brotherly than most Democratic campaigns. Almost every Democratic campaign I've seen has let itself be seduced by the Primary Colors paradigm -- the hip clique full of mildly sexually adventurous twentysomethings who have been working on their memoirs since high school and dream of that chance to wear Versace sport coats and crack jokes on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

If you've ever hung out with the Tricia Enrights and Joe Trippis of the world, you know that the operative vibe of the Democratic insider is wisecracking cool. It is not a reach to say that the ideological vision that mainstream Democratic politics has offered America since Clinton has been the supercool high school, the party of the popular kids. For all the talk about the Democrats being the party of inclusion, it really doesn't feel that way from the inside.

That's not true of all Democrats, of course. I thought it was very different, for instance, in the campaign of Dennis Kucinich. For the most part, these people were motivated by something other than ambition, and just being part of that campaign meant you were in a besieged minority, with the whole world out there laughing at you. Kucinich supporters stuck up for one another, because they had to.

You get that same besieged fraternal feeling in a Republican campaign office. There is no M*A*S*H ensemble-cast repartee. Nobody wears T-shirts that mean something, and nobody looks cool. As I would later find out, most Republicans hate ""cool"" (""They all think they're so cool and artistic,"" griped one woman as she watched Fox coverage of Democratic delegates arriving in Boston). Many of the parent volunteers I met were especially bitter because they think that cool is what liberals use to lure their children away. Which they might very well be right about, of course.

In my first month on the campaign, I did not meet many people who came into the office with the serious intention of working hard for the president. I did, however, meet a great many very lonely people who came in because they knew the Bush offices were the one place where they could share certain deeply held ideas without being ridiculed.

Part of my job, I soon came to understand, was to be supportive when people like portly Tampa sheriff's deputy Ben Mills came in to share their very serious utopian ideas -- like the benefits of having a society guarded by a clone army. ""We'd save a hell of a lot on benefits and medical expenses,"" he said. "" 'Cause you know if they got wounded...""

""You could just shoot them,"" I said.

""Exactly -- pow! Just shoot 'em dead, right in the ground.""

He went on.

""We'd just have a big breeding farm in Colorado,"" he said. ""Course, it'd be a security problem if they got out, you know, if you had rogue clones running around. You'd have to have a special security force to maintain 'em.""

""That's where folks like us would come in,"" I said.

""Exactly,"" he said.

Folks like us. I was getting the hang of it.

In my first six weeks on the campaign, I saw only one black person enter our offices. He was a recently released armed robber from Newark, New Jersey, who was the guest of a local female Republican politician. The ex-con was not particularly interested in Republican politics, although he did say something about wanting to hit Christine Todd Whitman in the face with a brick. I urged him to support the president, even though he couldn't vote. He didn't make any promises.

In mid-July a girlfriend came down from New York to visit me. I recruited her to help me with an idea I'd had to at least temporarily diversify my office environment. We decided that she would pose as a reporter for Vibe magazine, call our offices and ask whoever answered the phone if she could interview our ""black volunteers.""

""Penny"" got my officemate Ben Adrian on the phone, and he instituted a frantic search that lasted several days. We thought at first that we might have a black professor from the University of Central Florida (sixteen miles away) on our volunteer list, but he turned out not to be available. Then Rhyan Metzler, the local Republican Party operative, gave us the number of an elderly man in Sarasota named Johnny Hunter.

As the chairman of the Federation of Black Republicans for the Republican Party of the State of Florida, Johnny was used to being called to this sort of duty. On the phone with ""Penny,"" he explained that his job involved traveling around the state to meet people. ""Wherever they need me,"" he said, ""that's where I be rolling to."" Finally, Ben came through with someone more local. He managed to persuade a thirty-seven-year-old Promise Keeper Christian named Lorin Jones, a phlegmatic fellow who was recovering from two brushes with congestive heart failure, to come in for an interview.

We scheduled it, but ""Penny"" never showed up. I wanted to be there for what I knew would be an excruciatingly awkward situation; the lone black volunteer, dragged into the office to show off to the media, surrounded by a bunch of nervously small-talking white Republicans waiting for the no-show journalist.

Exactly this situation materialized. The bespectacled Lorin sat surrounded by me, Ben and a few other folks from the campaign, and treated this anxious clock-watching crowd to a lesson in the vagaries of black urban existence: ""My dad was a drinker,"" he said. ""He cared about the bottle more than he loved us. But what my mom did was, she worked -- she was there in the afternoon; she wanted to see what we were doing in school.... ""

""Gee,"" mumbled Ben. ""I can't imagine the strength.... I'd like to meet her.""

""I know what it's like to have a parent who'll put a belt on my butt,"" Lorin continued.

Nervous silence. Nods.

A few minutes later, ""Penny"" called to cancel, citing car trouble. Lorin hung in there for a few minutes. Our older volunteer coordinator, Don Madden, came over to chat; the two of them apparently went to neighboring schools in California. Don's school, Don said, was great at basketball, but, he said, winking at Lorin, ""You were probably the only guys who could have beaten us.""

Lorin laughed uncomfortably. ""We were OK,"" he said. ""We were pretty good. Our college was pretty good at basketball.""

Then another staffer came over to say hi. He knew Lorin from past campaigns and asked if Lorin was planning on coming in to do phone banking. Lorin answered that he wasn't, that he was busy setting up a school-supplies giveaway charity event in his neighborhood. The staffer laughed.

""Oh, come on,"" he said jokingly. ""I know how you people don't like to work."" Lorin, who was halfway out the door, stopped at this. His smile disappeared. For a moment, he was genuinely pissed off. ""We don't like to work?"" he said. ""That's all I do is work to make you white Republicans look good.""

The staffer, a jovial guy who I normally liked quite a bit, said nothing and simply slapped Lorin on the back, laughed and helped him out the door.

""Good old Lorin,"" he said, going back to his office.

Vienna also chimed in after Lorin left. The two of them didn't like each other, having once disagreed at a community meeting.

""I don't like that guy,"" she said. Then she explained: ""After that meeting, we really got into it. We were really shouting. He called me a spic. And so I said to him, 'Hey, I may be a spic, but at least I wasn't brought to this country as a slave. I was born here.' ""

""Man,"" I thought, ""We're just one big happy family.""

I ended up getting to know Lorin Jones a little. He was an odd, sincere person who interested me largely because he was by far the most dedicated, effective and intellectually honest Republican volunteer the party had in the area, and yet the campaign more or less completely ignored him.

A devout Christian, Lorin supported Bush not only because of the social-religious issues, but because he sincerely believed that state financial aid had had a corrosive effect on the black community and that communities should support themselves through charity. He was the living incarnation of the ""thousand points of light"" idea. He ought to have been a poster child for Republican values.

""In my neighborhood, you can go up to anybody and ask where the black Republican lives,"" he said. ""And they'll lead you right to my house. But they respect me because of what I've done.""

And I saw this. At a function I would later attend in his neighborhood, I met several people who had been converted to Bush by Lorin. He was working round-the-clock for the president, but the campaign was just trying to turn him into another Johnny Hunter. ""All they want me to do is start clubs,"" he said. ""Tallahassee keeps calling and bugging me to start black clubs. And I hate that, because I think that puts us all in boxes. I think we should be going out into the community more.""

Lorin believed that Republicans could win twenty percent of the black vote -- not the usual ten percent -- if they were smart about it. All they had to do, he said, was visit black churches and hand out fact sheets showing the Republican and Democratic stances on social and religious issues. ""You wouldn't even have to campaign,"" he said. ""You'd get an extra ten percent right there.""

I must have heard him put forward that plan a half-dozen times, but no one did anything except smile and nod.

Some of the Republicans, however, were willing to help Lorin -- sort of. A smallish contingent of five YRs (Young Republicans) met Lorin in front of an Office Depot in a white suburban area one Saturday to man a booth for soliciting school-supply donations for kids in Lorin's neighborhood. They worked cheerfully throughout the afternoon, giving away hot dogs and helping Lorin get a good amount of stuff.

But when it came time a few days later to actually give away the stuff in Lorin's West Orlando neighborhood, none of the YRs showed up. I was the only white Republican who made it. It was a remarkable event. More than 200 people, mostly single mothers and their children, showed up at a funeral home called Gail and Wynn's to receive the book bags and notebooks Lorin had gathered to give away in one of the reception rooms.

I helped distribute bags to the children. ""Vote for Bush,"" I managed to whisper a few times.

That day Lorin confided to me that this might be his last go-round with the Republicans. ""I think this might be it,"" he said. ""I think I might be done with these people.""

During my time on the campaign, I noticed an unusual phenomenon. The more involved a person was with the campaign, the more likely he was to be politically moderate. Most of the core group of our office -- Vienna, Rhyan, Ben, Don -- were quietly pro-choice or socially liberal in some other respect. It was the casual volunteers and the people whose only involvement was a bumper sticker who were likely to rant about liberals being traitors and agents of Islamo-Fascism who should be exiled from the country or jailed, etc.

I saw this clearly one weekend at a local gun show, where we were manning a voter-registration booth. I rotated with Rhyan and Vienna that weekend, and all three of us were quietly freaking out at the sight of all these fat weirdos from the sticks buying huge assault rifles and Confederate bumper stickers with messages such as IF I'D KNOWN THIS WOULD HAPPEN, I'D HAVE PICKED MY OWN COTTON.

""Man, I'm glad I'm a socially liberal Republican,"" whispered Rhyan at one point, laughing.

It was late July, and a new recruit was talking in my ear -- let's call her Susie -- and she was an opinionated, middle-aged fundamentalist-Christian mother of five. Originally from West Virginia, she was working the phones for Bush and sounding off on humanity's declining morals and the agents of the international liberal conspiracy.

""Are you married, Tom?"" she asked.

I squinted in apprehension, sensing a Jesus conversation on the way. ""Uh, no,"" I said.

""My oldest,"" she began, ""has a three-year-old and has been with the same girl for six years, and he will not marry her.""

""Oh,"" I said, remembering to sound shocked. ""That must really upset you.""

""It kills me,"" she said.

""Does he not go to church?""

""Oh, occasionally,"" she said, sighing. ""He will tell you right off.... He encourages her to go and to take their little daughter, and he tells you he's hopeful that God doesn't come, or nothing happens to him before he rededicates his life. But he's definitely not living a life that either honors God or is even pleasing to himself.""

""You should give him those Left Behind books,"" I said solemnly.

I took a deep breath. Throwing out Left Behind -- that runaway best seller in which God comes to earth and literally yanks the believers to heaven, leaving piles of still-warm clothes and dentures behind with the condemned -- was like being a novice wizard and saying a spell for the first time. I wasn't sure it would actually work. It did.

""He won't read 'em,"" Susie answered seriously.

""He won't read them?"" I cried, shocked.

""He won't read 'em,"" she repeated. ""He doesn't like the way it makes him feel.""

We talked for a little while longer, then Susie got up to go.

A half-hour later, the phone in the office rang. It was Susie, inviting me to dinner with her family. It was the act of a good Christian. I must have sounded lonely. ""I'm making fettuccine Alfredo,"" she said.

I told her, ""I love fettuccine Alfredo.""

One of the great cliches of liberal criticism of the Christian right is the idea that these people are wrongheaded because they profess to know the will of God. H.L. Mencken put that one best, and perhaps first: ""It is only the savage, whether of the African bush or the American gospel tent, who pretends to know the will and intent of God exactly and completely.""

These criticisms sound like they make sense. But I think they are a little off-base. The problem not only with fundamentalist Christians but with Republicans in general is not that they act on blind faith, without thinking. The problem is that they are incorrigible doubters with an insatiable appetite for Evidence. What they get off on is not Believing, but in having their beliefs tested. That's why their conversations and their media are so completely dominated by implacable bogeymen: marrying gays, liberals, the ACLU, Sean Penn, Europeans and so on. Their faith both in God and in their political convictions is too weak to survive without an unceasing string of real and imaginary confrontations with those people -- and for those confrontations, they are constantly assembling evidence and facts to make their case.

But here's the twist. They are not looking for facts with which to defeat opponents. They are looking for facts that ensure them an ever-expanding roster of opponents. They can be correct facts, incorrect facts, irrelevant facts, it doesn't matter. The point is not to win the argument, the point is to make sure the argument never stops. Permanent war isn't a policy imposed from above; it's an emotional imperative that rises from the bottom. In a way, it actually helps if the fact is dubious or untrue (like the Swift-boat business), because that guarantees an argument. You're arguing the particulars, where you're right, while they're arguing the underlying generalities, where they are.

Once you grasp this fact, you're a long way to understanding what the Hannitys and Limbaughs figured out long ago: These people will swallow anything you feed them, so long as it leaves them with a demon to wrestle with in their dreams.

Which brings me back to Left Behind. Who gets left behind? Nobody, that's who. How could they leave us behind? They couldn't live without us. Even their most intimate family meals would seem lonely if we were missing.

At first, the vacationing New York schoolteacher Tom Hamill didn't say much at the dinner table. Speak when spoken to, help serve the fettuccine, pass the white bread and margarine. Ask politely about her son's senior year at high school, her twelve-year-old daughter's home schooling, the job her husband lost two years ago -- or maybe it was five. Smile in placid agreement as Susie compares Massachusetts Democrats (like Tom's real-life mother) to Al Qaeda. A cozy family dinner in Anytown, U.S.A.

Dinner started at about seven. John Kerry was set to accept the nomination at the FleetCenter in a few hours. Dinner Table wondered if the terrorists would strike. ""No, no,"" Susie said. ""The criminals wouldn't attack their own kind.""

""Hear, hear,"" I said.

I concentrated on my food. Grace was easy: Just hang your head. But once they moved into politics and religion, I began to worry that my silence was becoming conspicuous. Susie was shooting me searching looks. I noticed her husband, the wiry gray-haired dad with the slow voice and the henpecked posture, was watching me whenever I chewed. Like he was checking to see if I would swallow. Finally the discussion switched to the high school one of her sons attended; he had a couple of crazy teachers there, a mean lady and a guy with man-boobs....

""We have a transvestite at our school,"" I whispered, suddenly inspired.

Susie's husband and older son were still talking about the man-boobs teacher. ""Whaddya mean, which one?"" the younger said to his dad.

""We have a transvestite at our school,"" I repeated.

Only Susie heard me. ""No!"" she screamed. ""Did you hear what he said? A transvestite works at his school!"" She turned to me in horror. ""Is he allowed to dress like a woman?""

Now I had everyone's attention.

""Oh, yeah,"" I said. ""Totally normal guy, except that at some point, he started reading all kinds of . . . ""

""Books!"" Susie guessed.

""It's called possession,"" her husband said.

""Yeah, books,"" I said. ""It started . . . he was reading Agatha Christie books at first, then he got really into detectives. Next thing you know, he's reading Nietzsche. You know, the German philosopher.""

""The weirdo German!"" Susie exclaimed.

Everyone was staring at me in shock.

""And he comes up to me one day and says, you know, 'Well, since there's no God, I might as well be gay!' ""

""Oh, my God,"" her husband whispered.

""And he starts talking like this, and his appearance got more and more strange. . . . He started coming into work in drag. . . . ""

""Oh, my God,"" the husband repeated.

""And his boyfriend would come and pick him up at school. . . ."" I went on.

""Oh!"" Susie shrieked, scrunching her nose, as though smelling rotting cheese.

""The thing is, I'm the one who gets in trouble,"" I said. ""Like, there was this one little girl. I caught her listening to 50 Cent -- you know, the rapper -- and I started telling her about the torments of hell, and how she'd pay in eternity and all of that. And the principal comes up to me, and he's like, 'Stop, you're scaring the children!' ""

""Oh, yeah,"" Susie snorted.

""And I'm like, 'I'm scaring her? Are you crazy? This girl is seven years old. She needs to know about these things!'

""We have kids now, because they know you're a Christian, they go out of their way to make your life miserable,"" I said. ""I know this one guy. They'll take his Bible from his classroom and snort cocaine off it, right in front of him!""

Susie put her hands over her heart.

""They'll get suspended for a week,"" I said. ""But then they're right back in there.""

The table fell silent. The kids slowly started to slip away. Soon the only ones left were me, Mom and Dad, and a nearly empty bowl of fettuccine. Forty minutes in, my fork was still scraping the plate.

""Now this is good fettuccine,"" I said."

"event","Soooooo. What's new with you? Yeah? That's nice. Now let's get back to me. More me - less you.

Don't you think it's hard to be perfect? I do. I think it's VERY hard. I'm not even close to it and I think it's hard. You know one thing to do that seems to help; Trying EXTRA hard to not be a hypocrite. It can get you really far. Like for example; If you talk to someone a certain way, using a particular tone or vocabulary - don't cry foul when someone gets your attention by using that same vernacular. It's effective and worthy of attention when they do. It's complete bullshit when it is unwarranted - but if you can really see someone trying hard to get through to you ( and, come on, you know you can sense it just a little bit when that is happening ) and they seemingly, suddenly change their whole style and on the surface it seems combative and aggressive, they are probably doing that to get through to you. I actually LIKE that when someone does that. Not because I have low self-esteem or like to have my balls in a vice, but I like it because I think it shows that the other person is working hard to get through to you. And that means that they love you. Maybe they want to kiss you. I don't know. But it's neat when someone says something to you in a way that makes you go "" Hey. I recognize that tone! Those pop culture references sound just like ME! I like this guy! "" But then you get distracted by some kind of salty snack and you move on to blissful ignorance. 

That's so great.

THEY infuriate me. Yeah. Midgets and Pomeranians - oh boy - piss me of some MORE whydontcha? Oh they make me mad. OOHHHH my god I am getting so upset.

Small animals are kinda fun though. I hear that hedgehogs make good pets."

"event","I flipped off the TV last night. I mean I physically raised both arms, extended each hand and lowered all fingers and thumbs until only each hand's respective middle finger was left standing. And standing it was. Tall and proud. My brain, however, felt a little silly about having such an emotional reaction to something so silly. To say nothing of how ineffective it all was. But we do that all the time, eh? SLAM the phone down in disgust only to have the person who that was meant for, on the other side, hear a gentle "" click."" Or yelling full force at the car behind you for tailgating ( actually, thats a bad example because there are TONS of ways to get back at that person - I'll spill those secrets in future posts - oh oh, and remind me to tell you how to REALLY fuck with banks that are fucking YOU over somehow ). But last night I had SO fucking had it. I have been thinking about this topic and it's various subcategories for quite a while now and it's time for a revolution;

Now you are going to have to understand a few things before the revolution starts;

I'm in Oregon. You people in San Diego will think I am nuts and won't get any of this. So to you folks in San Diego; Fuck off.

The rest of you; Pay attention. Things are about to change and I may go to prison before it's all said and done. But dammit, I am livid about all this.

I'll start with what I have noticed and think about local television news in general. It's perfect. It's the funniest show on television. All the caricatures and stereotypes are accurate. All of them. They are all pompous and egotistical and shallow. All of them. Not one exception. Every city has an anchor woman that you can just TELL is a fucking bitch. Here in Oregon it's Tracy Barry. I had a small run-in with her once and she was true to form. Bitchy. Dead inside. Plastic. Her expensive perfume couldn't mask it.

Then there is the studly anchorman ( unless they are aging - then you have to drool over the studly sports anchor - yes - they are lovers ).

Then there are the field reporters. These, in general, are the most human of the bunch. You may see one or two of them at a concert or even a bar. They seem like they are somewhat regular people.'

Special assignment reporters are retarded and usually have some sort of physical flaw. Something small perhaps. But just large enough to keep them off camera for any length of time.

There are derivatives and subsets of the previous categories of human/talent/mannequin - but there is one category we haven't talked about yet. These dolts are the most questionable in intelligence. They have the most poorly developed ability to assess a situation. They are all too comfortable being SO wrong yet feeling NO need to step up and be responsible for their misinformation. Yet I have a feeling their hands are out, palm up, during every payday;

The Weather Department. Oh God how I loathe them. You cannot count on them to be right about anything...ever. They take up WAY too much time within the broadcast. All the fucking blue-screen graphics cannot fool us anymore. It is time to atone.

"" Dear local weather person. I have noticed that you are wrong a lot. I mean REALLY wrong. Not by just a few degrees here and there either. You don't seem very good at your job. I have noticed that you used to work for another affiliate here in town and now you work for this one. I'm not sure what to think about that? Did you get knocked down to the minor leagues to this station? Or was this a step up for you? Either way, I am on to you. 

I am on to the way that you predict sunny weather for NEXT weekend. But never think it's going to be sunny THIS coming weekend. It's always NEXT weekend. And then as we get closer to the earlier promised sunny weekend, you chip away at your forecast until you finally tell us to start shitting umbrellas. I don't know about you but I need more notice than that. Which is where you DON'T come in. You see, by going out on a limb and predicting what the 10-day trend is going to look like, you take a risk. You are a fool to do so. It's NEVER accurate and you know it. I noticed that your competition has chosen to go with a more safe 7-day forecast. And the OTHER one only does 5 days. Ya know what? You guys are ALL wrong. Always. Never right. And it drives me nuts that you spend 7 minutes to try and convince us that you have some tools at your disposal; Doppler 32 systems and satellites and sensors that take the blood pressure of doves in flight - shit - MILLIONS of dollars are spent on you and you still suck my motherfucking dick.

Oh oh - and nice try with the snow-job of putting up graphics that say ONE thing ( a few clouds with a picture of a mostly sunny sky and a temperature of 82 ), but you actually speak another ( "" The marine layer may not burn off and there may be some rain around the noon hour."") Just to cover your own ass. I know you cannot do anything about the weather. You cannot change it. I am not one of those people that blames you, half-kiddingly, when the weather is sour. But I do hold you responsible for telling me about it. What else CAN I hold you responsible for?

The fucking gimmicks you guys use are nauseating. "" Pete the weather pony says it's gonna be nice tomorrow! "" GREAT! He's a pony! He cannot be held responsible. Pass the buck off onto the quadruped. Nice. He can't work the radar system printer ( although you can't either ). The pony can't talk - therefore he cannot lie - therefore I can trust him more than I can you. And the pony works for a bag of carrots.

I think the local news should just skip you and your segment altogether. Put up a little graphic of what the next COUPLE days are looking like and move along. Skip the threat of GIANT BLUE ""L""s APPEARING IN THE SKY followed by a FLOCK OF IMMENSE YELLOW ARROWS and CLOUDS WITH ACTUAL MOUTHS TO BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN AND SHIVER YOUR TIMBERS by Thursday. You are a fucking cartoon. All of you are goofy looking. I cannot take you anymore. Please stop. You have done all you can within your world of technology and you have just made it all worse. Go outside and play some golf. You said it was going to be nice and sunny. But I think at about hole # 5 you will see a sudden storm move in and you may want to watch for lightning. You have angered God by making what he does trite and messy.

Enclosed is a bag of carrots. Please give them to Pete.

Also enclosed is a one-way ticket to San Diego. Please give that to Pete as well. He's earned it.

Finally, enclosed is a zip lock bag of my poop from last Sunday afternoon. I had planned to go camping because you told me it was going to be beautiful outside. Turns out that it rained and I caught the flu and had some pretty nasty diarrhea. 

Fuck off.

Sincerely."""

"event","I consider myself somewhat cultured and easy to be around in public situations. Shit, I am practically the life of the party. I do , however, have a few VERY specific instances that make me cringe. My oldest one took place in Junior High when I told Katie Hermann that "" I bet you have nice gentiles."" You read that right. I said Gentiles. As in "" non-jewish."" Which, to be fair to me, was probably accurate. I bet she DID have a nice collection of non-Jewish people in her life. I mean, who doesn't really? But she called my bullshit and corrected me and said "" it's pronounced GENITALS."" Later that year I would would ask her to the prom. She would decline. And I hung up the phone to wallow in my first experience of somewhat public humiliation.

That was my oldest - here is my most recent;

But first, more back-story. When Spiderman came out in theaters last summer or whenever it was, I had something happen that I was not used to. Something involuntary. When Kirsten Dunst was in that scene where her sweater was wet and you could see her boobies ( I'll never grow out of Junior High, I guess ) when the camera showed her clingy wet breasts about 25 feet in diameter each, I uttered, out loud "" Mmmmmmmmm."" I swear to God I didn't mean to. It just came out. Usually I can keep those thougts behind a well rehearsed poker face and noone is the wiser. I can even hide it so well that when I go to strip clubs ( which I find to be stupid unless they are playing good music ) that the dancers are always drawn to me. They must know I am having a good time and I'm playing it cool. "" Nice shoes "" I'll say. That's always an ice breaker.

Anyway, that Spiderman experience was the first time I had tipped my cards to what I was thinking. It scared the shit out of me. The 5 teenage girls in the row in front of me giggled when they heard me and they turned around to make a mental note of which perv to stay away from while exiting the theater. When they looked back at me, I looked back BEHIND me to scorn the guy behind me for drooling over the boobies. I was hoping to direct the teenage girls to him and then I was going to turn back around to join them in some mutual disgust. Unfortunately, what sat behind me was not a blamable sad-sack, but a couple half eaten boxes of popcorn from the previous showing and maybe some gum on the floor. There was certainly no actual carbon based life form for me to shirk my perverse, yet subtle, outburst. So I took my lumps and decided to make a joke out of it. "" Do you girls have a throat lozenge that I could borrow? My throat is sore."" I was just making it worse. I decided to shut up and let them enjoy the rest of the movie without any further commentary from me. Voluntary or otherwise.

So now you know that I have this very specific flaw. Here is how it manifested itself most recently;

I fucking hate musical theater. It's just too gay. I said it. There. If you knew me, you'd know just how small of a problem I have with gay people. I have been accused of being gay - but I just could never spend THAT much time in the gym. Anyway - musicals. VERY gay. TOO gay. All that fucking singing and communicating within a song. It just seems so much easier to speak to someone that have a tune written to convey how you are planning to "" travel across the world "" or "" going to look for my father "" or "" I think I'll have the chicken for dinner."" It's absurd. It bothers me. It actually angers me. Which, I know, is the opposite intended effect. 

About two weeks ago I went to a local production of "" Rough Crossing."" Magnificent, well lit, grand shows that have great orchestral sections and superb production value are one thing. You can hide within the couple thousand patrons and nobody even knows you are there. Including the cast. Local theater, however, is much different;

First of all it's you, the cast and about 200 seats. Only about 30 of which are filled. Right away, before the show even starts, you can sense that something is wrong. "" Was the Terror Level raised by the Department of Homeland Security? "" If it was, I can assure you that the color that would be appropriate a subtle hue of fuschia. I would love to be the Czar that was able to collect data, analyze it, and send out a warning to all men that "" Fuchsia Level means that, while you may not be homophobic, you will, by the end of this experience, understand why some people are. Here are your ear plugs."" The place was dead. And it was the hottest day of the year. 

Secondly; You never really know what kind of production the play is going to be as the directors in question take GREAT liberty and make some changes. I personally had never considered putting Schindler's List to song, but that's just me.

Thirdly; You can't trust anyone. Really. I know that statement may seem out of place. But it's not. You can't trust anyone to give you right information about the play. You can't trust anyone who works at the theater to turn on the fucking air conditioning. You cannot trust anyone selling me 2.50 bottles of lukewarm water to be accurate about when the intermission is and how long the play lasts ( Turns out there IS no intermission and it lasts a lifetime of death. Somehow. )

So I go into the seating area with guns a blazing behind my poker faced eyes. I was going to fucking hate this. I knew I would. I may as well make a game out of it and count things or something. This theater had 72 light fixtures, 12 cast members, one stage and  zero working air conditioning vents.

Lights go down. Music starts. I'm quickly in Hell.

5 minutes go by - ANOTHER SONG! ALREADY!?!?

10 more minutes. Another song. Is this a fucking Opera? I HATE this.

And when I start to sense the next song coming, which is invariably foreshadowed by one member of the cast gazing to the 11th row to "" search for his whatthefuckever he lost his heart to,"" that involuntary thing happens again. But this time, in my particularly angered state, I don't just go "" Mmmmmmmm. "" I say, out loud, "" God. Please don't sing.""

I was mortified. I couldn't believe that I just said that. Neither could the cast member who was a bit thrown off by my comment and got a little behind of the prerecorded music to which he was to sing. Nobody around me giggled. I looked behind me to scorn the Philistine who would dare make such a mockery of this obviously hard working crew and cast.

Nobody. Nobody was there to soak up any of my excess shame. What I would have given for an absorbent bucket of popcorn. Or 5 teenage girls who could easily have been the culprits. Assuming that one of the girls had a deep voice and was sitting my my seat. Ahem. Nothing though. Not gonna happen.

In my head, I was quickly returned to the 8th grade where I was just going to have to make do by playing with my gentiles. We hang out a lot more than I had planned at this stage on my life. 

I miss Katie."

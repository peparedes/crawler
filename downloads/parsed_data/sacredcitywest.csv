<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~jiggasexyou"">jiggasexyou</a> is the name.

gabe roberts gave me that nickname in tenth grade during baseball practice.  it's a play on my last name.  ciukurescu = jiggasexyou.  it didn't really stick but i still think it's damn cool.

it's friends only, i added everyone already, add me back.

"event","why is that even though it seems like things are going perfect, my self-conciousness and lack of self-esteem always kick in and ruin things for me?  certain people i don't know how to talk to, and i don't understand why, because i never have trouble making conversation with anyone... unless of course, i am woken up really early after only getting three hours of sleep.

but, let's look at this situation here:
i met this girl, i have no problem ever having a conversation with her, we talk on the phone, hang out, it's great.  i have no problem doing it, because then, i didn't feel the need to make a good impression, because i felt like in the long run, i wouldn't ever develop any real emotional feelings with her.  but now, after a couple of weeks, i realize that i've kind of gotten to have a little bit of a crush on this girl, and everything about her kind of fascinates me, and it seems like she's completely shoved my hang ups right out of my head.  as soon as i start to realize that, though, i have trouble conversing, because i'm too afraid of what she'll think if i say something stupid, or what.  and then it seems to have gone downhill from there.  my phone calls aren't answered, we can barely talk online, and so on.  we do talk when i actually see her, and occasionally we hold good conversation, but i still feel nervous about it.  comfort is only there when i see her and she's affectionate, but the only time that happens is when she calls me at 12:30 or 1 to see what i'm doing, and of course i'll go and see her, even if it's looming in the back of my head that maybe the only reason she's calling me is because she knows i'll be there in no time, ready to drive her home when she wants to leave.  because i'm a bitch.  but i really like seeing her and being around her.  i don't know, maybe her phone really is broken, but i doubt it, because she does answer when i call her asking for directions after she already asks me to come out.  i just want to actually talk to her, too, because when a day goes by and i don't hear her voice, i get a little sad.

it's actually only girls i feel like i want to get involved with that i get like this, where i am afraid to talk.  maybe the internet, and cell phones, should never have been invented simply for my sake, so lack of communication would be inevitable, instead of potential.  i get nervous every night, waiting for a call that will probably come, but for some reason i feel like it won't.

well, at least this time it's about a different one, right?

i just wish i wouldn't shut down, because i don't want her to think that i'm not an interesting person."

"event","you know, i thought it would be necessary to not write in here anymore, because i was embarassed of what someone was seeing me put down.  and rightfully so, i won't lie.  BUT... i've finally come to the realization that that portion of my life is completely closed, i no longer need any closure, i no longer feel the need to create fantasies and illusions in my head that it was still there, because right now, at this exact moment, i am content with what i have right now.  i'm sorry it took me so long to realize that everything's fine, and i'm sorry that i have the tendency to dwell on something so unnecessary.  

i really wish i had used this in a more effective manner, but i didn't, and that's too bad.  i was immature and i felt like anything (the one thing, give or take a few entries... believe me, when i tried to delete everything, i checked every entry to see what i put in) i wrote about in here over the past year or so was completely ridiculous.

i know how many times i've said in the past that i've had similar realizations, and how many times i've told everyone ""this is me growing up,"" yet i've felt just a few days later the same i had before i claimed these things, but this time i feel... no, i know that this is it.  i do things i've never allowed myself to do before, i think things through, i analyze situations and occurances until i feel like i've broken the whole thing down, i care about what's going on in our country and the world, and my musical taste has continued to grow and expand, to the point where i'm open to not just about anything, but everything.  i also know now that i am capable of making decisions, important ones for myself and others, without being unsure of myself and worried what the consequences could entail, just because i am now certain that i can make decent choices

most importantly though, i've realized that i CAN in fact live without that girl that i felt for so long would be impossible to live without.  and that's made me feel stronger in the past two weeks than i have in a long, long time.  

i even met a new girl and i have a wonderful time with her every time i see her, minus the first time we hung out because i thought she was a little weird, but that was because i was just getting to know her.  now, i really like spending time with her, and i enjoy talking to her.

i ripped my favorite shirt, though."

"event","Holy crap! I was just browsing Pollstar and I almost had an orgasm. The Smashing Pumpkins are doing a nine day stint at the Orange Peel in Asheville in July. Kind of like a reunion/reintroduction/transitional thing I guess. I don't know. Anyways they are one of my favorite bands ever and I will take a half assed comeback as opposed to nothing anyday! Woo. I must attend! 

I'm also kind of torn on going to the Idols tour. I really really really wanna see Blake and the show was fun last year when I went to see Taylor. Taylor got a lot of stage time because he won so I think I'll wait and see who wins. I don't wanna go and have to sit through 2 hours of Melinda freaking Doolittle,you know? Haha. Speaking of which,I'm gonna cry if Blake gets voted off tomorrow night. Nooooooooooo.

I'm so excited for the Bright Eyes show this weekend. By the time I got around to ordering my tickets,it sold out. So I got a pair on Ebay. Sixth row. I'm always nervous about ordering stuff on Ebay so I'm gonna freak out until the tickets get here. I paid for Fed-Ex so they should get here Friday or Saturday. Very last minute. Aghhhhh!

MCR are coming back this way in August. But they're co-headlining with Linkin Park. Ewwww.  

I went to Target tonight and spent too much money. I got a pair of bermuda shorts, a plain black skirt with big pockets on the front, a brown polo shirt with an owl on it and a bathing suit top. I bought the top because it was on sale for $5 but it looks awful on me. It's so hard to find a bathing suit with any support for my huge boobs. Haha. Most importantly I got the new Wilco CD. It's not getting good reviews but I love it. It's so pretty and mellow. Definately reccommend it."

I have a drawer and a plastic bag of mail I need to reply to. Mostly swaps and letters. If I owe you something,I apologize for being annoying and slow. I still love you though,don't worry. :D I went by the PO tonight to get a book of stamps but the APC machine was down. Grrrr. 

American Idol was so good tonight! Even the people I don't like gave good performances I have to admit. I voted for Blake 50 times and I voted for Jordin 100 times. (Ehh,obsessive much? I find voting addicting! Haha.) I'm not a HUGE Jordin fan but if I had to pick a second favorite,it would be her. Plus I would much rather see her in the top 2 rather than LeKeisha or Melinda. I'd LOVE to see Blake and Jordin in the final 2. 

I am downloading the new White Stripes single right now. I can't wait to hear it. I really want to see them live this summer. They're playing in Atlanta in July...I think I might try to go to that. Of course they are playing Bonnaroo here next month. I really want to try the festival thing...I've never been to a big festival...like Bonnaroo lasts 3 days I think and that scares me! I don't think I could survive outside for 3 days. Haha. I'm gonna go to it one year though. The lineup isn't impressive at all this year in my opinion. THREE WEEKS UNTIL BRIGHT EYES!!!"

"event","Oh,wow. I definately need to update more. It's been so mnay days now that I can't properly fill you in. Except on the big stuff since my memory is clouded and I'm way sleepy. 

I was off today and got to sleep in for the first day in WEEKS. I continued to lounge about the house all day because no one would take me anywhere. Hah. I watched tons of old school Degrassi episodes,cleaned my room,did 6 loads of laundry including all my bed stuff and rugs. Read a few magazines. Played PacMan a million times. Wow,I have been such a lazy cow today. You now what? Used to I loved to stay at home and wouldn't mind being stuck in for days but now I hate being home. I can't stand to be home for long periods. Even an entire afterrnoon. I get all nervous and anxious. I'd rather be away from home and away from those demons (haha)...I don't know. I'm just much more relaxed away from home.

Work? Ummmm...it's work. I am currently still tolerating my job. I hate it but I have convinced myself that I'm leaving any day now so I can tolerate it easier. Like I don't get ""involved"",you know what I mean? I just show up and do my job and leave. I don't get involved in any of the personal dramas or lives or details of anyone else. I still take my breaks in the break rooms and I try to participate in conversations and stuff but it's so boring. At least they have 2 girls now working that are close to my age. One of the girls was awesome until they hired the other one and now they are like best friends and it's really annoying. Friday Michelle and I worked in the laundry together all day. The boss put us together and it made me so nervous. She's okay I guess. Way annoying though. Michelle is eighteen and she is living with a guy who is 29 and MARRIED to someone else and has 2 kids with her and guess what? Michelle is pregnant with his kid. And from what she says it sounds like the guy is kind of still seeing his wife too. What an idiot. She was on her cell phone like 99% of the time and I did most of the work but that was okay with me because at least I didn't have to make small talk. Anyways I used to be good friends with the guy's sister a few years ago and I know for a fact that he had 3 different girls pregnant at the same time...I told her but I don't think she believed me. Michelle is so stupid to put up with him...she doesn't see anything wrong with the situation either! ::shakes head::

Last week was the My Chemical Romance show. Oh my God-they are the best live band I have ever seen. They put on one hell of a show. I am still obsessing over it. Not to sound like a teenybopper,but Gerard Way is the sexiest thing alive. I seriously considered finding a way to Charlotte to see them the next night. We left on Wednesday morning and got there in the afternoon and checked into a hotel. We planned to walk around downtown and snoop in some of the shops and stuff but when we passed by the Auditorium people were already lined up. So we got a snack at some deli and then we got in line. About three hours later we got in. Muse opened for them. They were really good! I think they are one of those bands that are really good at what they do but,unfortunately,they are doing what everyone else is doing. I could name 10 bands in 5 seconds that sound just like them. I think I already have one of their CDs. Anyways they played through the entire Black Parade record as The Black Parade (band) and then they left the stage and played ""Blood"" in the background and then they came out and did a set as MCR. They ad fireworks and confetti and I've never seen a show like that.  I never rocked out so hard in my life. As you know,I freak out in crowds but it wasn't so bad. We got behind a bunch of preppy ""hipsters"" and they were really annoying but the couple behind us were awesome. I met a lot of nice people believe it or not. As for merch,I got 2 shirts,2 stickers,3 pins and a poster and a cute souvenier bag. After the show we waited around for hours in the pouring rain to try to meet the band. The security people were major assholes and kept running us off (It was us,some girl and her mom and 2 other girls) and threatening to call the police and stuff. Anyways we finally gave up and left,figuring we had probably missed them. I gave the one girl my email and LJ and told her to let me know if they ever came out because she was dying to meet Gerard. She never got back to me...I had hoped she might anyways. I could use another cool friend,haha! I couldn't sleep at all that night. :D It was such a dream to finally see MCR live and I don't think I have ever mentioned it in here but The Black Parade is one of the best records ever and it has become one of my top 5 records of all time. 

The next day we did some shopping and touristy type things and came home Thursday night. You know what? People are much nicer down there or maybe I just fit in more because a lot of people talked to me! Like more total strangers struck up conversations with me (FOUR different people at the mall asked me about the MCR show) in that ONE day than has happened to me in the last TEN YEARS here. Seriously. I can't explain it. I just feel at home in that city. I'm going back in three weeks to see Bright Eyes. WOO! :D 

I've not been online much at all lately. I don't know why. Well,I've barely been home in a week because I stayed at my grandparents and they don't have internet. I'm off tomorrow too. I gotta get out of this hous. I need to go the bank and then I'm gonna go hang out at my sister's and see if she wants to go swimming or something."

"event","The Decemberists concert was so awesome last night! We got there about 10 after eight. We were late because I started my period on the way down there and had to stop at some nasty gas station. Ugh. Luckily I had some pads in my purse. Haha. And luckily I was wearing a loooong tunic top. But I was also wearing my most tight and uncomfortable jeans...ehhh. I went shopping yesterday and tried to find a cute top to wear since my Threadless order still didn't come. I guess it was because of my period that I couldn't decide on anything. I didn't feel like wasting $20 or so on a top I'd probably wear once...so instead I got this gorgeous pair of flats at Kohls. So anyways we had really great seats. The other shows I've went to at the Tennessee my seats had always been on the floor. I got front row balcony seats this time and I actually think I prefer sitting up there because you've got an unobstructed view and you don't have to worry about some seven foot asshole standing up in front of you the whole time. Which is usually what happens,right? Hehe. The opening band was My Brightest Diamond. Ehhh,I didn't like them at all. They reminded me a lot of Evanescence. The girl had an opera-ish voice and she was one of those annoying singers who is like constantly whispering or screaming...you know what I mean? The guitarist was pretty great though. The Decemberists came on and played this wierd chanting intro for what seemed like an hour and then the band came out. Colin Meloy is actually way more good looking in person. Hee. :D  The highlights were ""July! July!"" , ""O Valencia!"" , ""Sixteen Military Wives"" , and ""Yankee Bayonet (I will be home then)"". The girl from My Brightest Diamond sang the girl vocals on ""Yankee Bayonet"" and she started out all whispery and annoying but it was still pretty great. That's one of my favorite songs. :) It felt like their set flew by it actually lasted about ninety minutes. The best part though was the encore. ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" which I am pretty sure I hadn't heard before. The whole crowd was swaying and clapping and they had everyone scream like they were being eaten by a whale. They had someone come out in a joint whale costume and ""eat"" the band. They were falling around and playing dead and it was just so much fun. Everyone was way into it. If I find a setlist,I will post it. Oh yeah,did I mention I took Noah to this show? He loves the band...hehe. Seriously. :D I am so glad someone is inheriting my taste in music. And he had so much fun too. Am I the most awesome aunt ever or what? I'm so happy to be able to turn him onto good music and going to shows. I wish someone had done this for me when I was a kid! Well my sister took me to shows...but not until I was like fifteen and asked her to. Haha. No one else I know enjoys or even wants to go. Ugh. But Noah is awesome and I definately don't mind taking him. :) 

Yay! This is gonna be such a good month. Even if I only get to see the Decemberists and MCR. I'm not sure about Neko Case...if I can make it all,I am going to go. Damn being broke! Grrrrrr. And then I'm seeing Cake on the 27th. Maybe something else will come up too. :D

Mom dropped me off at Mamaw's on her way to work this morning and I hung out all day there. My sister offered to take me to try to get my liscence. But I haven't studied the book AT ALL so I figured it would have been a waste of time. I got home about seven and tried to sort through my mail drawer. I've got SOOOOO much mail to reply to. I have really let it pile up over the past month or so. I guess it is because money is so tight that I can't afford stamps and I've lost the motivation. I don't like to write letters and have to wait weeks or months to send them. Once I get a more steady income,I can get back in the swing of things. I've also lost interest in decos because my printer has no ink and I can't do labels or pictures to use in decos. Plus I've been so depressed and nervous. I don't know why exactly but ever since that one Saturday a few weeks ago when I made that long ass whiny post in here,something changed in me. I am sad and nervous and distracted and jittery and bored like all the time. I can't concentrate on anything. After that I took a bath and sat in front of the TV for three hours watching the comedy shows on NBC. Played with Pixie a bit and cleaned out the hamster cages too. Yuck. I didn't clean them out last week (and I NEVER skip a week...) so they were really stinky today."

It sucks because it's one of those shows that's not fun to watch by yourself. I love Blake. And my sister is into Dancing With the Stars and she's got me hooked on it too! And I don't even like it that much,but now I just HAVE to watch it. So I taped it too. I wonder who went tonight...!

My allergies have been way annoying this week. My nose isn't as stuffy as it was but now it's runny and I've got a nasty cough. I felt so bad Sunday and Monday. I need to get back on prescription allergy meds. 

I worked this weekend. I know,I know...I did go back even though I said I wouldn't. I hate it so much. I came home Saturday and cried. But I keep telling myself it's temporary. The thing is that we were still on layoff but when we came back,there were like 10 new people. Doesn't make any sense. And she scheduled me for 5 days this week...even though we had EIGHT roooms yesterday. Which does not require six housekeepers to be there! So nothing has really changed. It felt so wierd being back. It felt like nothing had changed there but everything had changed for me. I realized I did not miss it and I do not need it. And my boss was really nice too which didn't make any sense. Both days I was like on autopilot...I tried my best to ignore everyone.

Saturday was my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary so we had a big cookout for them at the park. It was fun I guess. I was in a bad mood and didn't feel good but I tried to enjoy myself. It was nice too see all my great aunts and uncles and distant cousins. We had a baseball game which is always fun. I hate sports but I try to be active and family games are always funny. Our team was horrible. We lost like 22 to 2. And Sunday I went fishing after work. Well I just went because I was bored. Haha. Monday I was supposed to work but I called in because I couldn't breathe and could barely talk. 

This morning I went to the bank and got lunch at Taco Bell. Tonight I worked for my uncle. I served at a Passover thing. $75 for five hours. Not bad. I wish I could do this full time! Heh. Dad let me drive all the way to Knoxville and back. Well when we got right in the city where the heavy traffic was we switched back. I am getting better at driving and it definately felt more comfortable tonight and I didn't almost kill us even once! Haha. Hopefully I will be ready to get my liscence soon. I wish I could get it before the 25th so that I could drive to Nashville.  

I got a betta fish today! I've been wanting one for a while. My nephew Noah bought it for me. Have I mentioned how awesome he is? He's eight and the sweetest kid ever. He's on spring break so he is staying with us most of the week. I am also dogsitting my sister's poodle until Thursday. He's so hyper! He's about six months old and he's into everything. He chews on everything and he pooped in the house once tonight. Her landlord is supposed to check  something out tomorrow and she didn't pay the pet fee so she's hiding him here. Pixie hates having another dog here. Like she ALWAYS sleeps in my bed but Harley was in here so she's sleeping in her doghouse in the living room. I'll try and get some pictures of them. Oh yeah,they told me he sleeps under the bed and apparently he really does. Is that strange? I thought it was! Haha."

"event","So my hair makeover did not turn out like I had planned. I didn't have enough of the color stripper. Apparently I should have listened to my gut and bought two boxes instead of one. So anyways I used it last night. My hair turned this awful,awful kind of RED. Not like orangey red,but a dark red. I knew my hair still had too much darkness/black left in it but it was too horrid looking for me to go out in....and I knew no one would run to the store for me...so I went ahead and used the bleach. The result? I am now a redhead! Haha. Coincidentally my camera batteries are dead so I can't post a picture. Terri describes it as a strawberry blonde. My roots are the most blonde (since it's my natural color anyways) and the tips about 3 inches up are a darker red/brownish color but overall it's an orangey color! It's kind of funny because I always wondered what I'd look like as a redhead. I actually really like it! I am thinking about keeping this color for a while. Anyways,I am definately keeping this color over the weekend since I have to work and there's a big family party thing on Saturday and it will freak everybody out. :)"

I was completely sure that my time there was over. I had no intentions of going back. But now I am definately considering it. I mean,I haven't had any luck finding another job yet and very few places around here are even hiring right now. For right now it would only be 2-4 days a week. Weekends of course. :( And I NEED a job! I could definately use the income. ANY job is better than none,right? And,depending on how many hours I work,I could still get some unemployment money too. I don't know what to do. There's no way I can stand another season there. If I do go back,it will definately only be temporary. Just until I can find something else. I called about 2 hotel jobs in the newspaper today...one of them had been filled already and the other paid almost $2 less an hour than I make right now. SUCKS. I hate this job so much...well,mainly my co-workers. The job itself isn't so bad. Mainly I keep thinking that aside from my bills,I need money for concerts! I STILL haven't ordered the My Chemical Romance tickets. I really wanna see Neko Case in three weeks too. Morrissey (Oh my God,yes,Morrissey!!!) tickets go on sale Friday. Damn...I could order them then and get really good seats. 

Speaking of concerts,I found out too late that The Killers are playing in Nashville the night before the MCR show. It's already sold out. I could have gotten tickets to both and stayed in town for both days. Ack. Tickets on Ebay and craigslist are going for outrageous prices. So,unless,I come across a REALLY good deal,I won't be going to that. Bright Eyes are playing on the 19th. I won't be able to convince anyone to road trip me down there twice in a month so I'll probably have to miss that one. Oh well. We'll see. If at all possible,I'm going. Hehe. :) 

I ordered <a href=""http://www.threadless.com/product/763/The_Soldier_Returns"">this shirt</a> to wear to the Decemberists show. I ordered it 2 weeks ago and it still hasn't shipped. I hope I get it before next week. I thought it would be cool for the show because the design is based on The Crane Wife. :)I also got <a href=""http://www.threadless.com/product/445/Bunnies"">this one</a> and <a href=""http://www.threadless.com/product/148/I_Like_Trees_Too"">this one</a> and <a href=""http://www.threadless.com/product/682/The_Scr_Emo"">this one</a>. I'm going to try to find a cute (cheap!) skirt to wear with it-I guess I'll try Goodiwll or Ross. And I'm going to get a new pair of flats or wedges-I saw loads of cute ones at Ross and Payless. 

I plan to do my hair Thursday. Depending on how it goes,I may wait a few days between the stripping and bleaching. Ehhh. Just to be safe,I'm gonna buy an extra bottle of black dye. And I was browsing the website and I saw that they sell Manic Panic dye at Sallys. Awesome. That's the brand I wanted to get but I figured I'd have to go for some random brand. I'm gonna put in some pink streaks or have pink bangs-I'm not sure which yet. :)"

Guess what? I won 2 front row Nascar tickets to the race in Bristol this past weekend! Can you believe that? I never win anything and I finally win something big and it's something lame like that. Haha. So my cousin works at Food City (grocery store) and they have this thing every year called Food City Family Race Night and he always get a bunch of free tickets. It's pretty lame but they have free food and they give away all kinds of stuff,like every person leaves with bags of goodies! All the Nascar sponsors are there giving away free products. Brandy and I didn't really want to go but we didn't have anything better to do so we went. Anyways we signed up for this drawing and they called my sister's name on stage. She went up there and she won a $250 giftcard for Bass Pro Shops! And then in the second drawing,we weren't even listening. My nephew came running up to me and said that I had won something! So I went up to booth and they told me I won Bristol tickets. I was freaking out because even if I don't like racing these tickets were worth like $100 face value and they had been sold out foreverrrrrr. So then I didn't know what to do with the tickets. I checked on Ebay and craigslist and I could have probably sold them for like $500 but I didn't have a lot of time and besides,I am much too nice. I know that my Dad has always LOVED Nascar-he's always been a HUGE fan and he's never had the oppertunity to go to a race. Plus it was his birthday too. So I told him he could go. My eight year old nephew,Noah,loves racing too so I gave the tickets to them. 

So on Sunday we dropped them off at the races and the rest of us drove up to Virginia and went shopping. I had saved my unemployment check for the week so I'd have some money. I didn't buy a whole lot. I bought a few necklaces and bracelets and headbands and candles at the flea market. I also bought Pixie some homemade treats at a dog bakery. The lady there was so nice,I bought a jumbo sized bag of them. I also got a red tanktop and a bunch of postcards. 

When we went back to the pick them up we were in traffic for FOUR hours. Ouch. We didn't end up getting home until about eleven. Dad and Noah had a great time at the race. They bought me a tee shirt. Hehe. I wore it yesterday and like FOUR guys smiled at me. I'm not kidding. 

Yesterday I got my hair cut. I went to the place I usually do and they had all new people working there. The kady who cut my hair was such a bitch. I told her I wanted the same cut,just a few inches shorter. So she's cutting my hair and says it done and asks me if I like it. I look in the mirror and she's given me some kind of strange mullet. It's all short in the front and like four inches longer in the back. I am trying my best not to laugh and tell her I want it shorter in the back. After I got home I was looking at it and she didn't even put layers in the back. It was layered in the front and from my ears all the way around it was one legnth. What a waste of money! I'm never going there again. So I cut in some layers myself. Geez. I like it though. I guess. Wish it were shorter though.

I did my research and I am ready to go blonde again. Most people tell me  ""NO! Don't ever go from black to blonde at home! Go to a salon! You'll destroy your hair!"" ...and I don't get it. It's just hair. If it messes up really bad,I'll just go black again for a while. No big deal. I wanted to go get the ""supplies"" (stripper/bleach/etc) today but I don't think anyone is going to take me. Grrrrr."

"event","My list of complaints for this week? My lower back is killing me again. Well,I am exaggerating I suppose. It hurts but I can ignore it most of the time. It's more annoying than anything. My tooth is feeling better though. I only had to take one Advil yesterday and one today. Netflix is being annoying too. My movies seem to be coming on random days now. It's kind of annoying because I looked forward to watching movies all day yesterday and then I didn't get any. I was supposed to get 3 and one of them came today. 

Today my sister came over and we went to the park. I hate sports and I am definately not athletic but we all played baseball for about an hour. They said I was pretty good. Haha. That's another part of childhood I missed out on...I was never on any sports teams. Then I walked around the track six times. Which I think equals about a mile to a mile and a half. It felt good but my legs are cramping. 

I am so sick of my financial woes. I know I complain about this all the time but it's insane. I miss shopping all the time...I miss being able to go out and buy stuff all the time. I miss being able to buy a new outfit or a new cd the day it comes out or a dinner that isn't a burrito at Taco Bell. Seriously...I am a shopaholic at heart and it's killing me. Haha. I haven't even ordered the My Chemical Romance tickets yet! I am praying that it doesn't sell out before I get that much extra money. Not to mention the HUUUUGE stack of mail I've got here that I need to send out. If I owe you something,chances are it's right here in my desk. I just really want to go back to work. In the papers today I saw like 4 jobs I'd really like to apply for and I'd really like to but then I think logically...how would I get there everyday? It's so annoying to not be able to drive. Don't even get me started. I am sick to death of that situation too.

I think I am going to go for the med transcription course at a local community college. Summer classes start in June but I really wouldn't go to school all summer. Is that lame? I know it probably sounds like an excuse but I've thought about it a lot today and I wouldn't want something to take up my whole summer. If I start in the fall,I can be done by next summer and have a job by then. Registration for fall semester starts in June. I can definately have my liscence by August. I have looked around and there are loads of jobs in this area. I'm excited about it. It would be nice to have a hotel office job when I go back to school. Most of the office people at my old job were students because they were always studying when they weren't busy. So I basically just need to find something for the next couple of months."

Which totally makes me laugh because you KNOW I got 1004 positives for ripping people off. Imagine how much I spent on postage to get all those. Ouch. I wouldn't even want to know. Which reminds me of something that pisses me off! One of the mods on there (not gonna say who because I don't want to cause a riot and it's not even that big a deal!) does not seem to like me. I had a transaction with her once and I don't even remember what it was but I was a little late on sending out my part.

Which brings me back to what I said before...you know I got better feedback than 99% of the people on there for ripping people off! It's really rude and she has no business doing stuff like that. TWICE she got me kicked off a swap. The last time,it was a traveling bookbox,and the girl who was organizing it PMd me and said that someone had warned her that I would not send out on time and I would most likely stall the swap. I PMd her back and told her that I knew who it was (doesn't help in my favor that she's a mod and popular on there!)and she always does this,ignore her, check my feedback and blah blah blah. The entire purpose of feedback is to build a reputation (since this is primarily a buying/selling/trading community) and it just blows my mind when people ignore it.

I came home and cried and was freaking out all night...my mind was racing and I couldn't concentrate on anything,and my stomach hurt and I just felt this enormous weight on myself. I barely slept the night before and then I couldn't go to sleep last night. I feel like my life is passing me by and I'm wasting it and everyone else is out living and I am sitting here in my room...alone and bored. Yesterday I spent most of the day with my sister and we had SOOOOOOO much fun and I came home at about six. And I didn't want to come home and I had to. And I knew I probably wouldn't see her again until next weekend. Lately I've only been hanging out with them on the weekends and then I got to thinking about how I probably wouldn't see them for a while and it really got to me for some reason. I know it sounds wierd but my sister is the closest thing I have to a best friend and my nephews are like friends too and I love being with them so much. I love hanging out with all of them. I'd love to move in with them. I wish I could. I miss her all the time. I am just so fucking lonely. And my parents house is so fucking lonely. And it's like today and yesterday I have this voice screaming in my head ""You are alone! You are always going to be alone!"" and suddenly the thought of being alone for the next 10 20 30 50 80 years closed in on me. What if I can't handle it? It's like everyone is I am never going to connect with anyone. I do really connect with my sister but she is much too busy with her own life for me and it's understandable. It's like everyone else is moving along and I am just stuck here in the same place. Anyways so today I went shopping with my parents- flea market,Kohls,Target and then we ate at a Chinese restaurant. I tried to enjoy myself but the negative thoughts kept flooding my mind. I got 2 pairs of shorts at Kohls and a pair of sunglasses,a headband and a Hello Kitty tote at Target. I didn't find anything at the flea market. So then we went to my grandparents' house. We usually have a Sunday dinner and everyone comes over for the afternoon. It's like an unofficial tradition. For no apparent reason,we were the only ones there tonight. So we ate and then my grandma wanted to go to Wal-Mart so we did and then we went by my sister's house. We only stayed for a bit and it cheered me up for a while. Then we went to McDonald's and I ate even though I wasn't hungry. We didn't get home until midnight and I played with Pixie for a bit and got online. 
For no apparent reason and completely unprompted,I have burst into tears THREE times today. I am not a crier,I rarely cry. 

I think this unemployment thing is starting to lose its amusement. I used to enjoy every day and now more than anything,I am just waiting for the day to be over. I really need to get out of the house more. It's not like I'm here ALL the time,you know what I mean? But I probably spend more time here than I should. I need to get a life. I need to stop thinking so fucking much. I need friends. I am so over ""friends"" that I never see and barely talk to. I just have this need to lose myself for a while,do you know what I mean? I need a vacation. I need a REASON. I need someone to love me and want to be my friend. God,I don't know what has come over me today. I want this feeling to PASS. Get the fuck out of my system. Because I know my life is not as bad as I am convincing myself. I am telling myself it will all be better tomorrow. I don't think this is PMS because I only quit my period less than two weeks ago. I definately considered that excuse. I am very aware that I am a loser and why can't I just embrace it? I wish I weren't so different. I am kind of scaring myself today. I spent a couple hours last night browsing through college websites and I need to get my ass back in school so I can be prepared for stuff...like a REAL job/career. I really,really wanted to do the whole pet groomer/pet shop thing and that excited me way more than any other job/profession did but it didn't work out. Maybe it will someday but I need to move on to something else. One thing that sounded a little like something I could do was medical transcription. Two local schools offer a one year program. I am going to look into this a bit more and who knows? It may work out. I looked in the newspaper today and there's like at least 10 ads hiring for it and the pay looks pretty great. I've always thought it would be cool to work in a hospital/etc but I couldn't stand dealing with people and touching them and talking and poking and probing them.

Another thing that might possibly be getting me down is I think my old job dumped me. You see,as yuo may know,I got laid off in December for the winter (I work at a hotel and business is waaaaay down in the winter and they lay off the whole staff because it only takes like 2 people to run the whole thing...) Anyways,I intended not to go back in the spring,but I didn't officially QUIT because then I wouldn't be able to claim unemployment...I intended on officially quitting when she called us back to work in March. Well,it's now mid-March and she hasn't called. In the newspaper yesterday they had an ad hiring ALL positions. Obviously ALL positions would mean mine too,right?That's what I am wondering. I don't know what to do. What if my unemployment claim isn't accepted this week? And,more importantly,why wouldn't they want me back??? I guess I wasn't a model employee but fuck I worked there for 18 months. Doesn't that mean ANYTHING??? I worked there for 18 months and I hated every fucking minute of it and I so longed to look that bitch right in the face and say ""I QUIT!""...how dare they revoke me of this right! And for no apparent reason. Now I am racking my brain wondering what I could have done to make them want to get rid of me. I can think of too many reasons. It makes me sad that people can be so cold. I'm confused and now I know my little vacation is going to be over any day now. Another winter gone. 

On a positive note,I told my mom and my grandma about the medical transcription thing and they were very supportive. They said they knew I was smart and was going to make something of my life. I'm so glad that they know that I don't want to be a fucking cleaning lady forever and my grandma sad that she always regretted dropping out of school and she wished someone had been there to support her and believe in her and that made me cry a little and it made me think that things might be okay afterall. I am not 100% sure this is something I am going to get into but it's a possibility. I'm definately going to do some looking into it. One of my biggest academic fears is going to school for years for something that isn't going to be useful or earn me a decent living and get me a good job. That's part of what has held me back. I just really can't wait to go back to school...I just need to find a reason!!! 

Changing the subject,the Taylor Hicks show was awesome last week. I took over 40 pictures and about 3 of them turned out okay. I really need a better camera for concerts. Ugh. That's going to be something I'm getting ASAP when I can afford it. I've only had mine for a little over a year and it's 3.2 MPs but it seems ancient. As does my 2005 era Ipod. Don't you wish technology would slow down a little??? Ack.

I got a $20 gift certificate for Amazon for doing some random survey thing a while a back and I ordered the new Fall Out Boy which I cannot believe has been out for over a month already without me hearing it. I also got the Silversun Pickups. I've got one song of theirs that I like and I've heard nothing but good things about the cd,so I got it. I also got around to ordering the new Bright Eyes ep. Threadless is having sale and I plan on splurging on 3 or so shirts after I go to the bank tomorrow. 

I've had a toothache off and on since Tuesday. I'm taking so many Tylenols and Advils this week that I am surprised my liver hasn't burst into flames or something. There's a free clinic here for people with no insurance and I considered making an appointment. I'm way scared of dentists though. So I am going to avoid it for as long as I can. Ditto with the depression thing. I am positive that I have some type of depression/anxiety/mental thing. I've never been treated for it-I'm just good at hiding things. 

Writing about this has cheered me up a little bit. Well,I'm not crying anymore. And I'm getting sleepy. I'll be okay."

"event","I went shopping today. It was fun. I got this way cute dress at Target. It's kind of hard to describe. It's gray and green and purple like assymetrical stripes and there's an overlap belt type waistline. It's called a knit wrap dress. I might post a picture later but I'm kinda lazy and busy. Haha. They had several awesome dresses there. I fell in love with this strappy bright green one and as soon as I get a job,I am going to buy it and look AWESOME in it all summer. Yay. And I bought a L...not an XL. Not an XXL. Do you know how great that made me feel??? I couldn't find a purse! Well I found a few but I wanted one with a long strap because I HATE having to like carry a purse around at a show...I want one that I can sling across me and forget about it. So I am opting for my trusty polka dot Old Navy messenger bag thingee. And then at Goodys I got a pair of navy blue flats. You know those Crocs water sandals that everyone and their mother was wearing last summer? I hated those,thought they were ugly but I tried them on for fun and they were SO comfortable and soft. Ahhhh. Well these flats are made of that same material but they're so cute. And I love flats.

So the high tomorrow is 54...which means it's gonna be like 30/40ish tomorrow night. Too cold for my dress. So I am going to wear my black leggings under it and my brown hooded cardigan. It looks pretty cool together...I can't help but feeling all dressed up when I wear a dress so this kind of dresses it down but it all matches. I can probably take off my sweater inside because it'll probably be warm. I washed my hair today so it shouldn't be all frizzy tomorrow. I'll probably just flip it out instead of straightening it because it's bouncy today. Hehe. 

My mom's going to the flea market again tomorrow and I can't decide whether or not to go. I want to but I don't want to wake up at 6 and be all grouchy and sleepy all day."

So last night I walked almost 2 miles. It felt good and I didn't even get tired until the last lap. It felt good! I don't think I'm gonna do my DVD because I did it plus walking yesterday. 

I got all my CC bills paid for February. It feels good! I can't wait to pay them all off. Haha. I love feeling accomplished! Even if it's something lame like this. 

Today it is all rainy and drab so I am going to watch some Gilmore Girls episodes and finish my book. I also got Stranger than Fiction from Netflix. I hope it's good. I always love Will Ferrell movies. I'm also going to try to catch up on letters. Yesterday I wrote 4-Kalyn,Lizzey,Sonja and Arica-and I made some mix CDs. Yay for getting things done."

"event","I am going to dye my hair blue black again. I love this color. So,anyways,I wanted to update but I really don't have anything to say so feel free to skip over this!

Saturday night I am seeing Taylor Hicks. Checked the forecast. Everyday it is supposed to be like 60+ degrees except Saturday the high is 44! I have no idea what I am going to wear because I'd already decided on this dress I saw at Target. Except now it's supposed to be all wintery...they are even saying snow flurries Saturday night. All the stores mostly have spring clothes now so I am going to have a hard time finding something. If we go anywhere tonight I am going to go to Goodys,maybe Old Navy as well. Oh yeah and I get this email newsletter from the Disc Exchange (a local indie record store chain) and they always mention shows this week and they totally bashed Taylor Hicks. It made me so mad. I totally considered not shopping there anymore. Assholes. A lot of people only bash him because he won American Idol and he's not all Justin/Britney/Kelly pop. I would still like him even if he had not been on American Idol-it's just that that show exposed me to him. I would love him even if he had never even made top 24 or anything. But now it's like supposed to be ""embarrassing"" or something to like him. People piss me off. His pre-Idol music is much better anyways. 

I've had a nasty cold all week. Although now I think it is leaning more towards allergies. Either way it's really annoying. 

Speaking of musical guilty pleasures...I got a burn of Paris Hilton's cd and it is SOOOOOO bad. I've been dying to hear it because I knew it was awful and I wanted to see HOW awful. Whoa. She has like no voice and the songs have the dumbest lyrics. However I think that if this cd was released like 6 years ago,it would have been a massive hit. The first single ""Stars are Blind"" is really catchy and cute though...I think I'm gonna put it on my Ipod and quickly get rid of the whole cd. Haha. I've also been listening to Fergie's cd and I really like it. It's definately not the kind of stuff I usually listen to but it's fun. 

I sent a check for my Goodys CC  bill about 2 weeks ago and they still haven't gotten it. It's due Friday and now I don't know what to do. If I go ahead and pay online the $40 online,then they cash the check too,I can't afford that! Oh yeah...the other day I checked my Gmail and there was an email from one of my CC companies and it said they had locked my account,to please call this number so I did and they wanted me to confirm the most recent charges. One of them was from the post office and the other 3 were from places I had never used! Napster,Paypal and some wierd website had tried to charge $66! I told the girl that I had never used Napster and never even heard of the one website and my Paypal is not linked to this card. So she closes that account and told me to shred my card and that I would get a new card in about a week and she gave me a new account number. That freaked me out. Someone else was using my CC numbers!!  All I can think of is when I first got that card,I used it for a lot of offers on Treasure Trooper and some of those sites were a little shady. Maybe they kept my numbers. It's scary though and I am definately going to keep close tabs on all my CCs and my debit card. My cousin went a few weeks ago and was denied a loan and they checked his credit report and someone had a $700 cable bill on his name. Some guy who lives in Chattanooga was/is using his name and social security number and everything. Now that's scary. 

I'm a little bored right now. I didn't have any plans for today but then my sister said she was coming over so now I am thinking she might want to go swimming or something so I'm gona wait till tonight to dye my hair. I'm gonna go work out now. :)"

"event","I had every intention of pretending to be spontaneous this week and chopping off all my hair again and bleaching it. But then I thought about it and I really,really despise going to salons even though I've got an awesome old lady named Celia who cuts my hair sometimes...like I hate having to make conversation and stuff. And silence is kind of awkward. So anyways I decided to wait till next month because next month is gonna be busy and I'll be going to Nashville and to a bunch of shows so I should just save my new look till then. I've had black hair since I was 16 and emo and various colors since last fall...for some reason,maybe it's all the nostalgia I've been feeling lately,I want to be blonde again. At least for a little while. 

I was looking at pictures the other night and in this one picture from a camping trip in 2002,my hair was blonde with like a reddish tint. It was such a great color but I can't remember coloring it that color...maybe it was wet or the sunlight or something? After I bleach it,maybe I'll try a strawberry blonde color. Haha,I apologize for all the boring hair talk!!! 

Anyways tomorrow the weather is supposed to be all pretty and 60ish so my mom is going to set up her booth at the flea market. I went through my closet and I've got a massive pile of clothes taking up half of my floor. I'm procrastinating on pricing them and packing them up to go. Some of them I'm going to put on Laundro though. I might go with her tomorrow. I don't know. It's kind of boring but it's fun too. I need to make some money. She'll take my stuff but I want to go so I make sure she doesn't GIVE it away. Lol. But I don't know. My stomach is hurting really bad tonight. I hope I'm not getting sick again. Plus I don't wanna wake up at six am. :)

I changed my layout again. It's the cutest one I found."

"event","I am rediscovering my love for Bright Eyes! Not that I ever quit loving them really but I did get distracted. Oh,and there's this Livejournal that is supposedly Conor's. I want to believe it is really his but I'm pretty sure it isn't because he lets anyone friend him. It seems a little too random and he's not got that many friends though...so maybe it is? Some girl in one of the communities emailed it to me and I guess it is kind of secret? I don't know. Anyways I am really looking forward to seeing them live sometime soon. Get your ass to TN already,Conor! Lol. I downloaded the new EP already and I'm gonna buy it as soon as I can. 

I was supposed to work a banquet tonight but they canceled it last minute. GRRR. And he told me the next time he'd definately need me is April 4 which is the night of the Decemberists so I won't be able to. Great. Oh well,hopefully I'll have another job by then! My mom or no one ever did take me to apply for that one job. Losers. Now the ad is gone anyways. There's a hotel in the paper though that is hiring for everything and it the closest one to here. I really want to get away from hotel work but whatever. I just want a job! I'd kind of take anything that presented itself right now,you know? I'm so tired of being broke all the time and watching every single penny I spend. I need some serious retail therapy. Like today the weather was all spring-ish and it made me want to go buy spring clothes! I bet Goodys has all kinds of cute stuff. I plan to dump out my closet tomorrow and go through all my clothes...I need to get rid of some so I can buy more! Ehhh,I'm so the fashion whore. Haha. 

Ooooh,I'm doing a box swap with someone! I've heard of them but I've never actually done one. The thing is you fill a flat rate Priority box with stuff your pal/swapper likes...like slams,decos,cds,etc. It sounds like so much fun! I can't wait to put it all together even though I might not be able to ship it for a few weeks since I've got 3 bills due in the next 2 weeks and a new outfit to buy and a show to attend. 

The OC series finale was on tonight! I cried. I totally did. I love that show so much and I've watched it since the very first episode and even though it sucked so much this season I never missed an episode. It was so sad how they fit like all these milestones (birth,pregnancies,weddings,moving,etc etc etc!) into one episode. I'm so happy Seth and Summer got married and everything. They are the cutest fictional couple ever. This show meant so much to me! I know it sounds dumb but whatever. For some reason I really want to watch all the DVDs now and cry and wallow in nostalgia. I've been all depressed now ever since. I am in such a fucking rut. I may not have realized it till now or I have and I have been ignoring it but right now I am overcome with the feeling of how my life is passing me right by and I'm just standing on the sidelines watching it and not really participating. Wasting it. I seriously have to do something. SOON."

"event","So in Sunday's paper,I saw a job ad I really wanted to apply for. It was for a veterinary/kennel assistant at an animal hospital. It's located in Newport right down the road from my sister's place and I took Pixie there once. It sounded like it would have been perfect for me! (weekends off!) So I told Mom I wanted to go up there on Monday. Yesterday I get up and Mom's still in her PJs. I remind her that I wanted to go about the job and she says okay and she's whining about how tired she is because she had to take the baby to the hospital the night before and didn't get home till 5 am. I told her that I didn't go to bed till then either because,duh,she made me go with them. (Her van tore up and she wouldn't drive my car unless I went to!) I tell her all she has to do is drive me and I don't need to go anywhere else so just go in your freaking pajamas for all I care. Anyways I keep waiting and we end up not going. I knew Dad wouldn't drive me back up there because he just came from there. Today Mom is taking Jason,Terri and the baby to Knoxville for a doctor's appointment and will be gone all day. She is always taking them everywhere they need to go and they have a freaking car! Grrr. She didn't have to leave here till noon though but she said she didn't have gas to drive me to Newport (which the job would only be about 25 minutes from here) even though I offered to pay. Hell,they've probably hired someone by now. I'm so sick of this fucking situation. How am I ever going to be able to GET another job if I can't even go APPLY for one???

So it looks like I'm stuck here all day again. I seriously need to clean up and do laundry. I didn't do my exercises yesterday but last night I went swimming at the community center for an hour and a half so that counts."

You should watch it. I've actually never seen the British version so I can't compare it to the US one but I can tell you that it is better than 99% of shows on US television in my opinion. :) I really need the Season 2 DVDs. Anyways,a little random and offtopic, but in real life he is kind of cute to be like 40. Hahaha-or maybe I just saw a really flattering picture? I don't know. Or maybe I have really wierd taste because when I said Sacha Baron Cohen was hot,no one agreed. Haha. Anyway,I've got a bunch of Jim and Jim/Pam icons but none of anybody else. Hmm,I should find some. 

Anyways,so I've been sick all week with a killer stomach flu. Everyone in my family has had it. My sister and my nephew even had to stay in the hospital for 2 days. I feel okay today. I still don't have an appetite which is fine by me! I am down to 160 now. I think I've lost 8 pounds in the two weeks that I've been exercising. However,I lost 4 of those this week. Okay I have never been one to weigh myself but last week I bought a scale to weigh my heavier packages on since my postal scale only goes to a pound...and now I've started weighing myself instead. :(

I'm kind of dissapointed with American Idol this year. Top 24 and I don't particularly like/love any of them. :(

Yesterday I finally saw Marie Antoinette. I really liked the movie. Kirsten Dunst was great in it-I just love her and she's always in good movies. As was Jason Schwartzman-I used to have the most massive crush on him back when he was in Rushmore and Phantom Planet. He's still adorable. :) And I love Sophia Coppola's other movies so I guess my opinion may have been a little biased. I love the fashion of that period. Running with Scissors was good too. I still nead to read the book too because it is supposedly way better. While I was sick,I mostly watched DVDs so it seems like I've seen 39990950 of them this week! 

I think I'm ready for another haircut. Mine is sort of a awkward legnth right now with the layers...it's so hard to straighten or flip or anything. I need to color it again too but I have NOOOOO idea whether to go black again or blonde again or what. Opinions??? I am seriously thinking of going blue/black again. 

Well I am trying to waste time. My mom's supposed to be picking me up so we can go out. I need to go to Wal-Mart,P0 and I am in desperate need of fast food. Hehe. And I've been ready for like an hour already. 

P.S. Nashville. My Chemical Romance. April. MEEEEEEEEEEE! :D"

"event","I'm really sad that The OC is ending. This has been one of my favorite shows for 4 years. I'm really going to miss it even though this season has been crap in my opinion. A lot of people seem to think this is the best season ever...but to me it just sort of feels like a different show compared to previous seasons. Now there are only 2 episodes left. I'm dying to find out how it all ends. I literally cannot wait. At least now I can watch Grey's Anatomy on Thursdays,assuming it keeps the same time spot next season. I missed a LOT of it this season so I'll have to get the DVDs as soon as they're released. 

Last night I watched the movie The Science of Sleep and I cannot tell you how awesome it is. It's definately one of my favorite movies now. I cannot express my love for Gael Garcal Bernal in words. I really want the soundtrack too. Do any of you have it by chance? And I was flipping through Blender and one of the singles to download this month is by Charlotte Gainsbourg,the girl in the movie. I didn't know she's a singer so I'm gonna try to find some of her songs. Seriously,I  can't believe this movie didn't get any Oscar nods or something (It hasn't,right?!) for effects or something. It was strange and beautiful. You should definately see it.

Oh and I downloaded some songs by Kate Nash and she is awesome too. I wish I wasn't stuck on dial-up and I would turn this into an MP3 blog. Hmmm,or is okay to post other's links that I used? I'm not sure. It probably is frowned upon I'm sure. Anyway I googled a picture of her and put in a Girls with Guitars deco and it turned out gorgeous. So gorgeous that I wish it was MY deco. I always seem to do my best work in other people's decos! Hah."

"event","God,I am so bored today! Okay,so last Friday my brother and sister in law and the baby came over and they wound up staying over because it was snowing. Saturday night we went to Newport and Mom's van broke down at Wal-Mart. We couldn't get home till about 3 am so they stayed over again. Sunday night they stayed and watched the Super Bowl and went home about 11. I didn't really mind them being here at first and I hung out with them and everything but then it got annoying because they won't leave. I'm sorry,I know it sounds mean but I can't help it. Tuesday night they came over and stayed over again because Mom had to take them to an appointment early in the morning. They stayed over again last night too. They're still here this evening. Terri is okay,like I can tolerate her better now. She's still way annoying though but now we're getting on better. And the baby is so cute and everything and I think my parents love having a baby around. Terri has mentioned moving back in here several times lately. This bothers me. Haha. It's really none of my business anyways I guess. But I have to hang out in the living room with them because when I come in my room,she follows me and is all nosy so I can't like get online or write letters or deco or anything. Grrrr. I like my privacy! Is that wierd? 

I just checked the Bijou calendar and The Hush Sound are playing there March 9th. I love them! I sort of like Straylight Run too...the other 2 bands I've never heard. I guess I might go to it. Copeland are coming too and I really like them but they're opening for Switchfoot and I hate them. Ehhh. I may go to Mute Math in May. If I can get someone to go with me,I'm gonna go see Animal Collective too. My Decemberists tickets came yesterday. I got front row...balcony. They only had crappy floor seats left so I just opted for balcony. Ehhh.

I am in love with a band called The Boy Least Likely To! Their music is so much fun. 

Last night we went swimming at the community center. I don't think I've ever been swimming in February. Haha. And you know what? Last fall I bought like 10 bathing suit bottoms on sale for $0.47 at Old Navy and I wore one of them last night and they're huuuuge on me. Like I had to keep holding it so it wouldn't fall off. That sucks! I don't mind my shrinking butt but I do mind that I can't fit all my new bikinis! Grrrrr. Speaking of which,today I was right in the middle of my exercise video and my mom came home with McDonald's. Yay,so all my efforts went to waste. However since I have been exercising some and sleeping at least 9 hours a night,I feel pretty great."

I don't want to do it but I can definately use the money. I'm a little nervous because I haven't done this in years but ehhh I'm gonna go get ready. $75 will cover the Decemberists and I'll even have a bit left. :) Then I can use my other check for bills."

"event","Jeff Tweedy show was awesooooooome last night. Such a treat. I was 8th row but had a perfect view. Loved it. Except I didn't realize my stupid fucking batteries in my camera were dead until I was already there. I coulda got some good pictures. You know what? At one point I had ALL of Wilco's CDs and now I only have their last one. I wonder what I did with them? I don't remember selling or trading them because I've never stopped liking them. Hmmm. I only had $20 on me so I bought the live dvd and a postcard set. They had cool merch-except they were out of tee shirts all night since it was like their last day of the tour. I just checked their website and they have baby clothes and even dog tees...isn't that awesome? Oh yeah,they had these gorgeous silk screen posters that said like Knoxville,TN Bijou Theatre and the date...I wanted one so bad but they were $25! On their website they have them for every other night so I know they'll add Knoxville...I might get one when I get my tax refund next week! Opening band was pretty good...Tin Cup Prophette was their name I think. 

Speaking of which,I am getting $250 back. Way less than I expected....that's like the same that I got last year and my income was almost double this time. WTF. My Treasure Trooper earnings for this month was $68. I was way lazy this month...I earned all of that except the $9 in referrals in one night. 

Anyways,Decemberists tickets go on sale this Friday. I'm only gonna have enough for 1 ticket but I really need to get 2 because I plan on bringing a guest. So....I might have to sacrifice a good seat and get my ticket next week...I should get my refund about midweek. Ahhh,I'm so fucking pysched to see the Decemberists!!! 

I finally got my Nintendo DS and I am in loooooove with this game Nintendogs. I've got a Yorkie named Xander and a Chihuahua named Ruby. It's so addicting. I guess I am easily amused because when I say ""Ruby,Sit!"" and she really does,I freak out. Haha. I've never been into video games much and now I carry my DS with me everywhere. Noah got Guitar Hero 2 this past weekend and oh my God,that's the coolest game ever. I suck at it but I'm learning! Haha."

"event","People are so strange. On Laundro there's a girl that said she wanted to buy the 2 NWT dog tees I had so I give her my paypal address and I tell her $11. She just PMd me back and was all ""OMG,I thought it was $10 shipped!!! No thanks.""  Okay...first off,lady,the post office does not allow me to ship things for free;therefore I do have to charge people. Shipping those items would cost me around $3. I was being nice and wanted to get rid of them so I was only going to charge you a $1. ONE DOLLAR. If you cannot afford one extra dollar,maybe you shouldn't even be spending the whole other $10?! Lol. I hate it when you're being nice to someone like that and they think it's not enough.

So yesterday I went to the doctor with my mom and we were up there for about 3 hours. I could not sit still because my back was hurting. So after we got out of there we went to Goodys and Wal-Mart and Burger King and the pain was getting worse. By the time we got home I couldn't stand to bend over or climb out of the car or anything. I took a few tylenols when I got home and that didn't help at all. It was kind of scary. My back hurts a lot but never that bad. So I barely got off the couch the rest of the night. I'm not sure what caused it...I figure it might be sitting so long at the computer or carrying around these boobs everyday...haha. But then I was reading up on it last night and it says I could have pulled a muscle or something but I can't remember lifting anything heavy in the past few days. It's definately not as bad today. Just certain ways I move or bend,it hurts. By the way,my mom got good news yesterday. They did 3 tests and couldn't find anything in her breast. Stupid doctors scaring her to death. 

I finally won a DS on Ebay yesterday and paid for it last night! I got an email this morning that said it was shipped and I tried to use the tracking numbers but it's not working yet. Hopefully I'll get it sometime this weekend. I can't wait. I'm really nervous buying it from Ebay and it sounds like a legit user. I bidded on like 50 of them and always lost (usually by like a $1!) so I was shocked last night when I got online and saw that I finally won. Now I can quit staring at this stack of games on my desk and actually play them. Woo. I also finally got the calendars I ordered. I had a $10 gift card for Barnes and Noble so I used it on their site. They had all their calendars on sale so using the giftcard I got 2 and only had to add $10.04 including shipping. I got a Dr Seuss one and it's definately not as cute as I had imagined. And I got a Simpsons page a day. 

I don't know what to do next. I think I might work on a few letters and packages and watch movies. By the way,this week I have recieved packages from <lj user=""decotangent"">, <lj user=""zvezda""> and a wonderful package from <lj user=""superkattis"">. I loved the mix cd! I've listened to it like 3 times. I especially like the Lilly Allen track. I downloaded a song of hers once and didn't like it so I wrote her off but now I think I'm gonna try to find her album. :)"

"event","I hate summer...why am I suddenly longing for it? Maybe it's because I am reading this book called Summer in the Land of Skin by Jody Gehrman. I picked it up a few months ago on the $1 rack at McKays and it's pretty good for chick lit. But the story is eerily similar to this story I wrote a few years ago...it's about a girl whose life is changed during one summer where she meets a new crowd,falls for a rock star,etc...it's kind of depressing. I thought mine was original and I'd never even heard of it or the author before,I just randomly bought it. Plus I wanna wear my flip flops and capris...summer fashion is so much more interesting than winter fashion in my opinion. Like I can't do cool layers because I'm always hot and then I have to take off everything when I get there...sweater,scarf,coat,whatever. Plus we have pretty mild winters lately and the weather is like a polar oppisite almost day to day. Haha...I have no idea what I'm going to wear to these upcoming shows!!! I'm gonna try to find a cheap top or 2 when I go shopping tomorrow. I also gotta get the new Shins cd and some hair dye. No idea what color I'm gonna get.

I got my Treasure Trooper check today! Woo. I am going first thing to deposit the $150 tomorrow because I have to pay for the DS I bought on Ebay. See-I had $150 saved for like a months and couldn't find one anywhere so I gave in and spent the money and promised myself I'd buy the DS when I got the check. I got the other $120 on a Visa gift card. I am going to use half of it to order some stamps on USPS.com. Their website is beyond slow on my comp so I spent like 2 hours putting together an order last night -5 books of cute stamps (since the local po never has any except the flags!),3 books of postcard stamps and various other stamp booklets in tiny amounts ($0.02,$0.10,etc), various free shipping supplies...go to place my order- what do you know,the store is closed,please try your order again tomorrow. So then I go to my cart so I can copy down what I want...my cart is now empty. NOOOOOOO! Haha. 

I'm so glad American Idol is back on! I can't explain my unhealthy obsession with this show. Haha. I loved that beardy guy!! (Haha,I didn't catch his name because I thought he was gonna be lame!) I hate beards but his voice was awesome and I bet if he makes it they will give him a shave and a haircut and he'll be hot. No one else has really struck it with me yet so far. 


Yesterday I watched Elizabethtown again. I love that movie so much. I know it was a total ripoff of Garden State but I kind of like Kirsten Dunst and her character way more than Natalie Portman. Claire and Drew had such a cool relationship...the ""map"" she gives him...Oh My God. I want to drive cross country someday. Even if I have to go alone. I kind of hate it when a movie gives you that ""restless"" feeling,you know what I mean? Like it's telling you should be doing else...this could be YOUR life! I barely slept at all last night."

"event","I hate being bored,don't you? Especially when you have no reason to be. There's a dozen things I should (er,need) to do but I can't shake the feeling and actually do anything. Instead I am sitting here,feeling compelled to write an entry even though I have nothing to say. I had plans to road trip to Nashville today but,as always,plans get botched. And I want to do decos but I can't because I have no tape. 

I really can't wait to do my taxes. Last night I did my brother's and they are getting back $1500. Holy cow,I would be happy to get even half that! LoL. But I have a pretty good idea of what I'll be getting since I got an ""unofficial"" W2 from my work last week and added it up in my head. I had planned to pay off one of my credit cards (the one I got just before Xmas) and cancel it. I read that that is bad for your credit but,come on,I know I have too many cards and therefore too many payments. But then there's also 3 shows I *definately* have to attend. Not to mention that my dad is planning a big family vacation for next month. It's not 100% official now but if we do go,I'm gonna need lots of spending money. My checkbook is so screwed up. I am never going to get it balanced. As of today,I have $49 more than I am supposed to...which I am not complaining because I'd rather have $49 extra than $49 missing. Haha. I do online banking but it still takes a couple days for stuff to be listed on there. So I did not deposit any of my check yesterday because I got to the bank too late for a same day deposit so I just cashed it so that I would have money for this weekend. Which is not turning out at all like I had planned. 

My anxiety has been getting the best of me this week. Aside from worrying about MONEY,work,school,Pixie,everything...my mom went to the doctor the other day and they found a lump in her breast. They explained to her how it could possibly be cancer. She has to go for tests on Wednesday. She's not taking it too well. I'm trying to remain optimistic and hope for the best though. My mom is sick a lot and she's got a lot of health problems but she doesn't take good care of herself. It's so annoying because we have to watch her like a hawk to make sure she takes her medicine and she smokes like a chimney.

I'm burning a tart called Butt Naked and it smells soooooo good. It smells kind of familiar but I can't place what it smells like. I bought them from a candle lady at the flea market in Virginia last week. Mmmmmm."

I was a dork and rang in the new year at home. Right here on the computer. Panic! at the Disco in the backgorund. I just didn't feel up to going out and nobody else wanted to anyways.

Guess what? Thus far I have made $271.52 on Treasure Trooper this month. With like $100 more pending. Hope some of that will approve before payout. Work sucks and for some reason I can't find any comfort in the fact that tomorrow will be my last day EVERRRRRRR at Capri. Wow.

"event","Okay,I just read this in a list thing of new music releases to look for in 2007:

Ryan Adams - The Complete Recordings (94 CD Set)

WHAT??? 94 CDs??? Holy hell. How can I possibly afford that and/or how would I ever download that much??? I wonder how true this is...

Let's see-I am looking forward to a lot of new releases...some of them won't be till far out in the year though.

The Shins - Wincing The Night Away (only a few weeks away! Yessss. Finally. And I can't wait to see them on SNL.)
Ted Leo - Living With The Living (I've downloaded a few tracks already and ::swoon::)
Scarlett Johansson - Scarlett Sings Tom Waits (When I first heard about this one,I thought it was the strangest rumor ever. Apparently it is really happening...?!)
Smashing Pumpkins (Apparently this one is happening as well...?!)
The Faint (Seems like aaaaaages since their last release!!!)
Rilo Kiley (Ahhhh...this one cannot come out soon enough! I'm biting my nails...)
Bright Eyes (EP very soon....full legnth in May! Woo.)

And of course there are loads more! 

Yesterday I spent like the entire day watching movies and playing around with decos. 'Borat' was really funny! I am typically not a fan of crude type humor but I really liked this movie! Some of it was lame but overall it was awesome. 'Happy Feet' was dumb...I usually like movies like this but this one was lame. 'Cars' was such a boy movie...didn't like it either. 'Little Miss Sunshine' was really good! I loooooved it. I really gotta buy this DVD. Today I got 'The Last Kiss' and I'm dying to watch it but I didn't have time. Probably won't tomorrow either. I have been in such a bad mood today...totally not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow."

"event","I am already experiencing the after Christmas blues. I know I am going to remember this as one of the best. I had so much fun. I usually get all depressed or upset with people but this year I was in a great mood the whole time. I didn't even let Terri get under my skin. Maybe this is because I have my ally back. It seems like I've been spending all my time with Brandy lately. We have so much fun together. This is just how it used to be. Saturday night we went to Dollywood again and it really assisted in getting us in the holiday cheer. We even got in trouble for flipping off the cameras when it takes your picture on one of the roller coasters. Good times. 

On Christmas Eve,as is our family tradition,we went to my grandparents' house in Gatlinburg around noon and ate lunch and opened presents. Instead of a traditional holiday meal,they always have burgers and fries. Yuck. So I loaded up on my grandma's coleslaw. Then we opened gifts and they gave us each $50 but it's neat because they give it in 10s and wrap them up in boxes. I wish I got to see them more. Then we go to my other grandparents' house (my mother's parents),eat dinner and exchange presents. From my aunt and uncle and cousins I got an Avon bath set. Smells yummy and they got me the same thing for the last 2 years...haha. From my grandparents I got an Alice in Wonderland purse,a travel bag thing with a Yorkie on it, a birthstone bracelet, Rainbow Brite pajamas,2 Nightmare Before Christmas tees and a super comfy pink blanket. 

On the way to my house we listened to ""Fairytale of New York"",the version by the band Stars,for an hour straight. We sang along and traded verses and came up with our own version of the it,entitled ""Fairytale of Sevier County"". We are such dorks. From Noah,I got a gorgeous Barbie Fairytopia doll (I got 3 dolls for Christmas...maybe I should start collecting them? I've always found dolls a bit disturbing but I love the fairy ones I got! And Sally from NMBC)and a glittery lava lamp. From Jacob I got Hello Kitty slippers and from Brandy and Jack and Steve,I got a neat set thing with shampoo/conditioner and other hair products. And from my parents got 3 DS games (Strawberry Shortcake, PacMan and Brain Age although I STILL have nothing to play it on! The pink one is impossible to find right now. I've asked 2 places and they said to check back after the Xmas rush...around New Years.),an electric paper shredder, Snow White clock, a scented Carebear, Mark Hollywood Pink perfume set (AHHH...my signature scent!), a pair of jeans, a top that looked really dreadful on me but I had to wear it anyway and I cant complain since I picked it out!) and some Alice in Wonderland underwear. I may be leaving out some things...I'm about to knock out from my Tylenol PMs. ::yawn::

Pixie loves the palace doghouse I got her! She sat on my lap while I put it together and as soon as I got it,she laid down in it and then she guarded it the rest of the night so my sister's poodle couldn't go in it. I'm so glad she likes it. She's even been sleeping in it at night instead of in my bed! When she got her old doghouse,she had it for like 2 months before she'd really sleep in it or anything. I also got her a Carebear blanket and some toys. 

Monday was fun too. We spent the entire day at my grandma's with the whole family. The boys got a mini motorcycle so my dad and my sister took them to the school to ride it around the trail. I rode it too and crashed into the fence. It was so funny and we had a good time. I drove us up there and back in my grandfather's huge van. I walked around the track 6 times which equaled a mile and a quarter. I could get used to that. I used to go jogging sometimes before I got chubby,I should get into that again. I'd love to do it a few days a week. 

It seems so quiet here tonight! Noah was here for 4 nights and Jayceon was here last night so this is the first night in a while that it's just my parents and me and it's so weird. I miss them. Today we got to the sales a little late so I didn't buy much. I got 3 rolls of wrapping paper but they're not too Christmas-y and I can use them for decos. And a bra and a pair of jeans,some dark chocolate squares (YUM! They're a tiny piece of heaven..!)and a bunch of other crapola that I wasted my $50 on. Target had a whole rack of Curious George stuff in their $1 section. *SCORE!* So I got like $14 of stationary,journals and notepads. Then I came back and watched the last disc of Six feet Under,season 3 and Lady in the Water. Which looked like it would be really good and interesting but it was so booooring and dull. Hated it. I also got Little Miss Sunshine but my sister's coming to watch it with me tomorrow so I have to wait. I'm dying to see it. I also took a 2 hour nap this evening so I'm not sleepy at all which is why I took the PMs.

I have to go back to work Thursday-Tuesday! NOOOOOOOO...."

Plus I got a cool gift from my secret santa...it's a Disney Fairies doll. It's so pretty,maybe I should collect the other 4. My boss and my secret santa recipient both loved their gifts. Well,they were to cheap to give us an actual party...no food,no drinks,no music (haha) or nothing else that resembled an actual party. Except for presents. On the plus side,I can now afford to buy the pink DS I've been wanting for so long it seems like. Actually,the girl on Laundro decided not to sell the games afterall so I'm just gonna have to buy a couple of brand new ones. I'm all done with my Christmas shopping anyways,except for a couple of things. Tomorrow,Noah has a Christmas play at school and we're going shopping after that. 

Today I sent out all my Christmas packages. <lj user=""michelletenoh"">,<lj user=""stargazer20"">,and <lj user=""burnparadise""> watch your mailboxes. :) Also sent my secret santa packages via Laundro and a yahoo group as well as a couple of wishlist requests and another batch of cards to random people on Laundro. 

I managed to score third row seats for Taylor Hicks and first row seats for Yo La Tengo. I've been downloading some stuff of theirs and I do enjoy them. After I pay my bills at the first of the month,I'll see if I should splurge on any more concert tickets this month."

"event","Okay,so as soon as I got online tonight I read in one of my LJ communities that Taylor Hicks (otherwise known as my musical guilty pleasure!) is coming to Knoxville in March. I checked the TN theatre website and it's true. Tickets go on sale Saturday morning. I have no idea how much tickets will be but I must get one. Or two. I may have to defer some of my DS money for this. Damn. If I order first thing Saturday morning,I should get a pretty good seat and I imagine these tickets will go pretty fast. He is also playing the Orange Peel in Asheville the next night. I think I may buy tickets to this one too...it's a much more intimate venue so I imagine the tickets will be cheaper and plus it is general admission so I don't have to buy the tickets right away. I should be driving by then so it won't be an issue. Dad has given me 2 lessons this week so maybe things will continue this way.  I look forward to getting my liscence so I can go to a ton of shows next year. 

I also saw that Yo La Tengo and Jeff Tweedy are coming here. I've only heard a handful of Yo La Tengo songs but I loved them so I think I may have to check this show out as well. As for the other,I used to be a pretty big Wilco fan but now their records barely hold my attention and I've never heard any of Tweedy's solo stuff...I'm not sure about this one. 

I'm watching a Morrissey documentary/concert film right now...I would die if I ever saw him live."

"event","Hi. :)

My allergies are being all annoying again. I'm out of medicine again and can't get a refill for another week and a half. Plus now I can't go to the doctor because,apparently,I no longer have insurance. I got papers saying my appeal was denied but they still paid for my medicine last month. Hmmmm. I also got a letter the other day saying that my doctor is leaving this month and moving back to California. How sad as I have went to him for so long and I really liked him. So now I have no insurance (maybe!) and no family doctor (yes!)...wow. My brother used to go to this clinic for the uninsured or whatever so when I do need to go to the doctor,I shall look into that. 

I went shopping today! I didn't spend much,I got a few more Christmas presents and boring stuff for myself (like green tea and soap).I also went to dinner at my sister's house. Yum. 

So the other night I bought five $1 scratch off lottery tickets and I won $2 and a free ticket so I got 3 more tickets and on one of those I won $50! I couldn't believe it. So awesome! I don't play much. Sometimes when we stop for gas,I buy a couple of tickets. So I am saving that until I got my $100 Treasure Trooper check (Did I mention I've made $80 already this month??) and I have $20 left from what my grandma gave me a few weeks ago so I am going to use that to buy my Nintendo DS and a game. On Laundro,some girl is going to sell me 4 DS games for $20. It seems like too good of a deal since buying them new would be like 3-4 times that much but she has excellent feedback. One of them in Nintendogs...it's not the version I wanted (Chihuahuas) but it's too good of a deal to pass up. I can't wait to get it! My TT check should be here any day now and then I'll deposit it and order it online. The pink ones are usually sold out so I'm gonna save the hassle and order online since a lot of places offer free shipping anyways. I think Amazon does.

I'm still waiting on word on as to when the work Xmas party will be. I so don't want to go but I have to in order to get my Xmas bonus! Karen said they were aiming for Thursday but to call tomorrow and confirm. Last year I got $100 and I've heard it may be more this year. Either way,I'll use that to finish my Xmas shopping and shipping. Heh. 

I got some sad news today. Hoffmans,my favorite site for candles/tarts/bath/body stuff,is closing! I ordered from them all the time. I told everyone about them. Seriously,since August when I discovered Julie's site,our house and myself have smelled unbelievably awesome thanks to her. I've got quiet a bit of extra stuff (enough to last a while!) but I'm out of a lot of my favorite scents. She mentioned they'd be having an out of business sale very soon and I hope I can order a TON of stuff then. I'm so sad! I'm gonna miss ordering from her because her products were so amazing and so cheap and...::tear::

I am still somehow managing to be behind on everything...I have 3 Netflix to watch, 2 weeks worth of my favorite shows to catch up on, another batch of Xmas cards to mail out, gifts to package and wrap, letters to write,etc etc etc. Bad Heather!"

I was just browsing through my friends page and saw a post in one of my Jenny Lewis communities that she was going to be on Jimmy Kimmel Live and I remember reading it weeks ago so I flipped it on the channel just as she was being introduced. ::dances:: I adore her so much. Damn,I wish I could see her on this tour! When Rilo Kiley tours next year,I'm going to every date in the south. Heh...well,maybe not but that would be nice. 

Oooh,so I made around $100 on Treasure Trooper this month. That will come in really handy in a few weeks! I have loads more pending,I hope the offers will approve. I should get my check in mid-December and I've already earned $3 toward next month. I should have stayed online all day doing offers since today was the last day of the month. Hehe.

Since I finally got ink for my printer,I made a bunch of decos today but I'm too lazy to scan them.

I've felt so down the past few days. I'm starting to feel like I need to make some decisions soon. Like after I quit my job,what am I gonna do? I'll be able to draw unemployment checks. That won't be much but it will be something. Plus I should be able to make some money with online selling and my paid to sites. I've been thinking and last year I got laid off the 3rd week in December. I then worked from the day after Christmas till the 3rd of January. Then they called me back for a couple of days a week starting in mid-February. In order to not fuck with my employment checks I'll have to work that week in January. I have to get my liscence. I cannot avoid it any longer. Then I'll just not go back when they call me in February...right? I should be able to find another before March. Ahhh,I'm still working on a plan. I cannot go back to work there next year. No way. And I can't just be all ""Fuck you-I quit!!"" because then they can cut out my money...I know because they did that to my friend Johnny last winter. I'm just so unhappy and I want out of this rut.

I've been fighting with my dad a lot lately. He's been so harsh lately and he just drops all these comments designed to piss me off. I am so sick of being compared to other people. No one takes me seriously. Another thing,I talked about going to NC for the Ted Leo show nonstop for weeks and then on Friday I told them I wasn't going. They didn't ask me why. Not a single person asked me why I decided not to go. Not even my sister...she didn't even ask me if I went. I'm sure she'd already asked my mom about it though. I wonder what she told her. No one in this family listens to me. I'm tired of being here at everyone else's disposal. No one asks me about my life. I'm so tired of my parents only talking to me about my brother and sister. Seriously,my mom tells me like every single thing my brother or sister in law and the baby says or does...even stupid, lame,completely uninteresting things that I could never possibly care about in a thousand years. God,they barely even talk to me and I barely talk to them....I don't care what they had for breakfast this morning or what they got in the mail or which pair of pajamas the baby slept in last night! Geez. I considered talking to her about this but she would just take it the wrong way and make me out to be some kind of monster or something. It's not that I'm jealous. I have valid reasons for the way I feel towards them. I feel so invisible sometimes in this family. This is why I don't want to have kids. I don't want the competition and all the shit that comes along with it. When I do move away...I wonder what will happen. I can't help but wonder if they would just forget all about me. 

Anyways...I opted to stay home today. I slept till 3 this afternoon. I worked on mail and downloaded the new Gwen Stefani cd and did some offers on TT and signed a few Christmas cards and watched movies. I also watched Gilmore Girls/Veronica Mars from last week. And tonight I watched The Class...oh my god,I cried at the end. It was so sweet when Leena came in her wheelchair and Richie got out of the car and they hugged. Awwww. They're so cute and I want a Richie. I love this show. I can't get enough of it. Oooh and I just read an article that said The OC was cancelled. I pretty much knew this was going to be the last season but it was still sad. 

I got a new credit card today. Tommorow I'm gonna go buy some ink for my printer and I really want to get a Nintendo DS. I've been planning to get one for a while so I think I'm just gonna put it on the card. I want a pink one. You get free shipping by ordering on Amazon so I think I'm just gonna go with that since sometimes they're sold out at Wal-Mart. But on ToysRUs.com they have a lot of cheap games so I might order from there. While on toysrus.com I browsed through the toys and I want to get this for my nephew Jack: http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2298888&cp=&fbn=Brand+Name+Secondary%7CFisher-Price&f=Taxonomy%2FTRUS%2F2254197&f=PAD%2FBrand+Name+Secondary%2FFisher-Price&fbc=1&kw=zebra&parentPage=search  His birthday is Saturday. I saw them at Wal-mart though so I'm just gonna get it there since it was $10 cheaper. I'm not getting my brother or Terri anything because they never buy anyone gifts. My parents keep saying things like ""Poor Jason and Terri won't be able to buy any gifts this year since he lost his job. It's gonna be a sad xmas for them..."" -they've never gotten anyone Christmas gifts!!! Last year they both had jobs. And they're really mean and unappreciative about what they do get. I feel bad not getting anything for the baby so I think I'm gonna get him something anyway. Terri is so picky she only lets him play and wear certain things. Haha. But I want to buy baby toys. :) This looks cute: http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2265219

"event","After sleeping for a full three hours last night,we ventured out at 4 am this morning. We got to west Knoxville about 20 minutes before 5 and dropped my sister off at Toy R Us. Then Dad drove me and Jacob to Best Buy. Big mistake. There were at least two thousand people in line. I am not exaggerating. It was madness. Best Buy is in a building with 2 other stores. The line for Best Buy was wrapped clear around those two stores and completely around the entire building...it was insane. The people toward the front had coolers and chairs and sleeping bags and people were passing out coffee. So we stood in the line till about 10 after 5. It was moving along,slowly. But if we'd stayed in that line,we would have missed the other stores so we just left. I can understand waiting for hours and sleeping outside for a cheap computer or TV or something but it's so not worth it for a few dirt cheap DVDs. No way. 

At Goodys I got a $10 gift card because they gave them out to the first 300 people. Woo. So I got a few gifts there...they had these $50 coats on sale for $9.99 so I got one for my dad and my grandpa and I got my nephews jeans that were on sale. Then we drove back down to Toys R Us and picked up my sister and went to Target. Target had a huge line too but it looked TINY compared to Best Buy's. Haha. Once they opened,we got in very quickly. I knew what I was after and I got it. Haha. The people weren't vicious or anything as is the Black Friday cliche. I got 12 DVDs and a few video games. Woo. Awesome deals. Anyways,Brandy didn't want to go in Target so Dad told them to go on to Wal-Mart. Big mistake. I was out of there in like 10 minutes. Haha. Then we stood out on the sidewalk in the cold for about 45 minutes till they came back to get us. Then they took me to Wal-Mart. I didn't find anything there. I was mostly interested in the DVDs because they had a bunch for $1.88 and $2.88 but all the cheap ones were gone...oh well. 

Then we ate breakfast and went back to Best Buy. It was like nine o'clock by then. The line was still wrapped about halfway around the building. FOUR hours after the sale started! Whoa. They couldn't have even had that much stuff left by then! So,yeah,I learned one lesson for next year: Best Buy=Black Friday shopping online. I won't even attempt that again unless it's for something massively cheap.

So after we got home I decided to check out the online deals. Didn't find much. I ordered a couple of the DVDs I wanted at Best Buy- so it wasn't a total loss. Heh. Then I saw that Hoffmans was having a buy one get one free sale on all tarts so I ordered a slew of those for a secret santa Christmas thing. And then I ordered two more tee shirts from Threadless since I had a $10 credit there. 

Then I put on my PJs and went back to bed. I slept about 4 hours. I hope I can go to sleep easy tonight. My inner clock is gonna be so fucked up. Haha. I have to work tomorrow and then my vacation is supposed to start on Sunday. Seven days of freedom. Woo. The weather is supposed all sunny and warm Sunday...I'd love to go somewhere for the day."

I procrastinated on everything till tonight.I didn't get home from my cousin's birthday party till 10 because we had to go take my brother and his family home and go to Wal-Mart for hamster supplies. I cleaned like a crazy person for hours it seemed like plus did 4 loads of laundry and colored my hair. I used the same temp dye I used a few weeks ago because I had over half a bottle left. It looks a more...vibrant(?) this time. I don't know. It's more noticable. I think. It's 2 am and this isn't the best light. Haha. Anyways I am anxious to see how today plays out. All the family is coming here for lunch so there's gonna be about 20 or so people here. Then we're going to my other grandparents' house for dinner. I haven't seen them since spring so I'm sort of looking forward to that. I'm gonna be crazy with that many of my relatives tomorrow. I'm sure I'll be a wreck by tomorrow night. 

However,I shall try my best to use tomorrow to reflect on how amazing my life is and how much more amazing it's going to get. And that's not entirely sarcasm...I want to mean it. I do love my family. Some more so than others...haha. A few of them (like my sister in law) I'd rather pull my toenails out one by one than spend an entire day in the prescence of. Anyways, I am thankful for all the things that make me feel better...Pixie,all my online friends, Livejournal,music, everything."

"event","Hmmm. Okay,so early this year I was obsessed with this Get Paid To (do surveys,enter contests,join sites,other simple stuff!) site and I made a small chunk of money (ehh..about $100)for wasting like an extra 10 minutes online each night. I got pissed off and quit doing it when I used my credit card to do one of the offers and then they didn't give me credit for it. I ordered some business cards or something and was supposed to get like $15 for ordering like $6 worth of them. I actaully needed the cards so it wasn't a total loss but it pissed me off and I avoided the site for a long time. I've been doing it again for the past week or so and I've earned $35 so far with about $50 or so pending. Anyways so they had 2 Blockbuster movie rental offers...one paid out $25 and the other $18. I heard that these approved quickly and of course I clicked the one for $25...NOT the free one. The other one was for a 2 week FREE trial. The $25 one was to get your first month of service for $10. I did it about 24 hours ago and it still hasn't approved!!! Grrr. Since I already paid for the month,I am going to keep it. Apparently they have this really cool thing where you can return your online rentals back to their real store and you can rent a movie there and they mail the other one for you. So wouldn't that be like twice the rentals? Like,a better deal than Netflix? It sounds like it. The only problem is...I don't use Blockbuster. There's one about 15 minutes from my house but we never go that way so it would be totally out of the way to go there. And I mostly only use Netflix to avoid going to the video store because it's such a hassle for me since I don't drive and...yeah. So yeah I guess I'll be getting a lot of DVDs this month! Woo. The first thing I ordered was Six Feet Under: Season 2. Anyways,the site is a great way to make a little extra cash and any money earned before the end of this month,you'll get paid for the 3rd week of December-just in time for Christmas. And you make money from anybody you refer. *hint*hint*    http://www.treasuretrooper.com/20579 

So...I might be on my week's paid vacation right now. Yes,I don't even know. God,I hate those people at work!!! Right off the bat,I was only scheduled to work 3 days this week. We aren't busy at all. So I gave up on my boss/supervisor and went to the main boss there on Sunday...one of the two guys that OWN it and are over like every little last thing. I requested my vacation this week. I figured it would be NO problem since we are not busy at all and they have more than enough people to cover everything. He said it would be no problem to take it this week but he would have to double check with my boss that she would not need me,that she had enough people to cover it,and that he would get back with me later that day since she was off and he needed to call her. He left and didn't tell me anything. See,I've been asking for my time off for weeks...I've asked like 5 different times specifically and mentioned it like a million times since July. So I figured they would let me know today when I went to pick up my check. They didn't. He wasn't there and my boss was off somewhere else. I didn't get the pay for a week off. I only got my regular check. I figured if I was gonna get to be off this week,they'd just add it on to my check since this is what they had done to the other girls. I know for a fact that I won't get it next week because we are booked solid for 3 days so far. It's so annoying!!! Like why is it this hard? Everyone else got their vacations as soon as they requested them. I've been begging for mine for like 6 months!!! Like I'd originally planned to take it in August and we were gonna go to the beach or something...NO way,they had to mess that up! A few weeks ago I even volunteered to work my days,for them to just give me the week's pay and I would work if they needed me. I'm getting laid off in like 3 weeks...time is running out for this ""vacation"" and I fucking want it. I fucking earned it. What if they refuse to give it to me??? I don't know what to do. I don't know who else to ask. 

I finally have a day tomorrow with NO plans. I don't have to be anywhere,go anywhere,do anything,nothing. I'm staying in and watching movies and writing letters and playing with decos and sorting through my Christmas music. Last year I burned all my Christmas themed MP3s onto a cd and now there's like a 100 or more songs on there and I've forgotten all of them. Yay,that will be fun. Hehe. 

We're gonna have our big Thanksgiving Day stuff at our house this year. We've went to my grandparents house EVERY year so this is gonna be wierd. We've gotta do some hardcore cleaning and everything because like 25 people are gonna be here and it's gonna be crazy. Ehh. I'm not looking forward to it that much...well,I am a little I guess..it's just more of the fact that I'll be glad when it's over with. I am excited for Black Friday though. Wooo. I love that day. All the competitive shopping...it's a dream. Haha. :D

I went to Taget tonight and I charged $40 to my card. I had a 10% off card too but I forgot to bring it. Grrr. I've had it for about 3 weeks and I've been saving it for Black Friday but I blew it tonight. Oh well. I've still got a lot left on it though. Meh.

I bought my Christmas cards tonight too! I thought I bought a lot of them when they were so cheap last year but I DIYd them all away except for one box. I got some awesome ones but I won't tell what kind so as not to blow it for all you who will be getting one. :) I got a roll of Hello Kitty paper too so I can wrap the gifts I've gotten so far. Haha,my mom buys like spongebob/elmo/pooh paper for the kids ,girly pink and bows and whatever for the girls,lame and dull ""manly"" paper...all kinds for each like style and it's so funny. I just wrap everyone's in Hello Kitty,even my grandpa's. :)Last year everyone got My Little Pony."

"event","Wow,this has been a busy couple of days. I just got back from the Chattanooga trip tonight. It was kind of a bust. Well,mostly in the sense that it didn't last long enough. I worked Wednesday and Thursday. After I got off Thursday,we had to go run a few errands and then we rushed home to get packed. Our original plan was to leave early Thursday morning but we got stuck working because we didn't request the day,we asssumed we have it because we're always off on Thursdays. Anyways so we managed to leave at like 5 o'clock and then it was like 6:30 before we got out of Knoxville. Their insterstates are so messed up with construction and everything that traffic is a nightmare most of the time. After we got there we drove around the city a bit and ate dinner at Wendys,the only restaurant we could find that was open. We had failed to do much planning around and the only hotels in the area we were going to were really fancy,really nice ones. So we drove around and finally found a place. Our hotel was cheap but it was really nice. I'm usually super picky about everything when I stay in a hotel since I've worked at one for so long but this one was so clean and nice and the employees were so much friendlier than we are here. Haha. I did remember to leave a tip for the maid this time. Last time I traveled,I forgot to and I still feel bad about it! Yes,I've been working in hospitality for too long. Always remember to tip your maid!

Anyways so today we mostly drove around and went shopping. We mostly stopped at stores that my mom and Brandy wanted to stop at. Like I saw a Morning Glory store and I've never been to one of those and I told them to stop and they just kept driving. So annoying! But I did pick up a few Christmas presents. I didn't buy too much. I tried to control myself! I only bought 2 sweaters and some deco/art crap for myself. Oh yeah,I also got a storage box thing to put all my oversized postcards in...it has postcards and maps all over it and it's so perfect. I also found a place that sold Diddl stationary and I got a whole bunch of notepads and paper. Woo. But I didn't find anywhere that sold postcards. :( We had decided to stay another because I wanted to go to see Rock City's Christmas thing. Well,my sister didn't want to so we came home. She was like in a total hurry to get home and then we got here and she just sat around here for 4 hours doing nothing. Totally pissed me off. I think I'm the only one in my family who honestly likes to travel. Plus they never want to stop at the places I do or go the places that I want to visit and it's so annoying.

Did I mention I got like no sleep? My adorable baby nephew Jack showed his bad side and cried like all night. He was sick though so that's why. He's usually so calm. Plus he kept kicking and tiickling me all night. It was annoying but funny. Plus I'm used to going to bed really late and they all went to bed at like eleven o'clock and I had no choice but to because they turned the lights out.

By the time we got home tonight,I felt so bad. I had a killer headache and was like really weak and hurting all over and was freezing. I had a fever too. I checked it about 2 hours ago and it's normal again. I have all the allergy-ish symptoms again. I feel better,but still 'off'...like I'm getting sick. I haven't eaten much at all today either. Now I have an annoying toothache too. I'm supposed to work tomorrow but if I am not feeling much better,I'm staying home. They can give my hours to someone who kisses enough ass to deserve it. I am so sick of my job. I just want to be laid off already. I'm lucky to get 25 hours a week right now anyways so what's an extra day,right? GRRR. I hate almost every minute I am there and I've gotten so distant from everyone. I can't let it slip that I plan on not coming back in February/March/whenever they decide to call me back because then they can cut off my unemployment money. Or so I've heard. I just want it over and done. I'm ready to move on. It's getting so close too. Probably only a few more days. 

I'm not sure that I'm going to the Ted Leo show next week. Lot of reasons-the number one being that money is tight right now. I'm sure I'd have fun but I don't feel up to going alone either to some dingy bar or whatever. Then there's the ride situation. I keep checking but there's no more good show coming here anytime soon so this would probably be my only show for a while. John Mayer is coming in March,but tickets are like $50. Crappy seats are that price. I don't think I'm a big enough fan to pay that much."

"event","I laid out of work today. Well,technically,I didn't lay out because I was sick. My allergies have been a nightmare for the past few days...I am very sure it is my allergies and not just a cold because I have every single typical allergy symptom. I managed to work Thursday and Friday by swallowing Claritins and Benadryl and Tylenols continously and using eye drops almost every hour. I didn't manage to rest at all and my sleep schedule is all over the place as usual. I am all out of my Flonase but I managed to find a new sample sized bottle from a few months ago so I started using it. It's a different brand but it said it should start working as soon as you use it whereas it takes Flonase a few days before you can tell a difference. I get sick every time I go off of it but it's the only allergy medicine my insurance will pay for and right now I can't afford anything extra. So my doctor reccommended Claritin and I've been taking it for a few days now. It caused insomnia when I was on it a few years ago so I stopped taking it but I haven't been able to tell a difference in my nonexistant sleep schedule this time. I want to switch doctors after I get my liscence. Right now I use the same doctor as my mom and have for about 3 years. But he's not even that much older than me and he's hot and I'd be much more comfortable with an older,unattractive doctor. Haha. 

So we'd had plans to go to Dollywood on Friday for a few weeks and even though I definately did not feel like it,I went. I didn't want to be a party pooper. :) The weather was perfect (it was in the 70s yesterday) and it wasn't too crowded and the Christmas fest started this week. It was so much fun. I always love going there. We've been 3 times already this year. But now all my free passes are used up. I hope I'll be able to get free passes wherever I am working next year. They're building a new rollercoaster to open in the spring. It looks awesome. Speaking of which,we rode the one rollercoaster like 12 times in a row! When you go down the first big fall they take your picture and every time my sister and I would make a funny face or give a thumbs up or something dumb. It was really fun. I wore my ""Imposter"" tee shirt from Threadless with the skeletons on it and it glowed in the dark! I didn't know it and everyone kept pointing at me and I felt like an idiot with my ""HEY! LOOK AT ME!"" shirt on.  We stayed till closing and then went out to eat and back to my grandmother's house and it was about midnight when we got home. I went straight to bed and didn't get up till noon today. 

I woke up feeling a lot better and then she called and asked if I wanted to come along with them to the zoo in Knoxville. So I did. It was all rainy and gross and cold outside but it was fun. I haven't been there in years. I ran out of money before we got to the gift shop and my purse was in the car so I didn't get to buy any postcards. :( I only had a little on me and I had got each of the kids a stuffed otter and Pixie a treat. After that we went to Burger King for dinner. You know,I think the zoo would be a fun place to work! I should look into that kind of work. I don't get on too well with people,maybe I'd be better off with animals? Haha. 

Laundro is still down and I've got some stuff I wanted to sell on there. I was hoping to make a few extra bucks for the Chattanooga trip this week! Crap. 

I have to go back to work tomorrow....I don't want to! Grrrrrrrrrr.

My new Jenny/Blake icon makes me all warm inside. I love them so much."

"event","Most likely in a subconscious (sp?) attempt to avoid my NaNo novel,I've written 3 letters today. I'm actually not that behind as I think I only owe about 6 or so. I love penpalling but as most of my penpals know,I am slow sometimes! I just can't bring myself to write a letter at times. I don't know why as I do enjoy it so much! I just like to procrastinate. I also told myself that I cannot do any more decos until I work on my stack of letters. 

I'm still taking the cough medicine which makes me all drowsy and lazy. I feel like I've been in a daze today. It took me hours to clean my room and it wasn't even dirty. I've accomplished absolutely nothing today aside from laundry,cleaning and writing. I wish I had registered to vote! I regret it now. I am definately going to register before next year. The senate race is very tight and very nasty here in TN and I fear the republican Bob Corker (who seems like a total dirtbag) is going to win. He reminds me too much of Bush. However,I cannot complain since I was a bad American and didn't vote."

"event","God,I am so bored. I really shouldn't be. I have letters I need to write, DVDs I need to watch, I've got like 10 books I need to finish reading,tons of decos and slams to sign,a NaNo novel to work on...there's a million things I could be doing but instead I am sitting here at the computer whining. It's more like I feel like I should be doing else. I enojoy not working but I don't enjoy spending all my time at home either. Not that I haven't left home in days (I have!)it's just that I've spent a lot more time at home this week than I'm used to. My mom went to my aunt's to have a yard sale today and I didn't go because I didn't want to get up at 6 and I knew I'd be bored stiff if I had to sit over there until tonight. I'd like to go over there this afternoon but I can't because Dad's going straight over there when he gets off later. Now I'm gonna be stuck here all day and all night. 
 
I've had a bad cough for days. I just woke up with it and I really have no other symptoms,aside from normal occasional allergy crap. So I had some leftover prescription cough medicine from a few months ago so I took some of it last night. I hate taking it because it knocks me out and,sure enough,I slept for almost 12 hours. 

I hate cooking but I made some oatmeal for breakfast. It was a little dry but it was okay. Then I took Pixie for a walk and got the mail. Today was an awesome mail day! I got the new Bright Eyes cd that someone burned for me, 3 postcards, a few crap things (CC statement, doubleday catalog, another dumb catalog), and my Veronica Mars DVDs. Then I came back inside and someone knocked on the door and it freaked me out (I always get kinda nervous when I'm home alone...I've watched too much Fox News!) and it was the UPS guy. I got my 4 Threadless tee shirts! Ahhh,I love them. 

I'm listening to the newest Dashboard Confessional cd. I bought it when it first came out and listened to it like once so I decided to give it another shot. It's not doing anything for me...it sounds a lot like their other stuff,maybe a little more boring? That's too harsh. Ehhh,I think I'll burn a copy for myself and sell the original. Or not.

Well,I am off to find something productive to do."

"event","I am off work again today. After working for like over 3 weeks with only one day off,last week I was off 3 days. So far I have been off 2 days already this week and I know I'm off Friday and I may get even more days. See,that is the main thing I hate about my job! It's not steady enough. Like they will work you to death for a while and then they won't let you work any for a while. It's so annoying. I only got in 23 hours last week. And another thing...you're supposed to get one week's paid vacation after you've been there for a year. Well,I was there for a year in July. Since then,I have asked for my vacation three times and they always have an excuse as to why I can't take it. Back in August,I was sick and I had my regular days off so I was off for 6 days and I aksed my boss if that could be counted as my vacation and she said no. So I worked that Saturday for a grand total of THREE hours that week. WTF? Right now we are really slow and they have enough people hired in to cover it but they still won't give me my vacation.  I have asked my boss if I could take it the second week in November because we have to go to Chattanooga for a couple of days and she still hasn't given me a definite aswer. I plan to quit in January and what if they still haven't let me have it by then? What can I do?

I still don't have any definite plans for tonight. I think I'm supposed to go with my sis to take the boys trick or treating. Pixie has her spiderman (and Cinderella!) costume and I'd like to take her somewhere. If not,I'll just stay home and watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show and deco. 

Yesterday I watched half of the first season of Six Feet Under from Netflix. Does anyone else watch this? I love it. I finally found the first season of Veronica Mars for cheap. I had been checking every Wal Mart and Target I go to and they only had season 2 so I finally got it on Ebay for $23 shipped which wasn't bad. I guess I'll ask for season 2 for Christmas since it's like $50. I also got Friends,Season 1 for $12 shipped which is even cheaper than it was at McKays. Score! 

God,I'm starving. I'm gonna call Mom and have her bring me home some Taco Bell."

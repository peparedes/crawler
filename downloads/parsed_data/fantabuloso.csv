"event","You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
Weakened by my soulful cries.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise."

"event","if you have to love, don't. especially if the one you're going to love someone doesn't love you back. unrequited love must not fill a space in your existence. unrequited love sucks, hurts and kills. if you find yourself thinking about someone and his sweetness, although you know he's naturally sweet to all girls, and his sweetness to you doesn't mean anything, then don't think about him. don't be too assuming that he's checking out on you is a sign that he has a thing for you. don't read between the lines of the sweet text messages he sent to you. don't dwell on the memories that you had with him because most definitely, he is not dwelling on them, either.

don't fall for him. to fall in love with him will be an awful blow to your vulnerable emotions because surprise! surprise! he wouldn't reciprocate the feelings. he is just sweet, remember?

if you think you're crushing on someone who seems to be having a thing for your friend, and your friend seems to be crushing on the guy too bigtime, take the backseat. don't squeeze yourself in the picture. boogie out the scene that is designated for only the two of them. at this point, don't take the risk of falling for the guy in hope that maybe it's not your friend he's attracted with, but you. that won't work. assuming that someone loves you is the most stupid reason for propelling oneself to love. so don't assume. and if it happens that you really don't, but you have the urge to love the guy anyway, because whoa, the guy is a catch, try your hardest to control the feeling. the worst thing that can happen is finding yourself very heartbroken from seeing your friend and your prospect together. if you are totally crushing on a classmate, and you're nothing but his friend who buys tickets from his organization just for his sake, then for the love of yourself, bop yourself until you realize that you have to let go of that classmate. don't skip class because you're afraid you're going to see the two of them sitting beside each other. look at the guy in a different light. say, notice how he doesn't match up to your ideal guy standard anyway because he dresses so lousily-something like that. for pete's sake, it's just a crush you say. but dear, more often than not, crush leads to love. better stop now than endure a thousandfold pain later.

love is the sweetest thing, i know. it's the greatest feeling. that is, if the one you love loves you back. there can't be anything better than that. but if the situation is wherein you're falling for someone who just considers you as a friend, that's a different story. as much as possible, evade from those heart wrenching situations. love is hard to control, but try anyway. give your best shot at falling out of love or not falling at all. you're lucky if you detect the absurdity and the pain of unrequited love right away because it spares you from going through a lot of hell. all you have to do is simply occupy yourself with other things. have fun with your life. you will fall soon and this time, you will not get hurt, because he will reciprocate the feelings. it will not be now, but it will come in due time.

love is all about sacrifice, giving one's self freely, with no strings attached, you say. hell, i know that. i know love is supposed to work that way. love is really supposed to hurt, but that's what makes love love.

but this is my stand. and i know you respect that. love has pained me so much to actually believe that it is better to have not loved at all.

it's so easy to think about love, to talk about love. but it's not always easy to recognize love ... even when we already hold it in our hands."

"event","it's a friday night and i'm at home in front of the computer updating my live journal. that does not sound like the doing of a party princess to me. hah! what is it with me these days? i'm sick again. i've been sick since wednesday morning. i thought my little stint with the flu was due to the stress of hell week. but just when i was getting ready to leave for tugon's mid-year evsem, i fall flat on my face with fever and colds. just in the midst of planning one last hurrah before the second sem starts. boohoo. i've been drugged with tempra and biogesic and alaxan. all the planning for galera and fuego down the drain. sorry mia. maybe christmas break would be better.

i think it would definitely be better for me if we postpone our little beach outing. haha. benificial for me. i am still on a quest to find the perfect bikini. and thanks to kellda, i now have immediate access to the stores in the states. haha. thanks kellds! i've been surfing the net for the absolute perfect one. i'd shop in the stores here if only the sizes weren't so ... what's the word? obstructive. yah. that's the word i was looking for.

it's a good thing you can mix and match sizes though. if that wasn't allowed. shet. haha. i'm in big trouble. i'd be getting two pairs of bikinis in two sizes just to match. potah. i hate my body. sooo ... not proportioned. i never thought i'd say this but i wish i was ... umm ... less on top and more on the bottom. haha! if i could surgically do that i would. it'd make life so much easier. haaay ambot.

okay. ange and i have been planning to hit the gym for the longest time. but it's never happened. i think i mentioned to her that we should probably head back for the gym midway through the first sem. what happened? nothing. work just took on a life of it's own and we just got drowned with the tons of papers to write and other crap to do. i think i'm going to start second sem. yeah ... i think the trick is to start at the very beginning of the sem just so i can get my schedule down. once i fix my schedule, i'm sure i'll be well on my way to having a lean mean fighting machine body. haaay. those were the good old days. muesli and milk. tuna and crackers. step aerobics. circuit training. okay! focus! i want those abs. yup. just like britney spears. when the instructor asks me what my goal is, i'll have to say: BRITNEY SPEARS. haha.

speaking of my schedule, i've found myself in a dilemma. did i spell that right? anyway. so i'm feeling pretty good that i can finally get out of strebel's philo class for the second sem. i didn't think trying to get into another class would be so difficult. so here's the story. originally, i was under cleofas' class and she was a pretty good teacher as far as i could tell. i wasn't an A student in her class but at least i wasn't failing. anyway, it was just too bad (and i do mean this in an extremely sincere way) that she got too sick to continue teaching the class. so strebel took over. i was hoping she'd be well enough to come back to teach for the second sem but then again that really wouldn't matter now, would it? as it turns out, i have two lab classes for the second sem that i totally forgot about. well that really isn't my fault since i left reuel to pick my philo and my theo classes for me since he lined up for me and all. so anyway, we had ""forgotten"" (really) about the second sem lab classes so we signed up for an afternoon philo class. me, jan, and reuel are all in trouble now. we have two labs that are both in the afternoons that will fall either on a monday, a wednesday, or a friday. so there. conflict in schedule. what to do? turns out the original ""cleofas"" classes that were turned over to other teachers will NOT be using cleofas' syllabus for the second sem so i now have to choose a class that will closely resemble cleofas' would by syllabus. okay, i'll just let the philo department handle that.

i just lit another cigarette. i should really cut down. i smoke too much. i think partly the reason why i'm sick now is because i smoke too much. in an attempt to cut down, i bought way too expensive cigarettes. i bought the superslim ones, menthol. hay naku. i thought it would help. nope. no help given.

i could hear the television in the other room. what's with reality-based artista searches these days? shoot. i'm not bitter. just ... hahaha! it's a comedy show! i'm not even in the room and i'm laughing. try to watch it. you'll feel better after watching it if not horrified."

The Uptown Girl

I've been rich and I've been poor. Rich is better. 
-- Sophie Tucker
If her last name is a household word, like Disney or Kellogg, chances are she's an Uptown Girl with a trust fund the size of Texas. But it isn't wealth that defines the Uptown Girl, it's breeding and decorum (unless she's a Party/Uptown hybrid like those Wild On royals or the aristobrat child of a celebrity). A true Uptown Girl has Park Avenue taste and the manners of Emily Post, at least when Mummy is watching. 

The Uptown Girl is a challenge -- one that requires a little more, well, money. Menus in this chapter are going to cost you more than the others because you will need a few premium ingredients to get this Girl's attention (read: oysters, caviar, and very expensive Champagne). If this is really the type of girl that you are after, you're probably used to this already. If you don't have the budget to support her tastes, we would suggest becoming a musician. Seems like those guys can always get women to buy them groceries. 

She Might Be an Uptown Girl if: 

She drives: a Jaguar, a Porsche, or a Rolls-Royce, or a limo with a driver and tinted, bulletproof windows. 
She can talk for more than ten minutes about: being a debutante. 
She begins her sentences with: ""When we were on Martha's Vineyard..."" 
She'd never: fly coach. 
She owns any of the following: an exotic toy breed dog, Waterford crystal, anything from Tiffany's, real pearls.

The Party Girl

I like to have a martini, two at the very most -- after three I'm under the table; after four, I'm under the host. -- Dorothy Parker
Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's is the quintessential Party Girl. Truman Capote named her for a woman who creates a holiday of life, and who takes it lightly. That classic scene of her standing in front of Tiffany's eating her breakfast roll and sipping coffee after being out on the town all night, her fridge with nothing in it, those wild cocktail parties. All very Party Girl. 

New York City is also very Party Girl. As are LA, Miami Beach, London, Amsterdam, and of course, Vegas, baby, Vegas. Party Girls hate rural areas, because their worst nightmare is to be somewhere where there's nothing going on. The Party Girl is an extrovert, and she's usually very popular. If you're the kind of guy who likes to spend his Saturday nights watching DVDs or playing Scrabble, the Party Girl may be an unwise choice. She likes to have F-U-N. 

If you want to keep up with this girl, you will need to know how to make a killer margarita, how to cure a hangover, and how to find the energy not to pull a wet-blanket, negatron move like falling asleep by the fifth club of the evening. (The answer to that last one is to have another vodka and Red Bull.) 

She Might Be a Party Girl if: 

She drives: a convertible or other sports car, or she rides on a ""party bus"" (you know, the ones that take you from bar to bar). Also: cabs and limousines. 
She can talk for more than ten minutes about: the hottest bars, restaurants, and clubs -- in short, ""the scene."" 
She begins her sentences with: ""Make it a double."" 
She'd never: take up knitting. 
She owns any of the following: cell phone, PDA or Filofax (to manage all her contacts), a sleeping mask and earplugs (since she often doesn't come home until the wee hours), travel-size toothbrushes and very dark sunglasses (for when she doesn't come home at all)."

"event","i just came home from a day out with my kids from cribs. the director person said it was important as volunteers that we'd take time out to bring the kids around. all they usually get to see are the four walls of the compound, nothing much of the outside world. so more or less it's our job to assist them in any way possible. our proposal: a babies' day out.

the call time was 7:30 am. i actually woke up pretty early but since i got tamad, i left the house around 7:20 and got to school around 7:40. of course i had to look as if i was rushing! haha! no need. everyone else was late anyway. why is that though? pinoy time is always 30 minutes after the agreed-upon time. nakakahiya! if you were in some other country and you pulled a ""pinoy time"" on them, i don't think that would be acceptable.

anyway, the drive to the place was pretty ... well, slow (for a lack of a better word). i was tailing the head van which contained all the babies so i guess that would account for the 40 kph speed. imagine! haha! we were in the highway and we were going 40 kph! fine fine fine, anything for the babies!

the place was awesome! haha! it was a clubhouse in a village somewhere in fairview. i can't really remember the name but the pool was huge and we were the only ones occupying the place. there was even a slide and a lifeguard watch tower. haha! butch and i pulled a fiasco over the baywatch running scene! hahaha! imagine that!

naturally everyone wanted to jump in as soon as we got there. the sun was up pretty high and it was soooo hot. one problem though: i didn't bring my suit! i didn't want to go swimming but when i saw the pool, i was like, ""shucks, sayang!"" i forgot how fun it is to swim with the babies! or to teach them how to! good thing i was in shorts so i could sit with the babies in the shallow part of the pool. shucks. i never knew they made special diapers that go in the pool! hahaha! it was so cute! all of them had those hot pink diapies! anyway, my first baby (jeremy) kept on crying the whole morning! he wouldn't stop! me and jay kept on trying to make him stop but the boy was just too irritated with something. here, have a look.

<img src=""http://files.hipstir.com/photos//222789/1018200433317814.jpg"">

so the ates from cribs took jeremy away to put him to sleep so that he'll be less cranky in the afternoon. so i was baby-less for about a minute or two. and then i got my hands on lance, the ultimate thumbsucker. i swear to god, the boy wouldn't let go out his thumb! you'd think it was artificially flavored with chocolate or something. he'd put the left thumb in, suck. take it out. and then he'd switch to the right thumb. suck. it's a cycle i tell you!

<img src=""http://files.hipstir.com/photos//222789/1018200433412564.jpg"">

everyone was getting pretty tired from all the swimming and all the running around. we had champorado for a morning snack. okay, initially, the kids were the only ones who were allowed to eat champorado. hahaha. but i couldn't resist it! i had't had champorado for the looongest time! yummy! i love homemade champorado!no instant champorado for me! after the morning snack all babies settled down for their naps. at last! a break for the ""grown-ups"" to make chica! of course chica turned to lunch and then the babies woke up already so ""adult"" time was cut short.

i left earlier than the others, but all in all, i'd say it was a pretty good day for us and for the babies. i was glad to have spent some time with the kids after a long time of not attending area. the acads just got so hectic all of a sudden. but anyway. i'm committed to these children and i love spending time with them. i could never imagine how their parents had the heart to give them up! awww ... i want to adopt one. i've got my heart set on a little baby girl who looks as if she can model for precious moments. seriously!

"event","For my money, the key scene in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" -- the moment on which Michael Moore's blistering yet frustratingly blunt object of a movie hinges -- is when President Bush first hears that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center and that the United States is under attack. He was at a photo op in Florida, remember, reading ""My Pet Goat"" to a schoolroom full of children, and his expression of pole-axed confusion is by now a matter of public iconography.

But Moore got his hands on all the footage, and he time-lapses us through the entire seven minutes that the president sat in that classroom and, knowing terrorists were using passenger planes as missiles on innocent Americans, stared like a stuffed deer into space. We've recently learned that this was around the time Vice President Dick Cheney was ordering fighter planes to shoot down the hijacked jets and our government's emergency-response mechanisms were convulsing with chaos. You look at Bush, whose circuitry seems quite simply to have overloaded, and think, ""This is the leader of the free world?""

Moral scorn can be a beautiful thing. Beautifully patriotic, too -- one thinks of Joseph Welch asking Senator Joseph McCarthy, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?"" And for many people who are deeply unhappy with the current administration and the war it has chosen to wage, the wish for someone to come along and articulate that scorn has acquired desperate proportions.

Of such things are 15-minute standing ovations and top prizes at the Cannes Film Festival made, as well as cheering premieres in New York and Los Angeles. ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" which opens to-day in New York and locally on Friday, has been so feverishly anticipated, in fact, that some audiences will be willing to ignore the film's lapses, the better to embrace its energizing rhetoric. That would be a mistake. ""Fahrenheit"" is worth the wait, but it should come with a label: ""Chew before Swallowing."" There are no new smoking guns here. Instead, Moore gives us the case against George W. Bush, a fat compendium of previously reported crimes, errors, sins, and grievances delivered in the director's patented tone of vaudevillian social outrage. And it works for much of the film; indeed, the first two-thirds of ""Fahrenheit"" are chunky with damning information and imagery.

Moore ice-skates quickly but vividly over the 2000 Florida vote debacle and the placement of Bush relations, appointees, and sympathizers in crucial posts, from Fox News to the Supreme Court. He distills much of the information in such books as Craig Unger's ""House of Bush, House of Saud"" and Richard A. Clarke's ""Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror"" and presents it to the non-reading public with bitter wit and an eye for the telling visual.

It's one thing, for instance, to read about the administration's attempts to hush up the Bush family's longstanding ties to the rulers of Saudi Arabia and quite another to see two versions of George W. Bush's military records, the uncensored one providing the name of the fellow reservist and Texas money manager who allegedly funneled bin Laden family funds into Bush's businesses and political campaigns.

Moore also pauses to ridicule, and ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is rich with the mockery of powerful people shooting themselves in the foot. The media and celebrities come in for lumps -- there's a drive-by sound bite from Britney Spears that will destroy any remaining sympathy you might have for the singer -- but Bush and his pals are Moore's prime targets, from John Ashcroft unctuously crooning the self-penned ""Let the Eagle Soar"" to Paul Wolfowitz spitting on his comb before running it through his hair prior to an interview.

As amusing as this is, it's awfully easy stuff. With the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Moore has to get down to business, and he knows it. He conveys the tragedy itself with remarkable (for him) understatement, leaving the screen black and letting the soundtrack pull us back. He caustically details the administration's manipulation of public fear and spends necessary time on the Orwellian implications of the Patriot Act. (Since no one on Capitol Hill seems to have actually read the act, Moore hires an ice cream truck to drive around Washington while he reads the bill over the loudspeaker.)

There comes a point in any Michael Moore movie, though, where the filmmaker crosses the line from populism into shamelessness. In ""Bowling for Columbine,"" it was when he left the photo of a shooting victim on then NRA president Charlton Heston's doorstep. In ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" that moment comes when Moore goes back to his hometown of Flint, Mich., and focuses on Lila Lipscomb, a lower-middle-class mother of a US soldier in Iraq.

Already the movie's treatment of the war has blown hot and cold. Moore gets the comedy of Army recruiters trolling shopping mall parking lots for fresh meat, and the tragedy of the Bush administration's proposed cuts in military pay and benefits. Footage of atrocities and abuses similar to those at Abu Ghraib prison are here and terrible to see. At the same time, one tiny sentence about Saddam Hussein's crimes against his own people might have gone a long way to silence Moore's critics.

With the death of Lipscomb's son in Iraq, Moore himself turns exploiter. Her grief, of course, is genuine. So is our response to it. But when Moore prompts her to read her son's final letter out loud, and she cries helplessly as she does so, it becomes clear that the filmmaker's intrusiveness knows no bounds, and that he would sacrifice the dignity of even his beloved Flintians for political theater.

For all that, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" remains the summer's must-see. Not because Disney tried to censor it; please, the film studio told its Miramax subsidiary it wouldn't distribute the film well over a year ago, and the recent mini-scandal is both pure PR and exactly what Moore and the Weinstein brothers should have done to get the movie to as many people as possible.

No, ""Fahrenheit"" should be seen because it takes off the gloves and wades into the fray, because it synthesizes the anti-Bush argument like no other work before it, and because it forces you to decide for yourself exactly where passion starts to warp point of view.

One last thought: ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is many things, but for pity's sake let's not call it a documentary. To do so abuses the word and shames the good and balanced work done by filmmakers as storied as D.A. Pennebaker and Barbara Kopple, as current as Jehane Noujaim of ""Control Room,"" and as hard-working and unheralded as Carma Hinton of Brookline's Long Bow Group.

Moore, by contrast, is a maker of agit-entertainment, of cinematic essays whose express purpose is to convince. That's fine as long as he's respecting his audience. But when he pushes the camera into Lipscomb's weeping face and keeps it there, he's saying that he doesn't trust you to think for yourself. And that is when he becomes his enemy.

advanced happy bithrday to bots!
thanks for dinner guys!

met up with some old high school friends in NSG last night. i have to say ... we've grown up a bit, haven't we? let's see: (1) we drive cars (2) we go on dates (3) we have no curfew. life is good. god is good. so let's all drink and be happy!

i have been blessed with the gift of gab. yes. i'll talk and talk and talk until your ears give up on you. it's weird having to write down all my thoughts instead of just spilling it out on one major chica fest!

prim and proper
party princesses

okay focus. strebel said i had a hard time finding my focus. so here's my best attempt at it.

i love my friends. i love seeing my friends. i love the hugs you get after you haven't seen them in a while. i love the chitter-chatter of excited gossip! i would have preferred to sit down with old friends over a cup of coffee instead of having to sit in a ""bar"" with a dlsu/tapat-sponsored concert. it was too damn loud! i was screaming at the top of my voice trying to update my friends with what happened with so-and-so. i think i went deaf last night.

next stop: chaquicos for bjorn's 21st birthday. i didn't realize it was his ""debut"" - i've never been to a man-debut before. well ... what can i say? kudos to bjorn's mom who spared no expense for her son. she had the place closed for the night, open bar and 500 beers! i love it! she even surprised him with a video presentation. i swear to god i got goosebumps. i wish *ahem* someone would do that for me. reality check!

thank god for valet! and who do i see making yosi at the door?! ta-dah!

he's baaaccccccccck! jorge! pj! piaget! haha! the boy still has his moves!!!

realization #1 boys go to the bathroom in a pack. i wonder why they wonder why girls go to the bathroom in groups. heck. the do it too.

realization #2 have free beer, a pack of yosi and we'll parteeee!!!

realization #3 sober boys will never dance. it'll take probably 6 bottles of strong ice and another 6 shots of tequila before you can pull these boys to the dancefloor.

realization #4 some boys will remain faithful to their girlfriends even when they've had too much to drink. that's my boy kev! you make me proud!

realization #5 if you get work at it really hard and play the friendship card well, you'll get miguel drunk. haha. but the boy has principles, dammit.

peachy, cathy, nicole, and i danced the night away! didn't care if the dj kept on playing the same song over and over and over again. hey, it's all good."

"event","what a way to kick of my sembreak! can't get any better than kicking back, pigging out, and having a nice little movie marathon that lasts from sun-up to sun-down! of course it would have been better if i had someone to cuddle with but what the hell. i've been looking forward to this since the start of the sem! hahaha! finally, i've got all of my favorite movies on DVD!!!

of course i had to psych myself out first ... although thinking back, i'm wondering why i popped those discs in the player, knowing that HBO plays them all the time. hohum! i had to watch the first two harry potter movies first. and then finally ... for the unveiling ...

<img src=""http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/MG/199169.jpg"">

i loved it! of course the books are always better but it's also nice to see them actually come to life. i was looking forward to this movie the whole summer and finally i got to see it. my my my, how fast kids grow up these days! draco malfoy has acne. harmione granger has a nice looking booty. and harry potter is looking hot hot HOT. no comment for ron weasly. i thought the movie was great! in a dark and cynical way. nice to see some changes in the cinematography. i think they even changed directors for this one. shoot. now i have to reread all five books. they're all mixed up in my head. as a result, i am yet again on a harry potter fever. damn, i think i swore never to read harry potter --- who's the culprit? who am i to blame now?

as if that's not enough, i got my daily dose of brad pitt! woohoo! get a load of

<img src=""http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/MG/202825.jpg"">

""IMMORTALITY! Take it! It's yours!"" when did brad pitt's body get chistled out like that. i've always been a brad pitt fan. always always. i swear to god, i was like ""whoa!"" and then i was like ""wow!"" dammit. i think i'd have to refresh my memory on the my greek mythology though. sheeet. i sounded so stupid trying to sound intelligent and learned about it. hohum.

phew! how ruggedly handsome brad pitt is! and that ass! talk about booty! ged i wish i could be mrs. brad pitt for even just a second. how sweet it is!

i never thought i could picture orlando bloom outside is LOTR role. but wow. such a transformation. one minute he's legolas, the next he's paris of troy. transition to LOTR. aha! movie marathon next week, friday! just wait and see. i can't wait to get my hands on that 6-disc set! hahaha!"

"event","so what's a girl to do when your very recent ex (who, by the way, has not digested the fact that you broke up with him) asks you out because apparently it's your ""third year anniversary""? why, you say yes of course! revenge, honey, is a dish best served cold.

tell me one thing, why would you go through all the stops when i've already broken up with you? an example, if you may ...

pota. may nalalaman pang flowers and stuff toy. pink pa. pink na biik! ano ako? piglet?! nampota.

okay. history. are you ready? mahaba toh.

friendster/emily bais. damn. epitome ng pokpok. yah, strut your stuff honey, that's all you can do. talk about a bitch. so she goes around trying to give people the impressing that she and dyowi (pronounced as JOEY) are togther. what a suck-up. this is exactly what you do to piss me off.

go and suck up big time to my boyfriend's family. yah. woo them in and make them love you enough for them to be able to say ""kailangan mo ng back up? ako back up mo! buong pamilya ko back-up mo!"" yah. i took all that shit just for the stupid reason called loved. i guess you really couldn't blame me, i was holding on to what would have been three years. so it went on ... for MONTHS. it went on for 6 months to be exact. bangayan, bungguan. pota. how stupid of me. i should have never given her the time of day, not to mention the heartache and the tears. oh fuck. that's life for you. another bitch.

it all went down one night when she called me up at 3 in the morning. i had been up all night studying for my expe psy long test, jossed up and lungs full of nicotine, i didn't need to hear her little ditzy voice at the other end of the line. taena, i think i really work best in the wee hours of the morning. i totally creamed that bitch's ass the moment i picked up the phone. big mistake. i gave her what she deserved, dumb bitch. she couldn't even get a fucking word it. tadah! i outclass you without even trying, sweetie. and no, spelling it as it is (C-L-A-S-S) doesn't mean you've got it. sorry.

move on. no more of that emiy bitch. although she is on friendster and myspace. check her out. stupid shit.

some peace and quiet finally. although i will never forget. jesus, why would the woman get hung up on you if you didn't drop hints? i'm watching my back ...

that's exactly what i did. i watched my back. i was out to find evidence and evidence i found! haha! too bad, dyowi, you had it coming for a long time. you were practically asking for it. so now, don't come crawling back. who wants who more now?

men, don't leave your dirty laundry out in the open for everyone to see. women are truly more superior and more intelligent than you. if you're going to cheat, make sure we don't catch you. don't take photographs of you and the tramp (major emphasis on TRAMP, POKPOK, WHORE, BAYARAN!, NAMPOTA) and especially don't send your best friend copies over the mail. i am smart and don't even think twice about that. i know your every move. i know all about it. the secret accounts. the secret stash. taena, if you're going to cheat on me, don't insult me even further by fucking someone that looks like THAT. pota. okay lang kung kagandahan eh. kaso hindi. sorry dyowi, kupal ka - in every sense of the word.

that's what you get for messing with me.

i've been waiting all day here for you babe 
so won't you come sit and talk to me 
and tell me how we're gonna be together always 
i hope you know that when it's late at night 
i hold on to my pillow tight 
and think of how you promised me forever 
(i never thought that anyone) could make me feel this way 
(now that you're here boy all I want) is just a chance to say 

get out (leave) right now 
it's the end of you and me 
it's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone 
cause I know, about her (move) 
and I wonder (why) 
how I bought all the lies 
you said that you would treat me right 
but you was just a waste of time (waste of time) 

tell me why you're looking so confused 
when i'm the one who didn't know the truth 
how could you ever be so cold? 
to go behind my back and call my friend 
boy you must've gone and bumped your head 
because you left her number on your phone 
(so now after all is said and done) 
maybe i'm the one to blame but 
(to think that you could be the one) 
well it didn't work out that way 

i wanted you right here with me 
but i have no choice, you've gotta leave 
because my heart is breaking 
with every word I'm saying, 
boy i gave up everything I had 
on something that just wouldn't last 
but i refuse to cry 
no tears will fall from these eyes (ohh, ohh) 

get out! 

get out (leave) right now 
it's the end of you and me (you and me) 
it's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone) 
cause I know, about her (move) 
and i wonder (why) 
how i bought all the lies (how did buy all your lies?) 
you said that you would treat me right (you said that you) 
but you was just a waste of time (waste of time) 

leave!"

Falling on the rooftop
Ooh baby tell me why'd you have to go
Cause this pain I feel
It won't go away
And today I'm officially missing you
I thought that from this heartache
I could escape
But I fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today
I'm officially missing you

Ooh can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey baby say it stays on my mind
And I, I'm officially

All I do is lay around
Two ears full tears
From looking at your face on the wall
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I don't even know you at all
I don't know you at all
Well I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess it's safe to say baby safe to say
That I'm officially missing you

Well I thought I could just get over you baby
But I see that's something I just can't do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just can't find a way
To let go of you"

first things first. dacanay. need i say more? so you pray to god really hard just so you wouldn't have to explain the morality of principles. what do you know? i think god and dacanay really do work hand in hand. ""will you look at thesis number nine and explain?"" sheeet. that was the longest 30 minutes of my life. not a good way to start the day. dj and i were there before the sun even came up. and what do you know?

SARAH: guard, andyan na ba si father?
GUARD: opo ma'am.

pota. it's 5 am! you'd think the old man would go home right? helllll no. nope. he was there even before we got there.

note to dj: we did it! after countless hours on the phone and in starbucks. after getting screamed at by some guy with a newspaper in his hand. after not sleeping. after sharing the fever and the sore throat (and not to mention the sore eyes) we did it! hahaha! the only think i got out of the dacanay orals is that i feel as if i can do anything now!

second things second. strebel. i hate philo. who doesn't? everyone i've met with so far hates it. i don't know why we even have to take philo. this negativity towards the question ""what is philosophy?"" has been so obvious from the very beginning. so i've been failing this entire semester and it looks as if my philo grade is going to pull my entire qpi down. daaamn. and i thought the glitz and glamour of DL was within reach. to add insult to injury, sheeet. i think i just got an f for 15% of my grade.

third things third. team squidward. good job guys. special individual mentions for dennis, ange, marie, and cha. it's been a roller coaster ride this sem. pwet. we did it! haha! minus the minor (major) set-back early on, i think we pretty much nailed it. i really don't care what we got for our final paper (okay, so that's not entirely true!) but i'm glad the whole process is over! not that it hasn't been fun! here's a flashback ...

is it just me? do i have a neon sign flashing on my forehead? it's like i attract the worst kind of men. just my fucking luck. my fault on this one. my fault entirely. i let myself be vulnerable, and people just take advantage of it. geeez, you'd think god would smile down on me and give me a break after all the heartache i've been trough this past year but noooo. just another bump in the road. dammit.

just when i thought life was starting to good. just when i was starting to trust again. god decided, not yet. but i wanted this one. i still do.

life lesson #1
you are born into this world an innocent.
guilt-free.
sugar-free.
caffeine-free.
you are noble and pure.
then suddenly ...
WHACK.
you are spanked.
really hard.
this is unfair.
you have done nothing wrong.
you know this for a fact.
pain exists.
life can hurt.
like a lot.
even when you're good, you can get whacked.
without apology.
without explanation. 

and don't forget it. they lead you on and play their games and then just drop you when they lose interest. men, we are not your playthings dammit.

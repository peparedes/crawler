"event","<p>I've totally had nothing to update about for ages. 
I really wish the football would pick up again soon. The Boro boys are back in training and we've made two new signings: Didier Digard I calls him Didi and Marvin Emnes. And Captain fantastic George Boateng has left us to go to Hull. I'm gonna miss his bling bling teeth and singing his song at matches. Bye Bye Georgie.

And finally I'm off on holiday tomorrow, i'm not going anywhere interesting just the Lake District (I expect it will rain all week). The worst part is i might not be able to have internet connection. *cires*
I also get my Uni results i'm not to nervous about them, i know i've already passed at least half the year. The only problem is that there published online (when i'm on holiday! *sigh* i'll figure out a way to get them somehow)

<lj-cut text=""Okay i've seen this Bag meme about so i thought i'd join in......."">
The handbag one - 
<i>One: Take a picture of your bag.
Two: Now dump everything out, neatly adjust them, and take a picture (no matter how embarrassing).
Three: Talk about the items inside. Details, plz.</i></p><p><em></em>I have many many bags but i usually use this one and another one the most but this is my favorite. I got it on sale in Accessorize for half price (it was two pretty to resist ) its abit old now though so i'm looking out for my new favorite bag :D

<strong>1.</strong> My lovely ipod, which i call nando :D I love music so this is always something i carry with me.
<strong>2.</strong> One of the current books I'm reading. It's three books in one called The Bromeliad by Terry Practhet.
<strong>3.</strong> Lollipops!! These are my favorites, their called traffic lights and you can get them in Red, Blue and Green and they make the whole of your mouth go the same colour i usually buy them at a newsagents thats on the way to the Boro matches and me and Oneoseven have them at half time.
<strong>4.</strong> A hair band. i love hairbands during the summer.
<strong>5.</strong> My flash pen drive clip thing! (i never know what there supposed to be called)
<strong>6.</strong> Lipgloss of love.
<strong>7.</strong> For days when i'm not feeling lipgloss pretty my trusty lipsalve.
<strong>8.</strong> My Lg Viewty phone of love, pretty much the only other thing that goes with me everywhere.
<strong>9.</strong> Receipts!!!!! I always forget to empty my bag of them. There was only one this time which is quite a surprise!
<strong>10.</strong> Orbit Chewing gum for minty fresh breath! My favorite brand.
<strong>11.</strong> My purse. Contains: my bus ticket with bad photo id, my debit card, my studend id, my old season ticket card, some moneys, some store cards, my Starbucks card with about enough credit left on it for two mocha frappachinos (my summery drink of choice)
<strong>12.</strong> Some shiny pretty earings i bought at Accessorize for half price that i forgot to take out of my bag.
<strong>13.</strong> A little tin of mints with a handy little compact mirror. 
<strong>14.</strong> SD card for my camera. I usually loan it to  &lt;lj user=""oneoseven""&gt; cause this ones got a bigger memory which is why it isnt in my camera.
<strong>15.</strong> Some loose change. A 20p and a 10p 
<strong>16.</strong> My boro pen.  Always a good idea to carry round a pen you'll never know when you need one.

"event","THEY WON!!!!! <br />It did give me a small pang in my heart though because when everyone was celebrating, i just couldnt help but feel sad because if England continue the way they have then I may never get to see my country win a major tournement and feel the Euphoria of it. <br /><br />But it is fantastically great that spain won and i can't think of a team that deserve it more other than England, possibly... maybe.... because like the Spanish we have gone over forty years without a major trophy, despite all the quarter, semis and finals that we've played in, but on the other hand i feel England is too arrogant and what we should learn from this is that it can be possible but I think the country as a whole needs to lower their expectations and just try to play good football and see where that takes us. <br /><br />This video is made of some much win!:&nbsp;<br /><font size=""4""><strong><font color=""#ff0000"">Spian</font> <font color=""#ffcc00"">Conga celebration</font> <font color=""#ff0000"">love</font></strong></font>&nbsp;<br /><font size=""1"">(sorry it's embeded on the&nbsp;BBC website so click on the piccie for video of uber awesome funess)</font><br /><a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7480565.stm""><img height=""181"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/glisteningsoul/pic/0003p2s6/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />Also i thought it&nbsp;lovely that Sergio Ramos payed tribute to Antonia Puerta at the end of the final with his top like he did after Real Madrid.<br /><br />&nbsp;"

Its the final and i'm dead nevous cause spain don't have Villa and even though i have faith that the rest of the team can do it, Villa still gives them and edge.

And Ballacks in the squad so their fielding their strongest side and it'd be just like the Germans to play average through the tournement but win the final hands down or on PENALTY'S!!!!

Please dont let it go to pens!

Awwwwww their playing 'Walk on' in the stadium, waaaaaay cool."

Cue me blurting out very quickle ""Hi! look i'm really sorry but doctor whos on it' the near the end, big dramatic moment! what is it?""
By this point he looked abit dazed and confused at my extra long sentance that I said really fast.
he goes ""oh erm Vicky yes?""
I go ""yes""
He goes ""I'm here about the broken window""
I go ""What broken window?"" looking around as if some broken window is going to appear right in front of me. (and again i spoke with the quick and was half watching the tv screen while i'm speaking )
he goes ""You reported a broken window yesterday (at sometime or other)""
I say ""er no""
he goes ""this is Kent Close right?""
I laugh and say ""nope you got the wrong street"" and point and tell him where he needs to go to get to Kent again with the quickness bless him he was fairly young and looked kinda confused.
Then i say ""ok erm, really wanna see Doctor who so yeah, bye, ok bye"" and close the door quickly and dash back to my telly screen of love with teh Doctor for end which made me say 'What!?' ala doctor who style quite abit

I hate hate hate TO BE CONTINUED!

Bless the poor police person i bet the last thing he expected to have to deal with is trying to hold a conversation with who is high and disracted by the doctor who fangirl equivalent of crack!

Also Russel T Davies please make sure tennant Doctor can come back plskthnks ah needs mah tennant! I can deal with a year out for Hamlet goodiness but not for longer."

"event","Ok lost of stuff has gone on in the past few days. 

<strong>Number 1:</strong> Had my birthday dinner thing at Joe Riggatonis a lovely Italian restaurant that I heart. <lj-cut text=""Me my mam, Reanne(Oneoseven) and Reannes Mam went..."">Me my mam, Reanne <lj user=""oneoseven""> and Reannes mam went and i learned that i love Cosmopolitans and i got surprised by a sparkley birthday icecream by the restaurant which i totally didn't expect. We also wne to the cinema where we saw The Happening which while not a terrrible film isn't worth wasting money on. </lj-cut>

<strong>Number 2:</strong> <lj-cut text=""Turkey going out. woe :( ""> Turkey going out woe :( They played well despite having every setback you could possibley imagine. It was an achievment for them to get to the semis and i'm all yay but its all sad obviously. 
-on a side note whatever Podolski was doing when the rest of the German squad was sat down at the end and he was shouting to the crowd and they were shouting back was canny, (and i'm not a germany fan/fangirl in ANY way) </lj-cut>

<strong>Number 3:</strong> Spain V Russia ForTehWeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen! But i had a serious oh no and didn't get to watch it till the day after, <lj-cut text=""the reson for this was... ""> The match clashed with my birthday dinner, serious arrrgh! so i taped it BUT IT DIDN'T TAPE!!!!! all i got was a blue screen! So i had to wait to watch a repeat on eurosport. I knew the score but i had to avoid everything for ages so i didnt get spoilers, which means i couldnt go on lj :( 
Anyway it was seriously awesome and i hope they beat the Germans. </lj-cut>

<strong>Number 4:</strong> Glastonbury. It's back and i have red button love so i can catch it all and i lufs it. Can't wait to see Cystal Castles, Massive Attack and Jay Z.

<strong>Number 5:</strong> Trying to get into Tennis abit. So far i like Janko Tipsarevic and obviously Rafael Nadal who i already new alittle about before i started watching it properly. Anyway they are both seriously canny and my verdict is Tennis is amusing but it's got nothing on football."

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px""><strong>1.</strong> The Birthday has been and went for those of you who didn't know :D 
It was an awesome day mostly because : 
<strong>a)</strong> Doctor Who owned me. Srsly anyone who hasn't yet watched episode 4.11 <u><strong>NEEDS</strong></u> to see it! I cannot wait for next week. 
<strong>b)</strong> More Euro 2008 love allthough i was sad to see Holland go out but Russia did play much better so it was deserved. 
<strong>c)</strong> <lj-cut text=""SHIRT LOVE"">
<strong><img alt="""" src=""http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g104/Glistening_soul/smaller.jpg"" /> 
</strong>It was a major decision between Tuncay and Wheater but i decided on Wheater cause <lj user=""oneoseven"">is getting Tuncay BUT if i like the away shirt i will probably get Tuncay on it. 

Anyway I had to get Wheater on my shirt at some point cause to me he's absolutley fantastic and i am in total marvel of him because: 
*He comes from the same town as me: Redcar 
*He's the same age as me (and if he hadn't gone to the Catholic school we'd have probably gone to the same school) 
*He's very good 
*We sold Jonathan Woodgate cause he's that good 
*Fabio Capello seems to think he's good because he got into the England Squad (granted only onto the bench 
but......) 
*he's done all this and he's still only just played one season of premier league football! 
still early days of course but under the tuteledge of Southgate and with Capello's endorsement and pretty much a guarantee of more full seasons of Premier league football where he can learn and progress against the best players in the world the futures looking very good. </lj-cut>

<strong>2.</strong> <strong>SPAIN V ITALY</strong> <lj user=""oneoseven"">(Reanne) came round to watch it and whilst i like both teams alot I like Spain more. 

<lj-cut text=""So there we were, me in my Spain shirt..."">So there we were, me in my Spain shirt and her wearing her England goalkeeper shirt which is the same colour as the Italy shirt (cause she has to wait for much needed funds before she can get her cannavaro shirt, although i told her she should have just worn the Italy Gatusso shirt she got me for my birthday - which i havent got yet cause we're waiting till tomorrow so her mam can watch me open my presents :D) 

Anyway it occurred to us as we sat down to watch that it might not be a good thing to watch the football together when we're on opposing sides. So we were really hoping that the match would be decided before penalty's cause it would be easier to deal with. 
Of course that didnt happen and Italy went out. 
It was horrible because i was soooooooo happy that Spain had got through because this is huge for them but on the other hand Reanne was seriously sad which made me sad too! 

<strong>Things I have learnt are:</strong> we need to not be on opposites sides for major football things again or at least maybe not watch together. 

But anyway i am happy happy happy BUT I really don't want to see a Spain V Turkey Final cause that would kill me, but i really don't want germany to be in the final! Basically whatever happens i am going to be woe in some way. </lj-cut>

So now I am definatly rethinking this liking England not in the Euros thing. It's not freeing anymore I've become attached to too many teams! !!!!
I want England BACK!!!! It makes things soooo uncomplicated. 
When England are here i can support them get to the quarters or the semis see us go out in penalty's and then just relax and watch happily while other people are getting stressed and feeling woe.</p>"

"event","<p>Croatia V Turkey has just kicked off and i'm getting smaller but similar feelings of nervousness and excitement that i get for boro for Turkey. I think i might have said it before but the do kinda remind me of Boro plus they've taken to wearing Red with a white band just like Boro do.<br /><br />I like and respect Croatia alot and my head tells me they will win but my heart really wants Turkey to win and then beat the Germans!</p><p>EDIT: Oh God it's seriously killing me, for all of the second half i've just been bracing for the impact of Croatia scoring, Turkey just don't look like they are gonna score at all&nbsp;AND Tuncay will miss the semi final if they ever get there, cause he picked up another yelow</p><p>Its now in extra time and tbh Turkey haven't been great and i really don't know what to think anymore Gah!</p>EDIT EDIT: On word Phenomenal! I cannot believe it First that absolute last minute goal and then the penalty's Turkey seriously own me but now I have to go through the stress on them playing Germany with quite a few players missing!<br /><br />And on i side note I hate it when footbllers cry (other than ronaldo which is just funny) It was kinda heartbreaking seeing some of the croatian players breaking down in tears. They're a team that i truly respect and enjoy watching and I don't care that they beat England because we were very bad and they were good simple as that. They&nbsp;pull together as a team and there arn't really big names and there humble and believe in themselves in essence everything engalnd arn't and probably should try to be."

"event","So the other day i was watching World Cup Outtakes on tv before one of the matches and i caught this part. <br />Sadly i fail and didn't get it from the beginning but the gist is (and some of you may or may not know this) that in Euro 96 the England squad to amuse themselves set the challenge to each other to slip as many song titles as they can into the interviews they did. Lol love the England team of any generation <br />Mainly i recorded it cause it has a much younger Gareth Southgate in it at the beginning and he is Boro manager extraordinaire so i had to put it up. Plus it has Alan Shearer being funny! which is a marvel in itself! 
Anyway it's kinda lame but it amused me :D<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""1""/><br /><lj-cut text=""And here&#39;s the reply to the same meme i posted the other day but this time for busem"">
<strong>Supernatural:</strong> I heart this show for its Brothers of yummyness and its plotlines of win and lets not forget Papa Winchester and the third most important character in the show Metallicar! But seriously I love the show and all of these types of shows and i'm so glad its finally back on after the stupid writers strike and plus i love all the heavy metal/rock music on it too. <br /><br /><strong>Football:</strong> I must confess that a few years back i had absolutely no interest in the game but i think i'm more than making up for it because i'm absolutely obsessed by in now. It started when <lj user=""oneoseven"">&nbsp;kept going on at me about it and for ages i didn't really pay attention but when i got a job at the boro and i watched the matches it just got me hooked now i couldn't imagine not having football in my life to obsess over and i'm going to cry when i won't have all my lovely student loans anymore and probably won't be able to afford a season ticket because theres nothing it the world better than being at the riverside watching my team play and more often than not loosing. :D <br /><br /><strong>System Of A Down:</strong> Got into the when they released mezmerize, (which was quite late on) BYOB just kept getting played on the radio and i got hooked mezmerize is still one of my favorite albums to date but i love all their albums and i've very sad that there on hiatus and might never reform. My favorite song of their's is Aerials/Chop Suey (i cant choose between them) <br /><br /><strong>Pirates of the carribean:</strong> Fantastic films of swashbuckling fun. Johnny Depp is God for creating Captain Jack. I'm still gonna watch this films when i'm 70! There just brilliant and i'm so glad they made three. <br /><br /><strong>Cheese:</strong> My Favorite food in the whole wide world, so many varieties flavours and textures. If i wasn't allowed to eat anything else in the world ever again but cheese i don't think i could complain. My favorite ever is Wensleydale cheese (and i love going to the factory in Hawes- which is in the North Yorkshire moors which im my opinion is one of the best places in england- because there's free samples (lots of free samples :D) <br /><br /><strong>Angel:</strong> The Buffy spin off show which along with buffy i loved dearly and miss loads. I love how it made me laugh, cry and feel everything in between. Though it did loose the plot abit towards the end, which i don't think would have been the case if it hadn't been canceled slightly prematurely, it just felt rushed and uncomplete towards the end. <br /><br /><strong>Photoshop:</strong> Where would i be without photoshop helping me to make all my pretty headers and icons. When i first got it i didnt have a clue how to use it it just sounded good but i kept trying and now i feel i'm decent at i it in a very amature way. I'm a fairly artistic person but i choose not to continue with it after school and i could have lost my artistic outlet but having photoshop means i can still be arty, which is great. :D&nbsp;<br />"

"event","&nbsp;Today i was sat on the bus in front of a man that was coughing so much i was beginning to have the suspiscion that he may have SAR's or at least some bad germs that i feel will inevitably be passed on to me, most probably leading to my either dying from&nbsp;it or at the least getting a really bad cold just in time for the Chelsea match, because you know that would be just my luck.<br />Furthermore infront of me was a gentleman swilling some sort of alcoholic beveage from a hip flask. Oh the joys of public transport and the selection of society that you find on it.<br /><br />At the moment i am reading 'The intimate adventures of a London&nbsp;call girl' by Belle de jour. Sadly i'm a bit of a bandwagonista with this book because i only decided to pick up the book after seing the first episode of the televison adaption of it, but never the less it has been rather enjoyable. Lately many books are wrote in a bloggish kid of style, which for me is perfect as rather than being in chapters everything is wrote in small entries so these are god pick up put down books.<br />However to the point i read in it that as you get old your pubic hair goes grey and if you get even older it can&nbsp;begin falling out!!!!!&nbsp;<br />GETTING OLD is a scary thought.<br />I also had a thought earlier on today that i think that when i'm older (but still not grey old) i might find my hair getting thing on the top of my head.<br />There are actually realistic facts to indicate what would seem like my inevitable balding on the top of my head.<br /><strong>#1</strong>&nbsp; I have a thyroid problem (as in it barely works) meaning&nbsp;my body&nbsp;dos'nt produce enough thyroxin. A byproduct of this is loss of hair. Now when i was around 15/16 and still undiagnosed my hair did start coming out, at the time i didnt think much of it, as a child i had really thick hair and just thought because i was getting older it was just thinning out abit.<br /><strong>#2</strong> My mam is thin on top (mum has the thyroid thing to)&nbsp;and i believe my Father was/is.<br />So really it doesnt look good especially since i dye my hair too.<br />I believe its time to start developing a fetish for hats.<br /><br />In other news England lost and we quite possibly probably might not qualify and an interesting thing in a Britsh newspaper said the Jose Mourinho said he might take over if SMac looses his job because we didnt qualify. Although i'm doubtful on the truth of this report as it comes from a tabloid, i would still LOVE for it to happen because Jose Mourinho is the most awesome maneger ever - mainly cause of what comes out of his mouth everytime he does and interview- so if there is a football God and you fancy doing us a favour get rid of the 'magnificent' git if favour of Jose we'd be much obliged."

And me and _millet_ have been to a few reserve matches.<br /><br />Yesterday we watched the first three episodes of heroes which were completly awesome. I'm not gonna go into cause there be spoilers but suffice to say i'm loving all the new stuff and the new characters, and all the pretties though i have to say what the hell is going on ith Nathans beard!?!<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm getting my hair done, I'm trying to ty to get back to my normal colour which is sort of a light brown/coppery colour and i'm also getting it cut though i'm still not entirely sure how.<br /><br />Anyway if its all pretty and i like it i'll post pictures :D&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh yeah and just to add i watched my first rugby match last weekend. Basically i've been wanting to broaden my sporting intetrest for a while and i tried cricket but i'm completly lost and i'd been hearing the build up to the England v France match so i was intrigued so i watched it and it was quite cool so me and millet are going to be watching the final next weekend.<br /><br />And of course were watching England v Russia tommorrow because two of our club boys might be in the squad because along with stewy, squishy (that is to say Luke Young, we call him squishy cause he has a squishy face and is adorable and youngy just doesnt sound right) have been called up."

I quite possibly might have lost all my friendlies but even though i havent been around i still think of you guys.

Anyway i've just been doing lots of stuff this summer such as cleaning out my living room and getting rid of alot the junk me and my mam have managed to hoard over the years and we've changed the layout of the living room abit. I've also re-decorated the bathroom and i think its much better now.
But really all this home improvement stuff is reall stupid because there going to be nocking down alot of the houses i my street including mine and re-housing us somewhere else, cause they want to remodel the area or something.

Anyway i'm sure i did alot more stuff this summer i just cant recall it all rght now. Anyway now i'm getting back into a regular routine so hopefully it will mirror on eljay.

Today was fun cause i got my student loan in, which meant muchos dinero to spend on pretty winter clothes. I had myself a little shopping bonanza. Plus me and Reanne were very amused by&nbsp;trying on lots of different hats and scarfs. Anyway i got some things but i still have some more things to&nbsp;get. I want to get one or two new pars of shoes and ne or two new bags. I'm looking to get&nbsp;these itms in a metallic-y bronze colour and in teal.

Anyway i'm gong now cause i want to watch the new season of prison Break and then to watch thi new show called the Riches.
Nw hopefully i can start coming on here more regularly.&nbsp;"

"event","Today was the Tyne-Tees derby. Smoggies v Geordies always a great fixture. Hasnt quite got the notoriety of say Man U v Man City or Liverpool v Everton. But to us Teessiders its just as important. <br />Anyway the result was: <br /><br /><strong><font size=""5""><font color=""#ff0000"">Boro</font> 2 - 2 Newcastle</font></strong> <br /><br />It was fantastic one of the better derbys i've been too, real end to end stuff although (and not just saying so because its my team) I think if anyone should have taken the three points if anyone was going to have them. I dont know the stats but i think we had more possession and created more chances. <br /><br />There was alot of singing and Viduka got booed more times than i can count. I hafta say i only sang at the begining cause a greedy traitor he may be, but i couldnt sing things like ""you fat bastard' cause the first match i ever went to when we lost 4-0 to Villa they sang that and it was mean and nasty and he had done alot for the club. <br />There was an excellent song that was sung that went <br />""Have you ever seen the Geodies with a cup, <br />have you ever seen the geordies with a cup, <br />have you ever seen the Geordies, <br />ever seen the geordies, <br />ever seen the gerodies&nbsp;lift a cup, <br />Have you fuck!"" <br />(mam informs me its to the tune of 'she'll be coming round the mountain') <br />The best part was that there goal keeper Harper was laughing at it and Millet said that he was laughing cause it was true. :D <br /><br />Honestly i could write more of the songs they were just awesome but i shall refrain. <br />Anyway it was a great game and i even got Big Sams Autograph and I saw Bobby Robson which was awesome. <br /><br />Oh yeah and just a little side note, i found Fernando Torres' website which is REALLY good ad hes so sweet and theres even some really cool interviews, one of thens was Dani from El Canto de Loco interviewing Nando. Anyway for anyone that hasnt already seen it heres the link: <a href=""http://www.fernando9torres.com/"">Fernando Tores</a><br />&nbsp;<br />"

"event","England V Germany

a fixture that gets even the mildest english football fan excited, even when its just a friendly. And of course everyone keeps saying there are no friendlys against Germany, which is very true.
Anyway i cant wait and i think we have a good chance, our squads quite patchy becase of injuries but so is Germany's barely any of there big names are playing which is on the one hand sad cause i dont get to see Ballack, Frings, Poldolski and Sweinstieger(sp) palying but a God send for England.

Anyway its been 32 years since England beat Germany at Wembley, I hope tonight we can put an end to that. 

Also i hope to seee our stewy play too!

And in other news Yakubus been sold to Everton for just over 11 million which is a good price and while i'm a little sad to see the yak go, we've been waiting for a while for the deal to go through so its not too bad. He's had a good few years for us and its time for him to move on.

I've also change my layout for the first time to a boro theme."

I hope we can get a point! huh and the yaks just been replaced by Dong gook lee!!! :O
i hope he scores a a goal he needs to at least to prove one of our strikers can i mean we've got the Yak and that whole situations iffy and we've got Aliadeire and Tuncay and Lee and there all new and havent scored yet And now were supposed to be getting this Mido bloke i swear we're getting top heavy and our proper defence is all injured!
I swear if we dont at least score some goals soon my unfailing optomism for Boro might fail.

Woe!

In other news i got a Wii which is muchos funage!
But it should come with a warning saying beware can be addictive and cause ahing arms/shoulders and tennis elbow type injuries.
I have a very achey right arm/shoulder.
But i swear there brilliant fun, and the Harry Pottr game is FTW cause they made the whole of FRICKING hogwarts which is fantabulous!"

There are many perfectly good reason i can go into for why we lost, but honestly we just really suck at first match of the season in the premiership we've never won one yet.

It was great though it has to be said season tickets are love and <strong><em>Football = Greatest feeling in the world</em></strong>

Also me and  <lj user=""_millet_""> got our new shirts which are awesome, i will post pretty piccies soon, i could also post all the pics we took posing with the players but since Reannes already put em up i shall just post a link.  <a href=""http://users.livejournal.com/_millet_/139265.html"">Us shamelessly posing as an excuse to egt close to the players! :D

BTW Jeremie Aliadiere smells absolutely gorgeous and is really good looking. Oh and Tuncay is like super famous he got mobbed when he came out.

I'd heard a rumour that he would be in it, but it was never confirmed and no theres proff. Which is fantastically amazing!<br /><br />There was also a rumour about the casting for HBP that Naomi Watts, Joseph Fiennes and Stuart Towsend had signed up. Even thoughits said to be not true i would like it to be. They better cast a really good Narcissa, i'm not sure who Townsend would play but i definately think he would fit in as a wizard.<br /><br />Also when i was browsing around on the internet movie database i came across the new Sweeny Todd film thats coming out soon, i've heard about it before but i'm getting quite excited about it now.<br />Thequick low dow of it if youve never heard of it is its about a barber who kills people (who are generally not nice) and a baker who cooks the dead meat from the bodies in pies. Anyway thats the very basic story theres lots more frills. And its a musical.<br />But the whol;e thing that gets me very excited about it is that Sweeny Todd is played by Johnny Depp, the baker, Mrs Lovett is played by Helen Boham Carter and The Judge is played by Alan Rikman and of course they all sign and the icing on the cake is that its directed by Tim Burton. So it is going to be yet another one of those classic Burton and Depp films I cant wait!&nbsp;</p>"

It's a UK comedy/drama and its bucketfull of brilliance with a dash of fantastic.<br />I absolutly heart it.<br />Basically its about a family on a british council estate in Manchester but its so much lke where i live that you wouldnt know the difference and everything i've seen them get up to on the show i've seen happen in real life.<br />Anyway i'm going to shut up about that unless anyof you have seen it cause it's just pointless me mentioning it if you havent.<br /><br />Also I'm in love with Hinder<br />Linkin Park and the Acrtic monkeys albums are growing on me too.

Lame!

Anyways this week i'm been studying my bum off for a bit and i've now found a new project.

Thats right folks I've channeled my inner Grandma and taken up gardening!
I've been giving my back garden a bit of a makeover so it'll be all prettiful and flowery for el summer.

This is so like my to find something big to do when all of my attention should be focused on exams.

Also theres been Dr ness and Heroeness been going on too.

I felt that the last two episodes of the Dr Who felt like they werent as good as other episodes. There were still good of course but not as good. And thats about as much as i can sa without getting all spoilery.

And then there was heroes which is just bucketfulls of awesomeness!!!!!
Anyway I was going to get all the episodes and me and Reanne were going to wait till the series inished and have a mini marathon of the last five back to back once i'd got them all.
Only that plan went totally out of the window once i said i hade got episode 19. So basically after uni we went back to my house and watch it and all i can say is I AM DEAD!!!! seriously it feels like the mother of all clff hangers (in reality it isnt i can think of past cliffys on other shows that top it, but for dramatic effect and all)&nbsp;anyways now we just wanna know what happens next so we're now waiting in dier anticipaton.

But man I gotta say after teh Buffmeister&nbsp;HEROES is the best Show in existance! *nods emphatically*

Anyways i'm off to go do more of my garden then watch teh doctor and maybe i'll be back later to fangirl.

Oh yeah and i'm also a happy chappy cause i just found out that DAVID TENNANT is doing and interview on Parky tonight :D

Also another oh yeah: C'mon Boro i hope my boys win today so will can clear any stupidly slim chance of relegaton."

"event","So today Reanne rang me up and we were chatting she had just been shopping and had bought lotsa pretty things, so anyway she wanted me to see the new pretties and so did i, so she was gonna bring them round mine but then i fancied a walk so i went round to her house and she really has got some lovely things, like this fantastic dress and and many other gorgeous tops and two skirts!!!!

It makes me all proud to think that i've had a part to play in getting the girl who a year ago lived in jeans and football shirts and now she actuall wears skirts and dresses.
Although i'm rather proud of myself too cause i swore only a couple of years back that i would never ever wear a dress or skirt again in my life and today i wore both in one day. :D

Anyways after that Reannes neighbour Sean; a guy our age, asked reanne to come out and have a kick about with the ball at first we were rather reluctant cause our football skills are a world of woefulness. But after a while Reanne started playing and eventually got me to give the ball a kick or two. This is something i usually dont do cause while i can watch football for my country it's rather different story when i attempt to play. Genrally speaking if i can get the ball to go in the right direction its a cause for celebration. Its actually quite lamentable too cause when i was younger i wasnt quite so horrific but now, well lets just say Ronaldiniho would weep.

Anywho i was growing&nbsp;in cofidence and then we decided to play the wall game (which i cant remeber the name of- its the one with the were you kick the ball against the wall and then the next person does and the next only you've got to try and make it impossible for them to hit it when its their turn).
But the problem i was wearing little shoesies which are so not of the good to run&nbsp;and kick a ball in and niether were reannes so she chaged into her trainers and i borrowed&nbsp;another pair of her trainers and while i looked well stupid wearing then with a dress it was all of the good because i could kick the ball better.

So we played for a while and&nbsp;fun was had by all.

The reason why i wrote about this was&nbsp;because it was really quite fun, hagning out in the street messing around is something i havent&nbsp;done in donkeys years and while i wouldnt do it all the time cause that would be lame cause i'm nearly&nbsp;20, it was quiet cool. Plus i wouldnt mind playing around with a footy more often come summer.

I also bumped into and old friend who i used to hang out on the streets with (god i make myself sound like a street urchin but back in the day when i was younger and i didnt have internet&nbsp;me and my friends used to all hang around in our street and make our our fun) anyway we had a mini trip down memory lane.

So to sum it up today was good and tommorow i'm going shopping again,I gets to buy pretties -damn i feel like gollum- :D all the pretties, my pretiies, my precious.....

&nbsp;Oh and another thing, i hafta say credit to Man U that was and excellent scoreline. I really couldnt believe thay had scored 5 goals in the first half!"

"event","I probably wasnt gonna post anything today but then i was commenting on and entry and got reminded about the whole Roma thing with the Man U fans and yes i totally realise this is all old news and shit but hey this is my lj and i write whatever the hell i like.

So anyways..
the whole thing with the Roma police and the ultras and stuff had pretty much all all of us boro fans&nbsp;going ""I told you so"" because last year two of our fans got stabbed (there not dead) and there was quite abit of fighting and it was all started by them too, our guys were just in the pub with their families and stuff. Anyway it was on our local paper saying that if they had bothered to actually do something last time round then this shit would probably not have happened this time round.
It also remids me of the other times this season theres been fighting and other bad stuff going on in Europe (and when i say Europe i mean the continent part). There was that&nbsp;lille&nbsp;hoohahh with man U and then there was the whole thing with the Italian clubs.

Point is if it was an English club that was responsible for this crap they'd of probably being kicked out of the UEFA competitions this season because of course everyone knows that hooliganism is the 'English disease' it kinda pees me off because i havent really seen or heard of any hooligan activity in the premiership for a long time yet it seems to be a serious problem in the rest of Europe especially Italy.
They need to get their shit sorted out, seriously UEFA or FIFA or whatever, they need to start kicking arses and taking names with all these european clubs that allow the fans to behave like that I'm mean FFS a policeman was killed!
And they really need to act on things the first time round not when its happened the third or fourth time."

I liked Rose but i never took to her hugely cause shes.... well to put it bluntly, abit thick.<br />Martha is intelligent and she asks question, which i really love beause it means we can get to find out more about the Doctor and other things. I really cannot wait for the rest of the show I would gladly lose the next 12 weeks of my life just so i could see it back to back without having to wait each week.<br />I love the Jugadoon too.

"event","<p>Ok so I'm kinda depressed.<br />Not because of anything bad i just seem to have come across a day filled with a lack of happiness. I spent the early hours of this morning till about 7:30am doing a stupid assignment. I then had two hours kip and got back up again went into Uni and fished off the assignment and handed it in. Since then i just have not found a way to make myself happy or amused. And its really weird cause i shouldnt feel like this cause i now have two weeks off and no new assignment deadlines or ages.<br /><br />Anyway the less i talk about this the better cause it might just make everybody else all sad and woefull. Hopefully i'll be back to regular shiny happy...... er wait i'm hardly ever shiny happy more laid back sardonic and contently amused, well anyway i hope i get back to my usually self.</p>"

"event","hello feels like lately everytime i evnetually get round to doing a new post i'm saying sorry for not being around and then listing reasons as to why. lol

Anyway two reasons:

One i've been totally absorbed in books, specifically i bought the fith sixth and seven in the series the week before last, and well what can i say, there addictive.
I'm quite happy aswell cause i can get the next two books in about a weeks time. :D

The other reason was the whole FA CUP Man United thing.
I'm not a sore looser but after reading certain post and comments upon the matter, I was seriously pissed off and quite frankly I wanted to avoid the whole arguing over whose right thing and getting peed off with people that i like.

So the only thing i have to say about my boys on the matter is i think the important thing people miss in the face of all the contreversy is that considering Man U are at the top of the table and we are 11 places behind them in the middle of the table, it would stand to reason since they are apparantly the better team that they should have easily won. Instead we hold them off to a draw at our place and the only way that the game was won at old trafford was due to a controversial penalty.
Anyway shit happens but i'm pround of my boys for trying and proving that (dubious penalty descions&nbsp;aside) we can match the top teams.

On another note i cant wait for round three in two weeks time (or whatever) at the Old trafford again. I think it promises to be heated to say the least."

WOENESS!!!!!!! <br /><br />And I swear if it goes to a replay i will keel over and die. <br />I reckon if i didnt dye my hair I would probably find premamture greyness already from the stress! <br /><br />Oh yeah and it's a sell out 35,000. Dude this is so gonna be made of so much awesome! <br /><br />In other news i went shopping today (again-&nbsp;I'm a girl so sue me- actually dont even though by student standards I'm by no means bankrupt, but i rather like my money where it is, in my bank) anyway i bought a denim skirt in anticipation of summer. <br /><br />English people amuse me (yes i relise I'm English) it gets to 11 degrees and we get a little bit of sun and we start acting like its the Costa del Sol! Lmao! <br /><br />With the thought of summer and the buying of a skirt and trying on of other summery clothes, I'm now rather excited at the prospect of doing a full on shop for summer clothes FTW! <br />*daydreams of buying new summery shoes/sandles/flipflops&nbsp;and lots of other pretty summer accesories* <br /><br />I also bought the Supernatural Season 1 boxset! <br />Jensen and Jared *drool* :D <br /><br />I also had a lecture on Youth and Rock n Roll, which made me very woeful because you would think that it would be really interesting compared to the usually boring crap, <br />But nooooooooooooooooo! <br />Who'da thunk that you can actually make Led Zepplin, Black Sab, The Beatles, Chuck berry, David Bowie and the Arctic Monkeys boring. <br />Inside i cried tears of woe at the terribleness of it all. <br />What should have been a lesson that rivaled Jack Black school of rock awesoness, tunred out to be something that made calculus seem interesting! <br />So in the end i comforted myself by drawing Mettalicar and then reading 442. <br /><br />Also one last thing, I'm adding a new mood theme. Its a Supernatural animated one which just pwns BUT i swear loading it up is soul destroying! It's taking forever. I lufs eljay but couldnt they come up with a better program for uploading a new mood theme? this one wants to make me slit my wrists. :("

Sorry to my flist for being very neglectful. 

Okay i'm gonna be frank at first i wasnt around cause i was feeling alittle miffed about being unloved in the f-list sense and then i wasnt around cause i've had an uber busy past two weeks.&nbsp;On the Monday&nbsp;there was the fashion strikes charity event at Middlesbrough football club. Which was the best do i've been to in my life. The food was beyond yummy and being in the same room with Southgate, Woodgate, stewy and Cattermole and seeing the others do the fashion show was brilliant. 

On Tuesday there was a players signing so naturally me and Reanne had to go along. Yakubu, Xavier and Lee Dong Gook were there. Oh and BTW Lee has like flawless skin and is quite pretty. And he has an absolutly gorgeous smile. The there was football matches on aswell that week. We had the replay with Bristol City and then we had another match. 
Tis past week ive been doing yet another stupid assignment for uni, i'm actually geting quite sick of them especially when i have writers block and eding up working throughmost of the day and&nbsp;the night and having to go straight in to uni to had the thing in.&nbsp; 

Time management skills i certainly do not have. 

Ok i'm bored of witting this no and Primevals on which is way more interesting. They have Do Dos and there so cute! 

I'm hoping i get back into liking lj again but at the moment i seem to lack interest in it. 

Oh and i also have to add poor Timmy it seems like hes only just got back and now he's out for the rest of the season."

"event","Okay the herts thing was pretty but now i wish it would go away cause tis not day of the valentine anymore.

Anyway i've just completed yet another stupidly big asssignemnet for uni. I basically work non stop for 7 hours from 12pm on thursday came hoke and my brain was dead but i still had the other half to do so eventually i recovered some degree of santity and then set out to do the rest at around midnight and didnt finish till around 7am this morning. After that i had abit of a kip and then it was off to uni to hand the sodding thing in.

Earlier on in the week i experieced one of the most nerve wracking football experiences of my life. The whole match was a rollercoaster ride we went down and up and up some more only to come crashing back down AND THEN extra time AND THEN bloody penalties and it was soooo close but Schwarzer the God of stopping penalties did his busssiness.
Anyway were through again by the skin of our teeth and we have anothe match again tommorow. FA Cup 6th round against West Brom I really hope we can win this and for god's sakes please dont go to another replay i dont thinki could take it.

Oh and one other thing me and Reanne are going to some charity event do with a fancy meal and stuff and the players are oing some sort of fashion show. Which is all very cool, but now i think i need to do emergency shopping cause i dont think i have anything decent to wear.
I'm also going to try to attempt to curl my hair which i've tried before but its never worked cause my hairs rather long and thick so usually the curls dont hold."

Chelsea killed us 3-0

Poor Boro :(
We didnt start off bad, the first half was pretty even till&nbsp;Drogba scored just before the end of the first half. My poor boys, i still love ya, Chelsea are just big meanies at least there not winning the league this year ner ner, ner ner ner!

At least we've got the FA Reply on Tuesday we are so going to own Bristol City, I cant wait."

"event","Oh my fricking God!
Goal 2 is THE most amazing football film ever.

It's so good me and Reanne have decided we have to see it again at least once but most probably twice.

It was also quite abit of a fangirl fest. Seriously i think it wore us out trying not to squee and genrally go fangirl crazy in the cinema.
But the thing was totally awesome and there was loads of cameos and uite abit of screen time for the Real Madrid players and you got to see quite a few football matches as well as seeing them training..

AND

there a part with Iker which&nbsp;really just&nbsp;killed me it was just guh words fail me. (I wont give it away but for any Iker fans you'll love it)

Plus there was lots of pretty&nbsp;Sergio&nbsp;and Beckham

AND

WOODGATE!!!!!!!!! *is dead again*

okay i've ran out of adjectives to describe how amazing it is, but all i'm going to say is when it comes to a cinema near you GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!
Your life isnt worth living if you dont cause you'll miss the awesomness.&nbsp;

It also had a good sub story to it which was pretty cool and a it was all to be continued at the end which makes me want even more."

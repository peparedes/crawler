I don;t even know who cares anymore.
This will be my last journal entry.
Why?
Because I have made a mistake. I made a mistake in my actions.
and that mistake cost me a VERY dear friend. Never again will I be able to share moments with this person. All because of changes that happened within me and the unfortuinate ability to not cope with or understand what I have become. I hurt again. Hurt like I have felt before and all because of my weaknesses.

I want people to know that this was not something I wanted; it was a mistake and I wish with all my heart I could take it back. Alas we are judged by our actions and mine were those of a desprate person; a person desperately clinging to what little he had left of his past. 
I forced it all away.
I miss our talks, I miss our time. For now I have only my memories.
I wanted so much to be a part of your life and now It will never happen because of misunderstanding of myself and the inability to communicate.
I'm sorry.
From the bottom of my soul I am sorry.
There will be no comments to this.
If any of my friends want to talk or just ask questiosn. My e-mail is there.


once again; I wish things could have been different, I wish I never had to change into what I became."

I think I should now, many of you don't know, although there is someone who does. (and you know who you are.) 
A few months ago I was involved in an moderate car accident involving me, and apparently a runaway semi.
After fixing my car for light damage due to being run off the road and being shipped to the local hospital for a minor head wound I returned to my daily grind.
I started having migraine strength headaches almost daily since then.
Before AB I went to visit the doctor and had tests run and an MRI.

Needless to say I recieved the results this morning and life changes for me in the next 8 months.

....
{EDIT}

In my addled state of little sleep I realized ( After a phone call or two) This has serious potential to be either something tragic or a sick April fool's joke.
I assure you..I totally forgot what day it was and the two thoughts shouuld have been separated.

I'm fine. results are not dangerous to me at all AND I'm re-evaluating my situation and setting a deadline of 8 months for myself.
I realize that this could have been an awsome Fool's day or ""Rick-roll"" but, in all honesty I wasn't planning on it.
Sorry, My bad."

"event","Well then, This is it.
I have a place when I can put my thoughts in order and write what comes to mind but, apparently this is not so.
Apparently this sanctum is actually a place for people to step up on their own moral soapboxes and proceed to tell me what I am thinking and how I'm feeling.

My last post was vague, why? I didn't feel like talking about my mundane issues but, since I haden't posted in a while I figured I'd just let people know I was still here.
SO what happened?
A few of you let you imaginations run wild and decided in your infinate wisdom and god-like clairvoyance what I was thinking and my emotional state at the time I posted.
This is MY journal. NOT yours.
You have an issue? contact me. I've had the same E-mail address since High School.
I have a PHONE too..You could try calling me..Oh wait that's WAY too much trouble for you folks. It's easier to snipe from the internet. Not that you would know how I was feeling anyway since some of you haven't contacted me in YEARS.
I don't need any of your ""advice"". Some of you have no right to even look at my situation and make either assumption or judgment based on your own situations.
I listened to one of you at first and chose my path and started to live that way according to that advice; which by the way you contradicted in one of those idiotic posts.

Once again. You could contact me. MY GODDAMN E-MAIL IS IN MY PROFILE!
You have an issue write me there we'll discuss.
When you do things like this it makes me feel like all you want to do is hear yourselves talk and justify your own adgendas. You have your own journals for that put that shit there.
If I wanna read it I will. 

No one's forcing you to read this. I write what I feel and what's going through my mind. So unless any of you is a licenced psychotherapest I suggest you keep the assumptions to yourselves. I don't want to hear them. If you have to know, you could ask in a polite way.
I've listened to some pretty shitty advice so far and am dealing with the hand I was delt. You all have your own problems to deal with and some of you are a thousand times farther away from where I am in my life in terms of dealing with it.
I can confadantly say while I may not feel good, I can stand.

Consider this journal closed till further notice.

If you want to know what's going on, show some intitive. There are many ways of contacting me (though I doubt they'll be used) I'm tired of chasing peoples lives and wanting to know what's going on and asking questions; where in my case you apparently decided not to.
 I realize that not all folks are not involved in this but, I'm tired of catering to people, I don't have time or energy for that right now.

For the record...You were All WRONG about what it was that bothered me."

"event","quick review of this weekend...
<lj-cut>
AWA was good. I did alot better at the ally than I had thought. I made some monies; I mean, I didn't have a table and I only brought a few things to sell so not so bad for only having 1 product and no set up as well as having to borrow table space.
I had to do the best I could so, as they say "" Needs must as the devil drives.""

Overall as all things go, there was good and bad. Con drama, which admittedly was ALL my FAULT. No excuses here. I did it to myself. I couldn't deal with it, I honestly don't know why it happened. I really can't explain myself. The only thing I could come up with was that I haven't talked to anyone in months. I mean really TALKED to; face to face. My social skills and my overall dealing with people skills is at an all time low. I really don't have to deal with anyone here. Friendly or otherwise. It just wasn't the reactions I wanted to have.
I think the sudden explosion of social interaction literally drove me mad.

Anyway..a few shouts to some folks out there:
The convention folks mad this a really awesome event, Major props there.
The guest of honor was Noboru Ishiguro the director of such EPIC series as Starblazers or Battleship Yamato, Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Macross. Amazing insight into the industry. I remembered alot of these series when I was a kid and it was great to hear him talk about these works that made my childhood filled with thoughts of heroes and bravery. a very talented and generous too! Gifting us with actual PRODUCTION cells from the Archives of the studio! Very awesome!

Bunch of awesome folks in cos-play! Sweet!
I'll be uploading what few pictures I took. Seeing as Chibi was shutter crazy this weekend and hase TONS more than I have.

Artists alley crew was awesome, Caught up with some of my old friends from my Katsucon days, Jim, Dave, Owen and Leo; as well as Dizzy and some great new faces. 

A really BIG shout out to Allison ( <lj user=""jayamichan""> )A big thanks and big hugs for letting me have a little table space, The chats about general stuff and life crap, the chats about your work; Which keep getting better everytime I see them. BTW: Please read that book. I'm sure that it will help you as much as it helped me. I never would have gotten back on the art band wagon without it.

To Bob and Emily DeJesus: I know you guys don't read my LJ but, you know I just want to thank you for being an awesome inspiration and you always teach me something new. Whether it's a new technique, a new program or just a perspective I hadn't thought of.  I just want to say thanks and showing us artists where we can go and what is possible.

To Liz..WOW! Talk about a serendipitous meeting! I never expected you to be there! I loved the costume BTW, I didn't get a chance to say that so, I guess I'll say that here and Hope Gendo reads this and lets you know. ^_^

And last but not least I want to say thanks to a good friend. Thanks for putting up with my weirdness. I'm glad we got this chance to spend some time. I'm glad that you took the time to try to get me back in the game. To try to get that ember of cons past to spark. 
I know it's not an excuse but, I think I will always be weird if I'm not behind a table. Once you taste that kind of feeling I think nothing will ever be the same at a con. You just don't know what to do. Your perception of ""what to do"" at a con changes.
It felt kind like I was wondering aimless because I haven't attended a con as an attendee in YEARS. So, thanks for taking the lead and helping me enjoy somethings I otherwise wouldn't have enjoyed.
Keep doing what you're doing. Your work this time was perfect, You were amazing this year and I can not wait to see what else you have in store for the upcoming events. As always I eagerly await to see what you have in store. Enjoy the attention. You deserved it!

Well, I'll try to do a proper con report tomorrow but, for now..Sleep."

A long week. Nobody but me and the dog.
Kinda strange. Being alone now is a lot different than it used to be.
I'm not sure if I'm acclimating to it. I know I don't like it. It just feels ..meh.
I'm rather unenthuiastic about ..well everything.
Got a phone call from a friend today.
Really brightened my week. It's good to hear from folks once in a while. 
Helps validate the old existance.
It was nothing specual, no huge breakthroughs, just a nice chat. It felt very good to hear a familiar voice.
I know I've said this before but, it is tough out here. So far away from home. I want to go back to a place that's familiar to me. A place that I can call home. I've never been able to say that about anywhere before. 
Home.

"event","I'm a little angry. 
Why you ask and why this late at night? Well lets just say I've had time to do some thinking, while staring at my cealing.
We all have issues. I do, you do, your mom/dad does, your dog. your cat...you get the point.
My <i>point</i> is simply this; when you have a person..ANY person, you can talk to about your problems dosen't that make you feel a little better?
You know why it feels better?..Because that person cares about you. For one moment in time someone wants to listen to YOU. 
Deep down we all want to be listened to but, somewhere in society we have drilled into our heads that we have to compare and contrast our issues and problems to everyone elses.

""Oh well..i'm having a crap-tastic day..BUT, YOU are obviously WORSE SO..My issues don't count."" 
argh! >.<  WHY?

Then; you subjegate your own feelings and all the other person wanted was to help you feel like someone cared but, now they feel like they're the one intruding and bothering..and you can see where this awkward circle of events can go.
So, I am mad that this has happened to me alot lately.
I'm sad that all I've felt in the last week, is hurt, sad, lonely and angry.
I've felt nothing really good this week.
I've not felt like this for a ..well..I just haven't felt like this for a while.
I'm tired of subjugating my feelings. I feel horrible. I hate feeling like this because NOTHING good EVER comes of it. The last time I felt like this it took quite a while to get out of it.
So, as I sated I quit. I'm tired of trying to MAKE people feel like someone cares. If you can't figure it out; GO TO SOMEONE ELSE.
I'm not wasting time or effort if people just ignore it. It's obvious to me that my efforts are wasted sometimes.
Fine. 
I'm tired and angry. This is just venting because I've nobody here to vent to.
I'm going to bed again..hurt and unhappy, to wake up to a busy day trying to put the last week behind me."

It just seems lately I'm further away from everything I used to know.
I can't focus and it just seems that I'm frighteningly alone.
My parents are leaving for a vacation so, I will be truely alone for a week.
I just can't connect with ANYONE here. No one shares my intrests and the closet friend is like 10 hours away. I know I'm a very social animal so, this is just killing me.
I need to keep busy and maybe I can ignore it. 
Hit a bump in my life right now...Hopefully that will be smoothed out soon.

I had an invitation from a very good friend which I take very seriously and with a very happy heart. That someone would think to extend that kindness to me made me feel just a little better.
I hope that soon I can find that spark again. Until I do, I need to keep plodding along and find that spark. It's not that far..but, it always seems just out of my reach.

This past week has been hard on me, Harder on others I'm sure. My memories often drift to days past and a friend now gone. It saddens me that my world has become a bit smaller and makes me think about how brief our existance is."

Talked to someone that I haven't talked to in a while, and things went okay. It started kinda rocky but, eventually it felt like the old talks. It was good.
It made me think, which this person always does. Makes me think. 
How can somebody know so much about a person that the mere sound of the voice can provoke such clarity of thought? Who knows? Maybe...that's part of my pearl.
In retrospect, my revelation during my slight insanity was something of a comfort. While I want to know what that was, what great cosmic truth was revealed; I'd rather not go crazy to figure it out. To those who know the story, I need to find the pearl on my own.

I've taken to watching Doctor Who again. I'm currently downloading as many eps. as I can find. I have all the recent series and am looking for the OLD SCHOOL series. Most notably the Third (Jon Pertwee) and Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker), which I grew up with watching public television. I loved that show. It was pretty cool for the time. 
<lj user=""hatori_1181""> told me there was a MASSIVE torrent with like, every epsisode EVER. Can't seem to find that...If you have a link buddy, throw it in an e-mail.

Been reading and scribbling. Maybe I'll have something ready for Neko-con.
I'm hoping I can finish the SoulCalibur chibi's. There's always that plan.
 
The dog has taken to sleeping in my room, a habit that she'll have to be cured of seeing as I probably won't be around later. I don't want it to end up like fry's dog and waiting for someone that won't come home. I don't want to break a puppies heart. I'm not THAT much of a

I actually slept.
<Lj user =""zenboiuke""> and <lj user=""hatori_1181""> Thanks guys..quiet contemplation and meditation worked.
It's been a while since I worked it out like that.
I'm feeling much better I must have fallen asleep somewhere around 4am. I don't rightly remember It just happened. I'm feeling much better. Exhausted but, much better I think I'll take a few cat naps today.
My mind is quiet strangly enough. It's gotta be the search for the pearl. I worked on trying to find that for along time, not that I found it or anything it's just metaphoric. While the story is simple finding it is the hard part.

While I am saddened that some don't understand what happened to me. ( I rightly don't understand why this really happened either.) It's over I think.
I hope.
I can say one thing. I figured it out I think. The chaos and turmoil of my head is clear.
For the first time in over a week I think I'm better off.
I've lost some things in this process but, all healing comes at a price. You have to be hurt before you can heal and while I have lost; I know I'll be stronger for it some how, as cliche as that sounds.

""<i>Some things are worth getting your heart broken for...</i>""

It's true.
I'm glad I have the strength to say that now. While I don't like it and it's not ""fair"". I can't argue with it.
I have to thank you for the time. All that time. Wonderful.
I'd not trade it for anything else in the world.

"event","Just a review of my trip behind the cut.
<lj-cut>
Actually, it really wasn't that bad.
I arrived on Tuesaday night and promptly...well..let's just say I went to sleep.

Wednesday: I spent with <lj user=""aki_amano""> ,<lj user=""hatori_1181"">, <lj user=""tuberatn""> and Rick. It was awsome. It was full of Katrina, Old school Video games, much talking and chinese food for the win.
Night: okay..not great but, okay.

Thursday: 

Morning: not so good. 

Afternoon: Walking around and Chicken n' Chips with <lj user=""hatori_1181""> and meeting <lj user=""happy_goth""> at Castro's for a refill on my Vanilla Black Cavendish. Shortly after <lj user=""happy_goth""> had to go sleep. I noticed the sun glinting off the purple tipped locks of <lj user=""aki_amano""> as she made her way to Swan's chocolate. The next destination to meet <lj user=""darcy_chan"">! Wow, It has been a long time since we talked but, the four of us (myself,  <lj user=""aki_amano"">, <lj user=""hatori_1181""> and <lj user=""darcy_chan"">) Enjoyed the tasty win that was Gelato and sweets! Mmmm! ^_^ happy!

Night: Club and Denny's! 
It's been forever! much talk and <lj user=""gozolve""> got his copy of Sandman Vol.1 he was happy. ^_^ Good. 
After Denny's went to room, it was okay again.

Anime-fest in a nutshell: 1st day of Anime fest was amazing! So many fun stuffs! <lj user=""hatori_1181""> and I FINALLY got a chance to meet in the arena that is SoulCalibur; what a match! You sir, have earned my respect!
<lj user=""project_jko""> and I revisited our Cassi/Sophie Vs. The Meatball (Charade) Battles. Amazing! After all this time we can still manage to put on a show!  <lj user=""project_jko""> using Sophie to bend the matrix to her will produced some of the most amazing battles I've seen in a long time.

Went to Dinner with long time friend <lj user=""cleartuesday""> and Jeremy. We talked Games and caught up. I was still kinda shaken from the past few days (sorry guys. I promise I'll be more sociable next time.)

Stayed up VERY LATE. Too late..but, my brain was buzzing with...thoughts.
Sorry  <lj user=""aki_amano"">, I really didn't mean to sleep at the kitchen table.

Saturday I went to hang with <lj user=""happy_goth""> it was cool. I miss her so much. It's like that sister you never had kinda thing. But...well, things weren't good and I was kinda upset. ( see previous post for mental state check)Thanks <lj user=""hatori_1181""> for talking me down.

Sunday: Well..day started out better. Talked. Which was good. Didn't really fix anything but, talking was better than leaving it like that. 

<lj user=""happy_goth""> and I went to see <b>Transformers</b>.
O.M.G.
Best 23 year wait for an AWSOME movie. 
""My Name is Optimus Prime."" Turned me into a 10 year old. It was the best.

Returned to the house, Watched Shakugan no Shana with  <lj user=""aki_amano"">, it was good. Then I had to leave.

Worst part of the day: Saying, Goodbye. Hardest words I've spoken in a long time.

Plane trip was okay. Except the part about flying 55 minutes WEST due to weather conditions. Then an hour delay on my connecting flight. OH! and best topper to the trip. My bag is lost. Yep, They lost my bag during the connection flight debacle.
So, I didn't get into my car until 3 am; With a 3 hour drive home.
Yay.
All in all, a really good time was had.
Somethings didn't work out. Somethings did.
Now, I'm home. Back to the useless grind of this horrible job and the hopes of searching for a new silver lining.
I'm a lot worse for wear (learning scars and all.)but, as always. I'll be okay.
In the end, I'm always okay."

"event","I want to make something <i>CRYSTAL</i> clear:

I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR MY JOURNAL EVER.
If you are reading this journal you want to know about my inside workings so I will never <b>hide</b> anything behind ""friends only"" or any filters.
The only things I have ever hidden have been posts for my own private thoughts and I have six of those posts since starting this journal.
if you don't want to know about this don't read beyond the cut.
<lj-cut text=""Bad days...""> 
Well, I managed to make SEVERAL mistakes.
Some emotionally fatal. It's not a good place to be.
I'm coming to the conclusion that I am not at fault.  I can not take responsibility for all this. I won't.
I held no gun to anyone's temple to make their decisions. I did not force anyone to preform any actions of any kind.
I will not allow someone to ignore the guilt of their actions because they want me to believe that it's ""My fault."" that decisions were made. I made my own decisions but, others made theirs. I didn't make all the decisions in this situation and I will not bear the burden of the guilt that were not mine to make.
I did everything I could and I am learning that my feelings are oft times ignored. I did what I could given the time constraints. I had no time to come to equilibrium. I arrived at my destination on tuesday of this week at 12:30 at 1:45 the rest of my week was overshadowed by a film of misery and depression.
It is now Sunday, and I have made the biggest mistake of my life. I pushed an issue I should have waited on but, I needed to put the pieces together. I cannot stand not knowing where all the pieces I have found fit.
I will apologize for the manner in which I acted but, I'm hurt now and will be for a very long time.
I was told I had to uphold my word, I said I would do that and I will. Even though another set of words spoken to me, will be completely ignored.
<b>I</b> have to keep my word. Once again, I have the full responsibility of my words and promises and others words and promises can be ignored.
I don't know how to do this.
I lose everything in this situation and others expect to lose nothing and come out of this with good social standing and everything in healthy order.
I'm HURT damn it.
I'm an emotional wreck and I do <b>not</b> have to remain calm, I need time to sort this out! It's not fair that I have to sort out my life and take all of this in stride in less than a few days.
I came here to relax and look forward to some things that my life was missing and what happened? 
I lost EVEN more. 
Am I crazy? Yes. 
Am I uncomfortable and an emotional wreck? Yes.    
Why did this happen? I'll probably never know. 
It's going to take alot to fix this part of my life now.
The worst part of this is that no matter what, I will probably never be able to fix this.
Multiple times I have wished that I could close my eyes and this would all be a horrible dream but, that is not the case at all. I'm forced to acknowledge the grim realization that one of the best times of my life is now over and I will never return to that time."

Late night Incedent: It was good but, it reminded me of what happened. It made me feel..empty. I can feel that tightening feeling in my chest.
I wanna be someone else until I get to work.
I want to be a person with a destiny that isn't mine.

You'll be the vein
You'll be the pain
You'll be the scar
You'll be the road, rolling below
The wheels of a car
And all of the thoughts, on God
Don't know if I'm strong enough now
You'll be the vein
You'll be the pain
You'll be the

EQ, CoH/CoV, GW, DoC, PlanetSide, WoW, FF11 and even D&DOL
I just don;t know why I can't play these games like other people. I love games. I love these worlds. I just can't seem to play them with the vigor that somepeople can. 
I mean, I've played games before. I have TONS ove Ps,ps2,Nintendo even Dreamcast games. I play them all the time and have lots of fun.
(XenoGears..hells yeah!)
I don't know if it's just a gamer thing or what. I just can't play these things and enjoy them like I do console games.
Maybe I just need a good group of players.
EQ was fun when Me, Barry, Laughing boy and Al used to play. It was kinda cool.

No matter what I do. I try to distract myself with creative endouvers and all it does is remind me of a life I once had. 
Can you go back? is it possible to return to the feelings and passions that you once had or do the dreams of youth permently loose their luster?
Falling forever into a darkened well where all lost dreams go? Only to bubble up once in a while to remind you of said lost youth?

"event","SO I busted out the old SC3..
I felt the need, the need for a beat down.
My day has gone from bad to worse. SO I needed stress relief.
Aaaaannnnd....WTF!?
My skills are TEH SUCK!
OMG...I lost to the Royal Guard WHORE. NOT once, NOT twice...but, <b><i>FIVE</i></b> times?!?!
With Taki of all people. ARGH! I need to do some serious training..I remember when I was walking..WALKING through that game.
Now, I'm lucky if I can limp.
So, I started a new save game, on a new card. I'm starting from scratch and bringing my skills back where they should be.
I need to be back where I could sit with the controler and give a good fight to all challengers.
Damn..WTF happened?
Argh..."

"event","Thanks for the posts of confedence all!
It was actually a spacific person..but, it's okay now. 
I really don't like losing touch with people.
Lj at least lets me keep up with you all in some fashion.
I always read posts (eventhough I don;t always Comment) and in that way I keep up to date with most things. It's when folks dissappear off the radar completly that worries me sometimes.
I'll try to keep up here so you all know what's going on with me, Good or bad.
I try not to make this an E-M-O journal but, I figure those who read this maybe want to know what's going on in my head, even if I don't know what's happening.
Well..more posts later. I need to go into WORK on MY DAY OFF for a stupid meeting...it's 45 minutes. :P
(See, I told you I was dedicated)"

No calls. No text replies.
It makes me think and I feel bad enough already."

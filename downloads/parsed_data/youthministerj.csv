"event","The kids are all snuggled up in their rooms we're trying to get them to sleep. Word of advice, avoid hotels with really good vending machines in them because you will have kids constantly knocking on your door asking you if you can watch them go get some candy. They're so hyped up on junk food they probably won't get to bed until late. They're also really excited about going to Rockefeller Center tomorrow for ice skating. We're waking them up extra early to go skating and than we'll be returning later that night to see the tree all lit up. Anyways back to my entry title, I want my children to read this and hopefully gain something from the things I have to say. In your life you will have people come and go. Some of them you probably won't like very much and other's you will absolutely love. The truth is that nothing lasts forever and you have to really understand and accept that. It may take something dramatic to happen in your life for you to fully grasp this concept. Friendships are a learning experience you will learn things about yourself you probably never knew, some of them are good, some are bad, but you accept them and move on. Sometimes you may find yourself in a relationship where you may feel that you are turning into someone you don't like or don't recognise anymore and that is when you need to find the inner strength to just let go. It may take days, weeks, maybe years, but after you learn to accept it and let it go than you will suddenly feel a sense of calm and relief. Of course naturally that part of your life will never be forgotten, but you will be forever changed. You should take it and grow from it. Realise the mistakes you made and try not to make the same mistakes in the next relationship you find yourself in. Also many of you who are going off to high school may experience the pressures of wanting to be popular and wanting to fit in, but once you graduate and face the real world you realise that while it may have been a wonderful or horrible experience, and you may have made some good friends, this is when the test of those friendships really start. Once you hit the real world it doesn't matter how many friends you have or who you hang out with, to society you are just another person drifting through life like everyone else. If you can make those true friendships even if it is just a few than it's like everyone says, you are truly a rich man. You will realise one day who is worth your friendship and who your true friends are and I hope that each and every one of you will find that one group of people who will just make your life absolutely amazing."

"event","We're taking a small break dropping in at a local McDonald's for some lunch and relaxation. I also have some news that I would like to get off my chest. Only my wife and I know about this. I wasn't sure if I wanted to discuss this during our retreat. However, when we got to St. Patrick's I felt it to be a more appropriate time to discuss the matter with the children. They were very understanding and very sadden by the news of my departure from the youth ministry program. I have been offered a job as a Administrative Assistant for the Campus Ministry program at a Catholic high school in Louisville. I'm not disclosing any names or anything like that but I have decided to accept the job. Eventually we will be moving, but my wife and I have been pressed for time and haven't really looked at any kind of realty in Louisville. I have transfered my credits (Which thankfully they all transfered) to the University of Louisville and will be attending for the Spring semester. I will miss all of the people we have made close bonds with, but I feel this is a great opportunity especially for someone like me who still gets to work with kids, but also gets to experience a High School environment, which is where I am hoping to be teaching within the next 2 years. I have enjoyed my time in Lexington and will be back to visit. It's only an hour away by freeway so I promise I'll be back. I will miss you all and will keep you all in my prayers."

"event","I'm making this public to inform everyone that we did finally move and everything went fine. The new place is exactly what we were looking for and it has plenty of room for our growing family. Thank you all for your prayers and we will be having a house warming party as soon as we get settled in. On another note <b>WE WILL BE HAVING YOUTH NIGHT WEDNESDAY. </b>It won't be as long as it usually is, but it is just going to be a chance for us to get together and have a nice meal before Thanksgiving. It's also a chance to give thanks to God for everything he has given us. You're welcome to bring guests and we will be having a lot of parents volunteering to cook food so be sure to thank them."

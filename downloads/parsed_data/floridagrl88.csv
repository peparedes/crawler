You fall in love quickly and easily. And very often.

You give and take equally in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

monday: had to come earlier at like 7:15 in the morn.... learned like 7 pages of drill..... learned rifle and flag routine..... got soaked from stupid tuba players..... was really angry cause i couldn't go to county line that nite..... but M., Brit, Marcus, and me hung out anyway...... went to ruben's house...... slept all nite

tuesday: woke up early again..... learned more drill and routines...... sweated ass off...... but got soaked again..... andrew came to teach us dance...... walked like a model and crazy head moves......... can't remember anymore

wednesday: slept in half hour...... learned more drill and routines.... lunch got soaked by water guns from occeal(?)and nestor....... came back for nite practice....... M. and me lost our drill charts..... found mine and M. didn't.... when leaving got ambushed again by occeal(?) and nestor by water balloons....... M. forgot her sunglasses on the field........ she drove with her car all the way out there to find they weren't there......... took me home

thursday(today): slept in again....... learned more drill and routines.....mom came this morning to chaperone........ almost died after we did a run through........ not even through 3 songs yet....... got schedule....... not right have to change it........ lost my flag.... angry but happy at same time..... M. found her drill chart and sunglasses...... now waiting to go back for nite practice

3 things i love about band camp: 
* the fruit we get at 10:30 break
* seeing every other section get in trouble
* seeing the funny costumes ppl wear during theme nites

3 things i hate bout band camp:
* nasty tan lines
* getting yelled at for no good reason
* the hot hot sun

well tomorrow is a new day. and the last day. well not intirely. we have to come saturday morin for the show for the parents and pics. yippee! band rented the county pool tomorrow nite. get to stay there. also before there are no sectionals in afternoon. we get to watch the funny skits sections made up.

FRANKIE J LYRICS
""How To Deal""

Sometimes a girl has to choose
And do something she doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my guy
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream
I gotta do this for me
Cuz if I don't I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope

[Chorus:]
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it
How do I deal with 
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live...how do I deal without you

It's killing me to know 
That your heart's with me
But you're with her cause I chose
To be in this high school thing
Flags, school, mall and dicks come along with luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it
But this is the life that I was given
So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime without you

[Chorus]

How do you deal when you wanna be with
the one you love but the one you love is
with somebody else
What do you do when you know he don't love her
but he love me but he cant stand lovin' you faraway
you just deal with it,deal with it 
(I dont wanna have to live with it)
you just deal with it,deal with it 
(no,no,no)
you just deal with it,deal with it
(I dont want nobody else alovin' you)
you just deal with it,deal with it
(I dont nobody else alovin' me)

[Chorus]

How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it.......

so yea i went to county line with some friends. saw tons of people from school. danced with this guy. who i didn't get a name or number with. boo hoo. yea some drama went down with M. and her guy. don't know full story of what happened. but i was there and totally can't wait to get to band camp at 12 to talk to her about what happened last night. had to leave there at like 10 cause i had to be home by 11. which totally sucked. i guess that is what i get for being not honest with my parents and disobeying their every rule. we had like 6 people in the car i went in. i went with aubs. B.W., Cait., Shiann, and kayla. the four of us had to sit in the back crammed. while b.w. sat in the front driving with aubs in the passenger seat. you see b.w. drives a red convertable. don't know the name brand of the car. but man the back can really only fit like 3 ppl at the most. so yea  we were totally crammed. plus he had the top down. talk about hair getting so messed up and knotty. but oh well it was fun. soo goin back like the monday before school starts. heck yes. everyone will be there. lol. well i gotta get ready for practice.

"event","sooo yea went white water rafting and ropelling. i also got to go tubing down this freezing cold river. that was fun. just paddleing down the stream relaxing. i also did some rock climbing on a fake rock wall. got all the way to the top. only cause i was climbing on the easy side. lol! we also went to this really kewl place called ""blue hole"" it is this kind of dried out part of this river, where the 1996 kayak olympics was held. there was still parts in the river were you could swim. it was so kewl. like there are rocks all over this place. you can swim through the rocks under water through like these tunnels. i did it and it was pretty awesome. kind of hard to explain. you'd have to visit it yourself. we also did some hiking through the mountains. it is soo pretty up north. gosh i wish florida had hills or mountains. the view from up top is gorgeous.  so yea from the short of it that was my fun field vacation. now i'm back home and goin to flags. i've got to practice rifles. kind of grounded right now, as always. so i'm pretty much bored unless i'm workin or hangin out. R. fixed his car finally, but to our luck it broke down again. gosh! such a long story. mom almost threatened to kick me out of the house. not much talkin goin on betweeen us. i'm sooo emotionally stressed out. i might not ast like it, but man do i have big time issues goin on. wutever my problems are they are R.'s too. and vice-a-versa. wut would i do w/out him. we'd be so lost w/out each other. it's hard enough not bein able to hang out with him regularly on a daily basis. to everyone out there who can be with whoever they want and love. some advice is don't screw anything up with your partner or your parents. you are the lucky ones. is anyone else kind of wishin school will come soon? i am , but then again, not. just my report card today too. not a surprise. got straight A's. soo yea i'm back home and lovin it. not!

"event","Hey everyone! 
did ya guys miss me?! i know you all had to. lol! so first let me tell you how my trip went. we left sunday morning and drove to this camp site called Stone Mountain in georgia. we satyed the nite there. the mountain was huge. we didn't have time to climb it. though i wish we would had stayed there longer. the place was awesome. had water slides, huge lake, rides, and all sorts of stuff to do there. one thing we did do while we were there for the nite was watch the amazing laser show the place did on the side of the mountain at nite. it was kewl. so yea left there monday morning. drove some more and arrived at Eagle camp in tenn. at like 1 in the afternoon. arrived just in time for lunch. so monday all we really did was unpack, eat, and sleep. we also hiked through the mountain trails they have. my week was such a freakin blast. i learned how to ropell. we ropelled off of a 60 foot tower. it was so scary at first. but man it was fun and gave you such an adrenline rush. so did the white water rafting i did too. that was sooo awesome too. we went down class 3 and 4 rapids. though it was kind of scary cause while we were there this group went down a rapid and 4 ppl fell out. one they pulled back in the raft and 2 went down the river. one held on a rock forever. so to make a story short. they all had to go to the hospital and came out with bruisees and cuts, and one lady got minor neck and back injury. so scary. i didn't fall out once. though there were times i felt like i was going to. the water was freezing cold. well i soo have to tell you the rest of my adventure, but i gotta go right now. it's my parents anneversary and i got to get ready to go to dinner.
write later when i get home.

"event","i think i just realized that my life isn't perfect. i mean i alrady knew that it wasn't but it was goin good for me. i mean i have great friends and an awesome boyfriend. but today i wasn't that sure about anything anymore. i mean today it all really clicked in my head. i mean i know i've had alot of problems in my life lately but i'm not the only one. i realized today that it's just not about me!!! what i do affects everyone around me. like today i felt really distant from everyone, including R. i've messed up soo badly w/ everyone and everything like i felt today as if i really didn't exist anymore. ppl are used to now just ignoring me cause of how i act. i don't want that. i took everything for granted. my mom's trust, my boyfriend, and my friends included. like i never really thought about how anyone else felt. it was all about me and how things work out in my favor. but ya know i realized today that, that's not how life goes. i felt unloved by everyone today. i wasn't happy at all. usually ppl are there to comfort me and make things better. but today it was the other way around. i was soo used to everything bein about me. i need to really take time and fix my priorities. i know i always say that, but believe me i'm really tryin. if i didn't have great friends who are still there for me (even though i'm a bitch to them) then my life would be completely out of whack. my day was even worse too cause like it's that time of the month and i'm sick. i can't even breath out of my nose it's soo stuffy. maybe everything is to blame on my moodiness of the week. but anyway i love ya all out there who are my closest friends. ya guys know who ya are. so enough of my complaining.
feel like a nobody for once!!!!!!!

p.s. to end on a good note. yesterday at my lacrosse game the JV won 10-0. yay!!! and VARSITY won 13-5. now for JV it's win 3 lost 2. we are improving!!!!! also the math portion on the F-CAT was hard. but i think i did good on the reading and math parts. i hope everyone else did too. and good luck one the nrts on thursday.

You tend to be a stubborn lover, holding your ground in every argument
You take your time falling in love. You aren't the type to lose perspective.
You are loyal (to a fault), and you require the same loyalty in your sweetheart.
At your best, you are a wise and inspiring partner - who sticks around.</td></tr></table>

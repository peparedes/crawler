<P><BR>now lets discuss <STRONG>voodoo blue</STRONG>. <STRONG>dan's voice</STRONG> is beautiful. but its way too emo. they played all new stuff xcept 3 songs. he cannot do <STRONG>mike's</STRONG> part, its just not good. the new songs were freakin awesome, but it strays away from their rock feel. one was kind of poppy and one was kinda hardcore. <STRONG>clunky</STRONG> needs to never sing again. the few screams were cute tho. all in all, it was good. if mike was never in it, i would love them. but i miss mike too much, its not the same. i will cry a river now, thanks.</P>
<P><BR>i need to take a poll on my <STRONG>cat paw tattoo idea</STRONG>: i was gonna get them little in pairs going up my stomach. but i thought about the getting fat or pregnant thing, although i know you use coco butter, but it could get nasty. i was thinking up the lower part of my leg, like wrapping around. but theres bone and shit there and that might hurt or look gay. so what should i do...any other spots?</P>"

theres a few people i used to kill to be friends with, then i didnt want to let them go for the world, theyve slowly started falling out of my life, and i need to push them out completely. theyve just been hanging there tearing me apart without even knowing it. i need to pretend they dont exsist. i need new friends.
i don't know why i left my old life style, im such an idiot. everytime i drive down 32, entering carroll county, i get a huge smile and get really happy. im surrounded by everything im used to, and i run into the ones i like. i realized i did like a good bit of ya'll ;)
sometimes i miss century, just the routine of it all. seeing keri's huge smile in the hall. justin picking me up and hugging me. the hi how are you's to middle school friends. seeing emily's new shiny outfit everyday.

he told me not to go home tonite, but i didnt wanna stay up all night by myself and wake up early for him to leave and for me to lay there all day by myself. but being here alone sucks more, i shoulda stayed with him. i always miss sleeping next to him, but when im there sometimes my insomnia kicks in. i wish it was still summer so he could spend all week with me.
i remember the first 4 days we spent together, with no parents. they were so much fun. we learned so much about each other. we fell in love that week.
why do they call it FALLING in love? falling is usually seen as a bad thing, but i guess love turns out bad 9 outta 10 times. tho it wasnt love if it ends up bad...i talk in circles.

school is definitely second in life.
rather, i pick the school where everything i like is around. rather then picking the school i like and having to adapt to a new surrounding.
were trying to move november 1st, sick.
yesterday boyfriend pants and i saw national lampoon's gold diggers. it was really terrible, but eric from boy meets world was in it so i had to see it.

<P>then we saw <STRONG>wicker park</STRONG>. and the movie was fuckin sweet. the way it was filmed was cool and you couldnt figure the movie out no matter how hard you try. although i realized <STRONG>josh harnett</STRONG> looks way too much like <STRONG>my brother</STRONG>. </P>
<P>the mall was closed on our way out, we were the only ones walkin thru and we talked and talked and laughed and laughed. we proceeded to kiss in the rain: and i can definitely say that<EM> he stood (at my door) with his hands on my waiste and kissed me like he ment it, and i knew, that he ment it. </EM>i spent the nite at his house and&nbsp; (as <STRONG>sara</STRONG> would say) <EM>we did the things that boyfriends and girlfriends do when no ones around. </EM>he made me mashed potatoes too.</P>
<P>today <STRONG>laurren</STRONG> and i went shopping in <STRONG>georgetown</STRONG>. the town was really pretty minus the dirty water. its so weird seeing people walking across or down the street, you never saw that in cow county. i will admit, i love the country life. i spent 8 million dollars and i really shouldnt have. but whatever, my dad bribs me with his money and it works. haha</P>

"event","i am so happy. he makes me so happy. he is so wonderful, even when he sleeps or plays his guitar instead of paying attention to me. but when he holds me and makes weird sounds and faces and makes fun of me and tickles me, its the most fun ever. i can never stop laughing. he feeds me and helps me up and helps me out all the time, he does what he can to make me happy. gosh he succeeds.
but for some reason when im alone, or watching him sleep (or anytime when hes not holding me) i think about negative things. like driving off a bridge by accident, things that would never happen. or things from the past that just piss me off still - like what my best friend(s) did to me. i should be thinking ""yeah i got fucked up the ass, but look what i have now"", but instead i get sad. it goes away when he rolls over and attacks me. but it comes back at times like right now, when im alone. i think too much - it's really going to be the end of me.
i hate that i don't have matt to cry on.
i hate that someone took my place.
i hate that i don't have jason to beat me up.
i hate that i can't think of good memorys of kristin, only bad ones.
but i love him. and i only wanna be with him, i don't wanna hang out with neone else because theyve all crushed my heart, and he hasnt.
so what do i do when hes at work or practice? suck it up and hang out with these people that piss me off, yet whom i miss so much.
i am a fucking hypocrite. i cant make up my mind. its always runnin around in circles."

<P><STRONG><U>saturday:</U></STRONG> woke up at marc's after he had left for work. went to <STRONG>cow county</STRONG> to see my<STRONG> tisha</STRONG>. we did some good bonding, weve been friends since <STRONG>3rd grade</STRONG>, dont mess. then i picked up <STRONG>marc</STRONG> from work and we came back to <STRONG>my house</STRONG> to have <EM>funfun sleepy time</EM>. there was a huge <STRONG>spiderweb</STRONG> going across the walkway to my door, and a huge spider in it. i was a real man and tore that sucker down while marc stood there scared. HELLS YEAH! he insisted on drying my hair and styling it. he didnt steal the blanket or push me off the bed this time. we watched <EM>the girl next door</EM> and he held me like he was a part of me. we kissed the night away and i fell asleep happier then ever.</P>
<P><STRONG><U>sunday:</U></STRONG> had to wake up so we could get back to laurel for <STRONG>marcs next show</STRONG> at <STRONG>thunderdome</STRONG> with some shitty bands. they played fricken AMAZINGGGGGG. the sound was soooooooo good. and everyone loved him times ten. it was so cute, they played 2 acoustic songs and silly boy stopped in the middle to tune, but it was okay. they were being so funny. ah. he rules my world.<STRONG> laurren</STRONG> went with me and it was a lot of fun to bond with her again, minus being too scared to go outside. afterwards i spent the nite at <STRONG>marcs</STRONG> where we kissed the night away again. he wears these funny blue soccer pants that are tight as hell and in the shin area its like a sock. omg so hott. hahahahaha. </P>
<P><STRONG><U>monday:</U></STRONG> we layed around all day. went to <STRONG>seans</STRONG> to unload equpiment where marc decided he wasnt going to work. so we cuddeled in a chair but he kept gettin up to set up the drums and stuff cos hes <STRONG>mr perfectionist pants</STRONG>. i was sooooo sleepy. we came back to his house where i drew him pictures and talked about how cute each other is. when he said <EM>goodnite</EM> to me - <STRONG><U>2 deer watched us kiss</U></STRONG>. seriously they were in the parking lot with us. they were so cool!!!!</P>
<P>i got the <STRONG>saddest news today</STRONG>, that <STRONG>mike from voodoo blue</STRONG> is no longer. i think my life is over. theyre the only band i still enjoy watching. dan cant take over mikes place. cos he'll have to stay at the mic therefore no more crazyness. he cant do it. im throwing in my vdb towel now.

<P>so <STRONG>english</STRONG> is gonna be gay cos its all about writing essays. i love writing essays, i dont need to learn how for the 5th year. and knowing the difference between words that sound the same. i guess that means easy <EM>A</EM> for me. theres one girl in the class that looks like she'd be my friend, maybe ill ask her. haha.<STRONG> </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>reading</STRONG> is gonna be gay because duh its reading. and the teacher xpects us to use big words and be outgoing and shit. haha yeah right. he used to work for <STRONG>pbs </STRONG>and had dinner with <STRONG>barney</STRONG> once. the character took over him, he couldnt tell the difference between the character and himself so he'd switch back and forth. he was black also. </P>
<P>its so weird seeing all these different races, carroll county is SO shelterd. its also awesome cos theres no <EM>wigger</EM> (for lack of better term) kids cos they know theyd get their ass beat. minus my next door neighbor. haha. but all in all school will be cool cos im not there for long. holler.</P>
<P>so. spending the whole weekend with <STRONG>marc</STRONG>, only a few hours apart when he works saturday. you should come to his show <STRONG>friday</STRONG> at <STRONG>st johns</STRONG> and <STRONG>sunday</STRONG> at <STRONG>thunderdome</STRONG>. but most importantly thunderdome, and <U>buy a ticket from me, thanks.</U></P>

tomorrow i get up at 7, but classes are short and theres an hour in between.
i like being able to pick up markiss..i feel bad that hes gotta stay in that shit hole all day. its also gay cos he has practice, work, and sleep early. but i know it could be 1000000x worse, so im not complainin.
i saw an old friend today, i havent laughed so hard i cried in forever. it rocked.
tomorrow were lookin @ a house in ellicott city that we are 95% sure on, IM EXCITED!"

<P>when i was in <STRONG>elem school</STRONG> and i was falling asleep with a stomach ache or my parents were fighting, or just something bad, i would try to <STRONG>pray</STRONG>. id fold my little hands together and ask god to forgive me for my sins and continue with my request. if i yawned or coughed i would beg for his forgiveness. id end it with an amen, hours later falling asleep after my problem was solved. either he fixed my problem or my problem ran its course. it just ran its course. i wanted to go to sleep right then and there, dammit. i wasnt asking for much.</P>
<P><STRONG>growing up</STRONG>, never believed in god. sometimes i thought he was out there, but i dont believe in the bible or all them stories, its all bullshit. he was just some regular guy - until he proves me wrong one day thats what im stickin with. just a guy, doin his thang, not helpin me.</P>
<P><STRONG>last nite</STRONG> i couldnt sleep so i tried to pray like i did when i was a kid...i asked him for when i went to the doctor, for the doctor to fix me. what did the doctor tell me to do? listen to relaxing music. what the FUCK. my life is music, but it doesnt cure EVERYTHING. give me some drugs you fucker. its sooooo easy for someone to go in there and say they have ADD cos they cant watch tv and hear their parents at the same time and they get drugs. but me? ive had an ongoing problem for a year that ive tried to solve and let it run its course, and i get nothing xcept STRESS RELAXATION. stress my ass, i dont know what stress is. ive never been stressed in my life. i dont have a job. i dont care about school. i dont fight with my friends. everything is handed to me. im one lucky fucker cursed with an annoying problem. im very against medications - even for the common cold, i say let it run its course. but just this ONCE i want some FUCKING DRUGS!!1211!!</P>
<P>i <STRONG>dont </STRONG>want any of your <STRONG>god rants</STRONG> - sure he cant help me asap and all the time and blah blah. he cant help me asap because he doesnt exsist. when your problem is cured, its not cos of him, its cos your problem ran its natural course. god can suck my fucking cock.</P>
<P>on <STRONG>another note</STRONG>, marc and i saw <U>without a paddle</U> tonite. he is too cute all the time. he laughed so hard. makes me too happy. i hate to not be with him, cos then i go on rants like that one. he is all i want and all i need. i cant wait to move to be closer to him. my life is complete - once the doctor fixes me. kthxbi.</P>"

<P>tho i feel kinda gay <STRONG>staying here in maryland</STRONG>, but im not ready to leave yet. i need to watch my friends excel in their music careers. i need to watch my boyfriend graduate. i need to watch my best friend find a career shes interested in. i need to see my younger friends grow into beautiful women who will take over the world. </P>
<P>i devised a <STRONG>plan</STRONG> - i will get a <STRONG>job</STRONG>. and save every last penny. that way in like a year or so, i can get myself a nice place and not have to struggle. cos my <STRONG>dad</STRONG> definitly gets on my nerves. i need to get out asap. plus im 18, its what ive been waitin for all my life - to get out on my own. i need to start my journey like everyone else going away to a university. </P>
<P>i don't know what will become of <STRONG>marc</STRONG> and i. i know you hear it all the time - <EM>oh were totally in love and think the same about it blah blah.</EM> ive been in that kind of situation a few times, but you can always tell when the guy is shaky and just feeding you lines. this time its real, because we are so much alike its not even funny. i know im only 18 and this couldnt last forever - but you never know. i want to prove everyone wrong, and mostly myself. that something really can last forever. if it were to end, it would be the end of me. he thinks itll end over something we cant control - like moving. why am i thinking about the end in the first place? i think too much. prolly because ive been waiting for this all of my highschool career. if <STRONG>christina woody</STRONG> and <STRONG>josh tippitt</STRONG> can do it, i can do it. if <STRONG>cory matthews</STRONG> and <STRONG>topanga lawrence</STRONG>&nbsp;can do it, i can do it. i wish i had a <STRONG>mr feeny</STRONG> to say goodbye too. at least i have a <STRONG>sean</STRONG> and an <STRONG>eric</STRONG>, who will ALWAYS be with me. my incoherient ramblings are the best. </P>
<P>i tried to sign up for <STRONG>college</STRONG> today...all the classes were full, and i tested into lower shit that doesnt even count for college credit&nbsp;- gay. im starting to think <STRONG>journalism</STRONG> is my dream - but i want money, and im no good in english class, i just like to rant. its hard to balance out good money and a job you like. <STRONG>computers</STRONG> is definitely something im good at, i just hope its what i REALLY enjoy. i wish i had more time to explore. i thought about <STRONG>criminal justice</STRONG> too. im just no good at school. </P>

"event","im at kristins right now. waiting for her to get out of the shower. we stayed up til 5 am watching movies. the dreamers is really fuckin weird. the weekend was spent with my boy toy, it was ever so sweet. we connect on every level. kristin dyed and cut my hair, pictures soon. carroll county is home. its impossible to find nething in rockville, drove for an hour and never found burger king. plus no one can speak english there. i had to take the college entry exam at 8 in the morning. its just like high school, same stereotypes of people. gay. i want out. im done with this ramble."

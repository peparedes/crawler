"event","<strong><font color=""#cc0000"">So I got to my&nbsp;class around 11:30 this morning. Class wasnt supposed to start til 11:45 but ended up being later at around 12:20 PM. It started off by me answering a survey thing about alcohol, drugs,&nbsp;family, and cigarettes. Dont ask what half of that has to do with dui, Im unsure.&nbsp;by the way, the big drug&nbsp;test??? THAT WAS IT! IT WAS A DAMN PAPER THAT YOU FILLED IN THE CIRCLES ABOUT DRUGS YOU HAVE DONE IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS! NO PISS TEST, NO SWAB TEST, NO NOTHING, IT WAS ALL ON PAPER! I couldnt believe it. I could have&nbsp;smoked my mary jane, and not had to deal with all this horrible back pain. I was so mad.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyways so we had 3 speakers talk to us, A popo officer, a coroner, and the mothers against drunk driving. ( go figure )&nbsp;&nbsp;I will skip the popo, he was nice, and we just talked about what happened to us, and he told us some stories. ( he was really cool and nice ) The mothers against drunk driving were vengeful bitches if I do say so myself. I will skip those to and move on to the traumatizing part.&nbsp;<br /><br />So remember who I said the second visitor was? The coroner, yes, the people who determine time of death, and how they died. She told us some stories, and stuff, you know the usual about how bad drinking and driving was, and all that good stuff. I dont think any of us was prepared for our assignment we had to do, Yes it was manditory and you couldnt get out of it! So she says, Okay its time to take a little trip upstairs, We are going to the morgue!&nbsp; EVERYONE GOT QUIET AND LOOKED LIKE THEY SEEN A GHOST! WHAT?!?! HALF OF US SAID???? So we walk out of the class room, and into the hallway towards the elevator. i didnt even know there was a morgue in that building. We arrived upstairs and made the walk down the long hallway towards the double doors at the end. We all smelled the smell when we walked through those doors, The coroner lady says, do you smell that??? That is the smell of death, OMG it was horrible, I couldn't take it, it was the most fucked up smell you could ever smell, and it will stick with you! You will never forget that smell, ever, ever, ever! So we walk down this little hallway again and pass a office desk thing almost like a office but not all enclosed, and at the very end was a door, a freezer door, and she opened it and had everyone walk in. OH IT WAS HORRIBLE! BODIES, BODY BAGS, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, EVERYONE WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND WANTED OUT! THE SMELL, EVEN MORE TERRIBLE, I COULD NEVER DEAL WITH THAT! EVER! We was told what the difference between the blue and black body bags were. The blue was for people that died with no trauma, such as heart attack, natural causes, cancer, stuff of that nature, The black was for people mangled in car wrecks, murdered, Cut to peices, burned in fires, all of that. I am glad they did not make us look at the people in the black bags, she said it was way to gory and would not make us look. The guy in the black one was basically in pieces she claimed. I THOUGHT ID DIE! Finally she closed the damn door and we walked down the hallway to our right. Towards the autopsy room, We had to peek in the door, I will not even talk about that, Its my choice and I am not going to talk about it. Anyways after all of that, finally we got to go back down stairs, we all needed a cigarette by then, as even though we was downstairs we could still smell, the smell of death, it was very unpleasant! Finally the coroner left and the mothers against drunk driving came in, told stories, and basically made us feel like skum of the earth, saying how she bets we all thought the morgue was cool. BULLSHIT!!!!!!!! NOT ONE PERSON IN THERE LIKED IT, THE TOUGHEST OF GUYS WANTED OUT, EVERYONE DID!&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally after the MADD ladys kept bitching, we where able to leave. I was never so glad to get out of somewhere, after all of that morgue stuff. The most fucked up thing is I swear to God I can still fucking smell that death smell, even now,at my home, It is 7:04, It has been exactly 4 hours since I had to smell./ look at those bodies, I remember looking at the clock and it was 3:04 while we was up there. I can still smell the smell, 4 hours later, It is fucked up! I dont even know how I am going to go to bed tonight, Smelling that smell. I ate, and I swear I thought I was going to be sick and not be able to finish because I could still smell it. I am telling you, you will never forget that smell. NEVER!!!<br /><br />Oh I do have some good news, I got an offer from my prosecutor today! He said if I could help set up this memorial for this person killed by a drunk driver, That I could do that, and not have to do community service!!! HELL YEAH. I AM DOING THAT, So now I dont have to work all those hours with no pay! I am happy about that. I do that on december third, at the executive Inn, Have to be there by 4:00 PM, and plan to stay through 9:00. Yes I have to attend the memorial too, but hell, NO COMMUNITY SERVICE!!!!<br /><br />So that is my day, Smelling death, looking at dead people, Getting bitched at by MADD MOTHERS, and basically thats it. EXCITING HUH? GOD I CAN STILL SMELL IT!!!!!!!</font></strong>"

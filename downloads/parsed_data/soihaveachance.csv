I havnt had any tests yet and that might be why I'm so happy. I forgot to give my ID badge for work back so i did that today. I took my sister to great lakes crossing cause its right by it.

"event","I've been trying to trane the dogs how to not crap in the house. The first day there were 2 craps outside, 3 pees outside and one crap inside. I would call this a success but I think that they need just a little more persuation.

Yesterday was fun. I'm not going to say that everyone got along but it was an improvment. My older sister came over and dad, mom, sis and I played monopoly. I wish i could say it was all fun and games but I take monopoly too seriously to have fun. Its all about the right to talk smack before and after the game, during is all buisness. I won. I had a horrible time getting property but landed on free parking about three times. I had the most money by far and was able to build quickly. It was a nice win but my sister liked to hurt my feelings by laughing at my proposed trades. Later she excepted them once she realized that they were her only hope. I'm not sure if I should play anymore because it can't be good for my health. Maybe if I tryed to loose and then I wouldn't feel so much presure. 

My dog just punched me. I don't think thats ever happend before.

My epic battles with my mom are continuing. She has been extremly deffensive lately. I think that I need to start working on her to make her feel better but I'm not sure how to go about that.

Have a good one."

"event","I figured out that my personallity changes dramaticly during the day. It has to do something with my energy level or who im with.  Theres this crazy guy at work and he makes me act crazy and with my sisters friends i feel hyper. the rest of the time i feel like i have no energy and cant talk about the stuff that doesnt matter but is so fun to talk about. Im not sure if ive said this but there is nothing to talk about so im trying to talk about nothing. haha it seems like i can never talk about the things that are in the focal point of my life. its like i orbit around the important things. wouldnt it be nice to just say everything that you feel. I just wachted the ring 2. im not sure if it was good because it was scary or if it was the hot woman that made it good. oh i learned a way to tell the quality of the craftmanship of a car. you look at the edge where the roof meets the doors/doorframe. there will be a ""honda strip"" if its a cheap car or it will appear to be one stamping if it is more expensive. they ~weld the two pieces together by the roof and the quarter panel. Its going to be my new hobby to check these things out. Cadalac sts's have this honda strip so im questioning its quality. the chrysler pasifica has great blending of the honda strip into the luggage rack. This is only possible in an suv height vehicle. the saturn ion embrases the honda strip by using it as an ancent. Check it out you will have a chuckle. I think that i might apply for the fasfa. i tryed earlyer but the website was crazy and im not sure what went wrong. ive heard that parents are supposed to pay for 5.something % of their child's college. so i guess that i should have a lot of money coming because the government owes me college expenses - the 5%. Thanks for listening."

Im about to go to church. last night i watched um i forget the name but it was this movie about this guy that went crazy and started shooting people. he went to a fast food place and wanted breakfast and they say no its lunch time. so he pulls out a gun and demands breakfast but then changes his mind and gets lunch. it was more funny than anything.

"event","so the other day we got a trampoline and put it up. those things are hard to do. i made my first flip. it was a lot of pressure but somehow i did it. i left my wallet and a camera out in the rain and found them this morning. 

the other day i wrote down my priorities maybe i allready said that but i think that it might help a little. at first i thought that it would solve everything but it didnt. 

my pay check got bigger from the last one so im not sure what happened there. but i think that its a good thing. 

Last week was not bad at work. the boss being gone and all really helped. We had a pizza party and it was fun. it felt like high school when all of us were looking for seats. hoberg sat by me so that made things fun. hes the funniest guy at dow. there is orange mold growing in the multch at dow. it looks like grated cheese. 

Last night was funny when christine got in her ""bed"" and we were still watching tv. she would only watch when mister twig came up. south part is the best. not neccessarily because of the funnyness but the wittyness and relevance to issues going on in the world. 

my driving has been much better recently. i go like 65 most of the time on the expressway. and through holly i drive real slow. no ones passed me yet which is a little sad. 

i lissened to some garden state and it made me want to drive nice. but then i just couldnt take the mellow music and had to turn to 89x. out of kelly dave and chuck the freak i think dave is the funniest. they put on a good show in the morning. i think its better than bob and tom. the other day they were talking about kinky stuff to do in bed and this one lady called in and said that hes had guys shuve needles through their penis and like it. it sounded kind of sad.

ive been trying to help my mom with the computer and its makes me go crazy. the other day she was eating a cookie and talking to me and i couldnt take it. it was like nails on a chalk board. i involintarily started shaking. i guess im not the only one it bothers because christine and jen dont like it either.

i read a story about samson and he seemed like a jackass. good people in the bible arnt supposed to go around killing people. but dalila was a bitch. 

im waiting for jen to get ready so that we can go over to the grandparents but she is taking a long time. shes drying her hair and all that.

So so some bad things happen, if you really have low selfesteem then you shouldnt care enough about your self to care if your life sucks. Wow, so i guess that makes things twice as good just looking at it like that. I suppose that things are good. I think that im not going to be materialistic. Some things are good if they make you happy. That whole concept brings up the feeling of an obligation to be happy and what if  you dont feel like it. I used to want a nice car but now i want a four wheeler or a boat. I guess a four wheeler is cheaper so i think that will be the first step. oh well."

I need to start writing those things down. Ive been thinking about cars a lot lately. Mine isn't doing the best now. When I drive over 70 the tires start vibrating. I think that I need to get them balanced and allined. It might have been that curb that I hit when it was raining that caused it. Thats the thing that I like about crappy cars you can run them into curbs. Well now that i think about it I'm not too much more careful when driving my moms car. I found myself watching notebook again. I was flipping throught the channels and there it was. I played monopoly with my sisters and my brother inlaw. It was a long game. We played until 1 in the morning. I won which was cool. I have to say that in this case it was mostly luck. I ended up having all the money in the game. I think my sister got mad cause she really likes monopoly. Jen showed me this funny thing on the internet last nite. It was so funny that my stomach started hurting. I saw fantastic four with Liz. I didn't like the sience behind the plot. As a christian i dont believe that there was some cosmic storm that created life, so that was a little disapointing. The action took a long time to develop but once it got going it was good. The guy from nip tuck made a good bad guy. Well i feel like my wrists are going to explode so i guess thats it."

"event","Hi journal. Is life better being a bitch or a slut. If life is a bitch than i want a piece of that. I keep trying to figure out if i should be happy that life isnt fun or find out that life is fun. Ok enough pouting. I started work today. It went fast so i suppose that that is a good sign. Well this is not that fun when no one talks back."

"event","I'm in Oakland. No, not Oakland county Oakland California. I've always wanted to go out west so now my traveling career is complete. The mountains are great out here. They don't seem to be as tall as the Alps but there seems to be more of them. I got to climb a little of one and the air seemed really thin. On one hand it was easy to breathe but I had to breathe more to get enough oxygen. Wow that sounded really stupid. Well like most Burger vacations we have done more arguing than having fun. I think that experience vacations need to be used in moderation. Maybe 2 fun vacations for every 1 experience vacations. Living with mom is a good way to learn to have patience in talking to people. It sometimes is hard to stay under control. Backtalk is not an option even if the other person may deserve some. I hope that I have learned some respect. I still have a long way to go on thinking about other peoples feelings. I've had a idea that it is impossible to be truly selfless. One might think that they are but they have their motives. Some motives are for better things like getting to heaven but some are more devious like having you actions reciprocated."

"event","hey this is my first entry. i dont know how it works. ive noticed that the people that read these things like talking about emotion, which isnt my thing, so i will try. I have been learning some things in my humanities class. The biggest message is that if you think you know everything, you are admitting that you dont have a grasp on anything as reasoned by proof by contradiction. As you go through your chain of thoughts you realize that you come to a point that disproves your whole argument. That is the most conclusive why to show that someone is full of it. On a positive note if you are striving to make yourself better than you are a virtuous person. But what is virtue...temperance perhaps. Yes i think that this is the most lacked virtue of all. is it better to lack fault and virtue or have both. mmm i like that one. would you want to be the person that doesnt do anything in fear of doing something wrong or do some right and some wrong. haha like the guilty going free or innocent to imprisonment. well the concept of benefit to society comes up. is that the greater good? is the right thing the thing that is best for the most number of people? Now for me, im the fearful. i strive to do better but play it safe. yeah some of you remember the play it safe speech a gave. as people laughed i realize how ridiculous it is. maybe mistakes arent that bad. maybe you cant learn for others mistakes. One might think that there is no such thing as sin. wait just a second. well if you knew that you were going to sin then you must have been ignorant. why would you do something deliberately in this life that would reap such consequences in the next. well ist kind of like constant velocity...no force but movement, just doesnt make sense."

I love Ryan with all of my heart no doubt but we are always in a fight and I just dont know how to deal with this. Plus I do like josh and I want things to work out but I am not gonna have a boyfriend for a while until I know if I am gonna take Ryan back or not and then even longer after that because if I dont take him back then I have to give me and him both time to get over each other. Gosh I just dont know what to do I mean I love him I really do I just dont know if we need to be together. We still talk all of the time and we will still be friends but I dont know if I can handle to see him with someone else that is why I think that part of me still wants to be with him, the other part of me thinks that we argue so much that we make each other miserable. It is like we want this to work so much that we put so much effort into it and then it doesnt ever work! One of us is always unhappy! Well I am gonna go for now because all this talk of Ryan is making me want to cry!

Me and Ryan broke up and I am so upset I feel like all I was put on the earth to do is make mistakes the only thing I think I have ever done right is get Ryan to be a part of my life and have the friends that I have like Kara and Brittany. Ryan means so much to me and well I hate being me without him! It is really hard! Well, I went to his house today and we talked a little bit about some stuff and then I dont know why but I guess that he realized that I really love him and want him to be a part of my life and he reached out and started to run his fingers through my hair then he grabbed my hand and of course I couldnt hold back the tears. I havent really slept in like three weeks. I keep having this same dream over and over. Me and Ryan are sitting in his room and he is looking at me and he just grabbs my hand and then starts to hold me and then I usually wake up...but today he did this and I just kept wanting to pinch myself and make sure it wasnt another dream. I was the happiest person alive! I really hope that we work out I love him so much! He means the world to me! I would do anything for him! Well I am gonna go to bed I am tired and tonight I cant wait to get to sleep so I can see his face. Night!

My head is spinning an I just I dont know I cant even fucking think and I am in a thinking mode! I cant quit thinking about how bad I hurt Ryan and I cant quit thinking about all kinds of things! stupid shit I guess like when Ryan ask me why I did the things I did and I dont have an answer for him I know exactly how bad it hurts to not have an answer for the most important questions because...My dad...well He left home when I was like four ever since then he has never been there and has always promised me things and never given them to me and when I ask him why he left what the hell is going wrong the only answer that I get is I dont know and that makes me think its my faught because I am such a big Fuck-up...why not just fuck one more thing up? Then I wonder what I would have felt like if I got ridiculed and snareled at everytime I was seen walking with the person who cheated on me if I were in his shoes? 
What the fuck? How could I have been so fucking stupid? How could I do that to someone I love soooo much? HOW? These are the questions that Ryan wants answered and funny thing is I want them answered too because I dont have a fucking clue! I dont know what the Fuck was running through my head! Why the fuck I did it I just know that it was so wrong and I am sooo sorry! 
Fahren is such a good friend for understanding and taking this so well!She and Kara are the two BEST girl friends I have and Kaitlyn is right there with them!

Ryan and Me had the whole day together pretty much because he and I sold candy and got to go to the carnival! We hugged each other and kissed each other it was great!

"event","I am in the bitchiest mood ever I dont understand how I can let people get to me so bad today my sister said that I was an ugly whore I dont know where the hell she got that shit from but she needs to go on with it! She gets everything she wants and more and when she is a bitch to me its OKAY but if I am even smart with her I get yelled at! 
     Ryan told me today that he wasnt mad at me and after I wrote that entry last night he called and said he was sorry that he hasnt talked to me much he hasnt been in the mood to talk on the phone. Then we had this sweet little conversation about how we first met and started going out!
     We met on the school bus when I was in the seventh grade! He liked my x-friend Tiffini Smith and I tryed to hook them up and well that lasted about what? Three months max! Then he told his x-best friend Connor Housch to ask me if I liked him and I said yes and the rest is history! Well I am about to bounce cuz I am going to my game!

"event","I am so frustrated with everything, I dont understand it feels like nothing I do is right enough for my mom! I make all b's on my progress report and she tells me to bring them up! AHHHH, I wish just for one day she would look at me and see that I am doing the BEST I can do! Ryan called me today and told me how beautiful I was wich made me a little better! He always knows just what to do or say to make me smile! Kevin today was bugging me sooo bad! He would not shut-up about wanting to screw Kara and hes already got a girlfriend and on top of that he tried to tell me that I dont love Ryan and he has NO PLACE in me and Ryans relationship and I am so sick of ppl being so negative why cant they let me love him without sayin your to young to know what love it or he dont love you he dont care! That kinda stuff makes me so freekin depressed he needs to stay the hell outta my friken business! AHHH!!! Well I feel a lot better now because I got all this off my shoulders so thanx well anyways HAPPY BIRTHDAY KARA!!! Sorry I couldnt call I had things to do for my mom because of her dui thingy

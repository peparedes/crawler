came home and helped make dinner and then slept becauseiamsooooooootiiiiired. i keep staying up until, like, 2:00 bajillion in the morning. and then i wake up and are all AAAAAAARRRRRR CRAAAAANE-KEY and sleepy. and math was lame because kayli made fun of me for crying at king kong, even though she cries at denzel washington movies. and michael and matt wripped the head off of the owl, and now it doesn't bobble like it used to. and the lord of the flies moving was depressing, bwaaaaaaa....

and pretty much all i've done is play harvest moon and watch netflix dvds and sleep. today was semi-productive. hopped on over to the neighbors to check up with them about watching their cats, and then came back home and cleaned part of the kitchen. tried to burn dvds. didn't work.

today was kinda boring. i failed the math test. i'm so sure. and there was no one to talk to during VA. and hockhalter is lame for making us get into ""reading groups."" wouldn't people feel better about talking about ""controversial issues"" with people they know? just a thought. doesn't really matter. so far, all the people in our group feel the same way, even if anna doesn't pay attention."

so i went home and downed a handful of pills, watched ""blue collar comedy tour"" and a six hour tape of the ""simpsons tree house of horror."" blue collar comedy is hilarious. fershure. it's one of the only things on TV that makes me bust up laughing without even trying.

slept for a couple of hours, then mum and dad and anna came home, and dad made chicken noodle soup. yay for soup.

went to graphic design and got alot done. unfortunately, about halfway through, my vision went all blurry and  everything was all blurry at the edges, and my head felt fuzzy. i lost my graphite and couldn't find it. i swear. it just disappeared. but oh well. lori and i have the ebst time listening to middle schooler's conversations. they're so ridiculous.

spent lunch moaning about how horrid i felt. i called dad to try and go home, but he didn't pick up the phone, so i decided to tough it out. spent the rest of lunch hanging out with the dark side. spent advo doing PDP stuff.

vocal was alot of fun. we're singing a song from the phantom of the opera, and it's very pretty. again, i got full points, which was fun, even though he didn't add on sub-conversation points. lots of fun.

science was spent playing cards and arguing over <strike>mao</strike> <strike>mow</strike> <strike>aioausoaioojjaskdf</strike> that game that people argue over. jeff gave me a backrub, which was nice of him, and gave me some ibuprofen to help with my headache. <3 so person of the day award goes to jeff, for being nice.

dinner theater was awesome. so awesome. we started off the evening with pizza, and drawing on the paper on the table. during intermission, sarah faulkner caused quite a commotion when she smooshed a cupcake into my face. i rebuked, and she fell out of her chair; and into more frosting. i was also attacked by many children who wanted their pictures drawn. the waiters were awesome.

well, the day wasn't so interesting. science was fun. and so was graphic design.
don't you love it when someone you don't really know compliments you?
i think it's just nice.

so after school i went with some of the mabelgreys, and a few of the newly innitiated mabelgreys, and went to elan's house to watch ferris bueller's day off, and i'd already said i'd make spaghetti. but we decided we wanted drinks and bread and salad, so we walked to safeway to buy stuff with, like, $13, plus the $2 maya was hiding. we got catcalled at by a big group of guys playing football in some field we passed. we bought our stuff, along with a box of samoas from some girl scouts, who were cute and adorable. we walked back, got catcalled again, and went to elans house.

may i mention that elan has a very narrow kitchen, especially for six or seven people who really don't know what they're doing.

but dinner ended up really really good. i made spaghetti and sauce w/ meatballs, moody and maya made salad and dressing, anna and nicole fixed the bread (which smelled fantastic) and elan made coconut-strawberry things, that were meant to be mixed with rum, but we didn't. so we ate a dinner prepared totally by the mabelgreys, and watched ferris bueller's day off, which is a great movie.

it was alot of fun.
oh yeah, randomly learned that jeff lives near me, so we spent about a half hour in science trying to figure out exactly how far apart our houses are. so i ended up taking too long on my concept maps.
concept maps are a pain."

"event","general recap:

graphic design: fun. listened to music. theodore moosed me twice in the same five minutes. flopped.

lunch: went and hid with, like, tons of people in 105 to surprise winkley and peterson for their birthday. got cake and cheesecake, and wrote on their card. which was the wall. also had to fight matt for cake, but lost, but got a middle piece anyway.

vocal: i love vocal. it's so fun. and the altos rock, even though the sopranos suck. because. they suck.

science: made necklaces with string that smelled like goat. got confused, but then was a necklace making beast got moosed two or three more times. flopped.

FQs suck. i don't think i've ever just wanted to not do something so much in my life.

after school: mom and dad were still at work, so we made dinner by ourselves. we made spaghetti, although there was argument over whether we would have corn bread or garlic bread. it ended up with us tangled up on the kitchen floor screaming:

""MAKE ME CORN BREAD!"" 
""CORN BREAD DOESN'T GO WITH SPAGHETTI!!!""

somehow, whenever we're in the kitchen together, we end up fighting over food.
and also arguments going along the lines of:

""dude, anna, i called dibs on shaun white.""
""you didn't. dibs don't count.""
""doesn't matter. he's my boyfriend.""

because. well. he is. he's my boyfriend."

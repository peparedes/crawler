"event","This journal is about the chicken shit that is to scared to come out and say who the fuck he/she is, I'm pretty sure that it isnt a female because most females have the intellegence to hate the word CUNT! so when you come on here trying to call me some slanged word for something that i love it isnt really offensive. Quite funny if you ask me.. It's pathetic how you think you are so superior to anyone else.. like you happen to know everything, but you DON'T, you know shit about anything.. 
From the feeling of things just the way you act and talk youu couild be quite easily related to someone who lives in the gutters that's where your mouth belongs and that is where your childish acts belong.. go back to the playground you fuckwit the monkey bars are waiting for you and take your SKANK gf with you... whoops did i just say skank yes i think it was... and i dont think thta i meant that lightly, there was quite alot of force behind that..  

I sick of listening to your chicken ass shit... I am still to see you come out of that little shell that you are hiding behind.. although im pretty sure i know who this is like bf  like gf right??.. you just can't get over things, you just can't grow up right???? Nar that aint a question it should be a statement.. You come on here saying how lots of people would like to see me dead.. lots is more than 2 a couple is two you uneducated delinquent.. but i guess you should have known that seeming you are so fucking smart and all... 
I can comment where i want and when i want.. You can't tell me what to do.. you can sit there and try mean while i will just sit there and laugh my fucking face off at you, try to be all marcho when really your just acting like a person with the intellence of a two year old trying to pick fights chasing people all around the joint.. making pathetic threats that just turn out to be quite humourous, because i and everybody else knows that you dont have the guts or the facts to back anything up, everything you know is all hearsay and it's complete bullshit passed from person to person.. like chinese whispers but you know what it never turns out the way it left off.. NEVER!...  after all your still hiding behind the internet as anonymous.. like just being on the net wasn't going to hide you anyways.. but you have to be an extra chicken shit and hide behind a mask... 

Secondly you come on here after retrieveing information from jan and think that you know what the fuck you are talking about, but when the truth is for one second you couldnt even comprehend what the fuck you are talking about... Your facts are both fucked and bias... and you wouldnt even understand what the fuck your were talking about even if someone sat down and tried to teach you as though you were a grade 1er... so before you come on here ranting and raving that your all that, Take a fucking look at yourself.. you are the one that is fucking whinging like a baby... 

Take your fucking long ass girly hair.. and walk your ass away like the fucking girl that you are... You can try to act as tough as you want, but the truth is everyone of my friends are laughing at you.. 
Plus i dont feel like getting renee pregnant that would just be stupid, i love her more than the world but it just aint gunna happen yet! i sill have alot shit to do before i would do that, why dont you go and ignore your gf when she is trying to tell you that she might be having a miscarriage... but i dont know.. I dont use shit that i dont know nothing about!"

"event","I was sitting there And i was Well gettign on with my work organising myself to be ready for my english assignment that is due on wednesday... Organising all this shit for the video tape when Ms. Galvin calls me over.. ""Lee, lee, what is this racial crap? I find this very offensive."" Oh How i would have liked to smack the living fuck outta her that time.. Normally Ms galvin is a Good teacher... But today, she can seriously go and shove her fucked up views up her ass.. She sits me down and says "" Where are you going with this? What are you trying to say, all i see is that you are being racist and offensive. not getting their true politcal feelings out into the open."" well i think i do.. "" look lee, i am your english teacher sitting here and i am telling you that you have to change you assignment if you dont and get up infront of the class and say your oral.. you could find youself expelled or suspended""

You told me that we have to do a persausive speech showing a groups aspect on something, and that is what i did, it is suppose to be fucking offensive... "" oi watch you langauge young man""  Sorry miss, But that is the way that they view things, ""dont but me!"" But it is, "" I suggest that you dont do skinheads, it would be in your benefit if you didn't"" Yeah whatever Ms. Im staying with the Skinheads, ""Ok your choice but you would be smart to tone it down, ALOT!""  

So now here i am sitting well here having to face the fact that i have moral delemers, Write a completly new 10 minute oral or to tone it down so that no one can find it offensive... either way it is due on Wednesday and this fucking bitch thinks that i will have it ready i think not stupid bum ill see you in Hell... hahah it aint real!. Perhaps i should get up there and read what i have already written, then we will see if she like it aye.. If i was to see myself expelled over something so stupid. i would crack go on a rampage and destroy anything io could get my hands on in this school.. Spray Paint for all how to make this school shit
oh it already is what the fuck was i thinking??"

"event","Skinheads have never been given a a fair chance, from day one we have been crucified by todays society, the media, music companies and clubs. Skinheads, todays working class are crucified because of our beliefs, We show this by tattooing the picture of a skinhead being crucified on a cross. Since Our origin skinheads have been typically stereotyped as being NAZIS or Neo-NAZIS, yes some of us are Neo-NAZIS but we would prefer to be called White Beret or simply Skinheads.

The Movement began in England in the late 1960's, it became a fashion Statement among young white factory workers to shave their heads and because they were required to have their hair short anyway so that it didn't get caught in the machinery. When the racial, social and economical conditions Deteriorated, the immigrants began to over run the English Factories taking white jobs, thus it came time for us to retaliate, beating up any and all non-whites. The shaved heads are no longer a fashion statement, over time it has become a large part of our subculture, not only does it represent our very name of being a skinhead, but in a fight the advantage is already ours as we don't need to worry about having our hair pulled out.

Love and Hate go hand in hand, skinheads sometimes can be seen with love tattooed on the knuckles of their Left hand and hate on the Right. Put it like this, If you love your family then it is a natural instinct that you hate anyone that would attempt to threaten your family, so if you see it like that then Jews and blacks alike, the parasites of society are a direct threat to the white race over running us stealing our jobs it is expectable that we would hate something that makes threats to our existence. If the wish to stay in Israel or Africa then so be it, instead they wish to live in a white race controled land and try to take over what we have spent so long creating. It is ok to be black and Proud!!!, or Jewish and Proud, but the moment that you become white and Proud you are frowned upon as a Bigot, a NAZI, a Racist, a fascist or a skinhead."

When you spend way too much time with people you fuck up their brain, heart and liver. However, after spending a wopping wonderful night with you, the next day people get deppressed thinking of you and how much they miss you. They get love sick and dont want to eat, they cant sleep, they feel sore in their muscels and cant concentrate for very long as they dream of when they will spend an exhilarating time with you again on the dance floor at the very next rave party.

WEll i am bored so i thought that i would write this stupid little journal... pretty much telling people nothing about what i want to sya or anything about what i dont.. so you know.. some would say that i have gone crazy well not really i am just really really shitty and if you dont like it go and explain it to my mum because she is being an utter bitch ..you know hwat i mean... Did you know that school is just one repetitive day after the other just telling us something once again that we dont need to know just like the pointless facts of Algebra, now come on no one can honestly tell me that any of this shit will ever be used in my life... I sit there nad pretty much the only thing i will ever need to know is how to do my 9 times tables and yerah  that is the easiest piece of shit.. so what is the point of fucked up formula's im not trying to be a fucking rocket scientist you know i dont need to know what type of angle a road should curve at so that the cars wont slip off when they are going around the road... Geezus..!!!

Have you ever wondered where your life is taking you?? ok ok very stupid question!... everyone does it neally very day they sit there and go Fuck what am i going to dpo whne i leave school, grade oners on their first day, are little Lee what wouild you lijek to be when you grow up....  "" Ms i wanna be a Giggilo on rodeo Drive""... Or "" yo yo Wazzup bitch, Im gunna be a Famous Rapppppp-er"".. 
BUt yeah you all get my point it's strange to see where life has taken you.. it's ups and downs the fucking pot holes in the road that could sink into.... and those hills that if you pick up enough speed you could at least for a second believe that you are flying ( ok perhaps not in my car Speed im sorry what is speed i dont believe i have ever heard that word Speed and Mightyboy just dont match)
But again im just getting off the beaten treck the point is i dont know there are a few things that i am definate about my relationship for one, IM sticking by this girl no matter what she makes my world and without her there would be none... 

To be Continued!

SO there i was sitting there bored to the complete shithouse.. oh hang on wrong story that was just my day repeating in my mind again.. i reacon i could just sleep for the rest of the year and dream about the same day going over and over again and it'd still feel like i was at school becuase the same thing would just keep happening in my dream.. I know it's a stupid idealistic way of seeing things but you know what! I dont care!!! coz all it is me crapping on about the same old shit.. So what does that mean the person that hates repitition is suffering a bad dose of Repition himself... repeating the same word over and over and over....

did you know what I need a serious drink... glug glug, oh i can imagine it now the fluid passing down my throat!!! Yummy Drink Yummy Drink i should go to my car and get some money to purchase a drink but taht all seems to much trouble for one measley Fucking drink or maybe it is not?? who knows not me??? I think i have gone a Tad crazy time for me to Go byez Byez...

From this day on, the fourth day of July will no longer be remembered as an American holiday but as the day that all of mankind declared we will not go quietly into the night.

Yeah well I just went and sat my fucked up QCS test.. yeah well it was so fucked i can tell you that... 2 hours of Writing pure crap.. at least i got to finish lik an hour early and caught up on some much needed SHut eye.. taht i deprived myself of having last night because I am a dickhead...

But before all this something funny happened, we all had to go to our classes and shit.. and yeah well i went to class sitting there looking at the paper then the teach calls out the role... then at the end he gones anyone who isnt on the role Put you hand up.. so what do i do i put my hand up... eeeekkk and then he Goes ""Ms Swann, You arn't on my list either. Who shouldnt be here you never belonged here"" so Amy is like what OH shit... and she's like yelling in a exam ""im always here"" and shit like that.... So me and amy walk out of the room and amys like Ok were the rejects come on lets Go it was pretty funny... she closes the door and goes... ""Oh my god... SHAME!!!"" and then we went to the classes we were supose to be at.. and did the exam... it was funny so far the funniest thing of my day.... And you wanna know the worst fuckign thing.. I'm at SCHOOL..........
 
well i wrote about how people Escape from the darkness by creating light... You know taht when you are in a QCS you can write the biggest load of bullshit so long as it relates to the topic and ou ahve all your spelling and grammar and shit right you can make up as much shit as you want and start talking about aliens that attacked a rock concert... It's very Stranger if you ask.. me... I dont know I think im a bit wierd... Oh wells BRB.... OOK Back..>

now i am very dissapointed i just went to the library chick to see if i could get a video camera for the weekend and they are all gone... Arrrrrrrrr...... Whoz shitty nnowz??? Lee is.... hehhe well i now have till Monday to have my oral in... and yeah that is good shit so i can do some work on it during the weekend, two days without eNGLISH.... Oh happy day, Oh happy day.. So here i am sitting in te library being a Geek writing this fucked up journal, while nay's best friend sheriee Harvey is beside me....

BUt i dont really know. it's strange to think... but yeah oh wells it's not really a big deal... 

SO what my point was this day is a good day and no matter what nothing can ruin it, not even a Bad Chicken burger, even though that can make me a bit shitty, i can always think hey.. It's been four months... well anyways All i wanted to say is that I love yo baby, and im glad that you are in my life.. and i always want you to be in it.. Love forever your Boy....

""Well i never thought they were there for that i can promise you that""... Never used to do everything with liam.. and yet me and him are pretty much brothers he has always been there for me when i needed him (aprat from my b'day bastard forgot)...

I'm sorry if you can't see the fact that not everything in life comes on a silver platter.. I have always been there for thr people that have wanted me really to just because i dont spend every second with them doesnt mean that we fight saying that i never there for you coz the truth is i am... Liam and i live what seems like a million miles away but if push came to shove i would be there for him if he really really needed me.

Correcting the things that you hadn't dont and making the things that you had better than what they were. 

But Would you really wanna hit that reset button. Perhaps life is not a game of chance of skill but just a Stupid Game on Follow the leader, where you hit that try again button and the game still end up finishing the same way as it did before. you still end up dieing.. sure you may have changed a few things making it easier to live, but because of this there has been things that you would not have otherwise experienced... And those things maybe the best things in life that you are missing out on.. everything has it's consequences.. Whether they be minor or something Gigantic.. but everything works out for a purpose...

I have failed MAths B for the 5th term.. When you like hear this you'll be like ""WOW i dont believe"" {ok only me and nay will get that one}... 
Well as you should have realised the fact that im not as smart as everyone tries to tell themselve. if fact it's the complete opposite and i feel like i have let everyone down my parents my friends.. everyone.. 

It doesnt really bother me that much apart from the fact that i didnt really live up to my parents expectations.. i have alwasy really known that i wasn't this budding child prodogy.. yet my parents always used to think lee your so smart you and your big brother... but he really didnt put his mind to his studies.. lee you can be anythign you want to be if you put your mind to it... 

Yeah well i would have thought taht but putting my mind to it hurts my damn head.. it's like Wow i don believe.. Hehehhe I had to throw that one in there... well i dont know where i go from here maybe it's time to leave school and get my start in the real world. before time catches up with me and smacks me in the ass.. all i know is that im staying here with my baby no matter what... SO you tend to think what will happen with my life.. at the moment it looks like im gunna be a loser for the rest of my life.. people keep saying that im smart and you start to think that ten wen it comes time that you have to prove that you are smart, and you really can't because there is not smartness there it's like a big mac truck hitting you head on like wow i don believe.. God i gotta stop saying that.. 

Hhehehehe MY name is tie mi shu.. hehehehehe.. well i think that my brain is hurting to much at the moment and if im not careful then it'll start hermaraging... ""Hey kids, I bet you thought that i was dead, but when i fell over i just broke my leg and got a hemarage in my head..""

Gota go MAths B now...  Bye


OKies now im back from the application part oof my exam Fuck it was so much fucking easier than the first fuckign paper Like Wow i don believe...

<small>As you left for work that Morn.
Did you ever expect that a tragedy would be born?,
You Caught the elevator up them somewhat endless stairs,
Only to open them hideous office doors
To the Tiresome coffe smell,
Did it ever occur to you that soon you would be struck by hell,
You wander to sit in that uncomfortable office chair
Go ahead, take a look out the window, if you dare! 
What a site to see
But could this really happen to me?
Soon you start to shake 
Somewhat like a giant Quake.
You sit there and just stare 
Then suddenly along comes the blinding Glare.
With awful pain you start to burn
Holyshit, you think, "" This can't be my turn"".
You start to Scream 
Then notice you cant like an awful dream.
You open your eyes,
The painful Tear dry's
You decided to look around,
Only to see your Staff jumping for the ground
You look for your only way out,
Still comes that terrifying scream and shout.
Suddenly you find that hideous door
Not even thinking that this could mean war.
Then you start to think of your next of Kin.
Realising that this morning you should have slept in. 
Finally you made it to those stairs
In pain, you Burnt skin continually tears
After what seemed like an hour 
You remarkable make it out of that tower
An Ambulance Officer Tells you of the story
Then that story gets even more gory.
When a plane hits the second tower
For christ Sake who would attack a Super Power.
As the Ambulance Pulls away
You wish to yourself, can't we go back, Just one day.
You here about the attack on Washington
And Want to be back with my family in Wellington
You lie there in the waiting room
All you an think of is this Amazing Boom.
You look at the damage as you listen to the president speak
And slowly your future starts to look bleak
At Eleven-forty you have your last cry
This was your turn, "" goodbye"" you say, as you die.
Who Humainly Possible could do this 
As you go through that heavenly Bliss
How many live were lost
And how much will this bloody cost
This time the president will not sit back and watch the hay,
Finally them terrorist bastards will pay.
It all happened on the 11th of September
This Truly is a day the world will remember.
Lets Take a look at this day,
And remember them Terrorist Bastards will pay.</small>

Wells some of you might disagree and say that love aint real or love can break up.. and to be honest think about it is it really love, Love is something honest anad true.. it's a mental Aphrodisiac. Andit really isnt love it if can be broken, that is my oppion on things and i am not looking for anyone elses.

"event","<font color = purple>I have come to my senses and after Popular demand i have chosen to continue my epic quest to write a journal. I have been insisted to keep writing however. by choice of my own i have deleted every journal i have ever written. And have started fresh and ready to write a journal this <font color = yellow>time not filled with useless song lyrics but stories of my life. what journals were designed for. Stories of the past and the future to become... Filled with love hatred and Passion.. 

<font color = aqua>We have been given a chance to breakfree and make what has been wrong, right. Shall we take it or stand there as the world suffers. Dont sit back and become Dosile.. For those who stand out from the rest we call them patriotic... </font>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Life Events"">Now that I have given official notice to my landlord, I can make the announcement here, which is that I have undertaken something crazy, which is that...I am building a house. 

Not me, obviously, with my own two hands, because that would truly be crazy, as I am bad at everything that requires the use of tools, but someone is building a house on my behalf for me to live in. 

The story goes like this: I have never really liked the townhouse that I live in. I had to rent it because my original landlord of the first apartment I rented here broke the lease on me and left me kind of high-and-dry and so I had to scramble and rent this place sight unseen. It has never been ideal--for one, it&#39;s too small for all of my stuff, so I have to step over piles of boxes everywhere--and the list of not-ideal about it has kept growing: There is some kind of leak in the bathrooms that somehow the plumber thinks is the result of me throwing water around pell-mell (not a thing that I do). The stove doesn&#39;t actually work properly. The hot water heater doesn&#39;t actually work properly. One day sparks flew out of the electrical outlet in the bathroom and caught my hair dryer on fire while I was using it. Et cetera. 

I am actually an INCREDIBLY picky person, as anyone who knows me knows well, and this house suits none of my pickiness. I don&#39;t like how the windows don&#39;t have screens so I can&#39;t open them (I like fresh air). I don&#39;t like how it not only doesn&#39;t have a microwave, it also doesn&#39;t have room for one. I don&#39;t like how the gas fireplace is an open flame. I don&#39;t like how the smoke alarm in the kitchen is so sensitive that to cook I have to open up all the doors (because again, no screens), even when it&#39;s below freezing outside. I don&#39;t like how the heat doesn&#39;t work right, so it&#39;s always freezing downstairs and a sauna upstairs. Et cetera. 

I am not a huge fan of the neighborhood I&#39;m in. Behind my house is a bunch of fratboys whose yard is always so gross. Sometimes I try to detail the things they have in their yard. My favorite is the ladder they have for an above-ground swimming pool...which they don&#39;t have. And sometimes they just randomly light couches on fire in the backyard. Seems safe. And my little outdoor area is RIGHT up against their yard, so that if they&#39;re out there, I can&#39;t be outside because it&#39;s awkward (probably only in my head. But still). I&#39;m on a hill, which I don&#39;t like because I can&#39;t see if cars are coming up the hill and so I freak out every time I leave the driveway. I&#39;m across from a cemetery, which also freaks me out and attracts deer who like to try to kill themselves in front of my car. There are no sidewalks around my house, which cuts down on walks, which I would really like to take. Et cetera. 

And I knew all this about this place but in my head I was like, &quot;This is temporary, this is all temporary, it&#39;s good enough.&quot; And then one day I woke up and I&#39;d been here three years and I was looking at a fourth and I was like, &quot;Why am I living my life like this?&quot; There&#39;s a lot about my life I can&#39;t change, so I therefore try to be good about the things I <i>can</i> change. I don&#39;t like where I live in a larger sense and have little control over that, but I can at least try to like my little piece of where I live. 

Oh! And I haven&#39;t even gotten into the shenanigans with the trash in this neighborhood! Right after I moved in, somebody stole my trash can. I was bewildered, like, what did this mean? I know they stole mine, because they left one behind in its wake, and it was stained with, like, bleach or something, in a way mine hadn&#39;t been, and it had all garbage in it that was not mine. So I spent a little while being like, &quot;...Has someone killed someone and left the body here in their trash can and taken my trash can instead?&quot; Not really knowing what to do (like, should I have called the police? That seemed like an overreaction???), I put the trash can out as usual. That particular trash day, I noticed that someone had put a trash can out that looked like mine, so I decided that maybe their taking of mine and leaving of theirs was some kind of weird mistake? Or something? Whatever, I took my non-stained trash can back and spray painted my address on it to deter such a thing happening again, because I don&#39;t want other people&#39;s garbage in my trash. 

Too bad that doesn&#39;t deter the people in my neighborhood. For some reason, they are OBSESSED with throwing their trash in my trash can. WHAT IS UP WITH THIS? My trash can was up the side of my house, so they had to walk up my driveway to the back of my house to do this and I&#39;m annoyed by this. I DON&#39;T WANT OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S TRASH IN MY TRASH CAN. I DON&#39;T WANT OTHER PEOPLE AT THE END OF MY DRIVEWAY, WHERE IT&#39;S DARK, LURKING AROUND NEAR MY TRASH CAN. I think that&#39;s weird. Am I weird to think that&#39;s weird? So then I took to hiding my trash can behind my fence, around the corner of my house, all the way in the back, and that does seem to deter people, thankfully. 

Trash days here are Monday and Thursday mornings. One Wednesday evening, I put out my trash can. On Thursday evening when I got home from work I went to retrieve it and it was gone. And there wasn&#39;t even a sketchy one left in its place. And I kind of decided that I&#39;d had enough of the trash shenanigans and snapped a little bit and e-mailed the city to tell them my trash can had been stolen. And here&#39;s where the story gets HILARIOUS. Because it turns out the city had confiscated my trash can! They thought it was &quot;abandoned&quot;! I was like, &quot;...Wasn&#39;t yesterday a trash day in my neighborhood? I had the trash can out because it was trash day, not because I was abandoning it.&quot; And the city was like, &quot;Yeah, our bad, sorry about that, we&#39;ll bring it back to you.&quot; And then--GUYS, THIS IS A THING THAT REALLY HAPPENED--they sent me an e-mail with a photograph attached and ASKED ME TO PICK MY TRASH CAN OUT OF A LINEUP OF TRASH CANS THEY HAD CONFISCATED. THIS WAS A THING THEY ASKED ME TO DO WITH A STRAIGHT FACE. I got this e-mail while I was sitting in the coffee shop working and I started laughing so uncontrollably that I think I alarmed people but REALLY. *REALLY.* I ended up being able to pick it out of the line-up because of the fact that I&#39;d helpfully spray painted my address on it. 

So, anyway, the trash can stuff wasn&#39;t the final straw but I am hoping my new neighborhood is less crazy about the trash stuff.

At first I thought I&#39;d just rent a nicer, slightly bigger place, but the rental market here is OUT OF CONTROL. The prices were making me laugh hysterically. I was like, &quot;I think I could buy a house and pay less money per month than these people want.&quot; And it turns out: Yeah. I could. 

So there&#39;s this development going up in a part of town I really like and I walked through it and really liked it. You can pick your own floorplan from a list and it&#39;s kind of a New-Orleans-y neighborhood with gas lamps all over the place and the neighborhood has sidewalks! I would have a gas kitchen!!!!! I haven&#39;t had a gas kitchen in SO MANY YEARS. Just that alone made me want to buy the place. So I ran all the numbers and the mortgage payment would be many hundreds of dollars less than if I kept renting and I was like, &quot;I guess. Might as well.&quot; 

I&#39;m not going into it thinking I&#39;m going to make a bunch of money off of this house, because I know real estate and in my experience, that&#39;s not how it works. I&#39;m going into it, though, thinking that it would be nice to have something to look forward to about this place. And, in that respect, it really has worked. I think about this house and I&#39;m *excited.* Like, I really want to live in it. And that&#39;s nice. And I&#39;ve been astonished by how much fun it&#39;s been to make the house *mine.* I thought I&#39;d be completely overwhelmed but it turns out when I sat down and thought about it seriously, I knew exactly what I wanted in the house. The woman who helped me pick the finishes said she was really impressed with how well I knew my own style, and I realized that I have spent literally years thinking about this. I have opinions on almost everything house-related. And what I don&#39;t have opinions on isn&#39;t because I haven&#39;t thought about it but because I <i>have</i> thought about it and genuinely don&#39;t care. So I feel like all that HGTV-watching and NBT-writing and Architectural-Digest-reading has really paid off for me. When I had to pick paint colors, the woman was like, &quot;So, let me get swatches,&quot; and I said, &quot;No, I want Benjamin Moore Cloud White on every wall and ceiling in this house,&quot; and she was like, &quot;...Wow. You *do* know what you want.&quot; And this *is* the kind of thing I don&#39;t think I would have ever been able to afford up north, so it&#39;s nice to finally feel like there&#39;s a positive to being down here, and that&#39;s that I&#39;ve gotten to have this experience of designing my own house. 

Which *has* been interesting to do down here. I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve lived in the South for a while before starting this so I can confidently assert the things that would go without saying up north but that I know are weird down here. Like, it turns out the most expensive thing in my house is my desire for the gas fireplace to be glassed in. I had never seen open-flame gas fireplaces until I moved down here and it would never have occurred to me to check to make sure it would be glassed in until I&#39;d lived here, so I&#39;m glad I checked. The woman was completely bewildered by my insistence on the glass. But, on the flipside, she was completely bewildered that I don&#39;t mind having the garbage disposal operated from a switch on the wall. She said that everybody down here pays extra to have a button put on their counter, which to me just seems weird and I don&#39;t want another thing on my counter that I have to avoid. But I saved myself some money there, I guess!

So yeah, that&#39;s my crazy news. The house is supposed to be done in six months, which will be *just* in time for the next school year to start. We&#39;re cutting it close, so I&#39;m hoping there are no weather delays. I&#39;ve only got lighting left to pick out. Actually, not true, I looked through literally thousands of lights and picked out my lighting and went to the lighting place (open M-F, 9-5, so that&#39;s super-convenient when you&#39;re working, as you can imagine) and they were like, &quot;Are you sure? Most people change their minds. Come back later.&quot; Grr. I AM SURE. I will go back again and *insist* this time on what I want. I find I&#39;m pretty good if I don&#39;t let people convince me that my taste is something different. This whole thing has been a lesson in being able to assert that I know what I like in the face of dubiousness otherwise. But I think the house is going to be very, very ME when it is done, and that might make it complicated to resell, but for now, it&#39;s been fun to spin out what that is. :-)</lj-cut>"

And it was really good. But Lin-Manuel Miranda was sick yesterday, so we had an understudy, and we also had a standby for Eliza (I learned yesterday <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-standby-and-understudy-on-broadway"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; background: transparent;"" target=""_blank"">the difference between understudies and standbys</a>, it was all very informative), and, I mean, they were fine, they were hired by the hottest show on Broadway, it wasn&rsquo;t like I didn&rsquo;t think they would be fine.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">But I would be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say that it wasn&rsquo;t an enormous disappointment to me and the primary memory I have of my&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; experience. Which is sad and also unfair, because these things happen, and it&rsquo;s silly for me to not be focused on all of the really awesome part of&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton,&rdquo; which *were* really awesome, and I know I was lucky to just be in the room at all, etc., etc., but I can&rsquo;t help it: I was sad yesterday and I&rsquo;m sad today. My most visceral &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; memory turns out mainly to have been that I stood in the line for the ladies&rsquo; room and watched the rumor about LMM spread through the rest of the line. Which was really quite something to see. It was like the part in&nbsp;&ldquo;Rudolph&rdquo; when all the elves are like&nbsp;&ldquo;Hermey doesn&rsquo;t like to make toys!&rdquo; and it goes spreading through the whole line of elves. And mostly when people asked me today how &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; was, I remembered the way I felt in that moment. Which was not good. <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.00784314);"">And I was mad at myself for feeling not good, so then I was both sad and irritated with myself. </span>And I never really recovered from it for the rest of the play. Like, I just started the play in a not-good headspace and I spent the entire first few songs giving myself a pep talk, like,&nbsp;&ldquo;This is good! This is great! You&rsquo;re having a good time! Look how amazing it is! You&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for so long! Enjoy it!&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">But that was exactly the issue: I&rsquo;d been looking forward to it for a long time. I was <i style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;"">so</i> excited for it. I actually bought my ticket many months ago, and it was a huge decision for me. It wasn&rsquo;t cheap, as you can imagine, and it wasn&rsquo;t easy, as you can also imagine, and I justified it to myself and to all my friends and family as being like,&nbsp;&ldquo;But if I wait and see it at a different time, I won&rsquo;t get this particular original cast experience, and that&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I was prepared for lots of things to go wrong. I was, in fact, even prepared for the possibility that the original cast would start to leave by the time I got there. I had braced myself for it. But that didn&rsquo;t happen. Then I was worried that there would be an issue with the ticket, which didn&rsquo;t come to pass. And I was also worried about the seat itself, because after all of the time and expense of acquiring the ticket, I realized it was partial view, and I was okay with that because at least it got me in the room where it happened and it would be okay.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Which is why I say this was all about managed expectations and how poorly I managed mine. Because the seat? Was AMAZING. Guys, seriously, if you have the chance to buy a partial view seat and you&rsquo;re questioning it, I wouldn&rsquo;t. Yeah, there were parts of the stage I couldn&rsquo;t see, but I was in the <i style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;"">fifth row</i>. And I had spent literally hundreds of dollars less than for full-view seats. I thought it was totally worth it. BUT I had managed my expectations on that. I had braced myself for it to be terrible, so I was super-impressed when it was better than terrible.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">But the understudy possibility had, for some reason, not occurred to me. I don&rsquo;t know why. I mean, it totally should have. I have no idea why I just didn&rsquo;t consider the possibility that I wouldn&rsquo;t see all of the main cast. I really, really should have, but I didn&rsquo;t, so it just absolutely caught me by surprise when it happened. Like, I didn&rsquo;t have time to brace myself, and then I didn&rsquo;t have time to recover, and it just was kind of whatever after that. Was it good? Yes. Of course it was good. It&rsquo;s a good play. It&rsquo;s an incredible play. But it wasn&rsquo;t the&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; experience I&rsquo;d wanted. I know I sound whiney and annoying and entitled. Trust me, I have been yelling at myself for not being able to get my enthusiastic energy up since last night. It was awesome. It was very good. I had a good time.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">But if you&rsquo;re going to see&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton,&rdquo; I genuinely hope your experience blows mine out of the water.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">And, if you&rsquo;re not going to see&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton,&rdquo; the good news is that I think you&rsquo;re going to be absolutely fine if you don&rsquo;t get to see it for a long time, with a traveling cast, etc. It&rsquo;s a good play. It&rsquo;ll hold up fine no matter who&rsquo;s playing the roles. And, in fact, I think you will be fine if you never get to see&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton.&rdquo; I mean, I&rsquo;m glad I saw it, but it&rsquo;s really true that you have the entire play in the soundtrack.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">So, ANYWAY, I know you&rsquo;re all waiting for my *actual impressions of the play,* which are below, with the obvious caveat that I didn&rsquo;t see LMM or Phillippa Soo, so obvs I can&rsquo;t speak to what the play is like with them:</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&ndash;The choreography of the play is pretty amazing.

He&rsquo;s fantastic in the role. I don&rsquo;t know if this was just because I saw the understudy or what, but I was totally on Burr&rsquo;s side.

When all the news about the understudies was circulating, I was like,&nbsp;&ldquo;Ugh, at *least* let me get to see Daveed Diggs,&rdquo; so that made me really happy. (See? All about managing expectations! Once I was told the understudy news, I was seriously relieved by every single person I actually got to see. I felt so, so lucky.) I love his Jefferson. I want there to be a double billing of&nbsp;&ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;1776&Prime; and Diggs plays Jefferson in both. I think that would be amazing. Again, don&rsquo;t know if this was because I saw the understudy performance or what, but I actually was on Jefferson&rsquo;s side live much more than on the soundtrack. Diggs is just super-compelling.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&ndash;I saw Jon Rua as Hamilton. He struck me as being much more puppyish than I had anticipated the part to be. I eavesdropped on the person behind me who had seen the show multiple times and who said Rua&rsquo;s take was&nbsp;&ldquo;more boyish.&rdquo; I think that did affect the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t overly fond of Hamilton. I felt like Burr and Jefferson frankly just wanted him to grow up a little bit, and I sympathized with them. Also, he smiled almost constantly, which made Burr&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;smile more&rdquo; advice feel sarcastic. This might be how it always is? I don&rsquo;t know, but I had never read it that way before, and it was interesting to have that spin put on it.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">So that&rsquo;s that! I feel like I should have something more interesting to say, but honestly it was just kind of an exhaustingly emotional ordeal. Ah, the highs and lows of fandom!

"event","<lj-cut text=""The Abominable Bride Spoilers!""><span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--OMG, you guys, OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG. Was that amaaaaazing? Because, let&rsquo;s face it, the best part of HLV is the Sherlock&rsquo;s mind palace scene, and somehow they found a way to make that last for 90 minutes. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--I have this theory, and that theory is that Moffat is actually in the Inception fandom, and that&rsquo;s why Doctor Who and now Sherlock are so frequently just Inception crossovers. Like, I&rsquo;ve written the Limbo scene where Moriarty tries to taunt Sherlock to die with him. John saves Sherlock in my Limbo scene, too. (Arthur, by the way, absolutely does not approve of how many layers down Sherlock was. It&rsquo;s why his dream got so unstable. He needed some sedative in the Somnacin.)</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--So. Mary in Sherlock&rsquo;s head is a fascinating little creature, isn&rsquo;t she? In Sherlock&rsquo;s head, Mary is all-knowing and constantly reminding him of how stupid he is. If you needed confirmation that it really haunts Sherlock that he missed the fact that John Watson&rsquo;s wife was an assassin until she was pointing a gun at him, well, I think this was it. In Sherlock&rsquo;s head, Mary asks when it occurred to Sherlock that she was more than she seemed and Sherlock admits ruefully, &ldquo;Only now, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; Yeah, we&rsquo;ve seen this scene before. It ended in Sherlock flatlining on an operating table. Here, Mary smiles sweetly and taunts, &ldquo;Must be difficult, being the slow little brother.&rdquo; </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Sherlock is the slow little brother, it&rsquo;s true, and he knows it, but Sherlock has one person smarter than Mycroft in this episode, and that&rsquo;s Mary. Mary is constantly one-upping <i>Mycroft</i>. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> how much credit Sherlock gives to Mary. He has her on this ridiculous pedestal. Forget Irene Adler (well done, John, being creepy in your quest to uncover your rival for Sherlock&rsquo;s affections); to this Sherlock Holmes, Mary Watson is <i>The</i> Woman. He even gives her the responsibility of saving all of England. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">And it was also striking to me how much time and energy Sherlock devotes in his head to saving the Watson marriage. He spotlights again and again in his head how much tension there is in the marriage: they barely see each other, they barely have a civil conversation with each other, etc. The only reason they stop arguing is he because he forces them to stop. This was Sherlock&rsquo;s role throughout S3, basically: Sherlock holds the Watson relationship together through sheer force of will. He thinks Mary is of all-consuming importance to John (why wouldn&rsquo;t he think that? He thinks Mary is the cleverest being of them all, and John Watson likes clever and dangerous people), so he ties himself up in knots to give John Mary. He shrugs off his own murder in the service of the Watson marriage. He gives up his own life for their marriage, multiple times. Sherlock just never stops trying to save the Watson marriage. In his head, he finally gets them there by giving Mary an epic heroic position of Super Sekrit Mycroft Spy who magically solves the entire mystery with minimal explanation. Mary, in Sherlock&rsquo;s head, is the superhero. And, of course, forcing John to acknowledge the superheroics of his wife is what pushes John back to her. Why would John want Sherlock Holmes when he can have the extraordinary Mary Watson? </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&ldquo;Are you even in a fit state?&rdquo; &ldquo;For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson. Never that.&rdquo; Because she is <i>Mary</i>. And Sherlock has to make sure that John never doubts that Sherlock wants the best for Mary. Sherlock can&rsquo;t have John thinking that he is not dedicated to the well-being of the Watson marriage. Sherlock thinks that would drive John away, I think. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--It&#39;s official now, everyone: Sherlock ships Mycroft and Lestrade: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put them in a graveyard. Lestrade will engage in manual labor and roll up his sleeves. There will be a corpse with worms. WHAT COULD BE MORE ROMANTIC???&rdquo; We Mystraders always thought that those two bonded over their shared worry over Sherlock, and there it was <i>explicitly on the screen</i>. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, guys! Go ahead and make out! I&rsquo;m going to go dig frantically in the dirt over here and not pay attention! Maybe I&rsquo;ll pull a skeleton over me for added privacy!&rdquo; </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Sherlock needed to be high to get through saying good-bye to John. <i>Sherlock needed to be high to get through saying good-bye to John.</i> SHERLOCK NEEDED TO BE HIGH TO GET THROUGH SAYING GOOD-BYE TO JOHN. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--That scene between Mycroft and John at the end. When Mycroft&rsquo;s kind of like, &ldquo;John. Dude. Do you think you could do a better job of taking care of my bother than you have so far?&rdquo; We are such a long way from that first conversation in that darkened warehouse, and, from Mycroft&rsquo;s perspective, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve traveled entirely in the right direction. &ldquo;He could be the making of my brother or make him worse than ever,&rdquo; Mycroft said in the very first episode, and I&rsquo;ve always kind of shrugged that line off. I thought Mycroft meant John might make Sherlock more insufferable, but now I think Mycroft saw this coming: John can make Sherlock&rsquo;s self-destructive self-loathing worse than ever, and right now Mycroft is basically begging John to notice that. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Stanford&rsquo;s tie, you guys. NEVER CHANGE, STANFORD. OWN THAT TIE IN EVERY ERA. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--I can&rsquo;t even start with the number of multi-layered references, to ACD canon and BBC canon and then fanon on top of everything else. There were so many layers of interwoven narrative. &ldquo;Is it silly enough for you? Mad enough? Gothic enough?&rdquo; The only piece of writing more meta than &ldquo;Next Big Thing&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Abominable Bride.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--The flashbacks at the beginning were so interesting. Like, they don&rsquo;t do anything about Sherlock being shot. Are we just going to ignore that for the rest of time? I am genuinely worried we&rsquo;re just going to ignore that for the rest of time. I&rsquo;m trying not to let it worry me. But yes. (They also don&rsquo;t do anything with Baskerville or The Blind Banker, either, confirming that those episodes are just so pointless, ha.)</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Sherlock says he is reading John&rsquo;s blog because he&rsquo;s cleverer through John&rsquo;s eyes. And Sherlock&rsquo;s first-level mind palace is entirely through John&rsquo;s eyes. It starts with John&rsquo;s story, it&rsquo;s narrated by John, it&rsquo;s about how John sees him. Everyone&rsquo;s constantly talking about the stories John tells, about the entanglement of the fictional Sherlock with the real Sherlock, because Sherlock works so hard in his head to be the Sherlock John sees. John wants Sherlock held to a higher standard, and Sherlock wants to achieve that so desperately. (Of course, he can only really hold onto this idea in the first level.) </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">But Sherlock&rsquo;s head is such an astonishing place because it betrays with certainty that, for all of his bluster, he actually thinks lots of people are cleverer than he is. Mary certainly is, and Mycroft, and even John in Sherlock&rsquo;s head is &ldquo;pretty damn smart.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the expert,&rdquo; Sherlock allows to John, and it might be in limited areas, but they&rsquo;re areas that count pretty heavily. Especially when your whole life is a story you&rsquo;re trying to tell to others so they don&rsquo;t notice the true you. Being an expert storyteller comes in handy with that. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--From Sherlock&rsquo;s beating the corpse we can discern: Sherlock has a lot of aggression to get out. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">From John&rsquo;s little half-smile at Sherlock beating the corpse we can discern: John&rsquo;s totally a-okay with that, yup. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--If I got started on all the little moments I loved, I&rsquo;d never stop: </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">the fantastic first scene with Mrs. Hudson, </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman in my sitting room. Was that intentional?&rdquo;, </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">the whole twins dialogue, </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Sherlock&rsquo;s delight over his &ldquo;death us do part&rdquo; joke, </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">the sign language bit, </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">the way Sherlock says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Moriarty&rsquo;s question about dust being skin cells, like, &ldquo;<i>obviously</i>, Moriarty, that&rsquo;s Creepy Science 101,&rdquo; </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&ldquo;Speaking as a criminal mastermind, we don&rsquo;t really have gongs. Or special outfits.&rdquo;, </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">the way Moriarty delivers that &ldquo;The Napoleon of Crime&rdquo; line.</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--In every episode of Sherlock, there must be at least one John Watson Likes the Ladies scene. Behold, John knows Molly is a female. Why? Because John Watson knows ladies, k? </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson are the cutest. I want at least one scene with just them, forever. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--I love John Watson the writer. We don&rsquo;t get as much of him in modern canon. I loved how much depended on John Watson being a storyteller here. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Why does Sherlock seem so upset about John&rsquo;s dancing lessons? Is it because he didn&rsquo;t get to give John the dancing lessons in 1895? </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--In Sherlock&rsquo;s head, Mycroft is enormous in stature (literally) and involved in everything but cheerfully willing to die and go away at a fixed point in time in the very near future. It&rsquo;s like Sherlock&rsquo;s head can&rsquo;t actually bear to be rid of Mycroft entirely, but soothes itself by thinking, &ldquo;You only have to put up with him for a little while longer.&rdquo; Ah, the Sherlock/Mycroft relationship. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Note how much the Holmeses deny their emotions in Sherlock&rsquo;s head. They both seem delighted to pretend they don&rsquo;t have hearts, and Sherlock is constantly denying that he feels any emotions at all, even in the face of John&rsquo;s conviction otherwise. This contrasts so beautifully with how over-the-top emotional both of them are in the modern day scenes. Sherlock is <i>reading the blog of the day he met John what the hell Sherlock</i> and Mycroft looks about ready to weep, a far cry from the Mycroft we usually see, sincere and broken and sweet. These Holmeses try so hard to be so stiff-upper-lip in their heads, because they are such emotional disasters, it&rsquo;s a mess.</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Yeah, Mycroft, a lot of this is your fault because I don&rsquo;t understand why you ever had Sherlock in prison in the first place. And why <i>don&rsquo;t</i> you get him a pardon? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MYCROFT? WHY DO YOU REMAIN SUCH A CONFUSING PART OF HLV? But that bit where Mycroft says, &ldquo;What do you think of MI-5 security?&rdquo; and Mary says, &ldquo;I think it would be a good idea&rdquo;? The look Mycroft gives Mary? I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mycroft, she killed your beloved little brother who you&rsquo;ve gone to a lot of trouble to keep alive and now she&rsquo;s insulting your security. TAKE HER DOWN, MYCROFT.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--You know, whenever Sherlock gets really excited and happy about something, that&rsquo;s the moment when people tell him to dial it down a notch. No wonder Sherlock has learned to pretend not to have emotions. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--&ldquo;Death. DEATH. Nothing, drop it, nothing, hahaha, lovely weather we&rsquo;re having.&rdquo; Eustace Carmichael, you&rsquo;re my ridiculous favorite right there. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Okay. So. The discussion they have while on their ghost stakeout. I read that as: Sherlock is so frustrated by exactly how much John doesn&rsquo;t understand Sherlock&rsquo;s feelings for him. He wants John to be obsessed with his sex life but can&rsquo;t even imagine how that would go. Instead, John asks him annoying, pointless questions he wishes would stop, because he can&rsquo;t imagine John asking him the questions he wants asked (&ldquo;Are you in love with me? Would you like to spend the rest of our lives together?&rdquo;). (Incidentally, this was also a point in KtCR, that Sherlock couldn&rsquo;t imagine John saying he loved him, not even in his wildest dreams. It&rsquo;s true in this episode, too. Sherlock can&rsquo;t quite get himself there.)</span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">So Sherlock wants to have a super-intimate conversation with John, but he can&rsquo;t imagine what that John would be like. For Sherlock, the central trait of John is that <i>he doesn&rsquo;t get how Sherlock feels</i>. Sherlock creates for himself a John who is deeply involved in Sherlock&rsquo;s love life, but it manifests itself in weird invasions of privacy to spy on Sherlock instead of anything more traditionally romantic, because Sherlock can&rsquo;t see how anything else would go. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">With the added complication, of course, that it&rsquo;s Victorian London and Sherlock is, I think, obviously gay. The whole time John was questioning him, I was like, &ldquo;John Watson, he&rsquo;s a homosexual. Stop pestering him.&rdquo; But then I guess that&rsquo;s why John asks what &ldquo;made&rdquo; Sherlock this way. Like, is he trying to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; Sherlock? Does Sherlock think John wants to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; him? It all fits in very nicely with the very last scene about Sherlock being &ldquo;a man out of his time.&rdquo; A gay man in London was definitely out of his time, but I don&rsquo;t think Sherlock feels comfortable in modern times, either. Sherlock can&rsquo;t imagine the world where he just <i>is</i>. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--Moriarty mentions rolling around in Sherlock&rsquo;s bed. Everything about Sherlock&rsquo;s conversation with Moriarty is sexually charged, because Sherlock can&rsquo;t get that level of flirtation from John. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--This is me whenever Mary talks: Shut up. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not making any sense, Sherlock.&rdquo; Me: Shut up. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem high.&rdquo; Me: Shut up. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">And, like, why is Mary snooping through Sherlock&rsquo;s phone? Put his phone down, Mary. Ugh. </span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--It was good to see Janine again. Is Sherlock&rsquo;s head trying to deal with all of the women he&rsquo;s wronged?</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--That scene in the graveyard, before the Mystrade date. In that scene, John abandons Sherlock (to go off with Mary). John yells at him that too many people indulge Sherlock. It&rsquo;s what Sherlock thinks he needs to hear, of course. Mycroft and Lestrade stay behind to help Sherlock because I think Sherlock thinks they&rsquo;re the people who indulge him too much. Mycroft and Lestrade are the people who love him no matter what, who will be there for him always, and he knows that. He&rsquo;s less certain about John, though. After all, John has The Great Mary, and John wants Sherlock to hold himself to a higher standard. Sherlock can disappoint John. He knows that. He has in the past. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">Which makes it such an incredibly sweet triumph that, the next layer down, in the confrontation with Moriarty, John comes back. John doesn&rsquo;t leave him alone and abandoned. John comes back and says that Sherlock is never alone. Sherlock gets to hear it, and Sherlock finds his way back to the world. It&rsquo;s always John Watson who gives Sherlock a reason to come back. You get the feeling Mycroft knows that, when he asks John to take care of Sherlock. Mycroft can stand by and hold a torch all he wants while Sherlock digs himself into huge holes, but it&rsquo;s John Watson who really keeps Sherlock alive, and Mycroft needs him to understand that. </span></span>

&nbsp; <span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">And Moriarty, of course, suggests John and Sherlock elope. It&rsquo;s the closest Sherlock gets in his own head to an acknowledgment of what the relationship between him and John really is, the closest he&rsquo;ll <i>let</i> himself get to it, and I think, for him, it&rsquo;s enough that he got to have that moment. It&rsquo;s possibly more than he thought he&rsquo;d ever have, even in his own head. YOU KILL ME, SHERLOCK HOLMES.</span></span>

<span style=""font-family:times new roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;"">--The actual best part of this episode is when Sherlock&rsquo;s hair and coat come back.</span></span></lj-cut>"

It had been getting progressively slower and slower, until by the end it was completely unuseable. AO3 worked fine for me if I wasn&rsquo;t logged in, but if I was logged in, it refused to load. It didn&rsquo;t matter which browser I used, which computer I used, which network I was on. The problem, it was clear, was with my account. And the lovely tech wizards figured it out for me. It turns out that you can&rsquo;t have 60,000 messages in your AO3 inbox. Who knew??? I never use my AO3 inbox, so I literally had never looked at the thing, and apparently it can slow down your entire AO3 experience. So here&rsquo;s my PSA: If you, like me, don&rsquo;t use your AO3 inbox, if you having a sub-optimal AO3 experience, go in and delete your messages. It&rsquo;s worked like a charm since they did that. THANKS, AO3 TECH SUPPORT!</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">And, because my AO3 got fixed, now I can give you my stats as found on my AO3 dashboard (I never realized that was there!

I am glad to be done with it. Let me tell you, writing the scene where Mary shoots Sherlock was actually so upsetting that I procrastinated it forever and then, once it was done, I walked away from the fic so I could recover. It&rsquo;s no coincidence at all that the fic I kept walking away to was NBT, which was so frothy and angst-free that it basically floats off the page.</p><p style=""margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 20px; background: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background: transparent;"">Filthiest Fic:</b> Do I write filthy fics?

I probably will scale back a little bit this year. And make sure (once the KtCR Johnlock epilogue is over) that I only post after I&rsquo;m done writing.

"event","<lj-cut text=""And the Rest of the Categories!"">Best Movie I Saw This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJnMQG9ev8"">&ldquo;Mad Max: Fury Road.&rdquo;</a> I did not expect to be impressed by this movie. I was very impressed by this movie. Many words have been written about amazing this movie is, so I don&rsquo;t really need to write any more. All I have to say is: Thanks, Tom Hardy, for being in this movie, so that I felt compelled to go and see it, and therefore got to experience it.

Movie That Surprised Me the Most This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShIAH_G-Iuw"">&ldquo;The Night Before.&rdquo;</a> I was, on the whole, actually pretty bad about stalking my various boyfriends in their movies this year. But I did go see &ldquo;The Night Before&rdquo; and was pleasantly surprised by how hilarious I found it. And also by the fact that JGL is basically the star of the movie. I thought it was silly and light-hearted but quite charming, and I laughed very hard of it. My favorite part, though, was JGL&rsquo;s dimples. Runner-up: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbxmsDFVnE"">&ldquo;The Force Awakens.&rdquo;</a> I know the entire planet was super-excited for this movie but I was mostly dreading it because I remembered how all of the prequel movies were. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie being, like, actually good. Good dialogue! Good acting! Good job!

Movie with the Best Clothing: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4UDNzXD3qA"">&ldquo;SPECTRE.&rdquo;</a> Everyone in this movie wears the most spectacular clothing. None of it is at all practical (good job packing <a>a white pants suit</a> to go take down a megalomaniac) and don&rsquo;t even get me started on when the Bond girl bought <a>that evening gown</a> and how it got packed in her tiny bag but it was all so <i>beautiful</i>. If you&rsquo;re not going to make any sense, at least look lovely doing it. The woman looked gorgeous, <a>Daniel Craig looked edible</a>, and <a href=""https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSH_jcT90UNcs7MBSdJClhg3-ujGTMZANNo4QHLFh0IVpVLdkckrA"">Q&rsquo;s sweater in Switzerland</a> made me want to be best friends with Q. Can we make that happen?

British Actor with the Most Amazing Hair This Year: <a>Ben Whishaw</a>. In a year when one of my other British boyfriends just kept saying sad things about his beautiful hair, Ben Whishaw was never afraid to let his hair grow ever more cotton-candy-ish atop his head. Own it, Ben; you wear it well.

Best British Actor Moment This Year: <a>Tom Hardy bringing Woody to the &ldquo;Legend&rdquo; premiere.</a> There was genuinely a time in my life when Tom Hardy elicited merely a shrug from me, and now I see photos of him and think, Look at that gorgeous specimen of a man. Probably a lot of it has to do with the fact that he does silly things like this. (Also: he&rsquo;s a pretty gorgeous specimen of a man.)

Best Moment in a Movie Theater: The gun barrel opening of &ldquo;SPECTRE.&rdquo; I was SO NERVOUS, you guys. So nervous they wouldn&rsquo;t do this. AND THEN THEY DID. It was almost like it didn&rsquo;t matter what the rest of the movie was like, because GUN BARREL.

Best Fiction Book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lies-Locke-Lamora-Gentleman-Bastards/dp/055358894X"">&ldquo;The Lies of Locke Lamora.&rdquo;</a> This was recommended to me by someone on Twitter so I stuck it on my TBR list, and then randomly I picked it up this summer when it was the only book on my TBR list that was in the bookstore I was in. Lucky me, because I adored this book. I think I read it described somewhere as Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven only on an alien planet and yup, basically. I love stories about con artists and heists and stuff anyway, and this is a really gloriously good one, and Locke is a delight of a character. Trust me: Go read this.

Best Non-Fiction Book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Walkable-City-Downtown-Save-America-ebook/dp/B008423170/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451453733&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=walkable+city"">&ldquo;Walkable City.&rdquo;</a> I have long wanted to learn more about urban planning. I feel like, in a different life, where I understood engineering, I would have been an urban planner. It has long been a topic of great fascination to me. So I solicited a bunch of reading recs on Twitter and once again ended up with this one because it was the one in the bookstore I was in. But this book was AMAZING. I think of things I learned in this book all the time. I learned about how parking works, and how walking works, and how public transportation should work, and how streets should be built, and how to get rid of traffic, and seriously, I think people are sick of listening to me talk about the things I learned in this book, but I learned A LOT. And it was very readable and engaging. If you want to know more about why you sit in traffic or why you should be paying for parking, I recommend you read this book, too.

Favorite Ship This Year: the couple on &ldquo;Fixer-Upper.&rdquo; I chose &ldquo;Love It or List It&rdquo; as the show in my HGTV verse, but the more I watched HGTV this year, the more I realized that my real basis for Arthur and Eames in that &lsquo;verse was the couple on &ldquo;Fixer-Upper&rdquo; (funnily enough, the name I gave the first fic). These two are so sweet and adorable. I love them.

Most Delightful Thing to Happen This Year: <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/3349583"">&ldquo;Next Big Thing.&rdquo;</a> I never expected anything about NBT. It was not a story I planned to write. At all. I never knew what was going to happen in NBT until it happened. And the best part about it was I was discovering all of it at the same time as the readers. I have never written a fic in such real time. I have never written a fic with such extravagant amounts of reader input. I have never written a fic so meta. That fic is *multi* meta. I mean, it&rsquo;s a fic about being the object of fandom and then belonging to your own fandom. It&rsquo;s a fic in which the main characters read and write fic. It&rsquo;s meta-ception. And, truthfully, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever written such a self-indulgent fic before. It&rsquo;s crowded with every trope I could think of, it meanders in and out and around some laughable excuse for a plot, there are whole chapters in which nothing happens but the characters quipping at each other. I loved every second of NBT. Every second of it. It threw off everything about my writing schedule in a way I still haven&rsquo;t recovered from, but I think I needed NBT. And I think I needed all of you who read it, who comment-partied every night, who shaped it with your reactions and your suggestions and your love. It&rsquo;s basically a crowd-sourced fic, and it reminded me of how much fun fandom can be. And am I tickled by having the most commented-on fic on all of AO3? Well, yeah, I am, I have to admit. I consider it a marvelous treat to have had NBT this year, and I thank all of you for making it the unforgettable ride that it was. The best part about NBT to me is that AO3 <i>still</i> won&rsquo;t let me mark it as complete. It&rsquo;s basically the fic that will never end. And I somehow think that&rsquo;s kind of appropriate for it.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""The Usual Categories! Again! Already!"">Best Album of the Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp9HUc9HraQ"">&ldquo;Hamilton.&rdquo;</a> I vaguely wanted to see &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; because <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/hamiltons"">the New Yorker made it sound awesome </a>(the way the New Yorker does). Then the soundtrack was released, and everyone was freaking out online, and I listened to it...and was immediately floored. This musical is an astonishing achievement. I can&rsquo;t even find words to describe it. Just listen to it (if you haven&rsquo;t already). Runner-up: Well, until a couple of months ago I was giving this honor to Taylor Swift&rsquo;s &ldquo;1989&rdquo; because I&rsquo;ve loved every single song on that album.

Most Listened-to Song This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrsmUzqweBI"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quiet Uptown&rdquo;</a> I love many, many songs in &ldquo;Hamilton,&rdquo; but this one is my absolute favorite. This song <i>kills me every single time I listen to it</i>. I feel like eventually I will hit a point in my life when I will stop crying over &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quiet Uptown,&rdquo; but I haven&rsquo;t hit it yet. One night I sat and just kept hitting play on this song and weeping. It was a bad situation. Once I had this song stuck in my head and started singing it to myself in my kitchen while I was putting dishes away AND STILL FOUND MYSELF CRYING. I am not allowed to listen to this song in the car because it gets me too emotional. <i>This song.</i> This musical, you guys. I can&rsquo;t even with the brilliance of this musical. Runner-up: Swinging radically to the opposite side of things: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNpSpMMfQis"">&ldquo;Things Happen&rdquo; by Dawes</a> I went through a phase where I was totally obsessed with this song and was fond of listening to it in the car and singing along very loudly. I consider it a very Arthur song. As Arthur&rsquo;s head was my favorite place to be this year, it made sense that I wanted to spend a lot of time with this song.

Song I Did the Most Writing to This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvW9E2606Oc"">&ldquo;Down by the Water&rdquo; by the Drums</a> This song was my &ldquo;Next Big Thing&rdquo; writing theme song, so yeah, you might say I did a little bit of writing to it this year. It&rsquo;s actually carried over to my other Arthur/Eames writing. There&rsquo;s something about it that works for me for the sort of soft devoted established relationship I write for these two most of the time. Runner-up: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7GeHrWWPD4"">&ldquo;Friends with Enemies&rdquo; by Atlas Genius</a>, which is the theme song of the original book I&rsquo;m writing. I actually chose Atlas Genius as that book&rsquo;s soundtrack, but I&rsquo;ve become most attached to this song. The playlist for that book has basically devolved into this song on constant repeat.

Song I Was Happiest to Encounter on the Radio This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk"">&ldquo;Style&rdquo; by Taylor Swift</a>. I&rsquo;ve already said that I loved &ldquo;1989,&rdquo; and this was my favorite song off the album. It was a year in which I otherwise wasn&rsquo;t too taken with most of the songs I heard on the radio, which was why the fact that I loved every &ldquo;1989&rdquo; single really stood out to me.

Worst Song I Heard This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jzDnsjYv9A"">Sam Smith&rsquo;s Bond theme</a>. Ugh, I hate that song. Why is that song so <i>boring</i>? I can never even remember what that song sounds like because I think I fall asleep in the middle of it. Maybe any song that came after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvl1_IgGmI"">&ldquo;Skyfall&rdquo;</a> was going to be disappointing, but I thought &ldquo;SPECTRE&rdquo; held up pretty well even though it came after &ldquo;Skyfall.&rdquo; This song, though? I thought I would like it better after I saw the movie, but&hellip;nope.

Weirdest Television Show I Watched This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYIg56qobs"">&ldquo;London Spy.&rdquo;</a> Everyone online was watching this show, and I was worried it would start airing on BBCA while I was home in January (which isn&rsquo;t good television-watching time for me) so I asked my friends if maybe they wanted to give it a try. And we sat and watched every single episode of that show and most of the time our reaction was, &hellip;Huh. It wasn&rsquo;t <i>bad</i>, it was just&hellip;the weirdest show. But a really good example of modern Gothic.

Favorite Television Show: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SZfznYgToc"">&ldquo;Lip Sync Battle.&rdquo;</a> This show brings me more joy than anything else on television. Every time I watch it, I&rsquo;m amazed that it exists. I want a gazillion more shows this good-natured and high-spirited and just <i>fun</i>. I also want Chrissy Tiegen&rsquo;s job on this show. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could do Chrissy Tiegen&rsquo;s job on this show.

Television Moment of the Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWs1QkK9k8"">JGL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhythm Nation.&rdquo;</a> As soon as &ldquo;Lip Sync Battle&rdquo; became a thing, I was desperate for JGL to go on it. AND THEN IT FINALLY HAPPENED. AND IT WAS AMAZING.

Favorite Plotted Television Show: There was a time when I thought it would be easier to pay for television a la carte, and then I could just pay for the stations I wanted and ignore all the other ones. What the rise of streaming services has actually taught me, though, is that I am apparently too lazy and unfocused to pay for television that way. Which is to say that I was bored by pretty much all conventional television this year but also lacking in the ambition to do unconventional television. When I sat down to think about my favorite television show of the year, it was actually a struggle. But I have come up with one: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj538vo-_gE"">&ldquo;The Grinder.&rdquo;</a> I have long had a moratorium on watching shows about lawyers, because of how much they get wrong. What I love about &ldquo;The Grinder&rdquo; is that it&rsquo;s consciously all about what lawyer shows get wrong. Rob Lowe is hilariously perfect in the role, and Fred Savage plays the brilliant straight man, sort of the Jason Bateman role. The show is funnier and cleverer than I expected it to be. It&rsquo;s been a pleasant surprise, in a year that was otherwise a television desert for me.

Show That Made All the Same Mistakes: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FLHB2zB_cA"">&ldquo;Heroes Reborn.&rdquo;</a> For the course of its first season, &ldquo;Heroes&rdquo; was so amazing. And then it drowned under the weight of all of its disjointed, disconnected characters. There were always so many of them flitting around, self-centered and focused on their own individual storylines, and it was so hard to really care about so many of them, even when their storylines eventually linked up. So why it is &ldquo;Heroes Reborn&rdquo; decided to immediately launch into roughly eleventy billion different storylines and expect me to care about all of these characters I couldn&rsquo;t even keep straight was beyond me. There were a couple of moments that were mildly good about this show, but mostly I just missed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYx4wwtgLfg"">the inappropriate chemistry of the Petrelli family</a>. Weren&rsquo;t we all just watching for that anyway?

Show That Has Fallen into the &quot;Happy Couples Are Boring&quot; Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: &quot;Castle.&quot; Happy couples are *not* boring. I just spent hundreds of thousands of words with a couple that refused to be anything but happy. They&#39;re not boring. Too bad &quot;Castle&quot; won&#39;t let us see that.

Favorite Character: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMvgwKJqyi8"">Ravi from &ldquo;iZombie.&rdquo;</a> Hot and smart and delightfully snarky, Ravi is actually the star of this show, I think (which is otherwise also noteworthy for Liv&rsquo;s hair, which is the television hair I covet the most). Runner-up: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc8En-8irFA"">Missy from &ldquo;Doctor Who.&rdquo;</a> A lot of times, the Doctor can just take everything so seriously. I find Missy a breath of fresh air. I especially like what she brings out in the Doctor. I buy their complex, messed-up, ill-advised relationship. It&rsquo;s exactly how I think the Doctor&rsquo;s relationship with the Master should be at this point. I still miss John Simm&rsquo;s Master, but Missy is a sparkling take on the character.

Character Who Makes Me Roll My Eyes a Lot: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y535dyj10tk"">Me on &ldquo;Doctor Who.&rdquo;</a> Ugh, am I supposed to find her endearing or something? Am I supposed to think she&rsquo;s some kind of moral conscience keeping the Doctor in line? Am I supposed to feel bad for her? Because mostly I can&rsquo;t stand all of her judgey speechifying all the time. And I genuinely can&rsquo;t tell if the show thinks I&rsquo;m supposed to like her or what.

Character I Am Most Tired of: Lily on &ldquo;The Vampire Diaries.&rdquo; I do not understand why this woman continues to wonder why her sons don&rsquo;t like her. Apparently, Lily is the stupidest vampire to have ever lived for centuries. And I do not understand why the rest of her little coven is so devoted to her. I get that she&rsquo;s supposed to be this epic maternal figure, but she just lacks chemistry with anyone else on the show. The contentious bond between Damon and Stefan basically sits at the heart of TVD, and they somehow make it work because I believe that they love each other and also are exasperated by each other. I wish they would stop getting themselves hung up on their worthless mother.

Character They Keep Mentioning So I Keep Watching: Rebekah on &ldquo;The Originals.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t that &ldquo;The Originals&rdquo; is bad, exactly. It&rsquo;s that it suffers from &ldquo;Heroes&rdquo; syndrome, and keeps flinging new characters at me. For instance: &ldquo;Oh, look, here&rsquo;s the real love of Klaus&rsquo;s life, ignore that we&rsquo;ve never mentioned her before!&rdquo; I love Elijah, of course, but the real reason I keep watching &ldquo;The Originals&rdquo; is because they keep mentioning Rebekah often enough that I live in hope of a full-time return and a glorious reunion with Marcel. Rebekah has always been one of my favorite characters. I miss her desperately. STOP TEASING ME, &ldquo;ORIGINALS.&rdquo;

Show Most Likely to Make Me Hungry: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq2fnaOlToQ"">&ldquo;The Great Holiday Baking Show.&rdquo;</a> I have never seen the British original because I&rsquo;ve failed at catching it on PBS when it airs, but I was on top of things enough to DVR &ldquo;The Holiday Baking Show&rdquo; and it was very charming and also I spent every single episode starving. Which might be a point <i>against</i> ever chasing down the British original.

Television Show That Reminded Me That I Don&rsquo;t Really Remember the Book That Well: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE1nsOoTJos"">&ldquo;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.&rdquo;</a> I actually really adored that book, but it has been years since I read it, and I mainly spent the television show being like, &hellip;Did that happen in the book? I don&rsquo;t remember that being that way. Wait, wasn&rsquo;t there something else here? Et cetera. That said, I thought this was a very good adaptation, even if I thought it didn&rsquo;t quite get across how brilliantly and intricately plotted the book is. One of the changes it made to the book was an excellent choice, though, and that was getting Jonathan Strange in on the action much earlier than the book does.

Most Fun Episode of Television This Year: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-L-ByHzto0"">&ldquo;The Husbands of River Song.&rdquo;</a> I was excited for the return of River Song, because somehow, someway, River Song has become one of my favorites. And the River Song / Twelve dynamic was as fabulous as I&rsquo;d hoped it would be. I loved how they played off of each other, and I just loved the tone of the episode. It was very caper-y, very light and breezy, and the fact that it ended with that &ldquo;happily ever after,&rdquo; when River&rsquo;s story started off as a bedtime story in her very first episode, gah, that just killed me. I need to re-watch all of River&rsquo;s episodes and they probably make no sense, but there was a weird way in which I was seriously impressed at how much sense this episode managed to make to me. It reminded me of what Moffat can do.

"event","Guys, this is my SEVENTH YEAR of Advent drabbles! Does that make it officially a tradition?

If this is the first year for you and you don&#39;t know the drill, here it is: Sign up for a drabble! The first 24 people to leave a one-word prompt in a comment to this entry will get a drabble of their very own, posted one each day in December until Christmas. A one-word prompt is all that I ask, but, if you like, you can request specific characters/&#39;verses. (I only make promises to the first 24, but sometimes I do get around to more than that.) The one-word prompt can be holiday-themed or not; it&#39;s up to you!

If you don&#39;t have an LJ account, you shouldn&#39;t have a problem with anonymously commenting to this post, and I&#39;ll approve it to save your spot. Drabbles will be posted both here on LJ and to Tumblr, tagged with your Tumblr username, so you should see it (as long as you&#39;re sure to tell me your Tumblr username). You can also tag anonymously, if you prefer, but it&#39;s harder for me to find you to tell you your drabble is up. :-)

I consider the holiday season to have started officially now, so, no matter which of the December holidays you celebrate, I hope you have a season of grace, peace, love, and joy."

"event","I wrote up <a href=""http://www.skylardorset.com/my-spectre-review/"">an incredibly long review of SPECTRE</a>, so if you want to know specifically what I thought about SPECTRE, it is there in great detail (spoiler: I loved it).

<lj-cut text=""Vague Movie Spoilers. And Lots of Other Things."">But, as I was watching the movie, I was having the thought that all franchises with long canons eventually reboot. Like, I love James Bond movies, absolutely adore them, and I love the Daniel Craig James Bond movies, but they exist in this sort of weird parallel universe place where all of the other James Bond movies both do and do not exist all at the same time, like some sort of Schrodinger&#39;s cat of canon. Like, on the one hand, everything in the Craig movies feels new, like it&#39;s happening to this Bond for the first time, like it&#39;s a straight reboot, and, on the other hand, the movies contain all these sly references to the old movies as if they also all happened, too. Like, &quot;SPECTRE&quot; has a little aside where Bond says he called his American friend Felix, who has not shown up yet in Craig&#39;s films, I don&#39;t think, but is a pretty steady presence in every Bond era before Craig, and I loved the little acknowledgment of history while at the same time being like, &quot;Is there a timeline in these movies anymore? Or does everything just exist all at once?&quot;

And this is a thing I&#39;ve also been thinking with regard to a show like &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; too. I&#39;ve seen a lot of criticism that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has rewritten what&#39;s happened so many times that it&#39;s impossible to untangle. But that&#39;s what&#39;s happened to the Bond films as well. So it seems like it&#39;s a trend. To keep your canon going, you have to weirdly be willing to jettison a bunch of it.

And this is really what&#39;s happening with &quot;Sherlock,&quot; too. Like, &quot;Sherlock&quot; itself was a massive reboot of the canon: take the canon, move it to the 21st century, write it all again. And now, what is &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot; but a reboot of <i>that</i>. Back in the original Victorian era, no less, which is never going to fail to crack me up. But the trailers make clear that we&#39;re not just going back to the Victorian era, we are once again doing their meet-cute. We&#39;re redoing the origin story. We&#39;re rebooting.

And this isn&#39;t limited to James Bond and Moffat. This is what &quot;Star Wars&quot; is doing, too. Watch the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trailer, and they&#39;ve reduced the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; (by which I mean the original trilogy and not all those terrible prequels) to the stuff of myth and legend, which gives them room to stretch out in their canon, jettison a bunch of it, reboot and try again. And it&#39;s what &quot;Star Trek&quot; has done as well.

And this all makes total sense to me, upon reflection. Because I think you reach a point where you will just drown under the weight of your own canon. Where there is too much that has already been happened, too much that has been foreclosed, and there is nowhere else to go. You feel strangled and suffocated and trapped. So you reboot. It&#39;s the only way to move ahead. This is something we should all understand, because this is the true fanfiction impulse, I think. I feel like we write ourselves a lot of fix-it fics to fic the canon, but what we&#39;re really doing, in every single fic, is rebooting. Doing it this way, and then that way, and then this way. I have written Sherlock and John meeting and falling in love countless times. I get why Mofftiss want to go back to that. It&#39;s <i>fun</i>.

&quot;Sherlock&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; are not just pieces of fanfiction in the sense that they&#39;re writing new stories about old characters. They&#39;re also pieces of fanfiction because they&#39;re doing it by rebooting. Canon gets in the way. We all feel it. I&#39;ve had a hard time writing &quot;Sherlock&quot; after S3 because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do with the canon and the advice I&#39;ve usually received is, &quot;Just ignore it.&quot; The impulse to do this in fanfiction is exactly what all of the canon creators find themselves confronting at a certain point: The canon has left them nowhere to go. So they have to just ignore it.

And that upsets us as fans, frequently. Or, well, it upsets me. I have, for a long time, felt like it&#39;s cheating, somehow. Like, you made that mess, fix it. But the thing is, I&#39;m starting to think now that&#39;s not fair. Because I actually think there is no way to not end up in a mess, the longer you draw out your canon. It&#39;s inevitably going to get there. I have the freedom to start the next AU, to move on, to write it again and have everyone understand what I&#39;m doing because I&#39;m writing fic and it&#39;s how we live. I think I&#39;ve been judging the canon creators more harshly. Maybe because I&#39;ve been internalizing the idea that they must be &quot;better&quot; than me because they&#39;re writing the canon and I&#39;m just doing the fic, but no, they&#39;re exactly the same as me, they&#39;re going to hit exactly the same issues, no matter what. They&#39;re not acrobats who will escape this. Their canon will drown them, so they have to reboot.

I have written multiple Sherlock AUs and multiple Inception AUs. Not because it got boring once I got them together--I hate the myth that established relationship stories are inevitably boring, because that is just <i>not true </i>and I love to write and read established relationship stories--but because I loved them so much that I itched to fix them again, make them happy again, be back in that moment with them where I got to do that for them. I notably didn&#39;t really do that with my Doctor Who fic, but you know what I did instead? I moved on to the next generation. I had OCs that the stories then started to revolve around, and I got to write them falling in love, or finding their adventures, getting to know their TARDISes, etc. This is why soap operas don&#39;t drown under the weight of their canon as often as all the stuff I just mentioned, because they move on to new characters. But I think, if you&#39;re going to keep the same central characters, reboots might be an inevitable part of it. They certainly seem to be in a lot of contexts. And I <i>get</i> that. In a weird way, watching &quot;SPECTRE&quot; and its weird ambiguous timeline, I was like, &quot;I get this. You want all of the James Bonds to exist at once. Because you love them all. That&#39;s a good thing. I support that.&quot; I have always said, honestly, that I would rather my canon creators love their characters to absolute distraction and let <i>that</i> be the cause of their mistake, then not care about them and make mistakes out of indifference.

And, as a random aside, I do not ship 00Q, but if you do, wow, is this movie a gift. I could not get over how suggestive all of Bond and Q&#39;s dialogue was. Like, the very first line said to Bond about Q is that Q has something very special in store for Bond. Was that just me reading it through your ship goggles? What about the fact that Bond&#39;s in trouble and so Q <i>shows up where he is</i>? Instead of, like, you know, <i>getting in touch with him any other way</i>? And then immediately says to him, &quot;Come to my hotel room.&quot;&nbsp;I have thought recently that I love &quot;Inception&quot; because my canon&#39;s closed and no one&#39;s going to come in and interfere with it and that&#39;s lovely, but this movie actually made me wish that I got new canon that looked like <i>that</i> (instead of new canon like S3 of &quot;Sherlock&quot; that just destroyed me). You guys in that fandom, enjoy yourselves. I&#39;ll have a martini and toast the glee I&#39;m sure you&#39;re experiencing.</lj-cut>"

"event","And how I think I should be walking more. I miss walking. I miss living in a city and *having* to walk. And I was feeling really guilty about how little I walk here. I live close enough to things to walk to them but I almost never do it.

And then I read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Walkable-City-Downtown-Save-America/dp/0865477728"">&quot;Walkable City,&quot;</a> which everyone should read because it was *amazing,* and I learned all about how distance is only one aspect of walking, you also have to make walkers feel welcome and give them interesting things to look at, etc. Well, there&#39;s no sidewalk around my house and it&#39;s hilly so the car have no sight lines and came barrelling down making me feel unsafe, so that contributes somewhat to my lack of desire to walk. And then, when there are sidewalks? Apparently people believe their primary purpose is to give them extra space to park their enormous pick-up trucks on.

<img alt="""" src=""http://earlgreytea68.tumblr.com/image/131786761036"" />

(I don&#39;t know, is that image not working? Whatevs, technology.)

The point is: as a walker? Not feeling very welcome.

But this didn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t still miss walking, because I do. I use it as head-clearing space in a way that driving isn&#39;t for me. I am endlessly annoyed when I am driving, I do not find it relaxing at all. Fortuitously, I happened upon a park that is less than a mile from my house and has a pleasant walking trail, not too long, just enough to act as a brisk pick-me-up in the mornings. And it&#39;s within sight of lots of houses all the time, which I find reassuring, considering all the signs they feel it necessary to tell you that no guns are allowed, NOT EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LICENSE FOR THEM.

So I&#39;ve been walking a few mornings a week, and to keep me company while I walk, I have started listening to podcasts. I thought I&#39;d listen to music while I walked and plot out stories the way I used to when I lived in cities, but, I don&#39;t know, I was craving more structure to my walking. Podcasts are not something I&#39;d ever been able to figure out before. I have lots of friends who listen to lots of them but I don&#39;t do iTunes and I couldn&#39;t figure out how everyone was finding them, etc. Then a friend introduced me to the concept of <a href=""https://www.stitcher.com/"">Stitcher Radio</a>, which has been eye-opening for me. I poke around their top 100 podcasts until I find one that sounds interesting and not too long. This foolproof method of choosing has resulted in me listening to lots and lots of random podcasts hosted entirely by women, which I of course find fascinating. Is this true across podcasts in general? Is it more female-heavy? Is this because there are fewer barriers to entry so women can actually get a toe in the door?

No idea, but the reason I&#39;m off on this tangent is because I listened to this episode of <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/invisible-girlfriend-texting-turkle/"">&quot;Note to Self&quot;</a> the other day. It started out talking about this service called Invisible Girlfriend and then posed the question of whether you can have a relationship based entirely on texting but then there was a point made that so much of online interaction feels shallow that people actually crave deeper online interaction. This struck a chord with me because I had just been part of a fascinating conversation on Tumblr about fan dynamic that we--all of the participants--gave up on because Tumblr is such an impossible platform to have a conversation on. As I&#39;ve been told many times--and as I understand--that&#39;s not supposed to be the point of Tumblr. But I guess I&#39;m wondering: where *do* those deeper online connections happen these days? I hate to be the old person being all &quot;In my day, on LJ, we could have real conversations,&quot; but, like, we *could.* No one uses Tumblr for that kind of thing. It doesn&#39;t work. I adore Twitter, but 140 characters isn&#39;t conducive to serious conversations. So where is it you&#39;re supposed to go? Does fandom these days not feel the need to have more in-depth conversations? Are they going somewhere else for them? I&#39;m genuinely curious. I feel like every platform wants to be Facebook; where&#39;s the place where the interaction *isn&#39;t* Facebook-y?

Random thoughts from me. In other news, I volunteered to be the point person for a pretty crazy intense short-term project at work. I haven&#39;t done anything like that in a while. I&#39;ve kind of just been going along teaching and grading and writing and presenting, and I feel like I&#39;ve gotten the hang of that. It&#39;s been a while since I had to organize a *project.* I was surprised by how much I remembered from law firm days. I was a little annoyed at first because of how it took me a second to get back in the groove of it (guys, I am <i>out of the groove</i> of law firm days. RIGHT?????), but then I got my spreadsheets going and my color-coded e-mail flags organized and the whole thing worked like clockwork right to the deadline and I remembered that, actually, back in the day, I hated every second of it but I was really good at my job. Anyway, the difference between my life now and law firm life is that multiple people--not even people directly involved with my project--stopped by to tell me how impressed they were with what I was doing and they really appreciated me taking it on, etc., etc., and that was nice. TIP FOR ALL THOSE IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS: THANK YOU IS TWO WORDS, TAKES LESS THEN A SECOND TO SAY, AND MAKES UP FOR SO MUCH. I don&#39;t understand what is so difficult to understand about that.

In other other news, I am still crazy insane over &quot;Hamilton&quot; and I have a lot of thinky thoughts about how the South is always the enemy in Revolutionary tales, not England. England never even really figures in &quot;1776,&quot; the villain is Rutledge and the Southerners holding Adams hostage, and England is a little bit of comic relief in &quot;Hamilton&quot; while Hamilton has to fight his way against the Southern alliance. It&#39;s really fascinating to me. Especially in the week that we have had down here."

I have always felt like, if I&rsquo;ve done my job right, my fic *shouldn&rsquo;t* entirely stand on its own. I intend for it to be read in conjunction with a canon. I&rsquo;m doing something with the canon: commenting on it, criticizing it, hating it, loving it, &nbsp;but whatever I&rsquo;m doing, it&rsquo;s *something.* So I have always in my head felt like the best fanfic isn&rsquo;t easily serial-number-filed, if that makes sense. It should be more than changing a character name or two. Taking a fic outside of its canon conversation should, I&rsquo;ve always thought, deprive it of something. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">But even as I was tweeting this--which is a theory I have long held--I realized that my Inception experience was arguing against that. I started reading Inception fic kind of randomly, without knowing much about the movie at all. I fell in love with the fic. To this day, I&rsquo;m kind of meh on the movie. In a kind of reverse, to me the *movie* only has value because of its place in the fan conversation. Take the movie outside of its fan conversation, and it&rsquo;s deprived of full vibrancy. You don&rsquo;t get fully fleshed out characters anymore. You don&rsquo;t get one ridiculous word or look or musical cue or WHATEVER having so much significance your heart hurts. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">So maybe I&rsquo;ve been wrong to see it as a one-sided thing. It&rsquo;s not that fic needs canon. It&rsquo;s that fic and canon have a symbiotic relationship. Fic betters canon as much as canon betters fic. Which makes sense when I stop to think about it. The whole reason most people write fic is because there&rsquo;s something about canon they can&rsquo;t get out of their head, that they need *more* on, and then when you go back, everything is richer. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Which is what gets me to Derrida, I think. Derrida had something to do with referents, if I vaguely remember correctly. It was something to do with symbols not being universal because you had to know their referent? And the referent was itself a symbol and unknowable? Or something like that. As far as I could tell, modern philosophy eventually devolved into NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING EVER. ANYWAY, I really just wanted to borrow the idea of the referent. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Because I think, what&rsquo;s important in fic, is not the referent back to canon, as I&rsquo;d always thought. It&rsquo;s the referent to, for lack of a better word, *fanon.* And I don&rsquo;t just mean fanon like John loves Tchaikovsky and Eames is a secret peer, or whatever might be the fanon of your choice. I&rsquo;m using fanon to refer to&nbsp;&ldquo;the way fans communicate.&rdquo; And we, like many people, like artists everywhere, use our creativity to communicate, and it&rsquo;s a language we all understand effortlessly, because we are versed in the referent. I&rsquo;m terrible at understanding modern art (you should see me doing research when I have to have Eames talk about art, it&rsquo;s <i style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box;"">hilarious</i>), but that is largely, I suspect, because I never studied art, I never learned its language, I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s referents. The other day a student told me she commutes from Philadelphia, and I was like, &ldquo;*Philadelphia? How long does that take you???&rdquo; and she replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a three-hour drive,&rdquo; and I still don&rsquo;t know where Philadelphia is but it&rsquo;s clearly not Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She and I? We had different referents. I don&rsquo;t actually speak Southern very fluently at all. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">But I do speak fluent fanon.

And partly there&rsquo;s an illumination of the canon, but also partly it&rsquo;s just another drop in the coffee shop AU referent pool, regardless of the canon at issue. Our primary referent, actually, is fandom itself; canon is the secondary referent that we use to communicate through our primary referent. ::making up philosophical-sounding things like a pro::</p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">@elizabethminkel pointed out in our Twitter conversation that probably, for me, fanon trumps canon, and I&rsquo;ve decided that&rsquo;s true.

Because we&rsquo;re conversing in fanon terms. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Canon is presented to us with such finality. Canon is not engaging in creative play. Canon is deadly serious.&nbsp;&ldquo;HERE I AM AND HERE IS HOW IT GOES. DEAL WITH ME.&rdquo; Canon is like the closing off of doors of possibilities until there&rsquo;s only one path. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Fanon, on the other hand, is aggressively *not that.* Fanon encourages the same story to be told infinity times, basically. Fanon is an explicit acknowledgment that there is no one way to tell a story, no one way to write a character, no one ending that is inevitable, and no one gets to tell you otherwise. Fanon is about the joy of pure limitless creativity (take that, dreamsharing). Fanon is about finding your own path and letting everyone else find theirs as well. This is why you don&rsquo;t only have one AU of each type in a fandom, or one definitive post-Reichenbach fic, or one fic dealing with Mary. You get multiple because no one behaves like or would ever expect anyone else to behave like their fic is THE DEFINITIVE. I can read a fic I don&rsquo;t agree with and I know it&rsquo;s okay for me to shrug and move on to other fics. I can read a fic I adore passionately, but it&rsquo;s also okay for me to write a fic dealing with the same moment, or genre, or whatever. Whereas I am not as good at doing that when it&rsquo;s canon, because I feel slightly bullied, somehow. Like, I&rsquo;ve had a hard time post-S3 with Sherlock, because I can&rsquo;t figure out how to deal with Mary. And I&rsquo;ve spent all of this time trying to figure out and now I&rsquo;ve reached this point where I&rsquo;m like,&nbsp;&ldquo;What does it *matter,* they&rsquo;re just going to do what they want to do and we&rsquo;ll be stuck with it.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s harder for me personally to brush canon away, because even though I&rsquo;ve been a passionate fan creator for years now, I&rsquo;ve never actually felt *invited* to that. There&rsquo;s a definite hierarchy, and I&rsquo;m the amusing upstart with a pat on the head and the&nbsp;&ldquo;there, there, that&rsquo;s not what *really* happened,&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s the bloody end of&nbsp;&ldquo;Clue&rdquo; or something. </p><p style=""-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 21px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what really happened: ALL THREE POSSIBLE ENDINGS. EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE. ALL THE FANON REFERENTS EVER. Derrida. ::mic drop::</p>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Spoilers!"">&bull; I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was excited for Doctor Who to be back. I was mostly excited to have something to watch on television because television has been dull lately. But actually I really enjoyed this episode. Maybe some of that was just nostalgia. I&rsquo;ve been watching this show for ten years, so it&rsquo;s nice to have something familiar around. But I think maybe also I&rsquo;ve gotten used to Twelve? Last season was rocky for me and Twelve, but I liked him a lot in this episode. I think getting rid of Danny really helped because Twelve was much less defensive without Danny running around shouting about the army constantly.

&bull; Although when I watched the little &ldquo;Doctor&rsquo;s Meditation&rdquo; bit and it was all about war again, I was like, &ldquo;Oh, God, please let&rsquo;s not have this be all about Danny Pink or something.&rdquo;

&bull; Why is this episode called &ldquo;The Magician&rsquo;s Apprentice&rdquo;? Is Bors going to have a bigger role in the next bit?

&bull; I thought the opening was really well done. I wasn&rsquo;t thrilled to death to open in the war, but the soldier really got me on his side, and those hand mines things were CREEPY.

&bull; I no longer remember what we know and don&rsquo;t know about Davros. There&rsquo;s a possibility that that is the key to enjoying Doctor Who: making sure that you&rsquo;re casual about it, that you don&rsquo;t sit there making everything make sense. And maybe in some ways it&rsquo;s sloppy writing but here is what years of fandom has, I think, finally taught me: Canon will eventually kill you. Not just the fanfic writer, but the writer of the original piece. You will eventually collapse under the weight of your own canon. You need the ability to keep re-starting every so often, because otherwise you reach the point where everything has been done. That&rsquo;s either when you cancel the show, or when you decide to start re-writing your history. We get this impulse, we fans; this is the fanfic impulse. But it exists because with every word you write, you close off possibilities, until eventually you have no more possibilities, until eventually the only thing to do is to re-start yourself and make different choices. I think I&rsquo;m okay with that. It&rsquo;s the longest-running fictional television show of all time, or whatever. Of course it&rsquo;s drowning in its own canon.

&bull; All of that is to say that I loved this Davros plot. When the little boy said his name, I was like, &ldquo;Ooooh,&rdquo; and I thought Peter Capaldi nailed the reaction. (Of course, I was also like, &ldquo;Only one person was ever named Davros in all of time and space? Really?&rdquo;)

&bull; By this time, I think the answer to &ldquo;Where is the Doctor?&rdquo; is EVERYWHERE, ALWAYS. God, time travel makes my head hurt.

&bull; I like the Shadow Proclamation lady, she can stick around.

&bull; That snake guy was super-creepy and I loved how he was a democracy, hahaha.

&bull; I like Missy. I like the dynamic they&rsquo;re working with her and the Doctor. I think it&rsquo;s perfect. The Master has always basically been the other side of the Doctor&rsquo;s coin, and I like how this brash, abrasive Doctor has a brash, abrasive Master to go with him, and I just really love how Missy&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Dude, of course we&rsquo;re BFFs, why do you think we fight all the time?&rdquo; because that is just the best thing, it&rsquo;s so interesting, this complex push-and-pull between them. I like them. I like that Missy is basically the Doctor without all the guilty self-reflection. Because yes, of course, we don&rsquo;t want our hero randomly killing innocents like Missy does, but sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to have someone on the canvas to be like, &ldquo;Doctor, get a grip, we all have to do bad things sometimes, let&rsquo;s move on.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s also nice for the Doctor to have someone more on his own level so he can just say &ldquo;gravity&rdquo; and know Missy will pick it up. The explanation to the human companion would take so long. It&rsquo;s nice to have the human companion in there and we need the human perspective to balance the Doctor&rsquo;s alienness, but it&rsquo;s also nice to have the Doctor and Missy working as a weirdly seamless team. And what&rsquo;s great is how, in this episode, Missy isn&rsquo;t the villain. It&rsquo;s nice to have the Master on the canvas as just another character, and not necessarily the villain all the time.
&bull; And I kind of like Missy and Clara thrown together like they were in this episode. I am all for Missy and Clara kind of going around saving the Doctor from himself. I&rsquo;m okay with that. When Clara immediately was like, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both going with him, her and I,&rdquo; I was like, YES, the gang&rsquo;s all here. And I loved when they two of them were gamboling about on the invisible planet, and Clara was clearly enjoying herself, and then when the planet became visible, Clara ran over to stand by Missy so they could stand united against the new threat together. LOVE.

&bull; Clara/Jane Austen. I ship it.

&bull; I like that UNIT calls in Clara, and I liked seeing Kate again. I did think it was weird that Clara was like, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call the Doctor, let&rsquo;s not call the Doctor,&rdquo; for as long as she was. Like, all your planes have stopped in the sky? I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s gossip. But I see why they needed to delay it. Although why didn&rsquo;t she have him call and he didn&rsquo;t pick up? That would have worked, too, I think.

&bull; Clara has a motorcycle. That&rsquo;s awesome. (Did we know that? I fail.)

&bull; I like that Clara didn&rsquo;t flinch when Missy brought up Danny.

&bull; I desperately want to know what&rsquo;s in the Doctor&rsquo;s will. And I love that it got sent to Missy. Because, as the Doctor tries to explain to Clara, their relationship is so much more complex than just enmity.

&bull; I love that there&rsquo;s randomly a couple walking a dog underneath a frozen plane in a plaza sealed off by snipers and security.

&bull; &ldquo;He keeps trying to kill me. It&rsquo;s sort of our texting.&rdquo; Missy had all the great lines in this episode. Including the one about traps being her flirting. I seriously adore her.

&bull; I actually thought the thing about how not everything is about sex, but maybe just friendship, was really interesting.

&bull; Why doesn&rsquo;t UNIT kill Missy when she starts killing people? I guess they think they need information from her, but, like, Clara is really the one who finds the Doctor, when you get right down to it. I guess they thought they needed Missy, but really Missy needed Clara. Which says a lot about how well Missy really knows the Doctor. She knows some things about him way better than Clara ever will, but she&rsquo;s aware that Clara knows some things in a way Missy doesn&rsquo;t.

&bull; The Doctor thinks he&rsquo;s going to die, so he goes to some random piece of Earth where nobody knows him. Actually, for this incarnation of the Doctor? I totally buy that. He seems much less sentimental than previous incarnations.

&bull; The Doctor showing up playing an electric guitar might be when I decided to really, genuinely like Twelve. And I loved how Missy was like, &ldquo;God, here we go again with him being an obnoxious showoff.&rdquo; I also loved how Clara and Missy were kind of like, &ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; during his terrible jokes.

&bull; Clara saying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never like this,&rdquo; and Missy being like, &ldquo;Oh, you really are new, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Yeah, I actually felt like he seemed very Doctor-y during that bit, and I actually, as I said, really liked him. So I hope this Doctor sticks around. No wonder I was never so fond of him before.

&bull; I love the ongoing idea that the Doctor has a terrible grasp of time.

&bull; He introduced the word &ldquo;dude&rdquo; several centuries early. Excellent.

&bull; Something about Missy with the Doctor reminds me of Hillary and David on &ldquo;Love It or List It.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t mind me.

&bull; Okay, so, like, Clara and Missy lead Davros to where the Doctor is, which was totally predictable and in fact Clara even suggested the plane thing was a trap meant to make them call him (the only reason it made sense not to call him). Although Davros didn&rsquo;t set up the trap, I guess Davros just had a tail on Missy and Clara? And then it turned out that Bors was actually a Dalek? And Bors was around even for the Doctor&rsquo;s Meditation? So didn&rsquo;t they know where the Doctor was all the time? Why did they need Clara and Missy if they already had a spy befriending the Doctor? I would like to think the weirdness of that detail is maybe why this episode is called &ldquo;The Magician&rsquo;s Apprentice&rdquo; to point us to that? But probably it&rsquo;s just usual DW confusing plotting.

&bull; It occurs to me that for a Doctor who used to whine a lot about being all alone in the universe way back when, now he&rsquo;s got a lot of people around who he&rsquo;s known for years, like Missy and Davros. I mean, it would be nice if they were nicer people, but still, I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where he isn&rsquo;t actually as alone as he was, where there are people around who remember him, who know who he was, who can remind him of this. People around for him to send his will to.

&bull; The main thing I don&rsquo;t understand about this episode is that presumably Davros is one of those fixed points the Doctor can&rsquo;t change? I mean, I feel a little bit like if it was so easy to kill Davros and get rid of Daleks and the Time War and everything else, it should have happened ages ago? I don&rsquo;t know Classic Who so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s been spoken about before.</lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""Bullet Points!""><ul>
<li>Waaaaaaay back in January I went to Seattle for Sherlock Seattle. I intended to talk about it way sooner but I thought my panels were audio-recorded and I was waiting for them to go up so I could link to them, but I&#39;ve never seen them, so anyway, here&#39;s my recap, which is that it was an awesome time, I met some incredibly amazing people that I had great conversations with and wish I lived closer to, and I looooooved Seattle, omg. Okay, yes, the weather would make me insane, because on the morning of my fourth day I was already like, &quot;Where is the suuuuuuuuun, why is there no suuuuuuuuuuun,&quot; because I am one of those people who wilts too long without sunshine. But it was such an incredibly charming city and I loved the vibe and energy and, dude, it&#39;s got chocolate shops on, like, every single corner. WHO WOULDN&#39;T LOVE A CITY LIKE THAT? And COFFEE SHOPS. And SO MANY RESTAURANTS. With DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOOD. <a href=""http://www.skylardorset.com/my-trip-to-seattle/"">Pictures here.</a> (Yes, we actually had a few days of perfect cloudless weather and I *still* complained because what I learned is that Seattle sun is apparently naturally way weaker than what I&#39;m used to and does not register with my Mediterranean blood.)</li>
<li>I have this theory that I like new cities better when I&#39;m not living in Boston. I was living in Boston when I first went to London, and I love London a lot but I don&#39;t actually want to live in London. I mean, I&#39;d rather live in London than lots of other places, but you get the point.&nbsp;The same with San Francisco, which everyone told me I was going to adore, and to be honest, I was kind of meh on San Francisco. Like, it was fine, but I thought I was going to love it way more passionately than I did. But I was living away from Boston the first time I went to Paris, and I *adore* Paris passionately. It&#39;s telling that when I splurged on a trip for myself, I went to Paris. I would, in a heartbeat, rent a garret in Paris and hole up and write.&nbsp;And now I&#39;m living away from Boston and I went to Seattle and was bowled over by the place. So probably there is nothing intrinsic about any of these cities that I&#39;m reacting to, I&#39;m just like, &quot;OMG A CITY LOOK AT HOW LOVELY YOU ARE CITYYYYYY BUILDINGS PEOPLE OMG.&quot;</li>
<li>KtCR is painfully limping along and I am kicking myself for not having finished it before I started posting it, but I thought I had plenty of time to finish it AND THEN I STARTED NEXT BIG THING. And I meant to write an entire post about &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; and how amazing that experience was. There&#39;s a big fic in the Inception fandom called &quot;Rule Ten&quot; that only lived in LJ comments and I read it one night and got all nostalgic that that sort of LJ comment party interaction doesn&#39;t happen anymore and without expecting it I randomly started to write NBT and suddenly it was just this *thing,*&nbsp;and to this day I don&#39;t understand how every night I managed to find time to sit down and pound out 1,000 words and I don&#39;t understand how a coherent fic seemed to come out of that process but it was so amazing to go through and possibly the best writing experience of my entire life because of how astonishingly interactive it was. I&#39;ve never written a fic by crowdsourcing so much and it was so much fun and the fic was better for it. The fic was also, like, almost 300,000 words by the time it was done and had taken me several months to write during which every free moment went to writing that and now I find myself writing KtCR chapter by chapter on Sunday afternoons and it is k i l l i n g me. Remind me that I hate writing while I&#39;m posting next time I get tempted to do that! I always forget that! (Except for NBT, that never bothered me, but that was different, somehow. Probably the extent of the comment party. And also, it had no plot and was just people bantering pointlessly. That is much easier to write than KtCR, which is *so* plot-heavy.)</li>
<li>Procrastinating writing KtCR has meant that all sorts of wonderful things are getting done instead (like this blog post!). Including the start of a new original novel that I am so fiercely in love with I can&#39;t stand it. It&#39;s basically about a supernatural One Direction. That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say.</li>
<li>Seen on the side of the road here: A sign for a yard sale. I glance as I pass by. The front yard is entirely full of huge slabs of granite for kitchen counters.</li>
<li>The next town over had an art crawl. What I basically know about myself is I can spend roughly three straight weeks in this place before I get stir crazy for something other than the same four restaurants serving the same food and football. So I drove over to the art crawl, and it was pretty hilarious. Adorable. Super-charming. But so Southern. This town, for some reason, randomly has three art galleries (I say random because it&#39;s just a tiny town), and they had lovely art, so I enjoyed that. And then the rest of the art crawl was just going into people&#39;s houses. And, like, the people who owned the house were there and they had made food and you were supposed to kind of just chat with them about their lives as artists. I didn&#39;t really want to do that--I just wanted to look at art--so I fled after the first couple of houses, because I get bored with the same conversation over and over (&quot;Where are you from?&quot; &quot;New England.&quot; &quot;How do you like the South?&quot; &quot;Oh, I love it!&quot;). And that was just so typically Southern. Like, I&#39;m an extrovert and I need to have other people&#39;s energy around me and that means going out, and usually there aren&#39;t enough people here to provide me with that energy and the people that are there all want to talk to me and I want to just be like, &quot;No, I just needed one night where I didn&#39;t sit alone in my house, but I didn&#39;t want *this.*&quot; But I know that makes me the rude Yankee so I try very hard to be very receptive to their conversation, but it does mean that I usually end up leaving early and not actually terribly satisfied by the whole experience. Plus, it was super-hot and humid and I may have Mediterranean blood but my New England blood does not like trekking up and down hills to people&#39;s houses with sweat pouring down me. But the art was really quite lovely and I was glad I got to see the town because people had told me to go to it and the houses there were truly gorgeous (and I love to look at gorgeous houses, so that was nice).</li>
<li>Things this Southern town had other than the three art galleries: three hardware/automotive stores within three blocks on Main Street; a lovely old-fashioned drugstore; three florists also within three blocks (I&#39;ve found that Southern towns generally have an abundance of florists); six churches of different denominations but all with &quot;REVIVAL!&quot; signs outside of them.</li>
<li>Also, every five miles there is a Dollar General here and I have still never been inside one. I should go.</li>
<li>I can now say with authority that there are four&nbsp;things I like about this place: the coffee shop; the yoga studio; and the way cotton looks like snow. And my job. Which is the important one. </li>

"event","<lj-cut text=""My Scalia Is a BNF Theory of Jurisprudence"">I am no con law scholar, but in reading the Scalia dissents in the Affordable Care Act case and in the gay marriage case, it occurred to me that this is what seemed to be happening: 

<i>Affordable Care Act Case</i>

Scalia: The text as written in the statute is what it is. We can never know what the drafters actually intended. 
Drafters of the statute: ...Yes, we can. In fact, we can tell you--
Scalia: NO. WE CAN NEVER KNOW. WE MUST JUST GO BY WHAT IS WRITTEN THERE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW ANYONE&#39;S INTENT, EVER.

<i>Gay Marriage Case</i>

Scalia: I know the intents of all men from the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries who ever had anything to do with jurisprudence and they would hate my fellow justices and also gay marriage and also just marriage in general and if you want to know anything about what these guys were thinking, just ask me.

So it occurred to me that basically Scalia&#39;s theory of jurisprudence seems to boil down to this: It is impossible to know intent and we must only look strictly to the words as written UNLESS it has to do with someone who Scalia feels he &quot;gets&quot; on some kind of elemental level and then he knows all about intent, no worries, k? Which basically seems to me that Scalia&#39;s just running around writing Founding Fathers fanfiction at this point and pouting a lot when he gets Jossed by, say, the five other Supreme Court justices, or the majority of the American public, or Congress, or whatever. &quot;Dudes, did you guys not read my coffeeshop AU? Because pretty sure John Marshall the barista&#39;s not down with that,&quot; is pretty much Scalia&#39;s attitude.

I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of originalism, and for the first time I&#39;ve connected it in my head to fanfiction: I&#39;m not a huge fan of originalism because I am used to the understanding that a &quot;canon&quot; text can be interpreted any number of ways, and Scalia&#39;s kind of like the bullying BNF who I&#39;d basically ignore in fandom because he&#39;s clearly crazy. (And originalism always seems just as maddeningly nonsensical as any piece of fandom wank you can come across. Like, copyright&#39;s my field, and when copyright was originally set up in this country, it lasted for 28 years. Now it lasts for life of the author plus seventy years. But I didn&#39;t notice Scalia running around ranting about protecting the intent of the original copyright drafters when the copyright extension was recently challenged.)

(And do not even ask me to explain Scalia&#39;s outrage over the Supreme Court declaring something unconstitutional, considering that is actually the Supreme Court&#39;s job, as established by Scalia&#39;s problematic fave John Marshall in Marbury v. Madsion in 1803.)

Anyway, I don&#39;t do a lot of legal posting here but I felt like my Scalia as BNF theory is an important addition to constitutional scholarship and must be shared. We should probably all anticipate a new Scalia!canon!fic wherein Jefferson and Adams hang out post-coitally and exult about the fact that they can&#39;t legally get married because of how much marriage would destroy intimacy and their super-kinky sex life. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""My Fun Has Value Too Manifesto"">And, continuing on my legal posting kick, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research for various legal articles that I have in the pipeline and I have come to this conclusion re: copyright law: that is it entirely premised on The Legend of the Suffering Tortured Artist. Like, I keep reading these law and econ-based articles that keep droning on and on about how horrible the act of creation is and how nobody would ever engage in it, ever, unless there was some sort of massive financial reward at the end of it. And I want to point out that almost nobody ever gets this massive reward they think they&#39;re setting people up for. I mean, props to the people that do, but there are a ton of people who create and will never see a dime of reward for it. And all the law and econ articles are like: Well, that&#39;s stupid then, people, that&#39;s economically inefficient, go do something else with your time.

And I go from these articles to reading fan writers talking about their fanfiction and do you know what they talk about? How much FUN they&#39;re having. They talk about playing around in sandboxes; they set up challenges for people to goof around in; they write crackfics, knowing they&#39;re crackfics, with no purpose. The law and econ articles would say: What is the socially valuable purpose of your creativity? And fans would say: ...It&#39;s fun? And that would be no good to the law and econ people. There must be PURPOSE. There must be, frankly, SUFFERING for creativity to be considered to have value. 

I&#39;m writing this down explicitly because it occurred to me, just now, today, exactly how much I personally had internalized that. I mean, I always do a lot of work defending the value of fanfiction, but for a lot of years when I was younger, I thought I could never be an actual writer because I wasn&#39;t tortured enough. I actually used to think that because I enjoyed writing, it disqualified me from ever being An Artist. I had a lot of regret about that. 

And now I&#39;m like, ...WHATEVER. I mean, it&#39;s a silly thing by which to judge art, by how miserable it makes the people it came from. A lot of great art has come from a lot of really unhappy people, yes, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a prerequisite. It is, however, definitely the assumption we have used for our entire copyright system. It creeps into every judgment we make about what we call &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;illegal&quot; in the intellectual property world: Have you suffered enough for this? If you haven&#39;t, we shan&#39;t give you any rights to it. And I just wanted to note that explicitly because, frankly, I think that assumption is harmful. It&#39;s linked, I think, to the attitude I used to encounter in the law firm that we all had to be callously mistreated for a few years in order to earn the reward of partner. I feel like it&#39;s also linked to, like, fraternity hazing. What&#39;s with so much of us as a society, that we only allow value to people that we have judged to have suffered sufficiently first, to the point where we actually cause that suffering, actually build it into our legal system, actually provide rewards for it?

(I do not in any way want to devalue suffering, and my thoughts, respect, and support go out to all those suffering. I merely want to highlight that there are times when we sanction our deliberate causing of suffering in others and I find that alarming.)

If you love your chosen form of creativity, if it brings you joy and fulfillment: GOOD. Embrace those things. Life is full of enough that will deprive you of that. Never devalue yourself for doing something &quot;for fun.&quot; That&#39;s okay. Fun things can have value, too. Have a hobby that you love and don&#39;t feel bad if it doesn&#39;t make you any money. And if you put words on paper, you&#39;re a writer. Law and econ would tell you that the world has too many creative works, but personally, I don&#39;t get that. I think the world needs as many voices as it can get. I think all of the evidence tells me that, to this point, the world has never had <i>enough </i>voices. I need to hear more, from everyone, from all voices. Go forth and speak and never let anyone tell you that what you have to say has no value. 

Plus, I can never have too many coffee shop AUs. So whatever, law and econ peeps. Fandom peeps: Go forth and create. </lj-cut>"

"event","Somehow, someway, we have actually managed to defy the weird Zeno&#39;s paradox by which every chapter of this fic seemed to keep covering smaller and smaller periods of time in their lives and arrived at...the NBT finale! And eventually, somehow, someway, the finale might even <i>end</i>. (Although it&#39;s not in sight according to the page and a half of fic outline I have in front of me.)

In preparation for the day the finale might end and Next Big Thing MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A WINNER, here&#39;s where you vote, Fwitter and Fumblr! (If you haven&#39;t been reading Next Big Thing but want to be able to vote, the three chapters with the three finalist designs start at <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/3349583/chapters/9212953"">Chapter 198</a>. Yeah, I know, not a typo, CHAPTER 198 WHAT EVEN.)

"event","So, Jason thinks I'm over-reacting.  And I probably am.  But still.

Last night, I went to bed at about twenty til eleven dressed in my flannel jammies, socks, and undies.  Jason came in a little later and I woke up when he did.  Fine and good, right?  What's my point?  

Well, coming out of a weird/psychotic series of dreams about...well, some weird shit, I wake up groggily and glance at the clock and its about 2:10 am.  Three hours or so later.  I just lay there for a minute trying to figure out whats wrong.  I reach down to scratch my leg, and there are no flannel pjs.  There are also no panties.  I wake Jason up, and he's groggy and doesn't really know what the big deal is.  So, I must've taken them off in my sleep.

Yes, I understand that part.  (After fully checking the doors of my home and totally freaking about that whole incubus/succubus thing, I came gradually to the acceptance that whats simple is true and I just took off my clothes during some wierd ass dream.)  They were right there on the bed underneath me, crumpled up like I'd dragged them off and dropped them where my hand naturally lays.  What gets me--and tell me if I'm wrong here--but what really gets me, is that if I can strip in my sleep and not know about it, having at the very least, if I don't sit up, to scrunch my body and bend my legs up and stuff, what else can I/do I do in my sleep?  I mean, to everyone else, that may seem funny, but if you think about if it was you...hell, I have some freaky dreams.  Odds are I had either a weird or an erotic one and stripped in my dream so I stripped in fact.  But some of the things that happen in my dreams...not very happy, some very bad things, I do NOT want to act out.  I mean, what if I wake up one morning and somethings happened and I don't remember anything?  

I know, I know, I'm being unreasonable.  Reasonably, I didn't have to even get out of bed to get out of my pjs.  Reasonably, this whole scenario is way out there.  I would say the same things if I didn't know how bad/creepy some of my dreams get.  I mean, I sleep a lot, but I get very little rest.  Sleep, though I crave it most of the time, is not always a peaceful place, and very seldom a happy place for me to be.

And now, in the light of morning, it all seems much less scary.  I seem pretty damn unreasonable, really.  

But tonight, when I lay down to sleep...its not going to be the light of day.  Night has never been peaceful for me.  Some people love it.  I have always been just a little scared of the dark, of the night, of the possibilities that lie in both the blackness around me and my own imagination.  Ever since I was six years old, I've had terrible nightmares that don't seem any less real until the daylight comes again.  And now, now, when night comes and I just want to sleep it away, I know I'll wind up doing what I did from four (when I finally settled enough to try to sleep) to six thirty last night...I'll sleep in ten minute intervals whenever I can pull myself out of my dreams, and I'll wonder..."

Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self -- always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.

Idealists are sure that friendly cooperation is the best way for people to achieve their goals. Conflict and confrontation upset them because they seem to put up angry barriers between people. Idealists dream of creating harmonious, even caring personal relations, and they have a unique talent for helping people get along with each other and work together for the good of all. Such interpersonal harmony might be a romantic ideal, but then Idealists are incurable romantics who prefer to focus on what might be, rather than what is. The real, practical world is only a starting place for Idealists; they believe that life is filled with possibilities waiting to be realized, rich with meanings calling out to be understood. This idea of a mystical or spiritual dimension to life, the ""not visible"" or the ""not yet"" that can only be known through intuition or by a leap of faith, is far more important to Idealists than the world of material things.

Highly ethical in their actions, Idealists hold themselves to a strict standard of personal integrity. They must be true to themselves and to others, and they can be quite hard on themselves when they are dishonest, or when they are false or insincere. More often, however, Idealists are the very soul of kindness. Particularly in their personal relationships, Idealists are without question filled with love and good will. They believe in giving of themselves to help others; they cherish a few warm, sensitive friendships; they strive for a special rapport with their children; and in marriage they wish to find a ""soulmate,"" someone with whom they can bond emotionally and spiritually, sharing their deepest feelings and their complex inner worlds.

Idealists are rare, making up between 20 and 25 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers."

"event","This is wierd...you just click on colors randomly, twice, as they appeal to you, and it tells you stuff about you...and its...oddly accurate, really.

Your Existing Situation 
Willing and adaptable. Only at peace when closely attached to a person, group, or organization on a which reliance can be placed. 

Your Stress Sources 
The situation is regarded as threatening or dangerous. Outraged by the thought that she will be unable to achieve her goals and distressed at the feeling of helplessness to remedy this. Over-extended and feels beset, possibly to the point of nervous prostration. 

Your Restrained Characteristics 
The situation is preventing her from establishing herself, but she feels she must make the best of things as they are.
Willing to become emotionally involved and able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity, but tries to avoid conflict.

Feels that things stand in her way, that circumstances are forcing her to compromise and forgo some pleasures for the time being.

 
Your Desired Objective 
Needs to feel identified with someone or something and wishes to win support by her charm and amiability. Sentimental and yearns for a romantic tenderness. 

Your Actual Problem 
Depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation, or demands on her resources. This feeling of powerlessness subjects her to agitation and acute distress. She attempts to escape into a substitute world in which things are more nearly as she desires them to be."

You're complex, thoughtful and never content to skate on the surface. Chances are you veer towards being so analytical and introspective that even positive qualities can seem like faults. The truth is that you have a very perceptive, gentle spirit.

You hate chaos at work and prefer a structured environment and sometimes you feel undervalued by your boss. There's a part deep inside you that's aching to make more money.

And that's just scratching the surface!"

"event","Yesterday, I went to Indiana Beach for my company picnic.  It was pretty great, all in all.  Rode some rides, played a lot of DDR, watched a lot of DDR, ate lunch, rode some more rides.  Yeah, it was fun.  The only bad part was Frank's girlfriend was a real bitch about wanting to leave at seven or so, and the lines for the coasters were just shrinking up, so we wanted to stay.  But Frank and Tasha didn't know how to get home, since they planned on following us.  So we wound up going then.  Boo.

I looked at theknot.com and found a couple of okay dresses.  I think my biggest issue is going to be the big breasted thing again.  I really need a bra under my gown and I'm just not going to find a strapless one, but about ninety percent of the dresses I've seen are strapless.  It's Talia's wedding, so she gets to help figure this one out.

Just ordered a new DDR pad.  It's supposed to be a lot more like the arcade pads, and it'll work with both the PS2 and the Xbox.  I only have the Xbox one now, and that's kinda sucky since there's only one available DDR version right now for the Xbox.  But within a week I'll have a new pad, for only a hundred and ten bucks. :oP  Hey, if its fun, its not really a waste of money.  Not like we have any arcades within forty miles with a DDR machine in them.  Of course, for another hundred, I could've gotten the metal and hard plastic pad, but it weighs forty pounds and doesn't fold up, so it would be kind of tacky laying on my living room floor all the time.  This will work.  The buttons are supposed to be just as sensor-sensitive as the arcade, and they're raised.

All in all, now, I'm just bored out of my mind.  Need something to do, and since I'm at Jason's dads, my options are limited.  I want to go home and clean my house.  Weird, yes, but that's just me.  Or play DDR, which I didn't think to bring with me, today.  Oh well."

"event","So, I saw Tal today.  And it was good.  I mean, really, it makes me happy to be with her.  We went out for lunch and looked at her parents new house (which is really beautiful), then went back to decorate for her little brothers third birthday party.  And I really enjoyed being with her.  

And that really sucks.  I mean, people started showing up for the party, which is my cue to exit.  I've tried to be social.  I'm just not real good at it.  Not much of a joiner.  It's not that I worry what people are thinking about me or anything so mundane as shyness.  It's more of not knowing how to join in.  It makes me feel awkward when people start talking to each other and laughing and I have no idea how to do that.  I mean, I can in small-ish groups, but I just get lost in large groups.  I don't make myself known. 

And now I'm really worried about her wedding.  I thought at first it was on Saturday til I read Jim's website.  Tal and I don't really talk much, so last I heard it was just the 20th.  Now, the rehearsals the 20th, wedding is the 21st.  And not only is the wedding on Sunday, which means there's one night I'll have to stay in B-town at a hotel, but the wedding, if I picked up on it right today, is at 6 p.m. with a reception to follow.  Which means I'll be expected, as a bridesmaid, to stay in B-town til the reception is over, late into the night.  And I can't drive at night anymore.  It terrifies me, since every wreck I've ever been in has been at night, and I get tired and fall asleep at the wheel.  I should be at work at six a.m. Monday, but that's a two hour drive *at least* from B-town, so I'll wind up having to stay Sunday night and call off work Monday and drive back Monday morning. 

All in all, its three days and two nights away from Jas, which I'm not real thrilled with, but can't expect him to stay down there or call off work for someone he doesn't even really know.  And then I'll have to find a cheap motel I can't afford and get a room for two nights in a strange town.  Then call off work, which I really can't afford.  

And that's trying not to even THINK about the social aspects of this wedding.  

I'm confident...and I'm f***ing terrified."

I'm not exactly not dieting, by which I mean, I'm not eating cookies and brownies and donuts (mmm....), but I'm not taking in less than 700 calories a day.  That lasted all of five days.  Oh well.  I like me, I guess...screw the rest of the world. =)

Washed my car this morning.  That car is the first new one I've owned, and my poor Christine sacrificed her life to get me her.  Christine is a car, by the way.  But, if I'm honest, I haven't exactly treated Ernie (my current car) as good as I did Christine.  I mean, this is the first time she's had a bath in over two years...and that only happened because Jason gave her one.  I just helped. 

I'm restless.  I can't figure out why.  There's nothing I particularly want to do.  There's nothing I'm doing now that I don't want to be doing.  But I'm just not satisfied.  And I can't figure out what it would take to get there.  

Anyway, I'm going to eat at the Roadhouse this afternoon with Jas and a couple of his friends.  That should be good.  I guess.  Hmm...

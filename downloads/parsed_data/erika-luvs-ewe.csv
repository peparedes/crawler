"event","rules of flirting! ...they're actually true!


FLIRTING RULES--
Girls: When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold
Guys: automatically move closer to her. (if your stupid then you'll either say"" me too "" or you'll give her your jacket... don't)


Girls: During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder
Guys: lift her chin up and kiss her.


Guys: When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her too... and mean it.


Girls:When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat
Guys: whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers.



Now make a wish about something you would like to happen
between you and your crush....

I'll be your number one with a bullet 
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

"event","yesterday was a very bad day.  i got in a huge fight with my mom and sister who really didnt have anything to do with it.  i cant really tell you what it was about but it was awful.  i dont know about them, but i was crying so much.  then lanie im'ed me.  i told her i was sad and then she got really sad. lol.  she wanted to know so bad but i just couldnt tell her.  but thanks lanie for being there for me! i told her i was crying and then she said ""you cant!! now i am going to cry"" i wonder if she did.  she probably did because she knew i was really upset.  but i dont feel much better today.  so lets hope this doesnt ruin my trip in arizona.  
  well brandon is leaving today to umm where is yellow stone national park?  i think its in wyoming.  well thats where he went.  he'll be gone for a week and a half.  well i have to go over to my cousins today.  omg! my baby cousin is sooooo cute! if you hold him he'll point to the ceiling and go ""that! that!"" haha he cant really talk yet.  and then yesterday he walked over to me with his hands up in the air.  awwww it was so cute!!  well this is all for now!! bye!!

"event","so, sorry i havent posted in a long time.  well, these past two weeks have been so much fun.  volleyball is going good.  we have won all of our games.  i have so much fun at practice. me and steph and sandra are always laughing.  like yesterday, steph brought this picture of us when we were in 5th grade.  moe was in it too.  then sandra kept grabbing my face and singing behind these hazel eyes.  haha it was funny!  well on monday i had a game.  there wasnt enough people so me and sandra had to play both sets.  when i served, i ended up serving like 7 serves.  i served twice per set.  i didnt stretch before the game.  so while i was serving in the first set my arm started hurting really bad.  by the time the game was over, i couldnt even lift my arm.  my shoulder wouldnt let me.  so i came home and put some ice on it.  it felt better.  well today i have a game.  i think we will do well.  we have a good team.  i think people are going to have to play both sets because i know  a lot of people  who arent going to go.  well i am tired to this is all for now! tune in later!"

"event","well everyone, it is summer!  so far, i havent really done anything.   i just sleep till 1 and then get on the computer and go swimming!   but it starts getting old after about a week.  well yesterday,  i was taking out the trash and the cutest little dog came running up to me.   it was really hot so i gave him some water.  then me and my sis took it inside.  we called my mom and she said to put it in the backyard till she came home.  but, we played with it first.  it is soooooooooo cute!  it was a boy so it like my dog.  usually, my dog growls at other dogs but she seemed to like this one!  but then we put it outside.  when my mom got home, we took it to the humane society.  i felt super bad doing that.  then we i came home guess who called me? coach briseno!!! she told me that the summer vball team is having practice and they want me to join the team!  yay!  so now i am with steph, sandra, lauren, ashley, jennifer, tanya, amy and whole lot of other people!  well i guess now i am happy that caroline got me kicked off of the other one!  that team is full of girls that have never played before accept sarah, lanie, and caro.  well this is all 4 now!  tune in later!  bye!

"event","ummm this week was really fun! on monday, we had our choir rehearsal.  i was like going to faint because is was really hot and we did it like 3 times!  then on tuesday, it was our concert!  it went really well.  the dancers did awesome!  zayed went and it was funny because while i was singing, he kept looking at me and stuff so i kept laughing.  i was trying not to but it was hard. haha.  on wednesday we really didnt do anything.  in science a took a test and got a 92.  on thursday we just watched movies.  yesterday, in first period we went outside.  me, the twins,ashley,lina,alina and denisse were just sitting there and we put on lanies humongous sun glasses.  it was funny.  in ela, we watched the Oddysey.  it was okay.  me and zayed kept making fun of eric because he brought his drum sticks to school and whoever got close to touching them, he would like hit them! it was halarious.  but then mrs. enriquez told us to be quiet.  in math i took a test.  i wouldve gotten a 100 but i put the wrong letter!  i knew the answer but i though it was a letter that it wasnt.  ugh! so i got a 95!  oh well.  then in lunch, i sat with gabby, nathalie, lina, ana, sam, and estefania.  they kept arm wrestling!  nathalie played stephen and he beat her bad!! haha. then i played lina. it was hard but i beat her!  then in science, we did this like experiment with different powders.  everyone kept tasting one because they thought it was lucas.......but it was really centric acid. hahahahahahaha.  i told them and they were like OMG!  lol!  then in choir, we watched shark tale.  i love that movie.  i like the part in the beginning when the worm is flying into the water! he is so cute! then in tx. history, we watched the Patriot.  it was kind of graphic but i guess it was okay.  it was really like bloody and stuff.  i dont really like movies like that.  after school, i came home and just watched tv.  i was home alone for like 6 hours! it was kind of creepy because it was like 11:30 at night! and my dog kept barking at the backyard and my window kept creeping.  but to take my mind off of that, i watched a cinderella story.  the guy is really hot! and i love that movie but i hate hilarry duff.  then this morning my mom got mad at me because i was still asleep at 1:30.  but i was really tired.  she said that in the summer she is going to wake me and andrea(my sis) up at 10 every morning!  THAT IS SUPER EARLY!  when we told her that she told us that we had to get up to do chores!  isnt that super retarded!  well there is only 5 days left of school. i am kind of sad because some people are leaving.  TO ALL MY FRIENDS:

THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!  I COULDNT HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH THIS YEAR WITHOUT YOU.  IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME COMING TO THIS SCHOOL WITH EVERYONE HAVING THEIR OWN GROUPS.  BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PART OF THEM.  I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE FRIENDS NEXT YEAR AND THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL.  I LOVE YOU GUYS!

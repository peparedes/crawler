I can't be sure, but, by the way it looks, when I'm in your grace, my tongue refuses to articulate, and my mind scrambles to over-compensate.  I end up stumbling over a few trite words that lack any eloquence I may or may not posses.  Even online... even when I'm hiding behind a computer, I can't grasp words.  If words and expressions were tangible I'd just hand them to you to interpret and do with as you please.  I'm lacking something that makes people witty and interesting; I wish I knew what.
  
I'm nervous, but I'm not sure what I'm nervous about.
The more I try to avoid hesitation, the longer it takes me to act.

This, however, in reality, is not the case. I have not confided in any one of my friends.  Any one, save Kim. Why is that? The truth is that, as horrible as it sounds, I know Kim would be the only person to take me seriously.  I am blessed by my friends, but they wouldn't take me seriously.

"event","So here's what I've come up with so far:

Relationships are like shirts.  Allow me to explain.
Sometimes... you find a shirt that's pretty on the rack, but once you put it on, it doesn't really fit right, so you take it off.

Sometimes... you find a shirt that fits perfectly, that you're comfortable in, so you never want to take it off.

Sometimes... the shirts you wear to much get holes in them because the fabric isn't strong enough, so as much as you liked it, you have to take it off.

Sometimes... shirts fit well but are too tight around the neck and you can't breath when you wear them, so you try to unbutton them alittle.

Sometimes... shirts that are tight around the neck don't have buttons, so as hard as you try and as much as you want it, you eventually have to take it off.

I thought I was in love, but maybe I just don't know the difference between love and comfort.  I wrote a text message one night... and it said ""Thank you so much.  I love you."" I didn't send it.  I didn't have the guts.  It's a little ironic to know that he may have been thinking the same thing. I just wish my shirt had buttons.  I would have loved to undo a few buttons before I took it off and some other girl put it on.  Well, to me, it was unbuttoning a few buttons, and I loved it.  I loved being IN a relationship and not bound to a relationship.  But as it turns out, I wasn't in the relationship, I only thought I was, because to him, I wasn't unbuttoning, I was taking it off.  That, of course, was my fault. 

I'm not going to ask to put it back on... mainly because he'd say no. He made that quite clear the other night. Also because I'm inconsiderate, but not THAT inconsiderate.  I deserve this.  I deserve this.  I really, really deserve this. Love. Damn. Love. Love. Do I really deserve this?

I'm sorry, love.  I hope you read this and know that you've impacted someone as much, no, more than they've impacted you.  Love.  I know I deserve this."

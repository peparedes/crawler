"event","The last two days have been what I would call firecracker days. Moments bursting with beauty and a gentle excitement that leave you saying just ""Ohhh"" and ""Ahhh"", but a few duds were you sit and hold your breath as you look up to the sky to waiting to see a big blossom of glitter and lights sparkle only to watch as it fizzles down to earth with a sigh of disappointment, and then moments when firecrackers start exploding all over the place causing your heat to skip a beat and your ears to ring and excitement turns to fear waiting for the next moment trying not to be caught by suprise. yes. it has been like that lately. but it has also featured an assumed frog turning into prince for one moment to come and rescue my flip-flop adorned feet from out of the rain and mud and carry me home, villians trying to tie princesses to train tracks and being unsuccessful, my reflection telling me, ""You're not the fairest of them all."", songs that cry for me, the pink-brick road to the ruby city began to pave itself and dreams of a trip to Oz to see Lolita. I wish DeDe would/could come then both my sissies will be there, but alas.
I don't know what to do with myself really. I am disappointed in my current crushes even though I shouldn't be because I want to leave and well you know."

"event","I am headed for Oz soon to visit Lolita so she can do my portfolio. We are going to have a real hollywood adventure, I can feel it. I can't wait to put my hands in Marilyn's, Judy Garland's, Bette Davis and all the princesses of hollywood. I am gonna dye my hair pink though and Lo and the angecies will just have to deal. Not all the way pink just streaks like I used to have. I can't wait to cruise the steets with my tinkerbell sunglasses on snapping pictures left and right! I have been to LA, but never to Hollywood, just to Anahiem actually to visit and hang out a disneyland (wich I will be going to again!). I am nervous about doing my portofolio just because my body isn't what it was when I was 17 and scouts were actually interested in me, but working out should help and hopefully I will be in shape in a month. Ugh! I hate talking about things like that. NEway, I have looked into agencies in the ruby city and have my eyes set on one I am also keeping competitions in mind and stuff. I have thought about having dirty pink make me a website complete with fairy dust and seductive incensce to lure scouts and agencies but we'll see. I have yet to tell him about the ruby city because I don't want to jinx it."

"event","i wasn't really listening to her talk, i was watching her talk.

i fell in love with steph because she was alice. because she said to me as we set watching lights explode so close we could reach out and touch them, ""I wish I was a firecracker. So someone would love me.""

but why did i fall in love with you? with her? maybe because she is this strange beautiful doll. with big empty eyes and a mess of blonde hair. because you always stare off into nothing, because you are always chewing on your acrylic nails. because you call just to ""make sure i am not mad at you."" or because i forgot something at your house like i won't be there tomarrow.

being next to you is slow torture. being away from you is to. that is why i am going so far away from you. out of sight out of mind. the ruby city is were i will find someone like me and i can set you free and set myself free too."

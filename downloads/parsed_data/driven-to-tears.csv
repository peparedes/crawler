<br>my N'sync cd was in my player that you felt so welcome to help yourself to and i wasn't planning on listening to the rest of my cd collection anytime soon so i'm hoping they treat you well.
<br>i would've just given you the gum and candy if you had been polite enough to ask, and my zippo was almost out of fuel anyway. 




...there's nothing wrong with staying posi, right?"

i hope you got my package today, 
it was supposed to arrive on sunday.

or you'll be eating them with a spoon :)
i hope you like the blanket i made you,

...daniel is a dumb shit. 
heath is a nazi.
senior yeas has been great and the high school years are coming to an end.
after i look through all the previous posts about all the stupid shit i've done, it makes me realize how much i'v grown up, how much i've been through, and how many priceless moments that i've shared with the people most important in my life.

school has been great, aside from all the teachers i've disliked, and all the mornings i've felt like i couldnt possibly roll out of bed. but its time for a new chapter in my life. time to put away the three ring binders, all the pens that were almost out of ink anyway, and those stupid color diargams from human bio.
its time to grow up kids &&I'M STOKED."

"event","It took me so long to get over you.
Im not completely there yet.
But almost.
I dont think about you daily anymore.
My heart doesnt sink when i think about you with someone else.
And i dont really have an awkward hatred towards you anymore.
But when i do think about you,
All of the memories we had feel sort of unreal,
Almost like the life is slowly fading out of them.
It has been so long since i have seen you.
You almost seem unreal too.
I want you to know that you changed everything about me.
The way i think.
The way i feel.
Everything.
I have grown up.
Having my heart broken was a horrible feeling,
But not knowing if it was ever going to stop, was even worse.
And even with all of the pain you caused me,
I dont regret any of it.
Because pain wasnt the only thing you ever brought.
You are the only boy that has ever taken my breath away.
I got butterflies with every kiss you ever gave me.
Our inside jokes always made me smile.
And i always felt so safe in your arms.

But now that it is all over,
I know what i am looking for now.
I need to find someone who will make me feel the way you did.
Someone who can take my breath away,
Give me butterflies,
And make time stand still.



<b>Im Writing This For You.
Not myself, 
Or anyone else that might read my stupid thoughts and my stupid feelings, 
And the stupid meaningless things that i do from day to day.
Im writing this for you,
Because i know you will read it.<b>"

"event","Love is a silly thing.
It creeps up on you when you least expect it.
Once you realize you have it, it gets ripped out from under you.
Your left scrambling to pick up the pieces, before everything else comes crashing down.
And it hurts more than anything you could ever imagine.
It leaves your heart feeling bruised, but curiously numb at the same time.
It leaves you writing letters.
Letters that spill out every emotion that your feeling.
Letters that you don't even intend on giving to the person they were written to.
Even though you wish they could read every single word, just so they would know how much agony they caused you. 
It hurts the most to think of how much you trusted this person with your heart. 
Because in the end, you find out that they really had no idea at all, what to do with it."

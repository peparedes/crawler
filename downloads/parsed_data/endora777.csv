Last night, glancing around my living room and reminiscing, he said &quot;There are a lot of good memories in this house.&quot;&nbsp; Yes, old friend.&nbsp; Indeed.&nbsp; You created some of them.&nbsp; And now my world is a lesser place without you in it.

Rest well in the arms of the Mother, my brother.&nbsp; Rest well."

"event","A week from tomorrow is my 30th high school reunion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;was planning on making something to wear for the event.&nbsp; It's been a while since I've made myself anything spiffy and it seemed to be as good an excuse as any.&nbsp; I was planning on making some kind of artsy fartsy wearable art type vest.&nbsp; It just wasn't forthcoming.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have to be able to get a three dimensional image fixed in my mind before I&nbsp;can start hacking away at any fabric, nevermind $20/yard silk.&nbsp; So it turned into an artsy fartsy jacket.&nbsp; It still wasn't forthcoming.&nbsp; So it became an artsy jacket.&nbsp; But the really cool lines I&nbsp;designed into the jacket just were not working out with the fabric and my body.

So I&nbsp;recut and resewed and stomped my foot just a little.&nbsp; I'm going to have a really nice black dupioni silk jacket.&nbsp; It's not artsy, it's not stupendous, but it IS a nice lined silk jacket."

"event","Well, I&nbsp;FINALLY finished putting up all the apples from our not-really-impressive sized suburban granny apple tree that previously hadn't really produced much.&nbsp; It was three days worth of work and I&nbsp;am hot and tired.&nbsp; There's nothing like canning with a hot water bath all day to really heat up your house.&nbsp; I've still got 8 pounds of raw apples left for munching on.

This year I&nbsp;have really gotten into the harvest spirit.&nbsp; I'm mabon-y all over with my eyes set&nbsp;toward samhain.&nbsp; (It will be an open ritual this year for samhain.&nbsp; Let me know if you're interested in attending.&nbsp; Friday, Oct. 31 from noon to whenever.)&nbsp; Since lughnasahd I&nbsp;have produced the following:

13 quarts of my almost world famous marinara sauce
8 half pints of blueberry jam
9 pints of peaches in syrup
8 pints of creamed corn
7 pints of apples in syrup
8 quarts of frozen apples for pies
10 pints of apple butter
6 pints of apple sauce

Many prayers and blessings went into each and every jar.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single unused mason jar left in the house...and I&nbsp;had already went out and bought an extra case of jars!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Put a fork in me folks.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am DONE, DONE, DONE!"

"event","This year has been the fruit year in our backyard.&nbsp; We got several pints of blueberries, a handful of exquisitely tasty, tiny plums, a single pear, and about 2 bushels of granny smith apples.&nbsp; I&nbsp;always thought those gizmos for peeling apples were silly looking and not much faster (if not downright slower)&nbsp;than peeling apples by hand.&nbsp; Now into day 2 of coring, peeling, and quartering those apples, all I have to say is &quot;Holy crap was I wrong!!&quot;.&nbsp; My right thumb and forefinger are covered in layers of bandaids, acting like a thimble.&nbsp; My hands and wrists are&nbsp;starting to ache.&nbsp; 

R and I leave in a week and a half&nbsp;for the first real vacation we've had in years.&nbsp; The last time I&nbsp;was in Connecticut was to be there for my mother's cancer surgery.&nbsp; (Two years clear and clean now!)&nbsp; So I'm really overdue to visit.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also need to visit my grandparents.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; At 48 years old I&nbsp;still have 2 living grandparents.&nbsp; Ain't that a great blessing?&nbsp; Anyway, so when I&nbsp;discovered that my high school class was having a 30 year reunion, I&nbsp;debated on going. 

My senior year was a nightmare and I&nbsp;couldn't wait to get the hell out of the little&nbsp;town I&nbsp;grew up in.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never really fit in&nbsp;in high school and really didn't come into my own until my college years.&nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't seen or heard from a single one of the people I&nbsp;graduated high school with since June of 1978.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can barely remember any of the names and faces.&nbsp; But as I&nbsp;started sifting through some of the entries on classmates.com, I started remembering...a little anyway.&nbsp; I'm actually getting pretty excited about the reunion.&nbsp; It may be a total waste of time, and if so, it's only for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; It also may be a real trip too.&nbsp; My father gave me the best warning about high school reunions so far.&nbsp; He said &quot;You'll be shocked to see how many old people show up.&quot;&nbsp; Thanks Dad, you old fossil you! 

Well I'd best get back to these freakin' apples.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;don't finish soon and get my butt up to my sewing room this weekend, I'll be going to my high school reunion naked.&nbsp; Boy won't&nbsp;THAT be the talk of the reunion!&nbsp; LOL"

We need someone to actually stay at the house.&nbsp; It doesn't have to be all day long 24/7.&nbsp; The dogs can be left alone for hours at time.&nbsp; But we do want someone to stay overnight in the house with them.&nbsp; R and I are also very willing to pay for someone to live in our house and tend the pets while we're gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spooky said to add:&nbsp; and throw the ball!

We've got someone lined up to&nbsp;keep the dogs over&nbsp;at their new house, but they are in the process of buying&nbsp;that new house and things are kinda crazy, as they always are with a house closing.&nbsp; I really, really need to buy the tickets before they become more expensive and less available.&nbsp; And before I lay out $600 for non-refundable plane tickets, I want to be sure I have a plan B firmly in place just in case things fall apart.

We&nbsp;will be leaving either Thursday, Sept. 18th or Wed. Sept. 17th, and returning Wed. Sept. 24 or Thurs. Sept. 25.

Anyone interested in serving as first back-up on this?&nbsp; Anyone interested in a similiar gig at another time?"

"event","&nbsp;The bad news is that R's ""benefit"" package is total crap.&nbsp;&nbsp; His employer gives him the opportunity to&nbsp;BUY really crappy health insurance...at a price we really can't afford to pay AND&nbsp;begin to pay off our debts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing they really give him is a whopping...sit down for it...$10k life insurance policy.&nbsp; That TOTALLY sucks ass.

On the good news scope, yesterday R was promoted to Charge Nurse...on the homicidal-maniac unit and the kicked-out-of-every-other-unit unit.&nbsp; Yes boys and girls, R is now the weekend Big Kahuna of the Looney Tunes Bad Boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the head of nursing heard some glowing reports about R's work and has been impressed with R's suggestions for the unit, some of which he has implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's because crazy or no, the patients see that look in R's eyes and they become afraid...very afraid.&nbsp; *G*&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a wee bit more money with the promotion, though not enough to make up for the&nbsp;suckage of a&nbsp;benefits package.&nbsp; The staff tells him that that is the quickest path to increased pay with this corporate owned facility.

Career wise, R's finding a nice niche to specialize in.&nbsp; With a couple of years of specialized experience, he'll be quite nicely marketable."

"">It's been a wicked two years, but we're there. For 2 years, since the sheet metal union has been giving him only about 4 months of work a year, R has been working on going back to nursing. He found a government re-training program to pay for the tuition and cover a lot of the expenses like physical exams, inoculations, uniforms, stethoscope, etc. He ended up at a health education school in Gainesville. What a goatfuck! The program is supposed to consist of 40 hours of class time (which can be done as a self-study) and 160 hours of clinical practicum, which means working as a nurse without being paid. That's five weeks time. The tuition was paid in early August and R was given the self-study text. Within 10 days he was ready to take the exam and start the practicum. It took them 3 weeks to give him the test (on the phone no less) and they didn't start his practicum until the very end of DECEMBER, during which time he had to turn down several union jobs so he could be ""available"" to start the practicum. Nobody understood what the state requirement were, and they kept changing them. Every couple of weeks they added a new hoop to jump through, some of which were contradictory and made absolutely no sense at all. It was nightmarish. He finally finished the practicum and got his license at the end of February; seven MONTHS after he paid the tuition. </div><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""After a long job search with a brief union job or two thrown in the middle, R is now  employed full time as a psychiatric nurse.  He's working for a private psychiatric facility near the airport."">After a long job search with a brief union job or two thrown in the middle, R is now employed full time as a psychiatric nurse. He's working for a private psychiatric facility near the airport. He came home after one of his orientation days with a big grin on his face, held up the lanyard (a special break-away one so patients can't strangle him with it) with his new ID and keys, and announced that they had given him the keys to all the rooms and to all the straitjackets. <br /><br />The ""clients"" at the hospital run the gamut from alcohol/drug rehab to homicidal maniacs; appropriately delegated to various units, depending on the degree of crazy there is. They told him he would be working the mostly-rehab-with-a-few-crazies unit, but apparently a lot of people called in sick over the weekend and they ended up putting him in the batshit-crazy-and-potentially-dangerous-mixed-in-with-a-few-harmless-droolers unit. Apparently they thought R is very good with the scary-crazies. ... Who's surprised? Show of hands. <br /><br />He works 12 hour day shifts on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, gets paid an extra 4 hours every week, gets a weekend shift differential, an after 8 hours in a day differential, and of course, time and half for anything over 40 hours. Full bennies, paid holidays/vacation. Only 3 days a week to burn gas getting to work, and 4 days off in a row every week. <br /><br />This works REALLY great for us. During the past couple of years, we've had a LOT of 24/7 time together. Got used to it actually and we really missed it during the few times when the union DID have work for R. We don't go out all the often, and when we do, we just as well prefer to avoid crowds. We'd always prefer a restaurant mid week rather than weekend. On the other hand, it does mean that we are pretty much unavailable all the time for anything on a weekend. <br /></div><br />It's been a long strange trip. Many a time we were at our wit's and/or finances' end. Each time something amazing would happen to enable us to go on. The number of bizarre coincidences along the journey are too numerous to list, and some rather hair raising. Each and every time we came close to giving up on hope, a light shown down the correct path to guide our way. Any time we took a wrong direction, things blew up so that there was only one path to take. I'm grateful that we both pay attention to such things. Our gratitude goes out to all those who helped us in various ways to get through these past couple of crappy years. Candles have been lit in thanks</span></font></font>"

"event","Sorry i haven't updated in a while i have been pretty busy.. Plus no one comments anymore so if your reading this please comment... It would make my day..

So its about 12:45 on saturday night and i just came upstairs to get ready for bed.. I babysat tonight i got 26 bucks which rocks other then the fact that i owe my parents like 20 dollars... I also went shopping today with camille which was really fun.. I love camille shes the shit.. Friday i went to the movies with Rachael and we saw Jersey Girl which was pretty good... I like movies like that.. Those sentimental ones that just make you sit back and sigh... Rachael and i had a good time....

So let me think of something interesting to talk about so that you guys can comment on it..  Okay i thought of something.. The weather.. I think it is sooo nice outside.. I love it because at like 9 o'clock you can walk outside and it feels good.. You aren't freezing your ass off or anything.. Im so ready for summer to be here.. Spring Break is next week... Yayayay.. I think im going to Hilton Head which is going to be really really cool if i do get to go.. Im not going to be able to bring a friend buts thats okay i will stil have fun.. We are only staying 2-4 days so i will be able to come home and chill with my friends.. Thats also the fun of Spring Break.. Its like one giant weekend.. I can't wait.. Also with the weather warming up it is time to go out and get some new summer clothes.. My parents gave me 50 dollars today to go to the mall and i got my bathing suit and a shit and a skirt.. I love shopping for summer... It makes me want summer really bad.. Well i hope i haven't bored you..

"event","Okay so this weekend was really busy.. Friday Rachael and Camile spent the night at my house and a ton of people came over.. First it was David Wood then Drew and Johnathan.. Then Max and his crew and then David Drew and Johnathin again.. While max was here we went out side and was playing music in this guys car and it was loud so of cource we got yelled at.. I hate my neighbors i think that they could be a little bit more nicer then to just come out and start yelling at us and giving us attitude.. Thats the thing that really pisses me off.. Ok the guy that came over and yelled at us was mike and he attomatically comes out and is like ""turn that of, i have little kids sleeping, im gonna call the cops"".. I think that if he would have come out and just said you know would you please just turn the music down my kids are trying to sleep and actually treated us half way decent we would have been happy to turn it down.. But no he had to be an asshole about it and noone was being respectfull to him because he had a bad attitude in the first place.. My parents have always told me that i need to respect people and to treat people like you would want to be treated and i try to do that.. Why doesn't that go for adults also??? I think that i would be much more respectfull to someone that showed me respect then someone that just saw me as a stupid little teenager.. If someone wants me to respect them then i want them to respect me.. Is that so much to ask??"

Hes here for the weekend and im really excited needless to say.. Hes a cool kid..  Were going to go to the mall to see camile and the gang so that michael can meet everyone.. It shall be fun..

So last night camile and rachael spent the night at my house and a lot of people came over to see us.. Max and his people came over and we got yelled at by my neighbor because the music was too loud.. Whatever they suck.. Then david wood came over with drew and this other kid.. They had come once before.. It was so much fun.. I love it when people come over to see me it makes me feel like people care about me.. Its fun.. My parents got a little pissed because me were loud and shit... Oh well it was a kick ass night..

So lately i have been thinking.. I started hanging out with the ""punk"" kids at lunch and i really like it.. They are cool people.. I don't really fit in with all of them but they treat me like anyone else.. Camile and i both started eating lunch with them and since then i have been hangingout with them.. Okay well i have to go and talk with my mom..Bye

"event","Right now i am sitting here thinking about doing my homework but not doing it...  Today i got my mid-term sheet that tells us what we are getting.. I got mine from Mr. Sacco my biology teacher.. I have a 68 in his class.. Yes a 68... I hate this man with every bone in my body.. I don't think he looks at me as a real student.. Just someone thats sits there and fails everything.... This is great.. Im failing a major class which means that if i don't pass it then i will have to either take it in summer school or some back next year as a sophomore again.. Sounds like great fun..  My goal is to get my grade at least up to a C if not a B... A B would really be nice because then i wont get bitched at by my parents.. I highly dought that getting a b will happen but i will set my goals high..

So other then that i had a good day.. I have found out over the years that i don't tlet a lot of things bother me.. Yes i am failing but am i going to let that ruin my entire day.. Hell no.. I usually think that i have a good attitude towards everyone.. At least i try to anyways.. I don't let the little things get to me that much.. I think that if you let the little things get to you then your very unhappy and you kinda make things bad for yourself.. Okay well i guess i better go and do that Biology homework..

"event","Sorry i haven't updated in a while i have been surprisingly buisy... Im grounded right now though so i have time to update.. I lied to my parents.. Not the greatest thing in the world to do.. And i kept lying so now im in a ton of shit.. I could have gone and hung out with camile today but i couldn't because my mom was being the biggest bitch in the world.. Oh well... All i have to do is get through this weekend and next weekend i can go out and do stuff...

Max and Bone came and saw me last night which was really cool of them because they knew that i couldn't go anywhere so they decided to come and see me.. They were going to go Ice Skating and i would have gone but NOOOOOO my moms a big bitch..

This weekend STARZ is having a free movie weekend which kicks ass because all of my favorite movies are on.. I have watched Sweet Home Alabama like 3 times and Thumbelina twice... I love free movie weekends.. They should have them all the time.. 

So morgan told me that she went to go see FAME the musical at our school.. She said it was really good and that i should go but im not sure if my parents are going to let me... I think that the productions at our school are pretty good.. Im in concert chorus and i think Mr. Dove does really good with the musicals and everything.. He definatly knows what he is doing.. Hes a pretty nice guy also.. I called morgans cell phone last night while she was watching FAME and her purse started vibrating because her phone was in her purse.. I thought about that after i dialed the number but i knew that she was smart enough to either turn the volume down or put it on vibrate.. Sorry morgan i'll never do it again.. :) 

Tomarrow is Sunday and i think im going to go to church with camile again.. I really liked it.. Its just youth group and i don't even go to that church but it gives me something to do.. And it doesn't hurt to show my parents that im going to church either.. 

Lately my parents have been really mean towards me.. Like everything that i do i get yelled at for.. I can't say a sentence with out one of them yelling at me or making fun of me.. Like today i wanted to watch Aladin on tv.. But nooooooo my mom had to make a big deal about me wanting to watch a cartoon.. Who gives a shit.. Its a cartoon no big deal.. And then last night i went up to Gate to get a doughnut and i only had one so the guy gave it to me free.. I was really excited.  I mean i know that they are only 33cents other wise but i was still excited.. I come home and tell my mom about it and she trys to make up some sorrta reason for him to give me it.. I was like mom he was just being nice.. GOD.. stop overanalizing everything.. Shes really being a bitch right now.. Oh well i don't really look foreward to school but anything to get me away from her..

"event","Okay well this weekend was really cool..  But also really sucked.. I hate fucking narks!!  People really piss me off.. What is the point of people telling your parents everything???  I mean come on why the hell do people feel the need to do this shit... Sorry this just really pisses me off..

Other than that though my weekend was pretty good.. Camile and i hung out a lot.. shes really cool.. She might be going with me to Hilton Head for Spring Break..If my parents will let me.. 

School is okay right now.. Im going pretty good... Sacco is still weird but whatever i will just have to get over it i can't really do anything about it.. Coach Pendravis's class is kinda weird becuase i keep making bad grades which really sucks because i am trying.. But i hope i do get better grades soon..

I filled out my job applications on Sunday and i droped them off on Monday so i hope that someone will call me because i really need a job.. If anyone knows someplace that i can get a job i would really like it if you would tell me... Okay well i gtg..

"event","So today is Wednesday and so far this week is going really well..  Sunday i had a great day i am now 16 which is awesome.. I have been out job searching and i haven't had any luck yet but im not going to give up.. Sorry its been a couple days since i last updated i have been pretty busy... 

Lately i have been thinking of new ways to be different.. Like i try different things with my room to try and make it nicer.. Like tonight morgan and i tryed to make little stars to hang from my ceiling with glitter on them... They look okay not the best but im going to keep them up there because i think that having stuff on your walls is cool...

In Saccos class we are learning about DNA.. And on Tuesday we just kept asking him questions and what not.. I asked about.. Genetic Engineering and how he feels about it.. If you don't know its about when people can change their kids.. Like if they wanted them to be a better basket ball player they could pay 10 thousand dollars and their kids would be a better basket ball player.. I think that if you have a disease in your family and you find out that the kid has it also then you can change that.. But using it just to make your kid smarter or to change it.. I think thats wrong.. I mean you are making it be something... How would you like it if when you were born you had to have certain things that you HAD to do because your parents payed for you to be good at it.. It just doesn't make sence to me.. Just because we have the power to do that doesn't mean we need to..
I gtg the OC is on in 15 minuters.. Thanks for reading

"event","So today is Friday and we are out of school because of the snow.. Im sick which sucks because my birthday party is tomorrow and i better feel better by then.. I like the snow.. I think it is soo pretty.. I hate the fact that with the prettyness comes cold.. But i will get over it.. My neighbor called the District Office yesterday and they said that we don't have to make up Thursday.. But you never know they might change thier minds later..  

My dad just asked me if i wanted to change my birthday party to next weekend because im sick and we don't know if all the snow is going to melt by tomorrow.. I said no.. If i have to i will have my birthday party while i am sick.. I mean you only turn 16 once in your life...

Yesterday we went to school just long enough to disect a rat.. Ours was a girl and she had babies.. It wasn't as gross as i thought it was going to be but it was gross.. Mr. Sacco and i don't get along.. He doesn't like me because i don't get good grades on his tests.. But im still passing so im happy.. Whenever i try and ask him a question he either just doesn't answer it or he finds someway to make me look like a total idiot.. Which he succedes in doing most of the time.. Him and i just don't get along.. 

So i was talking to Morgan last night and she said that she wanted to go to school because their prolly going to make us make up this snow day over Spring Break.. I was thinking and if my parents already have something planned then i think that they might just take us out of school anyways.. I mean it is not that big of a deal.. I mean what are they going to teach us on a Monday when they aren't going to see us for another week.. Oh well... I just plan on not missing anymore school so that my parents will take me out of school.. Okay well im gonna go and watch somemore tv.. Thats the thing i love about snow days.. You can't really go anywhere so you are forced to watch tv all day..

"event","So right now i am talking to Rachael about my birthday party which i want to have saturday and it isn't looking great right now.. First idea was to go to celebration stations and ride the go karts and everything but thats going to be like 20 bucks per person and thats a lot.. Now i want to go to laser tag but my mom is being a total bitch about everything.. God, i thought this was going to be really easy and fun but now its just being a pain in the ass.. I am still going to do something im just not sure what exactly yet....

Okay well school lately is school.. I don't feel so great right now.. I have a really sore throat.. I don't want to miss any school though so i will tough it out.. Mr. Sacco doesn't like me and i am really starting to get pissed at him.. I wish he would just leave me alone.. I know that i don't do well on his tests but god does that give him the right to totally ignore everything i have to say.. I try to ask him a question and he just walks away.. Stupid ass.. We have this newsletter thing due on Monday and i haven't even started it.. I asked him about it and he just looked at me and gasped.. ""omg you haven't started"" noo asshoe i haven't because i can't think of a topic that you would approve of... God sorry i had to get that out of my system..

Okay well im off to planing my birthday party..

"event","So today is Saturday and i am soooo happy it is.. This week went by kinda fast but just the simple fact that school was really beginning to suck... School is just getting old.. This semester just really sucks and i am failing a couple of my classes which i never do.. I have never failed a class... NEVER.. So my parents are doing everything that they can possibly do to make my life hell because im getting a bad grade.. I hate it when parents do that they ground you.. Don't let you go out on the weekends because your grades are bad.. That isn't going to make me do my homework or study.. Its just going to piss me off even more..

Okay well off of the bad grades... Other then grades my life is going pretty good.. I have a really cool group of friends and they are the shit.. I can always call them up and talk to them.. Lately i have been hanging out with Rachael i think shes the shit.. 

I read a journal entry the other day and this girl was just tired.. Tired of school and just tired of life.. I TOTALLY agree with her.. Right now for me everything is just the same.. I get up go to school, come home, eat dinner, watch tv, do homework, and go to bed... Every single day of my life.. Saturday and Sunday i usually chill with my friends and everything but life right now is just getting old.. I wish i could just change something and then i would have something new to do everyday.. I should get a job.. Yeah, i will look into that..

"event","So today is Sunday and its 1:27pm and im still haven't taken a shower or gotton ready.. I think today will be one of those days where you just hang around the house in your pj's all day and watch movies and eat.. I love days like this.. I don't have to be anywhere or doing anything i can just hang out and do nothing all day.. 

This weekend has been pretty good.. Friday i spent the night at Rachaels and we had a awesome time.. She the shit.. Then Saturday night i went over to diana's house and watched some movies and eat pizza... So basically all weekend i have done nothing.. But i like doing nothing.. 

So yesterday was Valentines day and my dad got me 2 red roses which was very nice of him.. He got my mom some flowers also.. Hers were better then mine.. Oh well she deserves it because she puts up with all of or shit all the time.. 

Lately i have been thinking and i am really close to my mom.. I tell her a lot.. I mean not the things that she really doesn't need to know.. But if i have a bad day at school i can always come home and tell her about it.. She might be a bitch and tell me to get over it.. But thats just her.. She just understands me.. She knows that she isn't perfect and that no one is.. She just tells you like it is.. Sometimes that is really bad because you just want her to tell you that everything is going to be okay and that everything will work out.. Yeah she wont. She will tell you what you need to do... She tells you straight off.. It kinda sucks sometimes but i would have to say shes my best friend because she does tell me what i need to do and she tells me ""thats life"" and to get over it.. I hope that when im older and am out on my own that i can still call her and talk whenever i need to.. Some people aren't very close with their moms.. I didn't used to be but for some reason i am now.. Oh well hopefully our relationship will always stay like this..

Elisa told me that we might get some snow or something today.. But im not sure.. The sky is grey but the sun keeps poping out every once in a while.. Plus i think that if we miss another day it will come out of our Spring Break and that would really suck.. So i hope we do go to school tomarrow...

I went to the mall yesterday and as i was walking around every store has their new spring clothes out and bathing suits... I wish it was summer.. I am really sick of the rain and this cold as hell weather.. I just want to go sit by the pool for hours.. I love having air conditioning.. To walk into a house that is air conditioned and its really hot outside.. Its great.. Okay well i think im going to go and see whats playing on HBO..

"event","Today was pretty good.. Just a normal day at school nothing big happen to me.. This weekend was okay not the best i've ever had... So Valentines day is coming up on Saturday and to be perfectly honest with you.. I hate valentines day.. All the girls get their stuff from the guys that like them and everyone is so happy and OMG look what he got me and everything.. I have never had a boyfriend on vanlentines day and i have never had anyone get me anything that was really meaningfull.. My friend and i have bought those carnations for eachother so that we don't look like total loosers but i have never had anything that someone actually cared to think about.. Jessica Lovins and i used to be best friend in the 7th grade and during Valentines day that year her and i got nothing.. It really sucked because everyother girl was getting things and we weren't... So for my 13th birthday which is Feb. 29 she bought me this little thing of glitter that said LOVE BITES on the top of it.. Everytime Valentines day comes along i think about what she gave me and i totally agree.. Maybe someday i will get something meaningful... The guy that my dad is training right now is taking his girlfriend to the Bahamas this weekend and proposing to her.. GOD.. Can you imagine?? I think that is really cool.. Thats another thing that i have always thought about.. I would like when whoever it is that proposes to me it is really romantic and everything just works out perfectly.... Okay well now that you know all about my pathetic love life.. Im gonna go.. Thanks for reading..

"event","So today the weather really sucked and it was rainy and cold and wet.. I hate this weather... I just got home from going to the mall with Rachael and it has to be said she kicks ass.. I love that chick..  Sometime her and i are going to to bathing suit shopping so she can tell me the truth on weather it looks good on me or not because she said today that people like to take her shopping because if you don't look good in something she will come right out and tell you.. So therefore she will be coming with me to pick out my bathing suit and maybe this year i will like it for the whole summer..

So schools pretty good.. Im failing Geometry and i HATE bilogy with Mr. Sacco he still lives with his parents and he looks like 40 years old.. What a  queer...  All Camile and i do in Geometry is pass notes and we have both decided that the passing notes needs to stop because if we don't we will fail... My 2 other classes are okay though.. Spanich i have a 94 and passing in Intro. to Journalism.. She wont tell us our grades.. Stupid bitch...

While i was talking to Rachael today i told her that i always wanted to be a little bit thinner.. Not like really really skinny just to be nice looking.. I have always been really self concious of my body and was always affraid that i was going to be the ""Fat kid"".. I don't think im fat i just think i could lose a couple of pounds.. Yeah that would be nice.. Maybe that will be my new goal for the month.. Lose 5 pounds.. I will keep you updated on that.. ttyl

"event","So this week so far school has been good... The panthers lost on Sunday which kinda sucked because i really thought that they were going to win and everyone in South Carloina would be really happy but its okay i think we played a good game... Lately in Mr. Sacco's class i haven't been paying attension and i have tried really i have but i just can't help but do homework or draw meaningless pictures that make me look like a looser... I just sit there and look blankly at him and finally get bored enough to start drawing.. I prolly need to start paying more attension.. Maybe ill try it...

So i went to Wal-Mart today and got 2 new shirts.. They are just plain because i bought some stuff to write on them with.. If anyone has any ideas about what i should write on them please tell because i have no clue... 

So far this week i haven't felt like dressing nice or anything... Usually i will dress up at least once a week and the rest of the days i will wear nice shirts that look half way decent on me.. For the past little while i really haven't cared about what i am wearing.. I just wear what looks comfortable and looks okay on me... I mean im just going to school.. I see these people every single day.. It just gets old always trying to dress up and look nice.. I mean who can you really impress in high school???  Thanks for reading...

I think i will just go with what i think is ""right"" it probably wont be the right thing in the end but im willing to take that chance im just going to go with the flow and see what happens in the end...Sorry this entry is a little all over the place but i wanted to talk about what was bothering me.. Thanks for reading

"event","So being grounded is okay... My parents aren't really that strict about things.. Now that im into the second week they will prolly start letting me do more stuff... 

So i just got my Seventeen magazine and i have always wondered if the Horescopes in there are true.. I have never kept up on the dates that they say will be good or the ones that wont... I guess in the back of my head i think about it through the month but thats about it.. How do they come up with horoscopes?.. I know it has something to do with the planets and like how their alligned or something but thats it... It weird how i always think that what it says is going to happen and then it never does... I guess for that minute or so i beleive it will and then im off thinking about something else...

Lately life has been pretty good... School is cool.. I had to go to the ISS room on Friday because Camile and i were late for Geometry and even if your a minute late he sends you... Ohh well Camile and i ment to do it.. We didn't feel like going back to class so we didn't.. I like being in there for half a period.. Its much better then sitting in class... I think i will go back there sometime...

Right now life is pretty good... Im just hanging out.. I've got really cool friends and i always have someplace to go or someone to see most of the time... If i don't want to do anything and just hang out then i do.. I hang out most of the time just because during the week i get so tired and by the time the weekend is here im really tired and all i want to do is sleep.. 

Another thing that i have been thinking about lately is the fact that im not that confident in myself.. I always think that if i could just lose a little more weight then i would be okay.. Or if i was a little bit prittier then guys would like me more.. That I think is going to be part of my new goal... Just to be comfortable with me... Thanks for reading.

An update on how my whole i don't care what other people think attitude is going pretty good.. Im going with Rachael on Sunday to go and get my pink chucks which is going to be fun because im going to go and show rachael how to get some good clothes from Hollister..

So lately i have been i think a lot more open to people.. When im walking down the halls in school if i see someone that i know i scream at them untill i get their attension... I have been talking to a lot of different people lately and i like it.. I like going down the hallways at school and having different people start talking to me or everyone just gathering around in the commons area to talk.. I love that i think it is ausome when you have all your friends there and you can just talk to them all at once and no one is really in a rush to go anywhere you can just stand there and have a nice conversation with everyone.. I have been trying to hang out with a lot of my friend lately because i am sick at being home now.. A couple weeks ago all i did was hang around my house and do nothing.. I don't know what it is but all of a sudden i want to go out and chill with a bunch of people and never be at home and always be out doing something.. Which is good because then i can hang out with all of my friends but its also a lot of work trying to plan stuff.. But all my friends are ausome and it is totally worth it...Okay well im going to go.. Thanks for reading.

"event","So i have really been thinking about all the things that go on in my life lately and why i am the person that i am... I have really thought about my last journal entry a lot and those thoughts were just what i felt right at that moment... I have changed my mind so many time about what i want to look like or what i really like and want people to see and know about me.. I have found out that i want to wear what i want to wear and not be affraid that when i go to school everyone is going to think im a loser because i am wearing Chucks and im not suposed to be wearing those if i dress the way i do.. I have always had a problem since about middle school... I have to be what i think other people will like... Like if i don't dress a certain way then the popular girls wont talk to me or something like that... I have decided though that people will prolly talk to me no matter what i wear.. If i am a good person and if i am nice to people and treat them with some kind of repsect then they will probably show that same respect back towards me and if they don't then that is their problem because i was myself and if they don't like that then that is their problem... I know that i have talked about new years resolutions and all the things that i really need to change about myself but i think that my new goal is to just be myself if i want to go out and buy and certain pair of shoes then i am going to.. If i want to wear them then i should be able to and who cares if people judge me.. If they really took the time to get to know me then they just might like me... I am no longer going to live my life for other people.. Im just going to live it for me and try and be myself and not worry about what other people think of me...

"event","So school is okay.. This semester is going to be a lot of work but i will get through it.... I have lunch with morgan and a lot of other people that i know which is good because i can go and see everyone during lunch.. I have B lunch and it is really crowded so morgan and i have decided that we need to bring our lunch so that we will have time to eat.. I don't really have a lot of classes with all of my friends but i know a lot of peoplle in my classes... Like i know their names and they know me but we have never hung out or anything like that.... Im excited to hang out with new people though and get to talk to new people.. Thats always fun.

I have been thinking about changing my style lately.. Just because i think that everyone looks so much better then me... I know i don't look like a cheerleader, but im not a punk, or gothic, or emo, i just really don't fit into a group and i think i would like to be a part of one.... But it is always really hard because most people want you to get the fuck away from them... I guess it is just something that i have always wanted.. Just to be a part of one group and not be by myself and the girl that looks like a prep but isn't a cheerleader or on dance team.. I think that high school is really hard and there are a lot of choices that you can make that can either totally kill you or make people think you are cool... I just haven't really hung out with a lot of people at my school or talked to a lot of them really.. I think that is my new years resoloution to start talking to and hanging out with more people from my school and being more talkative and open minded to new poeple and not always judge people... I'll tell you how that goes... Thanks for reading please comment..

So right now a lot of stuff is going on in my school... Everyone is getting in trouble with the cops and everyone thinks that everyone else has narked on them... I don't know exactly who narked on everyone but whoever it was needs to run and hide in a corner somewhere before someones kills them... I hope to god no one narked on me becasue i have't hung out with these people in quite a while, and i hope none of my friends go to jail :(... 

So we are going back to school on Tuesday and i really don't want to.. I am having to much fun sitting at home doing nothing and being able to go out and drive around and do stupid shit all day... I like going back to school kind of because we get all new classes and its cool to see new faces....  The suckie part of going back to school is that its school.. And no matter how people try and think that it is fun... Its not... You sit in a desk for 7 hours and listen to people teach you pointless shit that you are never going to use in your lifetime... The only good thing about school is that you can talk to your friends and see them all day long... Okay well thanks for reading... Please Comment..

"event","So Christmas was good.. I didn't get some of the stuff on my list and i have to take some of the stuff i got back but other than that everything went well... We went to the neighbors for a little get together that was cool... 

So my grandparents are coming today and i am a little excited because my dad and my grandfather are going to move around my room and fix my tv... My grandma on the other hand is very selfish and she isn't that fun to be around other than the fact that she does have to get me a Christmas preasent... my grandmother makes me think because she is very very selfish and basically doens't do anything to help anyone else out... I wonder if something in her childhood lead to ehr being like this.. maybe the expiriences that she had and the people that she met had something to do with how she acts now that she is older.... She just interests me because i would like to know how she come to become the person that she is today... Was there a certain expirience or did something happen to her when she was younger that made her who she is today...  She got married when she was 19 and had 5 kids... That is very young and that is a lot of kids... She doesn't really seem like the person that should have kids really.. But she did and my dad turned out fine so it is all good... I can kinda see her in him frankly... He likes everything to revolove around him and expects everyone to do things his way.. Oh well he is my dad so i love him.. Thanks for reading

"event","So today i went to the mall and got my Christmas preasent from my neighbor michelle i got a new sweater and i like it a lot.... Then morgan and i chilled for a little while because i had to get away from my sister because she was getting really annoying so morgan and i changed my journal around.. I like it... Something different which is always good...

Rachel Richards invited me to her birthday party we are going to go up to downtown Charlotte on New Years Eve and she says it is like a big party in the street so that promices to be fun.. We are also going to go to the mall sometime but we will see about that...

I need something cool to talk about but right now i can't think of anything.... Hmmm...  Well the only thing that is on my mind is Christmas because it is my favorite holiday and it is only 3 days away and i can't wait... I don't like Christmas just because of the preasent either... I like gettting the fire going and the winter weather i just love the whole season so much fun...

My neighbor said to me today that she thinks that your personality is different depending on when you were born in your family... Like if you were born 1st, 2rd, 3rd, 4th, and so on... My neighbor has 4 kids and i babysit for her a lot because she pays me pretty well and her 3rd kid is a little brat... I mean all of them are brats but this one is really bad...  She acts like she is 2 and it really gets on my nerves but off of her.. It really made me think like if i were born 2nd instead of 1st would my personality be different or would i be the same person just younger??  It just interested me because i do beleive that the things in your life and the expiriences that you have do add to your personality and make you stronger at something and it just contributes to who you are as a person... But i don't know if being born in a certain order would change your personality or not... Just some of my thoughts... Please Comment

So exams were today... I think i did pretty good in Chorus we watched Chicago the musical and had to answer 29 questions on it and then in World History it was pretty easy because it was open notes...

So lately life has been pretty good.... It really doesn't feel like Christmas yet but i am sure once i am out of school it will... I gave christmas cards out to all my friends on tuesday so that was pretty cool...  

I have been thinking lately about the choices we make in life and how they can effect us down the road..  It is kinda scary i mean when i am driving if i make one dumb move i might go off the road or hit someone... I just can't believe that in like a split second my life could be over... Things like that just freak me out because i have no control over what happens next in my life... I do beleive in destiny and that everyone has a certain path that they lead every day.. I think that we were put her to do something but i am not sure what yet but maybe someday i will know...  Maybe i will find something that i really enjoy doing and that will become my career and i will be glad to go to work each day... But you never know and thats what scares me is that one day something will happen... I know that i can't worry about everything though so i will just go on with life and hopefully nothing bad will happen... Thanks for reading

That was fun morgan didn't get her CD which sucks and morgan i sorry that i told you to eat instead of buying it.. Can you ever foregive me???

So i was thinking this weekend and i really don't think that i could have gotton through some of the things in my life if it wasn't for my friends..  I mean i have a close family and all... But if it weren't for my friends i really wouldn't have been able to make it through... Just to have someone to listen to me and like really listen to what i have to say and not just stand there nodding their head... And i really just needed someone to talk to and it was just nice to have people there that understood and could help me out... So i wanted to say thank you to Morgan cause i can never stay mad at you and i think we will be calling eachother for the rest of our lifes, Thanks a ton for being there and I LOVE YOU NIGGA.... And also to Diana because she listened to a ton of my shit and she didn't have to do that and she did so diana, You kick ass and thanks a lot for being there I LOVE YOU..

Sorry if this is boring but i felt like i had to say thank you to some people for helping me through my life...

So i was thinking today about different kinds of people and there are a ton of different people in my school... I mean there are people that have no money and people that have a ton of money and we have a ton of different ethnic groups around also... It is just cool to walk down the hallways and see different people... I found out that there are 1900 kids in our school and that is a ton of people i always see new people and new faces... You can never know everyone... There are just too many people... It blows my mind...  People intrigue me... I like to think about what we do and why we do it.. Or why we act a certain way and why we judge people... 
We are just this big civilization and we all have different lifes and different looks but yet we are all together... Okay well i have to go.. TTYL

So the other day i was thinking and i have decided that i am really not as independant as i thought i was... I made my sister go into the drug store to tell the people that they gave us the wrong perscription because i didn't want to look like a loser and when my mom was putting up our tree today i really didn't feel like helping her cause i didn't want to get up and that just showed me that i am really lazy also...  The thing with the perscription is just that i didn't want to look like a loser going back in there but i mean what am i going to do when i am 25 and living on my own and have to do that... I can't call my sister to go in for me... So my new goal is to be more independant and be able to just do things by myself sometimes and not have to have someone with me all the time... Oh and about that lazy thing... I have found out that on the weekends i really don't have any energy to go out and do things... I will call my friends talk to them on line but thats it... I don't really make plans because i never feel like doing anything... Hopefully this little phase that i am in will pass and i will have the energy to go out and do things and not just to sit at home and sleep all day... Well i have to go thannks for reading...

So i think that i am allergic to cats cause today i was peting the people that i am staying withs cat and all of a sudden it started and i couldn't stop sneezing... I usually don't like cats but this cat is cool so i will get over it..

So today i was talking to my mom and we were talking about how one of my cousins has been with the same girl since like middle school and now they are 22 and are going to get married.... She told me that there is nothing wrong with this but she would rather me wait untill i had time to get out there and meet new people and find out who i am... So i plan on doing this... I want to go out and meet new people and things before i settle down... Well i have to go

"event","So today i got to Vermont finally it took us 15 hours to get up here and that is way to much time to spend in a car with my family...  Then my grandma had to give me this stupid article called ""A Brush with the Law"" i was like WTF.. Are you trying to tell me something... After that i wanted to go up to her and ask from some weed really bad...  God she irritates me i mean come on you don't give that kinda stuff to someone.. Needless to say i am not to happy with my grandma right now....

So tommarrow is thanksgiving and on the way up to Vermont i made a sign that said Happy Thanksgiving and whenever i would see another car that we were going to pass i would hold up the sign.. I thought this was very very cool but noooooo the people wouldn't look at the sign and i could have killed someone by the time we stoped... I love the holidays i can't wait untill christmas and thanksgivng is really cool also... It is cold here in Vermont i mean not like omg i am freezing my ass off but pretty cold and i like it... It is always fun to have a change in climate..

So i was thinking on the way up here that things are pretty good in my life... I mean things could go a little better and there are always things that i would like but right now everything is good... I have good friends and a good family life... So over all everything is good... I really couldn't ask from better friends and i always have something to do and people really CARE about me and i think that is ausome...  So to all of my friends out there Thanks for being there and I LOVE YOU!!! Thanks for reading..

Kristyn... Please Comment"

"event","So this weekend has been fun... Friday i hung out with Katy, Meghan, Brittany, and Katelyn and we had a lot of fun... Saturday i came home at like 7 and hung out.. Andrew came by but i was babysitting so i didn't talk to him... 

So i was thinking this weekend about what our lifes really mean... And i am not sure at all... Like what were we put on earth to do.. I mean how can you make your life meaningfull... I hang out with friend and go to the mall and movies and do a ton of things but what was i really ment to do here.. I don't even know if i am really here to do something i am just wondering am I?.... Plus lately i have been thinking about my future and how my life will change and what will i look like when i am 25 and thinking about settling down and having a family... I mean whenever i just sit by myself i think about what will happen to me in the future and if i am prepared for it.. The truth is is that we don't know what is going to happen.. We don't even know what is going to happen from day to day... I guess that is the good thing about life is you never know what is going to happen.. Like Forest Gump says ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one your going to get"" I love forest gump and in this line i would say he is completely right...

"event","So yeseterday i didn't get a chance to update this so i am going to write about what i wanted to yesterday in here... 

We had an assembly yesterday and it was with the dad of Rachel Joy Scott and she was the girl that was killed in Columbine because she said that she believed in god... I believe in god and all but i don't walk around trying to teach people about it... I am what i am and you are what you are... Thats all there is to it... Well I thought that the assembly was really good.. It didn't make me cry it just made me think because she was nice to people on her own.. She was never taught to be nice she just was... And she did things for people just to be nice.. I have always wanted to go up to a new person and introduce myself and show tehm around and try and make their day a little bit better.. I mean i moved to Fort Mill when i was in the 4th grade and i don't really remember a lot about it but i do know that i felt really really out of place and all i wanted to do was be Vermont with my friends... It was hard but now i woulnd't move back there if my life depended on it.. You think Fort Mill is small this is nothing compared to Bennington, Vermont... Well i just thought that i would tell you my stand point on the whole assembly and it really did make me think about how i was acting and the things that i say to other people... It just made me see that maybe if you do something nice for once you could ""help"" someone... Even for that one second if you can just be there to talk to them or even to listen it really does make a difference cause i know people that i can just pour my heart out to them and they just listen and sometimes you just don't want people to tell you what to do you just want them to listen, to get it off your chest... Well thanks for reading and i hope you will comment about what you think... Thanks

    girl that all the guys want.

"event","So today nother special went on and i had a headache all day so that kinda sucked...  So today i was thinking about what i am doing for thanksgiving and i realized that it is only like 2 weeks away.. So i called my friends in Vermont and we decicded that i am going up there and it is going to kick ass... I am soooo excited.. I went up there over the summer but only for a week and i had a good time so hopefully i will have a good time this trip also..

So morgan just asked me if someone could ""change""... I don't think that you could just change your personality... Like one night go to bed and be like tommarrow i am going to be a different person... I think that you are what you are and you can't change that... I have a problem with not being able to make my own decisions i have to ask what other peoples opinions are.. This is a trait that i need to fix.. I need to be independant and have my own mind... This is going to be hard for me but i will do this.. lol... Hopefully

"event","So this weekend has kicked ass...  I really didn't do much but i got to hang out with a bunch of people and met a new girl Lyndsay Hazelwood and she is really cool...  Friday i hung out with Brittany and Katy and Lyndsay untill like 11 and then Brittany spent the night at my house.. Saturday we hung out all day and Saturday night we went to Wing King to meet Will... Today i am just going to hang out and not do anything cause i don't feel like doing anything...  

Gosh, i really just don't feel like doing anything.. Have you ever had that feeling that you just don't want to do anything... All you want to do is sit there and not worry about anything and not think about anything just sit and be content with yourself..

One of my good friends called me this weekend and was crying so i went right over there and she was broken-hearted...  Her old boyfriend that she lost her virginity to was at a party that she was at with his new girlfriend and it hurt her a lot...  She wants to move on but she can't and her mom isn't really helping cause she has her own problems and her dad is doing his best and it is just a big mess... Me personally i have never really been in LOVE and i have never really had a serious relationship.... I have never really wanted one.. i always like being able to do what ever i want and not having to worry about what am i going to tell my boyfriend or having to spend time with them when i really want to go out with my friends.. Maybe someday that guy will come and i will be prepared to be boyfriend/girlfriend with but for right now i am happy doing what i want when i want to.. Thanks for reading....

"event","Today was fun... Just like every other day...  School is a lot of fun sometimes.. I mean i don't like the whole learning aspect but i love seeing all the people.. I mean we all some from different backrounds and different homes but we are all together at the same time.. I just think thats cool.. 

I mean at our school we have really rich people and then we have people that are in the middle and then people that don't have that much... Sometimes i just look at people and wonder what is happening in their head.. Or what they go home to every night.. I mean you can never tell.. People don't let it show... I know that whenever i went to school upset i never wanted anyone to know.. Not even my friends.. I just wanted to be treated like nothing happen.. Like i was just normal.. And then if someone if looking at you than you are affraid that they know that something is wrong.. 

I have always been told that it is okay to cry.. Sometimes you just need to let it all out.. I myself have a hard time doing this.. I hate to have people see me cry.. I just keep it inside hoping that it will just go away on its own...  I guess i just don't have anyone that i am comfortable crying with... I mean i talk to my friend and all but i mean there is noone that i can tell everything.. And if i feel like crying just cry and not be ashamed of it.. Just sit there with them and tell them all my secrets and let it all out....  Well i am going to go.. thanks for reading..   Please Comment

"event","Why do people have to make things so complicated?  I mean just say things and get it over with or just be honest.. I know it might hurts someones feelings but just tell them the truth.. Or maybe it is hard for you to tell the truth but things just get all messed up if you try and put it ""easily"" when all you are really doing is making it worse....  I mean nothing really set me off about this it is just something that i noticed.. I mean i just hate it when someone tries to tell you something or put you down ""gently"".. What a bunch of crap.. There is no way that that could ever happen.. Just tell the truth and get it over with.. 

So lately my life has been pretty good.. Nothing really bad.. I just had one thing that kind of bothered me... Why do people say that they hate most of the people in the school... And they happen to hate you and you are standing right next to them... I mean are they trying to get into a fight with you??? I mean what is the point in saying that right in front of you???  I think that they just wanted me to say something but i am not about to cause i really don't have anything to say to them.. 
Well i must go and talk to morgan... Shes the Shit!! lol byes

Let me think of something smart to say...  Have you ever been torn between to things?  Like two things you really want but you have to choose between them.. I have a lot of those.. I can't decide what i want to do with my life be a nurse or a hairdresser.. I can't decided what to do on everyday things.. Like what am i going to wear tommarrow.. I usually have to think on it though the night and then pick it out in the morning.. I think that i am going to start doing things on my own and not depending on other people to decide what i do or when i do it.. I guess that would make me more independent.. Cool...

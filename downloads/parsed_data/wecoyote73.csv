"event","The last week had been much better. Met several new friends, solved a few problems,and got good news about heart.  My son, daughter, and her boyfriend came by last nite.  Shared pizza, beer, and good times.  I really love them so much.  Going on spiritual journey with ex girlfriend Thursday nite, Hey, we're still gonna be friends. Heck, ask my ex wives.  :)  Still looking for true love, one who can mesh so well its hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. In the meantime. I'm definitly going to enjoy the quest.  I'm a very affectionat, passionate, sensual person, and that definitly gets me into trouble. Life is good."

"event","Woke up this morning a little sad. Usually I would be waking on Sunday with my lover in my bed.  Kinda lonely.  Met my first lady since last week's breakup yesterday.  Looked great, hit it off, but she had emergency and had to work last nite, so spent nite with a glass of wine, ""Chicago"", and my Cockateil. Funny, looking back, I've spent most of my adult life with someone; which makes being single even more lonely, I guess.  Sorry about the down note.  Not depressed; in reflection.  Have always been a very passionate person, its both a blessing and a curse, but far better than feeling nothing."

"event","I am ready to start having fun again. Going out meeting new people and living what I have left of life to its fullest. I am 47 and single again, and these are supposed to be the best years of my life. Its time to stop going to work everyday to only come  home to a empty apartment, then spend my night walkign around buckhead. Heres to a new start, a journal, and a happy future."

Ive been a happy relationship that seems to have suddenly ended, though I'm not sure.  Her job,family, etc. is putting huge burdens on her, and now she wants a break from it all, even us.  She says she loves me and wants me to stay, but needs ""space"". I'm familiar with the ""space"" thing, which usually means its over, according to experts.  Is this true?  Should I give up?  Is there any woman who wants a man that is very affectionate and loving, or should I be an asshole, as my son says?  I really want this person, but feel I should move on......"

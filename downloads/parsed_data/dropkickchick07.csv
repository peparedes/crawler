Gradesw are up 3A's 3B's and a C. Pretty damn good. Lots of extra curriculars too. CEM commitee, academic octathalon, band, choir, theatre and BPA. If things keep up I'll be sound as a pound baby. I think its the new optimism thing. Not to worry I will always be my same old cynical self. Just with more of a positive out look! Blah I'm tired and I think my toe is broken and im sick so im going to bed but its good to be back.

Yea 2 saturdays ago was homecoming and i must say i was pretty good for the most part. can't say much for the day before that was just all a big misunderstanding no big deal right right. Saturday i judged at the JH speech and drama comp. It was boring until about 6 when i started hanging out with Justin (met him at Homecoming) hes kinda nerdy but funny and kinda cute what can I say hes a good boy and Ive had it with bad boys. I failed english and biology but in the infamous words of shakespeare alls well that ends well right! I can't do the musical now though dads rules. he pisses me off. Region auditions are in almost 2 wks im scared but thats ok. wow so my hand hurts from practicing and i gotta make a few phone calls so yea (hit meh)

"event","Yesterday was the first football season or as Chris Jones puts it the last first football season of my sophomore year...like I care. It was fun I miss the shows we did at santaluces and making funny of the cheif. I miss our dance to Louie Louie and Get Money. But I like the interaction we have with the Strutters and the Cheerleaders or as Sara and I call them the Whores(not that there is anything wrong with that). I had fun with some of the flutes like Heather Sara Lori Kristen and our only guy flute Kenny. The rest were either annoying freshman or I just didn't interact with him. I must say our stand tunes are way better here then at SHS. I was upset at the drumlines lack of playing the cadence ""KOPS Kick Butt(HUH)."" For those of you who are Santalulu people and are reading this KOPS stands for Klein  Oak Percussion Section. We went to the  new Wendys after the game and found out that there was gonna be a rumble between our football team and someother school I forget which one. So ofcourse the cops were pulling over like every car coming from that direction so me and Melinda had to take the long way home. Thats something sooo idiotic I thought it could only happen in Florida (no offense) but i guess it can here. Seriously who rumbles what are we like the fricken cast of grease. Well church tomorrow then maybe mall with Trevor either tomorrow of monday. So ima bouce. Luv ya

"event","Band Camp again...it was fun. According to Brittany me and Trevor both have a ""thing"" again. shes a dork. Im thinking shes got the hots for Nate though. That would be muy interesante.I found out that Anna got PYCC. Thank GOD it wasn't me. I was thinking about it the other day and it would just be another thing to keep me from my studies which would keep me from leaving boring Spring and going to NYU. So even if I had gotten it I would hve turned it down. So I'm happy I didn't have to dissapoint anyone and turn them down. I'm dehydrated...I can see all my vains in my arms and I'm thinkin thats not a good thing so Ima get myself hydrated again. Luv Ya.

Then we went inside and played the fight song and alma mater for the freshmen so they could learn. It was fun even though it was really hot b/c we are on asphalt. Trevor is irresistibly growing his hair out grrrrr. J/K I love it I can't deny long hair...he's evil. After band I went and saw ""The Village"" today. I was dissapointed it wasn't so scary but it was a really good really realistic concept. Today I found out I'm a communist!!!!!!!!!! But thats ok b/c i know it doesn't work and I live in a democracy...o well. Im smelly from sweating soooo Ima take a shower. Luv Ya!!!!!

I was soooo glad when it ended but in a way disappointed. I met a ton of great people. My relationships with everyone definately grew. I really don't feel like the new girl anymore. Sometimes I still do but not so much. I feel more included and more...well...liked. I won't forget that trip and all the memories it was truely something life changing. I never realized other people realized how I care for everyone and try so hard to have everyone like me. Im happy people got to see that part of me, because I do love all my brother and sisters in christ. Well my brother rented Spider Man 2 the game and now Im an official addict so Im gonna go play.

"event","After going out to lunch today I finally figured out something. I will always be the new girl. The one everyone goes to when all their other friends are busy. Sometimes even then they forget about the new girl. Ive never been able to say yea I grew up there. Ive never been able to have a real best friend b/c they already have better best friends. I'd like to say it doesn't really bother me when other ppl are talking about what they did with so and so but the truth is it really does. It hurts my feelings. All I end up thinking about is why wasn't I invited? Im just too shy to actually ask. I'm always telling myself ""god stop being such a pussy this is your sixth state you should be used to it""  but im not and it hurts more and more with every move.  And i don't want pity and I don't expect anything to change because truthfully I know not many ppl outside of my family really care about me. I just needed to get everything out before i go and do something stupid. So yea whatever.

From watching my brother and sister 15 sucked and I know it will i mean come on I watch my so called life...they're 15 and they think life sucks. Last night I was watching the first season of Sex and the City with my friend and do you think its true what Carrie says. Is there a civil war between women that are in a couple and women that are single? If so that sucks majorly. Life is just o so complicated. Can't it just go  back to normal. I wanna be 7 again when life was a sinch. And now since I am in a world surrounded by hormones good and bad all anyone can talk about is sex. Sadly I am totally in on it I won't deny it. Its always the same whos slept with who and where, whats the farthest youve gone with a member of the opposite sex and my favorite...if you could do anyone who would it be? I've answered that questions atleast 50 times this year and it changes everytime too. From Johnny Depp(but only in Whats eating Gilbert Grape or Benny & Joon) to Dana Carvy to Cory Matthews I am the queen of picking weird guys I like em old young short tall. My last flavor of the week is Pippin from LOTR im a sucker for trhe sweeties. Ok Ill spare yall with my sex talk and go drink water Im on a 72 hour water fast don't worry theres nothing wrong its just a simple experiment. Luv ya!

I already had 40 at home but nothing beats sparklers. I chilled at home until Ali and Scott came over and we got some popits then and dinner. We watched half of 50 first dates. Then we got into a fight about putting on bug spray. My sister stormed out in a fury and I almost called Tyler to have him pick me up and well just take me away. I finally calmed down and so did Ali so she came back and we finally set of our fireworks ($64 worth of fireworks), That was around 11 Roarke got home from work around 12 and he helped us set off the rest. We watched the rest of our movies and everyone went to bed.

Today was quite interesting I got up no parents. They were out test driving cars. So im chillen watching Uncle Buck when my mom calls. Low and behold she says your dad bought a car. A BMW Beamer (I thick i spelled it right), red,sports car, fully loaded. I was like hell yea. Now Roarke gets the Saab and in a year he gets to share it with me! Im gonna go he is just driving up.

We get along soo much better we usually can't spend a day together with out fighting but the last tow times Ive seen her not even one petty argument! We have so much in common too Like we like the same music and both our favorite colors are pink. We can probably both say we love shoes more than Carrie on Sex and the City. (personally I can say Carrie calls a beautiful pair of shoes her lovers I call them my soul mate)I just really can't wait until Ali and Scott are here Im sooo excited this is the first time in 5 years Ill have been able to see my sister for more than a week at a time and I really think her being here will help me alot with everything im going through!

I told Hyatt how I've been feeling lately and I never realized how good he makes me feel. If only it would have worked out for us.

Its so sad I just got the the part where Allies mom should up and told Allie her fiance was coming and was going to be there soon and Allie needed to choose between Noah the love of her life that shes finally seen after 14 years of Lon her fiance. So far she went with her mind and not her heart and chose Lon so she wouldn't hurt her family but hopefully she will choose Noah in the end b/c i still have lilk 78 pages to go! Its soooo sad though. Love like they have only comes around once in your life. You only have one soulmate. I don't think Ill ever find love like that though and if I already have i passed it up. Im in a rut....a funk im just sooo depressed lately. With everything about trev and i found out i need braces again even though they just came off b/c there isn't enough space for my implants and me just not feeling right I don't know what to do with myself I just feel empty and I don't know what to do!!!!! Somebody please help me!"

"event","I just went to the most boring ""party"" ever! The only good part was when some of the guys took their shirts off hizott! I got two outfits for banquet. So I am where the more party one to banquet and the less party one to graduation. Both of them are awesomely cute though. I have a new found respect for Scott from WCPC. I don't know b/c like Ive always thought he was like cute but immature. Ive just for some reason have been seeing him in a knew light and realizing there is alot more to him than just a bod and jokes. I have to finish my project for Dr.E. catcha lata lyl

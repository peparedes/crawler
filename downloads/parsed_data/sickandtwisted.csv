R. Martin. These are seriously the best books I have ever read and a series is going to be fucking amazing. Each season of the show is going to cover 1 book so thats atleast 9 seasons they will have for this. I'm so fucking excited about this, I cant wait!"

I thought we had great potential but obviously she didnt think so. I dont know how to describe how I feel right now. I dont know what I'm going to do with my time now. I spent almost every day with her, now I have nothing to do. Maybe I'll start playing WoW again. I'm so distressed, I'm afraid of being alone for another 3 years. But I dont want to go through all that courting bs again. Oh well life goes on I guess, God only knows what the future holds."

"event","So last friday was my 19th birthday, that was quite the night. We started off at kelly o'brians for dinner. While there they bought me the dumbest looking drink I have ever seen, it was called a leprechaun urine sample. The drink was green and the straw was so long I had to put it on my lap to drink it. the rest of the stay there consisted of various other drink/shots, some were good and some were terrible. I also got the best birthday present ever, a book called the Cannabis Companion. This book is pretty awesome, it has lots of information, rolling guides and some recipes that sound really good.  After that we headed for the willow, this is where the party really started. Mike told all the strippers that it was my birthday, I wont go into what happened after this but I'll say it involved body shots and my face in various places.. next we went to cheetahs. I have no idea how we ended up there but we didn't stay very long, only long enough to roll a joint. Then we headed to gotchas were several more shooters and drinks were had. We hung out there for a bit then headed back to cheetahs to meet some friends from work. While there we saw the hottest stripper I've ever seen(which isn't saying much because this was my first night seeing strippers). My friends then all pitched in a bought me a lap dance from this stripper. again I wont go into what happened in there but I'm sure you can all use your imagination. after that people bought me more shots and by this time it was almost 2 and all the bars were closing so we headed to the pita pit for some more food. By this time I was pretty drunk and spent the whole time in there sitting because it was too hard to stand. After that everyone started heading home so we called a cab and waited.. after half an hour of sitting out in the cold we called them back and asked where our damn cab was, they said it would be there asap. So we waited there for another half an hour and ended up getting a ride home from a completely different cab company. 

All in all it was a really good night and I didn't even have a hang over."

""These magnificent magical creatures are fun, festive, and prone to unexpected mood swings. They keep a very neat lair with tasteful, yet bold use of space and color. These whimsical beasts are thoughtful and perceptive about noticing your new haircut or if you have purchased a new pair of adventure boots even when you are not so thoughtful. They can be counted on to get excited about going shopping and gossiping about that 'awful' new guy one of your friends seems interested in. They enjoy long walks on the beach, weepy films about relationships and eating ice cream directly from the bucket when depressed. You will only be attacked by one if you directly provoke it, or if you have no good answer to the question ""Does this make me look fat?"" -- which is the same thing."""

I guess she has just moved on to bigger and better things. I know now that I won't be remembered, I'll just be one of the guys from her past that isn't and never was important. I'll never be her friend, I'll never be anything to her again. I feel so alone, the only person I trusted has cut me deeper than I ever thought possible.

I wish she missed me as much as I miss her. or I wish she knew how I was feeling. or even cared how I was feeling. I wish she didn't move on so fast. it seems as like this didn't even phase her.

I hate my life and I want to die."

I probably shouldn't tell you but I dreamed of you last night.

You told me that you loved me, I started tearing down those walls.
I really started to trust you but you set me up to take the fall.
I guess I'm not prepared to say...
Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again

I guess that I'm wrong for falling in love,
But you're still the one that I'm dreaming of.
I guess that it's you I want to hold onto,
But you're holding onto someone else."

I don't know what I said
But I didn't mean to hurt you

I heard the words come out
I felt like I would die
It hurt so much to hurt you

Then you look at me
You're not shouting anymore
You're silently broken

I'd give anything now
to hear those words from you

Each time I say something I regret I cry ""I don't want to lose you.""
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah.

'Cause you were made for me
Somehow I'll make you see
How happy you make me

I can't live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive

So stay with me
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry.

And you forgive me again
You're my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt you"

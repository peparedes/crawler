"event","I awoke from a bad/good dream at 6:15 this morning.  What a vivid dream about Huey.  I remember buying a tix to see a show in San Francisco.  I missed my connecting flight to San Fran and somehow ended up getting to the show on time I had front row center seat and I got there just as Huey took the stage.  I was in a frenzy looking for my tix.  He looked at me, I shrugged my shoulders in disbelief that I did not have my tix and that is when I awoke.  I hope that's not a premonition of something to come. Maybe it means my dream was supposed to come true (meeting Huey) and due to my own stupidity (forgotten tix) I did not.  I believe it was my fear of my own dream coming true and maybe my own way of sabotaging it.  I hope not.  Regardless of the meaning. Huey was hot !!!!  I still see him giving that goofy shrug that he does in his video's - you know the one I mean - big shoulders and big blue eyes.  It's that lovable, goofy shrug.   :)

Anyway, we looked at a puppy this week.  My mother is so excited about it.  I could care less.  I love animals and will be fine with it or without it.  Whatever makes her happy.  Today, I put down some flooring in the basement (vinyl stick tiles) in front of the laundry area.  It really does a lot for that space.   I also cleaned the stove top (nightmare).  We have one of those radiant heat stoves so the top of the stove itself is smooth.  However, food can get burnt on the top and today I spend an hour with a scraper (razor) cleaning it.  It looks great but what a pain.  

My uncle p/up jake and took him to play for about an hour.  That was nice.   All for now.  Time to get to bed - gotta work tomorrow (ugh)"

"event","I know it's been a while.  I been playing games online lately filling the void in my life.  I am fairly lonely (in terms of male companionship).  My son and job occupy so much of my life I have no chance to do much else.  Still I go on.  My mother, of course, who has good intentions, never watches him so I can go out and I don't bother asking 'cuz it's not worth the repercussion.

I am still unhappy living here with mom. She's a great lady but I am suffocated.  I am a 34 year old single mother and my mommy (meant w/sarcastic overtones) feels she has to hold my hand.  I want to scream, yet all I can do is cry and feel sorry for myself.  I sound so spoiled.  I have a lovely home and want for nothing yet it's not enuf.  I need to do it on my own.  I am stubbornly independent.  I need to prove I can handle things on my own and I don't need my mom to take care of me.  She just doesn't get it.  

Recently she changed jobs and then found she did not like it so she went back to her old job on 4/30.  Since she went back to work not one night has she watched a movie with my son or played with him (at a normal hour).  The earliest she finished work was 8pm.  and to that I now say whatever.  I won't ever say a word to her again about it.  When she decides what's important in her life again she will know.  One nice change that did come of her going back to her old job is that she is cooking dinner a bit more often so I now get to eat at a normal time rather than 6:30/7pm.  I appreciate that immensely.

I am still wallowing in self-pity.  I assessed my assets and here's the funny part.  I own nothing except all my clothes and knicknacks.  Isn't that crap.  My car - in mom's name, my bedroom furniture - still owe on it but my mother decided to open my bill one day and make a payment so even when I do finally owe nothing I can't feel the satisfaction of it cuz some of it's hers.  This computer she bought and got my uncle to pay for.  My mother's day present even came with a ""price"".  It was a lovely gift from my ""son"" $200 in gift cards to buy clothes.  But she had to throw a jab at me and say that she did not feel I was dressing well lately.  I want to scream right now - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!  

I am kicking myself for ever agreeing to share a home with her.  Outside of the fact it's a lovely home and great schools that's all I am happy about.  I wish I knew why I have such issues with her.  Deep down I know I am trying to do everything she did not and in many ways am so much like her it's frightening (and in those instances it's ok 'cuz they are her strong points).

OK enuf of that depression. Still never heard from HLN so I have that sorrow to deal with as well.  I have my tix for the show in torrington.  I decided not to go to the Boston show and the other show in CT goes on sale 6/7 so I should be all set with that.  I am disappointed that I was not even sent a response letter to my inquiry from the HLN staff considering I sent a SASE - not even an autographed pix.  I feel like I did 20 years ago when I first tried to join the fan club (which by the way I still can't get a response to join - now that's bullsh !!!

I lost track of my diet again and just can't stay focused.  I am so disappointed in myself.  I know I will get back on track soon.  

My son is doing great.  He will be 4 in one month.  I can't believe it.  I am so amazed.  I am in the beginning phase of scheduling his birthday party.

Summers coming and I am so happy for the warm weather - it's nice to get outside and enjoy fresh air.  I hope my misery/depression- self-pity turns around soon.  Cuz other than that I am a very happy woman.

all for now

I Love Huey & Jake"

"event","Been quite busy the last few days.  Work has been really hectic.  Moving business from one company to another is very time consuming.  Lots of paperwork involved.  I will be doing this transition for about 1 1/2 years (ugh) the bulk of it should be done by the end of march 2005 finishing up by sept 2005.  

The radiator on my car went this week. $770 later it was replaced, new hoses, an oil change and couple other minor repairs.  I have to put it back in the shop tomorrow for a couple other things hopefully it won't cost too much more.  

My uncle still has not given me a check for the work I have done for him.  I could use that money.  I know he will give me a check if I went to him and asked but what the hell at this point I will just finish the project and get one big check.  That will be nice.

(for my friends reading this my son is 3 1/2 and in potty training mode skip if you don't want the details :)
Jake is doing a little better about going #2 on the potty.  I made a potty chart for him - and told him after 5 #2's he would get a present.  Today we bought a train.  I brought him to the toy store & he picked it out.  While the #2's he is doing is not a start to finish it's a step in the right direction.  He still keeps forming the BM in his tushy and then sitting on the potty and bouncing up and down to force it out.  It's actually quite funny but not healthy for him.  He made a legit start to finish at school the other day but still had 2 accidents.  Tonight I caught him just in time and took him to the potty :)

Mom starts her new job tomorrow. She is quite stressed about it.  Not the job itself - but the change.  I am sure she will adapt and get into a routine in a few days and will be fine.  

I worked yesterday morning then to my grandparents for a visit, then home and my cousin came over for about 1/2 hour with michael and scotty, then to the grocery and finally to my other cousins house to take Jake to a Purim party at the synagogue.  It was his first such party.  He didn't understand a bit of what was going on. But he got to wear his superman costume (really jammies).  There was another boy there Jake's age in the same outfit and the teamed up.  The scariest part of the evening is when Jake ran off and I lost sight of him for a moment and did not know which direction he went.  I saw who I thought was Jake (with the mom of the other Superman) but it was he son.  I was frantic.  Thankfully he had fun back to my cousin and was fine.  It was very scarry.  I knew no one took him but for all I knew he ran out of the party room and out into the halls of the synagogue. There were several hundred people there.  I am just relieved he was fine.  

Today was less hectic.  Other than going to my grandmothers and the toy store it was quite a restful day.  I have to go back to court on tuesday and then a haircut (which I need very badly).

I did not go to WW yesterday as I had to work and did not budget my time well enough.  I may have to work next Saturday but will plan better so I can go weigh in.  I think I remained the same so I am not too dissapointed about not going for the official weigh in.  

All for now - need to go play trains with Jake."

"event","Well it was coming and it happened I had my meltdown.  I lost it.  My mother just doesn't get it.  No matter how many times I ask her not to do something she just can respect my request.  She criticizes me to the ""n""th degree and is so judgemental.  She lives her life to please others but make me suffer.  I can't take it anymore.  I know she loves me and she does some of this out of the goodness of her heart but for goodness sakes why can't she just respect my request.  I WANNA SCREAM. I want my own house again.  This was a mistake.  But now I am stuck.  I can't afford to move out.  I can't stick my mother with this house payment. But I need to be happy.

I can't talk to her because she over analyzes everything and can't take something for what is said.  My hobby is not a hobby to her it's an obesession.  Yes, I Love HLN and I am having a blast collecting items on the band but it's far from obsessed.  I am very grounded and know what's important.  It's my dream to meet Huey and just because she has no life (so to speak) mine is judged.

She gives me a ""look"" if I am not spending every moment with my son.  When she watches a movie with Jake, I get the speech that she is trying to give me mommy time.  big whoop !!! I don't need her for that.  I have not been out in months because I don't feel I need to run down my evening with her.  I can't even go out to lunch without giving her the details.  Hell, I can't go to the kitchen without her asking what am I doing?  I am suffocating.

Wow - I feel better.  I needed to get that off my chest.

On a lighter note, I am hoping to meet Diane for lunch on Saturday.  I am waiting to hear from Amy to see if she will watch Jake.  I can't wait something without my mother.   Woo Hoo.  I called applebees and they do have a weight watchers menu so I am waiting for a faxed copy of the menu and we will go there for lunch.  I am going to bring my scrap books with me.  I hope she likes them. I am sure she will.

My uncle still has not paid me for the work I have done for his office.  This project is getting very old very fast and I am getting bored.  We have been working on it for months and I want it over.

To those who drink have one for me 'cuz I could use it.  

Now that my meltdown is over I am better.  I just needed that good cry.  Now I should be ok for a few more months while I try to sort out what I am going to do and who I can speak with.  I can't talk to my grandparents - they will tell my mother.  And while my aunt will hold the conversation confidential she won't be of any help.  My uncle has enuf bs of his own to deal with ~ I would love to ask him to buy me a condo and I would pay him monthly for it but that is a bit too much to ask.  I don't even know if he would do it.

"event","Well the work week is over.  Fortunately it was a fairly mellow week.
I got my tix for the Huey Show in Torrington AND met 2 new Huey fans.  One in Bristol and the other in Wallingford.  The one in Bristol works at ESPN and says she knows my cousins. What a small world.  We chatted on-line last night for a couple hours.  We are also gonna try to get together for lunch next week.  That should be nice.  She is another one that has a ""in"" w/HLN.  While I won't ask direct I hope she or one of my other HLN contacts will help me achieve my goal of meeting Huey.  She knows it's my dream so maybe (I am keeping my fingers crossed - but I won't count on it).  Turns out we will be seeing all 3 shows together.  I will still buy my tix on my own since I tend to get better seeting as a single.  Fleet still has not put out the official 2004 schedule & foxwoods is not on sale yet.  So I will be watching that for a while.  I am guessing foxwoods will be on sale in June which is what they did last year.

I lost 3.4 pounds at WW this week.  Makeing a grand total of 9.4.  Not bad for the 1st two weeks. I also started working out yesterday.  GO ME !!!

I also had a dream about Huey last night.  Very strange.  I was in an airport in Montana and there was a man laying on a chair with a cowboy hat over his face and while I had no way of know if it was Huey I had a feeling it was.  I looked at him for a little while and presumed he was sleeping.  I had to go and as I left the airport (no mind you it was this one room buidling and it was nothing fancy) I walked out into a dust pit of a road - no pavement - just gravel and dirt and there was a red p/up there which said on the plate HLN so I knew that was it and when I turned the man was up and walking around so I ran back inside and it was Huey.  We chatted he gave me an autograph, a KISS, the phone # to the office and a backstage pass.  I left the airport a while later stunned and amazed.  Next I find myself in a boat with my mother and I am sitting at the very front of it and realized that I did not put everything in my pocket.  I find the autograph and tix but no backstage pass.  Myself and several people from the boat were put into a contest of sorts (sort of survival style) and the 1st to complete it won (don't know what the prize was).  You basically had to pull the cap of items, twist so the stuff inside came out (kind of like a tube of chapstick) and put the cap back on.  The problem was all the tubes were greased up so it made the challenge very difficult once your hands go all slimy.  I came in 3rd out of 5th and myself and another person from our boat were chosen to go do something.  I woke up from there so don't know what happened.  But it was very strange.  Been a longtime since I dreamed about Huey.

I watched Michal and Scotty with my mother yesterday.  Jake had a lot of fun with Michael.  A couple of sharing issues but nothing significant.  Scotty had a nice nap and is so easy to handle now.  He followed the boys around and just played very contentedly.  Michael ended up falling asleep on the floor in the den around 3:45 so Jake and scotty played very nicely until Amy came home.

Today I am going to take Jake to the Science Museum and again my mother has invited herself along.  I love my mom but she acts like we are a married couple and have to do everything together. It irritates me to high heaven.  OH well, guess it could be worse and she be not involved in his life.  So I will survive.  I will just have to make plans with out her know so I can have some mommy time with my son.  It's a little sneaky but I may have to do it.

I am in a good mood this morning and have a few things to do in my room cleaning wise so I am gonna get to it."

"event","What a day.  I am still battling this sinus infection but it did not get me down.  I saw a message posted on HLN.ORG that the boys are to be playing in Torrington CT on 8/26.  I called the Warner Theatre today and it was true.  I paid $50 for the membership which enabled me to buy a tix now rather than wait until they go on sale to the general public then I paid $63.50 for the tix.  Turns out since I only needed to buy 1 tix I got what I consider to be the best seat in the house - FRONT ROW CENTER.  How utterly cool.  Well worth the money.  I can't believe my luck.

I did go to the Dr today and he put me on an antibotic for 2 weeks.  I hope it kicks in soon because the pressure is intolerable when I bend down or laugh too hard.  But at least I can sleep at night since it's only in the sinuses and no longer cold congestion.

Other than that nothing unusal happened.  My birthday is gonna be awesome.  Concerts on 8/20, 8/21 & 8/26 - too bad they aren't playing in CT on my birthday.  But I will take these 3 shows anyday !!!!!"

"event","What a bummer.  This cold has now officially become a sinus infection.  My head is so filled that I think my brain slipped out thru my hair follicles.  I am so foggy - ugh.  I am going to the Dr tomorrow to get medicine. Hope to feel better soon.

I had a bad day on WW Sunday but got right back on track today.  I am gonna reach my goal and while I know there will be bumps I am determined.  I am even taking pictures as I go.  I set the cameraon automatic and took pictures from all angles beginning the 1st day and then every 10 pounds thereafter I am gonna take more pictures.  I know it sounds wierd but even after I lost 45 pounds I still felt very overweight and while I could tell the difference only in my face and my clothing size I was disappointed.  I think by taking pictures as I go will help as well.  Only my friends here know about it.  I am not gonna show anyone the pictures until I reach my goal weight.  It will be so cool to show family and friends at sometime in the future.

I got another magazine in the mail today with an article on HLN from 1983.  My scrap book is so great I look at it nearly every day.  I just LOVE looking at Huey.  One of my co-workers saw my magnet of Huey that I got at the concert last year and asked me who he was.  Of course I told her Huey and she commented on how handsome he is.  I said now you know why I have such a crush :)

My son made a sculpture in school today.  It consists of colored popsicle sticks and various wooden shapes (cones, circles, ovals squares etc...) It's so cute.  I love it when he gives me such sweet surprises.  I recently taught him how to sign I Love You with his hand and for Valentines day his teacher traced his hand and then bent the middle and ring finger down to leave the fingers for I Love You.  She put it in a planter and it looks like a flower. Totally awesome.

All for now.  I hope all my friends are well and look forward to chatting soon."

"event","Well my weekend started out great.  I awoke on Friday with the start of a cold and it was full blown by today. Bummer.  I can't breathe thru my nose.  I can't drink enuf water.  I can't sleep.  I am very tired and my son is going a mile a minute.  I have been up since 4 am. Nuf said.  I hope I can at least breathe thru my nose by tomorrow.  It would suck going into monday will very little sleep.  

Other than that things are fine.  I was on the radio Friday requesting a Huey song.  They played Heart of Rock and Roll.  The afternoon DJ knows me 'cuz I call 2-3 times a week between 12-1 to request an HLN song.  It's the 80's retro hour!!!!  He even quizzed me.  Caught me off guard for a moment but I rebounded.  The question was - what album was Heart of Rock & Roll on? Sports of course but it took me a moment to respond.  Chalk the hesitation up to a foggy head 'cuz of the cold LOL.

I hit the Jackpot on my EBAY buys and got about 7 different packages yesterday.  4 Magazines, a CD, Pictures and more.  I really have a great scrap book going on.  I can't believe how much I missed over the years.  I am still proud of my 1st scrap book from when I was a teenager but am having a blast now making a new one as well.

I miss chatting with Julie.  She posted a note that she got my package that I sent her on HLN Fanzone and noted something about her 150 hours up for this month.  Don't know when she will be back on-line - I hope it's soon.

Jake just finished a bath.  He is no longer fighting me when it comes to taking baths.  Only fighting when I tell him to get out. It's such a nice change from just a few months ago.  Now if I can just get him over the phobia of water on his head and his potty training done I will be even happier.

His grandmother bought him a ""throne of his own"" potty.  Anytime a substance passes the light a royal sounding song plays.  He has twice now used it.  Not from start to finish but it's a step in the right direction. 

Today is my cousins 20th birthday.  She and her family were at my grandparents for lunch so we went up for a little while.  It was so nice because Jake was occupied by his cousins and I had a few minutes of quiet time. (which I desparately needed).  

I had a productive day even with this head cold.  Dishes done, laundry done, beds made, etc...  Now it's time for dinner :)

I am thinking of Peanut Butter on Bread or a cheese sandwich.  I have a little while to think it over.   I am on a mission 60 pounds by 8/20 (Huey Concert) that's just 6 mo's & 4 days from now.  It's not unrealistic.  It won't be easy.  But I am determined to remain focused this time.

The letter I wrote was delivered to Huey.  OMG I can't believe it.  I pray he reads it and contacts me or has someone contact me.  I am still holding onto my Fortune Cookie that says An old wish will come true.  Well outside of winning the lotto (I mean hitting it big) or finding prince charming - this is it - meeting Huey - up close and personal.  Honestly,  I hope it's meeting Huey.

I have been listening to CD's and watching videos that Julie sent to me.  They are amazing.  I can't believe how much I missed out on over the years.  I will never let myself fall behind like that again.

Today was my 1st day of weight watcher.  I went yesterday and weighed in.  I did very well today.  The only thing I did not do was to work out and that is OK.  I need a day or two of, well, detox you might say and will then get into the swing of things.

My mother is still getting on my nerves. She just doesn't get it.  I am really beginning to wonder if buying a house with her was the right choice.  I know in the long run it is but it can be so stressful sometimes.

Back to the tapes/cd's julie sent.  I am so happy cuz one of the songs is ""60 Minute Man"".  I don't know how she managed it but it's a live recording.  SO COOL !!!!

I have been organizing all my Huey photos and articles. Been emailing them to Julie - she seems to like them.  It makes me so happy to be able to share my collection with someone who shares the same passion as me.

Watched the Daytona 500 today.  Good race.  I have a ""fantasy team"" thru ESPN.com.  of the 5 drivers I picked Dale won, Bobbi was 11th & Elliott Sadler was up there too.  2 other drivers were involved in wrecks and ended up towards the last places.  All in all a good start to the season.  I was worried with Michael wrecked it was such a mess but thankfully he walked away !!!

It turned out the morning was fine but the afternoon got very busy.  I am taking Jake to the dermatologist tomorrow for a follow-up on his excema.  The medicine seems to be helping but I don't want to have him on it for a long time.  Hopefully the doctor will say to cut back some. It doesn't make him sleep and he still wakes up a couple times a night.  A lot of it is him talking in his sleep but when he calls for mommy I go.  Sometimes it's just to adjust his covers and give a kiss, sometimes to give milk and sometimes by the time I get there he's back asleep.   In the end it's all ok but I am still getting run down - but I will perservere.

My mom is recovering from her surgery.  But she's being a pain the butt.  Mind you I know it's hard I had 2 hand surgeries but come on - I get up at 6:20, shower, get ready for work, wake my son, drop him off, work all day, pick up son, go to the grocery store to buy food for dinner, get home at 6:30pm and start dinner only to have her bitch about being hungry and when would dinner be ready.  I was so pissed but I made a lovely dinner and she thanked me.  I made food for her for tomorrow so she won't have to try to open things and am going to make breakfast as well as dinner for tomorrow - steak - yummy.  She goes to the dr on wednesday.  

Got a Huey promotional pic in the mail today.  It's cool.  Poor Chris his hair blends with the window almost perfectly and looks almost like he has no hair (the pic is black and white).  Julie will love this pic of bill he actually looks pretty handsome in it even though he has on shades.  I will try to email it to her this weekend.

Mom has been pushing to buy a dog.  I don't really mind but I would like to get my son potty trained before we get a dog as well.  I told her she gets to care for the dog and all it's messes as well.
We will see what she does.

I went to bed around 9/9:30 which for me is good (condsidering Jake has not been going to bed until 10/10:30 as of late).  I awoke at 6:30 to a stuffy nose.  I pray I am not coming down with a cold.  But with as much as I did last week I didn't have time for a cold so perhaps my body is just giving in now - I hope not. Loading up on vitamins :)

I watched the AT&T ProAM and saw Huey at least 3 times on it.  I have it on Tape and am going to send it to Julie.  She said she can do some editing.  That would be awesome!!!  Huey was 3rd in Celebrity closest to the tee - 7 inches.  I don't know if he's gonna make it into todays round but it's on at 3pm and I will watch/record.

I didn't take Jake to the Kids expo yesterday but am most definitly doing so today.  It opens at 10 am.  He will have a blast.  We went last year and he really enjoyed himself.  Now that he's a year older and bigger he should have even more fun.  More about that after we get home.

Making my famous breakfast today.  Eggs and steamed potatoes w/cheese.  Yummy - since I am going on WW next week this is one luxury I will have to give up since there is so much oil I wouldn't be able to eat anything else as this would take up all my points - Once I attain my weight loss goal I will reward myself with it again :)

all for now"

"event","It's been a fairly uneventful few days.  Work has been hectic.  The full moon has truely sent the whacko's out.  Not to mention that staffing has been a major issue this week.  Mom had surgery on her hand today and it resting.  Her hand is all bound up.  I am trying to keep Jake from pouncing on her (that is fun trying to stop him).  He's been pretty good so far.

Cute story.  I was working on a project for my uncle and Jake came and called me Miss Christine (his preschool teachers name).  I said to him that's not my name and asked him - what's my name.  I expected him to say mommy but he said Nanci.  I was cracking up laughing.  I did not expect him to call me by my proper name.  It was hysterical.

I am happy tomorrow is Friday.  Unfortunately, I am working Saturday.  So while, normally this would be the end of my work week it is not :(  I only have to work until 12:30 so that's not too bad.  I am then taking Jake to a Kid's Fest.  However, we are expecting 4-6 inches of snow tomorrow morning and it's going to turn into sleet and ice friday into Saturday so I may wait and take him Sunday.  Will just play that by ear.

Julie told me a friend of hers will see Huey in Atlantic City on the 14th.  So cool.  Julie offered to send a letter along with a package she was sending.  That was even better.  I emailed the same letter/poem I did in December, just edited it to be more current since there was not enough time for me to do much else.  The package was going out the next day.  I am grateful for that chance.  It's one of the sweetest offers I have ever received. I know Julie understands.  Her passion for Huey is as deep as is mine :)

All for now.

Off to bed."

"event","We were snowed in on Wednesday morning.  Winter Storm Connor as it was affectionately labeled.  We got over 12 inches of snow.  My office opened late which was great.  At 7:30 when the guy that does our plowing had not shown up I went ahead and got the snow blower out.  It took 10 minutes for me to crank it up.  Thankfully the snow was very light - couldn't even make snowball :( so it was relatively easy to clean up.  I enjoyed it but today I felt the repurcussions.  Especially in my right hand.  I was in so much pain (and for that matter still am) that I had to take a pain pill.  I don't like to do that too often but it was necessary.

Julie has introduced me to so many Huey Fans I can't keep up.  They all seem so incredibally nice.  I look forward to more chats.  

I got some vintage HLN stuff in the mail this week.  Included is the an article from Playboy - I couldn't believe it.  I never knew he did that interview.  Now I am on a search for the magazine.

I inadvertantly got a raise for myself this week.  It's not much - an extra $5 when I work Saturdays.  I was trying to get the increase for the girls that work on Saturdays normally.  Turns out one already is at the higher rate and the other in all honesty is always at work but is the weakest in the group and I could not justify an increase for her.  Since I am now the boss, my boss felt it appropriate to compensate me a little more.  It's no big deal either way since in the last 16 mo's since I have been manager I have only had to work 2 Saturdays.  It's not like it's a significant increase.  But I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.

I have not been faithful to my new years resolution.  I just can't concentrate on losing weight.  I think I am bored with Weight Watchers.  I need a jumpstart.  I am confident I can do it I am just not motivated.

I am still trying to convince my mom to go to Boston for the 8/21 show.  I think she will go - I hope she will go because I need her to watch Jake.  By then Jake will be over 4 years old and hopefully much easier to handle.  

I had chinese food for dinner.  My fortune says ""An old wish will come true"".  one of my lottery #'s on it is 6 (that's supposed to be Huey's lucky #).  I hope this is an omen that my wish to meet Huey will come true.  My fingers are crossed."

"event","Today we had a lunch at my house in celebration of my grandparents 61st wedding anniversary.  I put together a photoalbum containing photos of my grandparents children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.  They loved it.  I told my gram a fib in order to get to her photos in her house.  I told her that my son was making a picture album for his grammy and I needed pix's of her as a young girl.  Meanwhile I took pix of my grandparents and son on.  I took them to Walgreens, scanned them and made duplicates.  The album was a hit.  They both really loved it.  Unfortunately, my cousins (the girls) who also helped me could not attend as this was just planned last week.  But my uncles family and my cousin;s husband and 2 children did come.  The afternoon was awesome.  It was perfect and I am proud of it.  My mom was trying to tell me to get wine and beer.  I told her no.  She wanted me to have it for our guests (neither of us really drink).  I told her if they could not enjoy a couple hours w/out it then they have a problem.  In the end I won.  No one cared either which was great.  

Sometimes my mother tries to be something she's not.  It bugs the hell out of me but I get over it.  I hosted this party and other than my mother making some chicken I handled it and it went very smoothly.

Jake had a blast playing with his cousins.  They are both into the Land Before Time Videos.  My mom bought Jake all the little plastic toys and they play along with the videos.  It's so cute.  Jake fell asleep very early - THANKFULLY - so I have had a very pleasant evening. 

We took Jake to the Science Museum yesterday.  He really enjoyed himself.  We did not know what to expect and did not stay long.  My cousin was there with her 2 boys and it was too much.  I now have a membership for the next 12 mo's so will take Jake back often.
I am trying to get my mom to go to Boston on 8/21 for 2 reasons.  1) to take Jake to the science museum there (we get free admission now that we are members to this one) AND 2) HLN is there in 8/21 as well.  I will have to work on her for that one  but I think I can swing it.  I am staying at the Hotel in Ledyard for the show on 8/20 so we can stay there that night & go the next morning to boston.  It should only be a couple hours drive from there verses 3 from here.  We can plan other outings from there as well.  But there is a lot to do in Boston so we should be able to figure out lots of things to do.

I will have to keep working on her.  Plus, in case I don't meet Huey on 8/20 I would have another chance on 8/21.  But I am really trying for 8/20 as the 21st is very tentative.  My fingers are crossed!!!!

I met Vicki via Julie today.  She seems very nice.  We all had a very nice chat.  Julie is truely a wonderful person.  I hope to meet her someday.  Perhaps I can make my one other dream come true at the same time I meet her. Since she's planning a trip to California and I have always wanted to go.  I hope she will fill me in on her plans once set up and I can meet her and go to CA.  That would be cool. 

All for now.  Back to work tomorrow.  Thankfully, the rodent(gerble/hamster  whatever it is) goes back to Jake's school tomorrow.  Snow coming for tues/wed - 6-12 inches - yeah!!!"

"event","The last couple of days have been fairly routine.  I have been battling an awful stomach bug since last night and am as of right now just starting to feel better.  I was so - well frankly - gassy.  I was in my office spritzing airfreshener every 5 minutes.  The worst part was later in the afternoon I had an unexpected meeting which lasted an hour.  I felt like someone in a commercial.  UGH!!!

I had a blast on-line with everyone tonight.  I was chatting w/hueymad, catsby & kittenish.  I am still learning everyone's names - should be Julie, Jennifer & either vanessa or daisy not sure which or if both - I will have to clarify w/julie next time.  They are a great bunch of ladies.  Glad to have ""met"" them.  Julie's site really brings together people and she's a natural at the intro's.  

Tomorrow I take Jake to see the dinosaurs.  He will love it I hope.  
For the weekend we have taken home chi chi a gerbel or hamster (honestly don't know what it is).  I had forgotten they are nocturnal creatures.  I will be moving it downstairs after Jake goes to sleep.  For me to move it now he would have a fit."

"event","Well, Wednesday is nearly over.  I had so much fun on-line last night.  Julie conferenced me in with 4 other people.  They all know so much more than I do about HLN.  I can't comment about some if 'cuz I just don't know.  But it's ok because I can only learn. However,  I Love Huey and honestly - the music is awesome but I listen and go to the shows purely for Huey !!!

I picked up the photo reprints today for my grandparents anniversary gift.  I think this is going to be so awesome.  I had them put it on CD so I can just have copies printed anytime.  I am not sure if I can use it on the computer I will try to check over the weekend.

Work was smooth only one crisis and I resolved it fairly easily.  It's a good feeling to know I can handle most tasks.  I did have to ""tattle"" to the CFO.  He has a new hire and he made a mistake that caused paperwork not to be mailed and we were sitting on the deposit since 12/18 but it was just deposited 1/14/04.  That was way too long.  I know the guy is new and reminded his boss of that so mistakes are expected but money should not be sitting in the office that long.  Don't know what will happen.  We shall see.

Day 3 of my diet is going well.  I did not work out today because I just could not get up.  As it was I kept hitting the snooze button.
I have done it 2 out of 3 days so far so one day off is no big deal.  

Just want to say how happy I am to found new friends @ the HLN FanZone.  Everyone is so nice and helpful.  I am dissappointed that I still have not gotten a response from the Fan Club.  It's ok 'cuz I have the zoners for updates.  I feel like I am almost a member of the HLN Family.  

all for now - I am finishing up some work for my uncle so I can make some desperately needed cash for my going to the huey show.  The hotel and tix alone are gonna cost me over $200 - ouch - that hurts but is worth it!!!

I Love Huey !!!  :)"

"event","Well had my day in court today.  It's always stressful seeing my ex.  At least I don't have any feeling for him anymore (other than pity).  Seems his really hitting the bottom.  He's married w/a daughter now that is 18 mo's old and now they are living in a motel.
I think it's true because he gave me the phone # just in case he was arrested and there was a ""room #"".  It's too bad now rather than feeling vindicated I feel bad.

I suppose what goes around comes around and while I sometimes wished his world would crash I never thought this would be the result.  I just wished he would get given the same as he did me.  In someways he is receiving it but I hope he gets out of the mess because no one deserves it.

I was the only reason he was not arrested today.  I told the judge - to put him in jail defeats the purpose in coming to court.  I filed comtempt charges when I was receiving nothing but now that I am getting something, albeit not the full amount due, it's better than nothing.  And, to incarcerate would cause further difficulty for me.  He agreed and continued the case until March 9.

My letter to Huey was sent today.  I put a return env in there in hopes of getting a reply.  I read this tip somewhere and hope it works.

UGH - why won't my son make poop in the potty.  I am having the hardest time teaching him.  He will be 4 in June.  He understands the concept but just won't do it.  I have tried everything.  I am told when he is ready.  HE'S READY !!!! and so am I for that matter. 

I am almost done with my grandparents anniversary gift.  61 years of marriage on the 28th of this month.  That is incredible.  While I was scanning the pix today I saw me at 5 years old and my grandmother had misspelled my name.  I called her and teased her about it.   We had a good laugh.

Back to work tomorrow - ugh.  I wish I would hit the lottery so I would never have to work again !!!!

I Love Huey !!!!

7 mo's & 1 day until the show - can't wait !!!"

"event","Well today is over.  A fairly routine day.  A few minor bumps in the road at work.  Can't every make one co-worker happy she was just born
cranky.  Oh well, her problem not mine.  She will have to adapt to the changes or move on.  I am betting on the adaption because she is too old to look for a new job.  She is close to retiring (2-3 years).

Day one of the diet went well.  I consumed all my water - yuck !!! And, I worked out!!! Now for tomorrow.  I have my hearing tomorrow with my ex - re: childsupport this should be fun.

I did not hear Huey on the radio today - bummer.  So of course I am wearing out my CD right now.  

Slammin' is playing.  Great tune.

I saw my friend Julie said she wants to come to the US to the Atlantic City show of HLN.  I wish I could go too but unfortunately I can't meet her this time.  Hopefully, sometime in the future.  If she does come I will try my best.  It might be a 24 hour trip - take the train down, visit, see the show and take the train back.  That probability is very minimal.  But I will see the boys in August that is for certain.

I have to get my son ready for bed.  He was all settled and then his grandmother got him all wound up - UGH!!!!"

"event","I have a new goal in mind and it's sort of related to Huey.  At least he and a picture of me at 17 is my motivation.   Unfortunately the weight monster got a hold of me over the years and I gained a lot of weight.  My goal is to lose 60 pounds by 8/20/04. The HLN concert in CT.  I have an outfit already picked out and it's hanging on my closet as inspiration.  I also found a picture of me at 17 (and skinny) that's my second inspiration.  Of course, I am really doing this for myself but I need the extra little umph.  I plan on setting mini goals as I go.  my 1st goal is to lose 15 pounds by the end of Feb and workout a minimum of 4 times per week.  I know I can do this.  I did it in the past.  I just need to get my act together.  

I met some new friends over the web recently and it's been very nice.  They are fans of HLN as well.  It's nice to meet people w/similar interest.  Of course right now I am ""over-the-top"" about Huey.  I have been a fan for 20 years and am on a mission to meet him. The concert is 8/20 and my birthday is 8/25.  That would be the best birthday present I could give myself.  I am working very hard at making this dream come true.  If it doesn't happen then I will be sad but I couldn't be as sad as I was last year.  

My son got a haircut yesterday.  When his hair is longer he looks so much like me but when it's short he looks like his father.  I go back to court on tuesday for child support the judge threatend to put him in jail last time if he was not current on the payments by tues.  As far as I am concerned I am getting money now and that is most important.  Jake's daycare cost me a$853 a month and it's a killer.  I had someone offer me $3000 for my car today.  I would have sold it if I could afford another car.  This is a good car.  It's 14 years only but just turned 74,000 miles and other than a few minor boo boos is in outstanding condition.  If I send Jake to private school I will buy a new car in 9/2005  otherwise, if I send him to private school (which is what I desperately want to do) I will just live with what I have for as long as I have too. I can only hope there are scholarships available for me.

I am working on a photo album for my grandparents.  Their 61st anniversary is the 28th and my cousins and I have assembled pictures of ourselves, spouse and kids.  We are putting together a master album for them to peruse.  Also, I took some pictures of my grandparents when they were 1st married and am going to put them in there as well.  I have one of my grandfather at 18 and he had HAIR so cool.  He's been bald all my life (except for the patch of hair that goes from ear to ear around the back of his skull.  It's so funny to see him with hair.  I never pictured it.  I am so thankful they are still with me and healthy.  My grandmother just turned 83 and grandfather 85.  Gram was very sick last year with an unknown ailment which was making her very weak.  She passed out a couple times.  I am just grateful the episodes are over (at least as much as I am told).

Tomorrow is the start of my new day and my new goals.  One step at a time !!!

I Love Huey Forever !!!!"

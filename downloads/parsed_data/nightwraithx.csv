Done most of my Christmas shopping too. It's starting to get pretty cold, already had our first snow of the season though it barely if at all touched the ground.  Well anyways, I have a few things to get done, shall talk with you all soon :)"

"event","Spring seams to have come a little early this year.  Buds are already sprouting on trees and flowers alike.  Its getting warm enough that I wont be able to wear my favorite leather coat, oh the horror HeHeHe.  Alas the sun is starting to shine and I'll have to hide under my sunglasses.  Its times like these that I feel very much like a vampire.  Oh well, that's my life for you.

Now if I can just get off my ass of late and get the laundry done.  On top of that I've been having a major entertainment problem as of late.  Absolutely nothing has been satisfying my need for more than a few short minutes. My guess is that I need something completely new to do.  As far as I know it doesn't need to be totally radically dangerous or foreign, just different.

Course it doesn't help that until then, my sleeping habits have been changing constantly, I keep watching countless DVDs to pass the boredom, have been eating food that just isn't good for me to the point I'm craving salads now (not that that's a bad thing to crave).  Anyways, hopefully I'll find something soon so I can get back to normal.

Talk with you later,

"event","Well its been crazy just after Xmas time here in Bellingham.  We didn't have a white Xmas but the snow sure came in after.  It started off fairly nice, a little snow that didn't really stick at all.  A few days later the snow just started coming and coming.  I had to take Ashley home and managed not to be able to get around a turn near her house so had to walk the rest of the way.  I spent the night there cause had no chance of getting back home in those conditions.  The next day I managed to get home fairly easily.  Ashley came over again and wasn't too hard to get her home but the next day I couldn't get even close to taking her home.  Her step-dad had to get his 4x4 Suburban and pick us both up cause we were definitely stuck.  So I spent the night over there again.  The next day we went and dug my car out of the snow and went home.  Later on that night Ashley's step-dad came and picked her up cause there was no chance I could do it. These past couple days I've been able to do the driving but only cause there's no new snow to speak of but supposedly tonight and tomorrow there is supposed to be a lot more snow to endure. The snow sure is picture worthy but I just can't stand ice and the cold!!!  Too much Californian blood in my system still but I am adjusting more and more.  I was walking in the snow to Ashley's house (see above) and the cold wasn't bugging me which is very unusual.
Well guess I've babbled on about the weather too much as it is.  Talk with you all later :)

I can't wait for Matrix: Reloaded to come out in a few days.  It looks so good!!!  Course I'm a Matrix fan to start with so perhaps I'm a bit biased.

Can't wait for upcoming films that aren't so close to release either and here they are:  Spiderman 2, Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King, Star Wars - Episode III, Time Line, Dare Devil 2, X-Men 3, Harry Potter 3, The Matirx 3, and there is likely some others that while big on my mind just aren't coming to mind HeHeHe anyways say it with me...

"event","Mostly due to one simple reason. I FORGOT!!! Yes, I have literally forgotten about Live journal.  Don't know what made me remember this time but I have and so I'm posting before I forget once again.  Nothing new has really happened.  But I will say this.  For all you RPG lovers out there, you just HAVE to go play ""Suikoden III"" for the PS2.  It has to be one of the greatest RPG ever to date.  Endless hours of play time, tons of chars to play as, mini games, things to find, diverse battles/tactics and monsters, Great story line, side quests, Mass scale type battles, intrigue and mystery galore.  You name it, its there and the graphics are very good to boot. Perhaps that's the reason for forgetting about Live Journal.  Well Anyways, back to gaming for me.

MISSION:  You are to go seek Suikoden III and evaluate it for yourself.  If you find it interesting, BUY IT!!!  Its far too long of a game to rent, so might as well pay the, I think it was $20 to purchase. Enjoy, I know I have."

Its kinda like being restless, NEEDing to do a lot of things, but having nothing to do, so I try and stay up as long as I can to do stuff and I do all that I can think of and nothing satisfies it.  Course then I get tired and go to bed and try to get comfy but I can't sleep for several hours cause I'm wondering what I had forgotten to do or try.  So the next day I start all over and try as many different things as I can and once again nothing works.  My guess is I just need something not just new but RADICALLY new to satisfy this need of mine but what this completely new thing is, I sure don't know what it is.

THE  MISSION:

Whoever reads this, if you have any ideas for stuff that either perhaps is common for you but different for others or just something you think I'd like, please tell me what it is.  I really need a change or addition to my life or I shall go insane for sure (well further insane than currently) If you find something that I just love to do, I'll be your new best friend *all smiles*

I'm also having a entertainment slump.  I need new forms of entertainment or at least new forms of old entertainment.  Something to get the blood flowing, heart pounding, or at the very least intrigue me to no end.

You're excited about life and in touch with yourself and nature. Tell me, do I have this straight?

Virtues: You appreciate humor like none other. Puns might even spark laughter in you (TEHY R FUNNI). You seek adventure and connection with your surroundings. You seek friends who will not only share laughs with you but actually form a deep bond of trust and empathy beneath the surface. You look for adventure and courage in people, and variation is necessary to keep you under control. You see yourself as multi-faceted, so you need people who can see you in your many lights. You're constantly trying to figure yourself out while analyzing the people around you. Silly, silly people.

Aspirations: You can't decide what you want to be yet, but you know you want it to be adventures and interesting, with constant changes. You don't know what love will do for you yet, but it's competing with adventure for a place in your heart. An internal conflict has begun: can you be a successful worker, lover, and parent all at once?

Quirks: Noise of any sort is irritating when you're in the mood. Smacking gum, loud chewing, humming- it's about as pleasing as bodily noises. You dislike emaciated people because of jealousy and just plain disgust. You're a procrastinator but a hard worker, too.

Factors: You need constant attention and support. You're high-maintenance, but a great, reliable friend. Nature needs you and you need nature; it's helped thus far, so keep in touch with the outside world.

Future: Who knows! You absolutely need constant change, so vacationing is surely in the cards. Will you settle down or not? Love will find you eventually, as it does to everyone. Will you choose the sweet home life or the rewarding busy-bee life?

(Night Wraith X note:  Umm.....I'm not really a nature fan or adventurous..okay so I Like adventure...just never find much...rest is kinda like me I think..or not...just doesn't quite feel totally right though)

Meanwhile I started my Internship on Monday of last week (I forget the numeric date but...) Has been hard work since I have only a lunch break for 7 hours, course today its going to be a full 9 hours with the same lunch break so am going to be tired.  I know there are those that work 12 hour or more days but 8 is the longest I have as yet and if you haven't done it or gotten used to it...its quite tiring.  Wouldn't be so tiring if I wasn't getting sick though... Either that or I'm actually getting stressed.  Can't remember ever being stressed before in my life... so maybe it is stress and not getting sick.  Either way I'm quite busy, and am looking for relief."

Sensitive and artistic. You're as nice as they come, but a little on the defensive and jealous side. You yearn for what you (think) you can't have, but you're willing to take a risk to get it. Once you've put yourself out there, however, you don't deal with it well. Your sense of timing, however cute that 1:37 thing was, is really off. Once you learn to not be so singularly focused, you'll be more susceptible to cues."

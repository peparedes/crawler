"event","I have come to the conclusion that my parents are bigger slackers then i am. As most know im stuck in the rut of i've done nothing for so long i have no ambition to really do anything. I figured that by now they would be screaming and yelling at me everyday to get a job or at least start charging me rent to live here. As of yet nothing really happens other then the occasionally yelling. Therefore i'm gonna pack up all my shit and move out in hopes that w/ the responsibility of having to pay bills regularly that i will get motivated to do something?????

So this will prolly be my last post for quite sometime. Since they won't have internet where i am moving in & i don't even have my own computer. 

Peace Out Later kk zonk!"

1. I am out of shape.(yes im not fat but there is a difference)

2. I tend to over do things.(Like most ppl would start w/ a small jog but not me i go on a super long one)

3. I come back 2/3 dead, take a shower and my parents have the AC up all the way.(Talk aboot getting a cold)

4. My feet hurt.(I should buy some actual running shoes instead of my slip-ons)

5. I smoke a pack a day.(Need i say more)

6. The roads i took are completely infested w/ dogs.(So i got chased by 3 dogs. Thank God they were all fat and old)"

Another Morning Stoner 
by And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead


Are you asleep, are you in a dream?
The copper shades of a morning
Distant lights beckon & fade
Unwritten songs of another day

I fear that you would never be
Every song in the world for me
I took your hand, led you astray
You cursed the worlds I longed to save

Is heaven to you a perfect place?
The look of sorrow on a sufferer's face?
A field of lives to sow and reap
That some of us will never see

Why is it I don't feel the same?
Are my longings to be blamed
For not seeing heaven like you would see;
Why is a song a world for me?

What is forgiveness?
It's just a dream.
What is forgiveness?
It's everything.


If only i had a nice fatty on me.

Oh and here is Jim on women.
""....who cares if their hot. Just as long as their bit-n-easy.. thats how i like em""
"" i meant big-n-easy"" ""big-n-easy or big-n-sloppy"""

We do expect another good crowd though, not as big as last time caz we don't even know where the fuck all those ppl came from. Since there is another party at Corey's we expect it will be a little thinner which is OK caz we don't need 60 ppl running around we don't know anyway:) Start around 9 or so come early if u wanna help set up, but NOT before 6 please.

I've been noticing how much my job has changed me and my process of thinking. EX: The fact that any young girl that isn't fat is all of a sudden ""hot"" or beautiful whichever you prefer to use. Also i seem to have a little negative energy towards college ppl, which is really horrible but i always seem to gravitate towards the ppl that work when i go to parties. I also(although it seems hard to believe)give less of a fuck about anything then ever before. ppl seem to make me mad easier and i really don't like to be violent. Which has only happened once but thats still to much:(

( Out of context side note: i think i have a serious addiction to the RHCP and JF. But i have no idea why other then they both sound so organic when they play.) So back to my wanting to do everything and doing nothing. Well i think i'll just make a list of the things so i can look at them for myself.   
1  GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS TOWN
2  GET A JOB I LIKE
3  MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE( i need to do this real soon)
4  PARTY LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER
5  START A BAND(impossible to do in this area everything is Metal or Christian)
6  REALLY GET TO KNOW SOME PEOPLE I HAVE BEEN ALIENATED FROM(over the last couple months)
7  GO TO SCHOOL AND STUDY PHILOSOPHY(for no reason other then i find it very interesting but don't want a job in it)
8  FIND A NICE GIRL(another yet impossible task b/c almost all girls,except a few thank god, are all whores i think its the redneckness)
9  BE A BUM FOR A COUplE YEARS
10 BECOME A VEGETARIAN(not gonna happen in this house)
11 FIND MYSELF
12 GET HEALTHY KIND OF GOES WITH 10 BUT MORE IN A PHYSICAL WAY
13 BE MORE CONFIDENT(in all aspect of life)
14 FIND EQUILIBRIUM, PEACE, AND MY PLACE IN THE WORLD
15 PAINT
16 WRITE MORE BOTH MUSICALLY AND IN PERSONAL JOURNALS 
17 TRAVEL THE WORLD(accompanied w/ one of or all of my best friends)
18 ___________________________
19 JUST LIVE MORE

Thats all i can think of at the moment. Alot of those contradict each other so nothing makes sense as usual i'm a zest-pool(is that the word im thinking of?)of random dumbness w/ incomplete thoughts, knots and holes in my brain.I tell myself life is hopeless but know that it is full of opportunity and craziness. I think there comes a time when you have to decide to take what life gives you or make yourself. I'm still confused by my wanting to do so how can i choose??

If your wondering about the whole French thing that faded after if took me like 30 mins. to download a couple of clips, you know here's the words now repeat. That was just a pain in the ass. Don't worry i am now interested in writing. No not myself writing or others writing, actually not even reading writing but in the actual process of a person writing. This is also getting me to rethink everything in life. Not just like what religion am i if any, but if marriage or love are actually important? Or is it a preconceived notion placed inside my head, why do i write left to right, why is it that the alphabet and most numbers all are designed for right handed people. And many other philosophical ??. Lots of odd things going on in my head space, not sure where these ? are going to lead if anywhere. I have ? and many notions to figure out."

"event","Well second night DandA free and I think i do feel better, yet my heart aches a little... It seems as if i can't relate to my friends as much or as well when i am sober. Also conversation is at a complete loss. Not everyone but with some. I am finding it frustrating having to hear the same things repeated 2 or 55 million times. The conversations that do take place are about being fucked up, how fucked up we are, drugs; where and when to get them, and ""bitches and hoes"". In case you don't know I don't have much of a sex drive so these things mean less then nothing to me really.

Makes me think of that line from the Smashing Pumpkins ""and our lives are forever changed we will never be the same the more you change the less you feel"" And if I had stayed the little church follower geek would I be where i am now. No. It really is the small things in life that matter. Not saying that straying from the religion I was raise on is or was a bad thing just an example really. 

The small things matter and possessions mean less to me more then ever now. Sometimes when i pick up my guitar and play it sounds empty to me. Which is scary because it makes me feel as though i am empty. I am finding pleasure in little things more and more. It is astonishing just the joy you get when your cold and rap a blanket around oneself or just go for a walk. I think i could spend the rest of my life alone with no one, no home and no stuff and be happy just wandering the earth. Is that normal?? I'm guessing not but i have really taken to heart the fact that when i die nothing gets to go with me NOTHING. 

It is strange how easily we attach to little things and if they aren't around it drives us crazy. We may not even need it but notice it is not where it should be and it make us insane.
Now for something completly different.

"event","Well it seems that last night sucked again. OH WELL!!! Today has gone pretty good. In the AM i read up on Da Vinci some more and am on yet again another worthless quest. Oh such great joy are these stupid ideas of mine that slowly help to pass my time. I ran into some people today i hadn't seen for awhile so which was nice. Youngs seemed well in spirit and all good with him and Amy. Great for him! I also saw Jenny when i was walking she only waved though so that was a bit of a disappointment, but still i think it was nice. 

Also i have started the slow task of turning ""straightedge"". For those of you who don't know the phrase it was coined by Ian M. of Fugazi(Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In) pretty much it is a clean lifestyle. No drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or meat. After much thought and time to slow down and get it out of my system i have crossed the first 2 off the list. The meat thing i won't get around to until i move out of the house propably, and the tabaccoo well i like smoking alot and i truly think all this U.S. VS Big Tobacco stuff is bullshit so i slightly don't want to quit. But it is starting to get old it just seems like a waste and if im not drinking i think it will fade out quickly, if i can find something to do on break at work.

Other then that i guess i am just really enjoying today maybe because it was nice out and i spent the day walking around town w/ friends.

"event","Here i am once again it seems people have proved to be assholes. i have found only one and one true friend which resides outside of my bloodline.

 I guess i am to be eaten by old age like a young fat child devouring pudding, who has yet to learn that the world does in many ways judge by your looks. So away the child will eat. First till he is satisfied, then because of boredom, then because he is dissatisfied, and then because he has nothing but the food. Food for his stomach,food for his soul,food his sense of being, food being his passion. Food.  

Everyone has their food. I only wish i knew what mine was...

"event","Over most of my life i have been totally against taking pictures i always believed that if something was important you would remember it. As life goes by though i find i partied to hard, and myself in a job where my brain goes unused and simply strays around in thought about everything that nobody wants to talk about. Examples: meaning of life,why am i here doing this, if i wasn't here what would i be doing, why can't i live in a different simpler day or age.  

Well I recently was at work trying to remember the name of someone that i have very fond memories of but couldn't. It seemed odd that i couldn't remember, then i realized i didn't remember what she really looked like either(go figure)it was just fuzzy details and i wished i had a photo to help me remember. So i believe that from now on i will carry a camera(one of those crappy little one time use deals)with me when i party or go to where people are at(so always i guess). Next time i see you i'm gonna take a picture.

Anyway i don't know why i even care really, i guess i am really set on going to NY or somewhere still and getting the hell out of this place.I KNOW I AM RAMBLING NOW.

It's weird, i think there is some kind of void in this place. Its like yesterday everybody was complaining about how horrible this place was and they all were going to get out of here as soon as possible. And now we all work in lame corp. factories and nobody but me wants to leave. Some don't even leave their house unless they are going to work or to get Rolling Rock, Camels, or some stupid drug. It kind of pisses me off esp. when one was like ""well if you leave and get set up somewhere and 1: can find me an apartment, 2: 40 hr a week job, and a 3:place to skateboard, then i'll be there man."" It's like so i'm going to go pick up and leave everything behind and then if i found someplace i'm happy and look around for your stupid shit then you will move in. Its like he is missing the whole point in leaving.

Well i'm gonna stop now before i get pissed. It's a good thing i get to work 2nd today.

"event","well i had a shitty night. My boss caught rumors of me conspiring to quit(GREAT!). He also warned me that if ""U quit and i'll will track you down like a dog and fuck you like one too. Without the use of vaseline."" And that is a direct quote!!! So i think i'm gonna have to kill people if i wanna quit and live for over a week. Otherwise they(IP)'ll will send assassins to come track me down and do ""BAD STUFF"".  So what a bunch of a-holes. Oh well me and my fellow workers are all pissed, so tonight we call in, unless they don't work, and we get wasted.

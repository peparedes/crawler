"event","After a night like last night, or even this weekend for that matter has really taught me who people truly are. Fake. Purely fake. 

Children, you are childish. Please grow up, both sides of you. I am honestly amazed of the mentality that you have. I don't think there is one. I know the story, I know the facts. I was there. Don't try to persuede me otherwise like you have already. My friends might be childish at times resorting to violonce to solve things, but you took it too far. You took it too far right when you told me to get out of the house because those kids were going to die and not have a bone in their body left. You took it too far when you stated that the house was ""going to get sprayed."" I stayed. I stayed because you're ridiculous, and by saying you're going there tonight to ""fuck shit up.""(!?!?!?) Honestly, grow the fuck up. Nobody cares anymore about the situation. Or about you. You are taking it too far and I fear for the safety of others now. 

Tania, I'm not mad at you. I defended you even after you had left. I am irritated because you tend to choose boys over your friends all the time. I'm used to it, as you know I'm used to a lot of things by now. This happens to be one of those things I've just accepted. I already know if you read this you'll denfend Matt, that's fine. I'm not mad at you. I expect that from you. Although, I already know that you'll take this the wrong way.

As for the usual one, fuck you. You're a fucking liar. I am never speaking to you again and I mean it this time. This was the last time I was made to look like an idiot and believe your fucking lies.
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me 987568 times, shame on me one fucking million times.

I'm done feeling dumb.
I'm done with people being fake.
I'm done with people.

All I've ever wanted was for someone to make me real. And make me feel real. That is obviously not the case anymore. I don't want anyone anymore.

I'm that one girl you hear about that continuously gets fucked over by the people she loves the most. My name's Nina. What's up?

This is not a, ""Aw poor me post."" I honeslty don't give a fuck anymore. I haven't for a long fucking time. I'm used to it. The feeling is numb to me. I'm beginning not to care about anyone anymore. As bad as that sounds. I don't care anymore. 

Me putting this in my journal for anyone to see is an example of me not caring anymore.

Let the madness begin. <3"

I have more random pictures. I just have no time nor patience to put those up as well. They'll be on here eventually though. &hearts;

So I had kiloids cut of of my right ear on Saturday. It was disgusting, a bit painful, and..disgusting. I got all my jewelery changed in my ears though. Now they're all pretty and colorful.. and clean most importantly.

I saw Miss Katelyn yesterday and she gave my the best christmas gift EVER. <3

<i>but</i>..
then i find that wesley is in town <b>right now as we speak.</b> this kid has totally made my summer now. and even if the rest of the summer sucks, it's okay, because wesley got to come to vegas. it's just really sad that it had to be on these circumstances, but i think it's vital that wes is just with his cool vegas friends now. we make sure to take care of our wessy bessy.<3
i've had so many different emotions today it's crazy. 
between this and tom and everything, i swear.. i'm on fucking cloud nine. <3"

"event","So I sit here thinking about everything that has changed in the past year. In merely a year, everything is the exact opposite and at the same time I love it, but at the same time I hate it. I have never been the type of peron that does adapt well to change in any shape or form at all. I always like things to stay the way that they are. Around this exact time last year, I met someone that was nothing short of amazing (<i>yes, that's you tom</i>), formed new friendships while others faded away. And yes, it was nice that I was with Jason and absolutely nothing was wrong between us. Everything was perfect. I can remember Mike and I staying up on the phone until god knows when EVERY NIGHT watching t.v. together and making up spanish subtitles and laughing until it hurt and we were both in tears. I mean sure, right now isn't all bad, i have gained back my brittany and everything is okay in my world, and I don't mean to sound selfish but it is simply not good or nearly as good as it was last year. Which makes me miss just about everything and think about everything. Yes, it makes me miss Mike. It makes me miss Jason. It makes me miss Steve. It makes me miss last summer and all of the wonderful things that I learned and experienced last year. To put it simply, I have been embracing the past for quite sometime and I can't bring myself to reality. I don't really think that I want to, but I have to. All good things come to an end, and maybe it's time now that I accept it, no matter how hard a reject that concept. I just can't help that I can remember when it was good and I am left with all of the memories. I know I won't forget a thing. I'm simply left here constantly dreaming. All that love that I had was too good to last, and I'm too old to dream anymore. This whole life is too good to last, yet I'm too young to care. I'm stuck. And I overanalyze and overanalyze and drive myself crazy time and time again. I'm just tired.  My mind is so disorganized and chaotic. I suppose I just need everything to get back on track again. This might not even making sense anymore, I won't re-read it though, because then I won't post it. My ramblings you've just witnessesd are just an example of a small portion of what goes through my head constanty. I guess i'll get over it.

ah lovely. just lovely.
so that was my big event for the day, i battled with death. i'm like a super hero now. i can probably defeat even spider man now.
i'm obviously going crazy.
so i've been sick just about all summer so that hasn't really been fun. who knew you can get sun poisoning? of course, that's what <i>i</i> get. followed by 46 days of fevers and sore throats. 
magical, simply magical.
so, august 16 is a long ways away..brittany, get your ass back home. thank you.
adam and i found out that only snoop dog informs him when his phone is ringing. it's fucking amazing. i only wish i was that lucky.

i've also come to the realization that nobody really cares anyway.

other random things that i have realized;
i have to get the blonde out of my hair.
i have to talk to jason.
some people have to grow up.
how tired i am of everyone.
sometimes your best friends aren't who you think they are.
who my friends really are.

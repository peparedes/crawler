Have a rescue dog who is too wild...he obviously didn't have an owner with any control over him.  We've gotten damange to three doors from his scratching....tore out the screen to the back door.  Hopefully he'll move to Alabama next week end.  Mira will be so happy to be an only dog again."

"event","Got my undergrad class stuff done and almost ready to go for next week.  Now I need a flunky to do about an hour's worth of copying.  I have everything in a folder for each week, but need copies of all the handouts......and since this is an editing class, there are lots of handouts.  Amazing how long it takes to set up to do essentially the same course as I taught last semester.

Now on to the graduate class.......document design or how to make technical inforation look good and enhance people to read it .....hummm, wonder if I should put that on the overhead the first day?

My shoulder's been hurting.  Chiropracter thinks it's a nerve problem in my neck.  I get tingles in my hand and shoulder.

I bail out a rescue old english sheepdog from the Memphis shelter (total deathtrap of a shelter) tomorrow.  Of course, they have to spay the dog, so I don't get her until late next week.  Hope my OES likes this one better than the last girl.  Mine dog gets low marks in ""plays well with others""  I think she's more the Cartman type."

"event","Saturday night and nothing to do.  Wife went to a basketball game with a friend.  I could care whether or not I go to a basketball game.

My dog is getting stiff when she gets up each morning.  She's 7 and half now, poor thing is starting to get old.  Dogs get old too quick.  Their too sweet and loving to have to die after only 10-12 years.  My last (and only other dog) lived to almost 16.  I hope this one lives that long."

"event","Got a new collection of books via FedEx today....academic type books on rhetoric of science.  My wife wonders why I read that stuff for fun.  Of course, now I can claim that I'm reading it as part of keeping up in my field.....sort of both.  Getting the books was a pain since I forgot to enter the house number when I ordered them.  I live on a 2 block street, but still.....  Called FedEx and yelled at the automatic system after it didn't hear all million digits of the tracking number.  It kept telling me to read at least 9.  Finally got a nice *real* person who took down my house number and a couple hours later, my box arrived.

Just looked at skunk prints on ebay.  Didn't buy anything.  I like antique skunk prints, but then I collect skunks.  Figure old prints at least have more value than a basic figurine.   Usble skunk puppets are also nice.....my first skunk, which I bought when I was in college, was a puppet."

"event","Too long since the last update.

Is it normal to be sitting at a computer on a Saturday night listening to a total hogpog of songs (just went from George Strait to Grand Funk) and doing work.  Uploading files for an program to process.....it takes text files and calculates a bunch of coherence values from the text.  there are about 80 files and each one takes 3-4 minutes to process.  Oh, the things I do for publishing journal articles.  Of course, this also has to be done soon since a student is writing an honor's thesis on this data before it becomes a journal article.   And she has to finish it in 6 weeks in order to graduate.

One friend told me she had seen CSI and the furry episode.  It sounded rather balanced...better than most furry press."

"event","Have an academc  journal article that has been accepted almost fully revised and ready to go back.  If you read technical communication journals, you can read the article this summer....about tables on a Palm PDA.

Working a new business card.  Have the design in PageMaker but can't get the logo in from Photoshop and then output to PDF without getting all screwed up.  Lots of gray garbage appears around the logo.  Probably from having to resize it (reduce it) after the inport.  Crazy since the image is the right size, but at 300 dpi in Photoshop.  In PageMaker, it's huge."

"event","Went off to the mall to get my wife a teddy bear from one of those ""you pick it and get it stuffed here' bear stores.  It was a Christmas present.  She picked out the bear and then had to buy a pink t-shirt, black leather  miniskirt, and saddle shoes for the bear.  At least she didn't want to go find a matching outfit. (not that she wouldn't look like in a black leather mini-skirt.)"

"event","Killing time for my wife to come home and before getting ready for New Years Eve party.  Going to a fancy hotel and enjoying one of the better bands in Memphis....I least I think so.  Good music and short skirts on the lead singers.

Should walk the dog, but the park is too wet for her to run in.  Guess I'll wait until closer to leaving time.  She'll be alone for about 6 hours as it is.

Listening to a strange mix of music:  Boston, Alabama, Ernest Tubb, Bangles, Bob Segar"

"event","Well another semester of teaching is done.  And one student has said she's appealing the F.   In a distance ed course, she turned in one assignment in the first half of the term, the mid-term, and then asked (in the last week) if she could turn in the other assignments.  I said yes, since there were some other students turning in work late (something I may never do again for anyone).  She turns in 3 of 4 assignments, but not the biggest one.  The policy statement says that all four must be turned in or the grade is an F.   And she's appealing because I allowed her to waste her time on doing the work when I intended to fail her anyway (at least that is her claim).  The amazing thing is that she seems to think that everyone will feel sorry for her when she explains how she waited for the end of the term to do the work, and then didn't have time to do it all.

Lazy day tommorow.  High point will be getting a rental car for a trip to the outlaws for Christmas; leave early Saturday.  Think I'll sleep in."

"event","I've been drinking so much coffee since I discovered Mom is not the only one who knows how to make it. Now I'm out and several 7-11 trips have had to be made. If I had the time, I would go to Kroger. If i werent lazy, I'd stitch this time together and save the trouble of more trips had... and also buy toilet paper as, after resorting to anything porous, we're now on shortage with an entire line of paper products. 
I have so many things to do, so many people to see. 
Ways to save time
drink coffee whilst buying coffee
Not buy coffee, Not drink coffee because I'll waste the time of peeing/pooping coffee out (and you dont have tee pee!)
drink coffee whilst peeing/pooping old coffee out (again...)

I want to get one of those fancy front-side baby-carrying contraptions and tailor it snuggly for my Mac. Then work in grocery store... work on the way to the coffee maker... work on the toilet (I already do that...)
This may be hazardous for pedestrians, grocery carts, and the two cats I narrowly avoid stepping on in my house several times a day. I wouldn't mind so much if it happened- no one tell my roommates. 

Now it couldn't be any more obvious I'm avoiding something..."

"event","Last friday was fun. People came over. We roasted marshmallows and then sat on the porch while it hurricaned outside. HFS was awesome. Seeing the Cure was unbelievable... and Modest Mouse. Epic everything. 
Oh, mom called- 20 miles down 66, said, ""Katy, where are you going? I KNOW you're not going shopping."" ha ha ha. But all was well. 
Wednesday I went to the park and it lame. 
Today was ""Spirit Day"" at school. We had an awards assembly and then games and such. I thought I'd let up a little on my usual relentless ""fuck the system!!!!!"" attitude and enjoy the tie dye and free ice cream. And besides, they made a grilled cheese for the vegetarian.  

Everyone tells me that I spend too much time with Zach... and that I'm leading him on. That may be true... But I know I'll just screw things up so I'm going to leave it at that. Besides, its almost summer, I don't want a relationship. complications.
anyway, Daryl and Jamie are on the verge of breaking up. I'm not supposed to know this, but I do, and its very very strange. I never thought they would and I dont know what to think of it. I like them both... just... separately. 
     Tomorrow is Newtown... I was looking forward to it, but I dont think it will be as fun now with these new vibes. We're going anyway. I guess its better than doing nothing, such as  tonight, though by choice.
I feel everything coming to a halt around me. 
I  have  3  more  years  of  high  school. But it just wont be the same. Cleaning out my room yesterday and going through all of the notes passed in class and 5 billion pictures. It seems like everything we did was so simple but I cant remember if this is true or not. I always remember things, not feelings. It distorts the time. Its kind of upsetting how everything has changed this past year but I guess its normal and I should get used to change. I'm pretty much happy with my life right now. I guess, just, with school ending... I dont know how to feel about a lot of things. 
this is long... and I should study."

They're the only 2 of my friends that actually can enjoy a time like that. And can actually carry on a good conversation with. I love Jamie to death, I really do... but shes really not the best at that. However, half of what we talked about was deciding on if should put things on the official with Zach. ah, that is so scary to say!

--3 weeks of school left. I cant believe it. Seriously, this year has flown by. And I dont have plans for this summer, at all. No beach trips so far. summer school...

It was a lot better than I thought it would be except that freaking Zach and Daryl only danced like twice the whole night. I was jamming out with Jamie though. We party boy'd Cassie and Evan. hah, good times. Paul and Jessie can really get down too. ;)
Afterwards it was to Jamie's to change and 7-11 for coffe and Adam and Shawn.
-AfterProm at the rec center... boring. Jamie and I were too grumpy to enjoy anything. We would have bowled if there were lanes open. Devin was there for a while. 
Then there was breakfast at the truck stop, the only place open 24 hours around here. That was probably the most fun of the night. Jamie and were REALLY hyper after our 3rd cup of coffee and replaced our grumpiness with stupidity. Then to Walmart for no apparent reason, and then Zach took me back to Jamies where I finally got some sleep. 
Looking back, it was pretty fun, even if I didnt think so at the time. 
2 people had my dress though. damn. 

This weekend... Apple Blossom... I think. We dont have school friday for the end of the 6 weeks. I failed math already.. for the semester. looks like summer school for meee. bah"

We also go our report cards today...
Theatre Arts-87%
Algebra-81%
English-96%
Science/smoot-78%

I swear... Science is so easy... but everyone gets horrible grades. 
I mean, we have like 10 people that failed that are in our class. 


Anyway, the game was muddy,wet and cold as hell but yet really really fun. We picked up Jamie and we snuck in-but it wasnt really sneaking in because they werent taking money anymore (we were late.) Everyone was there... including, Ash, Devin, Wes, Sam, Zach, Daryl, and even Aaron actually came...
And then afterwards everyone went to 5th quarter. 
And I talked to Kelly... which was... weird. 
Actually it wasnt that weird because I was really hyper, and when I'm hyper I can talk to almost anyone. 
But it wasnt like we were having a conversation or anything.. just, talking.
But I also talked to her on the phone last week at Jamie's for quite a while...
OH! Heather Riggleman was there... and she wouldnt talk to anyone. 

Anyway, good night. Just what I needed. 

Tomorrow I'm going to Jamie's at 12...and from there...I have no idea. Jamie and Daryl wanna do something with Brendan and I, i think. but, well...

Then I called Ash and told her I was going with him... even though I was supposed to go with her and her anti-ride. She told me she'd keep trying to get a ride, and call me. 
So I go to Mema's, and she takes me to Emi's at 5. We're about 10 minutes into the drive, and Emi says she kind of wished we were going to the Berryville show because Dan, Lindsey, and some others were going to be there... and I was like, ""what? Arent we going to Berryville?"" and Sandy says, ""I dont know where you're going honey, but we're going to Purserville."" 
So we went to Purserville and saw FlickerFlame, and some other really cool bands that I'm too tired to talk about right now. It was at a roller rink... much much cooler than Berryville... and there were about 50 more kids than there are at Berryville. I was also in a much livelier mood than I was at last nights show...so in all, it was a pretty awesome night.

I look back on last year and see how much I wasnt apart of anything. We never hung out. Hardly even in school. And now we hang out alot more... 
Maybe its because now Jamie has Daryl. And hes, well, very clingy. And Ash and I dont exactly like him. And maybe it was because last year I had Brendan... and all the times I was allowed to do anything, I spent with him... It made them closer... and now that Jamie hangs out with Daryl Ash and I are closer. Anyway, I hope this year doesnt turn out like last year. 

Anyway, I worked with Cassandra at 12 today. It wasnt that bad. Then Mema picked me up while mom and Sarah had a Heritage Society meeting. I watched Sex and the Single Mom on Lifetime... my god... *shivers*

I told mom to make chicken and dumplings and shes making them with noodles. You dont make chicken and dumplings with noodles. You make them with dumplings... 

I miss Dylan WEBER. I finally remember his last name. He NEEDS to get online.

On the way back it got dark and Dixie kept trying to trip me.  Then we got back to my house and called a whole bunch of people. Jamie was at Daryls and he kept getting mad at us.
Jamie called at 9 and came over to spend the night. We watched Degrassi: The intense moments until like 3 when we all feel asleep on the couch. At 5, everyone came downstairs because Bridget was leaving so we went to my room and All slept on my bed. It was awful. We got up at 9 this morning. jeez. 

Anyway, today I have to work at 5. Which means I cant go to the f-ball game. Or to Tovah's party. I feel pretty bad.

Today, after school, I had to go to the mill to train stupid Whitney Miller and then I was leaving to go out with Ashleigh and Jamie. So I had a really really bad headache, and stupid Whitney Miller calls in and says her mom went out of town and she couldnt work. Yeh, like I'm buying that. So I dont think Sarah is going to hire her now. 
I stayed until 7:30 and Sarah let me leave. Jamie, Ashleigh and I were going to see Dickie Robinson but ended up just going shopping. I bought an outfit, a belt, and a Further Seems Forever Cd. I'm not sure which one. I just wanted to buy an album of theirs because I didnt have one and I'm musically deprived right now because most of the stuff I listened to was Bridgets....Although I think she has some of mine... I know she has my mixes. 
I spent another hundred. I've been doing that weekly yet I still have nothing to wear. I need some freakin shoes.

I have it with Jillian, and we had to pick one of those encouraging posters on the walls to write a 1 page essay on. I had, ""Just because something is difficult doesnt mean you should give up, it just means you should try harder.""  Mom ended up writing it for me.  English 9 Honors with all last years English class. It was really boring and Coach B. Hall looks like the rabbit off Winnie the Pooh... Last is Earth Science with Smoot... and oh god... He is SO dumb. He goes from talking about science and how was ""no good at it"" to football-the love of his life, to talking about beating his kids. We havent gotten to that one yet though. I have that class with Kaylee, Ash, Tovah, Wes, Andy, David, and Justin,- All of which failed it last year. We'll see how that goes. 
Lunch... was good. We have Seminar for the first 3 weeks, but then we'll have an hour lunch. 
Its SO different than Middle School... We get 5 minutes in between classes, and we basically just walk around. The teachers in Middle School got mad at if we were even talking in the halls.

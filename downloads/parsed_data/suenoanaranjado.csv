I have crossed the line
Now you won't be mine
Anymore.

One more dream
Vanished up in smoke
Now I have no hope
Anymore.

Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much 
To the world

One more loss
In a losing life
Doesn't hurt so bad
Anymore.

Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

And there's nothing there for you to prove

Oh, look what you've done
You've made a fool of everyone
Oh well, it seems likes such fun
Until you lose what you had won

Give me back my point of view
'Cause I just can't think for you
I can hardly hear you say
What should I do, well you choose

"event","Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday


I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow


We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
We head back to hell again
We kiss and we make up on the way


I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
But as our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow


Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, 
maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
You never know baby youuuu and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow"

Like I don't have a partner 
Sometimes I feel

Is the city I live in 
The city of angels 
Lonely as I am 
Together we cry 

I drive on her streets 
Cause she's my companion 
I walk though her hills 
Cause she knows who I am 
She sees my good deeds 
And she kises me windy 
I never worry 
Now that is a lie 
 
I don't ever want to feel 
Like I did that day 
Take to the place I love 
Take me all the way 

It's hard to believe 
That there's nobody out there 
It's hard to believe 
That I'm all alone 
At least I have her love

"event","well it final happened. i knew i was gonna blow and i did. i fuckin blew a fuse. just too many things have been happening to me too many people think they can push me around. jim just fuckin was the unlucky person that i blew up on. i mean he didnt really do that much and yea i definetly over reacted but its one of those things where you poke me, and just keep poking me until i slam you in the face. (ryan knows what im talking about) it felt good but at the same time now i know i have to go make an awkward apology. oh well ill take it. it was worth it. at least i was able to stop when i did. i dont think i really hurt him but i was definetly going down that path. its weird i really couldnt control what i did. he slapped me in the face much harder then he intended. i know he didnt mean to hit me that hard but at that point it didnt matter something in me just snapped and i was blinded with anger. I guess thats something thats wrong with me.  I should address things before they get out of control. This incident would never have happened if I had just stopped people from taking advantage of me from the beginning. Instead i hold it all in until at one point i explode. that cant be healthy. In the end im glad i have wrestler instincts rather than fighting instincts cause wrestling someone is better than starting to throw punches. all i can say is i predicted this coming, so it came. I apologize to everyone who has to put up with me over reacting but at the same time i hope the people who walk all over me feel like shit. well i feel better now regardless. peace for now."

"event","this weekends: started out with me and gerard goin to play soccer, and when we got there some of the varsity players were also playing which was sweet because they asked us to play a small sided game with them. they were so sick but gerard and i still scored a goal each. i got back to gray and kerry invited me to chill in her room so jim and i went over and chilled for awhile. i talked to emma she was mad sick and told her not to go skiing(cause im such a great dad). then we all decided to go to a lodge party, but jim and i couldnt get in which sucked ass but its all good. sat i woke up at 2 30 tried to call Will but he wasnt there. its actually kinda funny cause i asked him his number and he gave me the wrong fuckin one at first. haha oh will.  i miss the kid but he said hes comin to spend two weeks with me in may which will kick ass. anyway i called emma who hadnt gone skiing, and then went to play soccer with gerard again, but sadly the varisty team wasnt there this time. after that me and jim headed out to the grape leaf, a mediterranian restaurant(really lebanese) since jim is lebanese, and it was fuckin delicious, only problem was we had to walk all the fuckin way there which is about 3 miles, and ended up being 4 miles cause i took us the longest way possible. but in the end  it was worth it... mmmmm kafta. anyway we got back and headed out to the fiji lodge party which i have to go to cause two of my 3 closest friends, (Max and Dany) are part of the frat. it was alright there but we went to a different lodge (which i snuck into cause i wasnt on the list) and it was crazy in there. the night kinda went downhill from there, jim who i spend a lot of time with now cause dany and max are fuckin ridiculously busy at the frat got real drunk and depressed that he didnt have  a girlfriend and i had to take him back to gray. thi was actually a more difficult task than you might think considering it was freezing rain outside and we basically had to iceskate on our shoes all the way back. being drunk never helps this and i must admit it was hard even being sober. somehow we returned safley and i just passed out right away which is probably bad since jim was so fucked up but hell im tired of being teh sober caretaker. i awoke at 1 30 on sunday to see that i had an email about our core group meeting for 1 30. sadly i didnt get there till 2 30 and they were already finished. hahaha makes up for the other group i was in where i did all the fuckin work. well kerry is in my group and we just chilled in the library talked and studied it was a chill afternoon. finally i realized i hadnt eaten all day and after a  hardy meal decided i had nothing better to do than watch sports center and write in live journal. wow this entry was way to long"

"event","well im chillin at home emma came for the weekend and it was mad fun... except for the little ""run in"" with my dad. oh well shit happens i guess. it was still a great time, we stayed up so late and had a great talk and of course i made her all tired for the next day. we went to philly and it was so cold, but it was fun i got a beckham poster for sunita which im sure shell enjoy. im glad to know that theres still a great connection between emma and i, and i know  if we didnt have to sleep we could talk forever. its so fun being with her again after missing her so much. i cant wait till she gets back from break and we can chill again, but after that im not sure when ill see her again, as i dont have a car or an any breaks for awhile. it makes me sad but for now ill tell myself to live in the moment and enjoy it to its fullest. like always.
siempre mi corazon late por ti"

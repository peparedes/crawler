(21:43:19) Dan: tell yours first?
(21:43:48) Francy: I think it had something to do with Island and a zoo
(21:43:50) Francy: and an elephant
(21:44:36) Dan: 8DDDD
(21:44:38) Dan: MINE
(21:44:40) Dan: IS FUCKED CRAZY
(21:44:46) Francy: what happened? :O
(21:44:51) Dan: I was this redhaired girl with a ball and chain
(21:44:58) Dan: and I was living with Haine Naoto and Bisho[
(21:45:00) Dan: *p
(21:45:13) Dan: ...and we were fighting a thousand Magatos and Freulings
(21:45:18) Dan: ...so hard that we lost
(21:45:31) Dan: then we started to runa way and my shoes kept coming off and Haine ahd to pick them up
(21:45:40) Dan: and then we got in a cab that went so damn slow
(21:46:00) Dan: so we asked the driver to front-end the bad guys' car
(21:46:02) Dan: and then we ran
(21:46:13) Dan: and then we crossed a bridge and went into the sewers
(21:46:28) Dan: and surfaced into the living room of haine's mom
(21:46:37) Dan: ...who looks like a local actress, only blonde
(21:46:52) Dan: and then we went upstairs to share lunch with haine's family, but freuling caught up with us
(21:46:56) Dan: so we had to go again
(21:47:09) Dan: so we crossed another bridge, disguised as students
(21:47:23) Dan: and crossed this massive tarmac and crawled around in a football field
(21:47:33) Dan: only there was a volleyball coach nearby chucking bottles at us
(21:47:37) Dan: so we had to duck
(21:47:44) Dan: we craaaaawled for miles
(21:47:47) Dan: then crossed a road
(21:47:52) Dan: which led us to a cliff
(21:47:57) Dan: which was covered in snow.
(21:48:15) Dan: we slept int his cold cave, where we ended up putting make up
(21:48:19) Dan: on Haine's face
(21:48:22) Dan: ...then I woke up.
(21:48:44) Francy: ... XDDDD
(21:48:47) Dan: ...shush.
(21:49:01) Dan: it's an awesome dream
(21:49:19) Francy: haha it was better than mine

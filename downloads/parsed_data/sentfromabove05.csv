"event","Ughhh I feel terrible, my throad and nose and HEAD!!!!! I can't stop caughing or blowing my nose. And tomorrow I have to go to school so that I can go to the EC and finish my phelpstival story and start a new one. And I have to do my voice over, and my throat is just feeling terrible. I'm going to take tea to school and when i go to the EC im going to drink coffee. The pressure is on for college apps and all that other shit. I cant even fill out apps b/c I dont have my SAT scores. I didn't even take A SAT. So I'm going to try and do my essays and I'm going to ask Mr.Hain and Ms. Gundlach to write me reccomendations. And I'm probably going to ask Cindy too. My 5 colleges are down- the ones I'm applying to. They are Edinboro, NMU, La Salle, Ithaca, and Marist. 2 are in NY 2 are in PA and 1 is in Michigan. I really want to get like a short Halle Berry haircut but my dad wont let me b/c he says I will look ugly, and that people pay to have my hair and that my head is too big anyway. Oh well, hmm- what else is new. I'm still dieting!!!! I don't even have the urge to cheat when i'm feeling down or sad, stressed, or frustrated. And I used to go straight to food to help me. Now I'm just like there is not point, I'll regret it afterwards anyway and that regret is just going to add to my stress. I just need to start exercising and if my plan goes the way I want it to, I will start to go to a gym if/when I get my license at the end of this month. So that this way I have no excuse not to go, I can just drive myself there. And next month I'll probably start applying to jobs and things like that. But right now i should be doing some research for the AIDs/HIV awareness club. Finding some organizions we can go and help out and things like that. So I'm going to do that this weekend. In addition to my college essay, regular HW, and trying to read most of this Virginia Woolf book so that I can start on Beowolf. The pressure is already starting to come on. But I think i can handle it, I believe I have gotten stronger as the years have gone by and there are times I just wish I could drop dead, not like suicide, but just die from exhaustion, but int he end it always works out. My main goals now are to loose weight, do well in my internship and school, finish all my college shit and hopefully ( with God's help) get a scholarship. If I can do all of this and in the meantimme keep a job, help the HIV club, and my bro. I will have sucessfully juggeled a shit load of work. I think I can do it, I just hope God will help me through. The rest is up to me. Okay well I'm going to go take some more medicine, and READ!! Ciao"

"event","Well, it has been a very long and stressful week. I slept as if i were a bear going into hybernation yesterday. my intersnhip is going well , and my taping went bad. lol. I kept on messing up, but when i saw the end result my performance was nice especially compared to my co-anchor, who didn't have to do as many re-dos as I did. the only problem was that my hair was poofy and i looked fat, but my face looked cute, lol. so next time i will NOT straighten my hair when it is raining and i wil NOT wear that black top on camera. I will also read SLOWLY to prevent stumbling. My first story is the Phelpstival, which is today. Um also today is the 3rd? anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks and Ethiopian New Year. I took a practice ACT at Sylvan and got a 23.25, and last time I got a 22. So I'm thinking I should just focus on my SATs, i think those will really help me get a scholarship. Even though my ACT score is above average- most colleges want like a 27 for a scholarship where as for SATs you need like a 1275, and I  have a 1150, so i just need to get an extra 12-13 questions right or skip that many. Hmm what else, oh yea I have so many things to do! I need to write a draft proposal for a Dec. 1st concert for HIV/AIDs awareness with NO help from my club advisor. I also need to start researching essay topics colleges want and think about and begin to write. And I need to buy snacks for the first meeting and buy books for English. I just want this month to be over so I understand my schduel. Then I can contact the IOCC and see if I can do some volunteer work there and then find a weekend job. And around the 27th I'm going to take my driver's test. There is so much going on right now. It feels good and it also feels overwhelming. I'm also going to join a gym , it will help me gain energy and loose weight. Alrighty then I'm going to try and finish all the things on my list. Ciao"

"event","Well it's Labor Day weekend, and for some odd reason i've been wanting to studt lately. I think it has finally hit me that I'm a senior and I have to start applying to colleges soon , so that that means keep up grades and a good SAT score. Today I went to Sylvan ( like every saturday morning ) and guess what!?!?!?! I got a 1150!!!!! I improved 100 points from last week. My goal is to get a 1250, but i mean its only 50 points away from a 1300... so I'm really going to try and study. Look over some vocab and expecially math. Oh yea this monday I started taking this diet pill called Xenadrine, and I think it's really going to help me lose weight. I have been reading reviews of it and people have lost so much weight. The thing is that they also exercise, which I have NOT been doing. I think I should get my lazy, fat ass up and start doing that. Go back to my running thing. So the monday I started the date was August the 30th, so when I tell people how much I lost, i can tell them when I started dieting! Hmm what else has happened, I feel so overwhelmed with this whole college and SAT shit, I feel like i'll have a panic attack or heart attack everytime I thikn about it. what if i cant get a scholarship? I know i'll get accepted- i have great grades and w/e. But i'm really searching for a scholarship. the thing that sucks though is that Maryland has like no colleges with a broadcast journalism major. so this means i cant even visit the college i'll be attending b/c it's probably far. So I got an e-mail from Ms.Lorenze ( my EC advisor) and she said I'd be on camera on thursday , NOT Wednesday- which is when she told me, w/e. thats cool with me- i just have to tell people the date has changed. I'm such a freak, i already have my outfits picked for next week. you know what i have noticed about myself, i'm very forgetful. my sister told me to wake her up for work at 9 a.m. and I FORGOT!!!!!!! I feel and felt so bad. and now she is putting this guilt shit on me saying that she might get fired ( b/c this was her first day). i already feel enough guilt. UGHHHH! So besides completely negating the feeling of being smart today  I cut my bro's hair- AND it actually looks good. I got a new ringtone ( Where is the Love-BEP) and a wallpaper ( The Ethiopian and American Flag and my pic in the middle). And tomorrow there is a church picnic. I'm reserving Monday for a study/ homework day. I really want to do well, and with God's help, my family's support, and my determination- I know I can do it. Ciao!"

"event","Today was the first day of school..... I was excited like a dork for some reason. I think its just because for the first time, I'm really happy with the classes I'm taking. I'm ready to learn and absorb. The odd thing is that, all my teachers are men... hehe... not that I mind, it's just that I've never had that before.
First Period: AP English - Mr. Letsch ( Man )
Second Period: Forensics Honors- Mr. Filosa ( Man )
Third Period: Economics Honors- Mr.Goodman (Man)
Fourth Period: Trig/Algebra- Mr. Zeller ( Yummy Man )
Fifth Period: U.S. History honors- Mr. Bickerstaff ( Yummy Italian Man)
So you see, all these men are going to be in my face distracting me especially b/c 4/5 of my teachers are not married. I know its wronge, but I cannot help it. I like my men like my wine- mature, ripe, and imported!!!!! lol. I start my internship at the EC September 7th, NEXT WEEK! And I start on-camera September 8th, NEXT WEEK! I alreayd have my outfit planned out of course. Oh yea, I have started an SAT Prep course at Sylvan Learning Center- I have already improved my schore by 75 points. Im shooting for like a 1250- I'll be sure to get a scholarship with that at NMU!!! My dream college, although far I think it will be a great experience. OKay well responsibility beckons...Ciao"

Ive made several great close friends. Selam and Tseyone. they are ethiopian, which i have never had really close ethiopian friends ( besides my sister)and its reall cool. i mean me being ethiopian really consumes who i am, its a factor that affects a lot of aspects in my life, so it only makes sense that i clicked really fast with these two hoes.

Or<br>maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't<br>commit. In any case, you are faithless and<br>joyless. You find no happiness, love, or<br>acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most<br>days are a burden and you wonder when the<br>hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and<br>sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching<br>picture. You are the one that few understand.<br>Those that do know you are likely to love you<br>deeply and wish that they could do something to<br>ease your pain. You are constantly living in<br>memories of better times and a better world.<br>You are hard on yourself and self-critical or<br>self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved,<br>you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite<br>your tainted nature, your soul is<br>breathtakingly beautiful.

"event","Wow, I never realized so much in the past few days how much I do and how unapreciated I am. I do so fucking much for this family and all I get is being scolded by the stupid bitch who gave birth to me. I not only have school work and problems of my own but I also have to take care of my brother's illness , watch him, and help him with his HW and make sure all his papers are signed and up to date. It doesn't help that he goes to a Catholic School, there is so much more to do! I have to make meals, fix my fathers bed , make appointments , tell people when to go food shopping. And to top it all off my sister and I are still not talking which means I have added work. No one ever helps me with my brother. For an example, yesterday morning, I fixed my father breakfast again and I also had to fix my brothers , make sure he had all his medicine supplies and his regular book bag in order. And I had to give him his medicine. Both my father and mother saw how stressed I was and instead of helping, my father sits there and says how great of a daughter I am and my mother watches me like the retard she is. I am stuck on the decision of whether or not I should run for class president. I want to and Im pretty sure I'll win but it will probably be more added stress since I'm going to intern, be president of the HIV/AIDs Awareness club and still deal w/ the shit I do now. It's so pathetic. I don't even know how I'm supposed to go to Ethiopia this summer with that woman who gave birth to me. If I cant get along with her here , then how am I supposed to in a completely different country.I'm seriously thinking of getting into another big fight with her so that we can ignore eachother again. At least then I would have less stress. OMG! I just remembered, I have been asking people to take my bro and I to the library so that I can get him a fairytale book for his project due tomorrow. And no one takes us. It turned out find b/c I got a book from the internet to print out. But it was so stressful b/c he is getting a cold and he wasn't focusing and following directions so the project took so much longer then it should have. I don't know what I am going to do with my life. Suicide is so over-rated. I just want to run away. Get the fuck out of this place. I'm going crazy!! Tomorrow is Friday... I need to do some mega shopping. I need pens,pencils, make an appointment to get a new eye prescription, mascara, batteries, crayons , paper , socks , and shit load of other things I can't remember right now. I cheated today, which is no surprise since I'm addicted to food. And it is a way that I releave stress and get some comfort. I excercised, but not as much as I wanted too. I am getting terrible back pains. I completely failed a Chem test I took today. God willing , my life will change for the better soon. I just need to go to church...Ciao... I'll leave you with something inspirational by Gary Zukav

"event","So if I didn't already say it, i had Friday off and today off from school. I did absolutly nothing! I worked out , watched tv, and slept. Even though I've been exercising , I still feel lazy - especially with school work. Im gonna clean out my second binder and then just have one big binder. I've been itching all over for some reason. :/ I finally did my eyebrows! But right now I'm wearing NO makeup and i feel ugly :(.Hmm, Bete came over for Mimi and with a guy, I forget his name. And I was trying to hide b/c I look like shit. Okay so today I have kept up with the diet. I need to wash my whites and while i'm in the basment I'm gonna do my workout. Last night I was trying to watch 'Single in Las Vegas' but ever since I made up with my mother she has been following me everywhere! After seeing that it was going to come back on again at 1:00 i was like fine, ill wait for it b/c it was a really good episode. But right when it was going to be 8 mins till , the fucking screan comes up saying "" Searching for Satelite Signal."" I'm like WTF!!!!!!!!! I hate Direct TV. Last night I watched a program on cleavage and it was called that. It was interesting but it had me thining about my boobs. I WANT A BOOB JOB! lol not inhancement but maybe a lift? So they can be perky, lol :P. Anyway this boy Johnathan and his little online crew of friends won't leave me the fuck alone. Its like he hasnt even met me and he tells me that he loves me. LOSSSEERRR! hmm... what else? My mouth feels funky , oh yea my sis and I are in a fight. On Saturday there was a b-day party for my bro, Mekael's friend- Girum. And I wanted to take a shower so she was like okay you take one and Mekael and I will go and get the gift. And they came back but i wasnt ready. I was getting frustrated and was like I'm not gonna go. Blah blah blah , yelling and w/e. So we aren't talking anymore. I had to give Mekael his insuling and she is supposed to do mornings. So she better do it tonight. Just b/c I don't have school doesnt mean anything. What else... ughh school tomorrow. I've come to the realization that I really don't like going to school. I completely dread it. But im getting out in 05'!!!!! I need to set up and appointment with my counsler, I will have to remember to do that tomorrow. Oh yea report cards. OMFG!!! I got an 'A' for Chem, how crazy is that? I think I'm gonna get an 'A' this quarter for math. So the only class i really have to worry about is SPanish. Then I can get straight 'A's' yay. Oh yea but English I have this big big big Research Project. I didn't even finish reading the book yet and this friday 10 note cards on 7 book and 3 online sources are due. I can finish the book , no prob. I can get 3 online sources, but 7 BOOKS! ughh. I'm going to have to go to the library this week anyway for Mekael b/c he has a project due too.Well my nails are done, so are my brows. I jsut need a nice quick shower. I want to straighten my hair but I'm too lazy. I'll do it this weekend. Okay well, I guess Ill go . Ciao!"

"event","So I've been exercising a lot lately,my ass is on FIRE!The whole day at school my ass has been hurting. But!!! I have been cheating on my diet. It's soooo hard. But I'm eating less and less carbs each day. I heard something about Dr. Atkins and the reason for his death , I dunno i gotta research it. They are probably trying to say the Atkins diet is not healthy. WHICH, it is! I started the diet, off and on before a lot of people knew about it. About 5 years ago, in the 6th grade. And I have seen nothing but great results. Weight loss, growth of nails and hair, and feeling good generally. Anyway, my sister and I had a talk. And at school now they are on their psychiatric unit. And has been going to Sheppard Pratt. SO, we were talking and she saw how the patients were. Getting to the point, tomorrow I'm going to talk to my mother for the first time in a long ass time. She is like mentally sick, lol. As terrible or funny as it may sound, but my sister said that if I dont talk to her she is going to get worse. Especially considering I'm her favorite.So things are going good. My excersicing, my relationships with people. I have gained some and strengthened some. And finally I am happy with all the people I am surrounded by. T-bone and I had a toxic relationship and it just wasn't working. I don't think I ever want to talk to her again, or see her. It makes me sick. And its bothering me that Matt wants to meet up, b/c I dont. And I dont want to make up excuses. Because they are getting old. And I dont want to tell him the truth b/c I dont want to hurt his feelings. I'm like stuck on this. I DUNNO WHAT TO DO! Yea well its getting late. NO SCHOOL FRIDAY OR MONDAY!! I need to work on English work. One more day until my nice little weekend. Ciao! Oh yea there is this quote by Gary Zukav (an amazing self help guru/ spiritualist):

"event","I took a little nap from 4:45-7:00, hopefully I will be able to go back to sleep. Just got done my bro's dinner and medicine. And I have NO HOMEWORK! I think I'm going to make an additional website on my main one, so check for that. Um... nothing new really. Oh yea, no school on Friday and on Monday. So I think I'll invite Koni and Selam to see ""Barbershop"" and maybe Meron too. I want to see it but my sis doesn't , I wanted to go out with friends anyway. So maybe we will do that and go to Owings Mills Mall too or Security. But I gotta get Jen (Robinson) a gift. I'm gonna go to Blockbuster and get her a gift card there cuz I bought a Blockbuster game , she always goes to movies so I'm sure she would win. So I will have 10 bucks to my name after her gift but I'll just ask my dad for a 20 when we go out.So now after this I won't have any gifts to buy for anyone until May 12th (my sis). I want to ger her a really REALLY BIG gift this year. I just have no idea what to get her. Maybe concert tickets to something.. I dunnno. It would be coming out of my Dad's wallet anyway :P. SO next year being my last in high school is slowly becoming a reality. It's wierd. Like I adjusted myself to have next year be my junior year. And people are starting to make me feel sad that I won't see them any longer. But I might make some special appearances. It's all good, it's all for my future.Which I'm investing a lot into so it will turn out great in the end. Oh yea I need to make an appointment with my counsler to talk about internship, hopefully I can intern at a news station or something. If not my dad has connection to NPR.Okay well yeaaaa... I guess I'll start on that page. Ciao!"

"event","So I haven't done an entry in a while. OKay well updates. My aunt is in Ethiopia now, I already miss her and I wish I went with her, I know I would have a great time. She is staying in Addis Abeba-the capital. Umm so the whole diet thing Im gonna restart tomorrow, lol. I don't feel like explaining myself but yea, I need to restart tomorrow. So today was church. I couldn't go in the actual sanctuary b/c I have my period, so I had to chill in the dining hall and get bothered but a bunch of yucky kids. They wouldn't stop asking me questions. SO after all this one of my friends comes down and tells me that my friends are in the bathroom, and I'm like I doubt it. Then whole and behold, their asses are in there and chillen, I was mad! And then my friend Meron was supposed to come today but out of the blue comes a test, BULL! lol... the same thing happened to my little bro. His friend Girum didn't show up cuz his parents were tired. But I got a bunch of compliments, AS USUAL! lol.umm... what else? Valentimes is coming,which means chocolates and I will be strong. UNlike today where I had 2 fastbreaks and a recess pieces. I don't know why but I have Michael Jackson stuck in my head and its really bothering me! Okay well I think Ima go watch the grammys. CIAO!"

"event","Okay, we got a lot of catching up to do. Saturday I went shopping and bought my cousin Koni a gift then afterwards my bro, sister, and I went to our aunt's house to mourn with her. Sunday morning I was planning on waking up early to straighten my hair then go to church. But, nooooo. My immune system decides to shut down. So I was left with a cold. And so i stayed home all day sunday. Sunday night I was contemplating whether or not to go to school on monday. B/c monday ( today) is my cousin's bday and i was going to do her makeup and have her gift and balloon. But then I was like h/o, what was my new year's resolution? It was to be more selfish and stop worrying about others. So I decided I was going to go to school for like the first couple of periods, that way I could still do her makeup and give her , her gift. BUt when I woke up, all hell broke loose, and it just wasn't going to happen. So today I just layed in my parents bed, watching tv and sleeping. I cought up with 'Passions' but I missed Oprah, but thats okay.Ummm.... oh yea major drama I missed at church yesterday, the priest's daughter was telling lies to people about how this deacon, who I like along with a cousin of mine- lol, was talking about us. But in reality she was making it all up! Now for people who aren't aquinted with the Orthodox Church, the clergy is allowed to marry and the deacon is like 20- so no I'm not a freak.  But from what I've heard this isnt her first time. And she said things about all of the people in our clique- which basically includes all the girls who attend out church.Anyway, I'm gonna finish this bowl of cereal and do my Spanish HW, UGHHH! Oh yea, hopefully this will be my last bowl, b/c I'm starting my diet tomorrow ( ATKINS!!!- I love him)Hopefully I can stay on it :/"

And the stupid bitch just had to give him a project to do! And to top it all off , while in my parent's room trying to help my bro with his project, that bitch whom I will never call mom, decides that 'Wheel of Fortune' is more important than her son b/c while trying to tell my bro to turn off the tv so he can concentrate, she gets all upset and yells at him. Even after he had tripped and hurt his foot, she scolded him for not wearing socks instead of comforting him. Im so stressed, my father expects no B's , bullshit! Sorry daddy, but I'm so stressed trying to take care of YOUR son and dealing with YOUR wife that I can't even focus on my own fucking self. Bullshit... no b's......... Oh yea but on a lighter hand, it is Oprah's b-day today. Lol, i love her, she is like my aunt! Happy B-Day OPRAH!!!"

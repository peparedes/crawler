Reallly bad.
I love getting paid for doing nothing.

Yesterday I hung out with Tom woo!

...and it was so hard seeing you. 
blah.

Today is mother's day, and I don't have a mother.
Just a memory.
The closest thing to a mother I have is Kayla's mom, my aunt jo, and Nana.
I love them all very much, but they aren't my own. They have kids of their own.They are always there when I need them, and I thank them for that. I hope they know, because they are all wonderful people. But I miss my mom. There's no other realtionship quite like a mother and her child, and I only got to experience that for 13 years, I guess i'm lucky cause some people never get to. I love you mom and I forgive you for all the things you've done. Happy Mother's Day, i will visit you today. Kayla I want you to come with me. 

Anyway, work is soon, thank god i don't have to work ALL day just 10-3, bummer."

"event","So, I don't write in my lj too much anymore, but i'm having so many thoughts run through my head, especially since my bad day yesterday. I'm not even exactly sure why it was bad, I didn't do anything and nothing happened, but I thought about a lot of stuff. I'm not sad nor happy, but for some reason life seems kind of worthless right now. It's sad when you're desperatly looking forward to going away for a few days to a different state just to get away from your life. I dont even get why this is all coming into my mind now because really nothing bad is going on, i dont know. Christmas isn't so jolly right now, and believe me I wish it was because I look forward to Christmas as being a time to be with your friends and family and really feeling like you're a part of something special. I dont feel like I am anything special. I'm just kind of stuck in this boring rutt that's called my life. I'm looking forward to a few things in 2005 like being able to drive, and graduating high school and moving away from home. I'm just so bored with life right now, and I can't wait for something interesting to happen. I wish time could skip to July so I can be 18 and not in Stuart anymore. I'm hoping that my last 7 months here will be fun and I can feel like a belong, and I have happy memories to leave to, and maybe even for people to be sad when I leave. Things change, people change, life changes, and I do love change, but I wish some things would stay the same. It's too much to ask for people to stay the same, friendships change either for the worse or for the better. I feel so close to some of my friends right now, and some I feel like i'm pretending to have this great friendship with, when I know it's really not like that anymore, cause ya know...people change. It just happens that way. I'm not sure why. To keep us on our toes I guess. I wish I didn't have to pretend anymore, and that we're really that great, but I'm not too sure that that's true, that if I stop pretending things will just drift away. Maybe I'll be proven wrong. hopefully. 

so yeah me rambling isn't fun. ok bye."

"event","I had SUCH a good day today. 

It was tacky mismatch day in school today, and i rocked it.

I finally got to do what i've wanted to do since the beginning of the year. yes =)

I went to the parade and walked with the seniors , thats was interesting. 

Then went and hung out with emily, hillary, and ralph. and ate at duffy's. 

I dunno I just had a good day, which usually never happens, maybe it'll become a trend.

The only thing bad about tonight is that my fishy died =("

"event","Update necessary.

I've been kinda upset lately. I feel very unwanted, unwelcome, whatever.
I have a stock project due tomorrow, and it's really annoying cause i don't know how to put it together.
I also have senior pictures tomorrow, i have no idea what i'm going to wear for my 3 outfits. no idea. 
gah i'm stressed.

I'm really bad at getting guys, there are people i want to talk to, but some reason i just have this block, it's so friggin annoying. I try to put the vibe out, but no doesnt work.

Now sweet tea.... hehe I like it. But yes for the update: finally got settled in the new place and got my comp up and running with dsl. My birthday is apparently in 23 hours, and three minutes as of me writing this sentence..... and its my two month anniversary with Emily woot.... Kinda crazy we've been together this long already yet we see each other every day for the past five months practically. Strange I'm so happy... its intoxicating. Normally I'd have gotten bored with her by now but I just can't seem to see her enough its weird... I suppose I should put this as private but alas I'm lazy and tired. SO its there for everyone. G'night all am off to dream land.

"event","Well as the title states I had some horrible sleep deprivation and rode some rollercoasters! Heh as known by my previous posts have been hanging out with some friends lately and having good times. Well here's the story really... woke up at 2pm just kinda ready to hang and chill out on a friday mornin with some friends and ended up being me, Emily, Joel, Ame, Morgane, Tabitha and Kim. (the last two I dunno) But anyways after sitting around talking for awhile we ended up deciding to hit downtown g-ville and apparently there was the greek festival going on unknown to me. So we wandered around there a lil bit then stopped at the marble slab and got some ice cream. After that we apparently decided to go hang out at the reedy(sp) river, its nice there quiet grassy banks and warm sun. But anyways so Joel, Emily and Morgane go walking in the river whilst me and Ame are sitting on the bank chatting and Tabitha and Kim kinda went and did their own thing (they weren't really part of the group)but yeah all of a sudden Joel turns around wraps his foot up in his shirt and tells me we gotta go to the hospital. Apparently it turns out that he cut himself (dunno on what) but even managed to sever a small artery in his foot. woot for him. But yeah after running a mile or so back to the car in 90 degree or so weather I turned on my four-ways and did about 90 all the way to greer in about 10 minutes. Yay for me. But after all that jazz and waiting around in the ER for somewhere around 4 hours I believe finally got to leave and head home only to go to work and be an hour late. Other than that while in the ER Me, Emily, Ame and Morgane were all sitting around talking and the subject got around to how Emily was going to Carowinds with her friends who had free tickets and she invited me to come. So I did. Heh so now it's 8 am I was getting home still no sleep... called her got directions to where she was and went and picked her up and went to Carowinds. Good times there other than the fact I had a stomachache for awhile which sucked and the no sleep. Definitely gonna have to go again sometime. But I didn't get to ride the new rollercoaster sadly the assimilator. Lays you down and corkscrews and stuff apparently everyone said it gave them kinda a headache. But oh well. Thanks for the good times Emily. And now for the story of my ride home. Have you ever seen one of those pirate maps to treasure in some old cartoons of it being goofy of loopy lines and such and lots of backtracking? Yeah that'd be how I got home. By about this time I'm running on 30 hours or so no sleep singing at the top of my lungs with all the windows down in the rain to keep myself awake. I ended up going from here to Charlotte (which was correct since em is a good navigator) but on the way back I somehow got lost and ended up in Columbia (yay for me) and drove around it once and then drove up going towards Chester and got lost there too but I finally made it home all safe and sound. And promptly passed out. That's been my wild weekend and I'll have to say even though it was long and odd I had a great time."

"event","Good times rock. Went to a party with some friends last night and it was good matter of fact even worked had no sleep after having a horrible shitty night/early morning that day and then had to work that afternoon and got to the party and was instantly better. So lemme add this up.... woke up at 4pm and did nothing until midnight to 8 am...(working) 9 am to 2pm (sleeping then), 210pm until ..... 830 am.... 845am to noon...(sleeping) and then since I woke up it is currently 2 am and I'm wired.... I don't really have the patience or mental effort or ability to total up the sleep so I'm not going to bother. It was good times though and I wish everyone was having as fun much as I just did it was the vacation I needed. I hope you get yours soon too lore! And krista sorry about mike being not the person he was I bet that's hard, if you need me I'm always here. Other than that I went and saw a good movie today at the new movie theatre over by westgate mall, was quite a nice theatre I must say almost just like Cherrydale. But yeah back to the movie, it was Eternal Sunshine for the spotless mind (I do believe thats correct) and it was a love story. Normally I don't go to theatres and watch these I wait until they're on tv so I can watch them in private like the big softie people claim I am heh. But yeah I'm quite glad I listened to my friends who reccommended the movie and glad I saw it. I was quite pleased. Other than that I saw the sunrise while not being at work for the first time in awhile quite another pleasant surprise. And even chilled in downtown for a bit just chatting while overlooking the city at night from one of the oddest stand points ontop of a parking garage. But yep all in all it was a great evening. Thanks guys."

But I miss everyone and I can't wait till later in the summer, will be good to see everyone again, and to those I won't get to see remember that I still love ya.

And when our eyes meet, in the passion of lost moments, I feel my soul flare and hear words of undecipherable lust and love. A language merely for us. A language not really based on words or definitions but just strange barely audible noises that even were they whispered into my ear my angel sounds so far far away. When we hold each other and we're cradled into each other's essence I can feel our hearts entwine and become one, I feel my heartbeat quicken, my blood race and can feel the divine
emotion of my birth of being something new, someone new. To be loved and be loved in return more deeply any anyone has ever felt and known, a mystical bond that only her and I share. When will I ever find someone who can consume me like that?

Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply, so absurd
In these times of doing what you're told
You keep these feelings, no one knows
What ever happened to the young man's heart
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
Swimming through the ashes of another life
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Send a message to the unborn child
Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else 
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

What ever happened to the young man's heart
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
Swimming through the ashes of another life

Staring down the barrel of a 45

Always condemning me
And nobody knows what I believe

"event","Yay for carshopping although I do believe I have only one sales person to wait till he gets off work then lynch him. (not really but I thought about it after he was a complete ass to me and my buddies.) So for the story it was me, Kevin, and Lance (lance is basically my adopted brother in law as for the fact he's dating my adopted sister or getting married to her in april or yeah its a long long complicated story -don't ask) and Kevin well is lance's best friend not to mention one of our co-workers since we all work at the same place. So yeah basically we just looked around and such and drove around on the motor mile all night but I stopped at one place which is where lance bought his 2001 'stang and referred me to the guy he bought it from. Alright well the truck I found there 2002 nissan frontier crew cab midnight black running boards, chrome wheels, 6 disc cd changer, s-roof just all in all a lot of goodies, now it isn't four wheel drive or supercharged like I wanted but he's cutting me a great deal after I haggled with him. Truck has 8-thousand miles on it thats all. He dropped it down from 22-23 thousand to 12 grand basically after we talked about trade ins and such thats assuming my credit is good (should be my cell phone was pretty cheap on the security deposit) but yeah other than that went to another dealership and checked out a 2004 4x4 supercharged frontier and the guy got serious cool points, he didn't let us test drive it until he took it off the lot but he didn't go below 90 mph half the time and was slinging the back end around turns and such so it was cool. After that and looking and trucks and all we went over to toyota dealership and checked out the toyota celica I wanted and this is the sales guy that was an asshole. I asked him if I could test drive and he just plain flat out said no. So yeah but then I hung out with antonio later that night and he pointed out the truck he was gonna buy that new 2004 chevvy truck thats like only two seats a convertible and looks like the 1920s truck I can't remember what its called but yeah its sweet. And I also got a look at the new dodge viper and the new dodge ram 1500 r/t (22.5 inch tires, I work on 18 wheelers and those are the tires they use! also it has a viper engine in it! only 50k$) so yeah that was my night in a nut shell and all umm and lore if ya read this gimme a call sometime to make sure my phone is still working would love to hear about your trip. And brian if ya ever bother to read this gimme a call mid febuary or so Maybe I'll come down and we can get a game of necromunda going.

Figured I could get some store credit back at least for claiming it didn't work on my comp, alas but no. They said they could only give me another copy of it so I took another one but still browsed around to check out goodies I might have to splurge for and voila! Whilst browsin through the anime section I stumbled upon an old dvd, my favorite anime series! Casshan: Robot Hunter, So I paid the 25$ for it and woot! Therefor whenever I see you gaming friends of mine again will have to make you sit down and watch it, especially you sirch, you and your endless hours upon hours of anime. Other than that might be getting switched to a desk job at work I've just found out, kinda a lil pay raise in this but not really much.

Also note to self gotta go to dmv and shit and bank and yeah a lotta crap since my wallet has vanished. Just up and gone with about 100$ in it, how lovely huh? been a coupla days actually since my total lack of actual effort into the subject is limited by work and well my incredible lack of strength. Anyway though yeah glad I get paid tomorrow. But back to the doc thing. She had me fill out another appt form for next week so I will get another oppourtunity to tell her I think she's crazy. Also on another note, I might be getting a new car/truck within the next month or so. Debating on a nissan frontier (four door sporty truck) or the toyota celica(sporty two door car w/sunroof! woot!) So yeah also damn I need to find a girlfriend. Sure its nice to have to spend all my money on myself but damn I'm lonely. Anyone know any nice chicas around? heh can't blame me for askin.

So other than the arm in a sling I've gone to the doc and he said I should go to the company doc since the only way to fix the cuff is through surgery. SO yeah typing is a pain in the ass but I'm really worried about work I can't really take the pay cut of workmans comp or pay for the surgery so they better do all that and then I'm gonna be KO'd from work for awhile which is really gonna suck.

"event","What type of a person does it take to charge someone to sit there and watch something? To walk through a door for a piece of paper with some ink on it not even an inch by inch big? yeah its movie theatres and they keep jacking up their prices! It's an evil plot I tell you by our government yes big brother, to take our money and brainwash us I swear! If I just disappear within the next day or two you know I've stumbled onto something and have been silenced for it!.... okay anyway now on to
what really happened. Me and stripey went to see lotr: the return of the king and were trying to see the 445 showing that afternoon since well we kinda woke up at around noon and there really wasn't much of a way we were going to get to the 200
showings. Either way we got there at around 430 and my car wouldn't shut off, strange thing with the keys they won't turn all the way back to vertical so it leaves the cd player on and in turn kills my battery. .... yeah so after all that shit we got out at about 440 and went to the booth to buy tickets to where we find out that the 445 has been sold out for awhile. So we checked the other times and went and bought two tickets for the 7 10 showing..... so now with about 2-almost 3 hours to kill we sat at some lil hotdog place beside the theatre and ordered a bite to eat. The food was okay but the waitress was probably the best part of the meal lol. She must have asked me if I wanted a refill on my drink 7 times and didn't even ask stripey once. Either way though was pretty hard to not notice her flirting with me, but me being a big softie that I am didn't ask her for her #. (I'm an idiot yes I know). Anyways whilst we were trying to think of things to kill time with we figured we see if james was home since he lived right down the road and see if he wanted to catch the movie with us. We picked him up and went back to the theatre and guess what? Me and stripey had the last two tickets to the 710 showing lol..... so I asked the lady politely if she could change my tickets over from 710 to the 915 showing and she did. Then james went to get his ticket and... me and stripey had just bought the last two tickets again. So the third time heh I ask the lady to switch them again and she flat out tells me no. What's up with that? pretty rude if ya ask me. But I scapled the tickets for the 915 to two guys walking by since the two college chicks had morning exams and couldn't stay out that late. So finally we go to buy some tickets AGAIN and its for the 1115 showing and voila! We finally got three. So after a long hard night and roughly 6-7 hours of sitting around a movie theatre we got to see the movie and it takes great talent to buy out a movie theatre showing twice! So yeah saw the movie it was pretty good I wasn't displeased at all. Oh and also bought a cell phone for anyone who cares in that time, you all should know the area code if you know me and the number is 906-1887.

"event","In other news:
Been pretty busy and haven't felt the need to be online much when I was in the house anyway since I was only really home for a short ammount of time. Went and saw the matrix revolutions (was pretty good I liked it anyways), bought an xbox and a couple of games, if you buy one I'd highly recommend kill-switch because well its just bad ass not to mention the commerical rocks! Other than that dead to rights (a platinum hit) and robotech battlecry because well transformers (I use the term lightly but pun was intended) rock too. Although the schedule change in work might also have something to do with the fact I haven't updated in awhile and yeah swing shift kinda blows when ya work 4-midnight then have to turn around and come back in at 8 am. yep. Also on other other news, for all  you fan folk of mine (not that any of you give a shit) the love life for me is still non-existant. Did figure out where all the hot chicks are at my work... they work first shift ain't that a bitch?
Not to mention most of them well I do believe are married or the simple fact have no interest in me at all. Must say though I guess its better this way, am kinda enjoying the single life again but still desire romance. But enough of the sappy stuff I guess I am off to go shoot more people or well do something that takes no effort in my part except to sit there and push buttons on a remote control or a gaming controller. adios.

What I'm talking about though is air soft match, guns look real shoot plastic bb's hurt like hell close up still hurt enough at 50 ft to leave a lil welt. Anyways though my navy buddy Chris came in at midnight last night to our surprise just earlier that day his package of air soft pistols had shown up.  Well
the guns hold 25 bbs per clip gotta cock after each shot.... well there are 4 of us and 7 guns so .... yeah I've got one clip heh. Sucks to be me. Well I'll show then I'll splurge a little and get me an uzi. (50 round clip fires 20 per second, that'll show em!) So yeah got about 2000 bb's left just for myself about 20,000 still at the house. Easily wasted 1000 today. So yeah.... I got a coupla licks one to my neck still itches since it was nearly point blank me and chris on opposite sides of a car stood up and wailed each other. So yeah all in all a coupla bruises scratches but almost was like playing matrix meets counter-strike without tactical shields or automatic weapons and martial arts. Heh I'm out to get some coffee!

(side note to others: I'm busy teasing a friend with twenty questions well since I decided to get her a christmas present early lol) As for the rest of the day had relatives come down from NY apparently this week and was invited to lunch with them before work today and it was great getting to see them again. Got the low down on my cousins Erik and Kristen. Erik is a carpenter and actually right now he's working on the house of the guy who owns 'Hummer' (yep thats right folks the car guy), now this guy is nuts. He's jewish so of course he built his OWN TEMPLE on his property. Also one bedroom in his house is 500,000 sq ft. *HEY-ZEUS!* thats bigger than where I live! Lots of cool stuff there. Kristen in the manager of some special place (the name eludes me right now its been a rough day at work and I've contracted one of the nastiest head colds possible!). So either way erik is happily married and my goddaughter is doing good (I think she's 10 maybe .... maybe 8, yes I know I'm horrible for saying that but well they live in NY ! kinda hard to pay the phone bills that far)and kristen is still dating the guy I met last time I was up there. He looks just like my friend cory its scary. But he's pretty cool. That and they got a cute pitbull hehe named Zeus very cool doggie. Hmm lets see oh yeah the pub rocked had good food. Other than that work was pretty long and with a runny nose it just kinda dragged on but I did get a lot of actual elbow work done. (cleaning and such) But yeah here's a quizzie and then I'm outta here for the night! Ciao!

1. Cory and Carrie had their baby apparently she's three weeks old (where the hell have I been?) her name is alexis brianna pruitt, I believe thats it.
2. Work sucks.
3. Work REALLY sucks.
4. Lance (adopted sis' hubby, aka bro in law) bought a new car. Damn shame he didn't ask me if I wanted his eclipse so he went and bought a 2001 mustang gt with 17k miles on it and a supercharger, midnight black with tinted windows and hot damn its fast.)
5. Note to self: rob a bank need money to fix my car up.
6. Note to self about note to self: first note to self is jokingly serious... (is that possible?)
7. Work INCREDIBLY SUCKS... especially when you don't really get days off anymore from working two jobs.
8. .... I'm tired.

And well thats all but lore said if I had asked before she baked she'd have mailed me some brownies.... She always makes me feel better!
Although to this I must go and meditate in front of my 'good' ""over-sized cd-player"" aka computer and listen to winamp and go to bed! adios amigos!

Feel free to ask me to send em to ya sirch I'm sure most of em you don't have. Also on that note I'll add  the best quote of the day that I've heard so far!
(my friend is a staffer for a shadowrun game online so well this is where it came from)
From afar, Lani tosses her line out one more time, ""I... I wuv you?""
You paged Lani with 'I know, dearie.'.
You paged Lani with 'In an unconditional, Brad is cool, I'll-love-him-even-if-he-doesn't-handle-my-initiation way. You better be offering sex if you want it done.'.
Lani pages: Goddamn. Umm... well, I don't think a handjob is necessarily cheating? j/k
Lani pages: What if I buy you a lapdance?

Just totally random topic apparently she wants something done and is cheating on him imagine that, the utter nerve of that girl lol. Either way quite funny in my opinion and since that pretty much came outta the blue I thought it was great. Anyways though I'm off to watch more anime and then sleep for must awake early to get lunch before work. Adios amigos.

<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Good</b> characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Thieves</b> are the most roguish of the classes. They are sneaky and nimble-fingered, and have skills with traps and locks. While not all use these skills for burglary, that is a common occupation of this class.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Solonor Thelandria</b> is the Chaotic Good elven god of archery and the hunt. He is also known as the Keen Eye, the Great Archer, and the Forest Hunter. His followers respect nature, and only hunt when needed, but are quick to defend the forest from intruders. Their favorite weapon is the bow, and they tend to be extremely talented with it. Solonor Thelandria's symbol is an arrow with green fletchings.

"event","If anyone wants to hear a good song not to mention a watch a funny video download this:
 Pokemon - Mindless Self Indulgence - Bitches.mpeg
heh a friend showed it to me last week and I tried to download it today but well as we all know, dial up sucks. Although random news on the homefront I guess, very funny when a friend tells you they had a crush on you but well they're dating someone else now and are happy. How funny is that? Two friends conversation between each other one pasted me and well its good for a laugh since I've been there a lot. Actually Shauna (to whom know me yes that shauna) said she had a crush on me since well... I think she said a couple of months after she met me until she broke up with joel and started dating the other guy. Anyways just random info I thought I'd post that since I'm bored and figured everyone else would like a little insight in my life (yes very egotistical I know but well what else would I have a journal for?)

"event","Well no real subject here except so far today is starting out to be shitty. Tried to call into work today but got a nice message of big boss is here you don't come in you're fired. So while still sorting through the crap of the weekend in my head and the emotional stress I get to go play with trucks and loud noises and machines and ....grrr either that or I'll just snap and the first person that says something to me is getting a 20 lb rachet upside the head. Either way yeah I'm having a bad week. For more info on the road trip I guess here's the rundown:
Well about 5 nights ago I get an IM from a random person of whom I know not. This said person I then ask where they got my IM from and they said a girl named laura. Now for side information Laura is a girl I know from my favorite hang out and haven't seen or spoken to her since about april. (yeah whenever spring break is.) Either way yeah good three weeks basically living with her we crammed a good 3 month relationship into that time slot. Well back to the story anyways I asked this so called friend of her's how she was doing and they said she'd been in the hospital a lot lately. I asked why. They said they thought she was pregnant. (how's that for a mind job all of a sudden??) Well back to the story, I decided to get more info and well the person said they'd call her and supposedly did. They got some more info on the 'father' and well whatdaya know I was a dead ringer for the description. So After they said that'd she wanted nothing to do with me I was hurt. I asked why and still couldn't get an answer so I figured hmm, called my friend brian and we were gonna go do something later that night and I asked him if he wanted to take a roadtrip. He said he had to visit a friend in NC anyway, so us being technically inclined hacked away on the net and got some addresses from carefully hidden places put gas in my car cranked the cd player to max and started on the road. I guess that also ties into the rest of the other post but at least that was all the background info I didn't really have time to put in too. So now it's really time for me to take a shower get ready for work and eat some breakfast and then go be in my bad mood don't fuck with me state until around 1 am. If you need to get a hold of me you know how, either that or sit and wait online to bitch at me for this story as I know possibly some of you will and ask, What the hell? So until then adieu.

"event","Well in a long story short I took a roadtrip this weekend with a friend of mine to get some very urgent business done. To whom I told the nature of this 'crisis' well apparently it was a fluke, conjured up by some random person of whom me and said person from the crisis have never known or heard of. So in brief summary I am now on a mission to figure out whom this person could be and why feed me a story like that? On the other hand I guess you could say I'm still battling my own demons on the situation. All in all from g-ville to asheville to chapel hill and back. approx. 400+ miles. heh good going for me huh? Anyways hopefully I'll talk to you folks soon I'm taking tomorrow off of work to recooperate and get my shit together(what a mind job I've had). To all whom I care about I miss you guys.

"event","Well I'm bored and was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on a good movie to see or so, am debating what to do on my day off since I just got paid. And thanks all that commented on my previous post made for some good laughs, especially you thirch! hehe. Although the thick burger comment did have me rolling in the floor from a previous experience earlier tonight that a coworker didn't believe me about the guy at hardee's so we went back and he doubled my fries and gave me an extra burger no charge heh. So yeah all in all my day was long and boring nothing new happened. I really need to get out more.

"event","In a joking manner perhaps but one none-the-less. ON that note what I'm speaking of is just random flirting with a few good friends you know who you are, and the guy (yes the guy) at hardee's tonight on the way home so so so hit on me... imagine that. Gave me a discount and didn't touch me so I'm not complaining. Nice guy good food eh oh well. But yeah went and saw underworld before work today was quite a good movie and I'd highly recommend anyone with a sense of fantasy to go see it. Kinda a Romeo and Juliet meets the matrix kinda deal but it was good. But as for work, once again I do believe I might be fired tomorrow for I am going to rip my co-worker kevin a new one for leaving me with his job on top of mine, AFTER I get off from the morning shift of the second job mind you. Either way today was pretty good, even got some doughnuts and coffee... thats a plus! Guess I shall bid you goodnight.

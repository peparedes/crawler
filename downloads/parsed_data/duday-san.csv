"event","- bakit 'pag si sharon, ""medical procedure"", 'pag ibang tao, liposuction?
- nakakapanibago na sa ibang tao na natin malalaman ang ulat panahon, hindi na kay ka-ernie
- uulan pa kaya bukas? kasi 'pag umulan bukas, hassle
- kelan kaya babayaran ni daddy ang inabono ko sa thesis? mahigit 
sanlibo din yun ah...
- anong klaseng maikling kwento kaya ang magandang gawin?
- hindi ko pa nagagawa presentation ko!!! *sabunot kulot na buhok*
- sana pumasa ako sa defense...
- three weeks to go before concert!!!
- four weeks to go before finals!!!
- ok that didn't help...

"event","cmon, it's just my 2nd entry! *woops, light bulb moment* no matter how one tries to be individualistic, one always ALWAYS has to look for something (or someone) to.. well, imitate is not really the right word - hmm, more of look for inspiration. this journal thing is no different. so i searched for a friend here and looked at her page. so there. wala lang. 

anyhoo, i was supposed to write about something else, but this being a more, um, how to say this, entry-worthy topic for me at this moment, ito na lang. i was pretty amazed that one could actually reformat the look of one's page and clip in pictures. sorry, i just discovered fire. i'll let my friend fix this for me, but i plan to learn how someday. btw, she's currently nursing a dream to become a graphic artist *proud of her* 

i'll start looking for nice pictures. hehe"

"event","... not exactly a nice combination. i got this idea from my uncle when he went to china. he was gravely disappointed, i think, because he expected his trip to be wall space-worthy, instead he ended up eating noodles in a dirty sidewalk and the (not-so-hospitable) native serving him nothing more than what he ordered, chopsticks, and bathroom tissue. 

well, at least he got to travel (if only to experience disappointment), because i've always to do that, even if the experience may be as disorienting as a bowl of noodles and bathroom tissue. 

so there. by the way, my uncle is gay."

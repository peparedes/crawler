"event","<center>I just did the math on exactly how much I am [not] eating. I get a surge of pride and dread at the same time, my hands freezing, my stomach tossing hungry dry heaves this way and that.

150 calories a day.

There are seven days in a week. Seven days add up to 1030 calories, which is still half of what a normal person eats in a day, and 30 calories above what would be considered a starvation diet (in terms of daily, not weekly)!





Just how much is 150 calories?





Half a muffin.

Less than two small apples.

About four red and white mints.

A slice of bread with a table spoon of jam.

A cup of whole milk.

Less than three oreos.

A small BITE of macoroni and cheese.

NOT all of these things together. Pick one. There is 150 calories, bon appetite. Good-bye fridge - see you tomorrow.

I do not write this for pity, and I feel terrible for causing so much fuss, for being such a damn puss that I can not even take a bite of dinner without tearing up, with out scale numbers blinking before my eyes. Part of me loves it when I look pathetic, because GOOD, then people will CARE.

But I know they care.

Fuck, it rips me apart to know that every week, on Saturday, Jenn will watch my cheek bones grow closer to my face, cradling tears that were accidently summoned by something so nonchalant, so casual, that no one - save for her, miraculously - will understand, and will feel the springs on the bed bending slightly less when I sit down. And I wonder if even my tears are warm. Being a thousand miles away from this, like Brandie, must be absolutely horrifying. I love them both and want to die for how much of an uproar my abstemious nature is causing. [Abstemious nature, ha. I make it sound so admirable.]

I think my mother has noticed my small weightloss, what with her sudden surge of comments on weight, calories, and self-criticisms. I think she realizes that I am thinner than I was before. I think that she believes that I am thinner than her now. I think she might be correct.

And fuck, fuck, fuck! - I do not care about the physical ramifications of this. I care far more about the worries I am imposing on those select few that actually care (you know who you are =)) than whether or not I look like Kate Moss again, but the disorder does not let me belief that.

"event","<center>Misty is going to be put down. Too many allergies. Twenty five years old. Too old.

I found out yesterday, and I went to sleep, restless with paranoia, mind concocting the wildest of schemes. I wept myself into a state of calm. Then I drifted onwards.

And I dreamed so vividly of Nina's death that I thought it had actually happened, my body closing in on itself with dread, and if her damn husband would just pick up the phone when I call to tell me what was happening...

I have not heard from her in months, and with the dying of my horse, everything seems to be jaded into a state of not giving a... But that is a lie, I do care, I care more than anything. I have sat here for a few hours, typing up a short story about birds, emotions transforming into images.








Then I sat down outside, on my porch steps, sad that it is in the 60's F, wondering where winter went - did it die with them? Is all of my beloved snow gone?

I sang in soft tones ""Prospero's Speech"" by Loreena Mckennitt.

And a bird, a small, gray creature, came and sat by the bush next to me, upon the closing words of, ""... Let your indulgence set me free.""





I rose with a sad smile, walked inside, and did something that I have not done in weeks, something frightening, something that should claw at my insides with guilt, with horror, that unspeakable thing, that action that keeps me up at night, but I did anyway, because it was the right thing...

I ate breakfast.


..::And now my charms are all o'erthrown
And what strength I have's mine own
Which is most faint; now t'is true
I must be here confined by you


But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill, or else my project fails,
Which was to please. 
Which was to please. 
Now I want spirits to enforce, art to enchant
And my ending is despair,
Unless I be relieved by prayer


Which pierces so that it assaults 
Mercy itself and frees all faults
As you from crimes would pardon'd be
Let your indulgence set me free.::.. </center>"

"event","<center>Falling apart. Completely a mess. I feel so arrogant and self-hating at the same time. I hate myself for thinking I am good at something, but not truly thinking, just... Feeling, for a split second. I am not allowed to feel good about a short story, my singing voice, my body, my penmanship. I have been writing in cursive non stop for the past few days, tracing Edwardian script over waxed parchement - and when I can finally do it well, my letters finally legible, dear God! - it's not what I want. I can't do this. I am not allowed to be good at this.

Maybe my voice and hands should be locked away. I used to crave compliments for the things I did well, but that's so forbidden. I AM NOT ALLOWED TO BE GOOD AT SOMETHING. I laid there last night (or is it lie? Lay? What a wonderful writer I am, fucking up the most simple of grammatical lessons) just listening to a short story flow through my head. One that may never be written. Senor Steel and his conversations with Wisteria, my hand absent mindedly fumbling for my notebook, not finding it, grabbing loose leaf, and scribbling down ""Eyes the color of teastains on an old danishrug."" I left the spelling errors in. Standing in the cupola. The part when he turns his gray eyes towards his beloved and <i>laughs</i>.

There is no escape from this... I pick up a pencil and I draw. If it turns out badly, I am a terrible artist with no future, worthless, horrible, full of empty blustering - if it is beautiful, I have broken the rules. I am not allowed to be good at something. Deny that the picture is good. Close the sketch book. Smile. <i>Laugh.</i> Turn on the computer, write a short story - is it good? Did you break the rules again? Or are all of your hopes of being published one day trampled into the dirt? Turn off the computer. Write, in cursive, ""I will not drink of thy vintage wine, my dear..."" and admire the slopes of each letter - can't be good at that. Not allowed. You are forbidden. Put down the pen again.

Go to the kitchen.

Fail or succeed? Fat or thin? Are you a success? How much self control do you have? Another fork in the road instead of my mouth.

I feel terrible for admitting that I might be good at something, none the less more than one thing. It's not allowed, it's not fair! Why should I have a nice voice, or an intricate sketch book, or elegant penmanship, or a talent with words, or an expansive vocabulary?

Singing was luck. I had a pretty voice. I wanted to improve it, and I took lessons (6th grade, haha!), and I worked my ass of on them. Drawing? I was not always a good artist. In 6th grade (again!), I started sketching tirelessly, portraits, portraits, people, disguises... Fucking everything. Sketchbooks upon sketchbooks full. Hands coated gray with pencil led. My penmanship? It was simply dreadful before 6th grade (didn't you see that coming?)but I would sit there, in my room, carving letter upon letter of my own invention until writing legibly was natural. Writing? Not a natural talent either, was it? I don't know. It was... It was innate. Constantly writing, always seeing things differently. Always day dreaming as a child, playing with dolls, make believing, and NARRATING EVERYTHING IN MY HEAD. I saw pieces of writing that truly moved me. I wanted to write like them. So I picked up the pen some more. 6th grade.

Too fat, too fat. You used to be naturally thin but now, haha, look! Puberty (6th grade, 6th grade, 6th grade) and you must be perfect. Perfect all aspects about yourself. GET THINNER.

Perfectionist, aren't you, my dear?

So you worked your ass off to excel, constantly wanting to learn new information, reading dictionaries, loving the taste of words, craving more, wanting to BE more, drawing pictures, practicing calligraphy, exercising, starving, singing, singing, singing...

Only to be ashamed when your efforts came true. To feel that you are arrogant for recognizing that yes, you worked hard for everything you have, it wasn't just handed to you... Therefore you are below someone with a natural talent. A lesser being.

I get so tired of not being thin enough to warrant care, impatiently watching the numbers tick downward, scared to even drink water after 1:00 AM because of a few ounce difference that could occur 8 hours from then. Normality is boring, and ultimately sufferable. So many ways I can justify this. ""Scientists prove that eating 30% less than normal (which means 1,400 calories! Way ahead of you, doc!) can lengthen your life span."" ""Red wine reduces obesity risk (yeah, but alchoholic beverages increase your appetite).""

It gives me a feeling of arrogance to scroll through newspaper headlines, reciting all of their weightloss findings back to them, reading about the fat content of fast food when I can tell them, down to the calorie, just how bad each thing on McDonald's menu is.

When someone tells me that they're hungry, I want to laugh.

I was carrying three water pitchers, my hair bound into pigtails, water dripping down my hands. Even with my eyes cast toward the floor, 100 watt smile beaming from my face, I could see the silhouette of a skeleton, and that's exactly who it was.

This beautiful, broken, hopelessly sad woman named Nina stood there, her thighs smaller than my wrists, cheekbones carved into an expression of polite glee that tore me in half. Her teeth were bleached white, hair wisping around her shoulders in scarlet tufts, somehow stretching towards the middle of her back. Everything about her... Elegant, abysmal, beautiful, wretched, forsaken, tragic, disasterous. When she spoke, it was in soft tones, as if even her voice was too heavy for her, and as she gesticulated wildly, her cracking, bluish fingernails trailing comet streams into the air.

I wanted to cry.

We ended up talking for over two hours, her ushering me into her room, complaining about the cafeteria food, having to fast for the longest time because of blood tests. She has osteoperosis, kidney problems, digestive issues, and is no longer menstruating. I took in every detail; the way she never stopped moving, refusing to sit down, batting at the air like a little kitten.... The way she wanted to discuss the menu, the cafeteria, the cold temperature of the room (it must have been over 80 degrees in there.)

I looked up at her, smiling a mournful expression. ""I used to have an eating disorder.""

She stopped cold. Leaned in closer. Gave an all-too-knowing grin. I reached behind me and closed the door.

""Actually, you know what?"" She whispered, and I wondered if the weight of the air was too much pressure against her shoulders. ""I have an eating disorder - ever since my son was born a year ago, I relapsed. I've had it for 10 years, ever since I was 18...""

I shook my head, my face the epitome of sadness. ""... I know.""

The intimate details of my anorexia were immediately spilled to her, the emotions I felt, the way I knew that she would not sit down because of the caloric burn. My story was interspersed with ""I'm not judging you,"" and ""It's okay, it's really going to be okay...""

Each time we hugged, I nearly cried. ""You feel skinny,"" she said, and her voice was soft and complimentary.

""Haha, oh yeah, I'm the skinny one here..."" I laughed sarcastically. My tone shook a little bit, loosing it's humor.

""Don't cry, honey. It's okay."" She murmured, patting my back.

My head felt like it was cradled in thin, jagged stone as I tried my best not to hurt her, to not put any weight on that bird-like body. ""... It's just that you remind me so much of myself.""

****

Whenever I asked if she wanted me to leave, she wouldn't tell me not to. She would BEG me, loneliness seeping from her, to stay.

After about 10 minutes of talking, she sat down, saying, ""Can you stay for dinner? You make this much easier. I feel like it would be much easier if you were here. See? Look, I can sit down. I can feel myself untensing, I don't feel the need to exercise so much. I mean, if you can't, it's alright...""

I immediately sat down in the chair beside her, not wanting her to feel lazy for being the only one 'not burning as many calories.' When my new found friend offered me a sugarless candy, I immediately accepted. She wanted one, that's why she offered. Nina didn't have to tell me that. But if she ate alone, she'd feel fat, I knew she would, because that's exactly how I had always felt. Fatter. And her bmi is 11.

I sucked on the candy as we continued to talk, exchanging numbers... She made a few phone calls, asking if there was anything low fat on the menu, etc. For her kidneys. She became very annoyed when I asked her if it really was for her kidneys, and after showing me the doctor's menus for her, the rules, the regulations, I believed her. Sometimes, I felt that she was annoyed with my presence... But at all times, I knew she was dependent on it.

I talked to her Aunts while she was getting a catscan, and they discussed the disorder with me, asking what the best things to say were, how they should approach this, and I really wish I knew what to say. There isn't anything. Just be loving, supportive, understanding. Avoid the topic of weightloss and calories at all times. Keep no magazines around the house.

So many things happened, I wish I could explain them all.

I'm going back tomorrow, crossing my fingers to all hell that both Ryan and Nina will be there.

Hi, it's Livvy again. We've got to talk.

This whole ""LIFE IS A MARATHON OF PAIN"" thing. Is it anywhere's near over yet? It's cool if it's not, I know how it is - you're busy up there, trying to keep those sinners away from Apple Bees every Sunday. I was just kind of curious if you'd penciled in a break for me anytime soon, because listening to my mother yell about how I'm ""Getting worse, slipping back into depression, refusing to exercise, refusing to do school work, refusing to go see the horses, etc etc."" is a bit tiring.

Especially since I was sitting there, with the lap top clacking away beneath my fingers, working on an essay for World History.

You have this habit of taking away everything that means something to me. I know, I know. You're busy. Lots of fish to divide for those poor, starving children in Africa. Thanks for taking care of that, by the way, because UNICEF is SOOOO shadey. What? You haven't gotten around to that yet? ... In any event, I was kind of hoping that you'd kind of chill out for a moment. I haven't volunteered at the hospital for over a week now, and it was one of the few things that I loved. I know, holy shit! I had a shot at being a normal teenager with an actual BOYFRIEND for a minute, silly me for hoping that this lagniappe wouldn't be taken away.

I kind of like the color purple.

Want to take that away too?

I guess those words are kind of strong.

A lot of emotions cloud my head every day. I am not hopeless, but I am certainly not, by any means, optimistic. I hate it how the people close to me seem to be dodging their words, picking and choosing what syllables to deliver, testing their own tact. Reading between the lines is a skill acquired from a life time without precision. My mathematical skills are horrible, but this...

There's an awkward kind of stillness hanging around me.

I feel like I'm waiting for gears to shift in a broken clock, that I'm anticipating something - some reward, recognition, or for another ""r"" word, retribution - that's not really going to happen. Do I know what I want? Have I blossomed into a swan?; Or is that another mislead anxiety?

Writing seems to be my only escape, once again, although a lot of times I write in circles. Winter, insanity, loneliness... Characters who are forlorn and shadowed, lost somewhere in their own heads. They find someone that they never really meant to find, have something that was never really theirs, and loose everything because they tried to hold on just a little too tight, <i>pretending, wanting, loving. </i> that <i> something </i> was actually meant to happen. I never write with a certain situation of my life in mind. Nothing ever happens that way when I pick up the pen, pull up Word, etc. But those places say it for me, those words, those ""Lost in an endless winter,"" ""December roses are the most beautiful,"" ""Something keeps pulling us apart,"" phrases. I don't know what they mean when I write them, not entirely.

My goal is to never make someone understand my stories entirely, but to let them feel some pull deep down, on some level, and that will be different for everyone. Maybe that's not even it. Perhaps there is no destination. Mayhap it's up to you.

So you're saying that you're tired, alone, tired of being alone, unable to understand why you do the things you do, 'Lost in an endless winter,' so to speak, unable to look ahead without seeing a certain, impending disaster?





Something like that.

"event","<center>So I worked a lot on my school work this weekend, because I really wanted to see Elaine off before she left the hospital.

And my mother, aftering agreeing to this plan, changed her mind.

""You should have gotten your lazy ass out of bed earlier! [I got up at 7 AM] Yada yada yada I TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF YOU! Myah myah myah...""

Anyone can tell from listening to her stupid, belligerent psychobabble for two seconds that she's obviously out of her mind. She sits there, calling me irresponsible and lazy, then goes off to work her job at fucking Marshall's. No matter how many times I explain things to her, I have to walk her through them like a child, and even then it doesn't sink in. I have a feeling that I won't get to see Ryan often. I'd like to give life a big ol' thanks for taking any hope I get, and smashing it into the floor.

She gets back at either 3 PM or 4, I'm not sure which, and I can only hope that Elaine hasn't left by then, and that Ryan is still working, even if it's just for a little while.

She's screaming at me to do my algebra, and I have the page for it pulled up on the computer. I told her that it said there were no assignments available. She screamed at me for being ""passive aggressive"" and everything else that you can cram into 3 paragraphs of haranguing. I try to view these instances as tests. See how much self control you have, see how long you can endure this spouting of bull shit until you finally crack and call her a horrible, nasty, noisome, fucking assmite. The only thing that kept me from doing so is that she'd never take me to the hospital again if I did.

""She won't get out this early anyway! Doctor's always take people out in the afternoons!""

""Suzanne was out by eleven, mom.""

""Oh okay, so you're ALWAYS RIGHT! ALWAYS FUCKING RIGHT! Stop being so lazy! I'm the only one who takes care of you and aasdkghakghfehaghfh;kgdhk!!!""

This woman's really busting my chops.

I wish someone would be happy for me, or at least, PRETEND to be.

I finally met someone whom I'm generally attracted to, the first time in my life that my feelings have been reciprocated. I started volunteering at the hospital a few days ago, and one of the first faces to strike me was that of a twenty year old named Ryan's, memorial tattoos of angels and skulls poking out from beneath his scrubs, eyes framed by sharp, black glasses. There was nothing about me that was overly subcultural. Nothing that would have turned his head.

I developed a love for Virtua, none the less.

I have befriended many people there, in particular, two elderly women by the names of Elaine and Suzanne, a very comforting and talkative pair of roommates. I discussed how I wanted to be a tattoo artist after I got my nursing degree, yada yada, speaking about this, that and the other, and I was quickly stopping in between water runs and changing linens to talk to them. As a volunteer, they want you to talk to the patients, which is why there is no time limits. I would have stayed anyway.

Then they mentioned Ryan.

***

Today, I came into their room and we began our conversations. The pair was just as cheery as they'd always been, talking about the soup, or anything that had come to our minds...

When they told me that Ryan was asking about me, my eyes widened, and my hand shot to my mouth.

They said that they'd told him all about my love for ink, my desires to be a tattoo artist. He was very interested in meeting me, getting to know me, etc, and I thought that I might fall over. Laughing like a hyena, I told them that I thought he was cute, Elaine telling me that we'd make quite a match... I told them I'd get their water and I'd be right back, acting as casual as I could.

And just as I entered the hall, guess who was 20 feet behind me?

We stood for a moment, as if shocked at eachother's presence, like we didn't both patrol these hallways day in and day out. I smiled. He smiled back. And I sought out the ice machine, trying desperately to soothe my jangled nerves at what had just happened. It was the irony more than anything. The very person I was talking about, stomach fluttering over, had been attracted from the moment I'd walked in, actually felt the same way?

My God.

Clutching the soup crackers and the water pitchers, I had to resist laughing at the whole thing, at how truly stupid I was being. It'd been a while since I'd even felt a shred of a crush, and it was nice. I kind of felt like a seventeen year old is supposed to feel. Despite homeschooling and never getting out of the house, when I finally DID start getting out more, holy shit, I encountered fascination.

I nearly smacked right into him, taking the corner too fast.

We both laughed, him asking if I was alright, and me apologizing profusely, giggling like an idiot. He told me that it was fine, and even as we walked by, both of us still chuckling, there was a long few moments of eye contact, looking over our shoulders...

By the time I entered Suzanne and Elaine's room again, I was nearly red in the face.







And everyone was in such a bad mood today, that they told me straight up that they didn't want to hear about it.

"event","<center>Amanda stopped by tonight (yay!). We went to McDonald's, ordered the worst fries in the world, demanded our money back, and chilled the next hour or so away.

Our conversations always set an inner sort of conflict to work in myself.

Everytime I think, breathe, clear my throat, brush my hair, wash my face, turn off the TV, pick up my guitar, eat breakfast... It's becomming more and more clear that I am either loosing small parts of myself, or gaining them. I don't know how to explain it, but it's there, everywhere - and especially in my conversations with her. This isn't necessarily bad. In fact, I like it. It gives my mind something to really chew over. In all honesty, it happens with everyone, not just Amanda, but in different ways. For her, it's our conversations. For Amber, it's in her gesticulations. For Brandie, it's when she says ""darn,"" or ""Imma."" For you,

Well, for you? For you, for you. It's always been for you, hasn't it?

Our laptop computer broke, so we replaced it with a much faster, sleeker, shorter 'n wider contraption. Say hello to The Computinator. I was scrolling through radio stations, and I was torn between these two choices: Classic Punk, or Classical...

And I think that, that moment, that infinitesimal instant of indecision, left every gear in my head clicking out of place. Polar opposites - punk rock and classical. Buzzcocks or Beethoven. Leftover Crack vs. Vivaldi.

It made it more clear than ever that I am alone, that there really aren't many people out there who could shift moods so instantaniously, and appreciate completely different ends of a spectrum.

And I think that I'm okay with that.

I am not a punk rocker. You probably couldn't classify me as a goth, either. I'm certainly not part of the ""in-crowd"" and I'm not good enough at math to be a nerd. I laugh too much - I cry too much. I love the opera and I love basement shows, and while I disdain people who depend on relationships... Deep down, I crave connection, interaction, and love, more than anything.

I want beauty and chaos to walk hand and hand.

"event","<center>I miss Face. She hasn't been around lately. I could rant about that all day, so I should probably avoid that...

I passed my permit test yesterday, and mom's making me drive once daily (which I'm glad for), but I hit and killed a turtle! *weeps* And mom yelled at me for almost going in a ditch when I was trying to avoid hitting a car. She said she'd rather me collide with a jeep than hit that hole. o_O.... I decided not to argue.

Fictionpress is my best friend. I've been writing a lot on there. Not much else to do.

And Alex is considering going out with Shorty! Now, I know that hormones can drive people to do crazy things, but Jesus Christ...

So we'll see how everything is after he has his make out session with her today. She told him that she'd like to date him on instant messenger last night, and he said that he didn't know...

Logically, he's aware that saying yes will fuck him ass over elbows (perhaps literally) but then again, he is a 17 year old boy. Can't fight those urges. Why am I having such an easy time with this? We have both been single ever since our break up in the November of 05, and even longer before that. Maybe it's a chick thing.

I just don't see what's wrong with masturbating rather than tea-bagging a dirty whore on her horse farm.

"event","<center>I want to be perfect for someone.

All life is a stage - but the girl I cast as myself is very different than I actually am, in appearence, emotions... Everything.

I'm not sure where I found this actress. Long black hair, deep blue eyes. She has the ability to walk into a room and leave at least one person fumbling for words. Somehow, whether it's a single gliding step or a 100 watt smile, she manages to make someone feel like they are the only person in the world. And a light goes on. They connect.

Pft, yeah, right.

I look into a mirror and I don't see myself as I really am - I see how far I need to go to BECOME an image that describes me. <i>You really love long hair. You should grow it out. That will take three years, maybe. That's not too long. You'll be about 20. Oo! Then you can dye it black. That color has always suited you somehow. And about those eyes... </i> I know, really. I'm thinking blue? Contact lenses are a safe option, SO LONG AS YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION. And that's easy to get.

Then what?

There's a long list that I have for myself, and it makes for a very love/hate relationship. I love having a goal to work towards, something to look forward to. But at the same time, it's desparaging because I want to know that I'm good enough for someone RIGHT NOW, not when I'm thinner, not when my hair touches my hips, not when my eyes are some artificially enigmatic blue.

I've thought about this more than I would like to admit. Not just sitting down and pondering myself or anything, but gathering little snippets of thoughts together and watching as they merge into one, final conglomeration. Who am I?  Why do I do the things I do? What do I look for in a person? It's strange. My eyes are completely open to love, but I don't know what I want. Who I want. If they exist, even.

Well, now that that can of worms is opened....

Some type of beauty, but not necessarily the stereotypical kind. I want to look at them and see depth, like an ocean, rather than staring at the plastic, factory round rocks at the bottom of a coy pond. It's hard to tell that at first sight. It's hard to know what a person's all about. But somehow, at the end of the conversation, you'll know if you... Connect.

He doesn't have to be loud. He doesn't have to be quiet, either. He doesn't have to be shy or dark or even appropriate all the time. What does he have to be?

Thoughtful. I need a sense of humor. Even telling stupid jokes that no one ever laughs at is fine with me, because I probably <i>will laugh</i>. And even if I don't, it still makes the situation so much more pleasant, because they're smiling. That means you're smiling. The air just gets one million times lighter.

Someone who is open-minded. If I put something like 'Cinema Strange' in the cd player, the last thing I want him to do is act disgusted and quiet. They don't have to like my music. Shit, Alex hated A.F.I., and we laughed about it all the time. It never got in the way. Just laugh about it and make a joke, even a stupid one, because you know that I will laugh (didn't I just say that?) but don't suddenly see me as a freakish insect that needs to be crushed quickly.

I don't care if he's a neat freak or not, just don't judge me for being so inconsistent in that sense. There are times when my room looks like a trash dump - other times, it's immaculate. I spent two days scrubbing the putrid odor out of Rachel's car (soon to be mine, woo!), vacuuming every trace of dust, vowing to never litter the ground with a single piece of trash - not to mention that I've washed my face three times today.

Someone who's affectionate and sweet. I love being kissed, and having my hand squeezed when I least expect it. Don't stick your tongue down my throat in public places. In my past kissing experience, I really did not find it enjoyable... But when I create a scenario in my head, one with a person who makes my stomach turn in circles, there is nothing else I'd rather be doing.

Physically?

I want to say I'm not picky, but that would be a lie. Kind of.

Goths/emos are really my ideal. He doesn't have to be super thin, but if he is, it's okay. Pale skin is a big turn on, and so are tattoos, but they aren't necessary. Long, black hair is my favorite... But I'm open minded to so many styles; the choppy, ""I'm so dark!"" swath over the face look, the Sing the Sorrow dramatic locks, maybe just something wild and crazy (because we all know that I love hair dye), a trihawk... Whatever. Something subcultural.

I just want to be good enough, more than anything. I have this thing in my head that I can't seem to get out, a philosophy that somehow burned itself in my subconcious. Are you ready?

<i>If I am somehow good enough, if I just become more attractive, smart, funny, somehow... Then I'll find someone, or they will find me. </i>

The world is a very shallow place. Hell, do I even want love? I don't know. But I would enjoy sitting down in some place - a McDonald's, a bowling alley, a Starbucks - Christ, I don't care, and just connecting with someone. Even if we just parted after a cup of coffee and a conversation, offering eachother a quick ""Thanks!"" and never saw eachother again, it would be great to know that I made an impression. That maybe, a few hours later (or days, or weeks, or months...) they would wonder how I was, and if I was still out there, somewhere.

Maybe that's wishful thinking.

You guessed it - this is a rant on music, If you're sensitive to my criticisms on this sort of thing, click back, click back, CLICK BACK!

I just head ""Call Me When You're Sober,"" by Evanescence....

So disappointed.

It was a really simple, piano harmony over-layed with Christina Aguilara-esque vocals for the introduction, with a Faith Hill'y sort of... Thing? - if you slapped her in a black wig and maybe some make up. The first verse wasn't so bad, it got back some of that crushing, Evanescence SMASH! that we all love, but then it reverted back to a very simple, over done refrain that I think I've heard everywhere, especially on CMT. I hate to say it, but it sounded so country! Or maybe like Alicia Keys.

It reminded me of when I first heard ""Miss Murder,"" by AFI. A dark band that drifted slightly into the pop category, then redeemed themselves with a dark, mournful ballad at the end of the cd (Endlessly, She Said, anyone?) and with certain accents from The Cure to hold up the rest of the album. A Fire Inside came dangerously close to selling out, but I like to think that it was part of their evolution from straight up punk rock to a more mature, modern feel (though I'm still crossing my fingers for them to go back!).

Or like when I heard Emilie Autumn's ""How Strange."" I panicked because I was worried she was straying into that hip-hop category.... But then I heard the rest, and I was very much relieved. ""Combine the violin mastery of Nigel Kennedy, the voice of some alien Siouxsie/Reznor hybrid, and the looks of a post-apocalyptic Marie Antoinette, and what do you get? Emilie Autumn."" She was still awesome.

I have two plans of action:

Either I buy ""The Open Door"" and force myself to like it no matter what (which hopefully won't be too hard to do) Or....

Give up on Evanescence and expand my Sirenia collection. O_O Dear God, that would make me sad.

Livvy, stop being so picky about music! XD

Exercise and calorie intake is now talked about so much in my house that I became nausious last night, got a head ache, and spent about an hour shaking. Picture the flu, only purely induced by anxiety over my body, the pressure to do something about it conflicted with the urge to strangle my family, to give in, to get up and run around the block and throw up the 600 calories I've consumed that day.

I'm lowering my calorie intake to 300 daily.

And I've decided to embroider a heart on to my black, taken in, safety pinned sweatshirt every time I feel upset, rather than cut myself. One self destructive habit should be done away with.

I convince myself to eat two mini bagels. Not too caloric. It's about 9 in the morning. It took me three hours to finally get up the balls to go to the toaster, and three failed attempts. Now here I sit, by the computer, one of them eaten and the other one screaming the words ""Calories, calories... 120 calories.""

Oh wait, that's my mother.

""Can you believe that these have 120 calories? Why is it that much? Aren't these just like... slices of bread?""

I pause midchew. ""It's a starch. Starches are meant to give you energy.""

""Ah, I don't know too much about this stuff... Oh look! The hamburger rolls, too! 120 calories. Guess you're right."" 

I have the urge to slice my neck open and pour the food contents out of my stomach, and for a moment, I forget how much cream cheese is on my breakfast and notice that mom has talked about calories almost obsessively since I've come home.

Quit stressing me to exercise. Quit ranting to me about fat content and units of energy because whether you believe I have a disorder or not, the POSSIBILITY that you COULD be killing your daughter should be enough to shut you the fuck up. It shouldn't HAVE to be a solidified fact. If a man put a gun to your loved one's head and threatened to pull the trigger, would you remain calm if he said that some of the bullets were blanks?

I'm staring at a picture of me at 110 pounds. The women's size two overalls are hanging off me. My smile's so big I'm surprised my bones could support it, a large, garish grin on a stark white, denim clad girl.

This just might be sorted out. At least, it's beginning to be.

I finally know what I want to do in life, and I have the courage to say it.

I want to become a suicide girl as my own way of saying ""FUCK YOU!"" to society's pressures to be thin, my mother, and anyone else who turns a deaf ear towards alternative beauty. I want to flaunt some ink. By 21, that's who I want to become, I want to be the girl with violet tipped hair who has a killer amount of confidence. I'm plotting out tattoos, hairstyles, and all sorts of other things as we speak. Believe it.

I want to finish all of my school work, study like a fiend for my driver's test, get a job as fast as I can, SAVE UP MONEY, and move the fuck out. I'll get my cosmotology license and I'll become a mortuary beauticean. The skills with make up I learn there will only be beneficial with SG.

And if Suicide Girls doesn't accept me, I'll move on to metal magazines, Goth Beauty, anything.... I don't care. I want to model. Not because I believe that I'm the hottest little thing that's ever walked the planet, but because I'm tired of bleach blondes dominating the scene and fake tans being the norm. I'm really trying to build up my confidence, and a lot of the times, it's an uphill battle, but I need to try.

I think after all of this bullshit, asking for this one thing really isn't too much - I hope the world agrees.

There are no direct answers. Only well founded theories.

In short, my mother screamed at me how much she hated me, in those words, even. That I was a fat, ugly, bloated blimp... etc. ""You don't have an eating disorder, you're too FAT! Look at you!! YOU'RE A FAT DISGUSTING PIG, YOU EAT ALL THE TIME!!!!"" I'm perfectly aware that I am not thin, and that I am, beyond all reason, a failure. Which is why killing myself really is the only option left.

I have to call my doctor back, and in all honesty, since I don't know what to say, I seriously am considering killing myself first.

Her insecurity is shown by her self reassurance over a point that was implied. That makes me grin. If you had class, you wouldn't post provocative pictures on myspace.com in the first place, so why bother demanding that people stop requesting naked pictures of you? If you would like those comments to stop, take the pictures down. Learn to control your emotions. Cool down and think for a moment.

Afterall, even though their delusions themselves are different, they are each very rigid to a system, transfering their own flaws to others because, like a mirror, it's easier to see something that's right in front of you than <i>on</i> you. This is why I'm not angered by her controdictions anymore. It's just a lesson she has yet to learned. I've memorized it, and I've moved on to the next one. It's a shame that life's teachings are without order - sometimes without attendance altogether.

And if her rigid mind set continues, she will end up just like her mother: close minded, whether it's to the same spectrum or not, boxed in by arguments of her own making, judgement tainted by self superiority. There is nothing you can say which will break through this enclosure, which is why I didn't bother, because you'll find yourself victim to another onslaught of misplaced anger.

AFI's new album Decemberunderground was, for the most part, less than satisfactory.

And for me, that's like God taking a shot below the belt, if you know what I'm saying. 

AFI was one of those fucking bands - hell, maybe the only band - that I could listen to and actually feel something. Their music sounded AWFUL in the beginning, what with Answer That And Stay Fashionable... But that's why it was great! It wasn't about the sound or the chicks throwing their panties or the emo kids dying their hair. It wasn't about raking in cash or selling their autographs to whatever poor soul would buy them. It was making a statement that ""Yeah, we don't have to cater to what's popular, we're doing what we love"" and that was pretty damn cool. I loved it. You could hear it in the screams and guitar riffs that they were doing whatever they wanted, writing about things from bowling teams to intense ponderings of life and death, beautiful analogies about the seasons to chucking cereal at eachother.

Then they sold out.

Decemberunderground is what I like to call, ""The Fuck Up Album"". Every band has one, this isn't anything new. The Bouncing Souls just did it with their latest cd ""The Gold Record"", Theatre of Tragedy with ""Aegis"", and most likely Evanescence with ""The Open Door"" which will be hitting the scene in October. There are more bands, I just can't remember right now. I'm trying to piece together what the hell I can expect in the future from the bands that I've grown to love most, but am slowly beginning to doubt...

AFI is still, by far, my favorite band in existence and I cling to every word in Decemberunderground... But I can't help but feel like they're gearing themselves towards the emo crowd because it's what's popular. Now, here's where there is a ray of hope:

They change with EVERY SINGLE ALBUM. Just because Decemberunderground was emo does not mean their next one (please God, let their be a next one...) will be. We change, that's all. Everything changes. Set aside your preconceptions about shitty emo music and you will find that underlying emotion in their latest recording, and that same old AFI that you love. But you'll have to be a pretty fucking die hard fan to do that...

I'm still excited as fuck about the upcoming show, though. :D

Okay, sorry. I just had to get that out of my system. There are other things on my mind right now, but I really don't feel like typing them.









Remember.... Beauty fades. It goes away eventually. No matter how much dieting we do, no matter how much make up we put on or how long we spend in front of the mirror... We're all going to grow old. We're all going to wither. And we will, all, eventually, DIE.

It must be so silly to be this young, and already I'm tired of the world. Not in that girly, ""Oh my God I hate my life!"" sense, but I have this constant feeling that I have no direction. I have a few goals in life, to be perfectly clear. And none of them are ordinary.

Let me show you in no particular order:

1] Become a mortuary beautician.
2] Buy a hearse, get it custom painted with some Alan Forbe style jack-o-lantern landscape.
3] Grow my hair out. Start a wig collection.
4] Write novels and get them published on the side.
5] Dress purely in victorianesque period goth attire, cutting out the words ""Yeah"" ""Cool"" and unnecessary ""like""'s.
6] Become proficient in German.

I don't think anyone has a list of goals like that. Who the fuck? I mean, really? Is there anyone out there who is as disgusted with the world as I am today, or further more, with themselves? I find darkness and women in vampiric attire beautiful. Bats and black cats have my heart. My celebrity crush's last names are Havok, Filth, and Henrie - now don't I sound like a cliche little goth girl? A strange wave of melancholy has swept over me since last September, the after shock of what I saw as a cataclysmic event, and I'm still submerged.

I look back and I see loneliness. I've far surpassed that now.

Isn't this just ironic? How all of my friend's lives are crumbling down around them and all I can focus on is my own eating disorder? Yeah, big fuckin' whoop, Olivia. You've had it since 7th grade and you've survived so far, you're not dying anytime soon, grow up. Like the classic profile of a little girl, shoes polished, screaming, ""LOOK AT ME, I'm NOT eating. Look at me. COME ON! IT'S NOT FAIR!!!! LOOK AT ME!!"" while everyone else around her is in shambles. But it's not fair. No one deserves this. The Tharp's don't deserve this.

EVERYONE DESERVES FUCKING BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'VE BEEN HANDED AND IT MAKES ME SICK THAT STILL, IN THIS WORLD FILLED WITH MONEY AND PURSUITS OF HAPPINESS, WE STILL CAN'T MAKE OURS WORK.

But maybe that's all life is: a pattern of pursuits of happiness. Maybe there is no end, not even suicide. That just kicks the shins of another traveler on this weary road, so don't bother.

Fuck, I didn't even bring my running shoes.

But I think I should elaborate on that a little more.

I'm incredibly worried about the Tharp's, horrified with Amber, disgusted with myself, and flooded with inspiration that I still can't put into words. How on earth I find myself as happy as I've been in a while is beyond me. Jenn has told me that there is an open mic night at the library soon, and I can't wait for that... well, nevermind, actually. I just checked that out. Turns out that was on the 13th and guess what... yeah, too late. FUCK!

Excited that AFI's new album (December Underground) is being realized June 6 (6/6/06, hahaha)AND that they're going to be playing in New Jersey in May. Ohhhhh yeah.

But the same old feelings of utter worthlessness regarding my figure and appearence are over-taking me again. Hell, just me in general.

Writing's been my only escape lately. I have short stories just pouring out and I've started posting them on fictionpress.net....

"event","<center>Last night sucked so much ass.

It started out with a headache, the streetlights feeling very much like lazer beams slicing through my skull. Occasionally, it flickered on and off, so I took an aspirin and was done with it. Mmm, yummy yummy. It didn't occur to me that it might be a hunger headache, seeing as my last meal consisted of an apple and sugarless pudding the night before. I perged both successfully.

I ended up curled into a bawl, beneath my covers and wishing too all hell that I would just pass out, thinking, ""My God, this is an electrolyte imbalance. This <i>has</i> to be an electrolyte imbalance."" Funny how those things can be fatal. I didn't find it funny at the time. Still don't, really, but you can't say I don't have a sense of humor about these things.

So guess what happens next.

I'm shaking and starting to cry, stomache nauseus though there was no food inside of it. A symptom of ketosis, if I remember correctly, which happens when your body is metabolizing fat instead of food. I couldn't help but take a little pleasure in that. After all of my perging and self abuse, I'd better damned well be loosing weight. A few thoughts went through my head - one of which was, call Jenn. Tell her to get her dad to take me to the crisis center, because I don't think my parents know where one is. Then I thought, ""Fuck, it's night, you can't do that.""

It was only 8:45 PM.

I decided not to, anyhow. Figured I'd rather die from a lack of sodium intake or something, whatever the hell was wrong with me. I shook and shook and felt like I was freezing and everything was like one million bullets and then it all went black.

Cut to next scene: Morning, April 1st, 2006.

I'm sitting at dinner tonight, sucking on pieces of steak, spitting them back out, and slipping them into my pocket when I need ketchup. Like, lots of fucking ketchup. Salt, too. Don't forget that. I dowsed my plate in salt, proceeding to squirt a coil of lycopeney goodness over top, then shook yet another bout of salt on it. I hardly set the salt shaker down before I started eating it with my fingers, repeating the process several times, tiny pile by tiny pile. I don't really classify that as eating. I classify that as going completely buck nutty whilst your parents don't even notice, too busy with the baseball game or whatever, as you subject yourself to a wierd game of eating disordered mania.

Next expirement: mustard and non-fat vanilla yogurt. Don't wrinkle that nose at me, missy! Wendy's honey mustard is basically mayonaisse and mustard. You can substitute mayonaisse with lite mayonaisse, which can be substituted with sour cream, which can be substituted with non-fat yogurt, but since I have vanilla non-fat yogurt, that will take care of the extra sweetness that the honey normally obliged. See? I've got ideas. It'll probably make me gag but what the fuck ever, sure beats eating.

Yup, this is an eating disorder. And this is how it kills you.

"event","<center>If you're wondering why I'm currently maintaining my weight, it's because I eat absolutely NOTHING through-out the day, then chow down at night, when no one is watching.

I just felt like I should clarify that.

I can't describe what it's like to have a binge... you're not even thinking about it, you just start shoveling and mixing and cutting up slices of bread and microwaving oatmeal on autopilot. The whole time your head is screaming, ""Fat-fat-fat-pig-calories-lookatthosecalories!!!!!!!"" whilst your body DEMANDS that you eat, you don't have a choice, and if you stop eating then my God, you're some sort of freak.

EAT NOW, BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(the calories, look at those calories! If I drink that soda I'll balloon up and pop....)

DRINK IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(I can't! I don't even like that soda, I really don't want it....)

*drinks it anyway* NOW, GET SOME OATMEAL!!!!!!!
(but that's 160 calories for the maple syrup kind, 150 for the plain kind.)

WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOUR A FAT COW UGLY LARD ASS BITCH AND YOU MAY AS WELL STUFF YOUR FACE.
(yeah, but...)
DO IT. NOW.

This goes on for a few hours. Then, suddenly, the voices switch roles!

YOU JUST ATE ALL THAT FOOD YOU FAT FUCK!!!!!!!
(you need to eat to live, you won't gain any weight)

FUCK YOU.
(what...?)
THROW UP.
(I really would rather not.)
I DON'T CARE.
(well, if you insist..)
I DO INSIST.

...

*throws up*

Then they switch back.
YOU MUST EAT EVERYTHING, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've done this 5 times in a row before, just eating until I'm uncomfortably full - past that point, even - then ran to the bathroom to vomit it up.

At least the voices agree on one thing:

I am a weak, pathetic failure.

"event","<center>I should really thank Jenn and Miki again for letting me come over, my head was in shambles.

Dehydration lead me into almost a state of mania. I kept having flashbacks of my father's abuse, would cut my arm with scissors to bring myself out of it, be reminded how thirsty I was, get up, pass out, wake up, repeat repeat repeat...

By the time morning came, I was pretty beaten down, as you could imagine. I went downstairs and hate a huge piece of chocolate cake, three brownies, an english muffin, and glass after glass of water and milk. Then, feeling like a bloated, disgusting pig, I went into the shower and threw up.

Then I called Amanda.
Work.
Amber.
Jen/Miki's.
Bakley.
No no and no! Finally I just called up Amber back and was like: ""I'm sorry, I'm on the verge of a mental meltdown, can I please go to Jen/Miki's to see you guys?"" They said that I could and I spent the day there, and it was much better than being by myself. 

But when I found out that Jen couldn't eat in front of me because she felt fat, such a tremendous blow of guilt swept over me. My God. I'm only causing pain and worry to everyone! I know how that feels, to feel completely unsure of yourself in someone elses presence and let me tell ya' - it hurts like a sonofabitch. I'm really sorry, Jenn!!

I think that everyone around me thinks that I'm doing this for attention. If so, I can't blame them, that's what I would think. Before this year, I was some pseudo hardcore bitch who didn't care what anyone thought of her. The old me would beat the shit out of the current me right now, and that's the honest truth. ""Toughen up, you whiney emo-fuck! You're making all your own problems! GET A GRIP! SHUT UP! DIIIIIIEEEEE!""

I'm so sick. Oh, pity me. Although, in all sincerity...

... I think I AM doing this for attention.

I mean, think about it. I'm never exposed to anyone. NO ONE notices me. I think that if I died, it wouldn't really matter, because I'm not even an extra face you'd see in the school halls anymore! I'm not even the empty seat in biology. I desperately need to reach out to anyone who will have me but goddamn it I can't, because I'm too embarrassed about my body to want to be seen in public. NOTICE ME. HELP ME. PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT ME.

Or maybe even.... love me?

I SOUND SO FUCKING SELF CENTERED. THINK ABOUT ME! ME ME ME ME ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","<center>It is an innate, human need to WANT to feel WANTED. Must we always be in a constant state of clinginess?

Another strange occurence happened tonight.

I was watching a video AFI's live performance of The Cure's ""Just Like Heaven,"" and I felt that giddy, adorable, warm, fluffy feeling as Davey Havok swayed with the music. I gripped each note like a child holds a stuffed bear, unwilling to let them go, burying each syllable of, ""I'll run away with you, I'll run away with you..."" deep inside of my memory. AFI always has that effect on me, see. We all have certain songs that reach just the right frequency, and that one really, truly did tonight. It was glorious.

But then... it stopped. Though no, it didn't stop, it just turned into something equally as intense. The feeling in my heart was still there but it was a familiar and wrenching sadness that tore at me, so violently I nearly cried. I realized then that I really was alone. That I'll probably never really understand any of the things that are happening to me.

I remember a few months ago, Amber came over to my house when we were having macoroni and cheese for dinner. When we went back upstairs she threw a hug around me and I wanted nothing more than to sink to the carpet, crying. I didn't. I turned my head away. I felt the prickles in my nose start to well - you know, the feeling you get before sobs arrive. I pulled away after only a few seconds, needing to, <i>having</i> to.

""I really wished you didn't hate getting hugs, Livvy,"" I remember her saying. God, I don't hate getting them. I love getting them. I can't have them because I want them too much. It makes me want to cry. Hell, writing this entry is making me want to cry.

Whenever anyone hugs me, whether it's Jenn, Miki, Amber... whomever, I get this feeling. I HAVE to pull away because I'll start crying. This is how much depression has really been eating away at me, everyone. It really and truly has been. I can't sleep and the eating... God. I don't want to eat. I want to waste away. One pound lower on the scale means I'm one pound closer to disappearing, a thought which I love.

You know what one of the things fueling my anorexia is? Brace yourselves, I've never told anyone this.

... Hugs.
I'm worried that I'll get so big no one will be able to put their arms around me.

Yeah, go ahead and laugh. I guess it's rather funny.

But think about it! I'm 5'11""! Just that fact alone means that it'll be hard for anyone to hold me nearly as close or comfortably as they could someone who was petite. Maybe if I'm frail, fragile, breakable, people will want to touch me. If I'm like some weak, porcelein doll, it will be easy to have the feeling that I am protected, simply because EVERYONE will be stronger than me. I like that feeling. I want to feel safe. How is destroying your body safe? It isn't. But it's all I know. All I know is destruction or anguish of some kind, and what's familiar is, I guess.... safe.

And don't even THINK about physical intimacy.

What if I'm having sex with someone and we can't get positioned properly, just because my thighs are too big? What if we try standing up during our activities but my leg is just too heavy to support? What if my stomach isn't perfectly flat? What if he takes one look at me and says, ""God damn it, you're fucking disgusting!"" What if what if what if.... see? I don't think I could ever have a tryst.

If I did find that one, magnificent, special person, I believe that they should have the best. I don't want them to be doing anything with me just because they're too timid to say no, too afraid to hurt my feelings. I want to be attractive to them. That means I want to be some 110 pound chick with long hair and pale skin, someone that looks like she was cut out of a magazine, someone out of a vampiric romance novel. I want to be beautiful. I want them to feel lucky.

Fat chance.
Oh look, there's that word again.

Hmm... maybe that's why I'm sorting this out with a blank expression, regardless of the churnings of the seas inside. I don't deserve pity or hugs or love or emotions or warmth. Sometimes, I swear the only reason I don't just off myself is because I don't want to crack the backs of the people carrying my body bag in half. Easy there, Heffer. Do we take this one to the morgue or to the Butcher's Shop?

So... yeah. Looks like it was an average day.

"event","<center>Florida was the emotional equivalent to stuffing a lit cigarette in my eyeball. After a week of being accused of being bulimic, screaming fights with my grandmother, abuse, almost being robbed twice and taking off in the middle of the night because we just couldn't stand the agony of being there anymore, I arrived home, called Amber, and learned of her 20 year old boyfriend.

... It's been a stressful couple of days.

The scale reads 150 lbs. and I want to kill myself for it, as we were eating out constantly in Florida and I had no idea how many calories were in that food. I flipped out and did crunches and exercises until I grew dizzy and nearly fell on my ass, proceeded to take three laxatives, a cup of green tea, and lie in bed.

The following hours were horrendous. The laxatives make your stomach clench in a terrible frenzy and you curl into a little ball crying, bereaving your own insignificance, how easily you succumb to pain. Fuck you for being human, body. You just couldn't be strong. You just couldn't be perfect. Fuck you, fuck you, FuCk YoU!

Brandie and I talked on the phone for a little while tonight, but her mother said something to her... I don't know what, she had to leave immediately... and the sobs in her voice gripped my heart like icey talons. What could this woman have possibly have said to her that would break her down so?

What glory does she feel from beating her own daughter down to the point of tears?

We are all clinging to something in desperation. Amber, to Nick. Brandie, to Bryan. Jenn, to Amber. And I? A sickening, life-threatening disorder because I don't believe I'm good enough to be with anyone, and this will have to suffice. That's the magic of eating disorders, kids. ""I'll be good enough when I'm thinner!"" is the mentality, but you're never thin enough. I could lay myself in a casket and flinch, as a long-dead, that the weight of dust on my bones was just too heavy and because I could not bear the substance, did not deserve a grave.

So we're all lonely.

*shrug* Could be worse.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I read Jenn's livejournal tonight and found that she felt so simalarly to how I have been lately. Drop my disorder and all of that, scrape away the marrow of disorder and look at the actual, clean autopsy of human nature. She wandered the streets fearlessly, not out of courage but out of numbness. I have done something simalar.

Imagine a girl, sixteen, walking through the woods. Her eyes are fixed forward and there is a stick clutched in her hand, and she's feeling the ground before her clumbsily with it as she continues along, focused on nothing in particular. You decided she's blind. She's not. She's me. Though I guess that is just as well, depending on who you ask.

I was pretending I was blind simply because I AM NOT. Because I am not blind, that means I must be someone else. That means I have a different body, one that isn't as fat. I walked for about six miles in the woods, tapping the stick along the dirt, writing the word ""FAT"" in the sand then stamping it out, saying, ""No, I'm not fat anymore. This isn't me.""

And for that time being, I'm not quite sure who I was. Just another character in this game, I suppose. Another shelf piece in the crazy-girl collection.

I go to bed crying everynight, running my hands along my thighs and gripping, feeling the pulse of unused calories and the tensity of muscle because it is routine. Fingers splayed, I travel upwards to my stomach, and feel for either rumblings of hunger (success!) or absolutely nothing (bitch, what's wrong with you?!). Then to my sides. Grip my sides. I feel an hour glass and unused substance. And when I turn on to my side and try to sleep (- the left side, you'll digest faster!!!! Quothe the pro-ana) my knee joints clash together and I wonder if I'll be bruised in the morning.

You can imagine that I'm feeling very alone right now.

"event","So I'm sitting in a restaraunt called ""The Bubble Room."" The walls are dripping with pictures of pin-up girls and memorobelias from the 1930's. My mind is frantically trying to calculate how many calories were in the keish I ate for lunch, how much butter was used, if I everything on their menu is deep-fried or breaded and if it was, how I'd fake a stomach ache for the third time this week. My hands are cold. I'm fidgetting.

Then I decide, ""Fuck it,"" and I begin to eat, deciding that I had to try to get better, that I couldn't live my life as a psycho dedicated to her own wasting away. I even go as far to order dessert (oh yes, I did I did I did chocolate cake hahaha who's in control now bitch).

The metal of the fork cuts cleanly through what I'd normally KILL myself for having. Sugar, fat grams, oil, carbs, eggs, flour; my own personal version of hell. I take a few bites and for the first time manage to think, ""Hey, maybe I can do this. Maybe with practice, this gets easier."" It will all be okay, you know. I'll find a way to eat like a sensible human being, I'll live, I'll love, I'll eventually improve before my reproductive organs are shot so I can actually have a family of my own. I will be... normal?

That's when my mother spoke.

""Look at that MOUND of FAT."" She emphasized those words: MOUND. FAT. Her eyes scan me down like I've metamorphosized into a killer whale, and I want to cry but I'm not sure I remember how, though I recall it has something to do with water, so I take a sip. Fidget. Drop my fork. Look into the celluloid eyes of Betty Page to my right and try, honest to God, not to shake, because she's proven every little voice in my head right, that I am in fact disgusting.

146 lbs. and FAT, FAT, FAT!!!!

Wayne mumbles something about how he needs to loose some poundage and I make some arbitrary comment on how it's perfectly acceptable in today's society for a male to be slightly overweight. He doesn't even lift his head from the key lime pie before him as mom says, ""While you two are ingesting those MOUNTAINS of CALORIES, I'm going to have a cigarette.""

I slam my fork down again, something bubbling up inside me that I still can't describe, but I know that I've only felt this sort of conviction a few times before in my life. It's entwined with anger but not completely, it's more logical than that, more predictable. I glare at her, hissing out the words that I've been meaning to say for so long:

""Yes, mother. Let's encourage an eating disorder in someone who already has a tendency to self abuse!"" Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

Crust sticks to Wayne's lip and another slosh of the green mixture is heard as retorts, ""Oh, you're not going to get an eating disorder.""

....
I am speechless.
I have been ED-NOS since 7th grade.

""I already had one,"" I growl in response, my volume stamped out from my own shock that they'd forgotten so quickly.

Do they remember

 -when they caught me on my knees in the bathroom on the floor, trying to throw up a waffle but accidently clogging the toilet?
 -when I could hardly walk up the driveway because I had absolutely no energy after school, no energy to burn, no anything?
 -the dark circles under my eyes as I'd watch the scale numbers reflect back at me, them hovering over my shoulder, trying to see if my weight decreased as the weeks went by?
 -when I'd wear large sweatshirts all the time because THEY COULD SEE MY RIBS THROUGH MY SHIRT?!
 -the times I started crying at the kitchen table because being 5'10 and 110 pounds was just too fat?

Oh nah, I don't have an eating disorder.

Mom's eyes are unfeeling as she steps outside for a smoke, and I retreat to the bathroom where I throw up the cake I just ate, because I am a fat, greedy, selfish, ugly pig. While I stood in front of that restroom mirror - a horrible, bloated face staring back at me - I promised myself that I would eat as little food as possible, and that every scrap I can't avoid eating will be thrown up.

By don't be concerned, that'd be really quite silly. Wayne's a doctor, after all. And according to him, I simply won't GET an eating disorder, despite my history of self abuse and anorexia, not to mention my current relapse into a caustic world where hunger is the only way of knowing that you're actually alive, that gnawing feeling in your gut, that tumbling down the stairs as you black out from starvation or look at your nails and see a sickening, bruised shade of violet, that voice inside your head that screams everything would just get FUCKING better if you'd JUST STOP EATING, what's wrong with you, you ate yesterday, isn't that good enough?

I know that this entry was more grandiose than it needed to be, but I felt the need to format it this way... if you read it, leave a comment or something, it's been such a distressing night and I can't wait to get out of Florida and back in New Jersey."

"event","I have to wake up at about 8ish for my doctor's appointment tomorrrow (psychologist). Becca's coming along too, I believe, or at least I hope. Some strange things have been happening but since they don't involve just myself, I will not post them here.

About 500 calories today. Not bad, I guess. But then again, that depends on your definition of ""bad"". The average woman needs around 2,200 calories daily.

After almost two weeks of binging and purging, I gained weight and am up to 146 lbs. It's time to kick that habit in it's mother-fucking shins.

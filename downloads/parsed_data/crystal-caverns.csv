"event","If anyone wants a character that's not already taken just say so and I'll work parts of your personality into the character! :)
But remember alot of them have already appeared in the story so try not to pick one who's too far off from your personality, kay? ;)
Anyway..... I'll be posting the pictures of my characters on my group page whenever I get finished with them.... they'll be up in the artwork section of the photo albums. Here's the link....

Also anyone is welcome to join.... I'm the only member at the moment, but hey, it's kool! You can just use it to post your thoughts on spiritual issues and it's also a place to show off your artwork. 
Ja."

"event","So John wouldn't hang out with me tonight so instead I went to Clearwater Beach with Brent. He's a cool kid, very nice and easy going. John did call, however while we were there, and agreed to hang out with me tomorrow night. Now I just need to figure out what to do.....Beach sounds good, romantic sorta but do I want romance? I guess the better question would be does HE want romance... probably not. Dinner? Oh how I hate trying to decide. What makes things even harder is when I have absolutely NO idea of my surroundings. Tomorrow should be an interesting one..."

"event","I have to admit, working with 98 % of males is tough on a starry eyed little girl such as myself. There are some that I come across that I tend to find interesting, funny, nice, attractive, etc etc. Sometimes not all at once, sometimes all wrapped in a neat little bundle. I have mentioned Sean, whom I thought was that nice bundle and then some. Only time will tell on that one though. However, I have failed to mention another co worker of mine that can fall into several of the above mentioned categories at the same time. His name is John, and since he has been working here he has made quite the impression on me. He slightly resembles John Mayer, which is SO dreamy, and has such a nice warm smile that makes me melt every time he graces me with his presence. Lately I have been noticiing that we have shared similiar shifts, as well as similar lunch breaks, to which we had a hearty laugh and his explanation was that he was ""stalking"" me. The past week or so however, our schedules have differed and so when I saw him in all his dark haired, blue eyed beauty this afternoon I was ecstatic. He asked when I was going on break and when i told him 4 pm, he asked me out to lunch. Of course I agreed, and 4 oclock FINALLY came, and we ate and got to know each other a little. I found out he was 19, which just figures, since he looks about 22 or so. We get back to the store and start working in our seperate depts. again. I couldnt get him out of my mind, and the butterflies didnt seem to want to go away. Finally I mustered up enough guts to walk up to him adn ask him if he wanted to hang out later. His reacion ""Sure! what do you wanna do?"" hmmmm.. what DO i wanna do.. well i guess a better question would be what DONT i wanna do..... well either way i suggested renting a movie but he lived too far away so instead we saw a movie (Wedding crashers, good fucking movie, i strongly suggest all of you to see it). Upon arriving at the movie theater i get out of his car and notice a piece of paper in his back seat reading ""Holly Loves (written with a heart)John"" I read it aloud, and questioned ""Holly, is that your girlfriend?"" ""Yep"" he replied without a care. My heart sank. He started talking about her and telling me all these stories about how he doesnt like her and doesnt even know why he's wiht her etc etc.. I just wanted to blurt out ""Dump her for me!"" but i just couldnt or wouldnt. I did mention that it wasnt a good idea to be out with me, but he said it was fine. Right, its fine because we're just friends right? (scowls) Ugh. so once again, jessica, you tanked. good job. Although this one seems to have a light at the end of the tunnel. We had a great time, flirted a little, and agreed that we simply MUST do it again sometime. All in all, the night ended with a positive note, and if it werent for the piece of popcorn kernel lodged in the back of my throat, i mgiht be able to go to bed a happy gal for once. FOr now though, I am going to sit and wait for him to call me to let me know he made it home ok. Goodnight everyone."

"event","Ok so i am officially the worlds biggest asshole. I walk into work this morning feeling really down and out about this whole sean deal. THe first person I saw was Bill Davis, my favorite manager. The first thing he says to me is ""how is Sean doing?"" Of course, I did not know what he was talking about, and assumed he meant that since he called out Sunday then he must not be doing so well. Therefore, I said ""Uh, he's ok.. he's in Colorado though"". Bill said ""Yeah I know, didnt you hear what happened?"".......????? no?? ""His father passed away"". GASP. I think at that point the entire state of Florida heard my jaw drop to the floor and my hand slap over my gaping mouth. How could this have happened?? How can i be so selfish and think nothing but negative thoughts while he is going through this incredibly traumatic experience? I am such an idiot. HOwever there is that little part of me still saying ""damn, there go my chances""... I really suck."

"event","ok ok so relationships suck, they do, but hell, i still like some kind of companionship once in a while. what really sucks though is that for once in my life i FINALLY got something i wanted, and in the aftermath of it, there is total chaos and carnage. 
sean is someone i met at work. he is a beautiful baseball player and the second i saw him i knew i wanted him. we became friends and the more we hung out the more obvious it seemed that he had absolutely no interest whatsoever. i was just beginning to give up when last night we all hung out and played beer pong. sean, brad, francisco, bill and i all got pretty lit up, as we played about 10 rounds or so of pong, then a half assed round of fuck the dealer (of which i was the dealer for about ninety percent of the game) anyway bill got to be his usual self and walked out when sean and i started playing MVP. we argued and argued and by the time we went home i was so fired up that i did NOT want to go in the house with him. therefore i told him that i was leaving and to tell his parents that i fell asleep on the couch and he left me there. now lets rewind for a second back to when we left. i noticed sean had already gone to bed, so i went in and told him i was leaving etc etc. im not quite sure how it happened but we ended up kissing, (!!!) and at that point i really didnt want to leave. but i did anyway. so once we were home i called brad and had him come pick me up. sean was in the backseat holding my hand (awww) anyway we get back to sean's and yadda yadda yadda (hehehe) and the next morning bill texts me saying his mom was angry, but he told her the lie we made up, which makes no sense. so all hell breaks loose at home between him and his mom, and of course i came out looking like the bad guy (even though i really didnt do anything wrong). ugh. for once in my life there is a guy that i like who actually likes me (i hope) and yet nothing good is happening to follow that up. Bills upset, his parents are upset, and im upset that every one is upset! so now here i sit and await his parents to come home, and i am paranoid as hell as to what they will say."

"event","Why? well, why the hell not? Relationships suck. They tie you down and somehow that doesnt seem very appealing to me at all. I had a convo with a friend (who will remain nameless) the other night about relationships. He had been dating his girlfriend for almost 3 years now, and I just don't think the relationship will remain on ""cruise control"" for much longer. At some point there will be a fork in that road. One road leads him to marriage (eek) and the other to a timely and gruesome death of the relationship. He doesnt complain much about the relationship, which leads me to wonder which road he will eventually follow. The former scares me to death. Marriage?! That M word is certainly a scary one. WHy do people put so much pressure on it though? what has our society done to men and women that makes marriage such a sanctimonious occasion that it rips people apart just thinking about all the unconventional ways that two people can love each other. It sickens me. People put too much pressure and value on labels. ""this is my ______________"" (fill in with whichever title you want: boyfriend, girlfriend, wife, husband, fiancee, etc. etc.) Who ever says ""Hey mom, I'd like you to meet my fuck buddy"" or ""this is my friend-with-benefits"" or ""this is my lesbian lover"" i dunno.but then again, even all those people have titles, too don't they. damn. Nikki talked about marrying her boyfriend the other night, and all i could think of is that this poor girl is barely 23 years old and is already planning a SECOND wedding, and I havent even given the slightest thought to ever even GETTING married in my life. That M word is too much for me. Just put me in the ""etc."" column when it comes to relationships, thank you very much."

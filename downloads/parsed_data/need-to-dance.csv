"event","So today was graduation and everyone in our building pretty much left :( Pretty sad if you think about it cause I didn't even get to say goodbye to a lot of them...stupid being hung over from last night's fun and games ;) Note to self: dont drink the night before graduation next year.  But I got to see Brian's family today which was good! I miss not being able to see them more...if only i had a car - i hate the fact that he has to drive down here every time we want to see eachother for may semester especially when he has to work full time so its kind of hectic.  I'm hoping i'll get to see his family at least one more time before may semester's up.  They're the nicest people and make me feel so welcome in their own house - i love the fact that i know them and love them all!! But tomorrow's when move-out day is for may semester people...wonder how long it will take and if i'll actually get a single or not cause that would definitely be nice! I have no idea when Brian will be able to come down around his work schedule and everything but I know we can work it out! But like I said the seniors left today except for the two next door and I miss them already especially my suitemates and the boy.  I wish i could give him a huge hug right now - i think i got way too used to having him just downstairs for the whole year! But i'm lucky enough for that so its okay - wish i could tell what was going to happen this summer - like i know ill come up and he'll come down but gas is gonna be really high and we'll both have different schedules for work and whatnot - but we managed last year so im not worried :) I love him so much so anytime we can get to spend together will totally be worth it! I know he drinks too much sometimes and needs to quit smoking but besides that I love him! I'm so glad i got to meet him last year and that things worked out thanks to his persistence ;) Cause hes a great guy and even tho he had to take some time apart from me to think about us and where it was gonna be going from here i'm glad he made the choice he did! I dont want to think about where Id be right now if something different had happened! But this summer will be great! Everyone will be 21 and hopefully i can get another job besides the bakery to afford my bad habits...ie shopping and soon to be a legal drinker lol ;) Can't wait for the fun to start!! :-D"

"event","Okay so im depressed again...yea i know it sucks....i feel like all i ever do is sleep away the days im not in classes just so i don't have to face what's really in my heart. I gave him time to think about the whole thing so im waiting...patiently...but i cant wait forever and he knows that...so why does it feel like each day is a month. I really love him, i dont want to let him go. But i think he already has...or is trying to just so he wont hurt me in the long run...i can't picture being without him and its just hurting me more to sit and think about it. Especially since Valentines Day is next week and yet again another day of being upset to come...great... I want to be with him and he knows that...he just needs to make up his mind...thats the hard part...me waiting and him thinking. Every minute i just want to be with him when i know i cant and when i try to avoid it it just comes back at me and makes me cry at random times and now i feel like the only time im happy...like honestly happy is when im drinking..and even thats not a safe bet - so i guess ill sit here with the pain that i have and wait some more because its all i really can do without hurting as much as i could be..."

"event","Okay so its the second week back to school and i'm already slightly stressing and getting aggravated. Granted 5 classes all at once isn't gonna be the easiest thing in the world but there are people that are bugging the heck out of me...one in particular! Don't you hate when there are types of people that just make u want to stay in your room all day just to avoid them. It's those clingy people that u finally tell them that you need some space and then they cluelessy ask...""is it anything i did?"" umm yea i'd say so, sorry im not usually this pessimistic but this is ridiculous - i've only been back to school, this will be my second week...okay well im gonna stop complaining for a bit cause it usually doesn't help...but it's snowing today which is good cause well it is January! And i'm hopin it doesnt stop til sometime tomorrow so i have a class or two cancelled lol ok well thats it for today! later!"

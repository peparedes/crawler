"event","I went to a really great lecture on Thursday night called ""...But Some of my Best Friends are Black"" by a white social justice advocate, Tim Wise. While most of the things he said did not come as revelations to me, he is a very good speaker, and made a lot of connections that had not been articulated for me before. 

One of the things that has stuck with me the most were his statements regarding diversity and college admissions. The lecture was at Amherst College, which is just as expensive as Hampshire, but has a decidedly more affluent feel to it. Wise stated that, because the SAT is so skewed and students of color perform much worse on it than white students, schools have to stop caring so much about SAT scores. Besides, the SAT does not indicate a students future performance or likelihood to graduate. But the reason schools continue to place so much importance on the SAT is because it affects the US News and World Report college rankings. And when a college ranks highly, their loans go down, applications go up- basically, they make more money. Amherst is often ranked as the number one liberal arts college in America, and it has an endowment of $1 billion. So even though the school may claim to be committed to diversity in admissions, without offering additional support to students of color or changing admissions policies to compensate for the instituitonal racism that exists in high schools and the SAT, they will never be able to truly attain diversity. 

To me, this means that, pretty much, we will never be able to truly eradicte racism in a capitalist society. A school would have to actually stop caring about money to create a diverse community. And even though most colleges are not for-profit institutions, there is always a bottom line. Ask anyone at the Hampshire College business office...

This struck me not because some macho nu-metal frontman or tough guy rapper was singing about shooting a load or how the hot girls make him come. No, there are actually two pop songs out right now with men singing about making women come. Really! But you'd never know it from MTV. I only figured it out because the songs were on the radio, and even ClearChannel doesn't care about a little come. First of all there is Outkast's Hey Ya!, which includes the lyric ""don't wanna meet your daddy, just want you in my caddy/don't wanna meet your mamma, just wanna make you come-a."" Then there is ""This Love"" by Maroon 5, an awfully poppy song about a break up. The singer says ""I tried my best to feed her appetite/ keep her coming every night/ so hard to keep her satisfied."" It's so rare in american pop culture that we hear men declare how much they want to make women sexually satisfied. While female pop stars may sing about their own pleasure, it's often in guarded  or ambiguous language (see: Kelis's ""Milkshake""). Men get to sing about objectifying women all the time, and use female bodies constantly to sell their music, in videos and print material. Yet, neither of the videos for Hey Ya! or This Love are particularly objectifying- while they do include traditionally sexy women, they aren't pole dancing in bikinis, like so much of MTV. It goes hand in hand with the message of the song- because these men actually care about a woman's satisfaction, they don't objectify them to the lowly status most music video girls recieve. Both of these examples are small parts of the song, and only appear once. But MTV muting them out makes a larger point than just letting it go. They are, in effect, saying that while it is ok for men to objectify us and use us for their own sexual pleasure, we shouldn't expect to get anything out of it ourselves."

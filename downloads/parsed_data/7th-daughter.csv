"event","The airport was pretty much deserted, except for the flight crew and passengers that were on-board. I found my way to the baggage claim area, waiting a few moments watching the conveyor move slowly in a circle before the first pieces of luggage appeared on it. Finally spotting mine, reaching for the handle of one bag as it moved along on the conveyor nearer to me, snatching the handle I pulled it off then reached for my second bag, pulling it easily off the circular moving conveyor. Having collected my bags I followed the small group that had begun moving down the long corridor leading to the streets of LA.

It was easy to get a cab, even at this hour of the morning when darkness still filled the sky, daylight still being a few hours off. After the driver placed my baggage into the trunk of the cab I settled into the back seat. Willow had not given me directions to the hotel or the address so all I had was the name of the place. After telling the driver the hotel which I wished to be taken to, he seemed to know the one I mentioned, the cab pulled from the curb moving easily along the streets.

The driver finally eased the cab up to the curb outside a building which I was assuming was the Hyperion. After my things had been taken from the trunk of the cab I paid the man his fare, which he took eagerly before returning to the vehicle and taking off down the street.

Turning slowly to face the building I saw the sign which let me know I was indeed at the right hotel. Gripping the handles of my bags, one now held in each hand, I lifted them as I took that first step toward the doors of the hotel wondering if this Angel Willow mentioned was there or if I would just simply get a room for myself and wait for Willow, Rupert and the others to arrive."

"event","After disembarking the plane with the strap of my small carry on held lightly within the grasp of my fingers I headed toward the baggage claim area. I stood for I don't know how long before I saw my luggage appear on the conveyor belt. I eased the strap of my carry on on my shoulder as my other luggage drew slowly closer, once within my reach I grabbed the handle of one of my suitcases, pulling it off the conveyor, setting it down at my feet before reaching for the other, I snatched the handle just before it would have moved out of my reach. Having possession of the two pieces of luggage I started from the baggage claim area, following the signs that would take me out of the airport.

Once outside I found it easy to get a taxi as there were quite a few lining the curb outside the airport. After my luggage was loaded into the trunk of the vehicle I climbed into the cab giving the driver the address of where I wished to be taken, I settled back and looked out the window taking in the scenery as the taxi moved at a steady rate down one street to the next.

The driver finally pulled to a stop outside a bookstore, Mystique's Reading Place, and got out to retrieve my bags from the trunk. I slowly exited the taxi and stood a moment looking at the building. After the driver placed the bags down near me I fished out a few bills from my pants pocket, giving the crumpled bills to the man who thanked me with a nod of his head before returning to his cab and in no time he had taken off down the street, most likely headed toward his next fare.

As I eased the door to the shop open the bell that hung above it gave a little ring as I stepped inside. Just as I set down my bags I saw a woman emerge from the back room of the bookstore.

""You must be Maida."" the woman said, speaking with a slight English accent.

""Yes,"" was the single word response I gave in return with a smile of my own given.

""I'm Mystique. When Agatha informed me that one of the coven was coming and would need a place to stay for a few days I was more then happy to offer a place for you to stay. I am sure you must be tired from the long plane ride. I'll show you which room you will be using during your stay,"" Mystique reached for one of my bags, lifting it up she then headed toward the back of the store, taking up the other, my carry on bag still hung from my shoulder as I followed Mystique to the back, then up the stairs to where I would be staying for a short time."

"event","<i>""The battle has ended."" I turned from the window of my room I had been looking out of to the voice that brought me from my thoughts.

""And those that survived?"" I asked Agatha who stood now within the doorway of my room.

""There were some casualties, but in battle there always is, Maida,"" Agatha said, pausing a moment before continuing. ""He did survive, along with Willow,"" a smile now crept slowly across Agatha's features.

I smile back to her, feeling a rush of relief wash over me. I had feared he would have died in the battle that had been brought to the city of Sunnydale and prayed every eve to the Goddess to see him through it.

""Do you have all you need, Maida?"" Agatha asked after glancing to my bags beside my bed that I had packed earlier.

""Yes."" I responded softly. I had been told a few days prior that I was being sent to the States, to a city called Cleveland. Of course I was nervous about going there, this would be the first time I would be leaving the only home I had known, being to a place where I knew not a soul. I was assured that the survivors of the battle with the First would eventually find their way there, but the elders of the coven were vague, they always were due to the fact that they did not want to change the destiny of any living soul, which is why I was kept a secret from the one who was my father, too many lives would have been changed had he found out the truth.

""Maida."" Agatha said as she stepped closer to me, I could see now that she held something in her hand, a small, velvet pouch. 

""Keep this with you always."" she continued as she removed an amulet attached to a silver chain from the black, velvet pouch. ""It protects the wearer from harm."" I heard her sat as she placed the amulet around my neck.</i>

I turned from the small window of the plane I had been looking out of, having gotten caught up in my thoughts, looking now to the flight attendant who had tapped me on the shoulder to get my attention.

""We will be landing soon, Miss, and you will need to fasten your safety belt."" she stated, moving on only after I complied.

I glanced down to the amulet I had been absentmindedly fingering, one side was inscribed with words of Latin, the other had a pentacle, an upright pentagram surrounded by a circle engraved into it. I could not help but think of what might be waiting for me in the city of Cleveland, that had never been divulged to me, I was only told I would be needed there."

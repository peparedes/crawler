I get over him..then i just fall straight back into this trap.  I hate school, i cant stand walking up and down the hall ways seeing them together..it hurts soo bad, but i dunno if its good or not, but im soo good at saying everything is okay, when really i'm in pieces.  I dont know where to go, i dont know whom i can talk to. i know i got ash and stace, and everyone else out there..but u know that one special friend wher eu can tell anything to, u can cry to and not feel stupid or retarded..yea well that friend was brian. i dont even know what i can or cannot tell him. i just hate watching the person i love, like someone else. i hate knowing everything i worked hard for, the only thing in my life where i made an effort and go beyond limits for is now gone.  i see the pictures, i read the notes, i listen to the music..and each and every time it hurts. people in school see me fine see me act like everything is okay..but they see that cuz i want them to see that, but really i'm crying out for help, i'm really lost, i dont know what to do. for once in my life, i'm by myself and really dont know what to do.  Everyone says it takes time..well this is going to take a long time, cuz i'm never going to get used to this.  My bestfriend broke me..now who to trust?

i also hate being the person i'm becoming, holding everything inside, not knowing what to do, not being happy, living life like its a terrible thing.   i want to go back to what i was, happy, joyful, no worries, eating full meals, getting the full 12 hours of sleep (haha), but most of all, not dreding to go to school, and not being afraid to walk up and down the hallways  :(  

and another piece of info..when u ask me how i'm doing and i say i'm fine.. 98% of me is really saying.. im awful.."

"event","yea...not in the best mood at all, i dunon which is worse, being upset bout this situation or being soo pissed off. a friend is never supposed to hurt you..ur supposed to be able to trust them more than a guy right?? then why is my own good friend asking me if she should date my EX (who i've dated for a year and who i still love) or not, but yet not lead him on. i'm fucked either way. a friend wouldn't even put there other friend in that situation especially if she says our friendship is more important than some guy.  Sometimes i wish i were invisible and i could live life without being hurt, or without worrying about things. People say oh just waite cuz that one guy will come along..well i though brian was that one guy..but guess what i got fucked like usual, and i guess i'm supposed to waite for the next guy, but i cant. every guy reminds me of him and i hate going to school cuz i cant even be around them cuz i make her feel uncomfortable. but what about me huh? last year that's all i did, was try to satisfy everyone else..and put myself last..and that got me nowhere that got me depressed and i dont watn to go back there. i'm soo pissed cuz i hate being here..whatever happened to HS being our best years huh??

that was from my xanga..but i guess i'll add more cuz i like Livejournal better ;)

but i'm just soo frusterated..cuz everything i worked hard for, for the past year to make my relationship with brian sooo strong was fuckin waisted..there was no point.  People say..oh there will be another guy..but no one is like brian. and yea i knwo i need to get over him, and u know i have, but it still hurts seeing him smile when  he's with my friend.  What the hell am i supposed to do. i'm soo good on having and making other people happy, but what about myself.. I'm tired of putting myself last, i'm tired of finding someone i really like, and just getting heart broken all over again..maybe i should turn lesbian.. haha just kidding!!! no lezbo action from me !! (sorry guys) but yea anywas..i'm just sick and tired of being hurt from guys..for once i'm afraid of a relationship. i'm afraid of loving someone or liking someone now.. how sad is that..what one guy can do.. pathetic huh"

"event","well i wwas mentions before how everyone has too much free time to write such a long entry but now it is my turn, to sit down and actually put my thoughts in order.

First off i'm sure all of you have learned now that Brian and I broke up, and just because we walk together sometimes in the morning doesn't mean we r dating, it means we're trying our best to be friends.  yes i know about Amy and what is going on.  All i have to say is that, yes i still love him and i always will. he became my bestfriend, he was the first to really know everything about me and he was the first to actually know me for me.  i never had that feeling before.  but as one year rolled along i didnt prepare myself for what usually happens..he gets scared.  I thought after soo long he wouldn't be afraid of commitment, but that wasn't the case. He thought about it and just wanted to be friend so when he goes to college i'll be used to not having and not depending on him, yea its a good idea, but what comes after it i never saw it coming. He decided to tell me that he really likes one of my good friends, and he asks for my permission..but why ask my permission when we all know ur going to do whatever u want whether or not u have permission too.  So with that beign said, i know i dont want to lose him as a good friend, i'd rather see him happy with someone else than always be down because of me. So i decided to help him, but at the same time looking after my friend. after many sleepless nights and non appatite days.. i realized why am i worrying about this, all i have to worry about is losing my friends. i dont need to worry about giving them permission, because i know they r going to do whatevery they want. if they choose to date, i cant gurantee i'll be close to them as i once was, but i know they will be happy so that will make me alittle happier.
   but since then i've moved on..not in a hurry or anything, but just knowing brian likes someone else forces me to move on and i guess that's waht i need right now, i cant just be here waiting for him. he's going to college in a few months and i cant be dependent like him like he said. i hate to admit it, but he is right every once n awhile and he does care about me. yea the past couple days have been hard cuz i dont talk i dont feel comfortable i already feeel myself driffting away, but theres nothing i can do but just try to be there when he needs me. I know for a face that i will always love him, and that i will never forget him. people didnt see the side i saw.  but i know he's never going to read this cuz one its too long for him to read and 2, he cant look at my profile cuz he's on AOL.  but who knows if he should even read this, i mean.. is it really worth it. is it worth my time writing about him in here? i dunno but i guess that's what these things r for.
  There's a secret that i'm letting out to everyone here: i will always love brian, and no one could ever take the spot he has in my heart, but what i can say to all the guys or whatever, just give me time and i'll get over all of this. Time heals everything. and another secret, that year that i spent with him, wasn't the best/easiest year for me, and he was by me all the way, he supported me, and was there when i needed to talk to someone. i hope he knows that i will always want him, and that i will always love him, but i whether i have the courage to tell him or not..who knows so maybe he will never know :/ nothing i can do though.

Besides all of that, past couple days have been really hard, but i've pulled myself together and i'm proud that i can deal with the fact that i am alone right now, and that i dont have a bf. its something that i never thought would happen cuz i thought brian and i would last alittle bit longer, but hey, every relationships have there turning point.  Whether amy and brian date each other isn't up to me, its up to her basically i guess brian says he'll deal with it, but i knwo he wont give up without a fight. i've learned to accept the fact that i'm not his #1 anymore, and that i wont get calls from him everyday, and that i'm only a friend.  there's nothing i can do about that but support him. people get pissed at me because i help him with things and that i'm so nice to him, but that's how i am: i cant be mean to people, especially a person who i have loved for a full year and who i will always, and a person who was my first bestfriend, a person who really knew me, a person who would always listen and be there if i needed someone.  That's what a true friend is.. a person u can go to about anything, a person where u can be urself and cry on there shoulder, i was blessed to have that in him. but that's gone now, he says he's till there if he ever needs anyone, but its just not the same.
  I've been dealing with this pretty well, even though everything has happened so fast one day i have a bf the next i dont have anyone and he likes someone else. lifes tough, but all we can do is live in it. I just want to thank all my girls who have supported me thru all of this, thanks for listening to me whine and complain to how its not fair, thanks for bairing with me. with out u..i would still be at night one crying at everything that reminds me of him. one step at a time and i'll be on my way, but always one step back cuz i will always love him..."

First off me n bri are great soooo stoked for thrusday cuz its our one year!! yay, seems totally much longer than that, but... time goes by when you having fun!! haha i'm such a loser, i'm just goin on and on with no point getting across.  but me and brian are soo strong we're like this  > X haha no.. we're just really good friends, he's my bestfriend and i think i'm his..not sure though. but anyways.. nothing exciting has happend in my life 2 game in a row i scored a goal, so thats pretty cool since i play defence. o and if u i see number 8 who is on the VHHS soccer sunday league team, i'm goin to kick her ass trying to act like she's all touch cuz i'm better than her, freakin bitch! ahh lol, she doesn't even go to my school, she goes to freakin A stevenson (no offence some people there r okay LIKE NICOLE! and others..well they scare me). i've read like 3 people Xanga's or LJ and they r soo long!! i mean seriously..who has the time to right all that, some of them r HUGE!!!!!! like i think this is one of my longest! and it isn't even that long!!!
but on the subject with my brother and ashley..yes i'm stuck in the middle, and  yes everyone should think i should take greg's side but i have heard ashley's side too..so i just stay out of it and hear both sides..and most likely i will still stay in the middle cuz ashley's COOOLLLL!! yea thats right COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL haha 1 c and millions 0's and zillions L's haha okay im done my mom is having people over..and im being shoved to watch my dog and ""study"" ahah but upstairs is comcast TV..now..honestly who will study. i not!! hehe n then i fail :( bummer again maybe maybe i'll do niether and sleep! oo there's an opportunity!! mwhaha okay im gone, adios!! and if u really did read this leave a comment so i know if im at least talking to someone (kinda)"

"event","""it all comes down to this.."" well the past year was a roller coaster let me tell you that.  i met the best person in my life and i lost a great person at the same time.  People same to go on what other people think, if someone says that outfit is ugly, that person will never wear it again...since when did people care what other people think? it's not like they will determine everything forever. but anyways.. my deep thoughts were disturbed so i'm kinda off track now. 
oh yes, break. well right off the bat i went to Florida which was nice relaxing some alone time to get thoughts in the right order. and got to spend time with my family.  i missed my baby though, but i guess its just a taste of how i will feel when he's gone for a year, but maybe, just maybe he'll come back (I hope so cuz i'm stuck here in this boring town) man Junior year will be a drag now that i think bout it..damn nothing to look forward to every morning.. :/ bummer.  Isn't Florida supposed to have nice weather?? well of course when i was down there it rained all day on Christmas and it had freezing warning in the evening.. oh boy what the warm destinations are coming to. it snowed in TEXAS for cryin out loud!! goodness gracious.
New years- i think taht was the best new years ever being with my baby, watchin movies till the late hours. waking up in the afternoon and trying to wake him up. everything seemed to fit, everything seemed to be too perfect or a dream.  thanks baby! you say the things that mean the world and mean them with all your heart. i couldn't ask for anything more, thanks for being there, thanks for supportin me and cheering me up when i'm down or mad, thanks for your support thanks for everything. but most of all, thanks for taking the time to get to know me and who i really am, i cant get past with anything with out u knowing something is going on. thanks for being my bestfriend, i love you.
But with all of that behinde us and living that as a memory now, the weekend has passed and we must go on. School is starting and you will go back to the same routine; seeing the same people in the halls, sitting in the same desk, sitting in the same class.  New years and Christmas and break will all go down as a memory. I hoped all of you lived it to the fullest cuz you cant go back in time and redo things. i know i wouldn't go back and change anything, everything was perfect. i couldn't ask for more. I love you Brian, and i hope to everyone else that there break was fun"

"event","so..the time has come where i have stepped out of the box, and sat down at another one to reveal my thoughts to all u wonderful people. *adjusts to a comfortable position*

Things really have not changed that much, i'm driving more often now, and the highest speed i have gone is bout 80 driving up to Kenosha to see my lovely brother. College life seems to be fun, get to live in a different atmosphere u have never expierenced and geet to meet new people. thats always a plus in life..right? other than that, soccer has been goin pretty well..taking up alot of my time and making me really tired majority of the days out of the week. I've also come to realize that friends seem to stand out more than others. its easier to tell who u can really count on then others. you can see the same people day after day, its the ones who stand out more. the ones u can tell anything to, the ones who can tell something is wrong through text messages, or over the phone, or when u dont even see that person.  Many people dont get to expierence such a feeling. but when u come across it there's not a greater feeling. some people may look at it as a bad thing, that someone knows so much about you, they know ur weakness, but would u rather have someone who really cares and knows, then have no one and be alone? na..didnt think so. its always good to have company when ur at a down time. Other than that..things are flyin by pretty well...till next time"

"event","so...last night was HC..yea the dance was pretty dumb, but i got to see all my friends all pretty, and i got to do my nails and hair so it was all good. but let me start from the veerrry beginning: 
Friday-School,did my nails with yule, and brooke, then went to brians house. stayed there till 11, and we watched a movie and had some pizza! it was all gooooooodd.
Satuday aka Hectic and Last min. day AND HOMECOMING DAY!- woke up early took a shower, went to get my hair done..two hours worth of time to hair..::sigh:: then right after that had some food and went to get my manicure..then right after that walked to Smoothie on Over THEN! brian picked me up. went to woodfield to meet up with his sister and mom and bought a tie for him. staright from Woodfield we drove back to Vernon HIlls and ate dinner at Ruby Tuesday's in the mall.. (where i embarassed myself..heh). then right after that rushed to get to my house by 7 (which we were 1/2 an hour late) then we rushed to get ready and his sis and mom were there waiting to take pictures. right after pictures we left to the dance. we left Eary from the dance to Blockbuster, then after decided to what movie we want (20 min later..) we went back to my house to watch it. AFTER the movie was over (when i woke up..heheh) we turned the movie off, said goodnight to my mom then fell asleep. (around 1:30 in the morning)
SUNDAY!- woke up early once again for a soccer game..after we drove to my soccer game, we won the game, and when we drove back, we went to McDonalds whwere brian had 3 double cheese burgers and i had a medium fries. After McDonals we drove back to the house, and once we got home i changed and brian got all his stuff..put all of it in the car and we went to the mall for like an hour and he got some stuff.. After the mall..im here exhausted...

Overall..-this weekend has been the best. i couldn't ask for anything more then spending time with my bestfriend all weekend. i had a blast babe! and we didnt even get tired of each other! lol!! i love you and thanks for the best weekend!! (even though both of us thought the dance was pretty dumb..::sigh:: lol o well!!) now..im of to see if i have anymore i have to do..(after a short nap ;)"

"event","hey, well after driving home from my soccer game, i was soo stressed out knowing that half the team hates each other. Me and Yule r captains now (voted by the team) and we a crap load of work to do. we were planning on having the team over at someones house for a movie night, and then have like ice cream so we have a bonding moment or something like that. Hopefully it will work, cuz today..it was sooo bad. Sarah N. quit the team, but that's her own fault cuz no one respected her on the field becuse she didnt shop up for practices (AT ALL) then assumed she would play the whole game and start..its not fair to the other players who work there butt off to earn there position. not only does she not come to prac. i dont think we have ever had our WHOLE team at a prac. i mena like..somebody will always show up late..or someone will always have to leave early (besides Natasha she has a good reason cuz of Drivers Ed.)  but me and Yule have a big problem to solve..but i guess we can handle it. 
To a different subj. i finally know where i'm going to eat dinner on Sat. me and bri r goin to Journey's End (they have good pizza) its the only place where i new that brian liked for sure..lol i mean like who doesn't like pizza?? only weird people dont.
To another subject once again.. Rachel..look i have heard from alot of people that u spreaded it. and i know from the past that u lie bout some things, thats why i dont 100% believe you. but just to set things straight, i didnt do jack crap with brian..espeically something like that. in my opinion its retarded to do something like that. but look, we have our different opinions on this topic, and we are intitled to our own opinion. if u say u didnt spread it or start it..then whatever. i dont care anymore..people will believe what they to believe, you cant change what they think. but i know i didnt, and that's all that is important to me. but sorry i yelled at u so much, it was just that i was having such a bad day and every little thing pissed me off.."

But besides all that funny crap, HS has been a blast..its soo much easier and more fun this year, prob cuz im not a stupid little fresh. anymore WOOHOO! haha.

as the tears seem to attack.
The pictures seem to over come me,
Knowing you're the only person i see.

I look down the halls,
Only waiting to see your face.
I cant waite till you hold me in your arms,
just the fact when i wake up to an alarm.

I tend to mistake reality for dreams,
And i tend to be mean.
But its only cause i love you and i care,
and leaving you, is something i dont dare.

i just ask myself why, when all the shit you put me through.
All the nights i cried over you,
i just asked myself, was it really true?

I know you really cared inside,
even though sometimes my tears rised.
You said u would always be there for me,
and with all the shit that has happend you always set me free.

You have devloped into my bestfriend,
and i dont know what i will do when ur gone to some far land.
You can always make me smile, yet always make me frown,
i just dont know what to do, cause where ever i go I see u in my head, and my frown turns around.

I dont know if i should still care,
even though when i talk to you, i'm always aware.
I've given up on what people think,
because half of them drink.

All i know is that you have made me soo happy,
and just thinking that i'm letting you go scares me.
Not only may I lose my bestfriend, but the one kid who introducded me to a feeling i never felt before.

i love you, and no one will and can ever change that. I promise..
I just dont have the heart to go on.. I'm sorry"

Latest Poem:
As the true confessions seem to spread.
The words i once heard are now dead.
Let go of the old memories,
is the only remedy.

Only i can decide when to close the door,
Where i'm not afraid to want more.
Standing up for once,
Not letting anyone take the chances i once had.

Let the risks come and get me,
cause i'm ready for the challenge to where i might be set free.
Not letting anyone or anything get in my way,
because here within me, i will stay.

I've put my gear on for this whindy road,
ready to take the super over load.
Not afraid of taking the fear on, one by one.
Because this time, there is only so far i can run."

The past couple days have been long and have been draggin one,but thats probably because School has started. But the past couple days have been pretty fun too. i got to hang out with my best friend, and had a really fun time. Yesterday, Jennifer,Kerstin,Nancy,Ann,Sherry, my mom and I all visited each other. but before that, i had a soccer scrimmage, no one tried at all, yet my mom says we play really well together.lol sure..we all played like shit,its simple. but we won that game 2-0. So even though it didnt count, it was still a good way to start off the season. But after the scrimmage, Jen and her mom came at the end of the game. Of course we were goin to leave straight to chicago from there. now remember im all sweaty and gross, and stinky. and what do they want me to do? TAKE NO SHOWER< AND GET DRESSED SO WE CAN GO! i was like WHAT! r u kidding me!. but no they were so i had to compromise and got dressed in different clothes put deoderant on and so fourth (not like u really need the detail in all). Then Nancy and Ann came and we took 2 cars to Chicago. As tired as i was after the game I WAS even more EXHAUSTED when i got home (alot later..) then we met Sherry at the Art Institute, and had lunch there. i swear in every dish they had (the menu wasnt that big) there was somethin i didnt like, NOT EVEN A REGULAR CEASOR SALAD! WHATS UP WITH THAT! so i kept on scrolling, and found a burger. so i wa slike yay! until i relaized it was 1/2 a pound! i was like what the hell do they think im an elephant! so then once we got the meal i ate my burger and realized it was really pink instead, and i was like whatever i'll eat it, but they all the women noticed it and called the waiter to get another one. (ookay i wasnt even that hungy when i got the burger now i have to start all over again? at least the fries were good :) )so then i got the burger back, and i was soooo full! so i ate half of it..then after that we walked even more in Downtown Chicago, i wont lie it was really alot of fun, but my legs were killing me!! then Nancy and Sherry left, so it was just my mom,Kerstin,Jen,n me left. we stopped back at Lake Forest to get there car, and we drove back to my house. then we decided to go to Gurnee Millss (whoopie more walking) but hey i got new clothes. then finally we got home at like 8:30, i think i seriously didnt stop walking for like 12 hours! IT CAN REALLY KILL YA! haha so..yea today i woke up and i can barley move, my legs KILL! not as bad as last night, so i cant complain to much. i slept like a baby though! so TODAY! ( i know alot can happen in one day, like yesterday as an example) WE have company coming over, so i guess its okay, they r all adults which means im goin to be bored out of my mind (one again) and i still need to do my homeowkr..maybe i should do that while i stil have an hour left huh? na..i have SH 2nd period! lol so i can do that there, but yea this is getting long, talk to u later!

everything will come to mind.
You think bout the past, and a tear may rise.

You cant stop your life, and live in that one time frame.
Just like you cant point a finger at someone and blame.
You have to take responsiblites for your own actions,
But yet be aware of your own reactions.

You can only hide so long,
but you will be eventually be drawn.
You'll be drawn to someone or something weather you like it or not.
A lesson learned is that you cant run away from yourself no matter how hard you try.

(pretty depressing huh!?) But as we all grow one day older after every 24 hours, individually we grow within ourselves, we realize that we now have to live every second, dont let a moment go by, and then think back and wish you did something else. if you could go back in time, im sure at least everyone would once. we all have regrets one day or another, but if you are smart enough, you will learn how to live every moment, and do all that you can do in that moment, and then live with out regrets. but with regrets there is always opportunity, u can either stay on the same road, play it safe and have more 'what if's"" BUT! if u change that one thing and turn..and take a different you will expierence a whole new you. i dont know where i'm getting all of this stuff, but listening to music and being soo relaxed..i just let my brain spill into my fingers on the keyboard. but as i come to realize that sometimes i just need sometime to myself, and think bout things, and realize that as an individual we need to learn how to cope within ourselves before we try to impress or try to get that guy. but every time i do think to myself, he always comes to mine, i try my hardest, but everything reminds me of him and it drives me insane. if i could just one day, start my life over and at a fresh start, i would do things differently, maybe this is why im soo concerned not to have regrets inlife, because life is too short to be upset bout something or to cry bout someone for hours, or to be pissed bout somethin silly.   but i guess im really writing this to explain my feelings, to let me finally let go. this journal  has helped me express my feelings in soo many ways. like now.. i come to really know what it feels like to have someone who really cares, and someone who will lend a ear, or shoulder to cry on. i never really new what it was like to have such a person. and because i have that person, it makes me even more of my surroundings and what i say, because it makes me not want to lose him anymore. but yea...my confession is over...goodnite"

"event","watching the olympics watching the USA win many gold medals and hearing our national anthem. makes me realize wish that i could do that. makes me wish i could one day represent my country. i know it will never happen, but it is my fantasy..one of the wildest dreams. everyone has 'em, some people dream bout goin into space (used to, but gave up..) i want to excel my skills so much in soccer to one day be on the team. but i know theres such a low chance of me doin it, so instead of making a fool out of myself by saying this i'll move on to a different topic.
hm..last night i accompished something... i took off a poster on my door, and reorganized everything, so now my door actually looks cool. this process took me bout 2 hours..just sitting there staring at things that ididnt now where to put. hahah proves i have no life right! yea..i know but ooo well. 
Today on the other hand.. i did nothing woke up at like 1, ate breakfest,watched the olympics, ordered pizza, and then went off to soccer. my goal is slowly being reached.. my six pack..currently i have a 4 pack, and im overwhelmed by that. i dont know the most thing i am soo concerned bout on my body is my stomach. i dont care bout my boobs, legs.. and stuff like that i care that i have a flat stomach with some abs! so..its gradually comin along. i really have nothing to say in here. o yea i finally washed my practice uniform that i havent watched in 2 weeks..haha what! it didnt smell so why wash! i wasnt goin to wash it this week..but my mom made me :/
i really do need friends to do something with me at night, cause it seriously looks like minnat is right..that i'm always home.. so im goin to try to make plans for tomorrow! later!"

"event","omg..my life was goin down the drain for alittle bit. Everything was fine, no drama.. well not really that much, but everything was fine. i enjoyed life, but then i started talkin to my ex. things started to get bad, i started to cry at night again. i would look at his picture and cry, i would hear songs that would reminde me of him and i would cry. whatever reminded me of him in the littlest way..i got alittle down. yea i still think of him, but nothing more as a friend now, he killed it by rambling on how he loves this other girl. i dont understand how he can do that and think i'm okay with that. does he not think i care bout him anymore? well i dont care what he thinks anymore, because i met a kid who is unbelievable. he has made my life so much better than it was before. instead of tears goin down my cheaks at night, i fall asleep smiling and with the fun times i had with him. hes such a great kid to be around, always can make me laugh, not afraid of being himself, cares, sweet. you cant even compare him to brian, cause he is just that good. Thank you soo much, i cant thank you enough on how you made my life change. i gave up on boys i didnt think i would get over brian, but then i met you. ever since i met you i always had a thing for you. you seemed like such a sweet kid. i'm still alittle hesitant bout us maybe datin, cause i'm still not 100% sure if you're over Alison, but thats just another card in life that you have to play. You dont know how you made my life seem better than it was before, just having you around and bein by you, makes everything perfect. thank you so much, and one of these days i'll pay you back. and try to give you the happyness that you gave to me. thanks babe, ur amazing, dont change...."

"event","a recap of today/yesterday. i went to BD's with Meghan..that place isnt that bad. but as my thoughts go..i'm helpin out my friend with some problems, the same problems i faced the other night. of course i still like brian..like i said before the sparks will always exsit, because he was such an amazing person. yea yea yea i know all you people dont believe it and all think im bullshitting. but you know what i'm not afraid to stand in what i believe in. Brian was an important person in my life, and i will always care for him. i will always love him too..he made me feel such a feeling that was greater than all the feelings. he was there when i needed tot alkt o some one, i could seriously talk to him bout anything because he did listen, it may seem like he isnt but truley he is. he's the only person to take my tears and seriously make them stop. i can be sobbing and i'll talk to him and i'll start to laugh/smile/and cry because im happy. i love you brian and i still miss you..."

"event","So i got ditched by two people today..haha that makes me feel all specail inside and make me feel loved even more! ha..right.. man.. what friends i have huh. i think im goin to do it this way..if you people want to hang out with me, then call my cell, cause i'm sick and tired of people forgetting to call me back, or them saying they cant. I'm tired of waiting for a call, when all ur goin to say is..i cant hang out. To a more depressing topic, school starts next friday and the past couple days i've been sittin my ass at home, maybe this is why im grumpy..::Sigh:: I feel like im a clean freak, cause greg (my bro) is sick n he's..well nvm lol im goin to get in trouble. but like this keyboard now i like soaked it in the germ killer stuff, along with the N64 controler and the remote controal to the TV.. i seriously hope i dont get sick, i hate getting sick. i really need a job too..next year i hope iget one.but watch wheni get a job next year, thats when people r goin to be callin me an askin me to hang out..i always get the bad luck of the draw, but im slowly getting used to it. Yep you also guess it Brian still has feelings for me, and i told him that i only liked him as a friend, but of course there will always be sparks between us, he was the only one to actually make me feel like..unbelievable. No one believes me, but i've given up trying to convince people that he isnt that bad, no one believes me anymore so why bother right? People keep on asking me who is this minnat kid, and how he seems like such a nice guy and they go on and on about it. yea he's nice, but he goes to Stevenson so i'm trying not to have a crush on him anymore, cause i know it isn' goin to work out. nothing ever works out for me either, so im used to that once again.  ooo well..i guess im goin to go back on living my sad life.. call the cell huh? keep me company in this boring town Libertyville...thanks. and dont ask me who i like cause i dont like anyone. People still think i like Brian, but i hardly ever talk to him anymore and even though he likes me doesnt me im automatically goin to like him... we'll see how school goes, probably good stuff, but along with goood stuff there is always drama and bad stuff...hah trust me i know.. later dudes and dudettes
Minnat call me
Brian call me,
Anyone..call me!"

Why do i always make the risky chance and end up screwed.  i'm sorry i cant let u do things that u want to do. i'm sorry that i cant do the things you want me to. All i want is for you to be happy. I'm terrified of relationships, im scared of love. you're going to be a senior, when im only goin to be a sophmore u go to stevenson while i go to Vernon Hills. I wont be able to see you over the weekdays cause thats a rule. I want to be with you, but im soo afraid of getting hurt thats why i say no.yea im scared of love, and yea im scared of moving on with you, but when i'm with you everything goes away, everything seems to blocked out of my head, its only you and me... well and your ferret sometimes..lol. We can give it a try babe, but i dont know if the feelings u have towards me will last during the school year because i cant go out during school days. I hope we can work it out...but..you've helped me overcome a stair that no one could help me with. You've made me happy when i was down.  in this, i hope he(brian)would understand and want me to be happy, and hope he wont forget bout me. I'm willin to take the risk and be with you...
Im scared that im putting my bestfriends relationship...but if hes a true friend..he would just want to see me happy. Call me when u read this okay babe?"

"event","yea so i was thinking all last night, maybe i should stop worrying about things. Maybe i should just go with the flow. You know i need to concintrate on what makes me happy, not trying to impress others, not trying to satisfy there needs, but mine. I dont want to look back when i'm older and say ""what would've happened if i did this"" I'm not living in the past, i'm not goin to question everything. I'm just going to live life as each second strikes my every move. So you know what, i'm going to do whatever i was want (well you know..not everything but reasonable things). No one has the right to tell me who is or isnt my friends, that my choice. I'm not stupid as i look, i know what can damage me, and i know what can make me happy. i know how to have a good time, and i know when to be serious. Everyone thinks im hanging with the wrong people, well i have news for you people, i might be hanging with the wrong people, but those people seem really nice, and im not going to ditch them because of a bad habit. Im not stupid im not going to get involved in drugs or drinking, personally i think its stupid, because what i have i wouldnt want to mess it all up for one bud, or for one drink. Im not goin to mess up my soccer career;although, many of you think i might do such a thing.  So all ihave to say to this, is that i am going to be aware of my surrounds and make the right discions, u have no worries no one can make me do drugs or drink, i have the power to say no (wow how cheesy is that haha). So if i hang out with my friend that goes to Stevenson, dont worry, i'm fine, i promise"

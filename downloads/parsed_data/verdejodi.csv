"event","Here are my interview questions from Gretchen the Great:

1. What is the appeal of reality TV? I know we've had this conversation before, but I just don't get it. What's the attraction?
I don't know. I think I like to see that people are even more fucked up than me. Plus I like yelling at them. With characters, I just can't get as angry. And I like to get angry.

2. Which professor is worse: Russ Shelley or John Matter?
Ooohhh.....now that's a good one. Well John Matter basically had a hand in scarring me for life, but I had to put up with Shelley's bullshit far longer. Matter refuses to use the letter Z because he's uppity, and Shelley is well, just uppity about everything. After careful consideration, and that fact that he gave us an anti-drinking lecture after telling us a friend's brother just committed suicide, I'll have to hand it to Mr. Russell Shelley.

3. What's your favorite episode AND line from SATC?
Hmmm...another stumper. Line: ""Some women aren't meant to tamed. Sometimes they have to run free until they find someone just as wild to run with."" Carrie
Episode: I like the one where they all go to a club after Burger broke up with Carrie on a post-it, then get caught getting high on the street. I could totally see that happening to us.

4. Let's say, theoretically of course, that you are a person who holds grudges for a long, long, long, longlonglong time. Do you think you could forgive someone if they sincerely apologized and tried to make amends? How much ass kissing would they have to do to get back in your good graces?
It would honestly depend on what they did and how much they meant to me. Remember Becky and Darren? I forgave her. It took a few months, but I did. And she didn't ass kiss. She sincerely apologized, then gave me my space until I could cool off. Why are you asking? Did you do something that I'm going to get pissed about ;-)

5. Does the thought of riding pants still make you chuckle?
Everytime 

Alternate question:

With your plans to one day rule the world, how long do you think you will be in power before your servants inevitably revolt and dispose of you in a most inauspicious manner assisted by a lovingly ambitious friend who plans to claim the throne as her own? 
Hahaha...I figure it'll take you at least a couple of months to get together with all the other high powered officers to dispose of me. I won't worry about the servants, they'll be treated well. And the people I don't like will be locked up, killed, or maybe just sterilized, so I'm not concerned about them either. 
Asshole

PS~My cousin is getting drafted this weekend for the NFL. They're thinking round 5 to the Steelers. Ethan Kilmer from Penn State. Watch for him!"

From April 15th-June 15th, I spend most of my days looking for turtles and other reptiles/amphibians. Lots of mud and muck, and it makes me crazy tired. But, I do get paid, so that's a good thing right?

Nothing particularly interesting to report. I'm just trying to get through bog turtle season without any major mishaps. Hope everyone is doing well...."

My friend Nick is planning on coming up next weekend for a visit. No shit, this will be the first time in 5 years of trying to get together at one of our schools/houses that actually worked out if he makes it up. He wrestled D1 at college, so even if I had plans to go down, or for him to come up, they usually got messed up with practices, team meetings, etc.

So yup, that's about it. Looking forward to doing some re-organizing tonight, as I got some new shelves and a chair at IKEA yesterday."

Tomorrow I head down to Sussex County, DE to install groundwater monitoring wells. While to the normal person this sounds like complete drudgery, I'm fairly excited about it. A few days out of the office, I like my coworkers that I'm going with, and who doesn't love a night at a hotel free of charge every now and again? Plus, it's supposed to be around 50-55, and I can't wait to be outside!!! I'll be sure to hug a tree for you, G.

"event","If you've never done a handwriting analysis, now is the time!!!! I did one yesterday, and it was scarily accurate. Below is a portion of the results, which are DEAD ON. I think the site I went to was handwritingwizard.com.  Enjoy!


Jodi is a practical person whose goals are planned, practical, and down to earth.  This is typical of people with normal healthy self-esteem. She needs to visualize the end of a project before she starts.  she finds joy in anticipation and planning.  Notice that I said she plans everything she is going to do, that doesn't necessarily mean things go as planned.  Jodi basically feels good about herself.  She has a positive self-esteem which contributes to her success.  She feels she has the ability to achieve anything she sets her mind to.  However, she sets her goals using practicality-- not too ""out of reach"".  She has enough self-confidence to leave a bad situation, yet, she will not take great risks, as they relate to her goals.  A good esteem is one key to a happy life.  Although there is room for improvement in the confidence catagery, her self-perception is better than average. 
 

In reference to Jodi's mental abilities, she has a very investigating and creating mind. She investigates projects rapidly because she is curious about many things. She gets involved in many projects that seem good at the beginning, but she soon must slow down and look at all the angles. She probably gets too many things going at once. When Jodi slows down, then she becomes more creative than before. Since it takes time to be creative, she must slow down to do it. She then decides what projects she has time to finish. Thus she finishes at a slower pace than when she started the project. She has the best of two kinds of minds. One is the quick investigating mind. The other is the creative mind. Her mind thinks quick and rapidly in the investigative mode. She can learn quicker, investigate more, and think faster. Jodi can then switch into her low gear. When she is in the slower mode, she can be creative, remember longer and stack facts in a logical manner. She is more logical this way and can climb mental mountains with a much better grip. 
 
 

Jodi will be candid and direct when expressing her opinion. She will tell them what she thinks if they ask for it, whether they like it or not. So, if they don't really want her opinion, don't ask for it! 
 
 

Jodi is moderately outgoing. Her emotions are stirred by sympathy and heart rendering stories. In fact, she can be kind, friendly, affectionate and considerate of others. She has the ability to put herself into the other person's shoes. Jodi will be somewhat moody, with highs and lows. Sometimes she will be happy, the next day she might be sad. She has the unique ability to get along equally well with what psychology calls introverts and extroverts. This is because she is in between. Psychology calls Jodi an ambivert. She understands the needs of both types. Although they get along, she will not tolerate anyone that is too ""far out."" She doesn't sway too far one way or the other. When convincing her to buy a product or an idea, a heart rendering story could mean a great deal to her. She puts herself in the same situation as the person in the story, yet she will not buy anything that seems overly impractical or illogical. Jodi is an expressive person. She outwardly shows her emotions. She may even show traces of tears when hearing a sad story. Jodi is a ""middle-of-the-roader,"" politically as well as logically. She weighs both sides of an issue, sits on the fence, and then will decide when she finally has to. She basically doesn't relate to any far out ideas and usually won't go to the extreme on any issue."

Your purpose in life is to express your unique self.

You are a creative and artistic person with an interesting view on life.
Witty and outgoing, you enjoy sharing your crazy ideas with anyone who will listen.
A total social butterfly, you're the life of any party.

In love, you inspire and enchant your partner. You are often an object of fantasy and desire.

While you are very talented, you sometimes lack the ambition to put your talents in play.
And while your wit carries you a long way, you occasionally use it to mask your true feelings.
Your natural abilities can bring you all the success in the world ... if you let them</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatisyourlifepathnumberquiz/"">What Is Your Life Path Number?</a></div>"

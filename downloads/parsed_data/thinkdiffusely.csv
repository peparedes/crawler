The work towards that advance sometimes seems to bring little excitement, until that moment when one finds out how exciting a project it is, and that moment may never come if there is no enthusiasm.

We have to nurture and encourage the individuals that we may sometimes consider overly enthusiastic.  They are in fact appropriately so, and we have no right to crush their dreams, visions and ideas.  They are the ones that see the truths that we cannot."

"event","Augh.  Screwed up sleep schedules, but no friends to share them with.  I'm not ready to grow up, and yet I try to act so much more experienced than I actually am.  I haven't been able to follow through with anything I've started recently, and I no longer have any clue of who I am AGAIN.  I thought this was only supposed to happen once.  One would think that I would have learned from my mistakes, but here are all of these opportunities again, opportunities that I worked hard for, and yet it seems that I'm just going to let them pass me by.

I can't believe how bitter I've become, but I kind of understand why; I've given up on the world.  I don't really care much about what people have to say to me anymore, and many things that truly used to interest me and move me just don't do it anymore.  In part I blame it on the rest of the world, for not sharing the same interests.  Why is the world nothing like what I would perceive it to be?  How come I have so little impact on the people around me?  I guess that's probably for the best though, or I guess maybe it's not completely true, idk.  I guess that in essence I've also given up on myself.

When it boils down to it, I think I'm just upset that things haven't turned out the way I would have wanted them to.  I'm just a spoiled brat.  I'm going through a crisis because after realizing 3 years ago that the world doesn't revolve around me it's finally beginning to sink in.  But I don't know who else to be.  I hope that there is something else that'll satiate my craving for continuous praise.

This post is all over the place.  I have to learn to gather my thoughts and focus them.  But I feel much better now, I think I really needed to vent."

"event","Why is it that we play these videogames that leave nothing to the imagination?  They cause us to waste most of our time, at least my time, and then we end up regretting it at the end of the day.  We say that we will cut down on the gaming, and what happens... I'll tell you what doesn't happen, cutting down.

It is really awful, to spend so much time in a mind numbing environment.  Kind of like TV on steroids, but at least TV programming offered a lot of different content.  So maybe it is more like playing with the testicles of TV after it has taken steroids.  Most of the games don't let you exercise your imagination, really, in my opinion.  At least not anymore.  When I started roleplaying games I was really into it, I thought of my character being in this totally foreign world, having spectacular powers like levitation, ice meteors, summoning dragons, etc... it was fun.  But now it's like the game fulfills that for you, you don't really have to imagine it.  You are limited by the bounds that have been created by the programmers, by their imaginations, you know?  Yet the games are still very enticing, and addictive.

I've forgotten how beautiful books are.  How they leave so many things open to interpretation.  How our senses aren't fulfilled so we have to fill them in ourselves.  I will say that science is beginning to lose its luster as my imagination begins to fade.  Science also sets bounds, but they can all be overcome one way or another.  These bounds are not defined by our world, but simply by the people who interpret our world.  The world has not been created by them.   

I think I want to take up drawing as a hobby, I don't know why I never did before, it's a great way to let my little scientific mind muse on paper.  I can draw my foolish little ideas for inventions, and maybe one day I can look back on them and say... ""hmmm, I wonder why I never made one of these.  Maybe I should.""  Ok, that will be my new years resolution, more drawing.

And more interaction with people.  Damn computer."

 Why can't I hold a conversation for more than 10 seconds?  Why does it take me so long to respond?  And why does nobody ever comment on the things I say?  It can't be that I speak THAT low THAT much of the time. I imagine that the things I say must be so foolish and outrageous that the people I talk to have no input on it.  Sometimes I am distracted by the idea that what I'm saying may not be clear, as opposed to focusing on the conversation itself.  That must be one of the reasons I have so much trouble.

It seems that in the end the issue may be confidence.  It is hard, though, to overcome that issue when my foolish outbursts reinforce the negative feelings I have toward speaking out.

*sigh* I'm going to stop filling in my speech with the stupid colloquial phrases that I seem to fall back on all of the time.  So that I am forced to actually pay attention and converse!  For now I think that might help."

Maybe I should just continue to ignore aspects of my life that I've developed, because that seems to be the only way a person can do good in school.  I can't live without playing at least one videogame, once a day.  They are a form of relieving stress, and I like it.  I can focus my mind on one thing only, without really even trying.  Yet, that is what is so bad about them, you become a zombie.  I wonder if I suffered some sort of brain damage in wrestling, or breakdancing, because I feel as if I can't keep up with other people, ever.  I can't handle more than one task at a time, I don't catch on as fast, or if I do catch on to subject matters it is in a totally divergent direction.  Plain and simply, I am abnormal.  I am not like anybody else, I've cultivated that because I love it, and now I have to pay for it.  But I don't know what I am ranting on about, I know perfectly well nobody is like anybody else, and everyone goes through similar episodes, but one can't help but wonder if the particular case one is exposed to is more severe.  Does this help me?  Spitting out a variety of justifications unto an electronic source so that those around me can see it.  What am I trying to accomplish?  Am I reasoning out with others why I am so abnormal?  Maybe it is that I know introspection requires an amount of insight, and it is my way of showing that off.  What the hell?  How come I can't strive for my own goddamned success, instead of simply striving for a bit of praise?  In psychology we went over something similar, it provided an explanation: People like me are short sited, we only look forward a day ahead, not for example a few years ahead, not even maybe a few weeks ahead for a good gread on a term paper.  I am overly motivated, I would say, to receive that extra praise from the teacher in class, or from my surrounding friends; I am selfish in the bad way, not in the expected way.  The way that is excusable by most because it's understandable that a person has to be a little bit selfish to get ahead.  I don't like that even though I'm realizing so much, I don't do anything about it.  I hate life.  It sucks.  Fuck you, I'm not excusing myself for ranting."

"event","Ugh!! I can't write unless I like the way it sounds to me after I write it.  I'll leave it for later.  but basically, I'm loving the way things are going.  I've settled back into my slacker niche, while maintaining that oh so familiar intellectual presence in my classes, even my lectures.  I've also been doing good on most of my tests, the only exception being chemistry.  

I keep finding out stuff about myself I didn't think I had in me.  It's amazing, it's like unveiling an entire side of me I had no idea about to me, and yet I still feel like I haven't lost sight of the me I know so well.  The growing accustomed to all of it is what will take time.  Sometimes I feel like everything is very dynamic, with no set form.  And that's fine, but funnily enough that takes some getting used to as well.

Sorry for being so vague; I am more comfortable thinking in abstracts.

anyway, I need to motivate myself to do more schoolwork, but there are so many distractions.  I will try a bit harder though."

"event","Whoa!! Has anyone clicked on the ""My LJ"" link?  Freaking cool. It's good for people like me who prefer not following a bunch of links all the time.  But what to write about?  I don't know.  There are so many things I can write about, but I don't think it makes a difference anymore.  It's simply been a way of solidifying some frames of referrence on my feelings, so that I could go back and pick up from that specific post if I screwed up.  Maybe, or maybe I'm just making stuff up now.  

My god, I'm so confused with how things are going.  Am I the only one who feels as if time is infinite?  What's with everyone's hurry?  Slow down and enjoy stuff.  I don't know what to think anymore.  I can't even write a coherent entry.  Which is pointless anyway, because we have to screw everything up with our differing perceptions.  'Says the hypocrite.'  Why do I feel like I don't even know what the conventions are, let alone be able to follow them?  I wish I could understand where and why I went wrong.  What happened to the me that always garnered so much attention, that everyone adored?  Why was I even exposed to that. and then to have it taken away from me, right beneath my nose; why even bother?  I rather not have experienced that at all.  I would rather have learned how to take a freaking interest in others for once.  My god, I just don't understand how one person could be so screwed up.  And even more, why that person has to be me?  What the hell am I afraid of?  Why do I fucking lie to myself so much?  How in the world is it that I can convince myself to restrain my urges?  Why does my god damned brain always draw a blank when people talk to me?  Why do I always have to wait for people to talk to me, why don't I just talk to them?  Why'd you fucking put me on this world if I didn't belong?  Why couldn't you just stick me under a pillow, and let me dream my life away?  Why do I have so many unanswered question, and why do I always try to find the answer when they never even help anything?    I no longer understand.  I guess, for now, I'll just try harder not to lie to myself, and others, even if it makes me a total asshole.  At least I won't be so burdened.

Life is so beautiful, but for some reason I don't get to enjoy it the way I want to."

"event","Goodbye cruel videogame world!  I will no longer be allowing myself to be drawn in by your eye and mind pleasing splendors.  I blame your stupid content filled, neverending, always making me want to play just a little more videogameness for my blandness. I can no longer allow your set of strings, scripts, codes, and any other form of syntax that you may contain to numb me the way they have.  You were always there to lure me in when I was weakest; because of you I've missed out on so many of life's lessons.  I've learned more about myself in the past 7 months that I've been relatively without your influence, than I have in my entire lifetime.  Videogames are worse than any drug, at least drugs have the decency of letting you know they're killing you.  Looking back I find it incredible how unreceptive you've made me toward so many things.  It's as if videogames siphon all their surrounding attention, allowing for no form of free thought.  I feel as if you've stripped me of all my teenage experiences.  And now I have nothing.  I have nothing to relate to, nothing to draw a story from, no self image.  Now I must somehow reclaim that wasted time, and you've made everything so much more difficult.

I guess I kind of understand, now, why I love Garden State as much as I do.

"event","How I love these gray October skies, and the just above the comfort-threshold chill from these October winds. And yet, as always, there's nobody here to love them with; to wrap her arms around me, beneath my jacket, and to tell me, while a side of her head rests on my chest, how she wishes she could hold on to me forever; I keep her warm.  I'd only be able to hear her because her voice at that instant resonates through my ribcage, and further on through the rest of my bones.  And so, I am the only one to hear her.  And in the same, secret manner I whisper in her ear how I could never let her go, thinking to myself how she's keeping me warm, and making me unreceptive to the chilled tear then rolling down my cheek.  Those two souls that never existed live eternally, in each other's arms.  I continue staring upward at this beautiful gray canvas, so uniform, and so deceptive in its appearance.  You would think that the world has been overcome by a sudden gloom, but in truth what has happened is that the sky has stopped caring.

Sometimes I wish I could learn a few things from the sky."

We had a sleepover in the coffeehouse last night, though it was not really a sleepover, cause the RA's kicked us out at 3 or 4.  It was still fun, we watched the Big Lebowski. I was the first one to actually fall asleep, only to be woken up by the silence and lack of presence of people.  I seemed to have also been the last one to wake up, or maybe the only one to wake up (I bet I looked like that invader Zim icon when I did).  Something about falling asleep while surrounded by a bunch of semi-strangers is really cool.  I don't think they were strangers at that point anymore though.  Maybe they were, just because there's always a little bit of strangeness in everyone, no matter how long you've known them.

I'm being called in for an interview on Monday, for a very convenient part time job.  I could use some money.  And it's a really big company.  I feel really cool whenever I'm affiliated with big stuff.  I hope the interview goes well."

I made some other people happy because I decided to play my guitar as we waited in line for our spots.  And I was in touching distance of both Daniel and Carlos as they were coming in.  I should've asked Dan to sign my guitar.  I also got a chance to hang out with a cool friend. And I had some cool revelations, on my way back to my dorm.

<i>Your view on yourself:
Other people find you very interesting, but you are really hiding your true self. Your friends love you because you are a good listener. They'll probably still love you if you learn to be yourself with them.

The type of girlfriend/boyfriend you are looking for:
You like serious, smart and determined people. You don't judge a book by its cover, so good-looking people aren't necessarily your style. This makes you an attractive person in many people's eyes.

Your readiness to commit to a relationship:
You prefer to get to know a person very well before deciding whether you will commit to the relationship.

The seriousness of your love:
Your have very sensible tactics when approaching the opposite sex. In many ways people find your straightforwardness attractive, so you will find yourself with plenty of dates.

Your views on education
You may not like to study but you have many practical ideas. You listen to your own instincts and tend to follow your heart, so you will probably end up with an unusual job.

The right job for you:
You're a practical person and will choose a secure job with a steady income. Knowing what you like to do is important. Find a regular job doing just that and you'll be set for life.

How do you view success:
You are afraid of failure and scared to have a go at the career you would like to have in case you don't succeed. Don't give up when you haven't yet even started! Be courageous.

What are you most afraid of:
You are afraid of things that you cannot control. Sometimes you show your anger to cover up how you feel.

Who is your true self:
You are full of energy and confidence. You are unpredictable, with moods changing as quickly as an ocean. You might occasionally be calm and still, but never for long.</i>

I think this thing tries to describe you by issuing a lot of generalized ideals of how you project yourself to yourself.  A month or so ago I would've said that some of this applies, though most of it still wouldn't have.  I think I've come to learn that a lot of times I haven't truely analyzed what it is I want, or I haven't been truthful to myself; I've simply been aiming at the ideals that project us unto the field of view of others as benevolent and interesting.  After looking back at a lot of the changes I've gone through, it's hard to accept such brief descriptions of myself.  It's also hard to believe that such general statements can apply to more than one person.  We're so so similar, in so many ways, but even so we are so complex that there is always an alteration in everyone that prevents them from being accurately generalized.  Though, I must say that I think we're always looking for something to relate to, and because of this we find relative situations within a lot of things, poetry, movies, music, crazy online self quizzes.  I think it's true that we do have a lot to relate to these things, but that's because the amount of experiences in one person's life are so extensive, that experiences between people overlap and are therefore shared by many people.  Anyway. What am I blathering on about?  I think the lack of opinion sharing is getting to me.  How did I even get into this? =)

When one person curses at another, they say, the curser rarely spews obscenities and insults at random, but rather will assess the object of his wrath, and adjust the content of the ""uncontrollable"" outburst accordingly.""

I don't know about you, but I find that pretty cool.  No wonder you feel really smart when you curse someone out.  Pretty ironic and tragic though, huh?  Our brain is at its best, using all the resources available to it, when it's being used for something negative...

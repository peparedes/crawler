"event","Somethings in my heart. Today has brought such a change in me. It feels like something really amazing is going to happen soon. Something that I've been looking for will be found. I woke up this morning smiling. My alarm went off at six thirty and instead of feeling sleepy with the words 'oh gawd, work' on my mind, I just felt happy. 
 It kept hitting me through the day. I'd have little bursts of wanting to sing or dance around the floors of the resteraunt. At first I thought I must be in love. It feels that way. But with who? Nothing happened yesterday to make me suddenly fall for someone like that. No, it's this feeling again. I've only got it once like this before, and it is way stronger now. Instead of the exitement it was before, now it's a kind of certainty. It feels like I'm about to fall in love. Thats the only way I can describe it.. it just feels like, it just feels like wow.

"event","I had a dream last night about an old friend i havent seen or spoken to in about three years. I woke up kinda missing her along with the days I could just call her up and say ""hey, d'you wanna come over?"" It made me think too much, about the things i miss of people who just don't exist anymore. 

Everyone grows up - but some people change from all recognision. 

There are so many people i want to write letters/emails to or call up, people who in my memory are so alive and real. But now they're all fairytale.

In other news, I found out a while ago but haven't wrote it down yet..
My pet scribby, the dog with the waggly tail as she was known, is dead. My dad told me after a double bill of the simpsons when Eleanor was over.

It's funny how with these things you hear the news and it doesn't register properly, you dont feel like crying because it doesn't seem like anyone's said anything factual, but your eyes start streaming almost like there's two parts of you - one who can't believe it, and the other who knows it's absolutely real.

According to my sister Mum had known she was really bad because she's brought her inside from her kennel to look after her properly. Why then hadn't she told me?? 

Anyway, Eleanor found her one morning just laying in her bed as if she was asleep. 

But this wasn't the day before I found out, it was TWO WEEKS before. 

This really hurt. For a start she'd been gone all this time and I thought she was fine, plus whenever a pet dies it's always been me who's burried them. I bet that slime Paul was there being all comforting and saying ""you're right not to tell 'camirra' she'd only upset things"" He's always saying things like that. How the hell does he know anything about me he's met me about three times and it's not like I say anything when he's there. He's always telling me I'm a goth or something which I resent only because it's stereotyping plus wearing a dark coat because it's snowing outside does not make you goth. 

I just feel really bad because it always seemed like Scribby thought I was deserting her. How could she know I had to leave because my mother hated me. She couldn't, and after everyone of my visits when i had to go, her tail would stop waggling so fast it looks like a kid scribbling on paper, she'd stand motionless as if I was never coming back. And I guess I never was. I never got to see her again. She was only six, I mean one day I was gonna rescue her and Min, when I got my own house, they'd come with me and I'd never be mean to them like my Mother.

 I mean if you've ever lost a pet who's been with you most of your life you'll know this sort of thing matters. 

Apparently Mum told Eleanor it was best if I never knew.

WHAT THE FUCK?? Like I'm not gonna go over there see Min all alone and ask ""Where is my dog Mum?"" Like hell she was thinking of me, she just didn't wanna have to spend time with me in her house, even if I'd be in a completely different room looking after my sick animal. 

I hadn't seen her since before Christmas, I haven't seen my mother for that long either. I'd given her this early christmas present just something really small, this little dog that when you squeezed it's belly it said ""mwah I love you!"".

She told Eleanor I just gave it to her because it was pretty not because I actually care about her. 

Anyway I could sit and rant about her all day but before I start I'm gonna go.

"event","<FONT color=#9999ff><EM>Yesterday should have been framed in porceline.</EM> <BR>&nbsp;We were greeted with Maggies impression of my <STRONG>'Batman'</STRONG> charade, which has become a common joke. Hehe I guess I did look kinda spacky but you're ment to in those games aren't ya.<BR>&nbsp;And so the evening followed with another game of charades, Carl's impression of Puff Daddy/P-Diddy being maybe the most memorable.<BR>At half eleven hours, after me and <EM>Cartle Frasin</EM> finally conquered our Dr. Oetker's mozzerella pizza the lot of us minus Graham (equalling = Me, <EM>Cartle Frasin</EM>, Emma, Rich, Maggie and Spoon sauntered off in our coats and hoodies to Carlton Garage which was mainly shut, so our mini eggs and ribina (2 cartons each, more fun than a bottle) were handed to us through one of those security things you get in banks. Then we set off to Carlton Park. If you've never been, it's just your average kid's park infront of a hill (the stack) with those silly little swings they make for two year olds that hurt like hell to swing on but you do anyway because you want to be the one who can swing higher than all your friends. It's got those little animals on springs too, but no roundabout.<BR>&nbsp;It was about half twelve when the first spits of rain started falling so we headed back to our homes with our arms pulling in from our sleeves and our hoods up.<BR>&nbsp;I realised this way you could stick your hands out front and make it look like you had <STRONG><U><EM>giant bazzomers</EM></U></STRONG>, which everyone joined in with, exept emma and Richard who didn't have the right kinda coats (<EM>actually I think Rich was just not so keen to copy the look)</EM>. <BR>&nbsp;Anyhoo, we were all walking down the road with our fake titties and our hoods still up even though there turned out to be no rain, until we came to the place where we go our different ways. That's&nbsp;when we decided to make beerbellies instead and started bouncing off each other with them in some strange kind&nbsp;of <EM>belly war</EM>. It was fun anyway. Emma was gonna stop with us but decided not to so we all to out own places and got in about 1 AM and that concludes the epic adventure!</FONT>"

"event","<FONT color=#ff99ff>So the story unfolded we met at Kev's just making the cab and jumped in. It was a fairly tight squeeze considering there were nine of us but isn't that an essential part of the fun? <BR>&nbsp;Bowling = Coke and mars bars, even if you don't buy them yourself you're going to get forcefed until you can barely lift your ball. Hehe. It was fun that night because we never wen't home. On the walk back Maggie spotted Carl's dad in his coach home from work so we got a lift back to Kev's where we played Pictionary and Charades, helped ourselves to microwaveable carbonara (the mars bars had long since been devourered) and talked about music and probably fucking everything. <BR>&nbsp;You probably read that wrong if your mind is like anyone's I know. Mine is too.<BR>&nbsp;We walked sleepily back in I'm not kidding, Gale force style winds to Emma where (probably unwisely) Carl, Emma and Rich got me to tarot read for them. <BR>&nbsp;I made the mistake of joking if I did myself one I'd get three 6's lined up and <STRONG><EM><U>DEATH</U></EM></STRONG>(<STRONG>!!)</STRONG> - by the way if you ever get that, it is not an indication of dying so don't start planning what kinda handles you want on your coffin already, k.) <BR>and then I basically did which was kinda funny yet unnerving. <BR>&nbsp;I'm still here tho, so put the pom poms away. :P<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Carl (aka Cartle Frasin, heh)&nbsp;and I pulled ourselves home with a bag of <EM>Jameson's</EM> chocolate raisins for company and I'm telling you when I fell into bed this morning at 9 something I felt something close to euphoric.<BR>xx&nbsp; </FONT>"

You tend to be selfish. You are the most likely type to hog the covers.
You gravitate toward comfort and don't like extreme situations.

The seduction game you play is tried, true, and still effective: hard to get.
You know that the best seducers turn the tables - and get their crush to seduce them.
The one running has the power, and you're a challenge that is worth the chase.

You are a master of enticing and pulling back. Giving a little and taking some away.
You are controlled enough to know rewards come after a long seduction dance.
Even though you want to call, email, or say ""I love you"" first - you don't!

You're style is the perfect mix of hot and cold - so much so that you have many suitors.
Think Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's ... or any of those creepy guys from the Bachelor.
You're skilled at inspiring a chase. The real test is picking the person to slow down for.</font></td></tr></tbody></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

My Grams picked up a $2 scratchers ticket this morning. It was one of those Crossword puzzle ones. Well i get a phone call around 10 this morning from my mother saying that grams won $500. I was like wow. Well I get home and I want to go rent Vanity Fair from Hollywood Video. So we go. And then on the way back we stop at FRY's to try to cash in the ticket. Grams had tried at BASHA's earlier in the day but they could only do $100 or less. We get to the costomer service counter and the woman runs the ticket through the scanner. ""Hey, lady,"" says the woman,""You musta won biiiiigggg. I can't cash this."" 
We inform her that we won $500. 
""Noooo. It hasta be more than that. We can cash up to $500. You won big."" 
We tell her that there was only 8 words and that means $500. So we count up the words. There was only 8. ""Must be a mistake then"" the woman suggested. 
We thanked her and left. We get in the truck and I realize something. I tell grams to let me see the ticket. Se gives it to me. I look it over and then I realize that we were wrong. 
""Its nine. There are nine words."" 
""What?"" grams looked at me like I was nuts. 
""Ummm, well, you forgot to scratch of a C. See?"" 
""Oh. Well how much is nine words?""
""Ahhhhhhhhh. Oh my."" I was speechless for a second.
""Tanya, how much is-""
""Twentyfivehundreddollars."" I said in a rush.
""Oh my...my...my.""

Now if only I could win a boyfriend."

before 7th hour ended. I don't know. I guess after I didn't make it
into Ensemble I kind of lost confidence in myself. But, I'm over that. <br>
<br>

People at the auditions did very well. I was shocked and amazed by some of them.&nbsp; <br>

It was a little weird without Andrew and Amanda and all the other
senirs that we lost from last year. But the new seniors this year are
gonna kick ass too.<br>
<br>

I still have the damn songs stuck in my head. I wanna just tip my head
to the side and shake them out but the only thing that'll accomplish is
giving me a headache.<br>

I should be doing my Econ homework right now...ha. Screw Econ. Mr.
Schwarz can stuff the current event up his...well you get the idea.<br>
<br>

I'm not going to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Homecoming</span>. I'm so broke right now. I spent my last 3
dollars on a ticket to the Ensemble show. So I can't even afford to
split a ticket with someone. Eh. Cynthia can't go because he has to
work so some of us people that can't go are going to meet down at her
work (Target) and have our own Homecoming.<br>
<br>

I applied to 4 places for a job this week. Pier One Imports, The Dollar
Tree, Osco Drug and Sonic. I really want to work at Pier One. Sonic
would be okay. They make pretty good tips. The Dollar Tree I could
really do without. And Osco? I'd shoot my brains out. I guess beggars
can't be choosers so, whatever. I'll deal.<br>

</span><lj-cut text=""Of course MB wouldn't..."">Of course MB
wouldn't admit that to just anyone. That little girl was just lucky
that I didn't throw a book at her head instead. That rhymed. Anyway
Next time she is singing I just might kick her out of the black box OR
maybe I will just tell her that if she has any hope at all of getting a
part in the musical she would be wise to shut it before MB really
begins to hate her.&gt;<br>

"event","So...today was... very nerve-wracking. Last callbacks. A lot of very talented people. I was nervous before but now that it is done, I'm not. Maybe because I know it is done and what's done is done and can't be changed. I hope that I get to be in Ensemble again. It would be a miracle if I do. I think my auditions went well, but I also think that everyone else's went excellent. I don't know. I just don't have much faith in myself. But regardless if I make it in or not, I will still be happy for those that do and sad for those that don't. It is a very sought after position.

I finished my college application essay. Woo-hoo. It only took me and hour and a half and I think it rocks. I'm sure Mr. Black will find many things wrong with it. Oh well. I'll fix it.

I discovered while visiting POGB today that I have a 116% in one of my classes. It must be a mistake. I'll have to talk to my teacher.

All my other classes are going very well and that makes me very happy. Well, I need to go work on even more homework. And eat my Brownie earthquake from Dairy Queen."

Monday for the first auditions there was about 60 people who showed up. Most of us didn't get out of there until 6 o'clock. It took for-EVER. I personally did horrible on those. I waited too long and I had racked up my nerves so...yeah. I don't like to think about it. I saw alot of people practicing in the hall that I thought were pretty good. And most of them made it.

Tuesday, today, First Callbacks. 25 left. A lot better for me I think. Not my best...most everyone else did really well though. I thought Sam Jensen did a great Tina. Slap the BITCH. That's right. There was slappage. Kelsey Tortsvite did an excellent Tina too. She made ME cry! Jeez. All in all there was alot of good people. A LOT of females there. Only 6 guys.

I don't think I am going to get in this time. I thought last year was some sort of mistake or that Mr. Bush lost his marbles temporarily. Like I said. A lot of talent there. Only one freshman. I can't remember her name...

Tomorrow, Second Callbacks. I think it is only going to be 15 people. Not sure who. It's a surprise. Then he will cut it down to 9 or 10 for the Final List. There were 7 people who auditioned that were in Ensemble last year. That leaves 2 or 3 open spots IF everyone makes it in again.

I guess we will find out soon enough...

Tomorrow. Another installment of...THE AUDITION."

Your taunts were pains i'll never tell,
I hope you burn and die in hell.
Maybe that was a bit too strong,
I could never hold a grudge that long.
But my amnity is lost towards you,
Of this, at least, I know is true.
I'll never try to be your friend,
And if you try I'll put an end
To all your folly and all your pride.
So you, in truth, should step aside.
'Cause you dont know me but I know you,
There are many out there just like you.
You're nothing but another clone,
Society-altered but Godly-sown.
So in you I know there's good,
Though not as much as I think you should.
But still I thank you for your hate,
After all, it was a part of fate.
From hate a fiery passion was born,
And now your taunts go on forlorn.
For I am, already, on fire.
So great a blaze not to admire.
So bright a light not to hide away.
So strong a will not to obey.
So torrid a flame not to retreat.
So abundant a fuel not to depleat.
So feed the fire, and watch it grow,
Force the urge back down below.
With a bucket drain a moat,
Send the curses back down your throat.
Learn a lesson, heed it well,
Take pride in that you'll never tell."

I hope this gets to all of you.  I know I have correct e-mail addresses for some of you but the others may get bounced back.  So, if you have the correct e-mail addresses for Ben, Skylar, Jessica, Jake, Preston or Emily, please forward it to them.

Anyway....

I got word, yesterday, that VOICES AND OTHER DISTURBANCES was selected for a workshop/showcase production by a theatre company in New York.  According to the company's Artiistic Director, the group's Executive Producer of the company has ""called dibs"" on directing the play herself.   I restructured the play to be performed by 5 actors (3 female/2 male) for their production.  No dialogue has changed.   One of the cool things about the restructuring, is that I changed Actor 1, Actor 2, et. al. in the opening sequence to use your actual names.  So the play now has characters named for all the 2004-2005 NCTE members.

Here's the summary/teaser that accompanied the script that they read to consider it for production:

Ballpark franks and a boss not washing his hands after using the restroom.  A pop star whose sanity is slipping away.  Whose thoughts merely meander through a few trivial twists and turns and whose mind is truly twisted?  VOICES AND OTHER DISTURBANCES explores the lives of a quirky assortment of characters. The approach is irreverent and amusing and audiences will ponder dryer lint, a cheerleader with a broken neck and whether or not to order the flounder and call their mother.

Do you hear voices?  Use Lemon Pledge.

I will most likely go back to New York to see the production.  But, of course, I've already seen the original cast.  :)

My best,

I mean I'd love to be apart of it again but last year I just didn't feel like part of it. I don't like that feeling. I'm afraid that it will be like that again. Or that I won't make it at all.

And I keep on breaking more, 
And it looks like I am shaking

Make-believing

And the bathtub full of flies

Don't call the doctors 
cause they've seen it all before. 
They'll say just, 
Let.

Crash. 
And. 
Burn. 
She'll learn.

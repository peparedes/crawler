"event","Ok, I have a feeling this is going to be a long one.  We've got a lot of catching up to do.  

Friday night when Kathryn, Janette, and I went downtown for the fireworks was quite possibly one of the strangest evenings of my life.  We got off the RTA and Kathryn and Janette got some food from Taco Bell/KFC.  I guess Janette thought it would be fun to eat a taco even though she had just gotten her tonsils out the week before, and within one minute, she turned to the side and spit out a rather large pile of blood onto the ground.  I looked over at Kathryn, who started freaking out, Janette started to get really scared, and I felt it was time to go get a police officer.  I went and found one of those Mountie-looking officers in Tower City and told him what was going on.  He then went up to some guy in a suit and they started speaking some other language together really fast.  They called the EMS people, and I went back outside to help calm Janette (and Kathryn for that matter) while she filled up half a cup with blood.  It was really frightening to see her losing so much blood, but some crazy old policeman kept us laughing at the insane things he was saying to Janette.  He basically told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her, that her throat looked really bloody, and asked her if she was pregers or had HIV.  Talk about kicking someone when they're down, but for some reason it was really funny to all of us.  Janette wasn't bleeding too badly by the time the EMS crew got to us, because they took forever.  They were really nice, and they let us all pile into the ambulance, but they wouldn't drive over to the Clinic until they had all of Janette's info and it took forever.  The Deans actually got to the ER from Chagrin before we did from Tower City.  Unfortunately, the ER just brought a lot more waiting, and when the doctor removed the blood clot in her throat, she started to spit up a ton of blood again and had to get two IVs because of all the blood she lost.  She had to stay overnight for surgery to cauterize the area in her throat that was cut.  Thankfully, she is recovering now and is doing pretty well considering all she's been through.  Kathryn and I wanted to stay with her, but Mr.  Dean took us home around midnight or so.  The trip home was quite memorable if I do say so myself.  (I think Kathryn would agree.) 

To make up for such a stressful and scary night, yesterday was really great for the most part.  Kathryn and I went to the beach on the most perfect day imaginable.  There were no clouds, a light breeze to keep us from overheating, no bugs, plenty of pb&j and grapes, and a little bit of sunblock to prevent burning.  It was pretty relaxing, and I might of even got some sun.

Last night was absolutely fabulous.  Jeremy is the sweetest guy I've ever known.  I can't believe someone would go out of their way so often to make me feels so special.  I can't explain how adorable he is or how much I appreciate everything he does for me.  <blush>  Ok, I'm all sorts of giddy now, so I think I'm gonna go enjoy the feeling."

"event","Ah, it smells like a new month!  Summer is officially in full swing as the 4th is just around the corner.  In fact, Kathryn, Janette, and I are going downtown tonight for some festive fireworks and a little serenade by the Cleveland Orchestra.  I'm pretty excited about the whole adventure even though I just got back from downtown about an hour and a half ago.  I guess I can just never get enough of those crazy old RTA drivers.  

Speaking of my earlier Cleveland adventures today, I was down at CSU taking my final, and I have now successfully completed General Chemistry I in a 6 week period.  Now on to Gen. Chem. II for the next 6 weeks, followed by two weeks of freedom, and then back home to Denison.  Wow, strange how I consider Denison a home.  I'm not really sure how I feel about that one.

Anyway, last night I saw Spiderman 2 with Jeremy, his brother Jon, and his friend Steve.  Let me tell you, good times my friends.  Go see this movie, it's worth whatever outrageous price they charge you to see this on the big screen.  I think pretty much anyone would enjoy it.  The special effects are amazing, the story's exciting, there's love and romance, revenge, lots of fighting and destruction, a hot girl, a handsome guy, a crazy villain, and a Dashboard song to entertain you during the credits.  What more could you ask for???  Liz's rating-A"

"event","Ah, one more day until freedom.  That's right, as of 6pm tomorrow evening, I will have full range of my house and a car!  How refreshing.  Too bad I'm the only person I know of that doesn't get to go on a vacation...ever.  Oh well, at least it's a vacation from my parents, right?

Anyway, here's the week in review before the crazy weekend begins...
I woke up earlier than most farmers, went to school, played with chemicals, hung out with friends, studied, smiled a lot (carolyn knows why), and ate a bunch of food.  You know, the usual. 

Nick's graduation party was fun.  Kathryn and I ate some good Chag Town grub and congratulated Nick on finally graduating high school.  His mom made us take pictures in a cardboard cut out of a graduate in cap and gown.  It was funny.  I love Nick's mom.

I went fishing with Jeremy and Brian.  Jeremy caught a lake shark, but then it got caught in a tree and he lost it.  Yes, yes, it's sad but true.  But he caught a nice sized catfish right when we were about to leave, so he redeemed himself.  Brian and I didn't catch anything, but we did get to enjoy making fun of the hippie kids playing guitar and the nasty sewer lovers swimming in the lake.  All in all it was a good night if I do say so myself.

I just beat Jeremy at dnL online checkers!  WooHoo!!!  In all fairness he did beat me the game before this, but this game that I won took forever, so I feel pretty good about myself right now.  I can't really remember what else happened this week.  All the weeks sort of blend together in the summer, you know?  It's strange.  Oh well, I guess I'll leave it at that for now."

Happy 21st Birthday Kathryn!  Drink up!

Now that that's taken care of, we can continue.

The weirdest thing happened last night.  I was driving Jeremy back to his house and upon making a left turn, I simply didn't see exactly where to turn and almost past the street I was turning on.  Now everybody knows that I'm blind, but I've never had a problem like that before.  Granted, I don't see as well at night as I do in the day, but I've never had any major driving issues before, no tickets, no accidents, no big problems really.  It made me feel extremely embarrassed and frustrated.  Plus I think I scared the shit out of Jeremy, so I feel really bad about being so retarded.  I don't really know what happened, but I think I'm going to avoid having other people in my car at night as much as possible so that I keep the heart attacks to a minimum.

Anyway, I got to meet a few of Jeremy's friends, and they all seem really nice, pretty eccentric at times, but cool.  It's nice to be able to have a good time with people when you're just hanging out and not really doing much.  It's a sign of good company and quality people.  You can't ask for much better.

Today's looking like a pretty average Saturday.  I'm going to go drop off an application and pick up another one.  Then I'll probably mess around with my guitar and hopefully hang out with Becca for a while.  Finally, I think I'm ending the evening at Nicole's with the usual crowd.  Not the most exciting day in the world, but it may be fun.  I'll let you know."

"event","Ok, so last night's party for Kathryn's birthday turned out quite differently from what I had imagined.  I was really excited about it and about fun times with some amazing people, but instead, everyone appeared to catch the plague.  Plus, I was pretty disappointed in myself for being somewhat inconsiderate to someone very special, and now I will have to work harder to start acting in ways that better express the way I'm feeling, because I know that the way I am feeling is important.

I've come to the conclusion that I shouldn't really question and analyze my feelings so much.  Sometimes you just have to go with them.  I can't feel guilty for moving on and being happy.  I think I am entitled to some happiness.  Therefore, I have officially cut the cord to the past and look ahead to bettering the present and future, because this is where I want to be.  I want to be here now, because this is where I feel comfortable, excited, and happy.  Where I am now feels like where I should be, so I'm moving forward and not looking back."

My aunt and uncle just adopted two little kids from Russia and they brought them over.  They are so adorable!  The little baby boy, Posha, is going to be 1 year old on June 12th and the little girl, Lera, is going to be 3 in October.  I couldn't stop smiling when they were around.  I love babies and little children.  It's once they start talking back and running around like crazy little people that I get annoyed with kids.  These two were absolutely wonderful.  Ah, children are so refreshing.

In other news, I'm thoroughly enjoying the company of my new friend.  I love meeting new people, especially ones like this who just seem to fit with me.  These are the best kind of strangers, the ones who make you feel like they knew you long before you actually met.

P.S.  June: you are the greatest.  I couldn't have dreamed of a better big.  Thank you for your call.  I love you dearly!"

"event","I think that believing in fate is kind of like cracking open a crisp, golden fortune cookie.  It takes a lot of effort to find what you're looking for without chipping or breaking apart some of your surroundings/people in your life.  Then, once you discover what you've been searching after, you examine it, contemplate it for a bit, and it still makes no sense.  Apparently it's not supposed to make sense.

I don't know about my life lately.  It's all very odd.  The most unexpected things happen at the most random times, and these crazy things seem to occur more frequently the older I get.  I've felt a wide range of roller coaster emotions in the past few weeks, but I think keeping busy this summer is helping me wade through all of the fog inside of my head.  Taking summer classes at Cleveland State is quite possibly the best decision I could have made.  It keeps me from being lazy and wasting sunshine-filled days, it frees up my schedule senior year at Denison, I get to become best friends with all of the RTA operators, I have a lot of time and freedom to explore the city I was born in, it keeps my mind off of drama, and I get to hang out with some really amazing new people.  So far so good overall, I guess.  I just wish that some things could have happened differently."

"event","You know how there are some people in life that you know so well that you can tell how they are feeling, what they are thinking, and what they are about to say the moment they walk through the door?  Well I truly love that; a relationship, no matter what kind, can't get much better than that kind of closeness.  These might included family members for some, co-workers for others, but for me these people are my treasured friends, both at home and at school.  These are the people that I love the most and who are always there for me, often knowing me better than I know myself.

However, there are other people in my life that I can't seem to read so well.  There is this cloudy haze keeping some of my friends closed in and preventing the formation of this closeness.  This kink in connection can make me frustrated, ignorantly blissful, discouraged, or indifferent.  It all depends on the situation, but lately, I really wish I had a lie detector in my brain, so that I could break through the communication blockade that keeps me from completely understanding some people.  

Sometimes it's really hard to know who's side of the argument to believe, or if you're just being fed lines others think you want to hear, or what you should simply disregard immediately.  Maybe honesty is behind the words of these people, and their words should be accepted for what they are, but maybe it's deception that fuels the movement of their lips.  I hate that it's so hard to distinguish between what is false and what is true with these people.  It inhibits my ability to try and help them, be there for them, or improve our relationship, and it leaves me lost and confused with myself.  Why can't everyone just say what they are thinking and feeling instead of feel the need to make up some bull shit because they think it is the right thing to do.  The only right thing is the truth."

-I think I left my actual journal in Chicago, and I need a place to write down the crap floating around in my head.
-I was inspired by actually reading Dave's journal for once.
-I am obsessed with my computer and can't live without it.
-I can either do this or unpack all my stuff from school.
-I cried today, which is something I don't like to do very often, so I obviously need to get something out of my system.

And there you have it, now let the games begin!

Ok, first of all, I just got back from a road trip to Chicago where I got to spend some good old fashioned quality time with one of my best friends, Becca, her boyfriend Charlie, her roommates Jenny and Shawnie, and my road trip partner, Dave.  I think everyone can agree that we drank, we slept, and we conquered (and with minor injuries at that!)  Yeah, it was a fairly successful road trip, although the solo drive back to Cleveland was so boring I wanted to gouge my eyes out.  However, I made pretty good timing, so I decided against the gouging.  The entire trip was almost entirely drama free (minus a few things that I should have known better about), which unfortunately is not the case for the remainder of this entry. 

Have you ever noticed how as soon as things seem to begin making sense, something comes along and shakes it all up, leaving you face down in the snow like a poor, helpless group of carolers in a snow globe?  It's such bull shit.  I honestly believe that everything happens for a reason, but sometimes God enjoys challenging this belief a little too much.

I wonder, can you be in love with someone and still have feelings for someone else?  Is that allowed, or is it impossible?  How can you ever be sure that the love you feel is true love and nothing will ever compare?  

One of my close friends and her practically fiance just broke up, and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were/are in love.  So then why are they faced with so much pain and disappointment right now?  I hate it.  It makes me feel sick, and I can't begin to understand it.  I guess I'm just not supposed to."

"event","Whilst enjoying my leisurely walk in the garden this afternoon, I came about a large beautiful bush of red roses. Their scent was upon the air long before I reached them; I nearly cried with joy and sadness. 
Oh, I miss Adam so. Everyone here is just delightful, <strike>except those pirates... why such a respectable girl as Kairi would associate with those ruffians I've no idea</strike> but it's just not the same. 
Off to the Library I go again. And I will everyday to research.

Would anyone else care to join us?"

What in the world happened? I will say this though - I am so glad there are horses about. I think I shall go for a ride today."

"event","Ok ok, so let me get this straight. 
In the future, a group of people invented something called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"">'Television'</a>. People sat in front of it watching shows about adventure instead of going outside to have a real adventure. 
Then two men from Japan invented something called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"">video game system</a>, and most Earth children have never been outside since. 

Why would anyone want to sit inside watching adventures instead of going out and <i>doing</i> them? I mean, books are wonderful for learning and starting the ideas for adventures, but to live your life inside? 

This is terrible! Aeroplanes are scary, but I like them far more than this television and video game systems."

"event","I took Tamaki's advise and started reading some books on aeroplanes. They are quite the invention! To be able to fly to far off lands in only a matter of hours insteadof it taking days or months of travel? 
What other inventions have people come up with in the future?"

"event","Today was interesting to say the least. I posted a sign on the Library doors and a few people came inside. The only people from Earth are from Japan... and apparently Japan in the future. They have these things call aeroplanes that fly through the air, like Birds, that carry people in them to take them places. It's faster than horse and carriage? I can't see how that could work and *not* be magic, at least in part. 
I mean, how else could you explain such odd things, especially people being taken from different worlds and times and being placed here?  

(Next part private to Belle)
I found a book on Adam today. About his time as Beast, and about how he was before the Enchantress came. And pictures. So many pictures! Adam had destroyed all the ones at the castle... he was such an adorable boy *smiles*"

"event","Today I am going to go and explore outside. I met this boy named Sora who says he knows me, but i have no idea who he is. Have I lost my memory? Is that why I don't know how I got here? Where is everyone I know? I miss Adam so much...
Well, standing here complaining isn't getting me anywhere. I don't know what's going on, but I intend to find out. 


((OOC: I don't know how many of you know this, but Beast's human name is Adam.))"

"event","After exploring the room I woke up in, and tentitively saying hello to my dresser, I went downstairs. I had looked outside to see this gorgeous beach and wanted to get a better idea of where in the world I was. I reach the bottom of the stairs to what I assumed was the front door. But when i opened it... my heart nearly stopped. It wasn't outside, oh no, it was a ceiling to floor bookcase. I step forward and take a book from the shelf, one of my favourites, and looked to my right. Then to my left. The entire wall is covered in books! Fasinated, I slowly start walking to the left and turn the corner... to more books. I have never seen so many books in my entire life, not even at the castle! I scan the titles... some I have read, some I have never heard of. Some were in languages where the writing made no sense to me whatsoever. 
After goodness knows how much time had passed, I found myself at a large desk near what I soon found out was the actual front door. A woman was there. 

""Um, excuse me,"" I inquired ""where am I?"" 
""You are in the Library."" 
""Well, yes, i know that, but where is the library located?""
""Nirvana."" 
""Oh. Well, thank you, but-""
""Your duties begin tomorrow at 9am sharp, lunch break from noon until 1pm, closing is at 5pm. Monday to Friday only, the Library is closed on Saturdays and Sundays. any time not in Lirbary hours is your own to do as you please.""
""Pardon?"" I said, shocked and almost annoyed. The woman raised an eyebrow. 
""I said your duties begin-""
""Yes, yes, I got that. Why would I have duties? I'm confused.""
""Everyone in Nirvana has a role, a place. Yours is the Librarian to the Library.""
""But where is Nirvana? Why am I here?"" 
The woman then stood up, gathered her things, and put on her hat.
""You'll find that out soon enough. Good day Belle."" And then she left. 

This is all so very frustrating. Where am I? What's going on? This library is amazing, but I'd kind of like to know why I've been put in charge of it. One thing is for sure, I will get to the bottom of this. Now to find the History section..."

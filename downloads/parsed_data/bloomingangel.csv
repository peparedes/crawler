i'm SOOO excited for college.  i have all music classes except for one and that is only b/c i hadta have an honors class.  AND i got my AP exam scores back and this year along with last year's stuff pretty much makes me a sophomore, technically.  i'm so excited for band and marching band and baroque oboe and *sigh!*

but at the same time, i'm not so sure about the whole college thing.  seems kinda weird that i won't be living at home.  and i won't be able to have my cat (as trivial as that may sound... it really isn't...)  and while it SEEMS liek there aren't rules in college and u can do whatever u plz there really are hidden rules and junk like that.  and even if i had spare time (which i'm not sure i will w/band and bowling) what would i do with it?  i'm not the party type.  i dunno.  and what about money?  the luxuries i'm used to at home won't exist really.  yah know, movies, a bit of shopping, fast food.  i won't get that at college.

but enough being so pessimistic.  I'M EXCITED!  TOTALLY!  i've talked to my roommate over the phone and she seem totally cool.  we have lotsa stuff in common like what kinda books we like and watchin movies... things like that.  so that's good that she's not some weirdo that i won't relate to and be like ""argh"".

and also, these days i've had random bouts of being really mad for no reason at all... and things bug me really easily.  and that really bugs me (no pun intended AT ALL... perhaps i should say ""bothers me"".)  i don't understand why i can be so freakin pissed off when i have no clue why.  and then that just makes me more mad and leads to other annoying emotions.  and it's not PMS.  i know that.  at least that would make SOME sense.

well what a crummy way to end a LJ... but this is pretty long for me."

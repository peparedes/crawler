"event","i didnt update for a few days, have been very busy with homework (i still have to study the last 3 years history part)
so what happened lately.. umm..
first of all, i went to the cinema and saw finding nemo :D it was a lovely movie
and err i had a geography oral test, and i get a very bad mark... even if i replied right to almost all the questions, that's just totally unfair.. but i know the teacher doesnt like me, and she always keeps saying that i dont like doing things with my classmates... yeah, i prefer doing a lot of things alone than with them, i have my good reasons to think that, and she cant tell me that it's wrong. i like being like that, and so what? i hate having to think about what to write in our works while they all have fun.
and today we invited my bro for lunch
i think that's all for now. :)

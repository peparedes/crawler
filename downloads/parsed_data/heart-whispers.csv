In a parallel universe.

Where nothing breaks and nothing hurts.

There&#39;s a waltz playing frozen in time.

Blades of grass on tiny bare feet.

I look at you and you&#39;re looking at me.



Could you beam me up?

Give me a minute,I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d say in it.

I&#39;d probably just stare,

Happy just to be there holding your face.

Beam me up.

Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter.

I think, a minutes enough.

Just beam me up.



Some black birds soaring in the sky.

Barely a breath I caught one last sight.

Tell me that was you, saying goodbye.

There are times I feel the shiver and cold.

It only happens when I&#39;m on my own.

That&#39;s how you tell me I&#39;m not alone.



Could you beam me up?

Give me a minute,I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d say in it.

I&#39;d probably just stare,

Happy just to be there holding your face.

Beam me up.

Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter.

I think, a minutes enough.

Just beam me up.



In my head, I see your baby blues.

I hear your voice and I,

I break in two and now there&#39;s one of me with you.



So when I need you can I send you a sign?

I&#39;ll burn a candle and turn off the lights.

I&#39;ll pick a star and watch you shine.



Could you beam me up?

Give me a minute,

I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d say in it.

I&#39;d probably just stare,

Happy just to be there holding your face.

Beam me up.

Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter.

I think, a minutes enough.

Just beam me up.

Beam me up.

Beam me up.

Could you beam me up?"

"event","There has been far too many suicides lately. From hockey players to 15 year old boys. It&#39;s just not right. And I know there&#39;s probably many others that don&#39;t make the news. My brother&#39;s best friend killed himself when he was 18 and to this day it is still so heart-breaking.

I know this probably won&#39;t be seen by a lot of people, but I&#39;m going to make it public anyway. As someone who knows what it&#39;s like to be different, and to be bullied relentlessly I too felt like it would never get better. But it did, and when it did I ran with it and never looked back. The people who mocked me soon wanted to date me and be a part of my life and I had the pleasure of being the bigger person.

So please, you will be the bigger and better person then those who bring you down. I know that depression is a disease that I hope to and probably will never understand, but know that I would feel honoured to know you and your life is worth it. The uniqueness you bring to the world is worth living for and I hope you can see it through regardless of the situation."

"event","So I should be studying for my French exam right now, but I'm here updating instead. Why? Because I studied for 5 hours yesterday and feel no further ahead. Sigh.. I'm kind of done with academia let me tell you. I mean, once I graduate I will have a Bachelors and an Advanced Diploma, but it's just getting SO tiring. Like I barely have the drive to care anymore..

Now it's time for something I haven't done in awhile, a sports rant.

I get that the Jays acquired a lot of talent over the past few weeks, and I get that they want to give them a chance to flex their muscles, but what I don't understand is why Travis Snider has to suffer??? I'm not just saying this because of his dashing good looks and awesome mustache, and sending him back to Triple A a month ago was completely legit.&nbsp; But even after proving himself, getting three hits and stealing a base in one game alone, you send him down AGAIN??? I don't get it. I really don't. It's got to be horrible for his self confidence, you're showing him that even when he has vast improvement he's still the first one to go down. Why not Hill or Lind? Who I've seen have much worse at bats than Snider in the last few games. Frustrating.

Anyway, I should probably study now. Hope Y'all have a great weekend! NKOTBSB&nbsp;BABY!"

I was pretty whatever about it as I've had some pretty crazy tests in my life and I figured this would be a piece of cake
I was fine until the person before me couldn't have his MRI because they weren't able to sedate him enough so he would be completely out cold. Then I got to thinking well why would he want to be asleep...it's just an MRI..
Then I found out..
I wasn't THAT&nbsp;freaked out as the technician was super nice and gave me John Mayer to listen too...it's just that the machine was so loud and the noises would change with each picture being taken...just very unsettling..now to see if there's anything wrong with my brain.

On another note....

WHAT THE FUCK is with players hitting my Stajy? Like seriously...he's the most non-threatening person and yet he seems to have a target on his back this season.

It saddens me to have to disown one of the Stall boys, but it must be done, what a disgusting hit..."

And the events that make me the most sad? Sports.

When Alyn McCauley got traded in that RIDICULOUS Owen Nolan trade TWO weeks after I bought my Jersey. He was the first Leaf I ever met and was the nicest guy about it.

:(...When my darling Matthew was traded. It was inevitable yes, but I still remember that heart breaking press conference, and it's just horrible. It still makes me incredibly sad

And now, Cito has left us. I can still vividly remember wearing Robbie Alamar's World Series at the age of 5. Most amazing thing ever.

And yes, he's said that before and we've flip flopped, but this time it just feels different..more real and I didn't think anything could hurt more than the first time he broke up with me, but it does. Four years of love and dedication and faith that everything would be okay to come to this.

Maybe it's for the better, maybe I can finally be free and move on, but that's what I think is haunting me. I don't know how to be alone. I was single for a year and a half before i met Andrew and he was such a ray of light in a dark, dark place.

My sadness with the Leafs pales in comparison to what Brian Burke must be going through, but I shall mention them anyway, starting with the worst first...

I can't believe his son is dead. i mean, I know i didn't know him or anything, but he was going to do so much good for the sports/world in general and then this happens. It just makes you wonder why, well me anyway.

Secondly, my beloved Matt Stajan has been traded. I knew it was coming, but this soon? Why now? Why ever? At least he got traded within canada and isn't THAT far, but *sigh*, watching hockey, or the Leafs for that matter just doesn't seem the same. Where's my number 14? Bah...at least I have Giguere to semi-love...*sigh*

I have one more to get back, and unfortunately it's the one I fear the most. The prof is completely unreadable and it also doesn't help that he pretty much hates the class because we never participate, but that's because he shoots us down every time we do, so who knows.

They haven't announced any dates yet, but I'm so excited to let loose and mosh my life away:D<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder about me and my music tastes. I mean a Jason Mraz concert made me appreciate life and I was all super happy and now thinking of a Three Days Grace concert, I can't wait to yell and scream about how much life can suck.<br /><br />You guys really need to give this album a serious listen. It's called Life Starts Now.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

Three Days Grace, Michael Buble, BSB!!!!! SO HAPPY! And even though I've heard most of BSB's album having all the singles makes me EEEE!!!. It's so funny how all three songs are oppisites of each other, but I love them all equally. Right now I am relating heavily to Michael's single, but I'll have those lyrics at the end of this entry for your enjoyment:)<br /><br />First things first, THE LEAFS. I actually got to watch the pregame tonight. Do I dare say that we might actually make the play offs this year? I just have one simple question and maybe somebody *cough cough** Stacey can help me out....Where the F&nbsp;did Jason Allison come from and why is he on our team??????? Agh! GO LEAFS GO!!!

My new roomate Pauline had me listening to it at first and man now I can't stop listening. My other two roomies are prolly really annoyed by now. Ah wells.<br /><br />As some of you may or may not know I moved to Waterloo to attend what I am learning to be one of the greatest universities ever. I mean I guess I'm bias because it's the ONLY one I've ever been to, but they just make you feel so loved and part of something so much bigger than yourself it's amazing, I moved into my new place on Sept. 1 and it definitely took some adjusting to, but it'[s starting to feel more and more like home.the first week was a rough one, I was the only one here and I just missed home so much, but once Frosh started all was good.<br /><br />Frosh was AMAZING. i met so many amazing people and learned so many crazy cheers I'm soooo happy I went to almost everything. And because of this Sean Kingston's song Fire burnin will never be the same to me again haha. I love you arts and especially my AP&nbsp;DRAGONS!!!!!<br /><br />I'm not sure why but i decided to update to try and keep my mind off the fact that I feel like absoulute shit emotionally right now. I'm not sure what happened. I just feel like poop and writing always helps. I seem to be having deep and meaningful conversations with so many people these days. the thing I hate though is that the next day it seems like nothing happened or was accomplished. I don't know what I'm expecting to happen, but I feel such a strong connection and then nothing. I don't like it at all.<br /><br />That aside I have so many wonderful things to look forward to:<ul><li>NEW THREE DAYS GRACE ALBUM SEPTEMBER 22!</li><li>SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE AT THE ACC SEPTEMBER 29</li><li>!!! THE LEAFS SEASON OPENER...HELLS TO THE YES OCTOBER 1</li><li>NEW BSB CD OCTOBER 6</li></ul>EEEEEEEEE!<br /><br />Must stay positive.&nbsp; I am really super excited for classes to start and for me not to get lost when venturing off ring road please please pleaaaaase!<br /><br />"

Zak and I really wanted to go because we love Mark Forward We saw him at the Ajax Yuk Yuks a few weeks ago, and then when we saw that it was him AND Jon Dore we just couldn't pass it up. We got there a few hours early so we decided to find somewhere to eat. After walking down Queen street (towards the Rivoli) and after Zak pointing out every sushi restaurant on the way there that I did not want to go to haha, we decided to just eat at the Rivoli.

The burger I had there was SO good. We still had like an hour and a half before the show so we thought we'd try to get in early. And we did, and we got to see the behind the scenes to the JOn Dore Show. It was so epic. It makes me so sad to think that show is cancelled. Replaced by Keys to the VIP....SERIOUSLY? Man...

To explain how funny the whole night was would be impossible. but all you need to know is that it was absoulutely amazing.

To top the night off we're on the bus on the way home and this 80 year old woman's phone rings and all you hear is...&quot;you spin my head right round, right round when you go down, when you go down, down...&quot; I could not stop laughing.

Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed this random update. I'm sorry I don't update more, I just don't have any motivation. I really do enjoy ready your entries though:)"

"event","So it looks as though I haven't updated in over a month and I figured if I'm stuck inside anyway, I might as well make an actual update.<br /><br />My last few entries have certainly been somewhat vague/depressing, but that's because I didn't really know how to explain how I was feeling, and what I could understand, was random anyway. To make an extremely long and complicated story short Andrew and I broke up for about a months time. It was hard to say we were broken up though when absolutely nothing between us had changed except for our title.&nbsp; This is was obviously not getting us anywhere so I confronted him about it and decided to start moving on as best I could. During this time I learned a lot about myself and gained a lot of strength. The thought of losing me forever, however, terrified Andrew and we are now back together. I know it's the right thing. I love him more than anything and I think we're both happier than we've ever been, so yay! So much for a short story eh?<br /><br />In other news, I still don't have a steady job and I'm feeling the effects of it. Living on a very tight budget is definitely interesting. I'm almost out of debt though and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />The Leafs. Oh the Leafs. I didn't think it was possible, but Vesa Toskala actually aggravates me more than Andrew Raycroft did. He does not seem to understand the concept of guarding the entire net. Bah. And it also helps a goalie when he has you know, DEFENCE! Man, I can hardly watch the games anymore because they pain me so. I'm going to the Leafs&nbsp; Skate on feb. 16 and if Vesas on my skate, god help him. Other than the Staj meister I have no problem viocing my opinios to the players haha.<br /><br />Between the combination of mass amounts of snow and strep throat I've barely been able to leave the condo and it sucks. Then again, I don't where I'd go, but hey, just having the option would be great. Oh the joys of living in Canada, not that I'd live anywhere else. Woo juniors!:D So on my day of staying in I've decided to listen to BSB, man I love them. Their new album is set for 2010 and holy shiz I'm so excited. It'll also be interesting to see what Nick's new solo CD is going to sound like compared to Now or Never as it was pretty much crap haha.<br /><br />But I just realized this entry has been one big rambling so when I have more intersting things to talk about I shall post!<br /><br />Ahh!

You are the love of my life and the man I want to marry.

It's almost impossible for me to comprehend that you want to abandon everything me had because you're going to be super busy with school and it's really not fair to me. In a way it's not, butI'm willing to do it. After everything we've been through, you're going to say goodbye cause everything is getting just a little tougher? Why?

Or is there something else? I know there's no other woman because I know you, and you would never do that. But I feel like there's something you're not telling me.

Can Monday at 5 come any slower?

I love you. Please don't do this."

Ever since that first day I saw them when I was 12 I made some sort of connection with them and that connection has lasted until this very day and probably for the rest of my life. I know they're silly boy band who maybe write a fifth of their songs, but they are talented, they can sing and play instruments and with the ""musicians"" that are around these days that's saying a lot. They are also just generally amazing people. I first met nick in 2001 when I went to see him at Much Music. I had no intention of even getting in the building, but his security guard got my front row centre and Nick even spent 5 minutes with me to talk and that was one of the happiest days of my life. When I met the rest of the boys (minus A.J) in..maybe 2004? They all took the time to talk with me and even though they probably hear the same stories and meet thousands of fans every day, they still made me feel special and appreciated. I know from meeting other celebrities that there is no way I would be given the same courtesy. I know this is like an insane rant but I just had to get it out. I'm going to see them in concert in two days and I can't even put into words how excited I am. So say what you will, but I truly respect them as people and musicians and if you don't like it well read another journal!<br /><br /><br /><div text=""To the boys..."" class=""ljcut"">When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul <br /> When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control <br /> When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know <br /> You still care for me, say a prayer for me, and I know <br /> <br /> Oooh, I like you hangin' around <br /> 'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down <br /> Oooh, you are my favorite sound <br /> 'Cause you're always down for <br /> <br /> Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground <br /> Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down <br /> Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low <br /> When your arms are around me <br /> I don't wanna let you go <br /> <br /> When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day <br /> And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load <br /> And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity <br /> Would you hold my hand? <br /> Say you understand my pain <br /> <br /> Oooh, I like you hangin' around <br /> 'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down <br /> Oooh, you are my favorite sound<br /> 'Cause you're always down for<br /> <br /> Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground <br /> Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down <br /> Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low <br /> When your arms are around me <br /> I don't wanna let you go <br /> <br /> It's been a long hard road, and it's only just begun, my friend <br /> And this I know<br /> You helped me carry the load <br /> 'Cause you're always down for <br /> <br /> Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground <br /> Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down <br /> Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low <br /> Well, you're always around <br /> You're my favourite sound <br /> <br /> Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground <br /> Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down <br /> Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low <br /> When your arms are around me <br /> I don't wanna let you go <br /> <br /> I don't wanna let you go <br /> 'Cause you lift me up now <br /> Well, you're always around.. <br /> You're my favorite sound <br /> Lift me up now <br /> You lift me up <br /> Lift me up now <br /> Yeah, you're always around <br /> You're my favourite sound <br /> <br /> Lift me up </div>"

"event","Well hello there all!!

Andy pointed out to me that it has indeed been a LONG time since I've updated. Of course a lot has been going on in my life, but I'll just highlight the main points.

I graduated. Holy shit. I don't know if I'm ready to not be a student anymore. I guess it all has to do with moving on with life and becoming an adult, but I'm fighting it. I've applied to about12 or so jobs and have only had one interview with no result, but I don't really feel discouraged because I know this is going to be a slow process and when the right opportunity comes, I'll know it. I'm also going to really miss Humber and all the people in it. My teachers and classmates really taught me a lot and after all my doubts on whether or not I chose the right program, I know I did.

The Leafs. Oh boy, so much has been changing and for some reason I just can't get motivated to care. I mean if Stajan gets traded I will wage war on MLSE, but other than that I see it as a positive thing that so many players are leaving. I'll miss Tucker, but him and his crew (especially Raycrap) need to go. Although the worst of all the seeds in my opinion is still on the team. McCabe. Why not buy him out and take his money and give it to someone who is actually useful. Just a thought. As far as Ron Wilson goes I have mixed feelings. I honestly don't know THAT much about him. I just read Damien Cox's article about him, and how he is not exactly ""media friendly"", which kind of pisses me off because it could be me interviewing him one day and if he's a prick to me, he better watch out!

Andrew and I are doing well considering all the stuff that's going on in his life right now. I'm not going to get into obviously because it's very personal, but I&nbsp; think it just shows us how strong our relationship is. There are times when it seemed like it was unbearable, but I'm still here and so is he and I still love him with all I am, so we must be doing something right!&lt;3"

"event","So I haven' posted in what? 4months? Yeah well nobody told me that I would have absoulutely NO free time during my final year in Humber'sjournalism program. At times it's frustrating when all I want to do is relax for a few days, but for the most part it makes me feel as though I've truly accomplished something. I'm the news editor of the HUmber Et Cetera from Mon-Wed and I work at Toronto Community News on Thurs and Fri.

It's a strange power trip being on charge of reporters and then on Thurs and Fridays going back to being at the bottom of the journalism totem pole. I write briefs and the occasional stories. 3 of which I've gotten published. It's a pretty damn good feeling.

I also won the Toronto Star Award for best overall contribution to the Humber Et Cetera. BOO YEAH!

There were two main reasons I wanted to update though

1. The new BSB CD is AMAZING. I'm not just saying that because I've been a fan for 11 years, it really is amazing.&nbsp; I love their new sound and although Kevin will be missed they do just fine without me. The songs are all pretty depressing though, no Backstreet's Back-esque songs. Something tells me either Nick or Howie got the hearts brokeded...:*(

2. The Leafs.....*sigh*.....I didn't think it could get worse, but it has. I hate them, and I hate the fact that despite hating them I still love them dearly. Two things need to happen: Maurice, fired. Fergueson, Fired. So siimple.

MICHAEL BUBLE ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! I love you Andrew Blakey!

And some BSB lyrics for your reading pleasure:

  		How come I was the last to know
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting sunday afternoon 
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
And the people walkin' by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow (oh yeah)
How decidedly my life has changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go.

And I miss your face

Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

No, Oh Baby
This sweet relief
Unexpected things
Is this the end or only the beginning

I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes (Like the afternoon)
And now I'm running blind (running blind)
And I can't explain (can't explain)
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon

"event","I'm in a very music-y mood, and when I'm in this mood I feel the need to write. I'm just in one of those moods where I can go from Eminem to Jason Mraz and I love it. Just dancing and singing and enjoying all types of music without being my usual picky self. In the words of Mr. Mraz ""Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head?"" Cause I know I'm not:P Haha.

I've also taken interest in improving my Spanish, and of course, Josh Groban has come to the rescue, Even though he sings in Italian (I think), they're so insanely similar that it still has the same effect.

In terms of my life, not much is new really, I quit my job at Beck Taxi because the stress of it was giving me a million sicknesses at once and I also have a few medical appointments coming up. I just feel better overall not working there. I DO have my interview with the Scarborough Mirror on Monday. I'm so nervous. I know I have no reason to be. But being an actual (unpaid) reporter, is just so amazingly and wonderfully intimadating.

Adam Carolla. I always liked him ever since Andrew introduced me, well kinda, a year back, but now it seems to have reached a whole different level. I look forward to his radio show every day and really respect what the man has to say. Not to mention he's absoulutely hilarious in a horrible way har har. Bonnaduce needs to get over his wife or ex-wife or get lost and I'm still warming up to Theresa.

Anyways I'm done with this post of Randomness.

Andrew Blakey, I'll always be your Meggie. And if you didn't have all your moods, you wouldn't be you, and then I couldn't love you nearly as much. You're peerfect. I miss you and in the words of Josh Groban, ""Solo por ti"". Only for you."

"event","<p>It's been what almost 4 months since I updated? There has definately been a lot going on ans to spare anyone who actually reads this the agony, I'll give you the condensed version hehe.<br /><br />I moved back home in April and survived Semester 4 with flying colours. Coming home was a bit rocky at the beginning, but I'm settled in now and quite happy to be home. Didn't really do much until mid May really. Andrew and I celebrated our one year anniversary on the 19th. We celebrated with the usaual Meggie and Andrewness and I honestly fell deeper in love with him. I just feel as though we've reached a point in our relationship of higher understanding that most people don't reach in a lifetime and regardless of what life throws at me I'll always have us and that's such an amazing feeling. You're stuck with me my love:P<br /><br />It was also around this time that I started training for my job at Beck Taxi. I did a lot better than I thought I would., but after about 10 shifts or so, along with medical issues I felt as though the job wasnt for me. This Sunday was supposed to be my last day, but I was diagnosed with Pink eye today so yeah, no more work for me:P<br /><br />That's&nbsp; another thing. I seem to be getting a string of infections lately. Nothing too earth shattering, but enough to be a nuicense I'll say that much. Let's hope that this Pink Eye is the nail in my infectious coffin.<br /><br />I'm probab;y going to be spending the rest of the summer relaxing and spending time with the man I love and that makes me incredibly happy. My internship is also pretty much a go for September which is amazing.<br /><br />It just as feels as though, despite all the bumps along the way, my life, in every aspect, is finally heading where it should be.<br /><br />Oh and where would this update be without hockey??<br /><br /><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""5"">HAHAHAHAH<br /><br />SENATORS CHOKED HAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br /><br /><br /><font size=""1"">enough said.<br /><br /><font color=""#3366ff"" size=""3"">""Our friends all make fun of us and we'll just laugh along because we know that know of them have felt this way.

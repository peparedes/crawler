"event","Due to having this LJ which I only recently began updating again, my website, and my Vox account - I'll probably only post here for the Friday Fives.&nbsp; t is an idea for a post every time, and it is not an obligation at all to do so.&nbsp; So, here is my Friday Five for May 30, 2008.<br /><b><br /><font size=""3"">""With the following phrases, post a single image of the strongest thought/idea that pops into your head.""&nbsp; (<font size=""1"">I can't say I used a single image.&nbsp; The idea was just too good not to elaborate</font><i><font size=""1"">.<font size=""3"">)</font></font></i></font><br /><br />1.) Favorite Food:&nbsp; </b>Mexican food by far.&nbsp; I can eat a few bowls of salsa with no problem, I should probably own stock in Taco Bell at this point in my life, and for an Irish chick I can cook the hell out of some Mexican dishes.<br /><b><br />2.) Least Favorite Food:&nbsp; </b>I cannot stand beans (I only eat green beans).&nbsp; Lima beans, red beans (I will eat red beans &amp; rice cooked <b>only</b> by my Mother), white beans, black eyed peas, and peas.&nbsp; I can stand peas in vegetable soup, but eww.&nbsp; I don't know what it is about beans I do not like, but I have no been able to eat the little suckers my entire life.&nbsp; Ya ya, they're good for my heart - I'm a smoker.&nbsp; That went out the window two and a half years ago.<br /><b><br />3.) Favorite Thing:&nbsp; </b>My laptop.&nbsp; It's my seven pound transportable life line.&nbsp; My journal.&nbsp; My route to the Sims 2.&nbsp; My photo album.&nbsp; I've been dependent on a computer since I was a child.&nbsp; I have a <b>BEAST</b> of a laptop too.&nbsp; Love my 2 gigs and wireless Internet (cannot wait to update it!).<br /><b><br />4.) Least Favorite Thing:&nbsp; </b>Rudeness.&nbsp; There are some things you should say and some thing you should just keep to your self.&nbsp; I do agree that ""opinions are like assholes"", but when did common decency go out the window?&nbsp; I'm too much of an optimist to go around being rude to everyone.&nbsp; Life is short.&nbsp; Don't leave this Earth being the bitch everyone hated.&nbsp; Make as many friends as possible.&nbsp; In my short almost 24 years, my life has been in many places.&nbsp; My friends helped me through things I normally wouldn't be able to handle on my own.<br /><b><br />5.) A phobia:&nbsp; </b>When I was seven years old some boys thought it would be funny to trap me in the middle of a McDonald's play ground slide.&nbsp; By in the middle I mean there were at least three boys in front and also behind me making it so I could not move either way in the slide.&nbsp; Ever since then I have been afraid of tight spaces.&nbsp; Of course, being in a holding cell for 36 hours did not get to me, but being in a haunted house and having the ceiling start going down (I'm tall!) on me almost made me cry.&nbsp; My Mom is the same way though - and she doesn't like cheese.&nbsp; Weirdo.<br /><b><br />6.) An addiction:&nbsp; </b>At this point in my life I would have to say it is Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.&nbsp; I own at least seven of the shows on DVD, I DVR every Adult Swim show that is not anime, and if I am home at that point in the evening (always up but not always home) I am watching it on TV.&nbsp; The bar around the corner from my work keeps Cartoon Network on after 10 pm.&nbsp; I'm usually in there after 1am, and I am always watching the TV with the cartoons on it.&nbsp; Can you blame me?&nbsp; I love to laugh!"

And today is my last day in my department at work.  The powers that be decided to take me off of my Sup. duty and give me my own department for a new client project.  BONG!  No more talking to complete retards!  I mean, um, fuck it!  Fuck those child worshiping motherfuckers!  I'M RICH BITCH!

"event","Yesterday my old boss came over to my house with her sister.  She's a pretty good friend of mine these days, though putting my hand through that wall in a controlled rage kinda scared the shit outta her.  We watched The Dark Half.  Not really her kind of movie, but this is a person who doesn't really dig on watchin movies anyway.  When she noticed that the DVD collection grew by about sixty since she was last at the house she noted how boys love their toys.  Awww, a cliche.  Isn't it sweet?  To which I simply replied, ""So, the fuck, what?!""
     See, it doesn't take much to get me goin.  Anyhoo, she tried to correct herself by trying to take away the offense.  Thing is, I wasn't really offended, I just wanted to know what of it.  So what if I have an obscene amount of entertainment.  I used to have just as many books at one point.  It's not that I'm uneducated, lord knows I've read damn near every important piece of English and American literature.  Too bad most of it sucked butt except for Milton and Frankenstein.  And even Milton was pushin it.  
     I tried explaining to her that my movies was all that I had...next to my video games and comic books and beer and cigarettes :-)
     She asked what about my girlfriend.  ""Like I said, my DVD's are all I love!""  Sorry, cheap shot.  It really doesn't matter what you spend your money on, as long as what you buy makes you happy.  Psychologicly, money is just a secondary reinforcement anyway.  It's what you can get with the money that matters.  Outside of another great game or movie or book, what else do I need that I don't have?  Oh yeah, food.  I've got a great apartment, comfy couches and chairs, and a huge bed.  Yep, that pretty much sums up what I need.  So, from there, it's all about what I want.  She asked me what about a partner that I can share my life with.  To which I replied, ""Shh, after Batman.""  Yes, I do love to dodge dumb questions.  Truth be told, I've only ever loved but one woman with all of my entirity.  Or, in other words, there's only been one chick who really really did it for me.  She'd like to take long romantic walks down the horror section of Best Buy, she'd kick my ass at literally every video game that either of us owned, and she was just as practical as I was.  Alas, she's MARRIED and I passed up on the chance for her to run away with me.  Morality blows.  I gave up on it that day and switched over to ethics.  When that didn't work, I just created my own morals and convinced myself that I'm right and everyone else who disagrees is blatantly wrong.  That didn't take long.  I just turned on the news and saw some really fucked up shit I like to call 'society'.  Yeah, its scary.
     Wow, did I just digress from the point or what?  Shit.  Anyhoo, the point of the story was, yes, me and my toys.  I like toys and I and I love to play with them.  Might make a good dad one day.  However, in regarding to ""boys and their toys"" my only defense to her was, ""My toys say 'bleep', 'boop', 'bam' and 'ka-blowie!'; your's just go 'bzzzzzzz'.  
     I rest my case."

This amused me in many ways.I like it!!
(Reply to this)
 
Well, Amy, darlin, I aim to please.  Sadly, somehow all this crazy shit that people can usually dream up usually ends up happening to me.  To which my usual lament is, ""I swear to god, dude, I'm bein fuckin punished for somethin"".  But you know what, I can't complain really.  Given that I'm Irish, all that's really important to me (besides beer) is a damned good story.  Granted, the only kind that turn me on are horror stories (Go Clive Barker!) but if you can tell TRUE stories of some sick shit that actually happened to you, well, you'll be damned interesting forever.  Most of my stories no one would believe anyway, so, I keep those reserved.  In highschool I'd always somehow end up finding myself in trouble with friends in the weirdest situations, and we'd always come out on top of things.  It's just the way things work out for me.  Kinda handy if you think about it.
     I got to watch one of my new movies yesterday, without my girlfriend showing up....well, she did, but I lied and said that I was going out to my ranch, so she left.  I got to sit and enjoy the glory that is The Fly!  Jeff Goldbloom kicks ass.  How fuckin cool would it be to waste someone by yaking on them?!  I mean, one, you get to off some fuckwit, and, two, you get to off him in the most humiliating way next to peeing on him!  Maybe it's just me?  Who cares.  This girl I'm dating....sigh....if she wasn't so damned annoying with self pitty all the time, she'd crack me up.  She thinks that I'm this great glorious person.  I'm not, I'm just the first guy to treat her with a little respect and not beat the christ out of her.  So, I guess to her that makes me Charlton Fuckin Heston.  Anyhoo, she tries to be like me, and fails miserably.  For example, I'm not one for church or church goers.  I just simply don't have a need for it in my life.  Not to say that I don't dig on god or anything, I just don't care.  I don't like people in general, let alone egotistic, elitist, pretentious pricks that think that they're going to earn their plot of land by forming their little cult once a week.  Anyhoo, she takes her kid to church every week.  I think that's fairly healthy if the munchkin digs it.  Just cause it ain't good for me, doesn't mean the kid won't learn nothin.  So she tells me yesterday, ""Well, I literally feel ill every time I go to church.""  We have a word for people like that: POSER!
     I'm not technicly goth.  I don't dress completely in black and I hate buttrock.  However, spiritually, I've always been the mold breaker.  I'm just a dark person (I'm fuckin bi-polar, waddaya want?) and synical to boot.  But at least I'm funny:-)  I just can't stand it when people want to change themselves to fit in.  This gal, if she got over herself, could really go somewhere in life.  But, her only direction, only possible direction, is down.  She tries so hard to be liked and well, she just looks stupid doin it.  Sorry.  But I'd never lie to my readers.  People should just be themselves and revel in that.  Cause everyone can do somethin better than other people.  I know what you're all thinkin: Kev, if this chick is so fuckin out there, what are you doin with her?  Well my loves, it's very simple, see, if I dump her, she'll freak out at my job and get my ass fired.  And remember, everyone gets their come uppins, and all good things come to those who wait.  Besides, when have you ever known me to be without a good back up plan.  Every story teller needs a good punchline; and I'm never without."

"event","This getting up at three in the morning sucks more ass than a cheap pornstar from Toledo.  My coffee pot sucks, and I have no pepsi.  Having to kickstart my ticker with an extra few doses of nicotine is costly.  But, what I DO have to get me going, is watchin The Muppet Show first thing in the morning.  Yeah, I know, sounds dumb and gay.  Well fuck you then!  Animal rocks.  
     I realized something when I was talking to my best friend yesterday.  The fact that my family is embarassed and ashamed of me is common knowledge, which is funny because I figured out, we've actually got a whole lot in common.  They all pretty much look down on my insanity as a sign that I'm not close enough or ""Strong"" enough with God.  Which is slightly ironic since most insane people think that they see god or ARE god.  But just a brief background of what I'm getting at.  My dad, was a cop for twenty years.  Now he's a soldier; just got back from Bosnia.  My brother, is a Marine; just got back from Iraq.  Needless to say, the sun shines out their asses on a cloudy day.  And then there's the oldest son: ME :-)  The good looking and brilliant one.  My dad and brother are perceived as heroes obviously, as they've killed people in the name of freedom.  I won't go into my reasons for doing things, but just rest assured that I had some pretty damn good reasons to abandon my hunanity.  Whenever we go anywhere, we get dinner bought for us if dad is wearing his uniform.  Not that we look for that, it just happens.  And, when it does, my mom has to tell the whole story on how she and dad got divorced, remarried, then he got sent to Bosnia and her son got sent to Iraq.  When that happens it never fails that someone comes up and gives ME a hug and a strong ""pleased to meet ya"" handshake.  Then some saucy tart will ask me how long I've been home, to which my usual reply is ""Since one o'clock"".  Well, that's what time I got off work.  I ain't lyin to the bitch.  At that point my mom says, ""Oh, no, this is our other son.""  Yeah, that feels really great.
     So, I'm the crazy, philosophical poet.  BFD.  Fuck 'em if that can't take a joke, and joke 'em if they can't take a fuck!  The thing is though, heroism kinda runs in the family, and the family fails to see, that I'm probably the biggest hero in the family.  No, this isn't a horn tooting session.  My dad and brother, though I love em, enlisted to prove a point.  Dad wanted to be john wayne, and sean wanted to be dad.  Fair enough.  Me?  If there's gonna be any blastin goin on, it's gonna be just ME.  Ok, back to the point.  Out of all the babies that I've saved, and there has been a handful, people I've stopped from walking into an intersection at a wrong time, theives that I've helped catch, and yes, even pulling my old man out of a pit of brambles and poison oak, I think I rate somewhere on the list as a selfless giver.  I mean, shit, I've only been reading Batman for twenty years!  I'm almost twenty six, so I don't want to make myself sound too old.  
     Ultimately, I like offending people.  It makes me giggle.  So, the next time someone mistakes you for someone that they think is admirable, play it out, let that person look stupid!  Why?  Cause fuck 'em that's why!  And if you ever have any doubts, just remember one thing: You graduated grade school and don't have to take shit from anyone :-)"

"event","My hellish, but wonderful job has had me busting my ass for two weeks straight.  Now, even though I'm usually sitting on my ass most of the day crunchin on sunflower seeds (protein), I have to deal with every single stupid, childworshiping parent in the united states and canada.  That's pretty stressful on it's own; mix my evening staff into the equasion, and you've got the Dragon wanting to take a nap instead of break shit come one pm.  So, FINALLY, a day off.  I decided to go out to my family's ranch and just hang out with my dad and watch some horror films all day....or at least as many as he could handle, which is usually two in a day (pussy).  Dad, on the other hand, figures it's a great day to rip out and burn black berry bushes.  Now, I don't want anyone to think that I'm lazy, but I am seriously opposed to manual labor.  Why?  Cause, it fuckin sucks!  That's why.  I'd rather be playin video games; y'know, important shit like saving galaxies.  Or watchin horror films while screamin, ""Yeah!  Tear her heart out!""  (If only).  
     Anyhoo, so yeah, I got stuck rumaging around through brambles and poison oak.  The poison oak doesn't bother me so much since I'm immune to it (Yay for the crazy guy!)  But it's those damned brambles.  Why in fuck's name would I want to scrape the shit outta myself.  Listen, just cause a 140lb. guy can painlessly put his hand through two walls, doesn't make him a masochist.  Besides, didn't anyone see Evil Dead.  Call me superstisious, but, I just don't think I'm down to get strangled by some shit like that.  So, the hack and slash worked out just fine.  My dad's determination and macho self ego kept him going, and my brilliance to find an easier way kept me going.  I decided that since we were going to start a control burn, I might as well celebrate with my own nicotine control burn.  So, as I'm walkin away, my dad is standing over this pit that we'd filled up full of brambles.  I light my smoke, and he's not their anymore.  All I could hear was a very painful thrashing sound.  Apparently, the Pillsburry Doughboy decided to walk too close to the edge of the pit and the lip gave way, crumbled and dropped my pappy straight into the pit of the thorns.  Not good.  Dad wasn't all the way down at the bottom of the pit, and the more he tried to move to get himself out, the more his sank.  Dipshit.  After pulling him out (without cutting him further)I told him that I never ever wanted to hear another negative word about my comic books!  
     Lets see, soon after that, I was charged by a bull.  Yeah, that was a hoot.  Could you believe it, the bull LOST!  Ha!  In your face Strawberry!  Thing is, bulls are fast and bulky, but the bulky part means that they don't slow down too gracefully.  I don't know what I did to piss that big fucker off, but after I jumped outta his way, he found out what I try to tell all the time:  There's always something bigger and better.....like an OAK TREE!
Knocked that mother fucker right the hell out!
     Alas, the day ended with me living out one of the items on my ""Things To Do Before I Die"" list.  I built my very own:  FLAME THROWER!!!!!!!  A real one too!  I had my x-metals on with an ear to ear smile, nuking all the brambles that nearly eveserated my dad.  It brought a tear to my eye, and a thickness to my crotch.  Yes, there ARE things that are far better than sex.  The Dragon breathed FIRE!"

"event","Well, the Dragon's latest resurrection came to, what I hope, an abrupt close yesterday.  I had two days of silence.  Quite nice, actually.  I dig on the sounds of silence.  However, before I decided to put the demon to rest for the time being, one last shabang was in order.  Once I got home from work, I began my usual day of beer and He-Man.  I've got like three more discs to get through before the next boxed set comes out.  But, I wasn't quite feeling satisfied.  I figured I could watch Batman: Mask of The Phantasm, cause I love Mark Hamill's Joker.  Nah, watched that earlier this week.  Perhaps the episode of The Flash where Mark Hamill plays the Trickster (where he's basicly doing his Joker voice in live action).  Nah, watched that this week too.  Well shit on it all!  What to do, what to do?  Ah ha!  I'll go get the first three boxed sets of Batman: The Animated Series!  ShaZam!  Seemed like a good idea to me.  Besides, I hadn't seen my friend Carol in a while.  She manages the Sam Goody in this shit hole, er, town.  While I was arriving at the mall, going down a one way lane in the parking lot.  Some toothless chica comes roaring down the lane towards me and screeches her breaks and is honking her horn at me.  Let me say now, I hate rude people.  
     I pull to the ""far"" side of the lane as best as I could, ya know, to be a gentleman and stuff.  And this tart rolls down her window and pulls up parallel to me and shouts at me, ""Why don't you take up both lanes you fuckin MORON!""  All I could really do was raise an eyebrow at her from behind my shades.  What a curious word to use on someone who didn't even know or care that they were going the wrong way.  I could have just waved and said sorry for being a ""moron"" or I could do something more fun.  Lemme tell ya people, there's nothing in life worth doin, if it ain't fun!  I took a peek as to where she was parking and decided I should go double check to make sure that she really called me a moron.
     As she was getting out of her car, she turned around and looked up at me.  Yeah, looked up, and I'm only five-seven.  ""Excuse me, was it 'moron' that you called me back there?""
     ""What the fuck do you think, you fuckin jerk?""
     ""Well, I was just curious as to make sure before I told you that,"" Here's where the fun picks up, ""THE NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE TO USE A WORD AT SOMEONE, MAKE SURE YOUR STUPID ASS ISN'T GOING DOWN A LANE IN THE WRONG FUCKIN DIRECTION, YOU STUPID, TOOTHLESS, FUCKIN TWEEKER ASSED, CUNT!""
     At this point she made the wise decission to get back into her car, and skip her trip into the mall.  Malls are made for decent folk, like consumers and Mallrats.  Not tweekers.  And that was the end of the anger.  Tucked back inside, and ready to go DVD shopping...ah, DVD's:  God's gift to mankind.  Well, that and contraceptives :-)
     So, instead of a Beer and He-Man night, I had a kickin Beer and Batman night.  Pleasant little change of pace.  
     And, when I got home, the roomie was there with his cousin and his auntie.  Ah, God is good, I get to drink, watch Batman cartoons that I hadn't seen since I was a kid AND grease someone all in the same afternoon!  Sometimes, I wonder why I doubt the lord.  That was a joke.  Anyhoo, the positive news was, the roomie was moving his shit out.  And I got to sit on the couch, piece in lap, beer in hand watching his cousin and his aunt at my back door looking quite nervous and waiting for the roomie to hand them things to pack into the truck.  Finally, someone listens.  Sigh...and people, let me give you some advice if anyone tries to threaten you with a gun.  Before you get scared, make sure that it isn't a squirt gun :-)"

I tell ya, after this last week, it doesn't get any better than getting drunk off your ass and watching 23 year old episodes of He-Man and Night Court.  As it is right now, last night blew nuts.  Nothing really bad happened, except for the power going out in the middle of the night and freezing my nuts off.  Yow.  At first I thought someone was fuckin with me cause everyone else had power near me that I could see.  I was half tempted to ask my neighbor if I could sleep in front of her heater, but, after a cigarette or two the power kicked back on and back to sleep I went.  Until I started having dreams about my ex-fiance.  Sigh....why is it always the people that fuck us up the most are the ones that we miss the most.  Probably because I liked entertaining the idea that a beautiful woman could love me and want to spend the rest of her life with me.  I dunno, didn't sound all that harsh at the time.  Time for work"

"event","He gave my number to the fuckin police.  I'm sorry, but where I come from, no matter how you get pinched, you never ever fuck with people who are or try to be your friends.
     This long night made for a hellacious day at work.  Projects upon projects to work on.  Not enough caffiene in the blood.  Staff that wants their break schedules when I can barely even think beyond wanting to pound someone into the fuckin floor so hard that they piss blood all over themselves.  Oh, yeah, and my fuckin hand finally started to hurt.  But, alas, the work day did end, as it always does.  Went to my cave wanting nothing more than alcohol and a nice long nap.  At this point I think my ideal nap time would be....oh, FOREVER.  Unfortunately, the family then called, wanting me to go to dinner with them.  Hadn't really eatin much this week so I figured, what the fuck, free food, more booze, I'm a happy dude.  Well, wasn't quite happy enough.  When I got home, I had this horrible hankering in the back of my mind.  I needed fuel for my spirit.  I was roaring inside despite my exhaustion and fatigue.  I fumbled for my keys after watching my parents drive out of my driveway and, clumsily, raced for my car!  Sped accross town to Fred Meyers (it's like Target or Wal-Mart) and greedily picked up Saw 2, MirrorMask and He-Man vol. 2.  Fuck you!  He-Man gave birth to the free world!  Came back home, less than carefully, thanked me for flying me-airways hoping that me enjoyed another stupid bout of drinking and driving for the sake of DVD's, watched Saw2, teary eyed at that.  It's fuckin beautiful!  
     Decided to drink some more and stay up to watch MirrorMask, despite the fact that I had to get up at three to go to work.  Around 8:30 I decided to go to sleep.  I was appeased.  Wasn't feeling too evil at all.  For lack of better term, I was content.  Then, just as I was closing my eyes, the fuckin phone rings.  Who could it be?  Gasp!  It's my old pal, the dingus room mate.  And, who was he with?  Not his loyal girlfriend.  No, no.  He was with his tweeker aunt, out of town to avoid the cops.  BAM, insta-rage.  I can put up with a lot of shit; however, there are two types of people that I hate in this world: Liars, and people who bitch about their problems when they perpetually create and lust after their problems.  
     At this point, I became very very very very tired of this shit.  All I wanted was peace.  I don't like being annoyed by people who say that they hate someone one moment, and then go hang out with them the next.  His girlfriend and I used to be very good friends.  She used to be my boss.  That was the only reason why he was/is at my house.  Out of that respect.  I tried talking to her to calm myself down, call it needing to hear a rational voice.  Well, when I called her his loyal girlfriend, I meant just what I said.   She too thinks that I'm paranoid and insane.  Well, I mean, I am, but....shut up, you know what I mean.  She yelled at me that it wasn't his fault that the cops have my number.  I asked her if they magically  removed it from his brain.  Apparently, where these people come from, it's totally cool, AND justified, to fuck another person by doing the exact opposite of what they wish.  My wishes are very simple: Leave. Me. The. Fuck. Alone!  It's a very simple  equasion: sick, demented, psychotic (yet hansome) hermit plus doesn't like people plus people equals EVIL PISSED OFF, sick demented psychotic (yet hansom) hermit.  So, I decided it was time to play the game by my rules.  I've gone along with enough shit in my time to know that this is not one of those fun adventures that I care to go along with.  Nuh, uh.  No sireebob!  So, I used my final warning to everyone.  I told them all that I wanted to play a little game with them.  A game to help them evolve and grow passed the nothingness that they're degrading themselves too.  I told them that this game is going to help them leave me alone.  There are four people in this town, those four people are following four other people that I have selected for this game.  The rules are simple.  If any of the four people whom I have selected as players come near me, contact me or have someone else do the same, then someone that they love or care for is going to be hurt.  Badly.  I decided it was time to wake up, roar and amuse myself with the woes of bad people.  I can talk and talk and talk and talk, but these people aren't satisfied with talk, they have to make it so I have to teach them.  Hurting them won't fix anything; hurting the one's that they love?  Now, that makes people march to the band.
     Everything's been nice and quiet since.  Douche called yesterday, with his auntie, and tried to be just like her.  Being really nice, though blatantly faking it, even if you're not a fuckin psychic or a genius.  The funny thing was though, he thought that he really sounded nice.  They wanted to come over to visit.  She wanted to meet me and apologize for the horrible way that she's treated me. AND, they also wanted to know if I wanted to go spend the night out at her place.  Wouldn't that be fun?!  Like I don't know a fuckin lie and/or a trap when I see one.  So, I politely said thanks, but no thanks.  He defensively asked why.  I told him that aside from the fact that I have to get up at three o clock in the morning to go to work, and that I'm nearly 26 years old and a bit too old to be going over to someone's auntie's house for a fuckin sleep over, I don't want to.  After hangin up the phone, I opened a new beer, opened up my NEW He-Man boxed set, and quietly fell asleep."

"event","I think I left off with my hand through a wall.  Well, my good roomie decided that it was about that time for he and his lovely girlfriend to leave at that point.  Don't really know what made him go so abruptly; personally, I was just starting to have a fantastic time.
     Do you know what is so dangerous about destruction?  It's a drug, a powerful drug.  It's why arsonists burn, thievs steal, killers kill and all other sorts of ill shit.  I found myself, yesterday, with not just an itchy hand, but a feeling in my very soul that I hadn't felt in years.  No, not the feeling of breaking something, well, not really.  Not physical anyway.  But the feeling of breaking another grown man's belief in himself and his own abilities as an agressive human being.  Anyone who knows me personally would most likely define me as a very free spirit with a devil may care attitude.  Well, that persona is there for a reason and that reason is to keep this powerful feeling at bay.  I try so hard not to get involved with things and I try even harder to keep myself from fury; however, as I said before, this seemed like a perfect time for the Dragon to spread it's wings.
     The next night, I was drunk, asleep on my sofa.  (Where the fuck do you pass out?  Shit, at least it wasn't the bathroom floor!)  Suddenly I found myself violently woken up by the sounds of Welcome To The Jungle.  No, I wasn't having an episode.  My dear roomie, Mr. Douche McNasty himself, was kind enough to inform me that the police are going to be calling me.  Well, hell, I figured if I scared his witless ass so bad that he ran to the fuzz, I was just gonna cream myself right there.  However, Douche got himself into, yet another, situation due to that fun group of tweeker pricks that he calls his family.  Surprised?  I wasn't, this sort of thing usually happens in my house.  Particularly on the days that end with 'y'.  It seemed that after he left he went with his girlfriend's house, gasp! so they could share a bed together on Valentines Day.  Sob.  Isn't that beautiful?  Yeah, well if they were fuckin I'd give maybe, just maybe half of a rat's ass about it.  Course, I'd get sick at the thought of unevolved primates breeding another mutant to breathe our air.  Usually it's just mine, but I live for my readers.
     Anyway, back to the story, apparently, while Douche was being a sexual failure, someone decided to slash his ex-girlfriend's mother's tires.  Tongue twister!....sorta...shut up!  Ah, but here's where it gets really fun!  Somehow, there were three witnesses that saw him doing it!  But, how can this be?  It like: Bear driving car, how can this be?  Sorry, Clerks joke.  OH, but there's more!  I asked him what that had to do with the price of tea in China.  His sophmoric response was, ""huh?""  Which pissed me off cause I hate repeating myself, I also hated the fact that fuckwit decided to call me at quartar to eleven, when I get up to work at 3.  So, I asked what in the name of hell did any of this shit have to do with me?  Now, this part is so special, I can hardly hold back the tears swelling inside:  Apparently, these three witnesses seeing fuckwit jack up his ex's momma's ride also saw me with him while he was doing it.  Glee!  
     Well, at this point, he had my undivided attention (for once).  Oh, the wings were in a stretch, the neck cracked and the talons reached.  But, I still wasn't there yet.  Something didn't quite sit well with me.  I knew the answer, but was feeling masochistic enough to want to hear it.  I don't have a listed telephone number.  I have a cell phone (that's right ladies, the phone lines are now open!  Any callers?  Anyone?  Anyone at all?  Damn), so, how did the fuzz get my fuckin number?  Well duh.  Did he admit it at first?  Nope, this dipshit even tried to deny that he even said that the fuzz would call me!  What a fuckin moron.  After refreshing his memory by my threatening to get off the sofa, go to his girl's house, and drag him out into the moonlight bare naked so I can cut him in the freezing air, just to watch the steam and the color of blood in the moonlight.  C'mon, didn't any of you see Red Dragon?  Movie quotes, duh!  I would like to make my anger perfecly clear, my loves.  I fucking hate cops.  My dad was a cop for twenty years, I nearly became one until I found out that they didn't issue Bat-erangs.  Therefore, I certainly would not like my number and/or my address offered to the cops.  This fuckin little amature got pinched, not even just a little, and he fuckin pawns this shit off on me!  Now, I was awake.  And I don't mean getting out of bed.  I mean the spirit in me was up, roaring and wanting to rule.  And rule I did.  Pt. 3 later.....Oh yes, there will be fun.  Here's a little hint:  It's my turn to play games, and I'm always good for a mind fuckin.  (For bad people only, I really am a sweetheart deep down)"

"event","Well it's been an interesting few days since the last post.  First let me formally say: FUCK VALENTINES DAY!  That having been said, lets get to the fun shit.
     For those who may or may not have been following this fun adventure that is my life, my room mate, who I took in as a favor to my previous boss, is still playing pawn to the shinannagans (I love that word) of his tweeker family.  Everything was just fine and dandy until he, again, announced that he was going to be using my car to pick up some drugs.  Hey, I was havin a shitty day and I rarily ever whack my brain out with anything besides alcohol.  However, he, again, decided to return without drugs.  Kevy angry.  He's used that excuse and the excuse that the dealer didn't show.  Everywhich time I've asked him if these shit smears are new to this game.  I mean seriously, where I come from, when a deal gets botched, a sucka gets dead.  That's just the name of the business.  Which, on the other hand, is one of the reasons why I moved here.  The fun reality of the story is, this douche bag really is making a score and taking it all himself before he brings my car back.  Kevy very angery.  Well, this last time was the last time.  He decided to take my car with him to this ignorant little swill called Southerland.  It's like 'Tweeks 'R' Us' for rednecks.  I hate tweek.  Get a life people and get some fuckin class.  Meth is bad.  Coke is good!  (Y'know, for a very poor man, I tend to be very aristocratic; go fig)  Anyhoo, I digress from my point.  
     So, douche bag decides to take me coche to Tweekersville with him to his cuntling family's house.  Ohhhhhh, Kevy muy muy angry.  So, after I've demanded that my vehicle to be brought back, in a tone of voice that a spectator only defined as ""creepy"", douche finally came back to the ponderosa.  In which the arguement of why my word is God's word in my home and pertaining to my property.  When he asked me what I have against his family, I decided to be honest.  Lets face it kids, it's the best policy.  I mentioned the fact that the tweekers broke my screen door tryin to get into my house to which he responded loudly that they would never do such a thing.  Apparently, this dingus, yes I said dingus, has never tasted the delicacy that is poverty and desperation.  And then he decided to be smug and inform me that his redneck, douche drinkin, tweeker-uncle wanted him to tell me that if I don't keep my mouth shut and go along with things that he'd, ""kick (my) pussy ass"".  Hm.  Well, last time I checked, my ass didn't smell anything as good as a pussy.  (sorry ladies)  And I've never ever found one on me bum, so, I felt it was the right time to prove the rumors about me true.  Actually, it was more of the swelling of the ""dragon"", and the spreading of the proverbial wings of rage (but who's counting) that made me nod my head and then throw a precission punch just right of his head and threw my bedroom wall.  Have you ever seen someone pee themselves because you just demonstrated their weakness to them?  I have, and it was good. :-)  I reminded him that when I say that I'm not someone to be trifled with, that I certainly mean in redneck terms, ""Don't fuck with me"".  At which point I slowly removed my hand out of the wall, never taking my eyes off of his and told him that if his uncle wants to see hell, that all he has to do is come to my house.  And that if he wanted to stay in my house a second longer that he either needed to get his shit together, or get his shit out.  
     Well, the hand still stings a bit, nothing to worry about.  I'll leave part two for later.  Until next time:  Smoke if ya got em!"

I thought it might be a cool place to just jot down some of my strange-ass (ahem, but brilliant....or somethin) thoughts.  But, just on random,  I met this totally cool gal.  Her sense of humor and fun is rad!  That's right America, the Kev said the sacred ""r"" word.  She's rad!  No, I'm not kissing ass.  I just show respect where it's due.  I mean, c'mon, I live in the most socially dry town this side of Utah!  I'm warped, I need warped people.  People who don't find fun in life without Jesus being physicly chained around their necks.  People who don't wear plaid because they think that it's the in style.  Wanna wear plaid?  Cool, but at least make it look cool, and not filthy.  Sorry, I'm digressing.  But, that's what this place does to me.  I guess I just kinda miss vibrant life.  That's why I go nuts when I meet a rad person.  Not that I hate my life here.  I like it.  After goin through all the crap I've gone through, quiet hermitude is kinda cool.  For now anyway."

"event","A few weeks back, my boss asked me to help out a fellow co-worker.  Well, since my curse of being a picies makes it really hard for me not to help people, I said yes.  I let the dude stay with me a while.  Well, in that time, I've found out that he's a pill popper, but hey, who am I to judge anyone of anything?  And I also found out that his only family in the area happen to be a worthless bunch of gold diggin tweekers.  This I can judge.  I hate feindish tweekers.  You do coke or crank?  No prob, but when you're so depraved of human evolution that you're willin to put a foreign dick in your mouth just for one hit, I give myself judging rights.  Anyhoo, movin along.  I made it clear to this roomie that I didn't want anyone to know what kind of car I drive, and that I didn't want anyone to know where I live.  I dig my privacy almost as much as I love my dvd's.  For those of you who don't know me, which would be anyone who accidently viddey's this drivel, I LOVE my dvd collection.  I've got about fourhundred.  Anyhow, he went to his tweeker's house with my car and led them back to my house.  Since then, he has gone to hide with my, now-former, boss, romanticly involved with one another and making excuses for one another.  While they've been off fuckin around while her seperated, yet legally binding, husband is away, I've had to deal with his family comming to my house thinking he's in there.  I've also had to endure them trying to break into my house.  They hide under my windows waiting to see if they can hear his voice.  The glory of tweek is, you're never bored, nor are you smart enough to realize what a dangerous waste of time your endevors are.  At a last straw, being the LA streets city boy that I used to be (actually, I was a writer, but I've got a colorful diversity of friends), I kicked the door open, hitting his uncle in the face with the door and informed him that the next time I even THINK that I hear anything outside my door, I'm not going to bother opening it before emptying a shotgun through it.  I hate violence, just like I hate cigarettes.  Yet I just keep smokin.  But, in all reality, I don't want to have to grease someone off of my porch, I want to be left alone.  Once my former employer's husband came home, they magically decided to come back to my house unannounced, ruining my fuckin buzz to boot!  I hate when people waste beer.  And then I have to pretend to be happy about seeing them instead of stringing them both up for making me deal with their problems while they're out spreading cornflakes and snailtracks all over Oregon hotel sheets.  I'm not gettin any so....fuck em.  Now, I get the evil eye for smokin with out going out into the thirty degree weather.  They leave my machines on, burning out the motors and attract tweekers; my ultimate pet peeve.  I don't mind drugs or drug users, just junkies.  This one is more of a long ranting gripe, since I really can't tell anyone about this problem as they probably wouldn't listen or believe me anyway.  That and there's always the hope that maybe, just maybe, some groovey chick who's just as sick and twisted as me, may read this and think it's pretty fuckin funny.  Which, it kinda is, or at least it will be.  I need pin ball and LSD.  Hmmm, never done that together now that I think of it :-)"

"event","Since I've gotten my very own place to hide and be alone with my secrets and the dark, I've learned so much.  For starters, I'm crazy.  Yes indeedly, I've been diagnosed as bi-polar.  Which, I'm assuming, is how this reality's science can register someone like me.  The funniest part is, my shrink doesn't know whether to put me someplace or write a book about me.  Sorry, Jeff, but I get a quarter for every page that makes reference to me.  I may be crazy, but I ain't stupid.  
     Now that I'm completely surrounded by nature, I'm able to hear things within me that have been dormant for several years.  Self discovery would automaticly relate to a sexual preferance, but since I'm not having sex, it obviously doesn't apply.  No, I'm just delving deeper into myself than I ever was brave enough to before.  Perhaps I was so scared of what I would find that I convinced myself that there was nothing to find....that I was 'normal'.  BOR-RING!  Anyhoo, what I am, and what I can do, goes far beyond my 'old friends' that talk to me from time to time.  It goes into the world that I can see that most don't or won't with my eyes wide open.  I can feel everything now.  I can feel the trees, the animals, the water and the sky.  My eyes, in this time have turned quite a dark color.  Does this color reflect my soul?  Probably not, cause I'm still a moosh.  However, it is a significant change, I kinda like it.  
     I can affect people's health with my feelings or with a simple wish.  I have to resist temptation with this.  For as ""crazy"" as I am, living within a different world than the one that people can see, I have a severly different moral stature.  Some people, deserve to be hurt as they would hurt others, and I can do it; however, sigh, that is not to say that I should or do.  But my god how I'd love to.  For example, I have a dear friend who is pregnat, her ex and baby's day-day is a douche bag who decided to have a wild hair up his ass and slug her with full strength right in the stomach.  Now, this was not one of those times where I had to restrain myself.  Actually it took five or six people to restrain me, and I'm not that big of a guy.  He would have died.  He would have shared my pain.  If people hadn't have held me down in a chair, kicking, swinging, snapping and crying, his suffering could only have been defined as legendary, even in hell.  You see, in my world, there are things that you do, and things that you do not do.  THAT is one of those things that's on my no no list.  
     I don't think that I'm as evolved as I would like to be or could be, but I do, in a way, feel more complete than I did several years ago when I first entertained the admition that I'm something else.  In fact, with one minor exception, I think I'm something completely different than that original idea.  Either that, or myself and the person who awoke me, couldn't fathom what I would awake to me in this life with that power.  She used to get so upset at me for not remembering the things that she did.  I used to feel so inadequit for her.  I worship her.  But, I was not meant to do the things I can, or understand the things that I do then, that much I'm certain of.  I wasn't ready for that responsibility.  I'm sorry, Ly.  For example, the first time I admitted my, then, newfound ability, I accidently put that person into a mental ward.  True story.  He couldn't handle what I pulled out of him, and it drove him insane for a time.  He couldn't see the color red without becomming very affraid or uncomfortable.  Happy ending to this one though, he is now happily married with child and a school teacher.  I'm very proud of him.
     However, for as complete in myself as I feel, this evolution, revolution or completion has only made me feel that much more alienated and/or alone.  Distant from anyone who walks around me.  Oddly enough, with what and who I am, I strangely feel a certain sense of responsibility for those who would shun me.  No, not like christ.  I feel responsible to help those who can evolve but don't know where to start.  I feel responsible for people in danger when they don't know it, even though they don't believe me that they're in danger.  
     So, I take this responsibility and I wander, helping, curing, evolving.  I'm the nomad.  I am the dragon; I know this and embrace it now."

Love has eluded me and people wanting to be my true friends have forsaken me by thinking that I've forsaken them.  Missing lost loved ones and grinding away at work. Saving galaxies one game at a time....I'm a busy boy.  Back to the doctor, for the knee and the mind, finally admiting that I'm not human and feeling that much more distant from the one that I've lost.  Sigh, sorry I never write anymore.

"event","Aparently, it is that hard to say.  Misused and abused like the queen of the trailor park, the term is on the brink of meaningless.  Whether you say it too much or too little, hardly anyone means it anymore.  Why?  Well, part of the reason is because our parents told us that we're too young to date just one person.  So, needing to be free and more desired, we tend to make ourselves less available (well, less obtainable).  Another reason is because people don't know how to truly love themselves.  I know, I know its the old cliche, you can't love people if you don't love yourself.  Cliche or not, its true.

Here's a neat question:  Have you ever felt 'super charged' when touched or when touching your lover?  Not someone you're gratuitously fucking, but the person that makes your heart THUD.  Like your spine could just curl up backwards and tear your back open, but in a completely orgasmic way...Mmmmmm...

Well, forgive the absense for the last couple of days, not that you exist anyway, but this paper has been kicking my ass up and down candy land.  Its done, but I don't ever want to read any 16th century plays for a while...alas, I must read Richard III by monday.  Methinks it doth bloweth!  Well, at least somethins gettin blown ;-)Anyhoo, the paper is done and finally got finished (after having lost the third page) right as the bell tolled nine, which meant my narrow ass needed to be in class.  I don't care if I fail that paper at this point, I'm just glad that I beat the odds and got it done on time.  I'm just that good lol.

And finally to finish the fisrt paragraph, people, don't be affraid to tell someone that you love them.  There is no proper time (like the two day rule for the phone) to tell someone that they're your Klondike bar.  (you'd do some crazy shit for them)  Truly, there is love at first sight.  Perhaps one could love another before they've even laid eyes upon them.  I've seen it happen to other people...why not.  I've been wrong for worse things.  Like that whole ""my ex-fiance may have changed"" bit.  Yeah, I'm still punching myself in the balls over that one.  But I suppose if we allow ourselves to look for a soul that is like our own, if we can touch that soul before we even touch its body, if we can see ourselves in that persons eyes and hear our voices in their words, if we can do something dumb completely on impulse and win the world for it as a reward, then maybe, just maybe I'm right.  (Well I am a fuckin genious!  Course I'm right.)"

"event","Well, I would like to say that being 24 yesterday and 25 today, that I feel no different.  That is a lie.  I'm kinda bummed today.  Not that thats a far stretch from most days but m'eh.  Supposedly, there's this really nasty paper that I'm supposed to have written by tomorrow afternoon that has yet to spring from my fingers, again, m'eh.  Professors can ride me all they want, I maintain, who does this professionally?  

Enough of that crap, Today, was pretty much the nicest day (weatherwise) that I've had up here since...well, so far really.  It was so serene.  I knew there had to be some personal reason why I left the ""jungle"" for this zoo.  It wasn't too warm, wasn't quite cold, and there were no birds out.  It was just nice and quiet.  Granted the ever immenant presence of school loomed about that serenity but that was my choice to go.  Not that I've done to much, but its my birthday, I'm entitled to fuck off today.  

It really is kinda discouraging, though, to look around at all the people in the library on campus.  They move around a lot like the people do in ""the jungle"".  The only difference is, well, I suppose there is no difference they all think that the sky is going to fall down on them and negate all of existance if they take a moment to be cool.  What really bothers me is that these people get laid and I don't.  Granted they couldn't even appreciate that, could they?  Nope.  Sport fuck, sport fuck, sport fuck.  Guys and gals, neither one of ya'z are getting off of the hook.  This goes back to what I said about people only knowing how to secrete on one another.  Appreciate what your partner can do to and for you and he/she will drive you nuts and make you cum frequently and quickly.  Sex should be fun for both people.  I hate guys who try to set the land speed record as if they're going to get the girl off faster that way.  Little secret fellas.  SHE'S FAKING IT WHEN YOU DO THAT!  If you paid attention to what she really feels like when you make her cum (if you make her cum) then you'd know the difference, but since you don't just keep believing that you're god's special creature and could make granite spew and quiver.  Dumbass.  But I hate girls who aren't happy unless the guy flails his nuts upon her while she just lies there.  He does all the work and then she ends up disappointed and with something to bitch about.  She ends up lying, he walks away with a swollen head and a shriveled dick and no one is truly happy.  Um, hello, waist of time?  Table 1?!
     Make it interesting.  Laugh a little.  You know what I think is hysterical?  Farting on accident while having sex or performing oral sex.  How natural yet taboo is that, and the best part about it is, no one would really laugh unless they were watching it happen.  But it IS funny.  People are too damn sexually repressed and sexually insecure that they can't laugh at themselves.  You have to be able to laugh at yourself in all aspects of life.  Secret: life's a fuckin joke anyway, might as well be one of the fuckers that gets to laugh.  But if you aren't having fun yourself, you certainly can't be anyfun to be around with.  I'd say who wants to be around a dead fuck, but apparently lots of people do lol.  Be silly, people.  Be silly and make dumb noises to tease your partner while spooning.  Blow zerberts on their neck and suck on their ears.  Talk about conflicting!
     Wouldn't it be cool if we could pay that much attention to other people in our lives that way?  Just think of what would happen; we'd stop being so selfcentered.  We'd start caring about other people.  Friends, family and eventually a complete fuckin stranger.  Author's Note:  There really isn't any fun in that, just speculating.  JK.  
     I suppose now I'm going to hop down in the dungeon and either work on this paper, play some video games or take a nap with the cat.  Perhaps I can squeze in all three, but I'm thinking I should probably get to this paper.  
     Well, my dearest person who doesn't exist, fare thee well.  Until I get another inclinatation to bitch about something.

"event","If indeed anyone reads that last post where I called my ex a whore for cheating on me with a man (and I use that term loosely) who hasn't been within ten yards of a bar of soap since the eighties, I feel that I should explain, I don't like degrading women.  I actually have very high regard for women, until I see them better deal someone and/or cheat on them...then they become a whore in my world (and its so much fun here :-)).  However, the very same could be said about men.  Men are probably the dirtiest whores of them all.  That having been said, lets have some fun...

If a girl sleeps with more than three men a year she will be labled a whore.  If a man sleeps with more than three women a year, he's sowing his wild oats.  Well, thats generally not true.  As humans we abandoned virtue a long loooooong time ago, so you can't tell me that a woman should hold true to her dignity and sling one asshole a year.  Sorry, just doesn't work.  Men are liars by nature and we always shall be.  So, if a girl is lucky enough and smart enough she will see that a man is a lying asshole early on and move on.  But if she sleeps with him before she does leave him, does that lessen her?  Does she still not learn that the dude is a jerkoff and does she not better herself for leaving the jerkoff.  And believe me, the ratio of douche bags to nice guys is fuckin vast!  The odds of sleeping with a nice guys versus finding out the dude is an ass are huge.  Now, in all this, guys have killed little pieces of women (girls you've helped do this too, you're not off the hook just yet) that have severly destroyed the dating realm.  If a girl won't put out, she's a slut, if she does sleep with the dude, she's a slut; so where's the winning in that?

Doesn't the whole whore thing really give way to circumstance?  I think so.  A girl can sleep with three or more guys a year because of poor circumstances of dating.  Sure there are some girls who give up a teddy bear for a penis as their security vice, but its better than guys who never ever ween away from the boob.  I'd like to think that when sex becomes nothing more than the opportunity to secrete on someone (or in them if you're into it)then you shouldn't be doing it anyway.  For one thing, you're not going to do it well.  Since there really is no right and wrong way to have sex.  But to be a good lover you should listen to your partner and know like a jedi how to make them scream.  Be patient and wait for their body to tell you what it craves and then give it at the speed and quantity that their body desires.  Author's note:  You don't have to set the land speed record for humping.  All you're going to accomplish guys is a bad back and a reputation for being the fastest gun in the west; no longer a desired name.  
     So does being a good lover make you a whore?  Only if you abuse your gift I suppose.  Shouldn't the goal be to give your gifts and abilities to just one special person?  Yes, but rarely do you find a man or woman these days with that mindset.  Men want to fuck everything that has a moist dark hole (which is why sea cucumbers are underwater and not pets)and women want to be with who can show them the best time.  Oh what a shitty time to be a well natured poor bastard, lol.  Plenty of nice people can make your heart soar, but we rarely give them the chance for whatever reason.  Hey, I'm not raggin on anyone, I've done it myself.  I've been that retard too.  Take my ex who left me for the dirt merchant, who was cheating on me with a dirty dirt merhant.  I would have liked to have thought that by being with me and me showing her that she is more than worth love, that she would have thought higher of herself than to go out and try to get fleas from a pissant like that.  I'm not jealous, mind you, just disappointed in her choices and blatant display of how little she thinks of herself.  She's a good kid, just doesn't give herself a whole lotta credit.  
     On the other hand, its enough to annoy me into writing to an invisible person who will never ever read this, and spending my day and nights in my basement where I won't have to deal with the joys of dating.  Though to be honest, I'm quickly getting over that phase.  I do want out.  And very soon, I'll be back out to play.  I'm not pouting, I'm just resting my mind and vaccationing if you will.

So, is there an overall message?  No, not really.  Just felt like bitching about everyone for a bit.  Guys are as bad as girls are as bad as guys.  Dig?  Whore is all what you do with yourself and how much you respect yourself.  Guys don't respect themseves for the most part.  Though, everyone, guy and gal, have plenty of reasons to respect themselves, they just rarely ever take the time to think about it.  Laters.

I suppose the first question would be, who am I, right?  Fair enough, well, I'm Kevin Smith.  No, not the famous fat one, though I've met him several times.  I just moved to Oregon from Southern California and let me tell you, the city mouse has no place in the country.  Dispite the fact that the city sissifies you to certain aspects of nature (snakes, spiders and all other forms of satanic life forms) the people really get to me.  Comming from an area near LA I tend to move fast just as habbit.  Here, in redneckville, people tend to move very slow.  Which, I suppose, I should respect on one hand because everyone needs to take time to slow down in life and just be cool, but when you have to wait several minutes for someone to spit out a simple polysyllabic sentence you eventually want to strangle them or tell them to put the mouth in over drive.

Ironicly, Oregon is a breeding pit for ignorance.  We are the last state of the Confederacy for one thing, but what I really mean is the phrase ""babies having babies"" must have originated here.  When I first moved here I was asked by a very cute girl if I had any children.  I was almost offended by I have to admit I am getting older.  I told her no and she immediately wanted to know why, as if I was gay or impotent.  I told her it was because I was only 24.  ""So, my friend is only 20 and she has two kids.""  Now, I'm sorry, but thats just scary.  Rednecks reproducing is bad enough, but young (extremely ignorant) rednecks reproducing is even worse.  And then I found out all that people do here is have sex.  That isn't too much of a problem, or at least it shouldn't be, but where I come from we have these niffty little hats made just for our penis' called condoms.  Those magical little doodads help prohibit my demon seed from spreading and growing.  I know that poverty strikes logging communities fairly hard but, please, rubbers aren't that expensive, in fact sometimes they're free.  No, these little monkeys don't stop and think.  These are the type of nimrods that spend their Friday and Saturday nights in a remote field drinking up some piss poor beer that they conned someone into getting for them.  They get drunk, the guys, obviously tired of sheep, feel the need to be ""sexual conquerers"" and fuck everything in sight.  Spreading the happies and the hiv all across town.  Personal experience, I just dated a girl that (I thought was very nice) had the nickname ""Sleezy Breezy"".  Cute.  She broke up with some dope slinging (no offense to any respectable dirt merchants who might one day read this) red neck, douche bag named Cleatus.  Seriously, I don't think I could make that up.  Dude's name is Cleatus.  In this day and age of Technology and Enlightenment some trailor jockey named her mutt Cleatus.  Not only that, dude's name was Cleatus The Third.  OoooooKay.  Anyhoo, I don't think I ever saw this goofball clean.  Neither his clothes or his hands have ever been clean in the times that I've have the displeasure of having my sinuses raped by his presense.  I couldn't help but to ask my ex, ""How did you fuck someone who can't bathe?""  Now she got mad at me for saying that.  Course I didn't know it was because she was still fucking Pigpen.  Humorously enough, I figuredthat her reputation for being the village bicycle was bogus because if it were true then that would make every single guy that she's been with totally Jewish (sorry noble hebrews, I didn't mean it literally, just stereotypically) in the sack.  Granted I'm not worth tootin my own horn but really, if I can teach a whore some new tricks there's something wrong.  
     The point to all that:  The people up here are complete whores who are too ignorant to know what the hell they're doing.  They secrete.  Thats all they do.  They're to damn ignorant and unexperienced to be a decent and considerate lover so they give a three pump grunt and secrete and spread disease and polute the earth with more ignorant Cleatus's.  I'm all for civil rights, but some people really shouldn't be allowed to reproduce.  Especially if they have all the experience in the world but still have no experience at all.  The moral of that story: if you're a redneck and can't afford to educate yourself or anyone else, or if you can't afford to raise someone properly...STOP FUCKING!
     That having been said, I should apologize in advance, if anyone reads any of this, they're most likely setting themselves up to be offended.  Please do forgive anything that you may feel is offensive unless of course you fit the stereotype of anyone that I may take a jab at.  For example, if your name is Cleatus, I don't have a beef with you and wouldn't begin to jab at you; however, if your name is Cleatus and you are a dirt merchant and have yet to discover the joys of soap...just stop reading now.  But I'm not a bad person, nor am I really as opionated as I sound, I just tend to rant a bit...well, a lot but I eventually stop.  Besides, I can always admit that I'm wrong, in fact it happens commonly as I'm sure it does with many of you.

At anyrate, steer clear of redneckville if you have any class whatsoever, because you shall find none here.  I have, however, fallen into a small group of people that I can talk to and actually enjoy doing it.  It just took me eight months to find someone that can talk polysyllabicly without trying and who doesn't have a full head of booze or drugs.  Unfortunately, I offended one of them today.  I shouldn't care.  Truly, I shouldn't, but for some strange reason, I feel absolutely horrible for making her sad.  Part of what a friend of mine and I were talking about was the whole ""stop fucking"" rant just summed up by the human condition.  Well, she didn't like the fact that I sounded like a man who has no hope in anything.  That is so not the case.  Contrary to what I sound like, I'm a huge romantic and I do believe that love will lead the individual to personal divinity.  Oooh, esoteric.  But outside of making this beautiful girl (and she truly is inside and out, quite possibly one of the most beautiful that I've met since I've come here) sad, I didn't get a chance to tell her how I feel about hope and all that flowery shit.  I didn't want her to understand me and I could slap my friend for not letting the human condition go.  Course, I also told her before I knew alcoholism is rapant in her family, that I have no sympathy for addics because I've been an addict to several vices and still personally chose to come out on top.  Yes, shitty Kev.  

Perhaps if I just keep my mouth shut and grin and not and smile about ice cream and puppy dogs I could actually attract a decent woman; however, I've always said that I can never be anything more or less than myself, I think differently and that makes talking with people difficult for me and them.  Something I'm working on.  But one thing I will not do is lie to someone and make them think I'm someone else.  I'll tell them, if they havne't already figured it out, that I can come off as a jerk, but its just the way I talk.  Sadly, none of them really tend to believe me until its too late, and then I'm suddenly an asshole.  Oohwell.  Perhaps my endevour to meet nicer people is an up hill battle.  Or, perhaps I'm just better off sitting here with you; writing out my drivel and working on masterpieces that may or may not get published.  At anyrate, what difference does it make, I'm turning 25 tomorrow (and only my hairline knows for sure) and I'm sure I'll have a different opinion tomorrow or later tonight.  I just feel bad about making others who don't deserve it feel bad.  I'll try to talk to her again.  Unfortunately, I'm sure she'll think I'm stalking her or trying to hit on her and she won't really understand that I'm sorry, but thats not my concern.  That's her baggage not mine.  I'm just going to do my part and say that I'm sorry and tell her what I really feel about the things she holds true.  (See, it is better to have an idea rather than a belief.)

Anyway, thats my schtick for this hour.  Laters

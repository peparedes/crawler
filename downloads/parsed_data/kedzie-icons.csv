<b>This was my very first icon challenge, and I worked so bloody hard on my entries. Since <lj user=""neutral_zone""> only allows jpg/gif entries and ONLY 2, I had such a hard time picking one I liked. I was nervous because the Neutral Zone is a high end icon place, so I knew competition would be tough. I was so chuffed when I won first place. I truly was amazed that I did.</b>

<b>This was a entry I made in a few minutes and it came in first. An artist knows when to stop fiddling around with something and just let it go. Since I agonized with the first challenge, I decided to take the easier approach and just let the icon happen. It worked.</b>

<b>I am very proud of this one since I love Dr McCoy and have always thought he was the best of the three senior officers on the bridge. With this one, I took more time and had abit more skill in blurring and sharpening, which can really make a icon look cool.</b>

<b>I just found these banners at voy_cons (silly me for not looking -  either that or LJ is not sending me all my friends entries). I liked what I did with them all, and of course, if its a Seven or Janeway challenge, I am in there like a dirty sock!</b>

<b>I really wanted one of slashy pairing icons to win...or at least be recognized. I am not alone in my Seven/Janeway fetish, but there is alot of Janeway/Chakatoy fans too (and I like the guy too, just not with my two girls!). Again, I agonized over which icons to submit and even asked a friend to critique them so I could have a second opinion before my entries went in. I didn't win but the icon was a ""mod choice"" which is just as cool.</b>

<b>These I threw together very quickly to get to the deadline. If it's Janeway, it's good!</b>

<b>This was another first. The only thing I had to work with was the prompt ""hands"" and that was it. No pictures, zippo! So I made quite a few and was quite surprised one actually won! I think this was my 2nd challenge.</b>

<b>I love The Doctor and although I don't think these were the best icons I ever made, they certainly were different. I started playing around with desatuation tools to give the background a B&W feel.</b>

<b>God, I really agonized over these! I suppose if I hadn't sent in so many entries, maybe I would only have one banner, but I love to submit the maximum amount allowed. The more the merrier. This was another early challenge, and I was still experimenting.</b>

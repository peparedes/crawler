This is what pine falls does to you. I don't mind though, it makes city events seem thaaat much more exciting when I go back there. Well, I'm off to send in my thousand dollar downpayment for residence that I can barely afford and hope it makes it there by thursday! :S eek. Well, Have a fantastic day anybody who reads this! 
I am content,
BUHBYE!

"event","Tonight, gets two thumbs up from me...I'd give it more thumbs if I had more.
Though I am in a ""glass cage of emotion"", tonight is one of my most content nights in a very long time.
I am happy, and I think I will sleep like a baby tonight, and I am happy about that.
There will be no elaboration on my happiness,but i am happy.

This will be the end of my drunken, i am happy entry.
I am going to have a good sleep, with good dreams, and wake up smiling. 
This is my goal.
Night everybody,
Chantelle

"event","I do not deserve to be here.
Here meaning university lol
I am far too lazy, i shouldn't be passing these recent assignments.
Cudos to a teacher that will give me a failing mark, so I realize I must try.
Actually I realize this...all the time...somehow it isn't enough to get me goin.
The B- i got on my last sociology test, the C i got in my physical health and wellness midterm...They aren't good marks at all.
But i deserved to fail because i didn't study.
Oh well, next year...next year will be a keener year for me. Maybe.
I make a lot of deals with myself that I don't keep.
hehe...it's more fun that way.
Well, this was a pointless entry thing, but i don't care too much. Pretty apathetic lately lol.
I'm off to go let Ronnie swipe me through lunch yet again...hehe, oh what would I do without that girl
Take care to anyone who read this pointless thing,
Just killing time. because that is what i do.

"event","Well..work yesterday was really good. It was super busy in there non-stop, until finally we ran out of bread completely. Which is crazy because there was TONS when i got to work at 4:30. I was pumped because i got to do nothing for like an hour until 8. I also talked more with one of the girls I work with and she's really nice. Found out we are in the same Physical Health and Wellness course, and so she's going to let me photocopy some of her notes after work today! Yippee:) So yep, work was good! I broke the news to my mom about my test, and she e-mailed me back. I was soooo scared to read her e-mail, but it was an awesome email and totally made me feel better and a bit relieved. She started it with, ""well...shit happens"" haha, which isn't something I expected from my mom at all, but yeah. And she finished it with, and I still love you even if you have a D- in psychology. hehe, it was a cute email. So i had big plans to study my little heart out after work yesterday, but...hehe instead I hung out with Ronnie until sleep time haha. It was a goodtime, and Phan gave us fudgsicles!!!!!!! YAY! (Awesome man...Phan is PHANTASTIC:P) So today's plan: I had class, then lunch with ronnie, then try and find a copy of the physical health and wellness text book so I can read for my mid-term tomorrow, then study for my mid-term, then work, then study, then sleep, then wake up and study, then psychology class, then lunch, then midterm:S...I'll never follow that plan, but I can try at least lol. K, well i think i am going to go on a clean random things in my room in hopes to find my student card mission. 
Take Care everybody,
Chantelle

Had a shitty sleep, woke up and decided psychology class wasn't happening today. I text messaged my friend in the class to let her know I'd be missin. I got a text msg after the class. My friend informs me that she just got my msgs...and we had a test today in class. I look up on my calender confused like hell, and starting to panic. I look at the date on my computer, March 7th. Then I look back at my calender. I had been looking at the wrong week. I thouhgt all my shit was next week. I missed a philosophy paper that was due yesterday, and my psychology test today. This is where I grab my kleenex box, and go to town...who misses their test? Finally i msg my friend in philosophy and she tells me, that our philosophy paper's due date was moved to next friday. well at least i didn't miss that. I still missed my test though. My mark is now changed from a B- to a D-. My mom is going to kill me. I am officially an IDIOT. who does this? -I thought i had over a week to study for my midterm, but nope, it's on thursday. Man, oh man, oh man...today is poop. <br />back to bed for this girl, maybe i can sleep the day away until work and pretend it never happened.</font> <br />"

"event","Damn, my last entry never made it on, because my stupid computer crashed. haha oh well! lol, shit happens lol So here it goes again!!

It is 12:27pm, and i've decided I am just going to write random things throughout tonight while I attempt cleaning my room, lol

K, well I DO NOT know how to make a Pita for the life of me!! Wow, I am never ever going to get hired at a Pita Pit place because I SUCK at it lol. I mean how can you screw up filling a big pita thing up that only has one hole. But trust me in wrong hands (namingly mine) things can go bad....very very bad. Oh well, guess I'll have to just cross Pita Pit worker off my list of potential life careers (*Tear*)...but don't worry about me, I think i can go on...get over this whole ordeal. or maybe this will turn into the story about ""The Pita That Killed Me""...okay I'm definitely killing the Pita thing so I will stop with that.

On Another note, I totally signed up to be one of those people who photocopies all of their notes for somebody with a disability. Yeah that's right, I can say i've NEVER missed that class, and i am just thaaat nice of a person :P. It was very spontaneous of me, I love it!!

I was also very pumped that I tried on a dress today of Jessie's that I actually liked (this is very rare for me) too bad it was a bit too damn small! lol

Moving along...""WOW""...That is the only word that can describe the present state of my dorm room. It progressed from bad, to worse, to HORRIBLE!. This is why I am deciding to start cleaning it tonight. And I tend to clean late at night, i'm wierd like that lol. (Maybe it's because I know I can dance around in a dork t-shirt, and my pajamas all rolled up and looking ever so hot, dancing around to music without anybody knocking on my door hehe)-Yes I am a nerd, and No I don't care too much lol:P

Well...i'll probably write another one of these tonight, but if not...TATA

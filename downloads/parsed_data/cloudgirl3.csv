"event","So yesturday I walked into my cafe alone. As I walked in he door, I noticed that a guy was staring at me... and it was really obvious. I got to the 'food doors' and another guy turned around and looked at me and smiled/his eyes got big. Then I was getting my drink and another guy walked up next to me and was looking at me then said something so stupid just to make conversation.

I couldn't figure out why everyone was looking at me so as soon as I left the cafe, I went to the closest mirror to make sure there was nothing on my face. 

When i realized my face was fine and I had nothing in my teeth... I couldnt seem grasp the fact that they were just looking at 'me'...

why is that so hard for me to believe?"

"event","I came home for homecoming weekend in Holly, next weekend is homecoming up at State and I'm going to the game. The game Friday night was fun. On the way to the game zachs alternator died so we drove partially there on luck... haha long story! We got to spend time with britt and brett and dia, it was a lot of fun, I love how well we all get along. Then zach stayed the night over here and we had a huge heart to heart conversation until like 4:30 in the morning. I love those convos because we get everything out and we always come out closer in the end :) He was supposed to go to canada super early on sweetest day and I was sad so he actually stayed until 6 and it made my day. We went to starbucks and to the milford playground cuz he wanted me to see it since it's one of the biggest ones his dad has made. It's AMAZING how much work goes into makin a playground! I look up to them soo much. Now zachs in canada and I already can't wait until the next time I see him... I miss him :/

Luke looked so cute all dressed up in his lavender shirt and purple tie. I hope he has a great time! I just wish I could still go, I always had fun at dances. I fricken love how my mom figured out his plans and luke had no fricken clue what went down!"

"event","I'm really starting to get used to college, realizing this is my life and I love it. I absolutely love my Teachers Education/Psychology teacher! He told us to call him Matthew, he is even on of my friends on facebook. He's a Harvard Graduate, he was a 2nd grade teacher for a few years but now he is fulfilling his goal to become a college Professor. I'm so relieved to have him as my teacher since all of my other ones SUCK! 

I have been talking to dia a LOT lately and I miss her! we used to have so much fun together our freshman and sophmore years in High School. lol i remember the 3 in the morning phone calls, all the funny stories, Im pumped we are talking again!!! I just wish things were going better for her. I also miss brittany, i considered her one of my best friends last year but it wasn't until recently I  realized how much our personalitys actually did click! *Random thought: us three should hang out sometime when we are all home!*

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff9900>I have been doing career prep this year for my sixth hour class. Everyday I have gone to visit Mrs. Creaseys fourth grade class to help out. My last day of school there was last monday because they went on their three day field trip to Mackinac Island. Now I have been working for Mrs. Creasey cleaning her room... Today when I went in something was different...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=6>Last night there was a terrible accident. Nick Walls was riding his dirt bike with his 12 year old step brother. Nick was trying to catch up with his brother when he crashed into a barbed wire fence. The fence sliced through his neck... he walked 320 feet back to his grandparents house where he colapsed. The ambulence picked him up and tend to him the best they could. Before reaching the hospital, 45 minutes after the accident, he was announced dead. On Memorial Day, May 30&nbsp;Nick Walls died because he lost too much&nbsp;blood. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>I spent an hour with my class today. They are only fourth graders and were already talking about him in the pastence... It was like they understood he was gone but they didn't realize that meant they would never see him again. I heard stories about him from some of his best friends, and read the books they were making for each of his parents, I even talked to them about how they heard the horrible news. It was so depressing... I feel so close to all of those kids I hate to see them hurt. It was like they all clung to me today because they needed a distraction or a friend. I played games with them and helped them make a puzzle. I just wish I could help more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399><FONT size=5>In loveing memory:</FONT> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#66cccc>Nick had the biggest brown eyes that always had that curious look to them and he had the well knwon brown mushroom cut. He was very helpful and loved to smile. His laugh was the kind of laugh that made everyone around him laugh, including me. He sat right next to the carpet area where I work and his chair always got caught under the carpet yet he never got frusterated. His nickname was ""pencil boy"" because he was always playing with his pencil wether it be tapping it on the desk or on another pencil. He was so friendly and was liked by the entire class, God choose a great angel but we werent ready to give him up yet...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff size=6>Nick your class loved you and we all miss you</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Im getting kinda frustrated...Last night and this morning dance was so disappointing...for some reason, not even half the team showed up...I just wish everyone had the motivation to be good. I feel like a lot of the people on the team this year just dont have the right attitudes. I know we all have the potenetial to be a national winning team...Im just not sure how we will get there until we all feel lucky to be on the VARSITY team. Im sure we all remember the day when we looked up at varsity and couldnt wait to even try out to be on such an amazing team. I remember being in middle school when my sister first tried out and made it, they all started crying b/c they were so happy, people would drive down the street and honk at all the girls as they practiced. I want that for our team, I want all of us to feel lucky for being a part of such a great team and at least want to be at practices and try our hardest. I know what its like to be lazy and I will admit that I had that problem last year, and I appoligize to everyone on the team last year but one day it dawned on me that my lazy attitude wasnt gunna get me anywhere. And Im trying to work on that, I know my technech is low... but i want to be better and im trying to improve. I hope all of you on the team also strive to be a better dancer. If you have any input, please let me know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>I am a captain this year and if any of you on the team want to tell me something Im doing wrong or even right, please let me know b/c I want to fix whatever it is that makes people want to skip... thanks guys :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Being on Varsity is definately something people look up to, believe it or not...so many girls wish they were as good as you... and you all made the team because u have definate potential but it is up to you to achieve your full potential!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9966>Sorry for the lecture, I just felt it in me and had to get it out :)</FONT></P>

"event","<FONT color=#ffcc00>so last night I stayed after practice for 45minutes talking to angie and working on formations...teaching her daughter how to color...once I got out of the school, it was super dark and rainy... i was so scared! I decided to go over to zachs so I drove over there... but i drove right into the storm, at some points I thought it was going to tornado. I drove down ormond road...there is a huge stretch of flat land and they recently harversted the hay, so they had those huge hay barrels all over just like in twister, and i was driving through a ton of rain but all of a sudden it got super calm... i was expecting a funnel to come down at any second. </FONT><FONT color=#ff6666>Finally I made it to zachs house... he was such a sweetheart, he ran out to my car with a rain coat over his head to keep me from getting wet b/c they didnt have an umbrella. lol it was cute youd have to see it. we went in and talked to his mom for about an hour about silverlake (we are going up there for the weekend). Then we went down stairs and watched spiderman...I think we talked the whole time! it was a lot of fun, we talked a lot about food and the best kinds ever! lol zach and I love food way way way too much! But I swear we ALWAYS have so much fun... even talking about food...lol&nbsp;EXPESIALLY talking about food! I have to get ready for dance this morning...technech class 12-2 every thursday</FONT>"

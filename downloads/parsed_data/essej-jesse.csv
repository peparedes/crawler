"event","<font size=""2"">Damn, you're good. That's all I have to say. Okay since we had the talk, its kind of like we both pretend it didn't happen when we're around each other and everything's exactly the same as it has always been..which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. On the upside, maybe it shows that we can talk about these things and still be cool. On the downside...yeah the whole uncertainty thing. I still think about it all the time, though. I think maybe she's scared to continue talking about the subject because she's as uncertain as I am, but perhaps uncertain of different things. I don't know...</font>"

"event","<div align=""center"">The monster only comes out at night. For not fear of being caught but rather he knows that's when you are vulnerable. His fangs are of Viking knives. They cut through flesh like the said knife through butter. I hear dogs barking outside. I wonder if they found him. They can be vicious as well...They escape the pen to go attack unicorns and shit.&nbsp; What was that sound? Why has the barking stopped? Do you ever get the feeling you're being watched? Because I get that feeling every night just before I fall asleep. I want to open my eyes but I am afraid of what I might find. Sometimes I pray for death to make the fear go away.<br /></div><br /><div align=""center"">(Just thought of that off the top of my head for the hell of it...NOT TRUE!!! OR IS IT?!?!?!?!)<br /><br /><br /><font color=""#0000ff""><b></b></font></div><div align=""center""><font color=""#0000ff""><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b></font><font size=""3""><font color=""#0000ff""><b> ""  </b></font><font color=""#0000ff""><b>I want something good to die for, to make it beautiful to live""</b></font><br /><font size=""2"">These lyrics have been going through my head like crazy lately. It kinda describes how I feel inside a lot of times. If you have something you're willing to die for, it makes living worthwhile. But is that to say that if you're not willing to die for something, it's not worth living? I think the answer is yes. We all have people we care about and are willing to die for. If not the person in question has problems far greater than reading a blog post can help.<br />BTW the lyrics are from the song ""Go with the Flow"" by Queens of the Stone age.<br /><br />I think I finally decided on a major for now...Wait for it.....that's right, English. ""Why?"" you may be asking yourself. Well...I'm good at it. I apparently can write the shit out of a paper. Like today in English, everybody put their chairs in a circle and we read our rough drafts to the rest of the class. Of course, some people had some REALLY rough drafts. Horrible sentence structure, thoughts that go nowhere, you name it. I thought mine was not good at all, but I read it and when I looked up after finishing, people were looking at me in astonishment...Mrs. Byrd-Murphy finally believed my statement that I didn't need sources for my paper. I like to write and come up with shit anyway, so why not? Wouldn't it be cool as hell to write a book? Then travel to fucking Bangkok and London and shit to promote it...I would totally chill out with some Japanese dude I find on the street and give him a free copy of my book just to show me around.<br /><i><font color=""#ff0000"">If nothing else it makes me feel a little better for having something to shoot for.</font></i></font></font></div>"

"event","What up with the livejournal? This entry is being made on special request. So yeah, chillin' in the ASCC computer loft. People are talking. I'm typing. It's great. It sucks outside. I wouldn't mind it being wet. I also wouldn't mind it being cold. But both is entirely UNACCEPTABLE. THIS IS NOT DELAWARE. Luckily, I have one more class and I'll be out until like the Wednesday after school is back in. I kinda want a candy bar...but then again, I'm strangely craving some Subway. I have a feeling the sandwichy goodness will overcome. Did I mention that I am horribly bored?  I have things I could be doing, like skydiving, or flying with MJ. Yesh, that sounds niiiiiiiice. I'm also just rambling on because I need to get practiced up again on my typing. I've gotten pretty bad at it here lately because I haven't been blogging as much in the past month or two. I also got a request to write a thanksgiving story for the ASCC newspaper. It shall involve at least one turkey. Possibly hostile. 
       I've been listening to this song by Pearl Jam lately called ""Last Kiss"". It sounds all nice and upbeat like a 50's pop song until you listen to the lyrics. 

Where, oh where
Can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to Heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world."

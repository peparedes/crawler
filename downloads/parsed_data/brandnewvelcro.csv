Bad news: I have to get rid of my dog. Which I don't want to do. Fuck, I don't want to. She's my buddy and I feel like shit not being able to care for her. If I had the money I'd just put her in long-term boarding. 
I feel like a bad parent, however I will not have the time (I am hoping I get a second job to catch myself up and erase the massive amount of debt I have) and between one job or the other, and running around I may have time to sleep. Whcih means no time for her. I really don't want to drop her off at a shelter. I refuse to do it. I mean, there are no kill shelters around here, but I dont' want her to be overlooked. I did post an ad on craigslist, but I doubt anyone will look at it. I feel like a horrible person. I've tried looking for a foster home, someplace where she could jsut stay until I sort things out, hell I'd pay them, but they don't exsist. Because after 6 months or so I'd be stable enough to take her back in, but I can't just keep in a cage rushing in between jobs. I feel like shit. Anyone know of any decent rescues out there? I'd be willing to pay until someone adopted her. In fact, I want to pay the rescue for her upkeep....help?"

I went to San Franciso for a job interview (they said it will be a couple of weeks, going to call them Monday to check in). However, since returning, I can't quite shake the feeling that I should apply to more job interviews in that area. However, since I live out of state and I can't exactly keep flying from coast to coast whenever it pleases me, I've been thinking of taking out a small loan and just moving there. I am not looking for computer tech work. I would really want to work for a non-profit/animal agency type deal. I have a decent resume and excellent references. I just feel like my out of state address isn't exactly helping in this situation. 

I wouldn't live in the actually city ( I know how expensive it is there), and I have a couple of friends who would put up with me for a week or so I'm sure. 
I'm just..I feel like I need to do it, however I'm afraid that I'll never find a job in time. 

Anyone ever have this feeling?
Any advice?"

Alrighty, well I've always liked working with animals. ALWAYS. And pretty much am an animal person. I think I could probably get the grades I would need for vet school and I already have plenty of experience (am applying to summer internships as we speak). My grades are average (3.2) but they could be better. I can't even remember what I made on my SATs and I know I have to retake some basic math (think algebra 2)-but I'm okay with it, but I wonder what the MIGHTY LORDS OF VET SCHOOL APPLICANTS will see it as.

My life up until a two years ago was very tumultuous, up and down, impulsive;very emotional. 
Finally, I've got some grip on logic and what I actually need in life to be mostly happy. I'm more concerned with happiness then success. I figure if I am happy, then success will follow. But I digress. 
Besides my transition, falling in lust, crushing so hard it becomes an obsession-those two things have made my daily life complicated. I feel so intense sometimes, although I know it's just hormones and it has nothing to do with love or anything like that. But damn, I get to know someone and boom, I'm hooked. This is going to be a problem. I instantly fall to their spell, wanting nothing more than them.
I keep telling myself that I need to get a hold of myself. Stop letting my dick take control.

I put fresh food and water out and hung some dirty laundry, so that maybe that will tempt her to come back. I called the shelters and they all advised to come on in and take a look at the dogs to see if any where mine. I'm just really really worried about her and am thinking something bad happened to her.

"event","Complete change of zombie plans.
I was pondering on my idea, and realized that if I was going to be a zombie, someone else might be one too-hell there might even be three, because it's such a popular Halloween costume. 
And then it hit me-A T-Rex. Dinosaurs are way way cooler than zombies-okay that isn't true in all cases, but as for originality of ideas it is.
So, I promptly returned the zombie stuff I bought and looked around for an adult dinosaur something or other. 
Apparently, the only ""adult"" costumes that most stores carry is your standard stuff: kitten, angel, dracula, freddie kruger. Boring.
So then I decided to give myself a challenge: I'll make the costume myself. Granted Halloween is in...one..two....6 days and I do have to work most of those days, but still.
The only problem with it is with the leggings. I was just going to buy a huge men's sweater (green of course) and fancy it up, but that would still leave my very pale and very non dinosaur legs showing. Maybe black pany hose? Or black knee highs?
Also, I was thinking of having my face be in the neck area, so I would have the head sitting on top of me. Will it look okay? Or should I have my face in the back of it's neck? I would have to paint my face green then...hmmm.
Okay, so I totally need anyone's help. Where is the cheapest place to buy paint, cardboard, loads of glue and sparkly things? Oh, and any ideas on what to do for the feet? 
I appreciate it.

In all this planning I found a very nice comfortable hoodie. 
I'm sure everyone has it, as I found it in a department store, but it's nice and warm and has a guitar in it.
And, there should totally be a Lorax hoodie. I was hoping to find one (apparently, Dr. Suess is very popular this year), but they choose to print Horton. Now, I love Horton, but he doesn't come close to Lorax material.

My tattoo is burning and I'm exhausted. But ready!
Tally-Ho!"

Everyone says, ""Don't discuss politics"" or religion or anything that might get people angry. Why? Why do they get angry? Because they are wrong, that's why. IF you were right, you would calmly go through all the facts and debate your case and convince others to join your side. But nnooooo...that might upset someone. Oh no, are your feelings hurt? Is it because I don't blindly agree with everything you say? Is it because ""I'm the wierd one"" so I have to different views? Or maybe it's because you know I'm right and you're afraid that I'll have to change your views and open your eyes and make you ADAPT! to new ideas, new ways of life. Oh no. Did that upset your morning drive? Here, drink some fair trade organic coffee to make yourself feel better.

I don't know how to tell my mom that she hurt my feelings the other day when she said she was going to cook and then changed her mind and said that she isn't, but still wants me to come down, because ""of course, they'll have vegan things at random-buffet-place"" Oh yes, with all that butter and meat and eggs, of course they will. 
I know she's busy. But I like my mom's cooking. I like her little specialities she makes just for me. I like the kitchen. I like cooking with her in the kitchen. We did that every Thanksgiving. 
I feel like I should come down to say, ""Hey, see I do want to be a part of this family even if I'm really the wierd one, the one that has a mind of her own, the one that is completely different. I still want to be with everyone. Oh and by the way, I'm changing my name, my religion, my location and a few MAJOR goals for the rest of my life.""
I should go. Or not. 
She told me she was going to cook."

"event","After a year in Raleigh, I've decided that this town isn't the one for me. 
But I don't want to leave just quite yet. I figure I should go to school and get a little certificate in something (a useful trade like carpentry!)and head out west. 

That being said, I think I will change my name as well.
Apparently, you can do so for 53.75$ Not that bad at all. 
I have a name picked, but I'll mull over it for a few years.

Work has been sucking recently. I hope they thin the herd and keep the good ones. 
I'm really tired of picking up everyone else's slack.

I saw my first big pile of leaves today.
Oh I wanted to jump in them, but a man with a scary looking rake was staring at me, with a mean little moustache frown.

And, I made a cake today!
But I didn't eat all of it.

Endless pasta bowl is my bff.

"event","Last night I had an unexpected outing with someone who is fantastic and sexy and smart and laughs at my jokes. 
We went to go see an Inconvient Truth together and we were giggly and talked about how to save the world all the way home. 

I invited her to the fair on a whim. She sounded excited. The thing is, I kinda made it seem like it was a whole deli thing and I really don't want anyone else to go, but if they do end up going I can't really be sad? We'll see how it goes.

Thunder woke me up last night. As did two dogs, my neighbor's girlfriend yelling and loud rain.
I need to move. 

I might apply to Kroger sometime to see if they need an awesome cashier for night shift. I think I rock as a cashier. And, the good thing would be even fi I did work night shift, I'd still get out at a decent time (11, maybe midnight). So I could possibly still go out and be social. Which won't really happen, but let's just pretend that it will anyways.

I need to start making my own shifts and painting my own art and creating things.

I made three shelves in akward shapes and I love the way they look, because they are not a sqaure or a rectangle. Straight pointed edges are very very boring. 

Does anyone want a couch? I don't use mine and it takes up to much room. It's free. It's very slender though. Made for people with tiny butts. 

Minituare Schanuzer or Daschund? I can't decide."

I'm proud of myself because today a French customer came in and I held a very short, polite conversation with her-in French! I suppose this would be normal for anybody who actually liked French, but I hated it. Or rather I didn't like the way it was taught. I never had a good French teacher. But three years of having pointless phrases drilled into your head does do you some good.
But I don't think I want to take more French whenever I do get around to going back to school. I thought about Italian.
My mother's last name is better than my fathers. Maybe I should change it to hers. 
Or maybe I should just change my name all together.

I was calling to check up on Corey. Usually it's the voicemail or my father and it's very short and quick.
But today, my sister answered the phone. Now, under my guidance she was turning out alright, but ever since I moved out they've completely have turned her into a crazy conservative who can't think outside the box.
Then I kinda went off a little when she mentioned something about girls who wear dark colors. I don't know. It was some lame little joke and it irked me the wrong way. 
They never call, ever. To check on anything. but then I'm supposed to make plans to go see them, to go on outings with them. My parents have hit the rich stage and life and can easily take time off. My sister has it incredibly easy. 
I just feel like I was born into the wrong family. They just don't get it. They don't get the vegan thing. They don't get the gay thing. They don't get the independent thing. They don't the tattoo, piercing, any modification thing. They don't get why I don't support the war. They don't get why I'm so hard on our president. They don't even watch the news! 
You know what thier latest piece of news was to me?
""Oh, did you know that one our neighbors got a nose job?""
Who the fuck cares? 
I'm talking to puppets here. And then when I say something, they just laugh. ""Oh Marie, you must be wrong.""
.......
Then get let me drive your big fucking truck and run you over.
Oh whoops did that slip out?

I just...I know that everyone doesn't have the same views as me. I don't expect them to. But I like a challenge. They don't present me with one. They just nod and smile and don't go, ""Oh Marie, this is why you're wrong."" They just go, ""That's not right"" and finish up thier green bean cassorole.

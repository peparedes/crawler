"event","I love <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Night_Vale"" target=""_blank""><em>Night Vale</em></a>, but I almost invariably hate the music featured in the Weather.  Mostly acoustic ""singer-songwriter""* stuff with lyrics that are either archly melancholic or snarkily artless.  There are a handful of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebXne0Pl3H8"" target=""_blank"">quite enjoyable</a> exceptions, but mostly I hear that first jangly acoustic chord and it's like a wet tongue on dry construction paper.

What I'm doing about it is: I'm thinking of firing up the old audio editor and cutting out the less-savored Weather songs and replacing them with songs that--<em>to me</em>--better capture the feel of <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em>, and which <em>improve</em> the experience of re-listening to my favorite episodes instead of <em>detracting</em> from it.  Songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCidh3UlaLU"" target=""_blank"">Dance After Curfew</a> by <em>Nash the Slash</em>, or the <em>Lo Fidelity Allstars</em> mix of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B99nd2iKGOw"" target=""_blank"">Battleflag</a>.  Maybe some <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSmrXqJxrSQ"" target=""_blank"">Kid Congo</a>.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbZVdj_d62M"" target=""_blank"">Where Did the Night Go</a> by Gil Scott-Heron is a little short, but otherwise it's a <em>perfect</em> fit.  You get the idea: night music, strange-lights-in-the-sky music.

Why tell you about it, dear LJ?  Because <strong>I'm looking for suggestions</strong>.  Obviously I have some favorites in mind (see the link-fest above), but part of the fun will be having <em>new, interesting music</em> to listen to.  It doesn't have to be hopelessly obscure or esoteric, it just has to have that <em>Night Vale</em> <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/771e70c7984f4a645ed07f8e03a7b0dc/tumblr_ms79feJ7WD1s51bgzo1_r2_1280.jpg"" target=""_blank"">vibe</a>.

So, whether you <a href=""http://podbay.fm/show/536258179"" target=""_blank"">listen to <em>Night Vale</em></a> yourself or not, I'd love to have your recommendations.  Please?  :D

"event","In my <a href=""http://panmodal.livejournal.com/634335.html"" target=""_blank"">earlier post</a> about Samantha Fish, I neglected to mention that the linked videos were performances not by Samantha Fish alone, but by the Samantha Fish Band.  Sam steals the show, but she's not onstage by herself: she's part of a well-balanced trio with bassist Christopher Alexander and drummer Go-Go Ray.

I bring this up now because I've watched videos of Samantha Fish performing with other backing players, and while her solo talent still shines, it just isn't the same--those guys were good enough musicians, I'm sure, but I didn't feel any onstage chemistry.  They might as well have been (and maybe were?) session players hired for the night.

Watching her onstage with Christopher and Go-Go, you can tell you're watching a <em>band</em>.  And there's never any question who the star is--the rhythm section is there to back Samantha up, not to compete for the spotlight.  But they still bring their individual personalities into the mix, and it makes a difference.

So, cheers to the Samantha Fish Band.  *glug*

"event","As you may or may not know, Prince is notorious for the tight grip he holds on his music publishing and performance rights, to the point of sending take-down notices for fan transcriptions of his guitar solos.  Fan forums devoted to <em>The Artist</em> have had to adopt the policy of prohibiting discussion of bootleg recordings, in hopes of avoiding lawsuits.

I'm reading an article right now about his guitar playing, which comments extensively on the frustrations of being a Prince fan and trying to learn his material when he won't publish sheet music, prohibits guitar magazine ""how-to's"" for his songs, and generally beats up the internet for looking at him funny.

The author of the article also provided, apparently in a spirit of naive optimism, a generous selection of YouTube video links.  Let's see how well that turned out:

"event","There is an enormous snowy owl perched on the fence behind my office.  It's really frikkin' cool.

One of my co-workers posted about it on a birding site, and now our parking lot is full of eager birders hoping for a glimpse.  We are far outside the snowy owl's typical range, but this year has seen an abundance of owls <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/10/snowy-owl-influx-a-hoot-for-bird-watchers/3978577/"" target=""_blank"">pushing south</a>.

<strong>""Thinking Ron Paul is a genius because he's anti-war and anti-drug is like thinking a Big Mac is good for you because it has lettuce and a pickle.""</strong>

And for a bonus, please enjoy this hyper-Chandlerized passage from Lee Child's <em>Never Go Back</em>:

<strong>""...and the guy went down so fast and so hard it was like someone had bet him a million bucks he couldn't make a hole in the dirt with his face.""</strong>

Not subtle.  But it gets the job done."

"event","Does <em>""Your call will be given the time and attention it deserves""</em> strike anyone else as being a bit vague and open-ended?  Perhaps <em>conveniently</em> so?

Does each passing minute reflect on the worthiness of my call?

I bet the important calls get better <em>on-hold music</em>.

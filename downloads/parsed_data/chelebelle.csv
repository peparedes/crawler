I jump at the slightest thing. So why then would I insist on watching a movie about zombies and cannibalistic serial killers when I'm home alone? Because I like scary movies? That's part of it but mostly I'm just a stupid, stupid girl."

Or you can send me a check
payable to: American Cancer Society

Also if anyone would like to join my team (I would love that! I need people to hang out with me as most of the people on the team will have to work that day) the relay is June 14th-15th starting at 10am and it's at the Soccer complex behind crossing place apartments where Jen and I used to live. You can register on line by using the link above or just comment here or contact me some other way. If you do want to participate I need to know by June 10th. 

I'm pretty sure most of you have my address and/or phone number if not and you don't want to donate on line let me know here and I'll get you the info."

"event","They say he most likely wont make it through the week, and they're sure this time. 

I feel better about it this time I feel like I said my good bye on Christmas and every time I got to see him after that was a bonus. Last Saturday I was there with my mom and he kicked us out because he wanted to sleep, which still makes me smile. I'm ready for it this time. If he's still alive tomorrow I'm going to see him after work, but if I don't get too I feel alright about it. What I think about right now is his roommate, Arthur, he never has visitors when I'm there and I've been often enough that I should have seen someone. I think about how once Grandpa is gone Arthur won't have all of us coming around to chit chat with while grandpa sleeps. I think about how much he enjoyed it when I would bring Maverick, I would put Mav on his bed so that he could pet him and it seemed to make him happy. Then I think about all the other old people in the hall that would smile when they saw Mav and ask to pet him. 

On February 9th I'm taking Mav to get tested and if he passes (keeping fingers crossed)he will be a certified therapy dog. If (even if it doesn't) that happens I'm going to go visit Arthur and the other old people whenever I can. Arthur saved grandpa before Christmas and gave me the chance to say good bye, I figure the least I can do his let him pet my dog. (that sounds dirty)"

"event","So I got a letter in the mail today from Wal-Mart, apparently they had a screw up in the payroll department that affected the way they calculated overtime pay. They discovered that 87,000 former and current employees had been under paid. I was one of those people. In order to avoid a law suit Wal-Mart is paying what they owe to everyone that was under paid. So I got a big huge whopping check for 65 cents! Apparently they owed me a dollar and after taxes that comes out to 65 cents. I think it will cost me more then that to drive to the bank and cash it."

"event","Today my district manager said to my store manager ""I like her, she's smart."" about me. He said this after I ran some reports for him and did some other things that he had asked for. I wasn't there when he said it but was told about it later. It just made me feel good, like all of my hard work wasn't going unnoticed. I was also told that last Thursday when I was gone all day at a meeting that my store manager was lost without me. So there's some job security for ya. It's nice to have a job that your good at and you don't hate. I still want to get out of retail and into the travel industry but this is a good place to be until that happens and it will look good on my resume."

"event","I think the last time I posted I was about eight, so as you can imagine a lot has happened to me since then.
   
Most importantly after months of searching and going on interviews I have finally found a full time job. I'm now the Administrative Assistant at Dick's Sporting Goods in Eastwood Towne Center. What this means is I run the personnel office, enter the schedules and make sure they are within the payroll budget, order supplies, file a TPS report(seriously I really do) and basically communicate all news between the store and corporate and district offices among other things. I'm excited, yeah it's still retail, but I'm working in the office not on the floor which means very little contact with the customers and I don't have to wear a name tag! The pay sucks, but I get benefits, the hours are great(8-4 Mon-Fri), the job it's self is good and will look great on my resume plus I get to dress up! This of course means I had to go buy new shoes. Because I didn't have a single pair I could wear, except for the three pair I can think of right now off the top of my head. Any way I spent way to much money, but they're cute and I'm excited to wear them!
   
In other news Gwen and I have two new roommates moving in August 24th. They are 19 and 21!!!! This Sucks!!! I'm going to be 27 in a week I do not want to live with a 19 year old! I guess that's what I get for living in college apartments but it's so cheap and with my new fabulously low paying job all I can afford. We plan to go down to the office and see if they can assign someone a little older to live with us before they move in. 19!! I swear if she asks me to buy her alcohol!"

""As this debate goes forward, we must remember that every American deserves to be treated with tolerance, respect and dignity,"" he said. ""All of us have a duty to conduct this discussion with civility and decency toward one another, and all people deserve to have their voices heard.""

Like the tolerance, respect and dignity you show them by not letting them get married because you think it's gross. God I hate him!"

"event","Hey everyone! I'm sitting in an internet cafe in Kavalka Greece surrounded by the rest of my group and WOW posters everyone in here who isent from our group is playing WOW. Yesterday we arived in Athens form Cario, Egypt is unbeliveable I had such a great time it's like an entrily diffrent world over there. Jen and I went into one of the Pymarids rode a camle by the Spynix took a boat ride on the Nile river and saw King Tuts tomb. On one of the nights we went out shopping in the markets it's so funny there were six of us girls walking around with one guy and all the men outside the shops were saying to him ""Oh lucky man six wives, you need vigara?"" and a twelve year old tried to buy me for 50 million camelse, then we took a horse and buggy ride back to the hotel, I thought we were going to die, the driver was going so fast at one point it felt like our buggy was going to flip over but it was great fun. So now we'r back in Greece, it took me sometime to get used to not gettting a marrige propsle everytime I walk past a store but I'm adjusting :)It's Easter here and last night I went out and saw a Greek Orthdox Carmony in this little church then they lit off fireworks and then I went with two people from the group to a night club and satyed out all night, tommorow we we leave for Turkey at 6:15 so I think it's going to be an early night for me. I'm having so much fun I dont think I'm ever coming home. I do miss Maverick maybe I'll get my mom to ship him to me :) Well if I dont get a chance to post before I get home byebye until may 13th."

B)At least once a day I have a little dance party in my head over my upcoming vacation (44 days and counting)

D)I'm taking Karate lessons but I hate when I have to fight people. 
E)Ummmmm....I once shot a man in Reno just to watch him die? no clearly that wasn't me but I did shove a drunk guy in Tennessee and he almost fell on his face.

MDOT is out to ruin my life. 496 looked like a a highway leading out of Texas yesterday and it made me a half hour late to work! A Half hour! it takes me twenty minutes to get to work and I left with plenty of time! This construction has been going on since June and there's never telling what side of the road will be shut down and I have yet to see a significant change to the road. 

Yesterday one of the women I work with was stocking shelves when a customer and her little boy walked by. The little boy asked ""Mommy what is she doing?"" ""She's stocking shelves, thats what you do when you don't go to college."" Excuse me! Can we say bitch? Terry the shelf stocker is actually a semester away from getting her nursing degree. God I hate people who shop at Wal-Mart and act like they are better then the people who work there. Hello, we get paid to be here, whats your excuse?

I'v been watching I love the 90's all day. What was the deal with Crystal Pepsi? It's Pepsi but its clear and it leaves a weird after taste in your mouth! I never got it. Also It would suck to be remembered as Hootie for the rest of your life, but it would be even worse to be a blowfish.

CheleBel1: but I keep kicking to high
shetimberwolf: hahahaha
shetimberwolf: we're not kicking midgets - that's just mean
CheleBel1: lol, hey sometimes midgets need to be kicked
shetimberwolf: Jeff thinks so
CheleBel1: and he would be right, I mean a midget comes and starts talking shit to me and I'm not going to kick the living shit out of him just because he's short I dont think so!
shetimberwolf: Yeah, that's not going to fly at all around here.  We don't take no stinkin' shit from no stinkin' midget!
CheleBel1: that would be discrimination my friend, and I for one am an equal opportunity ass kicker
shetimberwolf: EOAK
shetimberwolf: pronounced E-oak
CheleBel1: I like it, now I just need to make up some patches and get some dues-paying members
shetimberwolf: the patch should have a foot and a midget on it
CheleBel1: getting kicked right in the face
shetimberwolf: perfect!
CheleBel1: ok well now I have to go get ready for work, man I hope a midget comes in today, I'm ready to throw down!
shetimberwolf: BAHAHAHAH
shetimberwolf: perfect.

Auto response from CheleBel1: If a midget is talking shit, then he or she needs an ass kicking, just like a regular sized person.</lj-cut>"

It's always really weird when you see somebody that you used to spend a lot of time with and considered a friend and now you conversations are at first excited and ""Hey how are you?

I was thinking at like 9:30-10ish it's usually pretty dead if you go any early then that. I was also thinking dinner before that, at Bravo in eastwood but it's kind of an expensive place so if no ones intrestd in that part of the evening I understand. So let me know If your intrested (in both or just Sprial, either is fine)."

"event","Bonnaroo is one of those things that you can't really understand until you have lived it, but I'll do my best to describe it.
<lj-cut text=""Bonnaroo"" >After driving all night we arrived in Manchester at about 8:30 a.m.Thursday morning(6/9) and waited in line in our cars along the freeway for about two and a half hours. Moving slow enough that Christina was able to get out and walk along side Lances car. Once we got to our camp site (camp ""Ed Rooney"")and set up Thursday was spent sleeping (after being awake for over 24hours I was out almost as soon as I sat down) and walking around in ""centerroo"" (where all of the stages and big tents are set up) and ""shakedown ally"" (thats where most of the vendors set up to sell, food,tee shirts, posters, drug paraphernalia, ect..) our camp site was right along there. Shakedown is very crowed and very loud but probably the most interesting place out side of centerroo. 

FRIDAY
The morning was spent laying around in the shade tent dozing here and there and watching Gwen apply her sunscreen cocktail (something else you can't really understand until you have lived it). At 2p.m. it was out to centerroo for some music.

JOSS STONE: Better then I expected, she didn't deserve to have her name spelled wrong on that guys tee-shirt.

Lunch where Gwen and I had the first of many Mozzadillas (a quasdailla, with mozzarella cheese, spinach and pesto) to be eaten that weekend.Then the girls went back to camp to rest and we got our first rain for the weekend. 5p.m. Meet Lance at the ""what"" stage, still raining.  

THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND: I kinda felt like I should have been there with my dad. ""I want to have your baby! Oh wait I am your baby!"" (rain)

DAVE MATTHEWS BAND(special guest appearances by Warren Hayes and Robert Randolph): Without a doubt the best Dave Matthews show I'v ever seen (and I'v been to five others) It more then made up for last year and proved once again that Dave Matthews is much better with his band. (rain stopped mid way through)

I learned that it's cool to be up really close but if it means I have to fight my way through the crowd I'm fine with sitting in the back. During the show I almost pushed a drunk guy over, he asked for the way out of the crowd and I just gave him a shove in the right direction. Two girls passed out, people move out of the way quickly when someones carrying a limp body in their arms. Afterward I was ready for the next show but everybody wanted to head back. Back at camp Lance and Christina went to bed and after some coxing from Allison our neighbor and me Gwen headed out with us to see the parade and go to a mardigra party in the comedy tent. Allison turned out to be really annoying and spent the whole time complaining about how her friends ditched her, so the first chance we got we ditched her. After loosing Allison we went over to ""This"" tent to see the second half of Galactic's show, Gwen got tired while we were waiting for them to come on and went back to camp.

GALATIC: Very good probably my favorite of the weekend. Boyd from DMB came out for one song, the dirty dozen brass band did a song and Bo Bice from American Idol (say what you will about that show and the people on it, but this guy can sing) did two songs. I'm very glad I stayed up late by myself to see this show.

3a.m. bed

SATURDAY
Rain and overcast all day and rain at Bonnaroo means mud and lots of it.

Lazy morning, the wash stations are starting to get pretty gross, we go to get breakfast at the place with the really yummy bagel sandwiches ""Do you still have bagels?"" "" Yes, except now we have it all on toast."" ""Toast not bagels, then the answer to my question would be no."" and they added a dollar to the price! Walking around we discovered a place with breakfast burritos and decided to go there on Sunday.""My friend is in jail I need $5,ooo in two days to get him out can you help me?"" More naps and then back out to centerroo. On the way I ate a brownie.

GOV'T MULE and THE BLACK CROWS: These shows are kinda of fuzzy to me, however I did learn that me high and crowds don't mix. ""Gwen asked me how I was feeling and as I was listening to what I was telling her It sounded so ridiculous that I couldn't stop laughing at myself.""

TREY ANASTASIO: Glow sticks galore. Dan I spoke with Trey and explained why you couldn't make it, I held him while he cried and after he calmed down and the hiccups subsided he got out on stage and did his best. But you could tell there was something missing, a little piece of his heart that just wasn't in it. At one point I looked over at the guy standing next to me and with a truly confused look on his face and he said ""Is this really happening? Are we really listening to this? Are we really here?"" I know how you feel buddy.

The rest of the night was spent wandering around being jack asses and amusing ourselves, a stop at the cinema tent for some blue flashy things, a walk around shakedown(honey pops ""Where did this guys come from?"" ""I saw him this morning."" ""Well why didn't you say anything!?"" ""Holy glow sticks in your hair."" ""What do they call people from Arkansas?"" ""Are you from Arkansas?"" nobody was from Arkansas. 

4a.m. bed

SUNDAY
Black clouds and rain all day. Wash stations are really, really gross. We go to get our breakfast burritos.

THE WORD: I enjoy Robert Randolph he makes me happy. But what really made me laugh was the Tubbo Ballerina(not Lance) this guy dancing around like one of the hippos from Fantasia all he needed was the pink too-too

WIDESPERAD PANIC: I danced with a guy in a chicken suit! This show for me was more about watching the people around us like  chicken suit guy, high five guy (I got three high fives and a ""Low five"" on my foot)and topless chick and her bikini clad boyfriend.

I have to say that the whole mooing when your in a large crowd just never gets old, except that it dose and people need to stop doing it. ""Yes that's very funny we'r corralled in here like cattle, thats very original that you mooed nobody has ever done that. Oh and look your friends were watching, thats a moment, that is a memory to be cherished. you have just made a memory here sir!"" ugh, rolls eyes

That night because some of our neighbors had left early leaving a big open spot in the field our campsite became nitrous central. There are certain things that I never need to do and sitting in a muddy field sucking nitrous oxide out of a balloon is one of them. I saw a guy my dads age doing it I really just wanted to tell him to get a life. 

MONDAY
We pack up and just in time for us to leave the sun comes out.
On the way out there was a nice man standing on the side of the road with a sign informing all of us evil sinners that if we didn't find Jesus we were going to Hell just like Jim Morrison, John Lennon and Jerry Garcia and I figured it sounds like they have pretty good music in Hell so I guess I'll just stay on my evil, sining path.

We all stopped at the Jack Daniels distillery and did the tour then headed into Lynchburg to get our free(cheap-ass plastic) shot glasses. Then we walked around the WHOLE town it took us at least four minutes, maybe even five. Then after some ice cream and checking out the local park we went our separate ways. Lance and Christina home to Michigan, but not before stopping to see the caves.</lj-cut>

Gwen and I too Nashville

<lj-cut text=""Nashville"" > Monday night we went to the Opryland hotel, took a boat ride on the river inside the hotel and then got lost in the jungle, drank some bug juice and did a reenactment of that scene in Labyrinth where Jennifer Connelly is running up and down the stairs and she can see where she wants to go but cant get to it. The place is frigging huge. Then we went to bed at 9p.m. intending to nap for only an hour and then go out to the bars. When we woke up at 8a.m. we decide it was a little to early to be drinking so we got breakfast instead.

Tuesday we took a tour of Nashville, we saw the capitol, The Parthenon(they have an exact replica of the one in Greece) The Ryman theater and the country music hall of fame (where we met a couple from K-zoo who had been at bonnaroo). I'm not a big country music fan but it was still interesting(Billy Ray Crius is in the hall of fame?!) That night we went to every bar that was open. 
Some of the highlights

WannaB's: a karoke bar, think Crunchys but instead of the drunken idiots you have people who can really sing. Like Jim who looks like an insurance salesmen and Neil Diamond fan and then got up and did ""Enter Sandman"", ""White Wedding"" and ""Ballroom Blitz"".

Coyote Ugly: we danced on the bar and I got sprayed even though it was Gwen who ordered water!

Bar Nashville: it was eighteen and over night and we got hit on by a guy with gray hair. We didn't stay long.

Sam and Ryan: very cute, very drunk and Sam very gay. Oh and they had been at Bonnaroo 

Larry, Mo and Curly: we never did get their names but thats ok it's more fun to call them this. They tried to give us lessons on how to talk like a southerner.

The guys from Michigan: they were there on business, they sell silicone and really wanted us to come back to their hotel if only they could remember where it was. Ummm no thanks.

The guy in the white cowboy hat: cute, less cute without the hat.

Bars in Nashville close at 3a.m. but Tuesday night is not the best night to go. 

WEDNESDAY
Spent in the car, Gwen decided she wanted to drive the whole way so I entertained her by watching the clouds through the sun roof, and getting a bit loopy from being in the car for so long. ""want to play yellow car?"" ""Sure, parking lot full of buses!""</lj-cut>


It was a great trip, lots of memories(like the guys mooing in the crowd I won't forget the millions of times that happened *rolls eyes*)I didnt get as tan as last year (maybe because there was no sun) and I didn't get as dirty as last year (there was less mud)and not for lack of trying Nashville did not turn out like D.C. but it was still fun."

"event","gwenivere told me that  darkwing_duck told  msjellybean that I got caught talking to  mrstevo and talking crap about  star_scream. That's bullshit!   

Hey and know what? I was supposed to get together with people Friday but I don't want to anymore. I'm so tired of seeing the same people. 

Oh yeah. it's so not fair that I have Wednesday off but nobody wants to do anything :-(. I'll just sit home alone and cry.

I am so going to kick  jackrussell out of the house. They wore my favorite furry shirt when  candles721 and  fosian_theory was visiting. I've never been so embarassed in my life! 

I am so lethargic!  someone at work found out I was into trekkie stuff and I think that's why I got fired :-(.  

Hey and know what? everybody has asked why I'm leaving the goth community but the answer is simple: Some of you know who you are and why I'm leaving FOREVAR.

Oh and we get to keep D.C. as our capitol because Kerry won 90% of the vote there. The capitol, the place where the President lives doesn't even want Bush there anymore and he still won! So what should we call our new country? If this doesn't work I'm moving to Canada."

"event","Ok today i had to drive my great grandpa and grandma to Beaumont Hospital for his check up.  So his appointment is at 1:00 and we get there around 12:30.  We had to wait and hour and a half before he even went into the room.  Then we had to wait and hour before he came out again.  Man I was Bored!!!!  Then there was this teenage girl who went out of the room and came back.  So when she came back i had my legs stretched out bcz i was cramping up.  So i moved them in to let her through and of course she says ""thank you.""  Then I look at my great grandmother and she taps me going "" ha ha.""  She thought i was flirting with her by moving my legs for her to get through,  I thought that was pretty weird.  Last night me and my friend Chris went out to see Evolution.  That was really funny.  That guy in the sprite commercial is really funny.  

   Man i am really sore.  I had to go play lacrosse this evening and lift.  During the game i should of had at least 7 goals But i just couldnt put the ball in the net.

"event","Music expresses feeling whether it be sadness, anger, or pleasure.  Just as it expresses feeling it effets people in the same way.  It can make some cry, feel happy, or pump people up for athletic events.  A definition of music in the dictionary is ""... as to form structually complete and emotionally expressive compositions.""
  Also music means something special to all of us.  A good example would be how a husband and wife always have ""their"" song.  Music also expresses what kind of person we are.  In conclusion, music is in all of us.  So what does yours say about you?"

"event","Ok my weekend started off very slowly.  First, i had to take the ACT's.  That took soooooo long.  First of all i was tired and second some parts were impossible.  The one part that really took forever was the reading.  In that part there were four stories and the first two were soo confusing and made absolutely no sense.  Also to add on to that there was a lawnmower outside and we had the door open.  So i could not concentrate.  Then they added a fifth test which pissed me off bcz there was only supposed to be four.  Luckily it wasnt graded bcz i got an impossible math section that i had no clue what to do so i just started to fill in ovals.  Then my weekend got much better.  After the test i went home for a while and just for you Amber I watched Golden Girls.  Then i drove an hour to my cottage and man was i tired.  Anyway once i got there i had sooooo much fun.  First i started  to do some casting off my dock ( where i thought there was no fish but i was wrong) and i caught a northern pike.  Needless to say i was very happy.  Then we went down to my uncle's cottage and hung out there and the weirdest thing happened.  It started to snow.  well not really the seeds or something on the willow tree were blown off by the wind and it looked like it was snowing steadily for at least 15 minutes.  That was cool.  Then today started off well.  Me and my cousin decided to go fishing and i immediately caught two perch and then nothing and we let the perch go.  Then i had to go cut my grandma's cottage grass.  Then i decided to go on my cousins jet ski.  that wasnt smart. it wasnt that the water was cold even though it was ( i wore a wet suit that didnt really fit me but it worked)  it was that it was a stand up jet ski and i couldnt stand up.  i kinda fell a lot.  Then after that it rained and that ruined the day but now i am here and good and thats great in my book.  catch ya on the flip side!


( oh ya amber is this long enough to get on your friends list?)"

"event","This week really sucked.  First my game at Novi an Tuesday gets rained out so we drive all the way there for absolutely nothing.  Then we go back on Thursday and i was promised that i would play.  Well guess what, I didn't that really pisses me off.  Now I'm felling a little sick, hopefully thats just the weather.  All in all i would have to say that this week was horrific.  Hopefully my weekend will be better.  Wait scratch that my weekend will definitely be better, because I'm gonna make it better.  So a word of advice Never listen to your coach and if you actually get in the game shoot shoot shoot so you can score and make sure you hit someone as hard as you can!"

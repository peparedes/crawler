Last year.
So close to being done!
I'm already thinking about moving, even though I have no idea where I'm moving to.
Thinking about a new apartment, a new vehicle, what I'm going to actually DO when I move, and so-on and so-forth, blah blah blah. 
I just have to make sure I can get all my classes crammed into one academic year without failing any... that might be tough.
That is all.
Cheers to the future.

Reading some of my reeeeallly old entries makes me embarassed. Ick. So I've made quite a few of them either friends only or just private. It's a good thing no one reads this!

The fedex man brought me something pretty awesome today. Thanks Kenton Muffinbutt. :)

So much has changed since I wrote in this last.. or since any of those old entries that I just never updated.
Reading them makes me want to talk to some of those people again.. like a certain someone that needs to still call me. I haven't actually talked with you for maybe over a year, easily.

Muffinbutt flies in on August 8th... so soon! We're gonna pet some bears at the bear country, ride the bikes at the 'deen, and dance the nights awayyyyy.

I'm almost done with lame-o school. Next May is when I planning to be done... then who knows what.

I'm dying without air conditioning right now... it's god spiting me for not going to class today.

I'm rambling."

Tomorrow I go back home to get ready to leave for Victoria, BC Canada.
I'm so excited.. but I'm more excited about another trip now.

On Aug 18th, I leave to go to Madison, IN for 4 days.
This is the biggest adventure for me.
I'm scared and happy and sooo anxious and excited all at the same time.
I can't wait.

"event","Sonshine was awesome. The shows were great... showering only once in 4 days... weather in the 90s every day... 200 degree tents... awesome. :) I made new friends too. Jon, Jeff, Aaron, Pete, and I got to know the Aberdeen crew a bit better. Amber is such a sweetheart. She gave me a cute butterfly ring from the booth she was working at there. Red From Winter played and that was super effin exciting. They're so much fun!!

Well the countdown til school starts. I only have 6 more days left in Watertown. Then I take off for Omaha for a few days just for a visit. I'm seeing Hatebreed, Throwdown, Opeth, and God Forbid on that Wednesday. Thank God for cheesy toughguy hardcore. On Thursday I'm seeing As I Lay Dying, Himsa, Remembering Never, and Shadows Fall. On August 13 or 14 I'll be back in Rapid once again til the 27th. 

This summer went wayyyy too fast. I did a lot and saw a lot of people though, so I'm happy with it. WAY better than the summer after my freshman year... that was the worst.

The show on sunday night went alright. I need to buy an actual pick up for my violin though. The mic idea wasn't so great, but it was all we had at the time. The ""joke"" song that i didn't play on didn't go as planned.. the drumset fell off the platform haha. Oh well. It just made it that much funnier. The rest of the bands that night played well, but I got bored... I spent most of the time meeting people I haven't ever really talked to before, which was cool. I also found out The Great Redneck Hope is playing in Pierre on the 23rd... I must go. I'm so pumped for that! :)

Oh! Even better news... Hot Cross is back in SD on October 16th!! I'm going... I don't care WHAT's going on at school this time... I'm not missing it. Malady's playing in SD sometime in October too... should be fun!

Well I'm done writing for now. I'm tired and paralyzed from the teeth down, so goodnight all.

this is fun:

"event","So, life is interesting yet again... only when I write in this is it actually somewhat interesting though.

Spring break back home has been pretty fun with my good friend from school. She's enjoying herself too, so it's all good. We're going to see The Passion of the Christ tomorrow, and I'm super scared to see it.. I heard it's brutal. I cut and dyed my hair while I've been home... it's quite a change... no more blonde for me any more. My friend and I have been keeping busy around town, so I've been able to keep my mind KINDA off of certain things.

I think I really messed things up with a certain individual in my life. They won't talk to me anymore, and it hurts... a lot. I know I screwed up, but I want to at least be able to talk to them again... maybe then I could straighten things out a bit... maybe. I don't want it to be like this. I miss them. I want them to know that I really do care too, no matter how much it may seem like I don't sometimes. They're very important to me. I want them to know that, but if they keep ignoring me, I feel like I can't get through to them at all. I've apologized and asked for forgiveness, so there's nothing else I can really do except to just wait and pray that they have it in them to speak to me again soon. :(

Until next time..."

"event","All is well here in my world. I'm talkin to my friend on the phone. He's telling me some INTERESTING shiat. haha. It's funny, but no good.

I just got back from Minneapolis yesterday. My friend and I went to a show on Friday in Owatonna. We were late though cuz the weather was complete shit, and we had so many close calls on the ice. We made it just in time for The Crowning Sacrifice's last song (the last minute or so of it). It sounded great from what we heard. Then, Red From Winter played. It was awesome. They're all kids still in high school, but they're really effin good. The lead vocalist looked like Edward Scissorhands.. his hair was all nappy and huge. It looked like he had got struck by lightening. His face started bleeding all over after like the first song... crazy. It was somewhat screamo with keyboards also. It was different, but I like it a lot. I bought their cd and ""Hot Damn"" Every Time I Die from the traveling distro at the show. We got to talk to the infamous Ryan after the show. :) He's one of the guitarists for The Crowning Sacrifice. He's the one who hooked me up with the recording project with them. We stayed at his house in St. Paul this weekend. He's a great guy... super nice and hilarious. He pretty much showed us around all weekend when we weren't at his house or at the shows. We hung out with Joe (the drummer) and Andy (vocalist) also a few times. On Saturday, we went to the Senses Fail/The Beautiful Mistake/Moneen/Folly show at The Quest in downtown Minneapolis. The show ended up selling out, so Ryan and Joe couldn't come with us. They just hung out around the area until the show was over. Earlier on Saturday, Ryan took us to Extreme Noise. Holy shnikes, I like that place a lot. I found You and I ""The Curtain Falls""!! I was pumped about that. I also bought Books Lie ""It's A Weapon"" and Circle Takes the Square ""As the Roots Undo""... all of which are effin good. Ryan also burned me the new Walls of Jericho and ""Satellite Years"" and the E.P. from hopesfall. What a guy :)
His mom left my friend and I notes in the bathroom telling us where our towels were.. it was funny. I enjoyed that much.
That night at his house we watched the video from the Friday show of The Crowning Sacrifice. They sound awesome.. I can't wait to record with them.
On the way home from Minneapolis, my friend made a wrong turn and we ended up way more North than we were supposed to.. hah oh well.. made for an interesting drive. All in all, I had a really awesome weekend just hanging out with some cool people.

toodles!"

"event","what a weird day. I hardly had any classes, so I just sat in my dorm room being antisocial and listening to music like usual. I felt like I had been in here forever... I needed to get out of my room SOOO badly, so I went to go practice my violin. I think it helped a bit. I have to go to work at 4. Usually I'd be dreading work, but I need to get off my ass for the rest of the day. I'm going to The Butterfly Effect with Rob, Alison, Andrew, and a bunch of other people later tonight, so maybe that'll get my mind off of things. Let's hope.
So I might record with a band called The Crowning Sacrifice. They're gonna send me a rough recording of one of their new songs for their full-length so I can play around with it on my violin and write some. I can't wait for that.
That's all I really want to write about at the moment.

"event","Wow, I never thought I'd do one of these, but I finally broke down and got an account. I'm such an internet whore! Hah. Anyway, I guess I should talk about life.
     Well I just got back from my friend Rob's house. Rob, Andrew, and Alison were all over there. We didn't do much. Andrew complained about his stupid parents, annoying school, gay music, money, and other various things. He was in a pretty shitty mood today... I felt bad. I would feel awkward having a serious conversation about his life though. I think I'd feel like I was just in the way. I wanted to cheer him up, but I honestly don't know how to cheer up someone who's living in their own personal hell :(
     On a better note, I bought a Waifle cd today... ""The Music Stops. The Man Dies."" It was recommended to me, so when I saw it today, I bought it. It's not too shabby. I like it. Yesterday I downloaded Soulseek, so I've been DLing like a mothafucka for these few days. It's great.
     So I was talking to Charlie today and I think I pissed him off... I feel really bad. I have this really bad habit of trying to multitask when I'm on the internet and talking to people. It just doesn't work. He felt neglected I think, so he didn't wanna talk to me anymore for the night :\ That's when I left for Rob's house.
     Now I'm going to shut off this stupid computer that has been on for days, and then I'm going to bed so I can sleep for a good 3 hours before class.

"event","Yay! I finally remembered to make an entry! Today I walked 3 miles. Tomorrow I'm planning to go 5 or 6. 

A little question for everybody (just to get some discussion going): How fast is everyone walking? I'm going about 3 mph, and I'm hoping thats about normal. I don't want to show up at the walk and be left in everyone's dust!

Have a good day!"

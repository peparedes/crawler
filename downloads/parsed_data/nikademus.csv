"event","If ya did not know I will be arriving back in Seattle around the 11th of August. I will most likely be crashing at Connors or Kellys for a week till i can get stuff situated and get the job hunt rolling. Not making any promises as to how long i will be staying in Seattle, alot depends on how things go the first week. I may just decide its been nice, say hi to everyone and then leave again. We will see...


Until then, stock up on the nuggage and the beers... its going to be an interesting first week back, to say the least."

"event","I think the life cycle is backwards: 
You should die first, start out dead and get it out of the way. 
Then you wake up in an old age home, feeling better every day. 
You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, 
then, when you start work, you get a gold watch on your first day. 
You work 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. 
You drink alcohol, you party, you're generally promiscuous and  you 
get ready for High School. 
You go to primary school, you become a kid, you play, you have no 
responsibilities, you become a baby, then, you spend your last 9 
months floating peacefully with luxuries like central heating, spa, room 
service on tap, larger quarters everyday, and finally you finish  off 
as an orgasm. 

I rest my case.  :)"

I am sure all of you have seen news coverage but believe me when i say that what ever you have seen in the papers or on TV is nothing compared to the reality of the situation down there. Saw a picture today in the local paper of a casino that had been pushed 500ft off its foundation. Now this is not a small building and to see where it was and where it is now was pretty crazy. Also any of you that can help please do so, money, canned food, phone cards, prepaid cellphones/cell minute cards, anything. 

Ok thats enough of that. Depending on what happens in the next week i should be back in Seattle around the middle of Oct. Got some more traveling to do before i head back regardless of whether or not i go down to help out."

Will probly end up doing a Greyhound tour of the country to visit relatives on this coast while i am here. Been an interesting four months to say the least, spent the first three months trying to overdoase my liver and the last one trying to recouperate it before i head back into the rest of humanity. I have to say that the hardest thing to get over when i leave here will be engaging in the Maine state sport... What is the Maine State sport u are asking... well in usually involves a case or two of cheap beer of a bottle of ""Hick Juice"" aka Allens Coffee Brandy and a car... yep drunken driving seems to be what most of these hillbillies do for fun out here... well for those of u who care i should be back in Washington around the end of Sept or early Oct.

http://www.gunsanddope.com/

check this site out, some really funny stuff... here is an excript from the editorials page....\


"" GUNS and DOCTORS

a. The number of physicians in the United States is 700,000

b. Accidental deaths caused by Physicians per year is 120,000.

c. Accidental deaths per physician is 0.171. (US Dept. of Health &
Human Services)

THINK ABOUT THIS:

a. The number of gun owners in the US is 80,000,000 (yes, eighty- million!).

b. The number of accidental gun deaths per year (all age groups) is 1,500.

c. The number of accidental deaths per gun owner is .0000188.

Statistically, doctors are about 9,000 times more dangerous than gun owners.

FACT: NOT EVERYONE HAS A GUN, BUT ALMOST EVERYONE HAS A DOCTOR.

Alert your friends to this threat. We must ban doctors before this
gets out of hand.

As a public health measure I have withheld the statistics on lawyers
for fear that the shock could cause people to seek medical attention."""

Taunting cops the Zodiac Killer would send in encrypted messages to the local papers, describing how his past victims had died, and who would come next if they didn't post his message on the cover of the newspaper the following day. The only surviving witness described the zodiac killer as a heavy set man in a self fashioned hooded jacked that covered his face, brandishing a crossed circle that he always signed his letters with.

"event","Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed tonight shortly after 10pm in Columbus, Ohio. About the only good news is the reported gunman was killed in the incidant. The fact that today was the aniversery of john lennon's assassination, and the fact the DbD was publicly noted to be a great admirer of Lennon, this can not be a coincidance. Or can it?

Congratulations on being the creator of a new
Evil Plan (tm)!

Your objective is simple: World Domination.

Your motive is a little bit more complex: Love (Yes, it works)

Stage One
To begin your plan, you must first assassinate a rock star. This will cause the world to sense a grave disturbance in the force, unsettled by your arrival. Who is this demented madman? Where did he come from? And why does he look so good in classic black? 


Stage Two
Next, you must seize control of the White House. This will all be done from a underground secret headquarters of doom, a mysterious place of unrivaled dark glory. Upon seeing this, the world will spontaneously combust, as countless hordes of ninjas hasten to do your every bidding. 


Stage Three
Finally, you must send forth your armies of destruction, bringing about horrors beyond man's comprehension. Your name shall become synonymous with sheer dementedness, and no man will ever again dare steal your woman. Everyone will bow before your mind-boggling insanity, and the world will have no choice but to fall madly in love with you.

You to can create your own evil plan... Join me... Join the Dark Side"

Man i really need to stop drinking before i go to bed. the dreams are interesting to be sure but i have enough emotional shit to deal with when i am awake dont need my subconscious joining in on the party. I mean really I almost felt worse waking up than when i finally passed out. of course that could just be the hangover but i doubt it.

My best friend is thrown in jail on a bogus child molestation charge, his rotten cunt of a girl friend gets me fired. a very good friend of mine decides that it is time to check out and hangs himself. There are times when i want to ask myself whats the point? BUT when you start asking questions like that you want to answer them, when you can find the answers you just get more frustrated. God i want my life to be simple again. I have to say that if it wasnt for a few very close friends i would have probably gone on to the planet Arcturus by now. I mean fuck... i just want off this rock one way or another. 

ok now that that is out of my system and i have a few shots in me... I get to rejoin the work force on Tuesday. yay me. I get every kids dream job. Playtesting video games. WEEEEEEEEE but hey its a job and it pays the bills. eat breathe shit repeat...

ok I am done for the night... to anyone who reads this shit... I am sorry... ya coulda been doing something entertaining."

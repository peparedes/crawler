"event","Ahhhh so another successful lan party. It went off better then I thought. When I heard that we had to keep the noise level to a minimum I thought for sure that we were going to get a couple of complaints. But no, zero. I have to say, singing ""I'm gonna keep on lovin' you"" by REO Speedwagen in Chris' truck with 3 other guys was one of the most heterosexual experiences of my life. HA. I think that the only people we were missing were Stan, Mark, and Jeff from the usual LAN crew. I think this picture pretty much sums the night up nicley:

Other news:
Mr. Kantor has not gotten back to me letting me know what I got on my second project. I know it's going to be a good grade because I used CSS when we havent really learnd any. Excell is going good. I have 100 on everything except test #2 and I only got 2 wrong. The class average was 9 out of 13 I think. They all suck. They fail on the tutorials, the DO IT RIGHT FROM THE FUCKING BOOK tutorials. Math is a bitch, because the teacher makes it a bitch. No one does any work and he always is scolding us for some reason or another. Also he can't teach worth a damn. He is one of thost ajuncts that really doesn't give a shit weather anyone passes or fails. I got 110 on project 2 for web design and management. Not bad. 

For once this semester I really don't have any work to do right now. I could go on in web programming but I'm not really feeling motivated enough to do so. I think Im just gonna sit here, in the bottom of the library, and play with the sodaplay constructer till I get kicked out, again. 

Also I can't wait to get out of here and pick up Galatic Civ 2. From what I have been reading on the GC web forums there are some minor bug being reported but nothing too serious. I hope theres still a copy there when I get out of here."

This semester is starting to become very hetitc, Im only in 4 classes but there is so much work to do for all of them. No matter how much time I spend in the library I never seem to get much done. Went to deli and brew with kasey the other day that was pretty fun.

I'm really looking forward to the LAN on saturday. I need to blow off some steam.

Good thing we only started organizing those games till the last 2 weeks of the semerter hahaa. I will miss the casual everyday for 2 weeks straght LANS. 

Still waiting on my fucking report card. I know I have As in math and english, and prolly Bs in psych and business law. Not to shabby for ammount of effort I put into them. So i fucked things up with that girl. I never fucking asked her for a screen name or her number or anything... stupid stupid stupid. Oh well, hopefull I'll see her next semester. 

I'm starting to get really psyched about the CAD LAN. I can't wait. Jeff is going now so it will be nice to see him. 

Didn't take too long for my sleep schedual to become really fucked up again. Sleep at 4 am, wake at 2 pm..... nice.
I'm starting to take a look at my programming book again. Trying to learn what I missed and/or didn't care about. functions, arrays, and pointers... FUCKING POINTERS... I don't even know why im so drawn to C. I suck at it. I know I'll get it eventually.

"event","Wow, Id almost forgettn I had this thing still. And how badass it looks with the pirate flag, red text and black background. Props to shana for coding it way back. 

Well I'm back in school (for the third time), its going pretty well.. My math class is.... insulting at best. Business Math with Mrs. Stuges, who treats us like were all still in middle school. Its really awful, today we went over more multiplication of fractions and converting mixed numbers back into fractions (for real, thats what we did for 50 min), fucking pathetic. Thats and easy A right there. I had to do a presentation in General Psych. today, that went pretty well for an autobiography for myself. I basically got up there and talked about computers and the internet for 10 min. And I got away with showing the infamous Ford Sportika comercial. That was pretty sweet, all the girls in the class look appaled: Mission Accomplished. It was a demonstration in perseption; how people see and dicide what they like and don't like through visual stimlus. The class was torn 50/50 over weather they liked or not. I got props from the teacher for showing it, Mr. Ostwald, hes a pretty cool guy. 

Its really hard to go to school this semster with not taking any computer classes and all. I currently have 1 skip in math.. I took that hour to finish up my psych. presentation so I don't really feel bad about it. Im not really worried about failing that class. But I have less then 3 skips to be exempt from the final so Im gonna try and be there for the rest of the semester. Business law is alright, just going over stuff I learned in high school law right now. Stare Decisis, long arm statue, jurisdiction and courts. The teacher is pretty awsome. English is going to give me some trouble this semester. I have it for three hours straght on fridays. That in itself sucks, but to add onto that the teacher is some burt out aging hippy. The second week we had class she about had an anurism becuase no one did the reading from last week. So  my plan is to suck up to get at least a B. She seems to like me so I don't think that its going to be a problem. 

I finally got around to installing Fedora on my spare tower the other day. I have to say im very intregued my it. I had flashbacks to UNIX class with Mrs. Hart with I started working in the terminal hahaha. Its pretty easy to get used to but some of the syntax in the bash shell is different from what I'm used to so I have to get used to that. I try to stray away from using GNOME because command line is more 1337. Going to try and SSH into it from school tommarow so that should be interesting. 

Well thats about it, my summer was spent working at Alteri's. I make decent money and its something I like doing so its not that bad there. Right now I'm saving up to get a decent lappy. Speaking of lappy, I better pull out my current one for monopoly tommaorw. Oh man, aparently the laptop was a load bering structure on my dresser so now I have a mess on my hands....

Then I dropped her off at Electra's and said hi to Farrell, Electra and this other kid that was there. I don't know his name but he likes Axis and Allies so hes automatically cool. Yeah I haven't gotten any sleep in 2 days. I running on empty but its awsome cuz its like im hanging out with all my old friends, Lea, Tom, Blair, Derrick, and everyone. I don't care how much sleep I loose its just awsome that these people are back in my life, praticularly Lea, cuz she is such an awsome person. 

So the past few nights I spent at Blairs playing Axis and Allies from midnight untill 6am when we can get MCDonnalds breakfast. Pat is praticularly fond of those. (Pat O'shea). Today I worked untill 2:30 then went fishing with Pat. Billy showed up at whiteperch pond and we hung out for awhile. Then he showed us this awsome new fishing spot called Fawn Lake. We fished there and I got this hit that completly bent my rod down and snapped my line. Keep in mind I have a deep sea fishing rod. Whatever it was, was very very big. I can't wait to go back and catch that bastard.

So yeah a lot had happened since my last update. Me and Kasey are done. ::sigh:: I know deep down its not true, but I can't help but feel that I was played.. again. I dunno, this always seems to happen to me, I think, no I know, that I have something special but then poof, its gone. It happened with Farrell, then Lea,(Well that was my fault), and now Kasey. I just hate feeling like this. Iv really felt like this for too long. I just wish I could find someone that cares about me as much as I care about them, you know, enought to forsake all others and such. I dunno, I just really need to be loved I guess. Im just used to it because pretty much all the relationships I'v had were serious ones. I dunno, single again, it sucks but ill get over it.

Yestaday me and John, one of the chefs, went fishing and it was cool cuz we talked about real issues and stuff other then work. I mean hes 30 and I'm 18 so its cool that he considers me a friend. I cought a bullhead and a fucking bastard eel. I hate those things. Its funny cuz hes a lot deeper then I thought he was. I guess looks can be deciving. Ha, when he was in my house and saw my room he just broke out in laughter because of how small it is. It may be small but its definatlly mine. 

Today started off shitty cuz John was late and two delivers had to be left outside and I had to take both of them in. That really sucked cuz there were a lot of boxes of liquer.. heavy ass liquer. Then I had to drop off catering at CSEA on washington ave. right off lark and when I got there the russian dressing was all over the inside of the truck. Some asshole pulled out in front of me and it spilled everywhere. Then I get back finish up and go fishing. That gave me some time to really think. After that I went back to work in a really shitty mood so the rest of the night pretty much sucked.

The day started off alright, I went fishing with Pat all morning, then at 2:10 I picked up Kaseys and we chilled till like 6:30 cuz she had to eat. I did some more fishing then picked her up again at 8:30. We went to delmar to pick up Wendy then off to Wal-Mart. I dunno, in wal-mart i just got overcome with depression. It's really hard to explain. I just bascially walked around blindly for the whole time. Then we drove my normal cruze route through coymens and ravena and back to albany. I had to stop at PC cuz I felt like my brain was gonna leek out my nose. I got some tylenol and popped some of that. I don't even know how many I took. Then I passed out in my car and Kasey and Wendy chatted it up while I was dozing. All I remember hearing is something about a cute boy, and going to steves house.. After they woke me up I dropped them off and drove home. On the way home I was twitching and felt like driving my car into a telephone poll. I dunno, im just not happy I guess.

I saw Eddie and Sean there, I haven't seen them since high school. They took most of the crappies for bait. And off to work. 

Friday was one of the best nights that I'v had in awhile. I went to Kasey's house and chilled from like 4:30 till after midnight. We basically beat each other up the whole time, which was cool. I wish I had more nights like that one... She fell asleep in my arms.. I dunno why i think thats so special, but I do. She makes me feel all wonderful inside. Its such an indescribable feeling. Its something that I haven't felt in a long long time. 

Well time for bed..."

I got really mad at it when it was telling me there was no CD in there but there was. Then I took it out (the CD) put it back in and shut it really hard and like 4 springs flew out of it and the CD broke. Im such an ass. Which leads me to my next topic : I have wild moode swings. Like I was really happy then I fliped out and broke my DVD rom. I really hate that. I'v had it ever since I was little. I get really destructive in betten the swings. Thats why I can't have nice things. I dunno, I should learn to control my emotions more, but you know me, I never learn. 

Today was cool cuz I only had to work 10-3. Then I went fishing with Val in the boonies and then to Denny's. Then I got to chill with Kasey. So yeah today was pretty awsome. Oh, Also i found $120 in my pocket, so bling bling. Mabye I'm just overreacting with this thing with Kasey but, I dunno. I hate myself sometimes. It's just I want to do everything to make her happy. Everything. I just care about her soo much. I dunno, I should really calm down. I'm getting all angry at myself now. 

I think I should sleep....

not much has changed since i last updated but whatever. Last night I went to see kill bill vol.2 which kinda sucked but was good cuz i was with kasey. we didn't get into the 11:00 showing so we ended up going to the 12:30 showing. we didn't get out untill a little before 3. There were these really annoying black people in the theater that kept talking and wouldn't shut up. I was gonna say something but i was kinda tired\ having a breakdown, and there were like 10 of them. Today I hung out with kasey in the park which was cool cuz i got to get outside and have some fun before work.

I think im about to have a mental breakdown. i don't want to sound like a bitch or anything but everything is becoming so much harder for me to deal with. I mean the littlest thing can set me off and ill be in the worst mood for the rest of the day. Like i can think of what i have to do the next day and ill be in a shitty moode. I dunno. I'm just at that point where you just don't care anymore. I really just don't give a shit anymore. About stuff that once really mattered to me. Like my cooking at work has really gone down. It might seem like something little to you, but this is something I was once really passionate about. Now I really don't even know how i got the motivation to build the computer that im writing this with right now. Right now I only really care about two things : Kasey, and my friends. I dunno.

I just feel like theres nothing I can do to make her feel better and it drives me crazy. I relly hate seeing her like that.

"event","Man tonight was one of those nights that you never want to end.

I had to work in the morn but then when I picked up Kasey everything just got so much better. We hung out at her house for awhile and watched MXC and scrubs. Then we chill at the town park and just talked. Like one of those deep conversations. Then we picked wendy up and went to the mall. We went to ::sigh:: Hot Topic, Torrid, T.J. Maxx, and then we went to TSX. Thats when I saw her... Farrell was all of a suddon standing right in front of me. I just had this major feeling of anxisity and then she said wheres Lea. At that point I had to leave. I'm really afraid of what Lea is gonna say to me. ::sigh:: I have to get over this sometime. I dunno. But still a really good night. Then we picked James up and went to Wal-Mart and basically destroyed the store. After that we went to James' house and hung out in his yard. As he went to put his car into the driveway (Wendy had been sitting on it) he got the great idea to floor it. Wendy falls off the car and smashes her head on the concrete. We help her up and she can't even stand up straght. I really really hope shes ok.

I can honestly say I had the most fun tonight then I'v had in a long time. I got to spend a majority of the day with Kasey. I love her to death. I can't get rnough of her to be honest. I really need more nights like this one to bring me back to life in a sense. To get the feeling of day in day out work bullshit out of me. It's gonna happen. I'm gonna make damn sure of it."

The was cool was Keith tought me how to make a sausage veal pepper mushroom dish. And some other basic lunch dishes. I don't think I'm ready for a dinner tho. Also I got a make a chicken gumbo soup which came out really good.

 Then Keith let me go earley cuz hes cool like that and I got to see Kasey. That was really fun. Just chillin in Henry Hudson park, just holding each other. It was awsome. I dunno why but I'v really been missin hangin with the old crew lately. I miss being at Lea's house with John, Farrell, Elecktra, Lea and Shana just hangin. Those were the good ol' days. ::Sigh:: Then I had to go and fuck everything up. I know thats never gonna happen again (Us chillin). It's all my fault. I should have gone out with Lea. For one it was really the wrong time in my life to have a gf. Im sorry lea. Second it just fucked everything up more between me and John. I just wish I could turn back time, I'd do things a little differently. There is one good thing that came out of that mess. I got back together with Kasey. Avutally thinking about it I don't think I'd do things differently. I'm happy with Kasey. More then happy. ::sighL:: i dunno, I guess I really just miss being friends with them.

"event","Yeah so I have my heart set on a new computer. Well not really new just a few new major components. I looked at motherboards today and I can get a pretty nice one for around 100-150$. Thats with 8x AGP so it will take full advantage of my video card. Also it supports DDR ram up at 400mhz bus which make for a super fast compy. A 512mb stick of PC 3200 Ram i can get for around 100 also so thats not bad. The processor will be around 140 for an AMB Athalon XP 2800+ so thats cool. Everything else I need I can salvage from my current computer. I can't wait. Also I'm gonna need a new hard drive. I think I really fucked the one I have now up. Bad. Val is gonna be cool and let me have a case to put this in. A nice one at that. The only thing I have reservations on is heat sinking. I don't have much experience with all that and I don't know how to properly heat sink a computer that new. I'll have to do more reasearch. It's gonna be a bitchin machine when I'm done.

Man I saw the funniest thing at work today. This guy was pulling out to leave and his tire fell right off his car. Thats not even the best part. He managed to get the tire back on only to drive 10 or 15 feet only to have another one fall off. Man that was great. We also got this new guy at work. Hes a crazy wigger drug dealer. He sucks. I had to train him too. Blah. Luch was busy and I was soposed to be on fry till Harvey came down and I got the shaft to dishes cuz fuck face bill didn't have a ride to work.

Yestarday was cool cuz I got to see Kasey. All we did was chill in my car.. and I couldn't have been happier. I really can't wair untill I can see her again (which won't be untill sometime next week cuz of my damn job.) Man I really worried. My job ruled one really important relationship in my life and I really don't want it to rule another. ::Sigh:: I dunno, when I'm with her I feel free, like i have no job, no responsibilites.

Things really couldn't be better between us. Honestly. Its weird tho. (And I'm not kocking my realtionship with kasey by any means) but I just thought of something.

The only redeeming factor in this whole sick equation of me working late even tho I don't have to is the fact that its gonna look good, and everybody is gonna see it. I can say I played a part in it. So thats cool. God. Fuckin Mark stayed  and helped tonight. That was reallllllllllllllllllllll fun. Iv never seen anyone as proud of a spackel job as him. It wasen't even that good. I had to go and touch it up after he left. Then more primer, sand, spackel, sand, prime again. So tedious. I also have to stay late tommarow and do the other half of the resturant. Great. Well I get friday off and I'm hangin with Kasey so thats pretty much the only thing keeping me motivated right now. 

So I finally made my peace with Farrell. Thats good. I was really awkward talking to her, even online. But we said things that needed to be said and I guess all is well. Its gonna be awhile before we could ever even think about being friends again, but whatever. I do have to say, closure is nice, even after 5 months.

However I don't think that I have ever been happier to hear the someones wife left them and took the kids. I know is wrong and bad to think that, but I don't think anyone should have to put up with him, much less be related to him. Hes just an angry, angry mexican. Luch was pretty busy so that made me forget that he was alive so that was good. I left at 2. Went back at 5. Dinner was slow so I pretty much did all my work for the morning to keep busy. After that Harvey asked me to stay and help him put primer on the walls so that they can be papered. What a nightmare. I mean it took a lot less time then I thought but working with Harvey isn't the most entertaning thing to do. I think that man could make a tree die of bordom. Gah. Well it will show up in next weeks check.

I really can't wait till friday. I'm gonna chill with Kasey and its gonna be awsome. I really wish there was more to do in this damn town. Cuz just driving around is getting really old really fast. I dunno all I thought about today was Kasey. I know I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.... but I dunno its just this feeling that I get when I'm with her. I personally think shes irresistable. Its like I forget about all the bad in my life when I'm with her. For once I'm not worry about 80 different things all the time. Its almost surreal. 

I should prolly be gettin the bed soon. Work tommarow at 10. w00t."

"event","I'm gonna rant about my job again. Well today I come in at 11 to clean the front. Lo and behold my boss is the only there. I go up to the door. Locked. What the fuck!? So I sit in my car and wait for him to come out and have a cigarette. An hour passes by, I'v been going up and knocking perioticly, nothing. Then John cruses in and hes late. So I only have an hour to do 2 hours worth of work. Then, here come the best part, they wonder why I'm not done in time for the place to open. Fuck faces. Its about 1:30 by then, I don't have to be on till 2 so I go home and try and relax. 1:45 I get a call from John asking me to pick up Ted and bring him to Alteri's. GODAMMIT Ted dosen't even work there anymore. What the fuck. So me being the nice guy that I am, I picked him up. He wants to go to James' house to see if his sister found the title to her car so he can get it on the road. Im soposed to be at work then. He gets all pissy so I drive him to James' house and no one answeres the door. I go to work then. From then on its all downhill. I had to work with that peice of shit mexican Mark so that puts me in a bad mood by default. The night passes by slowly of course, and its busy. Mark takes of earley as usual and I'm stuck bailing out the worst dishboy in the history of all creation. I get out at 10 and I go home and well here I am."

I get depressed as soon as I walk in the door. Its prolly all the bullshit that I put up with when I'm there. Like having to deal with the peice of shit Mark and his wanting to switch days with me all the time. I'm done with that. It's not my fault Harvey scheduals him for the wrong fucking days, I have a life too. James was all pissed off today at the shitty dish machine and its not getting dishes clean. I have to admit that the machine sucks but he didn't have to go postal. That just makes for a very stressful working environment. ::sigh:: I was there from 10 in the morning till 9 tonight and im just fucking drained. 

Well I get tommarow off so thats good. And I get to see Kasey. Man, shes the greatest. Wow I'm starting to sound like her now. Not that its a bad thing.  Well I should prolly go to bed before I pass out."

"event","SO I'v come to the conclusion that my life is boring. I mean I work all the time, when I mean all the time i mean 6 days a week. I don't really ever get a chance to see people outside of work except for Val and Kasey, which is cool. Its such a weight off of my should when I chill with one of them cuz their not bantering me to cook food faster or telling me that my cooking sucks (Mark). I really can't wait to go back to school so I can have some more human interaction (I don't consider anyone that works at alteri's to be human). ::Sigh:: Just thinking about when I won't have to work full time and not be the bitch there anymore. 

I also can't rememeber when i'v ahd a full, refreshing sleep. Latley iv been going to be at 1 or 2 in the morning. As soon as my head hits the pillow I start to worry. Just about everything, but mostly a lot of little things. Things not worth getting into. 

Well im off.."

I worked more hours then my parents this week, thats really sad. But I did walk away with $400. bling bling. So I finally went to the E.R. about my ear. It was really infected and what they did was the most painful experience in my life. They cut my ear open and pressed really really hard on it.

I chilled with Kasey, Moira, and Wendy yestarday. That was really fun. We went to Wal-Mart then p-chop. Personally i fail to see what Kasey sees in me. I mean, im no prize, I don't really consider myself anything special. Shes great tho. Its like that movie says, shes some kinds of wonderful."

"event","Wow. Its been awhile since Iv done this. Jeez since October. Well you can thank Val for the numerous E-mails he sent me about updating my journal. hehe. Well a real lot has happened since I wrote last. This might take awhile.

Well I'll start from the begining. After my first semester at the valley was over all was well and good. I had Lea, my job was going good, typing this now makes me feel like I had everything those few months ago. Well I got a letter awhile back from Hudson Valley saying that I was on academic probation and that I wasn't eligable for financial aid anymore. Fuck. This is because I had to take some time out from school to help take care of my grandmother so I ended up getting an F in UNIX, an incomplete in econ, and an absent without withdrawell in fundementals. So I read the letter and on the bottom there was this thing saying that if I had some extenuating circumstances that I may be able to get the academic probation waved for the next semester. So I go to the counciling office and fill out the paper work and pour my heart out in the letter that they made me write. I call a few days later and they say that my waver had been denied. FUCK. So I can't go back untill I earn enough money by working full-time at the big A. So that was pretty shitty.

What makes it worse is that on the very same day that I found out that I can't go back to school Lea (Who Iv been taking a break from) IMs me and starts giving me shit about how the seperation is hurting our relationship. Well god knows that I never stopped caring for her when I wasn't seeing her. So anyway I just got fed up and dicided that breaking up with her would be a better course of action the sitting there fighting about it. So that put me in an even worse mood.

On top of all this other shit happening things were beginning to change at Alteri's. The owner hired a new cook with all of this experience so beef up our dishes with all of the competition going in with the new mall. In fairness to him he is an awsome guy. But everyone's hours turned into shit. So I was make like $80 a week wich isn't enough for my car payment insurance, and gas. So yeah that was shitty.

But now things are beginning to return to normal, I have my room back, My hours are returning to normal, and I have a sweet new car. My vagina mobile as stupid dave puts it. 

Thursday I'm chillin with Kasey and thats gonna kick ass cuz i haven't seen her in such a long time. Man, I miss hangin with her. 

Well thats it for now."

"event","Wow. I hate my english class. I had to write a paper on how good of a school Hudson Valley is. Don't get me wrong it is a very good school but I don't like the idea of a student being forced to write a paper on it. I was working on my old essay about how my Dad infulenced me to do better in school when the teacher saw it. ""The paper is not soposed to be about you, its about something in your life."" Then she proceeded to change my bitchin essay to some stupid bullshit about Hudson Valley. What a bitch. Altho I do have to say that a paper on Hudson Valley is really easy to bullshit. Ha. Take that you stupid whore. 

I talked to Farrell over the weekend. And now I'm more confused then ever. She said that she never lied to me about anything and that shes not going out with John. But no one seems to deny that their going out. Whatever. I'm WAY WAY WAY too happy with Lea to be worrying about stupid bullshit like that. Oh and speaking of Lea I get to pick her up after school today. I can't wait. I haven't seen her in what, 2, 3  days? Well Im still excited about seeing her. Fuck you. 

I have been talking more and more with Laura the past few weeks. It seems like were becoming great friends again. Which is good, but strange. Strange because I can talk to her about a lot of things and she can actually understand where I'm coming from. That is a very drastic change from high school. She is turning into one of those people that you can talk to and you feel that they really understand what your saying and where your coming from. It seems like she can understand me more now then ever when we were going out. Very, very strange. 

Well class in 5. Mabye I'll write soon."

Was eagerly waiting for my last mod's final results. The long wait is definitely worth it! WOOOHOOOO!

Anws, decided (again) to move my blog to http://mylifeinatlanta.blogspot.com

I know I'm v fickle but the interface there is so much more appealing."

"event","Thunderstorms are funny here. It's periodic. Sort of like intense short bursts every now and then. Unlike those back in Singapore which typically lasts for more than 30 minutes, thunderstorms here just come and go in a flash.

Though thunderstorms occur very briefly, my TV reception is wiped out. Am stuck with good old radio and an Atlanta city guide. Was suppose to head out for dinner, looks like Ray's going to get some food on his way back here. Good news is, we'll probably get the car by tomorrow, which means more mobility for the both of us! *fingers crossed*"

"event","Yesterday's cooking was disastrous filled with smoke and peppered with blood. Was heating up the pan with some oil when it got too hot and the spatula got burnt, setting off a stream of smoke then before I knew it, the smoke detector went BEEP BEEP BEEP!  you should have seen me. I was running around looking for a number to call as I didn't want fire engines come running to the apartment. Thank goodness the detector is not linked to any fire station.

The bloody part happened when I was washing the lid of a glass pot. Didn't notice a slight broken part on the inside of the lid and there you guessed it, slide my finger down and sustained a small cut. But blood kept flowing. Only stopped after 20 min. But dinner was ok (for a first attempt). We had roasted butter chicken, carrots and potatoes soup and rice cooked in microwave (which I painstakingly monitored every 5 min, adding water just in case it got too dried out). 

Going apartment hunting today. Yay! Meanwhile, here's some pics that we took in Bangkok and at the airport before we departed for Atlanta on 27 Apr.

"event","It's first day of work for Ray. Wish him good luck. Got up early to prepare breakfast for him. 

We hit the malls yesterday. Noticed we were the only ones walking, cause the rest of them seem to drive to wherever they were going. Feels so small in such a big city. Anws,  there's so many places to shop here. Think all my gfs will go crazy here. There's Nordstrom, Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Ave. On top of that there's Old Navy, Coach, Gucci, Abercrombie, etc. Man, I wish I have money!

Went to church after that. The choir was great. But nobody sang, which was a pity. Apparently the 5pm mass is a singles mass. Quite a lot of singles. Hehe. Interesting. Had dinner at this Surin's Thai Food. It was awesome. Taste a little bit like home.

Going to cook lunch and dinner today. My first attempt since a long, long time :)

"event","Still jet-lagged. Viewed some apartments today. Not bad but pricey. But these areas are great because they are near amenities with 24 hr gym, pool and a vegetable garden! Will prob look at more apartments before we decide. Learn something interesting today. Over here, townhouses and condos are owned properties while apartments refer to rental properties. Never knew this!

Pat and Sonia are such darlings. Fetched us from the airport when we arrived and have been taking us around town. We are settling in well and am really having a great time. We ought to get a car because it's really hard to get around here without one. Everything's here supersized. I can never finish an entree by myself. We share food all the time.

Did some grocery after the Liverpool/Arsenal game (not that I watch but I had to go there because I need to eat). Will prob start cooking next week!

Here's a tour of the apartment:

"event","So today's the BIG MOVE. Has been a hectic day so far. Went to the dentist to have my wound checked. Everything looks good. Hop to Chinatown to change more USD. Then walked over to Telok Ayer St to collect my PADI cert. Reached home at about 2.30pm and did some last minute tidying up of the room and packing my luggage.

My luggage is unbelievably heavy. Blame it on my stubbornness and refusal to get a third luggage. Now I've to painfully extract some stuff from my luggage which I can't bring along to Atlanta. Sob sob.

Went to JB yesterday. Had a good time with Ray's friends. Hanging out with them was like on the set of a comedy. Having dinner with family later before heading to the airport. Hope nothing drama mama's going to happen. Know my mum is worried sick about me.  Guess have to reassure her that all will be fine.

Ciao Singapore!"

"event","Wasted one whole day yesterday only to be tortured later. Had my wisdom tooth extracted SURGICALLY. Must say the whole experience was rather unnerving. Being put in the cold, cold dentist chair and the sounds of the surgical tools clanging against one another. Though I was blindfolded during the surgery, I was still pretty traumatized to a certain extent. It must be the drilling. It was horrifying. Like a Texas chainsaw massacre occurring right in my mouth.  Apparently the tooth was too stubborn. Dentist had to drilled the tooth into three parts to pull it out. Ouch!

The movers coming round to pick up the stuff today. I have a about 18 boxes of stuff to be shipped over. The day is nearing. Am feeling excited yet apprehensive at the same time."

Was pretty stress the past few days over the visa application. Thanked God everything went well :). Now the reality of moving to Atlanta has finally set in. In less than a week's time we'll both be heading to a foreign land to start a new life. Can't wait.

Decided, ""life in atlanta"" sounds better. :p

Counting the hours down to my flight for BKK. Love it there. Love the hot stone massages, foot reflexology, shopping and food, glorious food!

Legs are giving me problem again. Must be from walking too much earlier. Went Ikea and we spent only $21.20 but got loads in return! Thanks to Ray's redemption for a $100 Ikea voucher. Bought pans, pots, chopping board, ironing boards, etc for our new life in Atlanta. This is so exciting! 

Met up with Nicky earlier for hi-tea. Marriot's hi-tea is the best. It has the best dessert spread. He gave me a frame with pics from the wedding as a going-away gift. How sweet. Am packing it along with moi.

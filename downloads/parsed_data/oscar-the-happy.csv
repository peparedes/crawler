"event","So I'm back at school with the rest of my clan (cept Emmett, but well duh.)

In case anyone was wondering, Emmett's doing fine. His Quidditch scholarship has him at Ithaca, since they have a pretty good programme. He's working through it. Enjoys it even, when he thinks about it. Someone even said the ""E"" word around him and he didn;t shut off, he just sorta went a bit subdued. That's a definite improvement to the near-suicidal he was a year ago. A whole year. Shit.

Dahalia, I'm coming to find you now. Don't care how late it is, I'm coming now. I'd be surprised if you're sleeping anyway."

"event","So Christmas went with nary a hitch. Of course it was noisy, but it was home, and family, and Christmas. Ben, Tracey and Gerry woke me up at 4am, and ten minutes later, Emmett had been woken and I was dragged into his room with the others. Aaaaah the hilarity. *sceptical look* Of course, we couldn't go wake Mum and Dad til 7:30, as is the rules, but Tracey and Gerry running up and down the hallway to see if they were awake yet kinda woke them about 6:45. Stockings, then aaaaaaall morning being taunted by tree presents til after lunch, when those pile were opened, and then mid-afternoon the extended family came to ours for dinner and stayed til about 11pm.

So that was Christmas! Yay!

I suppose I'll be seeing all the growd-ups at the S&D for NYE party?

I still need to buy a new Edinborough Efreets quidditch jersey. I might use my christmas money for it."

<b>Please Remember:</b> 
-no drinking unless you're over 16. I am, so I'll be drinking. In a well-behaved, orderly fachion, of course. 
-not to break anything, because you'll have to pay for it.
-have fun! it's a party!
-try not to get smashed off your face, it's embarrassing when teachers will be floating about.
-I am guarding the mistletoe. If anyone wants any, you have to see me and I shall decide if the case is good enough to warrant mistletoe. There will also be spot prizes of random mistletoe placings around the hall.
-the train leaves at 11am tomorrow, so PLEASE don't over-sleep and miss it!

Head Boy, Over and Out!

I'm going to go get all spiffied up now, because Christmas comes but once a year, and you wanna look good for it. Dahalia, sweetums, are we going to go find Sampson beforehand and drag him along? I volunteered him to be the chaperone (and therefore, he has to be sober, ehehehe!)"

I'm doing my best to remain happy, but people are starting to get frightened and worried. We all have heard stories, I just hope none of them are as true as people would have you believe- is it true Des got bitten by a Vampire and that's why she's in hospital?

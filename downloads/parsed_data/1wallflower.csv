"event","so much has changed.  I suppose that i brought alot of it upon myself. I miss my best friend but at the same time we arent who we were. As much as i still wish we were close our interactions seem rare and akward which i hate. I really just dont know what to do or think about that. I know that you feel i betrayed you and that its something you arent going to be able to forget. Im sorry. Just remember that i would never do anything to deliberatley hurt you. I really thought i was helping, I was worried. Ive realized that you will do what you want though and I plan to stay out of it unless you voice a wanting of me to do otherwise. All of this has showed me a different side of you and I wonder how much the three of us actually knew eachother at all. I dont read either of your journals because im afraid of what they might say. i dont want to read about us not being close anymore or about you hating me so i just choose to not know whats going on. its just strange that we are both online and not talkin to eachother, that i have your dress but dont know when ill see you to give it back to you when 3 months ago the answer would be that u would already have your dress and i wouldnt be talking to you online because you would be here doing something random with me. i can accept that things change i just want you to know that i didnt ever ever want to hurt you. i know that i went about things wrong and didnt really help anything and im sorry and i understand that you cant forget that."

"event","i was thinking today and that trailer totally defined my summer and changed my life... funny how things work out. a couple of weeks there full of underwear, alcohol, and cigarettes flipped my life upside down. it formed strong friendships, gave me the label ""annorexic (sp?) crack whore, ruined relationships, stripped me of my remaining innocence, allowed me to meet a real live rock star, and taught us all a lesson in ""slumming it."" the funny part is that the owner of this trailer has no clue being that he was gone in europe for all of this. it wasnt one significant event that happened... im not really even sure what it was, only that pretty much everything is different now, im still the same person just living with very different circumstances. even tho it was mostly bad... i wouldnt take ne of it back. heres to the trailer"

random but thought provoking song lyrics of the moment

Have another drink and drive yourself home.
I hope there's ice on all the roads.
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt,
and again when your head goes through the windshield.

And I can't let you, let me down again

She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her.
Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect.
He whispers that he loves her,
but she's probably only looking for se-...

Die young and save yourself

Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

And it's all I need
But blah blah blah
Because it fell apart and

In times like these
In times like those
What will be will be
And so it goes


hmmmm

wat has the dumbass goten himself into this time"

"event","i didnt realize it would be this hard. i didnt realize i would miss him so much. and missing him makes me wonder if its because i want to be with him or just because hes all i know. it makes me wonder if i should just give in and go back. but if i do that ill regret it... i have to at least try this whole on my own thing even if its only for a couple weeks... so far ive only lasted 2 days. its so hard... hes hurting so much and he doesnt see that i am too. mikes there to temporarily dull the pain but in the end it just makes it that much harder."

"event","i had a good day... erika al and i took a road trip to Pitt (only ours was DUI free) then i went to dinner with vanessa and then we saw her puppy and then i watched the breakfast club with al and erika bc i was left out of the loop and invite for other plans. we didnt find that much we liked but it was still fun. i somehow jsut figured out kat is taking abby to the beach... i feel strange about it... not mad and just suprised but i cant be upset i wouldnt have gone neway cuz im flaky like that

i dont want al to leave so much :(

and i dont want soccer to start for erika

and i dont want robby to come home... its so much easier to jsut not deal with

and i wish i could take beautiful pictures of myself like rachyl... i dont even have to take them myself someone else could take them... ive never liked the way i looked in a single picture

and i wish i could find sunglasses that didnt make me look like an ass

and i wish i knew a better way to deal with all of this

and i wish i could explain why or understand why i did what i did

and i wish the text message i just got was from someone else who i wish was thinking about me but i kno is not

and i wish i didnt wish that

and i wish i knew what was the right decision

and i wish i knew that i didnt still need him

and i wish i could still be madly in love with him

and i wish that our unit could stay this close forever

and i wish i could make myself do something productive this summer

and i wish i could make myself care nemore about nething... but i cant

and i wish that if i left my friends would care so much that theyd make me a good bye video like als ... but they wouldnt

most of all... i wish i knew what i was running from

i dont regret nething ive done

but wat if its all wrong

wat if im digging my own grave

i need to get out of here
but theres no where left to go
no one left to run to"

"event","this week has been amazing, alot has happened so ill just hit on some highlights....

our incredibly random night which we should probably all regret but none of us do or ever will... followed by a great morning...it so nice to have people that like just driving around enjoying jack johnson and the weather just as much as i do

the fact that someone else knew who lucky boys confusion was

realizing that being asian must really rock

being lazy at the pool

buying al lunch two days in a row

granola bar in pen twirlers car

being really really pissed at him for an hour and then deciding to only be mad... its almost refreshing to deal with a guy whos not perfect and doesnt do the right thing all the time and NEVER really knows wat to say... i truly am happy to be mad at him which just ends up making me smile.. and realizing idont need to be mad but still its fun... i kno he wont put up with me much longer but thats ok

going to work on 1 1/2 of sleep

being awake when the sunrises and the birds start chirping

the fact that EVERYONE is worried about me... while it can be annoying its nice that people actually care i suppose

the HUGE picnic and huka bar

the test that was passed with flying colors

I <3 u guys even those who i never seem to see nemore and i <3 this summer

ps... its not that i dont ever write its that all of my entries are locked so stop askin me 

pps... im fine... im not doing coke and im not anorexic and im not sleeping with him"

"event","STEFAN!!  How freakin cute is he?  We've talked everyday I've been home since I left Germany.  He went to a party tonignt so you know that that means: bedrunken!  It's not that I like talking to drunk people, he's just really funny when he's drunk.  By the looks of things, I will be going to Germany.  I'm not sure when or how I'm going to make it work, but it will happen.  It sucks that he's all the way over there, but I like it because it gives me freedom to meet who I want, but still have him as my main guy.  

I've backed away from a lot of guys this summer.  Jason seems to be the only one I talk to, and that's a once a week activity.  I stopped by Mo and Jumangi's stores on my way to rehersals.  Mo is still beautiful and Ju is still horny...what's new?  He asked me to hang out with him one day since he was off all week and that made me happy.  I wasn't sure how he felt after we hooked up so now I know he's ok.  Mo isn't as obsessed with me so that's good.  I really just want to be friends with him, but thoes baby-ass lips of his keep killin me!  Jason on the other hand is my baby.  We don't agree on anyhing but the fact that we are going to be friends for a long time.  We balance eachother out and are one the same level in terms of thought.  He's doin his thing and I'm going mine, we don't bother eachother and talk when we can.  He's going back on tour so I may not see him untill the winter.  He's gotta pimp his hoes.

Kinda sick.  I want to hit up Harlem Week with Shel this weekend, Nick tells me it's a lot of fun.  I'm still broke but sexy so it's not so bad.  Ahh can't think..

So you had a tutti concert yesterday.  One word: Chris ::creams::  I have a new approach to liking him: fuck it!  The whole CC knows I have claimed him and I made it pretty obvious to his friends that I'm in love, so why pretend I'm not?  Every chance I got I was in the YM room actin like a fool.  I hung out with Saundra, Shiita, Virginia, Ivana, and Rushain the whole time, and it came to a point where they were pulling me away from 781 while I sang ""You Are So Beautiful"" at the top of my lungs.  He's so poise and captivating, you can't help but be astonished.  His face is nothing shy of perfection and his complection matches mine perfectly.  We didn't talk that much at all.  Alex and I attacked him but somehow we got split up.  I wasn't leaving untill I said bye to him and he knew that too.  I was walking away and heard him call my name.  With his arms spread he prepared my hug a few yards too early and gave me a wery simple, homosexual peck on the cheek before a record 3.75 second hug (yes!).  

I kno he's gay, damnit!

Why do people think I'm that dumb?  I just refuse to let it process at the moment.  Jamarkie and him will have to be haviing hot manly sex on a bed of tulips in Bremen, Germany for me to see the truth.   Untill then, I love you, Chris..."

Mo is soooo sexy!!  OMG he looks like a Senagalese Murphy Lee.  His store isn't far from the Y so I walked over to his job to see him the other day.  He looked sooo good omg.  We complement eachother physicly.  He's a couple inches taller than me with pretty chocolate skin and short locs.  The second thing he said to me was, ""I like your shoes,"" and by then I knew he was a keeper, expecially when i looked down at his and saw my Puma Sprints on his feet ::tingles::  Words couldn't describe how I felt at that point.  We walked about 20 blocks and talked about everything.  It felt so good to be in someones arms and to have a beautiful face tell me how beautiful I am.  It makes me really happy being with him, but I know it's just the feeling that I want.  I'm gonna play this by ear and see how things work..if they work at all."

Who knows if I'll ever have another french test in my life?!  We have the best time in that class talking about drugs and sex and kangaroos and all topics other that France.  I'm gonna miss that little man..

Mo is crazy.  He's been thinking about me since I met him like last summer and said that he needs me.  No one needs me!  He did say that he understands that I'm a beautiful girl and he's sure that I have a boyfriend, and since he's so accepting of the other people in my phone book, he can stay.  

Jumangi's still on my mind.  I'm sure right now he's in his new apartment diggin' out his ""friend"" from England and not waisting 2 seconds of thought on me--I love that.  The fact that he dosen't care about me at all it what makes me so interested in him, aswell as Chris and Jay.  All three of them have lives that in no way involve me.  The challenge is what erouses me.  Slowly working my way up to a place of importance gives me something fun to do, and the end result, once they see how great I am, is amazing.  Jumangi dosen't know what he's gotton himself into..

"event","Great day!  I had a concert at WNYC in the morning so I ditched school and headed over to the city.  Had an AMAZING performance.  I was upset I didn't tell too many people about it.  I had 2 hours to kill by the time the performance was over and I refused to spend it alone.  It was a beautiful day and I was looking pretty good, why not visit an old friend: Jumangi.  I flip-flopped over to The Shoe Closet and was detoured to his new spot.  After 10 mins of ""So, how ya been?""s, we actually sat down and talked.  We talked about everything from my views on interracial relationships to his views on virginity.  His presence is so comforting, half the time I would just look at him.  He gave me the attention I needed, but he was still at work, so every time a customer would come in he would whisper, ""Don't go anywhere,"" and do his job.  He's so tall and lean and dresses so well, I couldn't help but look at him.  He's sexy in his own odd manner.  He becomes mature and upfront abruptly, but most of the time he's very care-free.  He fascinates me.  He's interested in me but he also has a life.  He's not like Mo who wants to wife me, but he gives me enough attention to stay around.  There is so much about him that I need to know, and no matter what happens, I'll find it out sooner or later.

So that was the highlight of the day.  With Jumangi back in the picture and Mo calling me from the blue, I currently have (in no particular order) Cyril, Mo, Jumangi, Jason, Jay, and Dwayne as friends.  Soon, one of them is bound to have their metamorphosis into my love bug.."

He's in this grey area where he's not young enough to understand my restrictions as a sophomore, but not old enough for me to explain them to him without looking like a dumb little kid.  I like Cyril a lot, but late at night while he's tired, or mid afternoon when he's high.  I till don't know enough about him to know what I want him to be in my life, but so far things aren't too promising.  He's a great person and sooo funny, but he's into a lot of stuff I don't want to get itno right now.  I slipped up and told him about my ""talent"".  Part of me wants to just 'cause I haven't done it in so long but that's my only motivation, and for now, it's not enough to get me down there.  With my current *ahem* <b>state</b>, who knows what I might do with him..

"event","""I'm a winner because I ACT-SO,"" literally!  Lets start from the beginning..

So I get to the school and there are half the amount of people that were there yesterday.  I found Alfreado and a few of his friends so I wouldn't look so lonely, and eyed the room.  The only people there of any importance were the painter with the pretty 'fro and Marcus's friend.  I sat by 'fro boy and all the other people in my branch, and as time went by, my confidence dwindled.  By the time they got to vocal classical I was hardly breathing.  When they called my name for bronze I was just relieved that I would be able to show my face outside of this auditorium (sorry, but I'm too above average to be bare-necked with all the average people..)  By the time they got to vocal contemporary, my mind was everywhere else but on the name announcements.  When they said that the silver metal went to Seshat Young, I was baffled.  I felt out of place on that stage, but overjoyed about the win.  I later found out that Ameecer win bronze in dance, Marcus's friend won gold in instrumental classical, even Marcus, who was absent from the event, won a silver medal.  I called him to congratulate him..I'm still waiting for a response to my message.  Whatever, I'm too happy to care about him right now.  I now know that I don't need to chorus to succeed, I don't do too bad on my own!"

"event","Well, as I said, I got what I deserved.  I didn't do badly, just not as well as I would've liked.  Classical seems to be in the bag: there were only 4 people in that category.  I did well in contemporary, but so did everyone else so I'm not expecting anything.  Enough of that, now the good stuff..

Chi Chi was there too so I knew we were gonna have fun.  The guy turn out wasn't anything special, but there were a few nice ones.  The best thing about ACT-SO is that A. 99% of the guys there will be black, and B. they're in high school.  With that in mind, I didn't hold back from eyeing anyone down.  I wore a pink and blue blouse and black pants, with my ballet flats and a ribbon around my waist.  My hair was fresh and my skin was nice and there was no question that I was lookin' good!  Towards the beginning of the program I spotted my prey.  I didn't have much time to act before I had to go sing, and my nerves dissolved all feelings of lust and I was too focused to care about anyone besides myself.  By the time Cheech and I were done, he was too.  We wandered around the hallway eyeing him down as we passed.  It got to a point where I was less than a foot away from this 6'1, nappy-headed, cute-as-he-wanna-be saxophonist.  He wore all black, and had no color visible but his creamy brown skin and his various red, black, and green wrist bands.  With a half hour of stalking Chi Chi finally pulled him to the side and let him know the deal.  When I shook his hand and saw is silver Ankh ring, I thought fast and decided to give him the government: Seshat!  Bad move..his name is Mark.  He's a sweetheart.  I don't think we're looking at one another for a potential partner with him going off to Harvard or Yale in the fall, but we have enough in common to keep in touch.  Not too excited, just glad to have a normal guy in my phone book!"

We went from the Gap to Express, to stealing band-aids to eating mexican, to walkin through the getto to picking up Zara, all the way to chorus.  We joked about James lady-like ways while I fell in love with his sunglasses (I need a pair, they're crazy!)  How cute is James?!  He adores Alex.  It's cute in one way, and upsetting in another.  Puppys are cute when they're new..but then they grow up, rip ur funrniture, pee on the carpet, and then are all over you when you get home from a long day..damn puppies!  Wow sry about that, had a flashback (lol Alex).  Anyway, ACT-SO tomorrow!!!

"event","Pretty good day.  Hung around the house singing and eventually frustrating myself.  Went to New York and got together with Alex.  I should've known there was no way I was gonna get to rehersal on time..  We did pretty well, doing a bit of window shopping along the way, but then, we passed Express.  The denim jackets and cotton blends got the best of us, and the next thing I knew, Alex had a dozen button-down polos in his dressing room and im throwing logo tees over the door!  *Alex looks AMAZING in blue and green.  They don't <b>just</b> bring out his eyes, I sware he turns into a walking aphrodisiac!*  Though I enjoyed being with Alex there was a real reason why I wanted to stay in the store so long: a 5'11 mocah-skinned beauty with a head full of curls and a stunning smile.  He was a prime example of exotic perfection, and I promise you, that will not be our last encounter, Mystery Man!

So that was the highlight of my day.  James met up with us breifly and I got to chorus at about 5 and went home.  Jason is getting less important by the hour.  He's getting way too comfortable and thinks he has me..someone need to let him kno!

I've been so cockey these past few weeks, but time has humbled me down.  Last year I came home to two bronzes, this year I'm shooting for at least one silver.  lol yes silver!  The finals are the same time as Germany so as long as I don't qualify to go then there's no hard feelings about missing finals.  What I'm really excited about is the multitude of masculinity in the house.   I'm not planning on meeting anyone, but I will make a point of making myself seen.  I go last at all the preformences, and that leaves plenty of time to ""get lost""..

I saw Ms. Karen today!!!  I was watching a modeling show on E yesterday and almost caller her in the middle of it to let her know how bad I want my porfolio done.  I was getting off the train and could feel her mighty presence.  She's so amazing!  Comming down the stairs in her Gucci pumps with a scarf wrapped around her hair to insure her million dollar hair cut stayed in tact.  She has the most interesting kind of slyle:  glamorous..without much glam.  She wears no makeup or jewelery and still looks beautiful each and every time I see her.  She told me she got a studio (finally!) and is gonna shoot me and soome other chick.  Getting together with her will be a great after-TG gift to myself.

For the 4 or 5 months we've been talking he's only brought up sex once, has never gotten mad at me about canceling one of our outings, and never tried to move our ""relationship"" too fast.  He dosen't O.D. on phone calls and when I don't pick up, I'm always excited to hear the sweet message waiting for me.  He's a true island boy, chill and relaxed untill he gets mad, and to top it all off, he has really nice shoes!  Still, he's not enough to be all that important.  Jay makes the <b>perfect</b> guy friend, why is it that I seem to be the only one who sees that?  The only reason why today I thought otherwise is because he's starting to remind me of Red..

I miss Red so much. He is one of the only people in my life that I've lost for good.  Great looking, great dresser, great job, house, smile..and it's all gone.  Everything happened so fast that it's just now sinking in what a good man I had.  A 6'2 Donnel Jones twin all to myself, and in an instant, he's gone.  

For now, I don't know what I'm gonna do.  Alex and Baset are the only two me in my life, and I think I'm gonna keep it that way!

"event","Pretty good day.  Got my class list in (finally) and there will be no more gym for Shay next year!  Yay!  Like 45% of my science class has been stabbed or slashed, and It made me feel left out.  I decided to reminiss on a time when I was put in a similar siuation..

""I was 6, and one of the best color-in-the-liners in my class.  One day, as I was coloring, I took a girls crayons by accident.  The became enraged and went into the arts and crafts box in search of the  ::scary music plays:: <b>saftey scissors</b>!  I didn't know what to do.  Should I play chicken and call Mrs. Inamer, or stick it out and take this situation like a man?  Things didn't work out as well as I had thought, because the next thing I knew, I had cold, red plastic sliding down the right side of my face.  I had a cut from my hair line, through my eye lid, and down to my chin.  I toutched my rather bloodless face and was saddened to find that there was no significant wound, but the white scratch line would do.  I displayed my buck 25 with pride..untill Mrs. Inamer got a look at me.  Before I knew it, she had a wet tissue slide across my face, erasing my hard-earned scratch..damn you Mrs. Inamer!""

Went to rehersal.  Not too much excitement.  I'm seeing Mo on Wednesday.  I'm not excited, but I think this get together will open lots of doors.  He ""just wants to make [me] happy"" and there are many ways to do that.  The last thing I want is to be labled as a gold-digger, nor do I want to be with Mo, so I'm just ride this out and see how things work out.."

"event","Church was bangin.  PD was talkin' about lust and stuff, and how couples might not be having sex, but the guy will be like, ""Lemme hug her so I could feel her breasts rub up on my cheast.""  Being a virgin is one of the few things that keep me happy about being a ""singular noun"" for the time being.  I have nothing to miss.  The little bit I did while I had a boyfriend is so insignificant.  I'm takin this whole sex thing one day at a time.  I could fall in love tomorrow and compleetly change my mind, but for now, Shay's gonna keep her long legs closed (and her pretty lips too..lmao I couldn't hold that one in!)

Umm yea, SCY sucks.  We have been so boring lately!  I love being ova Yvette house, but I'm either sleeping, or debating on if I should walk over to Cyril's house and chill wit him.  I gotta go shopping for Yvette's dinner party..my girl's bout to be 16 lol finally!!

I now know what I wanna be when I grow up: a fashion journalist.  It's the best of both worlds!  I get to write, something that I love to do just as much as sing, aswell as get a seat at all the hottest fashion shows.  Since the whole modeling thing isn't gonna work out, at least I can still be one of the beautiful people.  I can live in my loft apartment in New York with my profesional coreographer roomate/best friend, Eve.  Hmm let me not let my imagination carry me away like it always does.  I'm a junior fashionista with a fresh look and a keen eye, with a degree in journalism and a full Hooked on Phonics course under my belt, I'll be ready for the job.  When I was 15 I wanted to be a voice teacher, when I was 13 I wanted to be a model, when I was 9 I wanted to be a pediatrician, and when I was 4 a wanted to be a spider..lets see how long this dream lasts."

"event","So I went over there after all.  SCY was unusually boring today.  We watched the game all day which gave little opportunity to pause anyone..how sexual can basketball really get?  Bash came over around 10 and by then I knew I had to go.  He is sooo strange!  He participates in conversations with people who are participating in conversations other than the ones he initiated..He makes the most random comments and will milk the topic till it's dry..or 'till someone tells him to shut up.  Overall, he's a great guy..when he's not talking."

"event","Well, it's saturday, and I should be at the SCY meeting.  Part of me wants to go over to Yvette's house but I don't know.  I'm sure Calib is over there, and I feel funny about  the fact thet she dosen't invite me over anymore, despite the fact that I begin SCY!  lol I dunno, it's not a big deal but I told them that if I don't have a man in 2 weeks then I'm not hangin out with <b>ANY</b> happy couples till I'm a part of one!"

"event","I've got my first hater!  Ina glares at me <b>all</b> rehersal, <b>every</b> rehersal!  I mean I understand I am a stunning young lady but even the most beautiful person gets old after you see them 3 days a week for 2 months!  Shana has adopted this stank attitude and it's 2 second from bein spoken on.  It's fine if we not tight anyomore, but do you know how much time I spent on the phone with this girl cause she needed someone to listen to her?  She hasn't gottan too disrespectful yet but as long as she keep her mouth shut then I'm fine.  Besides thoes two, I'm ok with everyone else.  I've been busting my ass these past 2 months and I want to make sure everyone sees my growth.  I mak not be the best musician in there, but I'm improving at a much faster speed then any other second-year chorister.  I've learned to shut my mouth and worry about the beautiful sounds coming out of <b>my</b> mouth, but I'm not gonna bite my toung if something needs to be said, either..

Besides rehersal today was a pretty good day!  I had my voice lessons with Kim and we spent half of it talking about Westminister the culture shock she got from going from Brooklyn to Prinston..I'm still not sure if I wanna go there but I'll apply I guess.  Jay asked me to get back with him for the 5th time this month!  This time, I almost said yes!  Think about it:  I haven't been in love since him, so why not just start over with an old flame then having to build up trust and love for some stranger?  My ultimate goal is to be happy and I don't know if he can make me happy right now.  He takes up so much energy, with is constant mood swings, you have to be on the phone with him for 5 hours just to keep him from shooting his mom!  He's down wit a lot of illegal stuff that I don't mess with and I'm not in the mood for being a Mob Boss's wife.."

"event","Today wasn't so bad.  Yvette and India are mad at eachother again so I don't hang with Toi while Eve is around in fear of being attacked.  Took the AP English exam today and ripped it!  The strangest thing happened when I got to the city.  I was headed up the stairs to catch the 2 when I look up and see this strikingly beautiful (and oddly familliar) face.  When it smiles back at me I remember who it is.  I met this guy a few months back on 42nd street and lemme tell you, this guy is too bangin!!  He satasfies my immigrant fetish ::chills:: and moved here from Nigeria about a year or 2 ago.  With his dark chocolate skin and pretty baby-locs, he may be lasting a bit longer than all the others..!"

"event","I am celebrating my daughter's 20th birthday...without her. She is with the man she loves in Blacksburg. But that's okay. I can't do much anyway so I am glad she is having a good time where she is. Now if she can get thru the weekend without a bastage creeping her out...and you know who you are...that would be great. Carly is leaving her teenager years and welcoming her adult years. She can no longer blame her faux pas on being a teenager. She will have to wait for her mid-life crisis to use her age as an excuse. (wait till you turn 32 and reach your sexual peak!!!) I love Carly dearly and have since the day she was born at 12 noon. I was in the cafeteria of the hospital when I got the call she was born. The first sight of her was her butt getting wiped and diapered! Then I saw the hair. She looked like and eskimo with a fur lined edge. She had the nose to match the eskimo look. I cried I was so happy. Her biological dad, Rob, came and cried beside me and told me to take good care of her. I think I have kept my part of the bargain. Carly has turned out to be a stunning person. Clumsy but stunning. I treasure her abilities to create beautiful songs. She is a magnificent writer. She has a brilliant imagination. And she still dreams. She hasn't been totally jaded by life. I love you, Carly. Happy birthday with many more to come. Mimi."

"event","I AM GETTING TO THE POINT THAT I REALIZE THAT GETTING HURT AT WORK IS WORSE THAN GETTING HURT IN GENERAL. I HAVE TO DEAL WITH INSURANCE PEOPLE AS WELL AS A LAWYER AND A CASE WORKER AND DOCTORS i DON'T CHOOSE ON MY OWN. I HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE WHO JUST SEE ME AS A NUMBER ON A FILE INSTEAD OF THE PERSON.I AM SUFFERING BECAUSE THE INSURANCE ASSHOLES DON'T KNOW OR SEE ME. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED MONEY SINCE AUGUST...I GOT HURT IN JULY. I CAN'T WORK SO I HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE ON EXCEPT WHAT THE SALVATION ARMY GIVES ME ONCE A MONTH. I WAS BLESSED YESTERDAY WITH A CHECK THAT ALLOWED ME TO GET THE RENT PAYED...ALTHOUGH IT WAS LATE AND I HAD TO PAY A FIFTY DOLLAR LATE FEE. I HURT ALL THE TIME AND AM DEPRESSED. I NEED ANTIDEPRESSANTS BUT CAN'T AFFORD THEM EVEN WITH INSURANCE. I AM DEPRESSED BECAUSE OF MY SITUATION. NOW MY LAWYER,DOCTORS, AND INSURANCE COMPANY ARE TRYING TO DECIDE IF THE MEDICINE SHOULD BE COVERED BY WORKMAN'S COMP. HELLO!!!! IT'S A NEVER ENDING BATTLE TO GET BETTER. I WANT TO GO BACK TO WORK BEFORE THEY GIVE MY JOB AWAY. I HATE FEELING ABANDONED AND USELESS. NOW I AM LOOKING AT SURGERY. MORE TIME OUT AND ISOLATION. I GUESS IT COULD BE WORSE...I COULD HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING. I SHOULD COUNT MY BLESSINGS THERE. I AM BLESSED THAT MY DAUGHTER CAN WORK EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T GIVE HER MANY HOURS. HER CONTRIBUTIONS DO BUY MILK AND HOT-DOGS. SHE CONTRIBUTES A LOT EMOTIONALLY...WHEN I CAN GET HER AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER...OR MINIONS."

"event","I have been a mom since 1979. My son was taken from me in an accident in 1982. I was unable to have any more kids and was near insanity. My little sister gave birth to a little girl FOR me in 1986. This little girl is Carly. Carly has always stood out amongst a crowd. I always knew she was special in so many ways...and not SPECIAL ED. Ask any neighbor from any neighborhood we lived in what they remember most about Carly and the answer would be ""her singing in the yard with such a beautiful voice."" Carly has always loved to go outside and sing to the heavens. And she has such a unique and beautiful voice. She sings songs from movies, radio and ones she makes up at the moment of her mood. Now Carly is about to turn 20 and feels like a failure for not having ""done anything with her life."" Little does she realize she has soothed many people with her singing. Made strangers smile. Carly has given of herself without realizing it as greatness. I was injured in 2002 and my back is in constant pain. I am very limited in what I can do. Then to make things worse, I was hurt in the line of duty causing injury to my knee. Now I can add painful walking to my list of ailments. Because of not being able to work a standard 40 hour work week again, money always fell short. I had to rely on the Salvation Army for food regularly as well as Christmas and Thanksgiving. Carly should have gone to college after graduating high school. Instead she took a job as a courtesy clerk in a local grocery store to help support us. She and I have always been close but this act of unselfishness amazed me. She put her dreams and wants on the back burner to help me. She could have gone and begun her life on her own.lately things have not gone well for us and her hours have been cut back to sometimes 5 hours aweek. She sees me in great pain and this has made her depressed. She sees her friends driving their own cars while we don't have one to go anywhere. She sees this as her failure. She wants to make me well again. She wants to go places and do things but there is no money. Carly has done without so much. She cried to me last night because she couldn't make everything perfect. I try to tell her that isn't her job. I am hurt and in pain for a reason and it isn't for her to fix. She has no idea, I suppose , just how much she has done for me...for us. I love hearing her in the bathroom singing as she fixes her hair. Or when she is outside sitting on the front steps singing tunes from SHREK and BEAUTY & THE BEAST. These things help soothe my pain. They help me smile and forget the overdue bills piling up. She helps me forget my pain of losing my son so tragically. Carly has done something with her life. She has done more than a lot of her friends from school. She has cared. She has cared deeply and soulfully. And I love her more and more every day for it."

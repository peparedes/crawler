"event","For valentines day, Anthony took me to this amazing seafood restaurant for dinner and drinks. As a part of my present he suprised me with a trip to Orlando Florida. We leave eearlly Wednesday morning and we're staying for a week. His grandparents love there and we can get free passes to all the parks. And we're going to Disney world too I've never been there so I'm really excited. I was in total shock when I found out. I'm nervous for the plane ride. I haven't been on a plane since 7th grade 

I just had to restore my whole entire iphone the other day which I was not happy about. While trying to update the software, something screwed up and I had to go to the iphone store and they had to restore it in order to fix it. Everything was erased from it... Pictures, ALL my music, my apps. I just got finished downloading and putting back all the music that was lost. Such a pain in the ass.

My cat suddenly got real sick. We took him to the vet today and he has two really infected and very loose teeth that need to come out. He's going in for surgery and a cleaning tomorrow morning. Puts a damper on my Florida trip but I know he's in good hands. I'm just gonna be really worried about him. He's never had surgery before and he's gonna be so scared and I feel horrible but it has to be done. The whole front of his little chest is shaved because they had to take blood I feel so bad for him."

It's only on Mondays for 4 hours starting January 24th til sometime in the beginning of May... I can't remember exactly when but I can't wait. 
I've put in SO many applications all over the place and still haven't gotten any more call backs. Hopefully when I finish school they'll be able to help me find a job at a hospital. 
Other than that, nothing much has been going on. My birthday was on the 2nd and Jaime and I got our hair done and went to dave and busters with Anthony, my brother and his friend. We drank yummy drinks an played shooting games all night it was fun.
This Friday I'm going to the bar for a little with Erin then meeting Jenni and the Tyler's for some drinking/cranium fun."

i have no clue what's up for this weekend. i have no money for the bar but that's what anthony is for hahaha. it should probably just be a weekend of drinking and playing drinking games at someone's house i'm not sure. cause i literally have 8 dollars in my bank account and i thought i had more. i fucking suck..wait its not me that sucks its not having a job that blows.

lol i was watching 'the dallas cowboys cheerleaders' its pretty self explanatory but yeah. it really made me motivated to work out and lose my fat fucking stomach. i need to get my fat ass into shape for the summer and i'm dead serious. i'd kill to be 115-120 again. i started stretching and doing crunches tonight and now i'm sore. shows just how out of shape my body is. if i even walk too fast i get all out of breath it's kind of embarassing."

"event","we were originally sposed to go to chickies and petes but i figured since there was a flyers game itd be WAY too crowded in there. so we decided to go to barnabys in havertown. i had a blast and got really drunk. some girl threw up in the bathroom right after me and michelle left thank god. sick. she was so wasted and couldnt even talk it was hilarious. i had on my 21 tiara and her friend came up to me all drunk and was like omg its your birthday too? and hugged me and im like uh ok yeah. the restuarant area closed so we sat at the bar and all these nasty drunk men kept staring at me and michelle and some man bought us drinks and on the way back to the table i almost dropped my appletini. i probably would have killed myself if i did that. i dont even remember leaving the place or the ride home haha. we got back to anthonys and i made another drink but dumped it out and idk why. i had a blast though and i miss my birthday =( all i wanna do now is go to bars and get fucked up but i cant. this is just going to give me more motivation to get my ass a job"

i'm happy with utopia, it's just they never give me the blonde i want. and they always tell me the pictures i bring in of girls' hair is just extensions. yeah well i know that but i want my hair to be DYED that color and that way. i just wanna go somewhere where i'm gonna get what i want and not what the stylists have in THEIR mind. tons of redheads dye their hair blonde, so i don't know what the problem is"

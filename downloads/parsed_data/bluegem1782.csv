"event","I was sooo happy yesterday .. not only did I make it to my appointments, run my errands, and was able to juggle a bunch of problems but I was also able to vote in under 45 minutes. I am not one to actually cast a vote but I definitely did yesterday. 

When we received the projected winner of this election I cried tears of joy and undeniable relief. Our country united and chose the person they thought was qualified and able to run this country. He may not have had all of the qualifications that both parties were looking for in the next president but he can definitely pick those that do have it and pick their brains to help the cause. I am sorry to those that are disappointed in the election yesterday but this is how it is as McCain said in his speech last night. 

I am sooo tired. Our neighbors partied really hard and had the music up so loud that my ears were still ringing at four this morning. Hopefully sleep will come fast and hard tonight now that the remaining tingles from the election are fading.

""Yes we can"" is something I will never forget."

"event","Little J had his four month check up on Wednesday and this little bugger is now 14lbs 1.5 ounces. I couldn't believe it. I mean he has gotten big and is heavy but wow what a jump. He skipped 3 month clothes all together and is now in 6-9 months but is still really cute. I will hopefully have new pictures sometime next week. Things have been really really busy on this end. In fact I might get the first chance in like two weeks to pick up a book tonight. YAY!!!!

Got a semi promotion at work so I am starting to think maybe this is going to work out after all. I am coming up on a year here in Jan. Working with hubby can sometimes be frustrating but otherwise highly rewarding in other ways.

My congratulations go out to N and M for tying the knot on Oct. 19. We all are really happy for you both and wish you both the best.

Also hubby and I celebrated our second year of marriage on the 7th. YAY!!!!

Things are overall looking in the positive for right now. I will keep thinking that. 

Politics go .... we are definitely voting and our families are very much behind Barack Obama. He stands for so much more than just a half black man on a stage with a microphone. I wish people would look past the color and see where he actually comes from and the choices he has made to get where he is now. They make a difference and have a much better list of credentials. For goodness sakes look at Palin and that should explain the ""Der de der"" right there. I would rather vote for someone that has a clean record than someone that is fighting with every person in their office on correct policy of ethics..... oh yeah ... that's right she was found guilty of improper conduct by the ethics committee for firing ... what for it... her ex-brother in law. How petty.... I will stop right there. I don't want to anger anyone. Just a few points that should be brought up before we go vote in what three days? Four? Oh yeah and people in VA please remember that voting day IS the 4th and do not pay attention to the republican committee's ads of voting being moved to the 5th. 

As anyone can tell I have been getting involved with politics this year like I think most people that normally can't stomach it has. I know I have and I originally couldn't even look at an ad without wanting to vomit, or choke someones eyeballs out. 

On a good note I do wish everyone a Happy Halloween or Samhain ... whatever your preference might be or if you are one of those odd people that don't celebrate at all.... please at least come up with a smile today. I still do believe that smiles make the world go round.

:)

Hugs to all that want one."

"event","We took Little J to his specialist yesterday and the end result was that he would possibly grow out of this colic and baby GERD (baby acid reflux disease). We still have to take him for an upper GI just in case but he thinks with stronger antacids that he will be all right. He is now almost 12 pounds. I feel a little bit better but I don't think I will be all right until the tummy pain goes away. It really bothers me when he is in pain. When he is not in pain, he is now babbling in baby language and smiling a lot. Too cute.

Rennie give pats to Merilynn (I think I spelled this wrong) for me.

Happy B-day Rob.

It has been a while. Finally got a moment. This weekend having been feeling icky. We have had so many appointments with the doctors recently it has been ridiculous. Little J is getting better but is still having a really hard time with his stomach. We have an appointment with a GI specialist with Children's Hospital soon. Here is a link to a recent picture (last weekend).

"event","I have definitely lost all concept of time. There has been times of relaxation then times of just being surrounded with baby stuff plus the changing of diapers. Fun fun .... let me tell you. All in all it is going pretty well. We had our first really rough night and we think it was due to gas/constipation but then again a baby ten days old really can't tell you what is going on. 

Ren- I will try to call you back today I promise. Other half and I are still catching up on lost sleep. We were both up with little J for over a 24 hour period. 

My parents came down yesterday and had a great visit. They let us sleep for a little bit. Of course little J slept the entire time **sighs** but it was still really nice. Seeing my mom in total bliss with her grandson was really nice. I thought it might be overwhelming but it was all right.

I still have a lot of fears regarding my mother in law but I think those are starting to slip. My over paranoid self keeps coming up with reasons to be paranoid then she does the opposite of what I think and it makes me feel good. 

Other half is still being remarkably patient and caring when it comes to how and what is going on. I love having someone to share the burden with that still cares in the end.

I am now up and moving around all the time. Have started weening myself off the pain meds a couple of weeks early and I am ok with that considering the pain level really has decreased a lot. We have a lot of follow up appointments this week which I am not looking forward to but Other half and I have developed a system for when we go out now which is really cool. 

We had the pediatrician appointment from hell. It was really bad. I usually don't complain when doctors offices accept Medicaid .... in fact I am all for it but when you make someone that has an appointment for 2:45 wait two hours to take quite literally first come first serve, it gets aggravating. Then to be told to wait in a patient room for the hospital to fax over paperwork so they can see if you possibly need more tests...... we were through at that point. Like I said the appointment was for 2:45, we didn't actually leave the office till 5:30. Other half and I could have dealt with something like that just fine but when you have a newborn in tow it is quite different. Their needs are much more consistent and frequent to be waiting like that. Needless to say I have a new pediatrician for him but we have to wait for a little bit for the appointment. I think we will be all right. Google is a wonderful tool. 

Anyway I am hoping to dump all of these photos into photo bucket soon .... I keep saying that but one of these days it will come true. We have just been super crazy busy. 

Hugs to all that want one before I fall over.

Off to try and get some sleep. Other half's shift now."

"event","Well after three days in the hospital and a couple of days to recover .... I am feeling pretty good. 

Other half and I brought home an absolutely beautiful baby boy on Friday. Little J was born on the 24th. I am hoping I did this right by attaching his little website/birthing announcement. 

http://www.babiesonline.com/babies/j/jeb

Speaking of which this site is actually pretty cool. Anyway if you type in his name you should be able to see. We were even able to put up some photos. 

Nights have been rough but otherwise I have been doing great. Other half and I are doing really well with keeping it even and making sure to get enough sleep. Still having some issues walking but I think I am definitely recovering faster than I thought I would. 

The hospital was definitely a wonderful experience. The nurses were wonderful. We did have a few snafus but you are going to get that with anything. The one person that we both had a big problem with was the lactation consultant. I have never been completely knocked down emotionally by someone I didn't know before. That lady really needs to get another job. Anyway we had lots of family and friends come over to meet and visit us which was wonderful. Both other half and I were just thrilled when we were told we could come home. We had finished putting together the nursery the night before we went in so everything was ready when we came home. 

All in all it has been a very pleasant experience that I am really glad I will never have to go through again. Little J is very precious and a very sweet tempered baby. Doesn't really cry that much which makes it much easier to adjust to. Other half and I feel truly blessed. 

I hope all is well with everyone.

Hugs to those that want one."

The doctors scheduled the C-section for June 24 at 7:30 but to be honest all of them are now telling me that I will most definitely go into labor before then. *Shakes head* Why schedule then be like yeah that may not happen? I don't know. They are now talking maybe next week so for everyone that is curious to know ...... I have no idea. I will post all of the info after I get back from the hospital, usually about three days after actual birth. 

Definitely boy and is weighing at 6 pounds and 7 ounces right now. Healthy as can be. Just his mom is falling completely apart.

"event","Hello. 

Today has been a little of a frustrating day. I am still trying to figure out how to get some pictures on here but we have some oh so cute pictures. 

It has been a very stressful couple of weeks for us. With packing to move, contractions, and just the everyday BS of sitting in traffic to and from work. We are pretty lucky to have a lot of friends that have been helping us. Everything is slowly moving but for some reason it is just moving too slow for me. 

The baby is doing great. We have one more month before we bring home a small wiggly thing which is just agonizing for us. We are excited but on the other hand I am just done with all of the pain and tiredness. I am so glad that this is definitely my last one. No one can convince me otherwise at this point and well if I offend anyone I am sorry but I have too many medical problems for this. My parents threw us a surprise baby shower the day before mother's day and that was really nice. I was thoroughly surprised with everything. The help was oh so neccessary considering that neither my other half or myself were anywhere near ready to bring a newborn home. I am frankly not used to that aspect which scares the crap out of me everyday but I have been told over and over again that everything will be fine. There was some games and laughter and people there that I didn't expect. It was nice having the family there with no arguments or pissing contests.

I am so not ready but ready for this all at the same time. They are now saying either the week of my b-day (oh joy) or the week after for the c-section. 

Wish me luck!

To all that may have read the original post, I developed a conscious and could not honestly leave the original up. 

I will just say that I am really not happy with some of the current situations and feel that some people really need to get a firm grasp on the difference between material things and the baser emotional moments of life. This one aspect of my life is a very inconstant and difficult one to handle. It has finally become a little too much for my overly sensitive, hormone'd out person to deal with. 

Otherwise we are doing great and are dealing with the various other things that have come our way. I will mention again we are finally moving which both my other half and myself are really happy about.

Anyway as I sit here I am being kicked and bumped around by a very active little boy from what the docs tell me. They are still all over me but things have oddly been getting better. We had a very nice but crazy Easter. We visited with little R monster that is not so little anymore. She will be five this summer and is getting tall. We have our other regular visitor with us and she is turning nine this Friday. I can't believe how fast all of these kids are growing up now a days. We were also informed this afternoon that one of my uncle's past away on Easter. I am not too horribly upset because he passed very peacefully and deserved his reward. He was a very loving and honest person that always took care of everything that stepped through his front door. His mind had already mostly gone and he was feeding his rug crackers in the end. We all loved him very much though.

In the end everything will be all right I guess.

Anyone else hear about the ice shelf breaking off yesterday? Wow, global warming hitting us by storm. 

Hopefully I can go home and get some sleep soon.

I just got some good news before I finish this and move on with my day. WE are moving. YAY!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway as usual with pregnancy and me, we don't get a long. This is why I am hopefully not having any more kids. I started contracting last week and they put me on meds but I have heard everything from don't do this and don't do that to just go lay down. The baby is fine. There is no real emergency. All is well in the land of extra pumped hormones.... I promise. Just more uncomfortable and akward times for yours truly. Oh yeah and now I have to see the darn doc's once a week compared to once a month. This is just tooooo expensive.

As usual things for me have been a semi mess. I can't say complete because well there are definitely a lot of positive things recently. 

Other half and I are doing wonderful. We are going strong. In fact as of July we will be welcoming an addition to the family. I am actually quite excited and so is the rest of family/extended family. Little R monster is doing wonderful. She lost her front two teeth. :) I have been in more contact recently and she is just a big bunch of absolute confusing joy to be around. My new job is going great, more money, but still going good so far. I like it and it is semi normal for me. Other members not mentioned above are doing well.

We have had some issues regarding Holiday planning. You know how it is ... everyone wants to see you and the planning is just horrible plus with throwing up and sleeping 14 hours a day on the weekend, we really don't want to go anywhere. Holiday's .... well we are seeing family but we are spreading it out a little bit because of my tiredness and sickiness. We thought we wouldn't be home because of travel so I have not even put up one strand of lights. I think now I might put up lights and stuff since we will be home. Haven't decided yet. Anyway just dropping a paragraph or two to let you people that are still interested know that, yes I am still alive."

We are also planning an absolutely wonderful fall season this year. Other half and I decided that with all of the drama/business in the first half of our one year of marriage that we would take time to do some of the things that we wanted to do before. 

The little R monster is having her first soccer game next Saturday which should be a learning experience on top of being just out and out hillarious. I don't know about anyone else but seeing a group of four year olds trying to play soccer is a hoot but it is also fun for all involved. 

Work has been going on a up swing and I should be starting school this spring for my associates in business administration. I am really excited about that because I not only have my family and loved ones supporting me but also my new found friend/coworkers supporting me as well. That is a new feeling all together. I think I have found my nich in the business/professional world. YAY!!!!!!!!

I am overall doing much better. Have been much happier and have been able to smile a lot more regarding the world. 

We are making an appearance at Renn fair this year. I will be introducing other half for the first time to a lot of people and it should after all is said and done be a lovely visit. 

I look forward to seeing many of you because I honestly and truly miss you guys a lot.

I feel a little behind on the times. I didn't even realize that my first wedding anniversary was coming up until someone mentioned it the other day. 

This summer has been busy. Other half and I have been ironing out a lot of personal and family issues this summer on top of trying to keep ourselves cool from the heat. We have been camping a couple of times and made a couple of quick breaks for it off to the unknown but other than that we have been home bodies. We did make a trip to NC at the begining of summer and that was wonderful. Had never been to NC before. Flat land with no real personality to it but it still was exciting.

We have also had the rounds of kids coming in and out this summer so sorry to all of those that we have tried to get together with but haven't been able to.

With the job I ran into a couple of old friends I didn't think I would talk to again and it has been wonderful having the every now and then chat in front of the building. It is really nice to catch up with people now, especially with all of the changes in my life and in me physically. I mean come, one loosing 45lbs in one summer is a little bit of a change physically. 

Still smiling and keeping happy. Other half and I are doing great as usual. Still fighting for those moments of ""Alone time"" but we sneak them.

Hugs and good wishes to everyone. I know I have missed birthdays but would feel absolutely embarrassed to list them so HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO EVERYONE I HAVE MISSED THIS YEAR.

"event","Ok ..... I have become accustomed to life's twists and turns but this weekend plus the next two weekends are throwing hard balls at me. I guess everyone goes through the period in their life where everything is moving on and is going to whatever pace it feels like but you are just hanging in barely with one finger trying to deal with all the changes. It reminds me of a really bad roller coaster that you know that at the end you are going to get sick.

I am hoping to get ready and do a monumental thing that I have been nagged, bugged, pressured, and have been told I should have done for years. Not many people can say that I didn't give this thing a great effort but the never ending heart tugging combined with the logistics of how a family should be raised is starting to come into play. I don't want to end up hurting anyone just by my presence of being in their life. I am tired of it. Plus the original problem from so many years ago ...... ok .... that is a little bit of an exaggeration but hey it feels like it, all the key people that were involved have moved on with their lives. My turn. I have a husband, beautiful stepdaughter, and a life to live without this constantly pulling or being there to stop what I want to do. Sorry not many details but I really feel that this has held me back from a lot of things. 

The other issue is when siblings grow up. My wonderful brother, who was just the cutest thing as a baby is now fourteen. I find it funny when I get the knowledge of how he is handling ""Teenage-dom"". I think my mother is not dealing with it very well because my brother and I were so different. Then there is how we were raised. We have eleven years between the two of us. It is hard especially since I want to give him his freedom when he is here. I just don't know very well where to balance the line between friends and adult taking care of teen. My little brother and I don't really have the adult to child kind of relationship. I figure he needs someplace of refuge while going through this time in his life. Didn't we all wish to be somewhere else while a teenager stuck at mom and dads house? I know I did.

Then there is the grandparents. You have the one with the beginnings of Dimentia on top of a life long battle with diabetes. Then on the other side you have one that is fighting with plain and simple getting old who can't see really well, can't hear really well, can't walk very well, but still insists on doing everything themselves. I think I would be like that *Smiles* 

Then you have the ex-wife/stepdaughter situation. Now I have to explain. That first sentence you must be thinking chaos and misery all over the place because of what you see now a days with custody battles and what not. It is not like that. I love my stepdaughter to pieces and she is a great kid. The ex-wife is not that bad. We never fight, argue, get upset at each other or for that matter ..... really talk to each other. I do have some problems with her judgement regarding a few things but it is not one of those type of situations where I would go and confront her on them. They are her decisions and it is her child. It is that simple in my head. I can love the daughter to death without stepping all over everyones toes. I know how to do this. I have done it for years with my own daughter. The trick to all of this is listening and being there for my husband that unfortunately usually gets the butt end of the deals regarding his daughter because first the ex-wife will step all over him then his mother will try with her parade and then I get to deal with what is leftover. It is not nice. The constant begging for money when you supposedly have money, the constant not willing to do anything ....down to lifting a finger regarding visitation visits, and the constant you are not spending enough time with you daughter or caring for her properly would get to anyone. Now I know I just went into huge detail there. I probably shouldn't have but again this is not your typical ex-wife/stepdaughter situation. Again I mean no disrespect to these people.

I am dealing with life's twists and turns as best as I can right now. Keeping myself straight is the key role in all of this and I know it. That is the other thing. When you realize ..... hey I have been doing ok then realize that actually no you haven't. I am going for more rounds of doctors appointments soon. I came up negative for breast cancer so that is a plus. Hopefully everything is fine. 

Again keeping myself straight with daily vitamins, exercise, and love. Sorry I don't keep in better contact but at least now you have an idea of why. I keep all of this to myself. That is my new motto .....don't bug anyone else with the things that only you can deal with. 

Hugs and love to all that want some."

I finally was able to figure out a couple of things with the computers. YAY!!!! Anyway I have established a Photo bucket account where I am currently putting the wedding photos and our honey moon pictures on display. 

We have been really busy with our personal life recently. Therapists, doctors, lawyers, and we have been trying the friend factor too. It has just been crazy. 

I get to go have fun with some really cool gadgets soon. The doctor thinks that I have some severe issues going on. We have yet to hear from the first rounds of tests so I shall have to wait and see. Other half and I are doing good considering.

"event","I sit here looking back realizing that I am not happy with past events but I don't regret anything. I mean yeah there are things that if I could have changed I probably would but man it happened. It is over. 

I find myself in this circle right now. It is very hard to move away from the motion but it just repeats and repeats and repeats itself. I am trying to make ovals or corners and it won't let me. My emotions are so repetitive with this circle that it is very predictable. I have made achievements, changed habits in my life, started acting and eating more healthy, and it is never enough. More changes need to be made in order to leave this circle but am I ready?

That is the question that I am pondering right now. Am I Ready? I don't know and I don't know when I will ever be ready. It is kinda like that feeling that you get when you know you are jumping into an extremely cold pool. You know the water is going to be cold and you are going to suffer and shiver but you do it anyway. Some people agonize over it by taking an extremely long time to ""Adjust to the water"" other people jump right in like the choice was not that hard for them. Like so what it is going to be cold. I wish I could be like that. I would like to say no I am not ready. It is too big a step but would I be shorting myself by saying it is too much? 

I am sorry if none of this makes sense but if it makes the wondering mind feel any better it helped me to have seen all of this written down. 

Hugs and Hellos!"

"event","Merry X-mas and Happy New Years or Happy Holidays. However you would prefer it. 

Where to start? In July the little R monster turned three. She is getting so big. In August not much really happened. In September I was able to free myself from the most horrible job I have ever taken in my life. I was working with a new company the next week. In October my other half and I got married. I will be putting some photos up as soon as we have some that I can share on the computer. It turned out beautifully. He was really handsome and everything turned out really well. His family from MS came up and it was really nice meeting them for the first time. We took a one week honey moon and went to Black Water Falls, WV and had a great time. We rented a cabin up there for two nights and then took the other three days to get our stuff together before going back to work. Plus they were expecting snow and I had to get my name changed. I still have to change my name on some things but all of the important stuff was done in good time. Was impressed by that because I thought it took forever to change your name. We celebrated Thanksgiving here this year and had a wonderful dinner. My brother actually came down to spend the holiday with us which was nice. We spent the Christmas holiday at home this year and I have to tell you that it was really nice not having to drive to three different houses in one day. We did have a little excitement Christmas Eve when I stupidly locked us out of our house and then an hour later had to watch my husband climb a fifteen foot ladder to let us back in. Third floor apartments are hard to get into if you get locked out on holidays! I checked myself into counseling back in late November. I feel that it is helping me substantially. I was also registering for classes but have decided that I will probably start school in the summer this year. Finally going back to college. I can't wait. Other half and I have been doing wonderful since the wedding. We have made a lot of vast improvements with our selves since we have met. I really have not been much company to be around. I have had a lot of anxiety issues so getting out of the house sometimes seems like a huge chore. E-bay came in handy when it came to shopping for Christmas. I have decided that when it comes to shopping for things I love E-bay. After all that is where I purchased my wedding dress! I am hoping to have photos of all of these wonderful events in photo bucket really soon. I am in the process of developing our pictures from the honey moon and the pictures from the wedding have to be decided on before I can do anything with those. **Sighs** I highly apologize to everyone that I have not been in contact with. I hope this explains a little bit. I do miss everyone. I have been trying to get myself together enough to possibly come visit some people. We are still making rounds from the Wedding. It has taken us a while and I do apologize for that. 

I am hoping that the New Year brings wonderful things and events to everyone. Hugs to all that want one. I will be back on again soon."

"event","Hello-
It has been a while. Things here have been decent. I lost my job not that long ago due to error on their part. Telling me during the interview when I was first hired with them that taking time off for the wedding and honeymoon was not going to be a problem. Then three weeks before the wedding I am told that I now can't take this time off unless certain things get done. Then two days later given the option of staying on or finding other employment then two hours later was told to leave. Bad company. I am glad I am gone though. I was hired today with another company so I am not to worried about finding another job. I was really stressing there for a minute thinking of not only preparing for the wedding but also looking for a job. 

The wedding is going to be so wonderful. Things have really come together wonderfully. I can't wait to see a bunch of people and share our experience. We have the marriage license and are prepared mostly for the wedding. The wedding gifts we are making by scratch are going to come out nice too I think. Oh and the wedding gown is going to be so gorgeous. I can't wait to show off. 

Other half and I are doing great. School just started for him so work and school are his main things. I have taken on a couple of side projects and hopefully will be looking into starting school myself. Now that I know what I want to go to school for it will be a lot easier. I have been poking my head online as well lately. Breaking out of the shell for a little bit before becoming completely hitched. (LOL). 

I forgot to mention that with everything going on we have both lost weight. I have lost about 40 pounds now and my other half has lost some as well. ( Just to update earlier postings)

Well I am off for now. Miss you all and hugs to all that want one."

Well first on my list. In two weeks I will be at my current job for three months. Tomorrow my daughter is turning three. The wedding is still in full progress and invitations should be going out soon. Just a matter of making an appointment and finishing them. Other half and I are doing wonderful. We celebrated our year engagement on the fourth of July and have been living comfortably together for more than six months. We are getting ready to do the move thing in a couple of months as well as most people I have seen. We also have started getting prepared for the married life which is great for couples to do when they are getting married. The whole bill thing just sucks but we all have to do it. I have had some off and on bouts of depression but those are getting easier to handle. I have checked in with a couple of people but lately I have been safely tucked in my little hole in the wall enjoying life but not the heat. 

Hugs and loves to all that want them and back to work I go.

"event","Today has been interesting. I was checking all of the bills that have online addresses and found out that Comcast was trying to really screw us this month. I have been complaining about Comcast since we had it installed in our apartment. Well today was the day that Comcast is leaving our house. I was able to get a phone line, DSL and direct TV with no deposit through Verizon for the same amount of money we were paying for our high speed internet through Comcast. Three things versus one ...... hmmmmmm... let me think. From there it turned into a complaining kind of day. I called Sears and completely chewed them out for the poor quality pictures that were taken of other half and I. Very poor quality. The lady actually left us in the middle of taking pictures to go and pay for her take out food. Then instead of sitting with us to go over the pictures she went in the back and ate her dinner. There was no one in front of us or coming in after us and we literally were there for maybe twenty minutes. Very poor shots and her version of a head shot of other half and I turned out to be full body nasty shots. YUCK. Anyway I was told that we would be contacted later to setup another sit down for pictures. The two we do have are not that bad but are still pretty crappy. Now normally I would not complain but these are our engagement photos that we are supposed to be sending to family and friends so I naturally want them to look nice. I am not very photogenic to begin with but hey she could have done better. Plus looking for a nice wedding dress is not easy. Other half and I are probably going to go for another hike tonight after he gets off work. We are trying to loose weight together and it has become fun and interesting for us. I think we are doing really well even though our weigh-ins don't reflect much change yet. We have changed our diet and are having a little fun with it. I have been working really hard recently on many projects all at once so I apologize to everyone if I kinda have been tucked in my hole a little too long. It has been really busy. We are doing rather well though. My monitor crapped out on us for a little bit but we have a temporary for right now. *Sighs* I think that is all that has been going on as of late.

There are some really good prospects and it looks like I could have something rather soon. That situation has been getting a little better. 

Wedding stuff is really underway with all persons involved helping to make this a wonderful event. Other half and I have put together some really nice ideas for the wedding and since it is being moved up a couple of months to a fall wedding it is going to be really pretty. It is stressful and hard work though. 

We have been doing ok .... actually better then ok. Well I am off and running I have a lot of errands to run and people that I have to talk to. *Sighs*.

I am no longer part of the unemployed population that seems to keep growing. Big HOORAY!!!!! I will be starting in a week and the job is pretty decent. Decent hours, a commute that I can't argue and at a rate that I just can't refuse. Life is good. Now we can finally get back on track financially. We haven't been doing too bad but it would be nice to feel like we are happily swimming instead of just barely keeping float. *Takes deep breath* I went and visited the little R monster yesterday. Wonderful visit. We were out in the nice fresh air and sunshine and she was just giggling and laughing up a storm. She looks so much like both of her parents that it is really scary. Anyway the wedding plans are finally underway. The big day is going to come too quickly. *Sighs* No matter what happens or where it is we will have fun. That is the best quality about the other half and I. No matter what situation we find ourselves in it always turns out in the end. I just got done scrubbing the house down. It was just to icky for me. Doing normal laundry for the weekend. Starting to get used to the weekend schedule. It is not easy. Becoming a step mom is not easy either. Arrrrggggggg. It is not really bothering me but sometimes frustrates me if that makes any sense. Well anyway I have said too much as it is and need to think about dinner plans. I have become so domestic!!!"

<br />and require kindness. They resist
<br />confrontation at all costs. (Feeling good is
<br />more important than being good.) They are
<br />typically quiet by nature, they process
<br />things very deeply and objectively, and they
<br />are by far the best listeners of all the
<br />colors. They respect people who are kind, but
<br />recoil from perceived hostility or verbal
<br />battle.

WHITES need their quiet independence and refuse to
<br />be controlled by others. WHITES want to do
<br />things their own way, in their own time. They
<br />ask little of others, and resent others
<br />demanding much of them. WHITES are much
<br />stronger than people think because they dont
<br />reveal their feelings. WHITES are kind,
<br />non-discriminate, patient and can be
<br />indecisive, timid, and silently stubborn.
<br />When you deal with a WHITE, be kind, accept
<br />(and support) their individuality, and look
<br />for nonverbal clues to their feelings.

It was really pretty waking up to the big flakes of snow coming down this morning but I am sure every working adult out there will tell me how much hell they went through this morning getting to work. It was nice though. I hope all is well and life is good. Have a safe one.

Propensity for Monogamy:

Your propensity for monogamy is medium.
In general, you prefer to have only one love interest.
But it's hard for you to stay devoted for too long!
There's too much eye candy to keep you from wandering.

Experience Level:

Your experience level is high.
You've loved, lost, and loved again.
You have had a wide range of love experiences.
And when the real thing comes along, you know it!

Dominance:

Your dominance is low.
This doesn't mean you're a doormat, just balanced.
You know a relationship is not about getting your way.
And you love to give your sweetie a lot of freedom.

Cynicism:

Your cynicism is medium.
You'd like to believe in true and everlasting love...
But you've definitely been burned enough to know better.
You're still an optimist, but you also are a realist.

Independence:

Your independence is high.
You don't need to be in love, and sometimes you don't even want love.
Having your own life is very important for you...
Even more important than having a relationship.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivevariablelovetest/"">The Five Variable Love Test</a></div

You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

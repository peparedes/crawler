Things are goin pretty swell. I am living in 5 points with Jane/Jim...some of you know Him/Her around Huntsville as Jackie Chan or by Her music 'TENSESTRIPPER'. We are in a polyamerous/swinger BDSM relationship and I am Her sub. Most of you who know me know I am NOT a sub in any other area of my life ;) In fact I am in search of a slave or two right now and have been for a minute. Anyhow, I am doing swell, have a handful of businesess, a maid service, a web design business at http://www.aadiawebsolutions.homestead.com/ and I am still a pro dominatrix. My father attempted suicide again and I am having Him commited, besides that there has not been the level of choas I used to have in my world. Mom is learning to walk again after Her accident last year. I am sober for the most part. I see my kids when I can...when my ex hubby is not being a dick. I have been getting involved at the Flying Monkey Arts Center, Jim and I have been writing poetry for open mike night, He has been working on His D.J. music and I have been getting back into doing art etc...and that is about it. I had lost control of my e-mail associated with this account due to identity theft but I proved to MSN that the account was mine fuinally so here I am back in black. So good to be back. I am addicted to starbucks and myspace just like the rest of America...so, if you want to find me on myspace to see more of what has been happening my name on there is Demighoul Girl. Catch you all later xo Vamplustgrl"

"event","PLEASE HELP ME???
   I need a place to stay temporarily until I can find an apartment, no longer than a month but probably much less. I rented a storage unit and already moved my valuables, my computer and electrronics, clothes I do not wear, and some of my sentimental stuff just in case someone else trys to rob me. For those who do not know, someone broke into my house Thursday while I was asleep and stole my money, my credit cards and my nerve pills. They could have hurt me. I have also had my porch vandalised, potted plants thrown against the house, ketchup smeared all over my car, rotten poisoned meat put in my dog's dish and He got sick from it, my car keyed, and keep getting prank phone calls. Jim is staying with me to protect me till I get the rest of my stuff. If He is not here then Wolf has been here.
   I am willing to pay for a room if someone out there can rent me one for two or three weeks. I can pay in advance. I have a house trained well behaved dog, He is a black dog named Fonzie and He has a profile on my friend's list. I also have 2 grade school age children who visit with me for a couple of days through the week, if it is a problem then I can visit with them at a friend's house. Please let me know if you can help me! I am really scared and I need to get out of this neighborhood fast!

"event","Sorry I have not been around much lately. I have become addicted to myspace, but I cannot forget my friends here, I miss you guys!

Damn! Haha, where do I begin? I live in the ghetto, yet none like you have ever seen or experienced. This place is somewhere between 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' verses 'Jerry Springer' It is a real love/hate place. All of the people who live here say they want to move every month, but there is this sick sense of wonder that keeps us all here. Like almost the end of a suspense novel that you have to get through the last 100 pages before you sleep but it never ends. Exciting and exausting. Thrilling and annoying. 

I remember Thanksgiving was extra eventful as I got to witness a real turkey being thrown at a woman by her husband and she promptly took off after him never spilling her beer. That was cool. Then the same day there was the local drug dealer who hit the dumpster in his cadilac and pushed it down the block then passed out in his sunday's finest suspenders, crack pipe in one hand, needle in the other with his family of ten chaseing on foot behind. That is the kind of drama that really cracks me up! Gimme some white trash drama over games of the heart anyday! 

So, today was a real jewel and it has spawned the need in me to share with my beloved pals who are addicted to a perfect world in a box. I awoke with a phone call and a knock to the door. Shaking off the Xanex haze I answered the phone and the door at the same time. The wacked alcoholic landlords son ran extension cords through the house to fix my falling in kitchen floors a day before the housing authority is supposed to inspect, while I rushed around cell in one hand phone in the other, clipboard full of work to be finished in the same hand as my cell. Asking children if they had eaten or needed drinks as I juggled all the daily tasks at hand. Dog begins getting sick and my neighbor comes over screaming her cat had been poisoned. So accidently pulling the real phone off the table, still with cell and clipboard in hand I rush outside to see several neighbors with arms of leaves covering all these green chemical puddles. Someone from down the block said her dogs were sick also, so with one of my friends advise I called the fire dept. The kids were all on the porch mesmerized by the huge fire trucks and I smiled at having caused such entertainment for them. Come to find out the business that is behind my house had a huge barrel of chemicals with a pump in it and a pipe that led into the street covered by trees so you could not see it. My phone is ringing off the hook as well as my cell. A little black girl who I call Paris Hilton because she is always carrys her dog in her arm calls and comes by to pick up something while the HAZMAT truck pulls up, sirens could be heard all over Huntsville. Kids are watching and laughing, I am still writing and talking to people on the cell, making business calls, saw buzzing from under the floor, giving the dog some Gatoraid per the Vet's advise. The news team shows up, camera's flashing, kids watch horror movies and out the door at all the chaos. Twenty people float in and out of the house, up and down the street, my phone constantly ringing or me making calls, writing on my clipboard, typing on the computer, give the landlord's son a narcotic so he does not drink too much and finishes the job so we don't fall through the floor, tell the kids to take a shower. My roommate shows up and takes out a dead ratt in a trap, I think they get so big because of the damn chemicals, mutant ratts big as cats! The stove, bike, screen door and refridgerator that decorated my yard for so long are moved by workers, I guess so the news camera won't pick up a shot of how Kromis neglects her ghetto. Speaking of Ms. Kromis, the wicked landlady of this fine Love Canal scoots down the street in a Micheal Jackson moonwalk with her little vicious Taco Bell doglike barking assistant. Kids laughing and playing, uncle shows up, two friends stop by, one calls, I am trying to continue working talking to ten people at once it seems. Dog barfs again, landlord's son emerges from under the porch, beer in hand talking in spirals, asking uncle how mom is, friends move my new computer in, tell the kids not to play too close to the street, drop the cell, clean up dog barf, be courteous on the phone and remember to act professional, write on my paper taking notes, laugh at the landlord's son's weird joke I don't understand, vietnam vet and his niece stop in to add to the clusterfuck and the dog barfs again. Call the vet, more Gatoraid for Fonzie, pop a pill, tell the kids to get their stuff together, put on some lipstick, squeeze a ciggarette in, and talk to the investigator about the chemical spill. 

A friendly firefighter comes to thank me for calling, He says that they had been pumping chemicals into the nieghborhood for years and that the ground water might be contaminated for a mile around us, and that if my dog has to go to the vet the owner of the chemicals will pay. My kid's father and his lady show up, she is sick so I try to help, daughter crying cause she does not like goodbyes, I wave till they are out of sight, a pain going through my gut because I will miss them. 

Back to work, take a friend to the doctor, watch HAZMAT leave as we do, while my friend is in the doctor's office I pass out for a kind 20 minutes, get coffee drinks, visit with uncle till 1:00 a.m., flirt with a guy on the computer, pop a pill, try to hook up the computer, run into a million issues getting it hooked up, friend calls to gossip, fuck off on myspace for a moment to write this, pop a couple of pills and now back to work. 

WHEW! It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood! And I find time to get bored? WTF?!?! The cool thing is I stay absolutely entertained and busy as fuck everyday, I will rest when I am dead. And the pay off is that everything gets done. I guess the chemicals are what is wrong with all the weirdos around here, that includes me! We are all Toxic! The dog is feeling a little better now, poor guy."

I cannot wait to get home and dance to some real music. I got the Johnny Cash Murder collection, has all of his murder songs...it fucking kicks ass! I also got Dead Can Dance's new c.d. and a couple of rockabilly c.d.s and a c.d. player. I love this song:

""Delia's Gone""

Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life 
If I hadn't have shot poor 
Delia I'd have had her for my wife 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis 
And I met Delia there Found her in her parlor 
And I tied to her chair 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

She was low down and trifling 
And she was cold and mean 
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

First time I shot her I shot her in the side 
Hard to watch her suffer 
But with the second shot she died 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer,
I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside 
I hear the patter of Delia's feet 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

So if you woman's devilish 
You can let her run 
Or you can bring her down and do her 
Like Delia got done 
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone



Yeah, I think it is so beautiful. We are hittin the road in the morning. I cannot wait to go the hell home. I miss home. I love having a home of my own, it will get better...I have to allow myself to be a little off in the head sometimes cause i am doing killer compared to a couple of months ago! Need to learn to be good to myself and develope some passion about life. Travel and see the world without having to depend on anyone. Become myself again, no, for the first time! I am excited.

Yeah, mom got in an accident down here and broke her neck between c3 and c6 she may never walk again but she is getting moved tommarrow to rehab and I am coming home. I look so forward to it. She has the right attitude to get as much functioning as possible. Yeah, single life is strange. I have gone out with a few guys....their are guys who actually treat me nice....weird. I am staying single for a long time and I look forward to it. So many beautiful boys and girls but i will never give my heart away till I am myself again, or perhaps for the first time. Stolen youth I have to recover from and just work with what i have..."

I cannot let my fear and emotions run my days anymore. So many people in my life; family, friends and lovers have given up all hope for me ever taking responsibility for my own life.

I have had the love of my life, John and he will always be loved and believed in by me. He is out there in a paradise seeking his happiness and dreams. But I cannot be afraid anymore. I have to trust that he will be alright, that he cares about me and focus on my own life right now.  Kathy and Alex are supposed to come over tonight...can't wait to hang out with them.

I recieved a letter from John. He has moved to Florida. He has not read my e-mails or anything. I have poured out my soul and it fell on deaf ears. He said ""Goodbye."" and never said he loved me at all. I have been so nice since he left and offered him my friendship and unconditional love, tried to understand, forgiveness for everything he ever did, apologized for my wrongs and offered him anything he needs. Told him I would always be here and that I would watch over his mother while he was gone. And now he lives in Florida, all settled in, getting a job and forgeting me.  So many people lied to me and have been rude that I thought were both of our friends. It does not make me angry but really breaks me down that I trusted so much. I feel hurt by everyone involved. I hope they are all celebrating my pain. This is mean.
  I burn bridges and sabatoge relationships before the other person has a chance to leave me or hurt me. Then I seek a bunch of sympathy for running amuck as a victim screaming for mercy. Yes, sick it is quite in a way but also self protective. When I catch a glimpse of someone I love catching the bottom of my skirt on fire I am like, okay, fine, lets catch my whole body on fire and yours too motherfucker! Then everyone is dead and I am some burnt crawly thing covered in ashes slithering around undead all alone. 
     Why I should care about people who reject me or do not want to be my friends? Probably going back to my childhood when I could never please my father and always chased after him to love me and be proud of me I guess. But I have always chosen lovers and friends like that who are so filled with their own issues they don't have the capacity to love anyone but themsleves. 
     One thing I will say in my own defense is that noone can blame me for at least being honest. 
      I miss my love but he wanted to go and there is nothing I can do about it. So, I will leave him alone and I guess try to accept his goodbye even though it is so hard to believe. And the people around him who are his influences now, I will stop beating a dead horse trying to be close to them."

I would however appreciate a courtesy call as he was my best friend for 6 years...but you never know a person now do ya? However, here are some things I have heard:
 
CURRENT JOHN SPOTTINGS:

-- John spotted at the Coppertop sipping  martinis with Jimmy Hoffa 
-- John spotted recklessly scaling the Leaning Tower of Pisa 
-- A wooly John, spotted by a frightened elf, stalking Santa at the North Pole 
-- A stark-naked John has been spotted at New York bar Coyote Ugly; patrons report him swinging from the ceiling fan with what looked like dollar bills clenched in his teeth. 
-- John spotted at a rural mobile home village, with his pants around his ankles and a 40 oz. beverage in hand, swaying to and fro while singing ""this is how we do it at tha trailer park par-tay!"" 

The last sighting is probably the most possible as this is how I found him 6 years ago.

"event","I am single now. No other person owns me. Last night had a small gathering with my slave from Boston and several people. We drank cocktails and played the game Sorry. My slave waited on us all. Then after this Me and my slave...Albert is his name...went to Visions strip club. I got pretty lit and was stuffing dollars in the ladies pants like a pro...then Albert got me a private lap dance by this long haired beauty...wow!!! She was awesome. So, after that I was in a pretty good mood and we went to Waffle House. John calls. First contact I have had in a week. He just moans a few times and it took a minute to get him to speak. He says ""I guess I miss you"" I started crying and told him that I missed him also. He then asks where I am and he wants me to ask Albert to take me to come get him. Albert of course agrees. We wolf down our grub and head to get him. My heart and head was reeling. We get there and noone would answer the door so I call. He finally opens the door and he is dead drunk. He forgot calling me apparently.He just asked me to hold him. I did and I asked if he wanted to come home, ""no"" he said quietly. I asked then,""are we broke up, can I move on with my life am I single"" he said softly,""yes"" as he shook his head up and down as if he had programed it for some time, rehearsed this news in frount of the mirror to convince himself. I asked him if he needed anything, he wanted money but I told him to call me later on or something and I'd try to get him some as I found it a little weird considering at the time. He said friends were coming to get him tommarrow and that he would be gone. He said he wanted his dad's things back. I asked again,""Are you certain that you are breaking up with me forever?"" No more chances? no maybeys?"" He said ""yes"" nodding sadly. He wanted me to stay and hold him but I had to leave. I gave him a kiss and tucked him in. Locked the door behind me and closed a 6 year chapter in my life. He was the love of my life. We were dangerous. The gruesome twosome. He was my Sid and I, his Nancy. Bonny and clyde. Natural born killers. Beautiful. Like the wind. I will forever love him. Now I face this grim reality with a heavy heart and walk in knee deep mud to find I do not know what. I was to be in my final resting place one day beside John. I was to have his name. We were going to have another baby that doen't die. We were going to be infamous. But it is all over now. My tears are endless. I am broken."

I hate when I have to eat crow. I hate when I absently hurt people I love in stupidity. Glad however, that the ones I love are as forgiving as they are. Some good things can come out of chaos. I feel like some people have let me in and given me new chances to prove myself. It is a lie that you don't have to prove yourself to anyone. It is also a lie that what other's think is not important...sometimes it is important. Everything I have lived by is upside down now. I don't know why it takes me swimming in garbage sometimes to want to change but I guess it takes what it takes. My lover has been dealing with our recovery from our journey through hell (with a prison sissy as the evil guide) in a different way then me. We have both cried many tears and delt with physical sickness unmeasureable to any I have known before. Cleaning up the mess and trying to pull our skeletons back together to walk among the living better than ever before. Scarey. We both need friends and positive influences right now as we shed a few losers out of our lives. We both really want a life and to put insanity second."

"event","Well, I have changed my journal settings so that anybody in the whole wide world can comment on my journal since I have so many spys out there....so even if you are not on Livejournal...comment away. I was going to delete my journal and my myspace journal because I am tried of spys useing my personal information against me and misinterpreting my personal feelings but then I thought about it. I really have nothing to hide. And if someone takes something I say here wrong or decides to hate me for my private feelings that I tell my friends here then at least now they can comment. I am no snow white. I am tainted by many things. But all I have felt, all I have done and everything that I have been through makes me what I am today...a better person. Everyone learns things at a different speed in life, this is like a school and sometimes people learn things in a really fucked up way that even hurts the people they love most. Regret does nothing productive and I am learning that the only way to fix past mistakes is to take action to do what you can today. It seems some people want me to curl up in some suicidal ball and hate myself to the grave for my mistakes...like there is no forgivness for me...no hope...no change...they want me doomed it seems. It must be horrifying to have so much hate in one's heart. I know because I have hated so many people before and it accomplishes zip...nothing. Resentment is the number one offender to addicts and alcoholics according to the A.A. big book I recall. Resentment causes more hell in people's lives than anything else. I want to live without resentment and realize that these people who hate me are sick like me, I pray for them and I wish them everything that I would want good for myself. I have a long way to go as far as living a productive ""normal"" life but I am trying my little heart out and I don't need anyone coming down on me or not believeing in me. I know that when you see a person fail so much that it is easy to judge that person and make assummptions that they are bad or unable to ever change but stranger things have happened. I wish I could sit here and lie and tell you that I do not care about what anyone thinks about me but the truth is I do care. I care all to much. The most important people that I care about what they think of me are my children. Maybey I don't discuss them here and talk about my private things but they are #1 in my fucking life. I would kill or die for my babies, they are everything. And they believe in me when all you grown ups out there don't. They think I hung the moon and I know they hung the moon! Our love is thicker than any worldly thing. I am trying to get a life here even though I might be a little slower than some."

"event","while stareing out my mother's window yesterday at the linen table cloth restraunt with valet parking I saw her there. I remember the taste of her on my fingers and the soft smell of her in my hair. I hurt her. It was long ago. Age had not taken her beauty...and I watched her smile. She never knew I was watching and will rot in her coffin not knowing. I wish my eyes could blink and I could go back for just 5 minutes. Oh, the drunken laughter. The musky heat. Her gentle embrace. Her scared little salty tears. How I wish I could lay her down on the cold ground and do vile things. I miss her but it is not a shame because I have had her...she was mine. Mine when her open hole was wet for me...mine when she screamed. And in my mind, part of my collected dead. I own what I fuck."

"event","So, I went to the doctor the other day and they double all my meds for my Congestive Heart Failure...now I take 16 pills a day for that. Oh joy. And I went to the psychiatrist yesterday and he starts me on Geodone which is a heavy anti- psychotic for my anger issues, suspicions and delusions etc...I am a fucking walking pharmacy...I take 19 pills a day in total just to keep my brain and body well. Oh yeah and I am not disabled? Right. 2 months till they make the desicion this time and dammit I hope it goes through. I get so depressed about my heart thing....it is fucking with me bad today. I guess maybey because the doctor really jumped my case this week. I have to lose weight now or I could die. I am so scared I won't be able to. If I just had the means to better take care of myself and my family. This country's social security is so screwed up. I am so thirsty and I keep getting more bloated the more I drink...I will be glad when the new dose of my meds begins to work. I guess I will get off this puter now and take a shower. Maybey put on some make up and scare the hell out of my love!"

"event","Fruit that has freezer burn is not that good. Yuck. Oh well...I will eat them anyway....little sour strawberries...possibly a year old. If I never blog again everyone will know I died from the freezer burnt strawberries. Went out to the gay bar Friday...not to entertaining except for the White Russians were tastey and my friend bought me about 10 of them. I got tolerably drunk and woke up with a Krystal hamburger smashed on my face. Always a good sign of a night well spent. Saterday we went out to my friends and grilled out, played on the trampoline and went swimming. My lover stayed wasted all weekend. The kids had fun and my daughter cried when it was time to go back to their Daddy's. My son has something going on with him...something is troubleing him and I can tell but I cannot get him to talk about it. I don't know what to do. He has been getting so angry and just throwing fits...it has nothing to do with what is going on at the moment...I think someone has hurt him or something has happened but he won't talk...I am trying everything to get through to him. Maybey it is just a phase. Both of the kids have a bunch going on right now and the sad thing is that I cannot talk to their Dad about them anymore because He stays angry with me. All I can do is ask the kids questions and try to help them the best I can. It is really frustrating. I know they are both having issues with their new step sister being so spoiled and bossy...regular sibling stuff...they were used to being alone before she came along so I know it is a hard adjustment...probably for all of them. I always thought I would have more of a say in what happens with my children and I have until recently and the kids know it. They know me and love me though and we will always be close even when circumstances separate us. Hopefully one day I can spend more time with them but things are the way they are right now. I have to live with just weekends. I have been sick lately and worried about my health. My congestive heart failure is worse and the doctor had to double all my medications. I have not been able to walk all that well because of my ankles swelling up. I have been staying sober pretty much except drinking Friday. Unfortunately my nights of intoxication will have to be fewer if I am to live longer with this heart problem. It is a terminal illness, I will die from it but dammit I hope I can hang in there as long as possible...I have so much yet to do and I want to see my grand babies...I actually want another baby for myself but that depends on my health....and that money thing....big crisis. I want to go back to school if my disability starts then I can get a good job or begin a business so I can put the kids through college and travel.

So, my landlord asked me if I worshiped Satan the other day. Living at this new place is like riding some psychotic horse through a circus freak tent. Just a summary of events that have transpired over the past 48 hours:

*Gunshots were fired in the direction of our home, 3 cop cars show up

*The pipes bust next door due to faulty plumbing

*4a.m. a giant rat broke into a woman's cupboard and ate 2 boxes of noodles that the woman insists the landlord will pay for

*a fat drunk ex-con with multiple prison tattoos asks for a ride to the beer store. We say no. The landlords son threatens to kill us and bitches us out because of it. Scared we might get evicted we take the guy to the beer store and let him hang out for a night and he pours garbage out on our floor, pisses on the floor and breaks my flower pot on the frount porch as he tries to move my whicker sofa inside for no logical reason....then when I kick him out he shoots fire crackers down the street at us

*one lady that lives behind us insisted her cat was demon posessed because it got out of the tape between her air conditioner and the window sill. 

Christ on a crutch. I cannot handle this! My mom found a new house to move into...I would love to rent her old one but cannot afford it without roommates...anyone interested? It is in 5 points 3 bedrooms and a fenced in backyard on a very nice main street."

Christ on a crutch, I have been put down by the almighty Voltaire! No, I am not a gothic hippy...did not know there was such a thing. As far as hate I wonder about what you are talking about? But as I am sure you don't give a fuck about keeping me as a fan or a friend I am positive you will not enlighten me as to how I might make myself a better person by telling me what the heck attitude problem I had towards someone that was important enough to overlook my love for my dead son. 
You are obviously full of yourself, shallow and don't mean a fucking thing you sing about...I am discusted that I put my son to rest with your sweet voice...I really am. You obviously have never known pain or grief. 
Goodbye is a shame cause I am a very nice person but I guess you have droves of people you can just dispose of at will. Here is the hate you seek~ May my sweet son's soul haunt your words till they fail to be heard.

After getting that first message, I went to your profile to read about your son's funeral. But all I found was post after post of you spewing hate for all manner of people so I decided to not respond. 

And here you are ....spewing hate. 
so yeah, I was right the first time. 

I will happily remove you from my friends list and you won't have to hear my crap anymore and you can just add me to the LONG list of people you already hate.

Oh what a morning. Do I really feel like whining? I hope I am brief about it because I am a woman on the edge! Canned vegetable soup for breakfast oh horray! barf. I am so fucking depressed in this stretch of being absolutely destitute...not broke but destitute!!! I have no ciggarettes, my body is going through unwelcome nicotine withdrawls, no food (hense the vegetable soup), no gas at all and no clients even seem like they might see me this week. I feel like crying. Nevermind...now I am fucking crying. fuck. I have already embarassed myself asking everyone I know for help durring this financial crunch. I feel like such a loser and a failure. I get real mad sometimes and tell myself that I don't care what people think of me but I know I am lieing...the way I was raised social image was important as much as I have always fought the people pleasing side of my personality. I hate that my love has to go to work with no lunch and no ciggs. I hate that my dogs have to eat donated wet food that makes them sick. I had to empty gas from a mower into the car for gas. This sucks. I do not understand why work is sooooo slow right now. Maybey everyone is broke? Maybey it is because of the Hurricane. And what really makes me feel stupid is the fact that I am complaining because all those people are homeless. I wanted to go down there and help but noone would take me...I am still willing to go. I wish I had the resources to help. Wish I did not have Congestive Heart Failure and could physically handle a real job instead of being an escort and doing other non-laborous tasks. If I had money I could help myself so that I could help others. Money is so important...it pisses me off. I have friends in town right now that I would really like to spend time with but what the fuck would we do? Eat canned vegetables and stare at each other? That is worse then a Jerry Lewis Telethon...haha! ;) I did feel like being helplessly intoxicated on whatever free substance I could find for a couple of weeks...even lowered my values to try things that I would never do just to escape this poverty dry spell. But now, even the drugs and alcohol have worn out their welcome in my tired veins. I have crashed mentally. I want a goddamn steak! And some fucking Marlboro light 100's in the box. Fuck. I am crying again. I sound so stupid."

Whatever that has to do with anything. So, I came over to Mom's today and checked my LJ/myspace totally tramatised by what I might have written last night. Gopher and I were in and out of a blackout drunk and I knew at some point I got on a computer. I read what I wrote and it makes no fucking sense to anyone but me! There is no way anyone would get it....whew. I did not know if I had made a death threat or something horrid. I deleted it just because it was retarded and does not have anything to do with reality. I have been crying this morning because I was reading this book that I really do not need to read. It is called ""How We Die"" By Sherwin B. Nuland. If you want to freak out about death then read this book! It is awful. It is written for nurses and doctors to know what actually happens in detail to the physical body. I read the chapter about heart failure which applies to me and might be the way I end up dieing if some accident doesn't get me. It was terrible and scared the shit out of me. Basicly I get to drown in my own organs filled with fluid and gasp for my last breaths painfully. Fucking shit. I am mad at the guy who wrote this crap. Yeah, I can stop all my bad habits and live this healthy lifestyle and I still will never get better. Speaking of I have not had a ciggarette today, have none and Gopher took off with the half pack which will be gone by the time he gets off work. My car will probably run out of gas. We have no food AT ALL. I am so broke and it scares me...what are we going to do? Rent is due today...don't have it. This temporary lay off at work is killing me and then to top it off with a big bloody cherry, my last 5 appointments have stood me up! FUCK! Why is shit so bad right now? And we are so depressed the temptation to stay fucked up is an everyday battle. We are both so sick of being wasted, our bodies are sick and our minds cloudy...I wish I had the same drive to panhandle for gas or groceries that I do for a bottle. I always make sure I have enough of everything on the weekend for my kids but beyond that, fuck it. suffer,suffer,suffer. And I have friends who are doing things in their lives, important things, artistic things and I am not doing anything but living half measures. Why when we finally get a home we get so goddamn depressed that we just stay all fucked up and try to ruin it all? What the hell is going on here? We woke up and both felt like we did something really bad. I think everyone was annoyed with us last night and I recall feeling cast out like being around some High School clique. I was mad cause I could not even compose myself to act normal. Noone was out in the open rude, they just did not want to play me and Gopher's reindeer games and hell I don't blame anyone for not wanting to go there! I hate being the drunk idiot. And I NEVER drive intoxicated but I had to haul ass out of there before I was in complete blackout and did something real bad...who knows what but I just knew to go. The dogs tore my whole house apart while we were out...all the house cleaning we did is now gone. Whine,whine,whine...I hate even listening to my shit. The screwed up thing is that ONE thing would fix it ALL! MONEY. I am sure there are some underlieing other problems or reasons like our mental sickness, depression and addictions but on the real side of things money would make it all better. And I will argue anyone to death about it. Money does bring happiness. Really. If I could have a big old steak and sit in my livingroom eating it while watching my cable or rented movies then forget getting fucked up. Not much to ask for sobriety. And it is not a lack of work that has hurt us...we both try hard. It has truely been luck and I am not feeling sorry for myself when saying that. Okay...shut up now me. Bite me."

"event","I hate Becky, the old lady next door. Here we are enjoying our weekend project (project de-trash) having a good productive start and here she comes...The bitch from next door. You really have to see this work of art woman. She has no hair and is petite, wears a bandana, nothing or a big 80's wig, she is about 90 years old and spits bullets. I thought she was the nicest little old woman when I moved in but she is Satan's mistress...I kindof like her cause she is so mean! Anyway,
 she starts yelling at me about my friend's rental application and yelling at me not to send anyone else over to her house...but she is not the landlord, she only works for the landlord and the actual landlord instructed me to point anyone interested in renting to Becky. But instead of argueing I say okay, I will tell my friend that they need more information. Whatever. So back to my project and bang,bang,bang! Becky at the door again!!! Bitching me out cause some people I do not know inquired about the apartments...probably the landlord sent them to her, I mean goddamn she works for the landlord! But she is yelling at me about it, in my face, in frount of my kids so, my patience and ability to hold my tounge died and I told her "" look I really don't care about the management of these apartments, it is not my job and I don't give a good goddamn!"" I slam the door....oh fucking hell the can of worms I opened. Bad mistake. Becky begins raising all kinds of hell all day and calls the landlord yelling every lie she can make up. I can hear her yelling through the walls all day long. Then my lesbian buddies show up and we cook a big meal,play with the kids and the dogs, drink a little and BANG,BANG,BANG!!! It is Becky at the door, she screams for us to quiet down! Did not know we were being loud and she told us just the other day that we could play our music as loud as we want that it doesn't bother her, but there was no music this time just kids running and playing, and the casual laughter of us adults...believe me it was very relaxed compared to our usual get togethers. But we are nice and tell her we will quiet down. We put the kids to bed and we start telling jokes laughing and drinking...still mundane. My love brings out this glow in the dark skeleton glass thingy he got at the flea market and puts batteries in it for the first time and we all went ""WOW!"" when he turned it on like some glazed eyed hippies or something stupid...BANG,BANG,BANG!!! I assume it is Becky and I do not want to hear her shrill voice again so Gopher answers the door. ""Police step outside"" and the dog starts barking, so knowing I am the most sober one I push Gopher out of the way and step outside thinking 'great, here I go to jail for nothing'both cops pull their guns on me and my dog...so I am standing there at gunpoint saying calmly ""can someone please get the dog?""and I told them that he is just a puppy and does not bite...finally one of my idiot pals pull the dog out from under my legs. One of the cops was freaking out, the other one seemed embarassed kinda stayed quiet and listened to me objectively (he was the one actually doing his job!) The freaking out cop yelled that basicly the reason they are there is because of 2 noise complaints, that they don't care about all our dope we have inside but that since a fellow officer just died everyone on the force has been parinoid. Okay, no problem. I calm him down and explain that we were just talking and laughing and had all just said ""WOW"" real loud about this dumb skeleton thing and showed it to the officers, that there was no dope, kids are in bed and all we are doing is hanging out, that the lady next door has looked for a reason to get us in trouble with the landlord all day. I promise we will be quiet and I ask them to explain the law of when cops get called to your house when they can enter and when they can arrest or search you etc... so we start a conversation...they calmed down and I am sure Becky was listening just pissy that they were talking to me instead of raiding us and carting our dead corpses off. I feel a little safer in my home now because I know the law. This morning, I take the dogs out to pee and there is Becky slamming doors and screaming at the top of her lungs about all the hell she has put up with from us and how she wants us evicted, she was, I assume, on the phone with the landlord. I thought for a sec about calling the police and making a noise complaint...hehe. But I do not involve the police in my business, it would have been cute like some domestic shit on COPS. I have just ignored her. I really don't know what to do about it. We really like the apartment. I don't know what our rights are. The landlord and us have never had a bad word. We are payed up on rent...but it is due again on Tuesday and I am reluctant to pay if we are just going to get evicted. I am not going to get depressed though it would be easy to. We have actually been fairly innocent in this...so I just have to trust that justice and fate will prevail in time. I really hope Becky quits harassing us. Kill her with kindness and not loose my composure I guess...but I am not going out of my damn way to run into her. Kids are playing in the sprinkler...it is a nice day. I feel better getting that off my mind. Anyone have any suggestions? I mean I am afraid that she will keep calling the police for no reason and coming over and harassing my family. I do not want to live under her thumb."

- The World Trade Center
- Worldwide sympathy for America
- Osama Bin Laden
- Clinton's budget surplus
- Clinton's cheap gas ($1.15 average over 8 years ago)
- Iraq
- Iran
- North Korea
- and now New Orleans

Granted it's not Bush's fault on New Orleans, it is a natural disaster. However, there was not enough helicopters to repair breeched levees and rescue trapped people. Nor not nearly enough LA National Guards to prevent looting, patrol, or supply the people with rescue efforts. So where are all helicopters and National Guards? On a blind fool mission in Iraq. Bush is the boy who cried war, and in return Rumsfield claims there isn't enough regular troops in Iraq so more National Guards are sent to a war that shouldn't have been started let alone still be going on. 

Bush-era neglect of our national infrastructure, combined with runaway global warming.. but yet more rain forests get cut down so we can graze cattle and have yet another Wal-Mart thats ten minutes from the last one. The flooding was not a result of heavy rains. It is a result of a weak levee -- one that was in mid-repair when the storm hit. And that levee, which has held back floodwaters for time beyond memory, collapsed for one simple reason: Bush refused to fix it last summer, when local officials were begging him to do so. Instead, he diverted those funds to the war effort.
So while we pump our gas today and the next few days, we can thank Bush who is JUST NOW stopping his hard work with his vacation. Now if all of those yellow ribbon magnets could make a difference now."

"event","I have a knot on my head, a broken toe...I hurt all over. Woke up half naked. Apparently I kissed two people, molested my friend, had to be wrestled to the floor, knocked a picture off the wall, text messaged someone asking for blood and spilt a new jug of wine on the floor. I think I had a good time. Me and Gopher even inspired our friend to write a poem last night:

The Gruesome Twosome

Blood wash
A filmy veneer
Punctuated by great splashes

Alcohol haze
Writ of heinous corpus
Freedom an illusion, elusive

Tragedy
Raging against the heartbeat
Mourning survival

Comedy
Massaging absurdity
Innocence intact

Perversion
Welcome in my bed
Locked from my spirit

I love them both.
Sabine.  


and here is what another pal said:
I'll be over tonight with a 55 gallon drum of Mad Dog 20/20, an ice cream cone, more glow sticks, & a super-soaker full of baby oil.  


I also woke up with a glow stick in my underware."

"event","I know I need to write this blog but I have been putting it off for a long while. Tonight I could not sleep despite nerve pills and dog snuggles. If it was not the fear of the imaginary things that might come haunting out of the fireplace than it was the parinoid thoughts of crackheads breaking in with guns. Fucking mind. I suppose my brain is pretty healthy considering the life I have lived so far. I do not mean to make what I write here a self pity story, what I need to do is go back and remember...something I am so afraid to do. Will I break all connection with reality if I do remember? I dearly hope not but it is a chance I know I must take. I have thought nothing about what I must say except only this introduction...the rest is imprinted in my heart's darkest corner. It has been over three years since my son's passing into death and it is finally time to challenge the demons that taunt my dreams...time to cleanse my night terrors away. John was angry because I told him I wanted to leave tonight and come write this but he was half asleep...maybey he will forgive me when he reads it and knows I am not just flirting on here. I need to turn this into a recollection of my past and an insight into my future instead of just a meat market game...even though that is so fun! Excuse my poor spelling and grammer mistakes I cheated in all my college english classes (thanks for seeing me through Sabine!) Here we go:

     So, I guess I will begin with a little history about myself and the situation. In a nutshell, there are many crazy unbelieveable stories about my life that will need to be told another time as my life story could fill several novels. My therapist told me once that I have experienced things that many 100 year olds have never experienced in their combined lifetimes. Some very brief examples include; being in a nut ward at 13 years of age, teenage LSD salesperson, survivor of much sexual and mental abuse, town drunk (over 30 public intoxication charges as a juvenile), teen hooker, lived in a haunted house or was it my head?, my father killed all my pets, school punching bag till I learned to fight, slut, lesbian 3 year relationship, dropped out of school and hit the road, homeless at 15, street living, raped by the Dominos delivery driver, beat up by 20 people, married a woman in a chrch, joined a vampyre cult, practiced Voodoo in a New Orleans squat while on the road for a while, my score board of women I slept with in one year (over 45) because I was cheated on, Uncle's lover dies of AIDS, Voodoo priest vampyre seduction, went to pick up friend for school and he was dead, the evil witch that drank my blood and drained me for months while captive in her hell, lover commits suicide, favorite grandpa dies on my birthday, found a dead body in the woods while running from the cops...took cops back and it was gone, major crime/ gang related...won't go into details but should have grown old in prison, ran from city to city, 6 treatment centers for addictions, 6 years sober in A.A. , married a country boy, had 2 children with him and played Betty Homemaker...found I am very domestically disabled, cult therapy for a year, went to the psych ward claiming to be a vampire, 20 bucks will get a con artist across the country and back, college student, business owner (head shop), $$$ and then lost it all on a bad gamble, is she bi-polar or Borderline or scitzophrenic?, and met my insane boytoy went on a 3 month binge and wrote him in jail for 8 months...we are like Sid and Nancy...noone ever approved of us, they all think we are evil...some said to evil to be parents....they did not know us inside the insanity there was a soundness of love, a blanket of strength we held to for dear life from the moment we found out.

    the beginning of the end

   So, we went to that pro-life clinic where you can get the free pregnancy test the one that show you dead babies in trash can movies if you menchion abortion...those assholes that throw ketchup covered dolls at women as they arrive at the abortion clinic. Well, the old lady preached Jesus in this small room to me as John paced the hall. I had thrown up the previous night's Vodka and was only a couple of days late. Really we were kinda bored and I just thought I would argue with someone about God for entertainment, maybey scare the hell out of my lover as I am kindof sadistic like that. So, I wait and expect it to be over soon to head for the nearest liquor store...John is ushered in then another woman comes in with a little pink pair of mittens, some baby shampoo and a washcloth wrapped in a bag with a pretty bow and she sings ""Congratulations!""

   OH FUCK! We leave even though they wanted to talk to us. John wanted an abortion but I already knew I would not be able to have one because for me it is not right. We began the freak out pregnancy from hell...I got a job at an Adult Video store working crazy hours, John went through an early midlife crisis. He had affairs with several women, even found a naked prostitute on my livingroom floor one morning when I was 8 months pregnant, John could not stand to stay sober....his life was over so he felt...I was trying to stay sober and healthy but could not give up ciggs. I tried to drink with John and one of his sluts one night but puked everywhere...they ignored me. I felt sorry for myself...I went and gave my ex- hubby head and did not tell John for a long time just to have my own secret for revenge. We weren't even getting ready for a baby we were just freaking out and playing games...it was so immature. Since I had already had 2 children I began to get serious toward the end and put together a nursery out of hand me downs. Our relatives who hated the fact of the pregnancy finally statred to come around and pitched in with new gifts for our baby. 

    333 and the demon in the ultrasound

John and I are both spooky people but John is more skeptical about most things of the paranormal than I am. We began to see the numbers 333 everywhere, everyday without fail. I woke at night at 3;33, addresses we were supposed to go said 333, license plates and signs said 333, phone numbers people gave us said 333, the power would go out the clock would say 3:33 upon restoration, our reciepts always said $3.33, it was everywhere following us and we were really begining to notice that it had to be beyond this world! And that it must have something to do with my pregnancy. We decided to name our baby after the boy in the movie  ""the Omen"", Damien. on the day of my last ultrasound John grabbed a tape so the doctor could tape it for us, we were running late and John did not pay attention to what tape he grabbed. We got home to watch it and we popped it in the VCR...the music for ""the Omen"" began to play, a shadow of the boy came on then the ultrasound started...we thought that was freaky...but then we watched and in the middle of the ultrasound there appeared this face with sharp features and ram horns on his head, he turned slowly and looked strait at us grinning an evil grin...we both gasped and rewound the tape over and over hopeing we were just seeing shapes in the ultrasound. We called family and friends to come see it, they all saw it as well. Everyone was talking about the demon in our son's ultrasound. I even sent a letter to a psychic hopeing she could help us figure out why this demon was looking at us in our son's ultrasound. I took it as a sign that I had better give him another name instead of Damien as Damien means demon! So I named him Gabriel along with John. Gabriel was an angel with a dark side but also one of God's favorites so we felt comfortable with it. Give him an angel's name and at least we would stay away from demons! Hell, it was crazy...

His life Dec 10 to Feb 3

   He had spiked dark hair and big black eyes, I had never seen a baby with eyes so blue that they were black! He had a knowlage in his face, he looked like an old soul in a baby body. The love in his eyes for John and I was tremendous. I knew every need he had automaticly, like I read his mind, he almost never cried he would just snort quietly when he wanted my breast or a dry diaper. When John held him he would open his eyes wide and try to chomp at John's chest or neck. Every waking hour me and John were focused on Gabriel's every need. We named Him Mark Gabriel Ware Mclain. The Mark part was because my father was upstairs in the hospital in ICU because he had ran head on into a semi truck on purpose trying to commit suicide and lived (crippled and brain damaged) two weeks prior to Gabriel's birth. The Ware part was John's middle name. We video taped everything, even his homecoming. Everyday was beautiful and I could not wait to wake every morning to love my baby. My other children fell in love with Gabriel right away...they helped with taking care of him, they were so proud to have a little brother! Gabriel had a cherub on the wall above his changeing table he would look at and get so excited he would kick and punch...I would say ""Gabriel do you miss your friends?"" We took Gabriel to the doctor for his shots and there was a little baby mouse asleep beside our car when we went in the doctors office. We had the kids with us and we all looked at the mouse. When we came out of the doctor's the mouse was dead.  I thought it was signifigant but did not know how. John got offered a job up north to tile a restraunt, it was good money so he took it. He was only supposed to be gone 3 days. Gabriel was 6 1/2 weeks old. I was sad when John left and He called me constantly. His asshole boss did not give him shit to live on while up there and they were gone 9 days. His boss even would not let me call when Gabriel had a cough and I took him to the doctor. The doctor said that Gabriel had a mild cold and would be fine, I had a cold also and was on antibiotics and cough medicine. I had Gabriel and the kids pictures taken at Wal Mart. John came home and I was so excited I remember feeling guilty because I let Gabriel swing a bit to much while cleaning the house to make it all perfect for John. John got in at 3 a.m. and his asshole boss...by the way this guys name is EDDIE HILL...(our mortal enemy now) from Athens Alabama...He would not bring John home and made me and the baby get out in the cold to meet him, then he did not pay John for the job. We were so happy to be together as a family we did not care about the money...we went home and John cuddled with Gabriel, Gabriel always kicked and wiggled when He heard his daddy talk! I had some pork chops and when I pulled them out of the fridge to cook I noticed the package said $3.33 and showed it to John. We ate and John and Gabriel almost fell asleep on the sofa...I was afraid they would roll off so I woke them and told them to come to bed. We snuggled in John behind me like a spoon and Gabriel on the other side of me. All my children always slept in the bed with me since I breast fed or that is where they ended up by morning. I fed Gabriel and changed him, John fell asleep a moment before us and I remember looking in Gabriel's eyes, He seemed to say ""I love you"" with his eyes and I said out loud ""I love you too"" and put him next to my breast to sleep. It was around noon perhaps when we dosed off....I recall a shrill cry in the night and I remember vaugely putting my breast in Gabriel's mouth. We slept deeply. I woke up and it was dark in the room, I tried to put my breast back in Gabriel's mouth to awaken him, his lips would not move and I thought he must be sleeping really well. Then I reached down and felt his hand...it was tight in a fist and I could not open it, just then the cold temperature of his body hit me like a slap to the face, he was like ice, I touched his lips and mouth and face and he would not move. I shot up and put my hands on his belly which was ice cold shaking him gently...I could not see him it was pitch dark. I screamed but no sound came out then it finally did which was probably a second but it seems like a space of time ""Turn on The light Gabriel's dead!"" ""Gabriel's dead!"" My scream was so loud...I thought John would turn on the light and I would see only my child in a deep sleep, cold from the night, a false scare...the light came on and my and I will never be able to forget what I saw. My child, my son as white as this screen, dried blood on his nose and dead...really dead....my hands were on his chest and I screamed a jolt of electricity it felt like went through my hands, up my arms and out the top of my skull, time froze, I was insanely shocked and cold and could not grasp this...there is no explanation...one's heart is fragile enough when awakening but to feel such horror in the dark and see such horror and be in so much horror...time freezes, every belief about life, God and Man left me at that second when the jolt went through my hands arms and head....I screamed for John to call 911, I had some hope, I know C.P.R. so I began it. John  was trying to call 911 and talk to them while wailing in loud screams NO! NO! hitting every wall in the hall and house...I was trying to think...okay I can save him....I tryed everything I knew franticly, I would save him I kept telling myself, the ER person on the phone kept trying to give me instructions, sweep his mouth, hit his back if anything is in his throat, breath, pushes on his ribcage not under as you would an adult...I was thinking mechanically, the ambulance was lost...I thought I heard a breath, no, a lung inflated but then did not deflate, it made a noise, he was so cold, I began cussing at the er guy on the phone, No there is no goddamn pool at our apartments where the fuck are you guys???!!!!focus, lung inflated, push chest again....John shut the fuck up and help me, here tell this dumbass where we are! Go outside and chase down the ambulance, blow again, try mouth sweep again, chest,....he is so cold, dammit breath!!!! breath baby don't leave mommy please don't leave us! blow...chest compressions....the paramedics rush in...I see the grey haired man shake his head at the female paramedic as they put this breathing bag on Gabriel and pump it, they run with him in their arms to the loud ambulance...some man outside asks what is happening...I say ""our baby is not breathing"" and I get up frount in the ambulance. John grabs Gabriel's pacifier and putts it in his pocket for when Gabriel wakes up and follows the ambulance on it's tail. I am trying to crawl in the back seat watching the paramedics shake their heads as they try to make him breathe..I am calling mom on the cell...I do not know why she won't answer at work I am screaming in the phone ""Gabriel's dead"" Gabriel's dead!""  I did not know it was 7 p.m. I thought it was 7 a.m. the sirens are so loud, wow I am in an ambulance what am I doing here? my baby my baby! tears trickle down but do not come I am frozen with time...it is like a movie so intense I am lost...they rush him in and try to push us back...nurses and doctors they push us back they inject him they shock his little chest and his body rises they do all kinds of things. Then I hear the doctor say ""call it"" and he walks past us not even looking in our eyes and says ""sorry"" and keeps walking. John hits the glass and starts wailing at the top of his lungs and I am franticly screaming for them to try more! they rush us away from the room into a room with a detective who asks us questions...we tell him what happened and he says ""well, you guys should never let andinfant sleep in the same bed with you"" ignorant fucker. they finally let us back in the room and I sit down and two nurses are foot printing and hand printing Gabriel...they have cleaned him up and wrapped him in a blanket with little feet on it. They put his corpse in my arms. where is my mom? mom and my sister show up and my sister wails like John, her innocent face tainted now by the sight of death. I am screaming ""mommy help me my baby? what is happening Mommy! Mommy!"" We held him forever. I looked in his eyes and opened them wide to see if ""Gabriel"" was still in this body....his eyes were grey not the familiar blue/black. His chest turned into blue spots and he got so stiff. I held him so close and kissed him. My breasts flowed with milk, my shirt and top of my pants were soaked...my body trying to nourish my dead baby. A mother's milk lets down at the sight of her baby. tears flowed like thin water down my cheeks and were not in drops but just a constant stream of sad salty water to my chin and down....John's face did the same...John's mother and aunt were there...his aunt gave us $40...his mom looked at me like I killed Gabriel somehow. It made me afraid I had. We walked out of that ER with a bag that had a small cherub on it that said underneath ""remember me"" inside were Gabriel's foot and hand prints, his pacifier John had carried in his pocket behind the ambulance and Gabriel's socks. I thought his feet might get cold and was mad that they gave us his socks. The bag smelled like death. there was his empty car seat in the car behind us all the way home. At home his last diaper I changed urine soaked was still on the changeing table, the jacket he had on earlier, the swing was empty. I remembered his first tub bath he had two days prior because his cord had fallen off and the kids helped me Gabriel smiled for the first time then.

the aftermath

    Eddie Hill fired John because He did not want to give him time off for the funeral, He never payed him what he owed him and what could he pay for taking the last 9 days of Gabriel's time here on earth away from John? Eddie Hill told John in frount of me, "" babies die everyday, I found a replacement for you, now go on"" time still was frozen, friends showed up pushing beer and food in our mouths. All we could do was sit still with tears constantly streaming down our faces, people shoved food, beer, pills in our faces, mom and my sister ceaned, so much food was there, I could not really hear what anyone was saying. John noticed the microwave said 3:33 a.m. he yelled outloud. people dresseed us and bathed us and fed us and gave us intoxicants...we could not do anything but cry and sit looking in the distance. Our bodies shut down because of shock. a week past because of the autopsy it took so long...we picked out red roses and the best coffin with cherubs, the wake and funeral were a blurrr, my other kids were there, my daughter tried to wake Gabriel. The funeral director let us hold him but told us to be careful because he would fall apart, the autopsy scar was stitched like he was a cheap doll or a shoe. He was limp not stiff anymore...lifelike. I wondered if they glued his eyes shut. Dad came to the funeral in a wheel chair, I don't know who was there but I think it was a bunch of people. my sister had a black dress at the grave side I recall, I stood as they lowered him into the earth at the head of the coffin, the cold wind stung my chapped cheeks that bled from the weeks constant tears...I did not know one could cry till their face bled. mom got us gothic clothes to wear, I had to bind my breasts to stop the milk but my funeral dress got wet anyway. Everyone left. my son had helped shovel the dirt with an angry grief look on his 4 year old face. they took photos of him dead. I burried him in a striped prison looking jumper with a blanket that was made for him. that afternoon Darrel at Wicked Tattoos closed his shop to take care of only us...we got memorial tattoos on our backs and some piercings for a bargain price...the begining of my cherub tat collection. mom took us in for a while as we were still unable to work or take physical care of ourselves.

reconstruction

   they call it reconstruction when a person gets their life back on track after a death of a loved one. It is statisticaly shown that it takes 2 years to become reconstructed after the death of a child...it is less with the death of a spouse or parent. The death of a child is supposed to be the hardest thing to emotionally experience in life. And the guilt. We finally got the autopsy last year that put away my fears that I might have suffocated him against my body. He died of SIDS- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. It happens to one of every 1000 births in the U.S.A. more in some countrys. More males born in winter months die of SIDS. Gabriel was healthy otherwise...we did everything right. As far as getting our lives back on track....well, we have both been to the mental ward, taken many hard drugs, drank and avoided the reality of this life. Only recently do things seem to be close to okay again. We lost it all over this, we became homeless, John did jail time twice, I have had halucinations, we have both been very delusional...it has been a long hard road out of hell. I have my other two children to live for but I admire John's strength for being able to continue life with Gabriel having been his only son by blood. Gabriel looked just like John. We both grieve in separate ways. Another statistic is that 90% of all couples who lose a child to death break up. 90%!!! yet here we are still together. I hope to have another baby but it would never replace Gabriel. He was special, not ment for this world...and honestly I could never really see him growing up, neither could John...it was strange how everything happened...all the signs like the mouse and we still see 333 every single day! We have had other strange things happen too. The angel Gabriel rules the winter months the same time Gabriel lived. The angel Gabriel rules the cherubs and takes the breath of babies. There is some confusion in the bible as to weather Gabriel was the father of christ. 333 in the tree of life numericaly means a child who is brought into the world to die an infant to bring a message. The angel Gabriel was the messenger of God. My Gabriel had black eyes and looked longingly at his cherub picture.... there are lots of babies that die and I don't know if mine was special...I like to believe He was."

Blonde hair, perky tits, musicianship
Lol- you're as shallow as a puddle
And just as muddy
Fifty dollar stockings won't disguise
Bony Praying Mantis legs
You can stroke the ivories 
And paid great sums for such
But truly, you must admit
You actually suck cocks for a buck
And how talented are you?
With your early 20's wisdom
Your delicate immune system
Your Ritalin and your Valium
Your pasty breast swells with pride
As you spew venom dressed up as advice
I know you. You don't realize
Where I have witnessed your lies
You call yourself careful
Authentic, ethical and discreet
But a slug trail of your manipulation
Belies your thin, brittle veneer
Your depth a deceit.

Pretentious whore
Shut your flapping mouth
You know not what you say
Nor the cards I have to play.

Do not fuck with suicidal BPDs
Yes, our poetry is awful
But once you've aroused our wrath
Legions shall appear
And bleed you dry and hollow.

Not to worry, dry-skinned paper doll;
Louis Vuitton will keep you after all.

Dad is a suicidal emotionally vacant shell of a man crippled by his only suicide attempt when he stalked a semi truck turned the family mini van around a half mile in frount of it and ran full speed ahead with seatbelt and headlights off head on into it. His mental, sexual and physical abuse still haunts my thoughts and behaviors though I try like hell to fight it. And he sits in south end pretty as you please with his gold digger internet bride bitch from hell who turned him against us girls...oh well fuck her and fuck him. Mom is so wrapped around my younger sister's finger that she is oblivious! Recovered from dad's abuse, christian, and in denial that she ever raised me mom living in a glass house with a teenage angst ruler as her God instead of Dad...mom always needs someone to use her. But it is okay, it is a world of peace and nothing rocks the boat over at mom and little sissy's.... it is as if they have lived in some eternal floaty nirvana perfected from the world and all it's ugliness that is unless me and my punk BF, unruley kids and big clumbsy dog show up to spoil their day...haha! And little sissy likes me when she is wanting to be a bad girl sometimes and talk about sex, drugs and vodka...and dad likes me when I am trying to help him get my little sissy to go somewhere cause he has a sick little fucked up crush on her and cannot keep his eyes off her young body like he could not keep his eyes off mine or my daughter's...and mom likes me sometimes when I am talking about positive things or man hateing and not begging for something and my other sissy is way far away in a world I am jealous as fuck over....living an artistic lesbian commune hippy life....really I have nothing bad to say about that except I need her and she is not always around to talk to....she got better and got out! Good for her....don't look back....hell, I wouldn't! I just miss things sometimes when I think about how it was before we all grew up, before we all knew how fucked up we all were, not the bad times but the good like when we all sat around the dinner table and laughed for a while....before someone pissed dad off or got distracted....those few moments frozen in time and petrified there forever when the sickness consumed us all and before we got the diagnosis that made us realise we had to find a cure....sometimes I still feel sick.

And both my lover and I are extreamly bad judges of character. You would think all of my time on the street I would be able to detect a crackhead with a game but it is so hard to be mean without seeming prejudice. That is another story I really don't feel like getting on the topic as our lives are moving away from that underdog chaos and taking an artistic turn for the better. We moved some things into our house today, cleaned and it looks swell! We stayed until dark just decorateing and playing...the kids put wings on Fonzy (the dog) and he ran in circles...ha! it was hilarious. The kids are just as excited as we are. They cleaned, carried toys in their rooms  and swept the porch and sidewalk. Gopher hung some of our gothic shit up to make it feel like ours...and by night we were all sitting in the livingroom with candles on the fireplace mantle just content. This is our first home in 2 years and our first home alone without roommates in even longer...it feels like home. I am greatful to my friend Sabine for helping us with this dream. I love you Sabine! We are at mom's gotta go cook dinner.

It really hurts to be with someone you love but cannot trust. I am very discouraged. I wish I was with someone who shared everything with me and I could share everything with them....but for some reason it is not in the cards for me. I love my man so deeply but I am never enough for him it seems. I don't want anyone to gang up with me against my love, it is not that I am talking bad about him and fellas eating my pussy will not make it better so fuck off with the sex bullshit. I just don't understand his privacy and secrets that usually end up hurting me. It all makes me feel very small and worthless to him. Everything I have ever done is for revenge. I am tired of playing Sid and Nancy and I am ready to just feel at home with my love. He is all I ever wanted but so hard to understand. I want the drama to stop and all the sluts and backstabbing associates who seek our demise to die...why don't they just kill their pathetic selves and leave my family the fuck alone. We have something beautiful and so many others want it...selfish dumbasses. and we are to weak to resist damn temptations they wave at us. How have we lasted 6 years with so much shit in our way? I am depressed tonight and I have been focusing on work and other people's problems so much that I forget sometimes how fucked up everything is....which is good...I suppose but I also forget myself. Have you ever loved so deeply that you felt you would die if it was ever lost? What form of hell and heaven combined in a clusterfuck is this relationship? My boy is all so pretty and I just wish I could keep him in a little box but then he would not be so beautiful. Oh why do I love the wild ones...always have. And how do they find me? I feel ravenous and protective but it has gotten me in so much trouble before. When will I just accept him without all these other lovers and people of his hurting my soul so hardcore? I guess maybey when he lets me have my own friends and lovers....you know that saying what is good for the goose is good for the gander....but dammit I want to be everthing to him so bad. And I really don't want my own collection of people. I guess? I don't know. I hate to be older today....back when I was prettier I would just rip everyone's heart out and at least feel justified but the years are taking my chances away. Blood drys quicker and is less justifying to me. I only crave for my Gopher, John, ""Gabriel"" my love, my boytoy,my lover with his secrets, addictions and his shitty friends I love all of him all so much it hurts. Please let me have this."

"event","Dammit! I had this appointment with this dumbass that played Everquest for two hours after I got there....ergh!!!! I think I will join Everquest just so I can kick his ass in it! I am not into video games....waste of fucking time....but so is myspace I suppose. I am spending the night at my friend's tonight and staying up all night to make sure everyone gets up for work and has laundry done etc....guess what? I almost died last night! For real! We were at the motel and we had gone out drinking at the Vampire meet-up that met at Kaffeeklatch prior. So my lover went off with some guy that lured him to another part of the hotel with a handful of pills...of which he did not get any and someone else set the room on fire while I slept! I was awakened by the maintenance people pulling me out of the smoke filled room! So, I trew all our shit in the car and gave this homeless woman who I had given shoes to the other day our room and the key and we got the hell out!!! Come to find out it was all because My love owed some druglord $5.00! We get our apartment tommarrow and I am sooooo happy to be on our way out of hell. Glad to be alive tonight!"

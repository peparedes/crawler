Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary to the Treasury of Reagan\'s Administration, has warned his countrymen that the American government is planning an attack on it\'s own people (a la Sept 11) in order to start war with Iran. (http://en.rian.ru/world/20070720/69340886.html)

If you continue to believe that you are living in a democracy, if you continue to believe the mainstream news media, if you continue to turn a blind eye when there is so much physical factual evidence of a great conspiracy taking over your country, then it is YOUR FAULT and your fault alone that America will turn into a police state. Say goodbye to your so-called \'freedoms\' which you have already mostly lost, say goodbye to your rights, say goodbye to your friends and family because, according to a new Executive Order released July 17th, any person who interferes with the government\'s Iraq agenda, can and will have any and all assets withheld by the government. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070717-3.html)

What that means, is dissent is no longer allowed in America. YOU HAVE ALL LOST YOUR FREEDOMS.

If you don\'t believe the credibility of the warning, let me tell you this as well: Operation Noble Eagle is deploying troops into the nation\'s capital to \""defend the homeland.\"" (http://www.wesh.com/news/13949580/detail.html).

AND

An \'anonymous\' trader has bet that the stock market will suffer a huge loss, something that could only be brought about by another September 11th, and that it will happen before September 21st of this year. (http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2007/270807_market_crash.htm) If you haven\'t cared enough to read up on 9/11 you wouldn\'t have read that hundreds of put options were placed on American Airlines and United Airlines, an unprecedented move that caused an anonymous trader billions of dollars in profits. A put option is essentially a bet that a certain stock will fall.

The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far refused to reveal who stands to profit from 9/11 and who will profit from this coming attack. If there is a threat to national security, why wouldn\'t it be revealed who is predicting this threat? Why? Because the SEC is a government agency.

It took me all of 10 minutes to find all the information above. All I had to do was a quick Google search. ALL I HAD TO DO, WAS CARE ABOUT THE WORLD.

ANYONE WHO IGNORES THIS THREAT IS INVITING THOSE IN POWER TO STRIP US ALL OF OUR RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.

This does NOT just affect Americans. This affects the entire world.

WAKE UP. PLEASE."

"event","it's 9.34 on a sunday night and i find myself soooooooooooo boooooooooooooooooooored.

let's recap: i've taken a week off work so i can do art. a great kick-off to the week, we went to see nuit blanche last night, an <i>all night contemporary art thing</i> as the ads, attempting wit, described. i saw some cool stuff, mostly a lot of crap and was up really late. we rolled into bed around 4 am. of course, i didn't plan on getting up at any early hour today, and was eating my delicious breakfast sometime between 1 and 3. after realising that after todd showered, i would have to, i also realised there would be absolutely no time for me to make it to any curry's before 5, the time they all - in our apparent non-religious society that still observes the ""good sunday"" of christ's rule - like any other store, close. that's alright, said i, i can stew on ideas and research and write the things i'm going to do. 

i forgot that i did that yesterday. 

todd was on his way to a department meeting and drinks afterwards (meeting starting at 4) and has yet to return. an unprecedented bout of laziness and procrastination has left me, 6 hours after showering and getting dressed, still on the couch, the living room in the same state of mess and only one additional paragraph on the children's story i started yesterday. 

again, i am now sooooooooooooooooooooo booooooooooooooooooooooored. 

i miss my boy. i wish he had some sort of phone or tracking device or bat signal so i could get in touch with him, whine about my boredom and join him to fill my now-6-hour-long craving for chicken wings and a pint and a nice sit-down in a pub. i expect him to walk in any minute, stumbling from his company-paid drunk. but i've been expecting him back all day. 

in all fairness, i can't start painting until i have canvass and brushes, and painting is the main thing i'll be doing this week. that is just a really easy excuse to procrastinate, however, since i could have drawn out my characters for the book, or started sketching out the pages. or, hell, i could have cleaned a little more. i am currently in the middle of doing a load of laundry - my favourite chore as you can be productive while sitting on our ass and letting the machines do all the work. i also cleaned out half the recycling, but was too afraid of cleaning the rest out due to the constant finding of pee and poop and the realisation that there very well could be mice hiding in any one of the boxes i was picking up. the kittens snoozing in the corner, so valiantly protecting me, did nothing to calm this fear. so i snorgled the kittens a little, took some pictures of them and read a chapter or two of this lame book i randomly decided to read the other day. oh, right, and i'm updating this only to waste more time. and because i want to read something new when i go to my friends page, which i have a hundred times today. 

though now, i suppose, this is done, as i'm out of whining and clearly have nothing of importance to write. 

more in a few months, i suppose

the love and the hugs

"event","hey everybody, i thought you might want to check out the letter i wrote to our dear ""prime minister.""

<lj-cut text=""Well done, Mr. Harper!"">

Mr. Harper,

I am writing to you because of your stance on the current crisis in
Lebanon. I am writing to you, as a proud Canadian, because your stance
on the war does not reflect that of your country or her citizens. I am
writing to you, Mr. Harper, because you have made me feel ashamed of
our great country, ashamed of how the world must see us now.

In a statement you made on the bombing of the UN post in Southern
Lebanon, you wondered why ""it remained manned in what is now, more or
less, a war."" Why was the UN in Lebanon, Mr. Harper? They were acting
as observers, and acting as peace-keepers in the region. They were
doing what all of us patriotic Canadians understand and defend. They
were doing what we should be doing right now, Mr. Harper. And make no
mistake, Stephen, this is a war. It may be unjust and it may be akin
to genocide, but it is indeed a war.

In the same statement, you defend the Israeli Prime Minister. You
state that the Israeli government has been co-operating to evacuate
our dear citizens from the country. While it is great we were so quick
to step in and save our own, so what? What of the citizens of Lebanon,
Mr. Harper? What of the dead children in the streets? What of the
hospitals and schools, the roads and bridges and airports that now
stand in rubble? What of the refugees, now without homes or anywhere
to go? What of the now-motherless children? Will you fly your plane in
to save them, Mr. Harper? Will your photographer catch that on film,
Stephen?

You say also, Mr. Harper, that you ""doubt"" the attack on the UN post
was deliberate. I would like to know what evidence you cite for your
doubt, Mr. Harper. The UN has made comments that all that day they had
seen rockets getting closer to their post. That 21 strikes hit within
300 metres of the base, and 12 artillery rounds fell within 100
metres. That there had been at least six (6) seperate warnings made to
the Israeli army by a senior Irish soldier that the attacks were too
close to the base and that ""lives would be lost."" And yet, they
continued to fire, and you continue to turn a blind eye.

I stated that this is a war. Six hundred dead Lebanese would testify
to that. This is not another ""War"" on ""Terrorism"", Mr. Harper. It is
the Israelis who are the terrorists. They are attacking the civilians,
the children of Lebanon. They are bombing any access in or out of the
country. They are warning families to leave their homes, and then
bombing the homes so they cannot come back and killing any stragglers
they see as well. Do your dim eyes see only our Western media? Are you
even trying to see the truth? Hezbollah may have killed 20 or so
Israeli civilians, but they are primarily targetting military
stations. And we all know that they are no defence against the great
Israeli Army, not when that army is fuelled by American bombs and
support.

Do not forget who sent the first attacks, Stephen. It was not
Hezbollah. They kidnapped two soldiers - two men in the line of duty,
who crossed the border to raid their town. Not civilians. Not
innocents. And Israel gave the people of Lebanon no chance to escape
their retaliation before death befell them. Israel is defending
against no one. They are commiting genocide of Muslims under the mask
of war. If that is not true, why attack Northern Lebanon? Why attack
areas in which reside civilians alone? No Hezbollah, no ""terrorists""
in the North, Mr. Harper.

You have stated, Mr. Harper, that Canada will not participate in this
crisis. That we will not respond to the cries of help. If this, our
great peaceful, loving country will not respond, who will? In school I
was always taught that Canada's army is for peace-keeping, that when
there is a conflict or war, that when innocent people are being hurt,
we step in. Why are we not doing that, Mr. Harper?

The manpower we currently have in Afghanistan would certainly be able
to help out in evacuation efforts and peace-keeping in this crisis,
Mr. Harper. Why are we still illegally fighting in that country when
Lebanon's cries deafen our ears? Why do you not listen to your
citizens? Why do you listen soley to the fascist tyrant yelling from
his white house? Why do you not pledge yourself to Canada?

The country you're supposed to serve does not support Israel, I do not
support Israel and I do not support you.

I am deeply ashamed of what you are doing.

Signed,
An ever-proud Canadian,

Jessica Rose Powell

"event","i have spent some time today reading articles from <a href=""http://informationclearinghouse.info"">information clearinghouse</a> about the current war on lebanon. if you haven't heard of or been to that site, i highly recommend it. it was born out of one guy's frustration with they way american media doesn't show a lot of important news. for example, stories straight out of lebanon that aren't from israel's side. 

so anyway, here's a great article on the current israel/lebanon crisis. please don't be put off by the title, but my american friends you need to especially read this. 

<lj-cut text=""the shame of being an american"">

The Shame of Being an American 

By Paul Craig Roberts 

07/22/06 ""Information Clearing House"" -- -- Gentle reader, do you know that Israel is engaged in ethnic cleansing in southern Lebanon? Israel has ordered all the villagers to clear out. Israel then destroys their homes and murders the fleeing villagers. That way there is no one to come back and nothing to which to return, making it easier for Israel to grab the territory, just as Israel has been stealing Palestine from the Palestinians. 

Do you know that one-third of the Lebanese civilians murdered by Israel's attacks on civilian residential districts are children? That is the report from Jan Egeland, the emergency relief coordinator for the UN. He says it is impossible for help to reach the wounded and those buried in rubble, because Israeli air strikes have blown up all the bridges and roads. Considering how often (almost always) Israel misses Hezbollah targets and hits civilian ones, one might think that Israeli fire is being guided by US satellites and US military GPS. Don't be surprised at US complicity. Why would the puppet be any less evil than the puppet master?

Of course, you don't know these things, because the US print and TV media do not report them.

Because Bush is so proud of himself, you do know that he has blocked every effort to stop the Israeli slaughter of Lebanese civilians. Bush has told the UN ""NO."" Bush has told the European Union ""NO."" Bush has told the pro-American Lebanese prime minister ""NO."" Twice. Bush is very proud of his firmness. He is enjoying Israel's rampage and wishes he could do the same thing in Iraq.

Does it make you a Proud American that ""your"" president gave Israel the green light to drop bombs on convoys of villagers fleeing from Israeli shelling, on residential neighborhoods in the capital of Beirut and throughout Lebanon, on hospitals, on power plants, on food production and storage, on ports, on civilian airports, on bridges, on roads, on every piece of infrastructure on which civilized life depends? Are you a Proud American? Or are you an Israeli puppet?

On July 20, ""your"" House of Representatives voted 410-8 in favor of Israel's massive war crimes in Lebanon. Not content with making every American complicit in war crimes, ""your"" House of Representatives, according to the Associated Press, also ""condemns enemies of the Jewish state."" 

Who are the ""enemies of the Jewish state""?

They are the Palestinians whose land has been stolen by the Jewish state, whose homes and olive groves have been destroyed by the Jewish state, whose children have been shot down in the streets by the Jewish state, whose women have been abused by the Jewish state. They are Palestinians who have been walled off into ghettos, who cannot reach their farm lands or medical care or schools, who cannot drive on roads through Palestine that have been constructed for Israelis only. They are Palestinians whose ancient towns have been invaded by militant Zionist ""settlers"" under the protection of the Israeli army who beat and persecute the Palestinians and drive them out of their towns. They are Palestinians who cannot allow their children outside their homes because they will be murdered by Israeli ""settlers.""

The Palestinians who confront Israeli evil are called ""terrorists."" When Bush forced free elections on Palestine, the people voted for Hamas. Hamas is the organization that has stood up to Israel. This means, of course, that Hamas is evil, anti-Semitic, un-American and terrorist. The US and Israel responded by cutting off all funds to the new government. Democracy is permitted only if it produces the results Bush and Israel want.

Israelis never practice terror. Only those who are in Israel's way are terrorists.

Another enemy of the Jewish state is Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a militia of Shi'ite Muslims created in 1982 when Israel first invaded Lebanon. During this invasion the great moral Jewish state arranged for the murder of refugees in refugee camps. The result of Israel's atrocities was Hezbollah, which fought the Israeli Army, defeated it, and drove it out of Lebanon. Today Hezbollah not only defends southern Lebanon but also provides social services such as orphanages and medical care. 

To cut to the chase, the enemies of the Jewish state are any Muslim country not ruled by an American puppet friendly to Israel. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the oil emirates have sided with Israel against their own kind, because they are dependent either on American money or on American protection from their own people. Sooner or later these totally corrupt governments that do not represent the people they rule will be overthrown. It is only a matter of time.

Indeed Bush and Israel may be hastening the process in their frantic effort to overthrow the governments of Syria and Iran. Both governments have more popular support than Bush has, but the White House Moron doesn't know this. The Moron thinks Syria and Iran will be ""cakewalks"" like Iraq, where ten proud divisions of the US military are tied down by a few lightly armed insurgents.

If you are still a Proud American, consider that your pride is doing nothing good for Israel or for America.

On July 20 when ""your"" House of Representatives, following ""your"" US Senate, passed the resolution in support of Israel's war crimes, the most powerful lobby in Washington, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), quickly got out a press release proclaiming ""The American people overwhelming support Israel's war on terrorism and understand that we must stand by our closest ally in this time of crisis.""

The truth is that Israel created the crisis by invading a country with a pro-American government. The truth is that the American people do not support Israel's war crimes, as the CNN quick poll results make clear and as was made clear by callers into C-Span.

Despite the Israeli spin on news provided by US ""reporting,"" a majority of Americans do not approve of Israeli atrocities against Lebanese civilians. Hezbollah is located in southern Lebanon. If Israel is targeting Hezbollah, why are Israeli bombs falling on northern Lebanon? Why are they falling on Beirut? Why are they falling on civilian airports? On schools and hospitals? 

Now we arrive at the main point. When the US Senate and House of Representatives pass resolutions in support of Israeli war crimes and condemn those who resist Israeli aggression, the Senate and House confirm Osama bin Laden's propaganda that America stands with Israel against the Arab and Muslim world. 

Indeed, Israel, which has one of the world's largest per capita incomes, is the largest recipient of US foreign aid. Many believe that much of this ""aid"" comes back to AIPAC, which uses it to elect ""our"" representatives in Congress.

This perception is no favor to Israel, whose population is declining, as the smart ones have seen the writing on the wall and have been leaving. Israel is surrounded by hundreds of millions of Muslims who are being turned into enemies of Israel by Israel's actions and inhumane policies. 

The hope in the Muslim world has always been that the United States would intervene in behalf of compromise and make Israel realize that Israel cannot steal Palestine and turn every Palestinian into a refugee. 

This has been the hope of the Arab world. This is the reason our puppets have not been overthrown. This hope is the reason America still had some prestige in the Arab world. 

The House of Representatives resolution, bought and paid for by AIPAC money, is the final nail in the coffin of American prestige in the Middle East. It shows that America is, indeed, Israel's puppet, just as Osama bin Laden says, and as a majority of Muslims believe. 

With hope and diplomacy dead, henceforth America and Israel have only tooth and claw. The vaunted Israeli army could not defeat a rag tag militia in southern Lebanon. The vaunted US military cannot defeat a rag tag, lightly armed insurgency drawn from a minority of the population in Iraq, insurgents, moreover, who are mainly engaged in civil war against the Shi'ite majority. 

What will the US and its puppet master do? Both are too full of hubris and paranoia to admit their terrible mistakes. Israel and the US will either destroy from the air the civilian infrastructure of Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iran so that civilized life becomes impossible for Muslims, or the US and Israel will use nuclear weapons to intimidate Muslims into acquiescence to Israel's desires. 

Muslim genocide in one form or another is the professed goal of the neoconservatives who have total control over the Bush administration. Neocon godfather Norman Podhoretz has called for World War IV (in neocon thinking WW III was the Cold War) to overthrow Islam in the Middle East, deracinate the Islamic religion and turn it into a formalized, secular ritual. 

Rumsfeld's neocon Pentagon has drafted new US war doctrine that permits pre-emptive nuclear attack on non-nuclear states. 

Neocon David Horowitz says that by slaughtering Palestinian and Lebanese civilians, ""Israel is doing the work of the rest of the civilized world,"" thus equating war criminals with civilized men.

Neocon Larry Kudlow says that ""Israel is doing the Lord's work"" by murdering Lebanese, a claim that should give pause to Israel's Christian evangelical supporters. Where does the Lord Jesus say, ""go forth and murder your neighbors so that you may steal their lands""?

The complicity of the American public in these heinous crimes will damn America for all time in history.

oh, and there are definitely more pictures to come.. the connection just sucks now so i don't want to deal with that while trying to upload the many many picatures we already have. and this is only their 3rd day here."

"event","so here i am.

sitting on the floor in front of the compy, todd's sleepy toes hanging off the bed and wiggling beside me. 

i'm waiting for 2 ish to roll around so that i can wake him up and we can go get our paycheques, get another money order made up and pay our first month's rent at our new place. 

i'm a little concerned about a few things - we have no dishes, no furniture. i'm wondering what we'll do for the next few days in terms of food, as ryan is packing up almost all the dishes in the house. 

mostly, though i'm happy we're moving into a new place, i'm happy i'm alive on this earth, i'm happy i have great friends (like choump who is so very kindly helping us move), and i'm happy i have this wonderful boy wiggling his feet around in his sleep. 

i'm still fed up with my job - still wanting another. but i'm putting off the desperate searching for a week or two - i want to be settled before i go to interviews and whatnot. though i did apply for this online translating job thing. maybe that'll happen. *shrug* who knows. 

i'm very confident right now in the thought that things that are supposed to happen, do. and that every single moment is one you can learn from. 

i think i'm just happy to be moving onto the next stage in life. i always see moving as a new beggining, a fresh start. this is good, though it is also detremental sometimes because it makes me think ""i'll start eating healthy when i move."" or ""i'll not worry about this or that until i move."" it's okay though. cuz everything is always peachy. 

and also it's getting warmer. the rain of the weekend was freezing and i did not appreciate my standing in it. even without the rain it was so cold, but today is supposed to be 15 which is fine by me. 

i hope we can bring a shopping cart or two of boxes over to the new place today, tomorrow and friday. i need to check with lee - the girl who's still there. but she has her new place, so i hope it won't be a problem. 

craig is still the greatest little guy and todd is getting more and more proud of himself as a turtle dad. which is the cutest thing in the world. with our next paycheques (not the one today) we'll be getting him a huge tank. that should be great for him. he can swim around and still be the cutest. which he is. after todd. 

i also need to get my bike up and running. all i need is a new wheel - even after my $100 repair job last summer, the back wheel warped again, probably from when i was hit by that car. so i need a new one, which is only 30 bucks or so, so i shall do it this week. i hope. 

i don't really have anything else to say. so i will say: be well and have a wonderful day. 

all that love and squishy stuff,

"event","god<i>damn</i> lord of the rings was done so well. 

... the two towers is on tv. and i've been sitting on this couch for awhile.

not too surprising, considering i can barely move around properly cuz my neck is all stiff and sore from sleeping last nite... stupid sleeping. 

anyway, it's been the most of a long time since i've updated. which makes sense, on account of i only do this so i have memories and nothing memorable has happened in a while. 

good things are happening, though. like moving into a sweet apartment. and being more in love than ever before. and having a turtley guy who's healthy and adorable. and suddenly having a garbage smell waft towards me... no wait. why the hell does it suddenly smell like garbage?

hm. todd can't smell it. he brought me a sammich though. garbage or no, sammiches are delicious and in my stomach. well, a bite of <i>a</i> sammich is anyway. 

but yes. apartment. it's so delightfful. it's on the second floor of a house on dupont, west of christie. it's cozy and small. exposed brick walls, hardwood floors. you walk in with the little hallway-made-kitchen in front of you. bathroom (with tub!) beside you, on the left. the bright little living room is against the far wall, with washer and dryer around the corner. to your right, steep stairs go up to our loft bedroom (with triangly-attic ceiling), the other steep ladder-stairs go to our sweet rooftop patio. 

i am very happy with the way that all worked out. it's $1025 inclusive. which is just at the top of our budget. 

and we're still moving to victoria, but in october/november. we're leaving just in time to escape another toronto winter. hooray! and we now get to spend the summer smoking joints and drinking beers on our patio. and then falling our asses down our stairs. because it will happen. 

horses will kiss you awake, if you fall off a cliff into a river and end up on the bank.. and if your name is aragorn and you are an amazing guy. 

speaking of amazing guys, there's this guy beside me who is so good. like, there's bad guys and good guys. and normal guys. and then there's angels and heaven and perfection, and then there's this todd christopher aalgaard guy who's at the top of them all. and who squeals cute noises when he reads over my shoulder. *grin*

i'm trying to leave my job. well... that's not entirely true. i'm tired of my job and i complain about it a lot, and i'm tired of bullshit and standing (really, my feet hurt). but i haven't really been doing anything to get out of said job. ha. i'm moving. whatever. that's my excuse. 

really, i just want tasha to please, please, please give me a full-time data entry position at the pdot. that way, i can stay with this company and still have a good chance of getting some sort of officey-managerial position in victoria. or i can just give up on this thing and find a new job. whatever comes my way, really. 

okay. back to the lord of the rings. and to asking my beautiful boy for another sweet massage... please?

hooray! the answer is yes!

goodbye!

love!

not likely, though. i just really don't have enough to say. 

but what <i>do</i> i have to say?

hmmm

yesterday was st. paddy's, as you all probably noticed. i went up to steph's for pre-drinking fun. i was a little scared of drinking, so i stuck to the keiths. and the weed. so that was fun, then i came home cuz that's when todd was home from work. then i sobered up (*giggle*) and then we smoked some more. and ate breadsticks for dinner. 

""but jessica, why were you scared of drinking?"" 

wednesday a bunch of people came down for martinis. now, earlier wednesday i had a tooth ripped out of my face and was put on a liquid diet. so all i had to eat that day was some tomato soup. then i smoked up in a park. and then i had five martinis in a short amount of time. and then i threw up... A LOT. in the toilet (all my soup), over the fence at the lab, and then again when we got home. and i couldn't be in our room because i was afraid of claustrophobia and hot boxing. 

tonite we are going to springrolls for dinner and then to see a movie... but i can't remember which right now. why we fight.. or on the line... one of those. at the carlton. it's our much-belated-valentine's-day-dinner-but-it's-okay-cuz-we're-so-in-love. *giggle*

oh, yes. we're pretty sure little craig is a little girl. craigy, or craigley maybe. i also am now pretty sure that julie, the turtle at my mom's who i've had since i was four, who i named a girl name and then we thought must be a boy.. i think he's a she now, too. not totally sure, though, cuz i haven't seen ma little jewels since christmas time. 

so, about little girly craig. i wanna get her a tank. but am not going to till we're in victoria.. if we indeed go. see, in addition to the job offer he's got for cbc victoria, todd has had an interview now with cbc toronto. and his second interview is next week. for a job of 4-6 months of reporting on the arts in toronto. it pays a fuckload, and more importantly, he'd be part of the union. so, if he gets it we're staying. and <i>then</i> going to victoria. woop!

a'ight, i think i'm done. i want to eat some breakfast... though i don't know what, yet.

oh my GOODNESS am i happy!!! i just bought him some lettuce and carrots from the store and tossed them in, and then on a whim tossed in some sticks and he ate a whole quarter of one!!!!! THIS IS SO AMAZING!!!!!!!!





.... for those of you who <i>don't</i> know, craig is our new baby turtle. he's the cutest. he's aka buck-fitty (as of right now) cuz he's roughly the size of a looney and a half. and we've had him for a few weeks and he hasn't eaten a thing yet cuz he's been sick since before i got him. and stopped eating when he was with the chinese guy. but now he's ours and he's eating and looking around all curious and adorable and freaking out when he sees me!!! *squeal!* he's so damn cute!!!

in other news, todd and i are moving to victoria BC at the end of april. cuz todd got this sweet job doing radio segments for cbc. and cuz toronto sucks. 

*gasp* HE'S EATING MORE! well... he's trying to. i think the sticks need to be smaller for him. 

so yeah, we're moving. i'm gonna send out a mass email. or, i was going to. and i probly still will. 

today i got pulled off supervising cuz my numbers were very low. without explaining what that means, i'll just say i'm supposed to be at $3.50 and i was at 35 cents. .... that's very very very low. so i'm off supervising and i get a week to pull them up. if i don't, i get a verbal warning to pull them up  in a week. if i don't, i get a written warning for another week. and if i still suck, i'm gone. i just hope i can get them up so i can keep my job for the next two months. but already i've got a month guaranteed of that trying-to-get-my-numbers-up time, so it's all gonna be golden. 

today is the best day. i was just super happy fun times all day and with william, who's one of my favourites and my bro. and then craig ate. and we're gonna have triple decker garlic grilled cheeses and french fries for dinner cuz i feel like making them. and gordon's coming over. everything is rainbows and happy. 

i'm done with this now.

"event","this post should start with me saying how i'm enjoying a tea in a coffee shop on bloor, watching the traffic go by. it should say how awesome wireless internet is, that i can just connect wherever in these shops, because they provide that service to their customers. 

but i won't say that. 

while i am in a starbucks on bloor, and there is indeed a tea beside me (which i am quite enjoying) and the traffic is indeed going by, i am not connected to the internet. because when i tried to connect to the rogers hotspot, it didn't work at all, and when i connected to the bell one, they said i had to pay for it. and i say balls to that, sir. 

i should have gone to the second cup. but that's okay. i wanted to be closer to home anyway. which i now am. 

in other news, i just got back from the library. once i get over my strange nervousness and self-consciousness of looking for books when i don't know how, i am quite in love with libraries. i'm in love with them anyway. i love just sitting in the middle of row upon row of book spine, looking at the shelves and pulling from them random books to glance through, to be overcome with the old smell of book. i love books and i need to get off my ass and start making them.

i got life of pi, cuz i started reading it once in a grocery store while awaiting film to develop. and i wanted other books but they weren't in yet. i also got two books about the history behind toronto and its neighbourhoods and i'm quite excited to flip through those, as well. 

there's a guy over there, sitting against the far wall with a young girl and they're talking about the guy's portfolio. that's something i need to do. put together a portfolio of my best work, and start doing <i>something</i> with it.

maybe i'll just go home now and work on my scrapbooks. but even that feels to folky and crafty to be proper art. bah. 

i need to start taking my camera with me everywhere i go. cuz even right now i see perfect composition of line and space and light and colour. the movement of bloor street, of cars and trucks driving by and people wandering aimlessly or rushing down the street to get home for dinner. a man on a bicycle, and then a girl. the lights of all the streetlamps and the headlights and taillights and payphones and stores and signs. in front of me a blading man plays with beads in his hand as he deeply drinks his coffee and reads the paper. in the window before me i see reflections of the shop behind, a slight bustle and business with foam and steam and coffee beans. the chit-chat of the baristas, the interview going on, the scratch of a pen on paper and the discussion going on behind me in chinese that i can't understand; all in time with the clacking of my keys. 

well, i guess the sounds wouldn't show up on film. but having my camera (and not being shy or self-conscious of taking pictures in public) you'd get the impression of the noise and sounds of a starbucks on bloor. you'd just know it, your brain would fill it in. 

lalalalalala

i love this city. i really do. i was thinking of this just now while walking here from college street, walking up the little residential one-ways of robert street. i love looking into the big old houses, looking into living rooms and kitchens, looking at shelves of books and plants and rich, wooden coffee tables. i like seeing which houses have basement apartments, their stairs almost hidden in front of the porch. 

i've also been thinking a lot lately of interior decorating. imagining our housey apartment of this coming summer. a sudden flurry of images came to me the other day while walking home, images of how exactly i want to decorate our room. and i told todd and he stood slack-jawed and told me he'd imagined the exact same room a few years ago. *grin* i love the criss-cross roads of destiny and decision, and i especially love the palace i've already landed myself in. it's great. this thing called life. 

i like writing. even if i'm not making any sense. i like the actual physicality of typing on a keyboard and watching the words appear on the screen. 

so, the books i wanted to get are as follows:
-<u>a million little pieces</u> - james frey
-<u>the alchemist</u> - some guy... paulo? something like that

uhhhhhhh there were more. in any case, the point of that is for me to remember, and also that i need to read more. i've been out of school for months now and though at first a sufficient excuse of settling down was good enough, it's just sub-par now. i have no reason why i haven't been creating. none at all. and so i must start. i still have christmas presents i haven't even started yet. bleh. i'm pathetic. 

i need to start creating and looking at created things. reading, going to art galleries, even flipping through art mags. mostly i need to create, though. 

i want to buy a silkscreening kit. a small one. and also a little printing press, cuz i saw them in curry's for $300. but that won't be for a very long time cuz i still don't know how to save, and won't allow myself to buy anything for myself until i've done so, even a little bit. i was supposed to do that with this last paycheque, and didn't. though in my defence it was a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be. but still. 

i like making breakfast for todd. today it was the same as when i always do, but it's still espeically delicious (toast, scrammy eggs with cheese, and home-cut homefries). it makes me excited still about moving into our place this summer. i can't wait to have a kitchen that is mine to begin with. and i really can't wait to decorate. to have a hand at decorating every room. instead of moving into a space already done and only having our tiny little room to play with. 

okay. i think that's extremely long for an eljay post. and so i will finish this tea and head back up the street to the little hovel of 933. 

have a wonderful nite, everyone. 

love and hugs,
~jessica's typing face."

"event","we are... IN A TRAIN STATION. ""tell them i have bear powers,"" says todd, all decked out in his brand new toddy bear hoodie (complete with EARS.. he's the most adorable thing on this planet). 

we have 2 hours to kill before we catch our train. so that means update time. because somehow we've got some internet here. (i love laptops, btw)

ummmmmmmmmmmmmm

i'm excited to take the train again. on the way here, we had a 15 hour delay cuz a train derailed in front of us somewhere. this means it took 2 days to get out of ontario. but that meant we got to go around lake superior which was gorgeous, cuz there were hills and we went THROUGH them and it was all so pretty and lovely and awesome. it also means that on the last day (cuz we weren't supposed to be on the train anymore) we got free lunch and dinner. and also a free hotel that nite. which was SWEET. cuz it was a very very nice hotel. nice like the montreal ones are nice, only a little nicer. we had an amazing shower (after not having had one for 4 days... and not having a chance to fully touch each other in 4 days..) then we passed the fout. then todd was up all nite throwing up and had a huge fever all day. which meant we had to stay there another nite! but it was fun. cuz hotels are fun and so are boyfriends who sing songs about loving their girlfriends in their sleep. 

sometime the next day we made it to todd's dad's. it was late-ish. the next day, i was vomitous as well and later scott, todd's brother, also got this sickness. 

aside from that, it was a wonderful christmassy time. i got a moose backpack which is adorable as all hell from the todd guy, and also the CSI board game (at which he promptly kicked my sorry ass). and a ceramic sea turtle pipe which i cannot wait to smoke out of. woot. and other lovely presents from his family. (""who love the jessica rose beyond love itself,"" says todd... i wouldn't say beyond love itself, but they did quite like me, i must say *giggle*)

BOZACK.

so now we're here again. in the vancouver train station, awaiting 5 o'clock to roll around (it's 5 o'clock <i>somewhere</i>....)

the train is awesome. for the record. it's not too hogwartsy, leighann, but it is a wicked little community that just choo-fuckin-choos through the country. plus, seeing the entire country is pretty awesome. well, almost. we're gonna go to the east coast sometime next week or something. maybe. 

in other news, if i forgot to email you, our new year's eve party is a pyjama jimmy-jam. and it's at 933 bathurst st. so be there, fuckos. 

i think i'm done with this updating thing now. 

bye! love you all! see you, toronto, in a few days.

"event","seriously. the other day mr. todd was a poor sickly boy and in the midst of his fever/all-day-sleep he starts talking in his sleep. well, at first he was <i>singing</i> in his sleep, mostly about how much he loves his jessie rose. 

and then he had a massive giggle fit. and after that he asked me if i was going to formal with him, i said of course, and he smiled and said ""so we can dance..."" and then asked me if i wanted to play snapple, i said yes, he told me to get my coat and sang to himself that ""me and jessie rose are going on a date""

i swear. cutest. man. ever. 

there was also a point where he giggled and said ""BEAR!"" as if he just ran into him. and i said ""what's bear doing, sweetie?"" and he mumbled, giggled and said ""jackalope.""

*giggle* love isn't even close to this anymore.

i'm going to do a bigger update later about our train trip (complete with 15 hour delay!), free hotel room, him being sick, me being sick and et ceteras.

okay bye.

"event","woot. so life is pretty grand.

on sunday was the public outreach office party. it was fantastic. we went to this tiny little bar down the street and had karaoke and as much beer as we could drink. it was so much fun. i think i was halfway through my 5th beer when my head started pounding and i decided to switch to water. so i was pretty much sober by the end of the nite. though i still indulged in some karaoke... (""cecilia"" by simon and garfunkel and later ""always"" by bon jovi.. for todd *giggle*)

it was such a fun nite. everyone i work with is an awesome. everyone was trashed as well. todd was pretty drunk, which i don't ever really remember seeing before. and he basically became an eight year-old so it was just simply adorable. he kept assuring me on the walk home ""i'm drunk, but i can still take care of you."" it was so damn cute. i love my boy. and yeah, it was just a fantastic nite in general. yay.

in other news, i've decided that i eat far too much junk food. todd, goddammit, i can't keep eating all this crap. heh. i never get zits, and i've started to. my body is acheing all over and i'm usually totally fine in terms of health. i'm about to start working in frigid temperatures and if i'm not eating healthy, i'm gonna get sick A LOT sooner. so there's that. *grin*

i don't really have anything to say at all. i'm working a mall today. i don't have to be there till 4 but it's in mississauga so i need to take the go train. and it's gonna take me 2 hours to get there. *sigh*

yeah, i think that's about it. life's pretty amazing, i just don't do anything worthy enough of writing down.

amazing. todd had tears in his eyes for most of it, too. and he's never even read the books.

"event","hi y'all. i'm sitting here on my living room couch, listening to the traffic along bathurst and the ticking clock on the wall. the day has started and i'm waking up to it. 

today i'm working a mall. and that is fantastic. see, when you're in a mall, 3 or 4 things are awesome. one, you're not cold (generally speaking.) two, you get to sit down all day. three, we need to look professional which means i get to dress up like a grown-up lady and that is always so fun. also, my ass looks fantastic in my grown-up pants. and finally, the day passes faster than anything i've ever seen, until that last hour rolls around, of course. 

but it's all good fun. it also means i get to NOT wake up at 9 or whatever. which is always good. and i still get up early-ish (i don't sleep till the absolute latest i could, which is 1.30) so i feel very awake and satisfied and like i have a hold on the day when i get to work. except last time when i woke up at the time i was supposed to be at the mall. but that's another story altogether.

in other news, we've decided to take the train to BC for christmas and i am so gleeful. for three days i'm going to be chillin out with my toddly guy on train that traverses the entire country. i'm extremely excited for the mountain parts. and for the whole thing in general, really. yay! train! 

so i woke up on saturday morning to check my bank account. i thought i had something of 30$ in there. i wanted to make my boy some eggies for breakfast. however, when i check my account, i did NOT have $30 i had <b>-$250!!</b> apparently when you switch to part-time studies you enter into repayment status, which i didn't know, and you're supposed to start paying them <b>$230 a month.</b> there's a big but here. i never signed a form, nor did i give any other sort of authorization for them to take money out of my account. which means they stole from me. illegally. so, tomorrow (when i don't have to worry about working and i have all the day to be on the phone) i'ma phone them and not get off the phone until this is resolved. and by resolved, i mean i need to hear the words ""yes, we'll give you your money back."" assholes. it really makes no sense. i mean, for the kids who need to be working to be paying for school and everything, and so they need to be in part-time, they have to also be paying over 200$ a month to loans. that all around just doesn't make sense and makes me realise that poor kids just can't go to school.

i have to decide if i'm going back or not. i want to. i want to finish my degree. but now i don't know if i can. the jerks.

hmmmmmmmmm what else.. todd is fantastic. i don't know how it's possible but every morning i wake up feeling his warmth beside me and i look at his adorable sleeping face and i realise i'm more in love with him than i was the day before. it's just.. every little thing he does (from the way he plays with his hair, to the way he shakes a silly thought out of his head before he kisses me) just makes me want to squeal (which i usually do) and to search out all the beautiful little things in the world and give them all to him. cuz he deserves so much more than that. he's perfect. without question, he's the most beautiful person in the world to me and i am the luckiest girl on this planet.   

so, life in general is awesome. money sucks, but it always does and after crying about it on saturday i think i'm back to being in love with love and life. i have some big decisions to make about school but i'm sure whatever i end up doing, i'll be happy. i can't not be when every nite i sleep in the arms of a man who fits perfectly beside me like a puzzle piece. and when the sun rises each morning and the world keeps turning. it's just.. nothing bad lasts for long. life is too good for all the bad there can be.

that's it. morning ramblings from a pyjama'd girl. *grin*

love, hugs and tick-tocks, kiddos.

i don't know if that's happening. meaning, i was just on the famous players website and for all those theatres (yorkdale, the paramount and the yonge-eglinton centre) the earliest show time is for noon on friday.

is there another theatre i can't think of that would have it? i thought maybe it was that that's the earliest time for which you can buy advanced tickets, but no, i can't find a midnite opening for it. i'll call them later (maybe) and see if there is one that's not super advertised.. though you'd think it would just be on the website.

-What grade were you in? grade 8
-Where did you go to school? jack callaghan p.s. i met sarah face and mofer head there!

-Did you wear contacts? nope
-Did you wear glasses? no, not yet!
-Who was your best friend? chandra
-Who was your boyfriend/girlfriend? i think i ""dated"" michael gallant that year... but that also may have been in grade 7. we were really good friends and studied together every lunch when we had those stupid quizzes in french class, and then he asked me out. i said yes, and we didn't talk to each other for a week or so and then broke up. hahaha.
-Who was your favorite celebrity? i think that's when i was first discovering x-files.. so david duchovny
-What was your favorite TV show? x-files! yay!

-How many piercings did you have? none! at all!
-How many tattoos did you have? none
-What was your favorite band? *sigh*... backstreet boys... *shudder*

THAT'S ME!!!

hey kiddos it's been foweva since i done wrote in this thing.

hi!

life is grand. i'm really right now just procrastinating cuz i don't want to have to write that stoopid letter for the financial petition. honestly, just don't charge me thousands of dollars for nothing. that's too simple for york, though.

but yes. life. what a fantastic thing. i'm chilled from canvassing in the freezing land outside. but life is still grand. 

todd's right now being a pfu-er at the public outreach. i gotta go pick him up at 9.30. 

LET'S PLAY THE POINT-FORM-BREAK-DOWN-GAME-OF-THIS-LADY'S-LIFE!!!! 
*cheers and screams and applause and kids jumping up and down*

<b>work</b> - going well. i'm canvassing for the cancer society now. and the puppies still. no more babies, i told the office i hate sick kids in a canvassing-sense. i'm also getting used to the constantly-descending temperature and need to buy new shoes, i think. for foot reasons. of pain. from standing. NEXT POINT!

<b>toddly-guy</b> - just perfect. well, not JUST perfect. but fantastically, tremendously, every-moment-is-filled-with-sparkles-and-sunshine-and-kisses perfect. heh. i'm still giddy, maybe not as giddy as the summer, but still delightfully giddy being with him. and waking up to his stupid adorable face and snuggles every morning. it just makes sense, as much sense as breathing. it's comfortable and the way i was supposed to be. yay love.

<b>um.. my ... house?</b> - my roommates are awesome and so is living in a house with no rules. ryan scrubbed the house this morning so now everything but my room looks fantastic. yay roommates!

<b>uh.. free time...?</b> - i have more of it now but i don't do anything and need to start making art, getting out of bed, hanging out with people, and doin stuff. 

<b>THAT MONEY STUFF!</b> i still don't know how to save money but hope to start doing that with my very next pay cheque. 


those are all the breakdowns. other things that couldn't be categorized are: 
-my growing desperation for a puppy-dog companion;
-honest ed's - i can go in and not be lost, and i'm going to start buying all i can there;
-my shoulders hurt a lot all the time;
-if i don't do the laundry and wear clean clothes, i'm soon going to grow people out of my clothes. but they'll be little amoeba people who can only say ""VIGOROUS!"" in loud scary man voices that make you wonder where the keep them cuz they're so little and they're voice would be so big. that's right. i'm THAT dirty. ... our washing machine's been broked.
-i'm a little bit hungry but have a kitchen stuffed with food.

that's my life. i'm tired of this thing now so i'm done.

i love you all!

"event","dear school,

our time together has been really great. really, it has. i love you. i do. i mean that. you've given me so much, because of you i have so many wonderful people in my life and i've done a lot of things that i wouldn't have done on my own. i love all the experiences we've had together. all of them have been so great and wonderful. 

but lately i've just been so busy. i just can't spend all the time i need to on you. i just don't have the time; i don't have the energy. i need a break. please, don't be upset. this isn't over. i promise. this is just a break. not even a year, not even a gestation period. i'll be back to you in the summer, school. and then we'll have even more time together and i'll be able to focus more on you.

it's not that i hate you, it's just that sometimes i get overwhelmed. i know you must understand. you've had so many others like me. but i will be back. i promise. i just need a little time apart. 

until may, when i'm yours again.

~jessica.







--------------------------------------------------------------------

<b>so here it is</b>

i've realised that really, as todd said, school just isn't worth my tears. and really, it isn't. 

i realised yesterday i can't afford paper for my current (the first) print project. that i wouldn't even be able to start printing until next friday. when the project was due today. and it's a 5% a day deduction... so i'd be screwed. and my next paycheque would already have half going to damage deposits. i also wouldn't be able to start my photography printing until next week. which is no time. and ditto for my lithography class. basically, i figured, i would then be late with the second projects as well. and it would all spiral out of control with tears and living penny by penny, paycheque by paycheque and wondering how i'll eat.

that's not how i want my life to be. i hate being poor, i hated growing up struggling with money, and if i can prevent that, i'm going to. 

so i'm taking a year off. it took a lot of crying and sleeping on it and mulling it over to come to this decision. mostly because i'm scared i won't finish school. but i'm promising myself now that i'll go back in the summer, and then next year. and todd said he wouldn't hate me if i made us stay in toronto another year.

so now.. now i get to live. downtown. and work. and it will be awesome. i'm already so excited about being able to have my own money. about not having to spend it as soon as i get it. about getting a cell phone, and doing a mega huge grocery run. i'm very excited that i did nothing today when i got home. and that i get to sleep in tomorrow and do absolutely nothing all day. i've already cleaned my room, am going to unpack everything this weekend or coming week. all i have to worry about is filling out this petition and writing a letter so that i don't have to pay anything of the tuition. and that i need to go see the head of the fine arts department about pulling some strings. i hope that all goes okay, because i really can't afford to pay 60% of anything. 

this also means that i now have more free time to hang out with all of you. there's irony in the fact that not going to school will allow me to hang out there more often. oh, the mcdonald's thing is that yesterday i bought some fries and that's why i couldn't afford paper. so there. mcdonald's sucks even more. heh.

and now i get to go eat dinner with the love of my life and watch some teevee or something. and do more of nothing.

life, yet again and as always, is beautiful and amazing. 

peace out, kids.

i don't really want to write much else... mostly cuz i want to go away from the print studio and my class i just left... but i feel like this is a good idea. and now i have to fill out a bunch of forms and talk to people so i don't have to pay any money to this stupid goddamned school.

i'll tell you all the details later. i love yous guys."

"event","i was just officially unpacking my suitcase from bc so i could give it back to the pretty leighann lady. and yes, i realise it's been a few weeks since i've been home, but i've been lazy and have had a pile of clothes on top of said suitcase. but anyway, i found my notebook again, in which i wrote a thingie while i was on the plane for the first time and had plans to post it so here it is.

<lj-cut text=""flying for the first time."">
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
july 11, 2005 <i><--- finally!</i>
good day, sunshine.

i can't fully believe that i'm on this plane right now - that i'm on a plane, period. i'm sitting right on top of the wing which means i can't see directly below us but whatever - i'm on a fucking plane! and todd was right - this is the best way to travel.

my sense of direction is all off but i know that we're going west [well duh, says i right now]. the sun's directly in front of us which for awhile left me blinded cuz i was glued to the window.
we're passing over some lake(s?) i assume they're the great lakes but i don't know which ones for sure and my not paying attention in grade 9 geography is only now catching up to me.

I CAN'T WAIT TO LAND!

i can't believe there's gonna be todd waiting for me. i can't fully believe any of this. i think they just showed on the tv where we were, what exactly we were passing over but i wasn't paying attention.

there's a really nice flight attendant who i told this was my first flight so she keeps checking up on me. *grin* she's young, too. like mid-20's. i can't go see the cockpit while in the air, though. she said i could at the end but that would delay me that much more from running into todd's arms.

alright, i'm going to sit back and watch the clouds now. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</lj-cut>


i also re-found this magazine about vancouver island that mysteriously appeared in my backpack and looking through it just now, i was filled with this feeling of complete, desperate longing to be looking at those sights again, right now. *le sigh*

i'm bored. days off are cool, but i need more to do. and cleaning just doesn't sound tempting enough to make me do it today. *giggle*

love, hugs and lazy days

"event","i got very very drunk. more drunk, i think, than i wanted to be, and i wanted to be TRASHED. i drank an entire bottle of butter ripple schnapps, but i've done that before and haven't even felt drunk afterwards. but i haven't drank in a long time... so i guess my tolerance is way down. and then i shared in the smoking of two hash joints. so i was plenty fucked. 

leighann is the greatest person this world has ever seen. she got us gone in time to catch the very last subway train. she was there to pet my back and tell me wonderful comforty mom things as i puked in the garbage can, on the train, in the garbage bag at downsview, on the bus and at the elevator here. she wouldn't let me apologise at all, though i kept doing it over and over. she kept assuring me that drinking the water will make me pee it all out and i won't have to puke anymore. she made sure i brushed my teeth when we got home, and read me goodnite moon once i was in bed, lulling me completely into a deep, wonderful sleep. 

i love you, lady. 

in other news, i am SO excited to live in that house next year. i'll be able to just walk down the street and buy a pizza, or grab a beer, or meet my dealer, or do ANYTHING. i'll be living with ryan tyler thomas, d.r.e.w. and the jon blair.. who individually are the awesomest people in the world, and collectively blow my socks off with their fantasticness. 

now i'm going to start my day of lazing around and doing dick all. cuz it's my day off and i need to. heh.

love and hugs and no hangover!!! i love my body!

"event","so.. looooooooooong time no update. i sorry. it's only been a few weeks, though.

i've mostly been working. that's about it, really. haha. 

tonite is james and brookie's going away party and i plan on getting RIGHT fucked. then they leave in a little over a week which sucks, cuz no more dad days or fatherly advice whenever i need it. but i'm proud of him for finally getting his ass out of here. 

plus, having a house to live in is going to be very very nice.

today me and nicholas and puff went out into the massive storm and played in the giant river that was formed by the rain. the entire tennis court was flooded. you couldn't see the pool. and it was all rushing into the forest. so we followed it. it was like rapids. i'm not kidding, there was this one part where it starts to join the actual river and it was a giant whirlpool. it was insane. then puff cut his foot and was scared of aids so we came inside. heh.

life is generally the best thing on earth. well, second best. next to ocean eyes. *smile*

work is going okay. i'm not doing very well, neither is the humane society of which i am right now the only supervisor. so it very much feels like it's on my head if it succeeds or not. but whatever. i'm not worrying myself over it cuz it's just work and it's not really worth it. and apparently now supervisor's numbers don't really matter at all, it's more important that the crew does well. so i'm never ever gonna be fired, no matter how much i suck.

and licia's back in town! i've gotten so used to that that i totally forgot i haven't written about her. it was so fucked up, the nite she got back. i was just sitting here on the computer, chatting with todd and ma auntie-lady and i heard someone come in the door. but people had been going in and out all day so i didn't bother to turn around.. until there was enough of a pause that i did.. and i just could not fucking believe it! it was awesome. screaming ""what the fuck! what the FUCK?!"" and running over to her. and she's been around a bit, looking for a job and an apartment, and it has all been rad and like before.

i think that's about it. 

well.. aside from the fact that i'm completely and totally head over heels in love with todd christopher aalgaard. and that he's also deeply in love with me. *beams* and that i smile and feel like magic every time i think of him. and i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. *giggle* 

/sappy girl-ness.

okay NOW that's it. *smile* 

love and hugs, everybody.

"event","or something similar to that... oh stoned-todd, how silly you are. *grin*

*yawn* i'm terribly sleepy and coming off of being slightly drunk. so apparently not having pubnites, and not being drunk on a weekly basis, means that my tolerance has plummeted in severe amounts, meaning that 2 beers will get me quite smiley and on my way to a high drunktitude. *giggle*

we've just come off todd's weekend which was spent in sunshine and magical moments. at some point (it's impossible to remember days of the week out here) we went to quadra island, which is gorgeous and where we're going to live when i move out here when i'm all done school. i'm excited at the plentitude of hippies, coastline and cheap rent in one gigantic forest, as well as the fact that there's only 1 gas station and no stores to speak of. we went to this lodge for drinks and ended up getting delicious-looking and -tasting veggies while sitting in the sun, overlooking the straight at campbell river, mountains on the horizon, ocean dotted with sailboats surrounding everything, and 2 local eagles watching over us from a tree high above. 

that nite we went to see charlie and the chocolate factory, but we were late for the show so we saw war of the worlds instead. it was good. not my favourite movie, but it was good. and creepy. and hooray for colds and sneezing. 

that nite we got right fucked off the herb down on the beach. the moon was rising right above us, the light dancing to the symphony of the waves crashing on the shore. there were 4 cruise ships passing by that left us entranced and both of us had moments where we tried not to think of disturbing images left in our minds from the movie we'd just seen. bwwwoooooooooooooooooong. then we came back here and pigged the fout and watched... something.. i'm sure... but i can't for the life of me remember what.

the next day, yesterday, we went out to dinner and charlie. it was really, really fun. it was perfect. the movie was and is awesome, in spite of the fact that the oompa loompas are played by the same actor who was that creepy fucker from the x-files with no legs on the squeaky thing. *shudder* last nite we smoked on the beach again. we pre-planned in our brilliance and had bought dariy milk chocolate bars so that when we opened them in the darkness of nite on the beach, sufficiently stoned, we could pretend to our delight that they were indeed wonka bars. todd really wanted a golden ticket, but i was happy as fuck with the delicious chocolate in front of me. 

at some point we realised we could see mars and it was the first time i've ever realised the distance i was looking through to see this other planet. cuz always when i see planets or stars in the sky, they're dots. they're something in the inky blackness of nite. whereas last nite, that little red dot was a physical object -- a planet, an orb far away -- and i was so aware of that distance. it was awesome and i was quick to exclaim all about it in a rush and quite loudly. unfortunately i had forgotten about the random guy who had pulled up behind us and was listening to us as he smoked a cigarette which freaked me the fout and made me shut up until he was well-gone. then we came home and watched todd's new family guy and i passed the fout until 2 this afternoon. 

today we lazed around and did nothing until we went to the pub down the street and todd got me drunk off the somethingsbury rainforest amber ale. i've realised that pale ales are where my taste buds dance, but the amber is quite delicious when i'm a quarter of the way through it. yum for beer. 

that's it. 


BYE KIDS!

guh. i have this cold and it's gross. and it makes me cough and be snot-filled alla the time. but i found some buckley's and todd made me eat some echinacia and apple juice and i should probly go to bed. bah.

today we didn't really do anything. we just hung around here for awhile, played video games with his dad and went out for photo-developing and dinner. *grin* it was perfect, though. it always is. 

last nite we got stoned, of course. and i realised that while i can deal with spiders just fine when i'm sober, when i'm stoned it's a different matter altogether. there was one yesterday (he was big, in my defence) crawling on the ceiling as we watched that '70's show and frasier. he hung around near the tv for awhile, but once he started moving (and moving directly towards me and above me *shudder*) i freaked out and eventually jumped out of the way, leaving todd to smoosh the bastard. lol. 

yesterday we drove around, eventually ending up in comox at the harbour where we played on swings again. *grin* on the way, we stopped at this huge forest and took the winding foot path through it down to seal beach. it was gorgeous, but everything is out here. 

that's about all that's happened. i'm getting really sleepy so i'm a stop this posting thing now.

"event","i swam in the ocean today!!!!! it was pretty cold and um... really salty. haha. but man! i was in the PACIFIC OCEAN today!!!! it was awesome. and sandy. and i never realised before how much water i consumed when i swam but gah it's gross. haha. 

i also laid out in the sun and tanned this morning, after laying in the sun not in my bathing suit, while todd played his guitar for me. *grin* it was an awesome wake-up, a great morning, a wonderful day. 

then we drove around and got pizza for dinner and did nothing, really, which is fabulous. 

last nite we got stoned. and todd was much better at the star wars game than he had been the nite before when i kicked his ass. a lot. *giggle* i also managed to kick his dad's ass multiple times and he has yet to try and get me back. 

ummmmmmmmm last nite i also became captain giggles, said todd. and that made an image pop into my mind which made me giggle even further. the image is of a giant medow (it's all cartoon) full of bright flowers and rainbows and i'm wearing a captain pirate hat, with my hair being a big poofy curly mess it is and the hat's too big and i have like a wooden sword or a lasso or something and i'm riding a multicoloured unicorn. hm.

hmm what else. i think yesterday was the day we went to the comox valley which is absolutely gorgeous. we parked at the beach and sat on a bench overlooking the water where a nerdy fat-kid with boobs was yelling at us to take a picture of him. *shudder*

oh speaking of pictures, i've now taken 7 rolls.. i think. 6 or 7. or something. anyway. the last one i got back is amazing. this is the first time in my life where i can say that i'm happy with every picture on a roll. not overly happy with some, but there aren't any that i don't like. and there's this one of todd that's the most amazing........ well you'll all see them sometime. if i ever scan them in. maybe i'll do that now... no. i know i won't. haha. 

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand done.

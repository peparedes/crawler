I once said that I'd hate to be someone's convenience. 

that's an abbreviated version of why I'll never complain about being lonely again, and why I'll never tell anyone anything of substance again. I'm tired of synthetic emotional responses and the way you dramatize without considering anything but your own typographic industry of melodrama. 

look somewhere else 
besides the mirror 
for your suffering 
and please 

stop.

I've been in the midst of the most amazing people and conversations, experiences, etc, etc, and pinned under glass by some other things that aren't quite as lovely. I've been having vivid dreams that I really hope are just my mind freaking out and not significant to reality. fuck. I swear I could be a good person if I get myself through this (drama, school, tickets, etc)... if anyone has anything else to say, fucking step up"

That's killing me. I pay a billion dollars a week to have short lived conversations on my phone, I'm growing apart from everyone that has a different fucking area code, and the people around me.

www.suntimes.com
Forget to do something this February?
February 29, 2004
BY ZAY N. SMITH SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST

Anthony Dinolfo had the thought in 1969 while he was watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.
He is almost certainly the only person who had the thought.
""I said I wouldn't be surprised if he found a shopping cart in one of the craters,"" he said.
Then again, why not?
Dinolfo's shopping carts, from his grocery, Sparkle Food Center on the Southwest Side, had turned up
almost everywhere else.
That was the thought. And that was the start of it.
It was the start of National Return Carts to the Supermarket Month.
""It just sort of evolved,"" he said. ""You'd be amazed why people steal these carts.""
This is, in fact, the final day of the 35th National Return Carts to the Supermarket Month.
""Sometimes kids take joyrides in them,"" he said.
And there is still work to do.
***
Dinolfo, 77, has always known groceries. His mother and father ran a small grocery on the South Side.
His earliest memories are of groceries.
""They liked to say I was born behind the deli during a slow period,"" he said.
He enlisted in the Army Air Corps at the age of 17 and did his duty in the Philippines during World War II.
He and his wife, Mary, then raised three sons who have since given him seven grandchildren and one
great-granddaughter to dote on.
But here is where he has left his mark: National Return Carts to the Supermarket Month.
It is his crusade.
""People don't realize,"" he said. ""It's a major theft.""
People don't realize it at all.
***
Sylvan Goldman, an owner of the Piggly-Wiggly chain, invented the shopping cart in 1936 in Oklahoma
City, Okla., by adding two wire baskets and wheels to a folding chair.
People didn't like them at first. Goldman finally hired fake shoppers to wheel them around, showing how
useful a shopping cart could be.
People got to like them. People have been taking them ever since.
Sure. OK. But what are a few shopping carts?
Shopping carts cost more than $100 apiece.
The Food Marketing Institute estimates 1.8 million of them are taken each year in the United States.
""Who do you think pays for this?"" Dinolfo said. ""Your food costs more, is who pays for this.""
***
And so the battle has been joined.
Some supermarkets send trucks out on patrol to look for abandoned carts. Others depend on ""retrieval
contractors,"" who roam in search of carts and a bounty of $1 or so each.
""A lot of people don't exactly steal the carts,"" Dinolfo said. ""They just use the carts to take their groceries
home a few blocks and leave them.""
Other stores are going high-tech.
""Our devices are selling extremely well,"" said Don Chartrand of Carttronics, a San Diego, Calif., firm that
urges store owners to ""take control of your fleet"" with ""comprehensive cart containment solutions.""
The Carttronics solution is a device installed on each cart that, with the help of radio signals, causes a
front wheel to jam the moment the cart is taken beyond where the supermarket would like it to be.
It costs about $50 a cart. But Chartrand said it isn't as expensive as it seems.
""Some stores lose their entire fleet more than once a year,"" he said. ""And if you think about the slim profit
margins in the business, about 1 or 2 percent, that means a store has to sell about $5,000 worth of
groceries to replace a cart.""
Then again, people keep taking the things.
Dinolfo said he has seen the carts used for taking clothes to the laundromat, as newspaper delivery carts
for carriers and as backyard barbecue grills.
""I saw one where they hacksawed the basket off the cart at a car repair shop and used it to wheel motors
around,"" he said. ""We saw one young man who hacksawed the back off. He was a weightlifter, and he
used it to haul his weights.
""These carts are very strong.""
The homeless often use them to hold their possessions, too. In this case, let them be, Dinolfo said.
***
Dinolfo is retired now. But he still administers his month each year.
""It's an awareness campaign,"" he said. ""We're just trying to get the word out to people so that maybe they
will give it some thought -- and return their shopping carts.""
It has helped with awareness in the past. It inspired a campaign among Arizona grocers that included a
""Calling All Carts"" ad campaign and a hotline for a time -- (800) THE CART -- and was credited with the
return of more than 230,000 shopping carts over several years.
And the month will help with awareness in the future.
""We keep getting calls,"" Dinolfo said. ""It's a matter of communication. I remember when we put out the
word at the Sparkle Food Center. People would start bringing back carts. We would give anyone who
brought back a cart a gallon of ice cream.""
So, anyway. Return your cart, will you?
That is all Dinolfo needs, and he will leave you alone.
""Except for all the milk crates,"" Dinolfo said. ""And the ice cream baskets. . . ."""

After I realized what a cock he is, I told him to ""fuck off... haha"" and he gave me four shifts... busing shifts. I am going to clean tables for the next two weeks, and pick up back breaking bus pans. Man, I hate The Rite Spot.
Oh yea, I totally made seven dollars in tips tonight. 

In the last five years, I haven't lived in one location for over a year. Jacksonville is very much over due. And I've decided since I have no ties anymore, I might as well just run away to New York. Not New York City, I want to move to Rochester, and camp in Highland Park. I don't think I want any friends either. And I'll eat garbage plates. You would think that ""eating a garbage plate"" is disgusting, but let me inform you that you are completely mistaken. Everyone needs to eat a garbage plate. They're completely delicious.

"event","Alex and I hit every Super Walmart in a ninety mile radius between 2 and 4am last night. Who knew that they all could be just as fun as the last when added with a bottle of my mothers table wine? Not me. 
We bought a movie called ""Frogs: Today The Pond... Tomorrow The World!"". The back of it says ""A shocker reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's <i>The Birds</i>"". Let me tell you, it WAS reminiscent of <i>The Birds</i>! 

Wait! I have to tell you what the back says:

This amphibious horror flick teeming with thousands of nasty-tempered creatures that are hopping mad- and murderous. Jumping with action, suspense, revenge and Southern Gothic charm, <i>Frogs'</i> stars Ray Milland, Sam Elliot and Joan Van Ark are constantly a lily pad away from croaking!
Jason Crockett (Milland) is an aging, physically disabled millionaire who invites his family to his island estate for his birthday party. The old man is more than crotchety... he's crazy! Hating nature, Crockett poisons anything that crawls on his property. But on the night of his shindig, it's nature's payback time, as thousands of frogs whip up every bug and slimy thing into a toxic frenzy until the entire environment goes environ-<i>mental</i>.


BRILLIANT! Especially the puns!
Apparently Andy Warhol was pretty stoked on this movie.


So, in the last several days I have found Motley Crue on Myspace, told my boss I was going to quit The Rite Spot, and fell in love with the Mexican dish pit boy, Felix aka Lix. Things sure are looking up. 
I now no longer have to go through my CD case to listen to Girls, Girls, Girls, nor do I have to work six days a week and make one hundred dollars AND AND Lix wants to learn English AANNNDDD he's getting rid of his jerry curl for me. How sweet is that?
No, really though, I have decided to focus primarily on three things: Money, housing, and friends. Education next semester! I'm okay with that. 
When I have money I am going to get a studio apt. somewhere that will allow me to keep a big, mean, dog. His name with be Task Force, in leiu of Alex's lizard, and he will kill anyone that is not me, and help me with my math homework. True story."

I'm over the copious amounts of tickets, the Florida school system beating me with thorny sticks, and my one hundred dollar a week pay check. 
But anyways, today should be filled with fried chicken fun, putting my drivers seat window back into the whats-it-called, getting over my lovely sore throat, calling in on my ten day notice for the pack of tickets I obtained, and laughing over the fact I got pulled over yet again last night. This is what I get for not going to New York. Or something. 
I cannot wait for my little black cloud to get bored and leave me alone. 

Here's a little highfive to the start of 2006!

The Far Field
 
I dream of journeys repeatedly:
Of flying like a bat deep into a narrowing tunnel
Of driving alone, without luggage, out a long peninsula,
The road lined with snow-laden second growth,
A fine dry snow ticking the windshield,
Alternate snow and sleet, no on-coming traffic,
And no lights behind, in the blurred side-mirror,
The road changing from glazed tarface to a rubble of stone,
Ending at last in a hopeless sand-rut,
Where the car stalls,
Churning in a snowdrift
Until the headlights darken."

And then I noticed a bill for them: $76.89, which had my mothers signature on them. Cool. She refused to buy my graduation pictures because they were forty bucks. 

I drive my sister to school in the morning, and give my brother lunch money because my mom is a twit and forgets to give it to him. Do I see a few bucks for gas? Or a reimbursement for my brothers lunch? No. On top of that, there is no fucking food in the whole goddamn house. No milk, bread, eggs, mac n chease. Nada. All I can find is some stuffing mix, leftovers from 200 b.c. and an empty juice container. 

We do have the money to buy these necessities to live, however my mother just got her hair recoloured and touched up. She also decided she needed several long sleeve jackets. Hell! The only long sleeve anything I own is from the little boys section in Goodwill from tenth grade. 

I'm not really upset about myself as much as I am about my younger brother and sister. They can't get jobs or fend for themselves. Actually, I can't either when I'm supporting them along with myself at $120 a week. 

ON TOP OF THAT: My mother switched my college accounts into my name because she couldn't afford to have her credit fucked up. I've got to have the worst credit for a person my age. Thanks mom!

I honestly do want to kill her."

Read a book in six months 
except something called The Retreat from Moscow
by Caulaincourt 
Nevertheless, I am happy 
Riding in a car with my brother 
and drinking from a pint of Old Crow. 
We do not have any place in mind to go, 
we are just driving. 
If I closed my eyes for a minute 
I would be lost, yet 
I could gladly lie down and sleep forever 
beside this road 
My brother nudges me. 
Any minute now, something will happen."

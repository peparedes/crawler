"event","I more than likely take things a day at a time. Hour by hour. Minute by minute. Never putting too much on my plate or plan too many events for a timed period of a week or less. When you have that sort of imbalance within your schedule you tend to crash and burn, making it hard to float back to the surface of reality and comprehend the fact you're not a robot or any form of mindless machinery. You can't take on the world with a handheld computer and a pen and think that's going to help you achieve the awesome goals you have set for yourself. You go blind with confusion. That bar that we often cross has vanished and has been replaced with rewards. Cash money, cars, and mansions have replaced the simplicity of a job well done or even a relationship with another human being.

The sheets have gone from a subtle chill to unbearably cold and I can't seem to stand it another minute. I'm putting myself back on the market as of now as scary as that may be for me to do. Ever since the divorced I've been locked in a hidden cave. The people in my life have tried time and time again to cheer me up and set me up with numerous women who hold no interest of mine. I've been scratching my way out of this cavernous jail, trying desperately to cope with the realization she's no longer with me. I've finally come to terms and I think laughter was my only medicine in this rare case.

I'll try to make an appearance on AIM tonight. I'm not making any promises."

"event","The hell? Who do I think I am? Meg? I am in serious need of an update with substance. Can someone write it for me?

Okay, okay. Fine. I'll do it. If I have to.

One night a couple of weeks ago, Deb and I stayed up late making icons. I made about 20 for myself and was really excited about the whole ordeal. Well, the computer I made them on crashed not too long ago and with it all of my icons. I was pretty upset. I had some documents on there that meant a lot to me. Letters, e-mails, stalker pictures Meg has sent me, things of that nature. You never can really trust machines. Except for robots.

Is there a poker game this weekend? Am I going to be invited to that or am I going to be left out? Wouldn't be the first time, isn't that right MEG? Why is she pretending to marry Nick when I am all the man she needs? Why is this whole paragraph full of questions? Sometimes I just never know? Okay, that wasn't a question. But why fuck up the vibe?

I sign on AIM but Deb is never on so there is really no point. I'm off to make new icons. Pout."

"event","Deb has one. Meg has one. Sean has one. Harry has one. I don't think I have to go on into further explanation as to why I'm here. It's pretty obvious. I'm used to being the trend setter but I guess I'll have to take a back seat this time around. Then again Meg's dog has one. Does anyone else find this amusing? Maybe my goldfish will show up. I'll have to teach it to type."

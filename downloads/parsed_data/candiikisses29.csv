It took us about two hours to get to college this morning.

We ended up missing the WHOLE class.&nbsp;

People cant really drive in this stuff.

They are kinda idiotic.


Buuuuut Kayla and i went to go talk to Dr. AC to make sure we knew what we missed.

And, i am actually feeling really comfortable about paper 1C.&nbsp;
Its exactly like what we used to do in AP English.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, lets hope i can remember exactly how to do this.


Now I am off to finish paper 1B."

"event","Wow. Today can definately go on my list of Worst Days Ever.<br /><br />It started out with an interesting Government class.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then after school, a nice little event happened. (An event that i am not going to go into) Resulting in me BALLING. and Terrified.<br /><br />Then Kayler and i almost die on the way home from Coldstone. All thanks to some really drunk guys. Or atleast thats how it seemed with the way they were driving. (i.e Almost driving into the median....Head on.)<br /><br />Then i come home, and read something someone had posted on their myspace. Yes, i do realize i am talking about something someone posted...On MYSPACE....but, this is not the first time this has happened.&nbsp;<br /><br />It said something to the fact that she hates a certian song (lips of an angel) because of a certian ""BLONDE WHORE""<br />and that there are two people that she would like to punch in the nose...those two people jsut happened ""to be best friends"". <br /><br />Yes, i realize that that isnt that specific. but i know. i know thats about me. its not the first time i have had issues with her. She threatened to kick my ass at the HOMECOMING GAME because i was ""taking shit"" about her and her boyfriend. <br /><br />Her. no. but the&nbsp;boyfriend. Yes. i mean&nbsp;he was my ex. he broke up&nbsp;with me and INSTANTLY started&nbsp;dating her.&nbsp;Even when he told me he&nbsp;""loved me"" and&nbsp;""would always love me"" and ""wouldnt want to hurt me. ever again.""&nbsp;That was&nbsp;screwed up.&nbsp;But that whole situation is besides the point and old news.<br /><br /><br />Buuut&nbsp;as you all know how that song goes. A guy has a girlfriend, and his ex girl or lover or whatever calls him....ect, ect. You&nbsp;know the song.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />and i know she thinks&nbsp;I still have&nbsp;a problem with him and her dating. Buuuut i dont, i got hurt by him WAYYY to much. and im over it. i moved on. and i am pretty sure he moved on. now <strong>she</strong> just needs to move on.&nbsp; I dont want to be with him.&nbsp;In fact, &nbsp;I am glad she came around. because if&nbsp;she hadnt. i can almost guarantee that him and i would still&nbsp;be in a relationship. <strong><u>Miserable</u></strong>.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am so tired of&nbsp;High School drama. I am ready&nbsp;for college. <br /><br />LIFE HERE I COME! WILLING TO DO&nbsp;ANYTHING TO&nbsp;GET OUT OF THIS DRAMA FILLED HELL HOLE!&nbsp;I AM READY FOR LIFE!<br /><br /><br />(finally,&nbsp;I am not deathly&nbsp;scared of life and the future)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p>So, I'm sitting here doing my project for Government.&nbsp;<br /><br />My group's topic is ""Anti Government Symbolic Speech Protest""<br /><br />We have to discuss the symbolism of burning the American flag.<br /><br />While researching for the subject i came across a web page that had ""Flag Code"" or the acceptable rules when it comes to the American Flag.<br /><br />It stated that it is not acceptable to ""wear the flag&nbsp;<font size=""2"">as wearing apparel"","" It should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free."" and many other things. like you arent supposed to make a flag into a cake because you cut it up and eat it and such.<br /><br />Its amazing the things we have rules about.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And on that note. I am realllllly reallly not looking forward to English class tomorrow. i havent even opened my Big Fish book this semester. Yes, i admit it, i didnt actually read the first 90 pages, i somehow remembered all of it from last semester. I realize thats not a good thing, and i should actually be reading it. But hey, i still made a 100 on that quiz. I even knew the giants name was Karl. <strong>:]]<br /></strong><br />and i dont look forward to reading the other half. which i should actually read since, i kinda stopped paying attention to what i was reading.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yeahh, thats what i will be doing tonight. Reading Big Fish. I might need some Starbucks before starting to read. Because with the way i have been sleeping, reading the most exciting novel could put me to sleep, let alone a book i have already read. And i wasnt to fond of it the first time around either.<br /><br /><!--footer--></font></p>"

The first time really wasnt all that bad. But i dont want to read it again. atleast not all within the same school year.

I have to wait forever to reread books. The repition is not fun.

But i figure i will have to suck it up if i want to do good in this class this semester."

I am so so so so SOOOOO frustrated.

I have decided i give up on having a love life. Simply because i always seem to be screwed over by guys.

It happened YET AGAIN. last night. Third time in almost 4 months.

Daniel decides to tell me that he still loves his Ex, that he told me he was over.
and he doesnt know what to do. 

He wants me to help him decide. HOW THE HELL CAN I HELP HIM DECIDE THAT. 

All i told him was that i understand and that i have been there, then he asked me waht i did, and i told him that i moved on. 

I really dont know what to do."

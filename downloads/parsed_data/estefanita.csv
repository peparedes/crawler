And it worked out for a while, but then we started to drift...I managed to look over my notes for a while, and I copied the notes from Thursday since I was out, and then I decided that that was all I would do.  Way to go Steph.  I'll look at it some more when I get home.  I mean, a couple hours of studying isn't too bad, right?  And I'm gonna study some more for Thursday, since that's when we have our first exam.  I'm not really stressing it though, since I already know the stuff and it's really all reviewing for me.  No biggie.  Anyways, I'm gonna go play a game now.  See ya!"

Without my insurance it would have been $2050, so I really should be grateful, but that's still a lot of money that I have to pay.  My dad has decided that since it's my teeth, that I have to pay for it.  All of it.  Oy.  And to think that I didn't even want to have them pulled.  I'd rather sit and suffer.  Humph.

Everyone should go and see it pronto.  I knew that there would be adult humor in it, as usual, but there was an abundance this time.  Funny stuff.  And!  We even went exploring and found a new club that opened up.  It's called The Corner.  It has potential, although they need to promote more.  There wasn't very many people there.  Kinda slow to start, but there is definitely potential.  Anywhoo!  My fried chicken is calling my name.  Grub time!"

I really want chocolate ice cream, but since I have to save my money for my car payment, I can't go and get some.  I mean, yes, I normally want chocolate ice cream, but since I can't have it at this very moment, I'm jonesing more than usual.  Grr.  But seriously.  I've even applied this to real life stuff too.  Take for instance, my friend John.  He works with me at GHETC and he's such a sweetheart.  He knows I have a bf and he also has a gf, but he still continuously flirts with me.  He jokingly told me that my bf better be careful, cuz he's gonna steal me away from him one day.  It's not gonna happen, obviously, but it's still applicable.  Interesting stuff, huh?  Coincidence?  Maybe, maybe not..."

As if I made a little difference in someone's life.  Ophelia is making much progress in just two days.  She hasn't thrown herself on the ground since she first got to Good Hope, and she's more attentive too.  I'm really proud of her.  I mean, don't get me wrong, she is still quite the handful.  Sometimes I just want to tell someone else to watch her and then go slam my head on the wall, but if she can put up with me, I can certainly deal with her.  It's just a matter of us both understanding that I don't work with her, she works with me.  I hope she continues progressing.  She has such potential.  I can see it.  Now we have to get her to see it for herself.  ::sigh::  Time for bed now.  More work in the morning."

Maybe if everyone thought in those terms and had a more positive outlook in life, things would get better for everyone.  Anything can happen, but it's important to remember that every grey cloud has a silver lining.

"event","I just want to say that I love my job.  It's exhausting, but I still love it.  I mean, I get paid to play all day!  How great is that?!  Good times.

Today at work, we went to a Water Park.  It was uber fun.  All my girls are crazy though, but they are so cute.  However!  There was a slight complication.  There's this boy, Nick, who volunteers at the ranch and all the girls are absolutely IN LOVE with him.  So!  Everytime he came within ten feet of them, they went crazy and havoc ensued.  It was definitely an event and every five minutes, one of the girls would run off and Jess and I would have to run after them and drag them back.  Running after five little 11-year-old girls is a little tiring after a while.  And what made it worse is that Nick is always near me, cuz he kinda has a little crush on me.  

The part that complicates things is that the boy is 14!  And he knows I'm 19, but apparently, it doesn't matter to him cuz he constantly flirts with me.  I humor him sometimes, but I don't encourage him.  At first, I thought that I was overreacting, but on the bus ride back to Baptist Hospital, he asked to see my phone.  So I let him.  Then he changed my greeting  to ""I LUV NICK.""  Then he turned it off and said that he changed my greeting.  So I turned it back on and such and I saw it and I looked at him and kinda laughed and hit him and he smiled.  Oh the drama.  And now I have to worry about whether or not the girls in my group will hate me if they find out.  I know that sounds a little exaggerated, but do you people remember how we were in 6th grade?  How everything was life and death, black or white?  Yeah.  Here's hoping that they don't find out.

Anyways, I gotta go now.  I'm tired and I have to proof read James' essay.  Deuces."

There was this little girl, Sarae, who is soooooo cute.  I just want to put her in my pocket and carry her around with me.  So cute.  And!  I already found one of the little kids annoying.  No one really likes her.  I don't remember her name though.  But Jess and I were talking about wanting to kick her in the face.  Our reasoning was, just because a person is sick doesn't give them the right to be a shit head to everyone.  And I really have a lot of patience with children, but I couldn't handle being around her for more than a half an hour.  Everyone was complaining, but I guess she can't help it.  She's just a little kid after all.  Maybe tomorrow I'll actually get to ride a horse..."

"event","So!  I've decided to drop out of college and join the circus, because apparently I can't sign up for classes since I can't even get into the new PantherSoft system!  Grr...  I mean it lets me sign in, then it says that my password has expired and to change it.  Then a new window opens and it says the whole ""current password, new password, confirm new password"" bit.  Then as soon as the window finishes loading, BAM!  The ""window"" has expired.  What the crap is that?!?!  It's been 2 seconds.  No lie.  2 seconds.  I know that I'm prone to exaggeration, but I exaggerate you not.  I'm about fed up with FIU at this point.  ARGH!  ::throws hissy fit::  Okay.  I'm done."

"event","So!  I'm sitting here at home hanging out with Stacey and Jesse.  Nigel and his friend Larry came by a little while ago and Byron was here earlier.  Byron and Stacey wanted to watch The Butterfly Effect, so we did that too.  It was cool.  I'd already seen it though, and it was my second time watching it today, so I was indifferent for a chunk of it.  Other than that, it's been a really chill day.  Although I wish it didn't rain.  I really wanted to sit out in the jacuzzi for a bit.   Oh well!  There's always tomorrow.  Anywhoo!  I don't have anything else to say, but if I come up with anything else, I shall share!  hehehe.  See ya when I see ya!"

"event","So!  I went to the comedy show today, and it was soooooo funny.  I thought I was gonna piss myself.  I'm really glad that I got to go.  Sorry to all of those less fortunate.  I think I want to go to the next one, I believe it's in the beginning of September.  I'll have to do some research.  But anyways!!  There's gonna be a karaoke night at Gracie's on Tuesday, so I'mma see if anyone wants to go and do that.  I know that I wanna go!  Like that was a big surprise.  heheh.  Anywhoo!  I'm off to bed, cuz I have to go to class in the morning.  Grr...  But I'll live.  See ya when I see ya!"

"event","So!  I'm here at the library and I'm not doing much of anything.  I did what I came to do, so that's a plus.  Now I'm waiting for James to call me so we can go over to the ceramics building and work on our projects.  BUT!  I'm mad hungry and am half tempted to just go home and eat.  I know that I said that I would wait, but man!  I'm STARVING!!!  I'll try to stick it out, but no promises...  I need sustenance.  ::throws a hissy fit on the floor::"

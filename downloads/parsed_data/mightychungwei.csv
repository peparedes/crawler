"event","the time i would spend with pictures i would not send
i watched you go from left to right
i followed you all night across my blinds
making my peace
making it with distance
maybe that's a big mistake
you know i'm thinking of you
i miss you
you'll change your mind come monday and
turn your back on me
take your steps away with hesitance
take your steps away from me"

"event","It's raining. I like the rain. I want to go stand out in the rain. I tihnk i will. I hate pretending to be happy. This can't be healthy. I put myself through too much trouble. Sometimes I wish I could just leave. Leave everyting and just go somewhere and get away from everything I know and love and hate. I don't know where I would go, but i just would. Maybe for an hour. That's all I need is just to be alone somewhere far away for a little while. I hate this place. I hate everything about this place. I hate the smell, the look, the feel of this place. I hate the people always watching and criticizing, always telling me what to do, how to feel, how not to feel. How to act. How to be. I don't want it anymore. you can have it. I can't trust this place. Make it stop. Please make it stop.....

"event","Hey, I haven't really written in this before, but I think I'm going to do it more often. Did that make any sense? Anyways...There's this situation I'm in, I haven't spoken to me real father in over 7 years. But for some reason i decided i wanted to email him, so i did. And it's kinda cool, but at the same time, it's kinda weird. Like, he started telling my all this stuff about him, what he's doing, and it's really interesting, but at the same time it's wierd. He's a really famous musician in Canada (that's where he lives)and 3 different radio stations play his stuff like every 90 minute. He does a tribute to Led Zepplin and he does it pretty well, too. But anyways, I found out that I have a 14 month old half sister named Mackenzie and she looks just like me. It's a little creepy. He wants me to call him, but I don't think I'm quite comfortable with that yet. I dunno. 

He told me he loves me. 
How can he love me if he doesn't know me?

I just think that he's trying to hard to try and become my dad. He's never been my dad. He never will be my dad. He'll always just be Michael. 






Some people who loose their dads and never get them back would do anytihng to have them back. I have a chance to have mine back, and I don't think I want him. 


Like I said, I'm confused."

"event","So i don't know what i'm going to do. I really enjoy photography, but i don't i want to go all the way to Santa Barbara, i think for many different reasons. Number one of course, i dont want to leave Michelle or Thomas. Number two, i don't really have the money. And number three, i don't know if i want to major in photography. I think that would be totally awesome if i could travel the world as a photo journalist for national goegraphic, like I've always wanted to do. But on the other hand, the most important thing in the world to me is family, and if i can't be with my family for 6-8 months out of the year, then, i guess i'm pretty shit out of luck, huh? I think that in maybe a year or so i might want to go and take a session or so of photo journalism. But...i dunno. I really dont know what to do. If i tell that to the admissions representitive, then he won't write me the letter of recomendation that i need to get in at all. kjasbdga ijerh glaiuegr . so there. take that. yeah. alkrjehgq;rjhbq; orhy b. what now?

"event","I don't know why, but i suddenly feel really crappy. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend Thomas, and i was fine before i called him, but now, i dunno. All my happy is gone. Where has all my happy gone? Sometimes i just feel like i should be upset with him, but i don't know why yet. That's been happening a lot lately. I get upset with him, but i'm not sure why. And i don't know who I'm writing this too, because most likely nobody will read this. Personally i can't stand to listen too people complain about their personal lives,so why would anyone want to listen to me complain about mine? He is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and i love him, but i need my right arm. Michelle! I need my right arm! I miss her."

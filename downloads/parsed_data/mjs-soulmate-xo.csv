"event","<font style=""font-family:Tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;	color:black; font-size:9;"">This journal is now <u>Friends Only</u>. <i><b><font style= color:#F56A94;""> Unfortunately</font></b></i> I have no choice but to make it like that for now. Which sucks because I never wanted my journal to be friends only and <i><b><font style= color:#F56A94;""> hate</font></i></b> the feeling of being restricted in expressing myself. But because of the circumstances all entries have been locked for now. Of course once I've figured out how to go about it I will make this public again. I guess I haven't been updating in ages anyway though but that will change soon and I will be updating ALOT!
So for now, anyone who wants to view my journal just comment and add me and I will add you straight back! :)</font>

"event","OK, well my LJ has kind of been abandoned lol. So much has been going on. & the fact that my computer was broken for like, 7 months make it harder to update lol. But it's FINALLY been fixed!!! It feels sooo great to have it working again.
I'm not making any promises but I will deffinetly be updating sometime really SOON with a long ass update of what's been happening & how things are.

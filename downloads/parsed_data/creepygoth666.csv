I've taken him to the vet twice because of a past abscess and his thyroid, and his monthly thyroid medication, and Akasha just went last week, so I'm tapped out on money.

His back leg has started to swell, so I  know there's probably a bacterial infection or an abscess. I cleaned it out with warm, soapy water, rubbing alcohol, and covered it in honey, and I made him lick some off my finger as a sort of antibacterial/antibiotic kind of thing. I'm really hoping this works. If anyone else has some home remedies they'd like to share, please go ahead and do so!"

Soundwave. <i>Oh my god, <b>Soundwave</b></i>. Him and Laserbeak were such total badasses and I am going to squee so hard and repeat Bolts here: SO FUCKING HOT. Oh my god. BUT Y U DIE, SOUNDWAVE? Y U DO DIS TO ME? QAQ *hugs WFC Soundwave*

I would've cried so hard at the deaths of Ironhide and Soundwave if it wasn't for the fact Sean was with me and I wasn't currently ""What the FUCK."" raging over the lack of reaction/emotion from anyone over 'Hide's death and total nonchalance at their planet being fucking destroyed. OH HAI CYBERTRON, DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU! Lalalala! :D""

Speaking of - anyone else get that reference/nod to Cosmic Rust with his death? FFFF. 

AND MEGATRON YOU NARCISSISTIC BASTARD. Lookit you gloatin' on your stone Lincoln chair. LOL Y U IMMITATIN' YO' G1 SELF?

Also in response to a few people raging over Carly's speech to Megatron at the near end - It's actually plausible. I mean, I'm sure Sam's told her oodles about the decepticons and Megatron and what not, and given his personality it's not that hard to play off of and feed that over-confident, proud, dominating personality of his. It doesn't really take a genius to know how to manipulate that. 

WHERE THE FUCK WAS SILVERBOLT.

WHAT THE FUCK WAS WITH QUE. CHANGE THE HEAD AND I SWEAR, YOU HAD WHEELJACK. Y U FUCK WITH US, BAY?

WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST KEEP DINO AS MIRAGE? >:( 

.....WHY THE FUCK DID ROADBUSTER AND LEADFOOT SPEAK BUT TOPSPIN DIDN'T? You obviously can give two out of three wreckers a personality, but not the third?

All in all I really enjoyed the film. I will probably pirate it until it comes out on DVD to watch over and over and try to catch things i missed. OH AND ALSO. It's not TOO 3D-ish or whatever, but you can seriously tell it was shot using the camera. It really does create depth and a sense of immersion into the surroundings and each scene, that I really liked. It wasn't overwhelming, other than a few animation things that had me going, ""Dear god, my seat doesn't recline far enough for me to see it properly!"" and cursing the lack of glasses-friendly Real3D glasses out there for these kinds of movies.</lj-cut>"

colors used were SHIRO COSMETICS in Charmander, Pikachu (mixed inner corner); Hearts (outer corner/crease); Concrete Minerals in Napalm (middle lid blended into inner and outer corners; under eye) which is a really awesome bright ass orange with a gold undertone; and Shiro Cosmetics Subrosia for a liner. 

You guys should check these cosmetic stores out :D Concrete Minerals gives you a ten-gram jar full of product for like..5.99 for full size, and their samples are the five-gram jars which is huge for..I don't know how much. But it's awesome. And Shiro? Geekiness and really smooth, easily blendable colors that you don't need a primer or a base for. Love love love these two companies.

""Hark,"" I exclaim, ""That voice! I know that voice! That throaty, english accent, it calls to me!""

So torn between the actor who plays Shockwave and the actor who plays Sark, I hit up good ol' IMDB. It's Sark. David Fuckin' Warner. hell yeah.

I scrolled through the rest of the cast, and I must admit; I'm shocked. A lot of these characters are played by well known actors. Frank Welker, for one. :D David Kaufman, Ricardo Montalban (Classic movie actor, for those who don't know, such as Naked Gun)..Spielberg did a great job with this cartoon. :D I wish it would've had more seasons/episodes."

I've noticed, while listening to my playlist (i literally just put my whole music folder into winamp and hit random), that dark or suspenseful instrumentals strike a chord with how I've read, and seen, Megatron portrayed. Old 80's/early 90's rap (Such as Beastie Boys) always reminds me of Rumble/Frenzy. Mindless Self Indulgence songs remind me of Zim, for some reason.

Friday night was the Green 17 Tour concert. Twopointeight, a band from Sweden, were the openers and they did an awesome job. Definitely going to have to find a site where I can get a cd or download music from. Then there was Street Dogs, who the lead singer was the singer from Dropkick Murphy's. And then of course, FLOGGING MOLLY. Omg. The balconies were shaking so bad from everyone bouncing and dancing along, I thought we were gonna get smooshed. 

All in all, I had so much fun. <3

He was adorable, for the short week we had had him. All of us had gotten attached, and would laugh at how his ears flopped all around when he chased the cats around the living room, or how he'd look like Gizmo (the gremlin) when he stood on his hind legs.

My sister's devastated. It wasn't her fault, either, he had just gotten sick yesterday and we all didn't try to force enough water into him. My sister tried so hard though, giving him two baths yesterday to clean him up and changing his cage bedding several times; forcing water into him for a while..and he had seemed to be getting better.

The 44 year old had left behind a Wife, Terri, an eight year old daughter Bindi Sue, and a three year old son Bob, as well as adoring fans world wide. He died doing what he loved, and I'm sure he wouldn't have had it any other way. 

Conservation has lost a very dear friend, and I hope that, even though he's gone, that message he tried to express about respecting nature and it's less loved, scale-y members (who I personally adore..I love reptiles).

While I was there, I saw the most gorgeous kingsnake baby, and I have made it my sole mission, should I be able to afford it (after getting a liscense and my GED and getting into college and such) that I will have that snake. I got to hold it and just..aww. I was in love. 

Out of all the snakes they had there, I wanted that one. 

Well, my sister comes home today with a baby albino cornsnake, ((illegally bought, I might add-she had to be 18 to get it, and the guy who sold it to her got fired because he didn't card her or Mike)) and I love it, but everytime I go to touch it, I panic and end up pulling away. I don't know why I do this, I just do..I never did that with the king snake. That beauty even bit me, and I loved it even more. But the cornsnake...something about it just scares me, and I am /NOT/ afraid of snakes.

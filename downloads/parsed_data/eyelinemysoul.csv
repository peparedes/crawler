I paid my share for lunch in my last quarters that were reserved for tokens in my theatre to play Tekken.  My last bills (7 pluse a dollar in quarters) went to gas yesterday (and today my gas is back where it was from before I went to the gas station).

Good thing I get a paycheck this weekend (maybe two depending on Rob at Great Steak)... I also finally set up my ebay seller's account.  I just need to figure out shipping and then I can start up an auction for my shit (and believe me, it's shit.)

I am very sore... just from trying to get my boomerang to work yesterday.  That shows how out of shape I am.  

Yesterday, Chris, Pegg, Russell, and I went to the aquarium to see the otters.  That's where the rest of my money went.

Pegg's engagement ring is very pretty and shiny.

Chris and I started looking at apartments... even though we can't afford one at the moment.  At least we can look.  Looking makes me very excited, though.. mostly because we're serious about it.  The fact that we are serious about moving in together puts most paranoia aside.  Money is our only issue... and probably will be for awhile.

I'm planning on getting one more job.  Chris is getting a job and already has some money set aside for us... Also, unlike me, he doesn't have any debts to pay off.
I still have to pay my parents for my car and the trip to NYC.
I have to pay tuition, too... but my parents are helping me with that for awhile.
I have to start paying my cell phone bill next year, but I'll worry about that then... (not like it will be much since I never use the thing.)

From now on, you can read about me here:  <lj user=""asesina_tuya"">
Friend me if you want to, don't if you don't.
A few words of caution:  I will be hiding nearly nothing.  The journal is me mostly naked (that's metaphorical.  Do not go and expect to see naked pictures of me.).

I knew he would decide to just get up and leave... That's why I locked him up.  I tried to prevent him from leaving and breaking my heart.  A broken heart is the most excruciating pain.  It's unlivable.  Each and every Female Species in my family has died of the Broken Heart Virus.  Such a painful thing to watch.

I saw my mother die of it nine years ago.  My Step-father slapped her across the face and stormed out the front door.  Her death didn't take place until a week later, but you could see her chest caving in dangerously.  Her heart was deteriorating and her ribs tried to protect it still, but they ended up crushing her lungs.  The autopsy also said her stomach had been tied into knots and empty for days.  The process was complete when she knew he wasn't coming back.

I am to meet the same fate as my mother, now... and as my grandmother before her... and her mother before her... Why couldn't he have stayed in the cage?  I would have never ever set him on fire, but I believe that is what he feared...  That or the fact that Female Species murders their mates after Reproductive Games.  I wouldn't have murdered him, though.  I'm different.  Really, I am.  I've trained myself to be superior to Species and Species Way of Life.  I am what they shall evolve to be.  They are The End!  I am The Beginning!  And I need <i>him</i> to come back to make History.

The Fire Gift is uncommon among Species.  Fire Gift shows that I have spoken to the Gods and they rained Evolution upon me... Couldn't he see that?  Couldn't he see how special I am?  Why did he escape?

"event","I opened concession today by myself and was alone in the stand my whole shift until the last half hour.  Business was incredibly slow, but you can't expect a large turnout when school is in session.  My only customers were a few elderly, a stay-at-home-mom with some kids, a young couple, and a few men in their mid-twenties.  I do not believe I served more than fifteen people, but I am not positive.  I only signed my register report... I didn't look over it.

Because business was so slow and we were having a sneak preview of <i>Vanity Fair</i> this evening, I was told to pop more popcorn.  We were down to our last bag.  Of course, when I am working by myself, the popper has to act up.  First, when I tipped it over to let the popcorn out of the kettle, the lid fell off.  Chuck had to put it back on for me.  Then, not more than ten minutes later, the oil ran out.  I didn't know what was wrong with the popper... I don't use it that often.  I tried popping a few batches, but it wouldn't pop much... and eventually what did pop, burned a little bit (but it wasn't burned so horribly that I wouldn't be able to bag it).  During this time, I had kept talking to Chuck over the radio and saying that the popper was acting up.  He didn't believe me and told me to just wait and listen for it... and to ignore the beeping.  Eventually, I decided to quit popping and let Chuck look at it when he came around the concession stand again.  It was a good hour of bagging pre-made popcorn conversing with Fred spent before Chuck came by again.

""Did you give up on popping?""
""It was scaring me.""
""What's it doing?... Oh.. wow.  That's burnt.  Maybe it's out of oil.""

He checked the oil, and as I said, it was out.  So he lugged a barrel of oil from the back to the front of the concession stand.  He told me that he needed my help putting it in the popper... I attempted to help, but we ended up spilling oil all over the floor.  He then decided to do it himself.  At least the popper popped from then on.

Popping problems do not end there, though.  A little bit later, the popper decides it does not want to keep the lid closed.  This is because who ever closed last night did not reassemble the popper properly after they cleaned it.  We have two poppers and the lids have stickers that show you which lid is supposed to go on which popper...  I do not mind some of the people I work with, but I have to admit... They are not the brightest people in the world.  They had the lid that was supposed to go on the left popper on the right popper and vice versa.  I already knew this, but I had not paid any attention to it because previously when the popper lids were reversed, I did not have problems such as these.

Randy was in the stand a few times when I was having problems with the popper lid, and so he decided he would try to make it so it would stay closed.  When it happened again, he got fed up with it and decided to switch the lids and put them on properly.  One of the times I was having problems with the lid, I had a customer who decided to give me a dollar tip ""because you look like you're having a bad day"".  That was very nice of him.  The remaining hours of my shift, I had a dollar in my shoe.

I spent my last half hour filling ice bins and baths while the other person took over on the popping.

When I arrived home, I discovered that someone had taken a key to the passenger side of Robby.  Bastards.  I don't know when it happened.  I didn't drive Robby today and I don't know when it appeared.  The last time I drove Robby was on Sunday... and my father was confused because when he drives Robby, the car is outside his office's window.  That means it most likely happened in the parking garage at work.

The nice deeds that one person does, cannot fix my hatred of humanity.  People will always do crap that outweighs the not-so-crap.  Stupid people."

<i>The Village</i> was not good at all.  I heard rumors that it was bad, but I had no idea that they would be so accurate.  It would definitely make a better book.  I didn't expect a horror film... I expected suspense... but I didn't even get that.

We came back to my house and watched <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> and then he showed me the present he made that required internet access.  It's a poem and I enjoy it much.

Tomorrow I have my appointment with my advisor and then Shadowbox Cabaret.  The third installment of <a href=""http://ghostie.150m.com"">Point Ghostie</a> will probably go up tomorrow afternoon.

Friday I'm seeing a movie with my Christopher, Russell and Pegglet... and then Saturday I'm meeting Chris at Kings Island.  I get to see Chris three times within four days!  Sunday I go back to work.  Joyous."

"event","Work started off slow... but then during matinee time, 173 people hit me at the concession stand.  I was the only one working concession for my shift and I got behind with the orders pretty quickly.  Randy had to come back and help me for ten of those 15 minutes that I was being mobbed.  Also during that time, I had construction workers behind the concession stand too, and they had a large tube that I had to jump over and crawl under to get some of what I needed.  It was crazy for a bit.  After that, though, the theater was dead.

After work, Fred challenged me to a game of Tekken.  I haven't played in so long.  He won, but I told him I want a rematch next time we work together.  I'm going to train hard for next time.  Fred is a cool kid.  He and I talked about video games most of the day.  He's an usher and just stands at the pole taking tickets most of the time.  I enjoy the majority of the people I work with.  The young ones though, the girls who are under 17... They drive me crazy.  I want to strangle them.  They are fingernails on a chalkboard.

Also, Jill (<lj user=""fallen_roses"">) gave me my birthday present (Media Play gift card and Pop Rocks)... and then not long after, I spilled my dinner all over my bedroom floor.  I now have a mashed potato stain right next to my computer chair.  Lovely.

I thought someone had been locked out of the house, and so I went down the stairs to investigate.  To my surprise, it was a complete stranger.  I opened the door because he had already seen me and he asked me, ""Is there anyone in this house over 18 that I could speak to?""

Me: ""I'm 18.""
Him:  ""Are you <i>really</i>?""
Me:  ""Yeah.""
Him:  ""Well, okay.  I'm looking for some nonviolent people that will sponsor me in the [insert function's name here].  Are you a violent person?""
Me:  ""I could be.""
Him: [nervous] ""Well... would you like to.. <i>blah blah blah</i> [hands me a card with scribbles].""
Me:  ""What do you want me to do?  Get to the point.""
Him:  ""Well, you should first help me out here and get excited and ask me about <i>blah blah blah</i>.""
Me:  ""Kid, I just woke up.  I'm not excited about anything.""
Him:  ""Well... Look here and check off your favorite magazines.""
Me:  ""I don't like <i>any</i> magazines... and there's no way I'd buy one just so you can do whatever.  I can hardly afford to live.  Go away.""
Him:  ""Are you sure?  You get a student prices <i>blah blah blah</i>-""
Me:  ""Kid, I said, 'no'.  Go the fuck away."" [slams door]

That's what you get for being a stranger at my door asking for my money right when I wake up.

I went to work at six.  I was the only one there for two hours.  Vernon came in at 8:00.  He's fun to work with.  He thinks I'm the weirdest person in the world, but he told me that I'm his favorite person to work with.  Apparently I'm fun.  Because we don't get a lot of customers, I tend to goof off a bit at work.  Anything to pass the time.  Tomorrow, I'm alone for my whole shift.  Glorious.  I get to open by myself."

I was not one to go home early because I was cut yesterday.  I really hope business picks up... I don't want to be without a job again.  After Tuesday, I don't work again until Sunday.  Thursday my sister is taking me to Shadowbox Cabaret, Wednesday is Christopher day, and I guess Friday I'll be meeting with my advisor to register for my classes.  I have to call him tomorrow to schedule an appointment.

I have two paychecks and a birthday check I need to cash sometime...  I still need to get my last check from Great Steak.  How long is it supposed to be before they mail it to you?  I also still need to tell them that I have problems with my first paycheck from there.. and I need to cash that.  Somehow, I don't think I'll ever tell them and I'll just end up accepting the fact that my pay was cut ten hours worth.

Thanks to Christopher, I got an idea for <a href=""http://ghostie.150m.com"">Point Ghostie</a>.  Depending upon when I wake up tomorrow, the strip might be up before I go to work at six.  Also, expect a new layout for it soon as well.  Pegg, <lj user=""ohsadness"">, has made me a new one.  I like her HTML skills better than mine (mostly because mine are practically nonexistant).

Why is it that I have nothing interesting to say anymore?  Have I really dried myself out of words... or are my emotions just too calm to surface any worthy writings?  I think I may be digging deep someday soon."

"event","Today has had to be my least ""special"" birthday.  Last year, I was at least treated to a free movie (<i>Freddy Vs. Jason</i> to be exact)... This year, I was treating the world to free movies... and a popcorn/drink/candy combo for two dollars.

My first birthday present of the day was a white nametag that notifies everyone that I am no longer a minor.

Work was insanely busy.  We had a line that went down to Bigg's for tickets the majority of the day.  We sold out of the 500 buckets of cotton candy I spent all day yesterday making by 4:00 (we opened at ten) and the last movie that was not sold out, sold out by 6:20.

I saw a few people that I know.  Tina (she graduated the year before me), and Erica were both in town (I think they both live in California now because they do some performance thing).  I was also visited by Jill (<lj user=""fallenroses"">) and her friend(s).  They bought things from me!

At the end of the day, Mr. Hahn told me that my drawer came up 21.04 short.  I almost had a heart attack.  He double-checked it and said that I was only 1.01 short.  Really, I was only 0.01 short because I was 1.00 short to begin with.  I wonder if he ever remembered that... or found my note that I left informing that I started off 1.00 short.

After work, I discovered a Halloween store in the mall.  I was excited... and I'm still excited.  A Halloween store... and it's not even September/October yet.  I didn't look around much, but from what I saw their merchandise wasn't too great... but I'll keep checking.

Rosemary didn't let me drive to work today because she took the day off and needed the car.  She picked me up and brought me home to the rest of my lovely family.  I changed my clothes and we went to Skyline (without my brother because he had Shaolin do).  We came home, Mike (my sister's husband) came over, we ate cake (I wasn't allowed to blow out the candles in case of mono contamination) and I opened my gifts.

Mike and Tammy: The Cure: Bloodflowers shirt
Danny: <i>Wicked</i> by Gregory Maguire
Rosemary and Father: Ankh necklace charm and a strange necklace that I will never wear.  I'll put the ankh on the chain.  They also gave me 18.00 in singles.

After we ate cake and such I've just been sitting at my computer, reading <i>Fight Club</i> and talking to Chris.  Yep.  I'm 18 years old and I still do nothing... I should runaway... They can't bring me back."

"event","I picked up Chris this morning.  We went to Tri-County to pick up my last paycheck from Great Steak and to talk to Rob about my previous paycheck, but he told me, ""I can't give it to you now.  Come back later.""  I really do hate that man.  From a reader's perspective, you wouldn't understand, and it's hard to make you understand.  But if you met the man, slight understanding would cross your mind.  From Great Steak we went to FYE and I bought Beth's birthday present (Tristania CD: World of Glass because I was supposed to make her a copy of my Tristania mix about a year ago and never did).  Afterwards, we headed back to my house and eventually met up with Beth.  She and I exchanged gifts (she gave me Hellsing manga number two) and then I drove us all to eat Chinese.  I received the best fortune cookie ever:  ""Stop searching forever.  Happiness is just next to you.""  Of course Chris was sitting next to me.  That moment made me so happy that I almost cried... over a fortune cookie.  It was just a surreal moment... something that doesn't happen in everyday life.

After we ate lunch, we came back to my house so I could take my medication and we watched <i>Amelie</i> (my second time seeing it... this week and in general).  Then we went to Michael's Billiards and played three games of pool (I won two, Chris won one, Beth zero).  After that we travelled to Taco Bell.  Beth got very excited because a skank came in and she wanted me to take a picture.  The button of my camera wouldn't push while we were throwing our garbage away, but after we walked outside, they convinced me to go back and take a picture.  I felt stupid running back in and taking the picture, so I walked around to the side and tried to take the picture through the window.  Skank was watching me, though, and when I had the camera ready, she ducked out of sight.

I should have ran back inside and snapped a quick shot.  I'll kick myself for being such a chicken.

We left Taco Bell and came back to my house.  Beth left and I took Chris back to Big Lots.  This was the first time I have ever taken him to Big Lots and left alone... and in the dark.  It's really hard to drop him off.  Everyday I'm with him it gets harder to say goodbye.  It's silly, but it's true.  I strongly believe that he's who I'm going to be with for the rest of my life... but I still rarely ever know when I'll see him next... and if I ever do know, that day is usually a week (sometimes more) away.  But I know that he and I belong together.  Wyrd.  Fate.  We're meant to be.  One day, we won't have to say goodbye... and I'll see him everyday after I come home from work.  I'll be able to cry into his shoulder when my emotions get so messed up I can't handle them.  I'll be able to actually feel his embrace instead of having to remember feeling it... One day.  It will happen."

I originally thought that this year I would have something to look forward to.  Apparently I was wrong... or at least continuing my existence in my dream world.

I most likely won't be seeing Chris on my birthday.  I haven't seen him since The Cure concert because of the monkey.  I was supposed to see him yesterday, but my parents decided last minute that it would be in my best interest not to pick him up and I went to the doctor's office and the hospital instead.  At least he enjoyed his evening.

Also, my best and one of two friends is moving into her dorm this weekend.  I was going to help her and I really wanted to... but because of my work schedule, I can't.  Her birthday is Saturday and I won't see her then... and I probably won't see her on my birthday.  If I wasn't working this weekend, I would also be visiting her grandmother.  I take her grandmother as my own.  I love her to death... and I wanted to stay up there for a weekend like we had when we worked at RenFaire.

If it hadn't been for the monkey, I would take Friday and Saturday off.  But I've already taken four days off... and I really need the hours I am being given this weekend.

Hopefully I can see both Chris and Beth on Tuesday.

My birthday (and weekend) shall go as this:
I'll be sick.
I'll be working.
Work will be insanely busy.
I'll be dead when I come home from work.
I won't have Christopher to cuddle with and make me feel better.
I won't have Beth to talk to.
I won't see Grandma.
I won't get Grandma's cinnamon rolls.
I'll be dead tired this week because of my insane amount of work hours.

When Beth leaves Cincinnati, I will officially have no local friends.
Lovely.  That means I will have to ""make plans"" ahead of time more than usual.  No last minute ""You want to do something's"" and no more ""How about that coffee house's""...

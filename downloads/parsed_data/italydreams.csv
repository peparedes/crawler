some people just dont see the lies they tell,
and some just dont see whats in front of them.
but i guess people change,
they can make the same mistakes over agin,
because they refuse to say no
and refuse to learn.

Its old, HighSchools almost over, Were about to be 
thrown into the world. How do you plan on handling that?"

no, we cant. but it is a nice thing to gogle at..i must admit.


I want someone. I want someone that will play with my hair. Someone that says I love you even when the timing is all wrong. Someone that doesn't just say I love you without meaning it. Someone that will send me a text messge at 3 in the morning to see if I'm still awake. Someone that comes inside. Someone that comes to my window. Someone that doesn't care if my legs are shaved that day. Someone that worries. Someone that has stupid thoughts but isn't afraid of sharing them. Someone who can keep up with me. Someone who is in a good mood as much as I am. Somone that isn't afraid of what i'll think. Someone that wants me back. Someone that only sees me. Someone that isn't afraid to tell me how they feel. Someone that doesn't agree with everything I say. Someone that will tease me. Someone that doesn't only want sex. Someone that I can have a conversation with. Someone that's always there for me. Someone that loves watching late night reality tv. Someone that would just cuddle. Someone sweet. Someone funny. Someone as goofy as I am. Someone to love."

"event","I should be happy, i should be thrilled, and excited.
But im not.
Its not suposed to be this way, but it is.
He wont open up to me.
He wont talk to me, he wont trust me.
He just shuts me off, and i cant deal with that.
I like him so much, i do, so so much. but its turning out
, well not like it should. Im so worried about him, he needs to know
how much i care, and he has to let me in, or i just might go away.
and i cant even tell if he'd be effected. And maybe i want someone 
to be excited to see me, or miss me , or just want to show me off to his friends
just be proud that im his, cuz i dont get that vibe. I dont get that feeling. 
I need that feeling. Rite now, i need that feeling, of wholeness and comepleteness, and
safeness, and just secure, wanted, loved, beautiful, i need someone who really really cares
because i give all of that , at least all i can , and i just for once, want to feel it... to have it.
i dont want him to just be satisfied with me, i want him to feel happy with me, and 
want to be with me because he wants to whole heartedly, not just 
because he doesnt want to be alone.
i need so much more than that,
maybe i ask for to much. 
do i?
I dunno. Maybe i am.

I talked to Jim today, its been awhile. Might hang out with him for old times sake ."

It will NEVER go away, and its just going to build and build, always haunting me. You cant forget something thats written in red ink on your wrist. How did that become me? How is THIS me? I have failed as a human being. Ive let everyone down, hurt them, what kinda fucking person am i? It burns."

"event","She seen trust in all of me, stretched across my shame. 
All the torment and the pain 
Leaked through the cover in me 
Id do anything ever to myself 
Just to have her for myself 
Now I dont know what to do, I dont know what to do when she makes me sane. 

She is everything to me 
The unaquited dream 
A song that no one sings 
The unobtainable, Shes a myth that I have to believe in 
All I need to make it real is one more reason 
I dont know what to do, I dont know what to do when she makes me sane. 

But I wont let this build up inside of me 
I wont let this build up inside of me 
I wont let this build up inside of me 
I wont let this build up inside of me 

A catch in my throat 
Choke, dawn into pieces I wont 
No, I dont want to be this 

But I wont let this build up inside of me 
I wont let this build up inside of me 
I wont let this build up inside of me 
I wont let this build up inside of me 

She isnt real 
I can make her real 
She isnt real 
I can make her real"

"event","I went to my first Job Interview Today at Jo-Ann's. I have the Job but i wont know my schedual until thursday, friday or monday...yay....

The last few days have been pretty hecktict for me. 
I read Sarahs Journal entry for today, made me feel 
awful. Im not sure what to do now. I hate it, Shit's 
always fucked up. Just for once i would like things to work out.

I realized yesterday that things wont ever be the same. They cant be.
No matter how much we pretend, or want it. It can NEVER be the same agin.
And i realized, I have myself, and thats it. I guess its going to have to be 
good enough for me. 

I had a dream last night , it scared me. It happend agin, ( in my dream ) Scars every where. I wish mine would go away. O why did i have to be that way? Why me? I just want to be happy, and to love life. It's just so hard. I want to stop all this medication and bullshit, its not me. Its not me at all. 

I get my Drivers Lics. July 7th, not too much longer thank god. As soon as work starts I'll be pulling 40 hours a week, good for money. I'm going to buy a video camera, and then just put it away, minus the money i have to spend on gas and insurance.

I need to talk to Jeremy. 
I just need to know some things.

I was suposed to go to New Orleans this weekend, it got canceld.
O well, Ill go July 9th now. 
Pew. I need to go do something to get my mind off things.
God i hate all this shit.
I feel so bad now. 
but is it even fair?"

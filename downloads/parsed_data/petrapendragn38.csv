"event","It was warm today, almost like summer. I wore sandals most of the morning. Gilbert has been in a good mood all day, even though he's had little to eat. I envy him. He is very much the way I would like to be. He is quite bold and faces anything without batting an eye. He is also very articulate in his way, and always expresses himself charmingly in ""words"" that are very pleasing. And he isn't afraid to play. I remember I used to like to play. But these days I have grown selfish, and I'm always thinking that others will take advantage of me if I have too much fun. I don't know when this tightness crept in. Not long ago someone was discussing roots of bitterness and why they might take hold in the first place. I don't believe that I'm bitter, but perhaps something like it. There must be something I am holding on to that makes it so difficult to enjoy little things. It seems the only time I enjoy myself is with children or animals, and then only because I imagine them too innocent to ""use my fun against me."" My, how very neurotic I am becoming, and how very sad it will be to go on like this much longer."

"event","A great song is playing and I just got tidy after my third successful run this week! Hooray. My hilarious ex-boss called today to update me on her personal life, which was pleasant, since she is such a jolly sort of person. And I watched Whale Rider earlier today. It was rather nice, the idea of someone unlikely wanting and deserving a job that no one else wants or is fit for. I find that whenever I come across someone who is particularly fit for a task, it conjures vague ideas of Jesus Christ. Not in a creepy, blasphemous sort of way, but just as a way of understanding what it means that He was completely unique in His fittedness for the task set before Him. I got this feeling from watching Children of Men and from lots of books I've read, most obviously from Bros. Karamazov and Sir Gibbie. 
I also watched Paradise Now yesterday afternoon. Man, but that was sad! And not the satisfying sort of sad that makes me weep. Nope, this was the opposite of the messianic undertones of those other books and movies, a pity, squandered beauty and potential, all for a sort of counterfeit purpose. But I liked the movie itself. It explains why a certain sort of despair would bloom into an embracing of that same old oblivion that haunts so many lives. It's that nihilism that seems to skulk in the corner of the mind to scavenge. I recently saw a familiar image of an emaciated African infant crouching with his head on the floor, while a vulture sits a stone's throw away, waiting to move in. It is horrendous beyond words, but it captures a reality that is hard to imagine on a la-dee-dah day like today. We aren't the lords and ladies of creation that we fancy ourselves. Perhaps that was the idea once, and perhaps one day that will be restored and then some. But today we are unfathomably feeble, with a mere breath between us and that oblivion. I just read a blog on the South Korean hostages. The author was questioning whether dealing with terrorists was the best course of action...Its funny that we can get stuck in that sort of thinking. I know that my reaction is to pick up a shotgun and blow away every vulture in sight, but its quite a stupid one. Suffering is certainly our birthright as children of God, and as the followers of Christ. But it is baffling to watch others suffer, if we fail to make the connection to that ultimate enemy, and conversely, that ultimate advocate. I still forget, and my metaphorical shotgun is all too cocked and ready to rip things to shreds, I'm afraid. But slowly, slowly, the mud on my eyes cracks a bit, and lets the teeniest bit of light stream in now and again, thank God."

"event","I just got back from a marvelous little run. I had a headache and decided to work it off, so I took off at a rather ambitious pace up El Camino, doubting if I could keep it up very long. So I was rather pleased when I made my usual circuit with little huffing and puffing and NO lung discomfort. That little drizzle earlier today must have sweetened our usually murky air. Anyhow, that must have been one of the fastest jaunts I've been on, aside from the horrible first Turkey Trot and the recent teen team fiasco.
Yesterday's little shindig was rather pleasant, if smaller than anticipated. After all, whenever an event is AT HOME I rather expect it to be comfortable and cheery than exciting. Although one of the cousins DID show up in a catwoman-like outfit, heehee.
Well, now both sisters have gone, but I can't be sad because the bedrooms are so clean that they make me feel a bit of a glow of satisfaction. Thanks, Mo, for the cleaning coaching! Maybe you could make thousands being a life coach, whatever that is..."

"event","I spent the day at Chuck-E-Cheese's today. What a strange place! Not as strange as some, and not at all unpleasant to anyone in relatively good health and humor(the kids and their noise, erratic movements, germs, and such might prove too much for the faint of heart). Lately, I have noticed that I spend a large percentage of my time with children, and I'm not quite sure why. One individual, who currently resides in that no man's land that is adolescence, was kind enough to point out that I don't hang out with people my own age. This isn't completely true, but like all half-truths, it did its work and made me self-conscious about the rather unbalanced nature of the demographics of my associates. It's actually a little amusing, because I'm not the sort to say ""I love kids"" or to get misty-eyed about the little critters. 
In truth, I feel a bit relieved when all the other grown ups are gone and I can say what I'm thinking, and have the ""young people""(as one teacher calls them) respond in kind. The other day I was having a wretched morning, having cut my sleep prematurely short and rolled up and out grumpily. I was being short and snippy with the kids, and my patience was sadly lacking. Finally, I blurted out, ""I need to get out of here."" One little girl, aged 10, immediately answered, ""Yes, you do. You're all short and rude this morning!"" This little girl is chronically rude and irreverent herself, and my first impulse was to blast her for her impudence. But the moment passed, and I chuckled internally as it slid by. 
There is something rejuvenating and restorative about acknowledging a weakness, a flaw, a sin, or a mistake, and having someone testify to it as well. After my inadvertent confession and my little companion's subsequent testimony, my morning steadily improved. The point is, I begin to realize that I don't love kids as much as I should, but I do appreciate the affect they have upon me! They make me nuts half the time, and the rest of the time I find myself wishing I were more like them. 
Whenever one of them gives me a compliment(which they do almost constantly, God bless them), I feel inspired to thank them and thank God, rather than congratulate myself. Similarly, when they criticize, I find the responsibility rests squarely on my own shoulders. It's the strangest thing! Even their insincere flattery makes me squirm in discomfort, as though they had read my mind and revealed my own pettiness. Lies from them, or unkindness,or sullen defiance, or filthy language, makes me burn with indignation, as though someone had snapped a lovely sapling in two, or poisoned their milk, and tried to make me a party to it. 

Unfortunately, I haven't learned to express these thoughts and emotions quite fluently yet at opportune moments. Very often I just get mad, or frustrated, or discouraged about what I see. But I think I'm learning to be thankful, and to set more store on prayer and good will than on correct answers and clean finger nails. Also, I am remembering what I once knew instinctively: that love, real love, is bestowed before approval. That's a hard truth for me to believe, and a harder one for me to emulate. But I rest easy, knowing that I have the best of teachers. To His credit, He is even more determined to teach me my lessons than I am to learn them."

Still, I must admit that these warm days are lovely, and that the familiar scents and impressions that come with the warm weather are heartening in an ever-astounding way. I came home from class tonight and headed out for a nighttime walk with the folks. It was marvelous, with a fine view of the city lights below us, and a legion of crickets seranading us all the way. Is it possible not to hope and dream of wonderful possibilities in such pleasant pastures? I know not. I do know that it is wonderful to bask in the sunshine I didn't even know I craved!

"event","It seems to be in the wind, this prompting to set aside lethargy and join the land of the living. Today was a beautiful day, with plenty of sunshine and just the right amount of wind. The sky was much bluer than it has been in some time, and the little bit of white was high enough to make it all the more vast. And all day I fought that nagging desire I have had of late to sleep. In fact I didn't sleep today, but every little while it was there, urging me to escape. Actually, I've been napping less than usual(I've always loved napping), but the escape-nap has been more of a temptation during leisure hours. What it is I am escaping, I hardly know. Certain ideas having been churning in my strange bit of brain, about life and death, though not as morbidly as the words themselves may lead one to believe. Actually, the passage in the Old Testament about God setting life and death before Israel , and urging them to choose life, that seems more the sense of what I mean. Only in the Old Testament it seemed obvious that life was GOOD and death was BAD, and that disobeying God would get Israel into trouble. My musings on life and death aren't nearly so pristine and, well, divinely appointed. At this point, more than ever before in my admittedlty short life, I feel so detached from the events and people in it. Worse, there are few moments when a niggling self-awareness and self-appraisal doesn't crowd in on more productive activities and thoughts. I see other people, and how their occupations(whatever they may be, whether exalted or humble, professional or domestic), well, OCCUPY them to a healthy degree, and I wonder why I haven't taken to it. I'm not sure how, but I feel as if I am not quite alive. Is it possible, I've wondered, for grown-ups to be chagelings? It's preposterous for a Christian to talk this way, or at least it seems so to me at the moment. Somewhere in this there must be a great deal of fear, my fear that is. If it could be this simple, I'd call it a fear of making mistakes. Actually, it is rather a relief to think of it that way, because that simply makes me proud. Pride is the thing which separates the devil from God. Love is what unites me to God, His not mine. Perhaps it is this same love that insists on ripping the decaying filth from my hands, lest it begin to eat at me as well. So be it. Perhaps I can't choose life after all, but I am content if He has chosen me."

"event","Today, as I sat listening to a little girl tell me about the ""baby alive"" doll she is getting for Christmas, I felt how privileged I am to be the one hearing so much of these little ones' random thoughts and wishes. Here was this child, 8 or 9 years old, spending her recess with me, chatting with me as if we were sipping lattes at some frou frou coffee shop! What confidence, what freedom! Oh, how special it all made me feel, as if God were showing me the strange treasures He inbeds in all the ""mundane"" living. I am a fool to be bogged down with the weight of living. I am meant to hold it all lightly, and be thankful for each track left behind, each note coaxed from this crude little instrument. Hasn't Christ already borne the weight of my existence that I might be with Him where He is? And yet, here I am. I read 1Corinthians 8 this morning, and was a bit baffled at the thought of all of creation being subjected to vanity. If this is so, thought I, how can I take any pleasure in this life I must live in the flesh? Only now does it occur to me that every experience, like the one I mention here, has a vein of gold that I can either redeem or overlook. How rich He has meant me to become! And all this time I have been mucking around, trying to keep my hands out of the very dirt where that gold, that pearl of great price, has resided from the start. 
""As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.""

"event","S,o I've picked up the guitar again these past couple of days. As it happens, learning guitar is much more productive when there is an actual piece I want to get through, rather than a few scraps of familiar music that I just dabble in now and again. I actually have a nice time of it, picking away for a good chunk of time. My fingers are rather sore, since I've finally begun using the lower three strings, which aren't nylon.  I'm rather glad, and don't feel quite so much like a dabbler when my fingers actually hurt long after I've stopped playing. I'm not a dabbler anymore! Ugh! So much of my life is spent in fear of being a mere dabbler in everything: playing guitar, teaching, writing, LIVING! Perhaps I should just admit that I am inherently a dweller in the shallows. There's that line from a Caedman's Call song: ""The Truth is a river where the strong can swim in deep, and the weak and the broken can walk across so easily...""  Perhaps I am weak after all, and should just get over it and scoot across to safety, instead of gazing, Ophelia-like, into the depths that I don't really want and can't really understand. It is rather a humiliating prospect, but then,  after all, when has humility ever done me harm?"

"event","I had intended to spend last week writing, seeing as how I had half days at work. Instead, I picked up the 600+ pages of SHIRLEY ,and consequently, wrote next to nothing. Well, Shirley's vast bulk was got through yesterday, and this morning I found myself puttering around aimlessly, feeling somewhat desolate without the pleasant company I had been enjoying so recently. Oh, the treachery of books! They entice you, promising to give you good things, if you will only give them your undivided attention. At first you conscilliate only half-heartedly, dropping them with every pleasant sight or smell that might draw you away. Later, they have worked their spell on you, and you think only of rushing back to them as you go about your daily tasks, relishing the moment when you can again surrender to their ministrations. And for a time you are happy with them, content with what they have to give. Finally, with the onset of the closing sentence, a panic grips you, and the sigh of satisfaction dies on your lips as you blink and look about you amidst a wave of disorientation. New distractions seek to dash the now empty cup away from your lips, and in vain you try to cling to it for only a moment longer. There, it has been swept away, and you are left only a vague, sweet memory of the taste... 
Is it right that I should desire to play the same trick on my fellow man, to mix similar concoctions that will end by leaving him with the same hollowness, the vague longing? Is the apparent betrayal truly a ministration after all, as it seemed when I drank so deeply ? Perhaps. Yes, perhaps some are meant to minister that hunger, so that Another can then minister the real substance that will ultimately fill it. I give thanks and sallute all the ones who have poked about in the tender places of my consciousness, and made me feel the very soreness of my soul. Infinitely preferable is that ache than the numbness that it has replaced. The ache makes me long for sweeter sensations in the end, that will neither fade nor be replaced with the hollowness that now threatens to overwhelm this faint existence."

"event","The latest item on my literary menu is Charlotte Bronte's hefty novel, Shirley, which tackles weighty labor issues amidst the more familiar domestic ones. I have barely made a dent, but I've read enough to be reminded of what a WONDERFUL writer Charlotte is. I love how I can start reading about the randomest thing, like an Irishman cooking a mutton chop inside a mill on a rainy day, and find it utterly engrossing. She makes me feel like a child receiving something delicious and hearty, something I needn't fear ingesting, yet something I can bear to savor as well without finding it overpowering, or excessively heavy. This particular book reminds me of Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton. As a matter of fact, I'm not surprised that the two ladies were such good friends. Well, I have many wise and articulate friends. Unfortunately, I still find myself straining to write something worthwhile, only to throw up my hands and sit perusing the words of my betters. Perhaps I am too young; my soul is not weighty enough, hasn't borne with much joy or sorrow to speak of. There is a girl, Caroline, in this story, a sweet young thing, full of hope and possibilities. Sadly, the only thing I can claim to share with this charming woman-child is a vague sense of uneducatedness. Is something indeed missing, or will the refining fires of life put to right that which is lacking in this old lady's character? One thing that I am pleased to note, when I see a child goofing off, there is a bit of me that hums in sympathy, that longs to howl mischievously and partake in the fun. If that is a token of my inexperience, then I don't mind wading in the shallows a bit longer."

This particular 6th grade boy was the bane of my existence last year. He was sullen and completely uncooperative. Well, he's still no angel, but is so much more pleasant that I find it easier to forgive him his many foibles. Today the kids were supposed to be writing narrative paragraphs. I gave student X a thesaurus when he asked me for a symonym for ""pleased."" He flipped through it, looking at various words, then moved on to the dictionary and did the same. Finally, he said he wanted to look up ""love."" There's this 4th grade girl in this group that he jokes around with and talks to a great deal, so I suspect I know why he wanted to look up ""love."" He didn't seem to like the definition, and expressed his boyish disgust quite fluently(perhaps too fluently!)saying it was weak, etc. I shoved my spanish New Testament turned to 1Corinthians 13 under his nose, thinking that he might get a kick out of reading in Spanish, along with gleaning a different take on ""love"". He read ""El amor es sufrido"" and then thrust it back at me in embarrassment, saying that reading it made him sound like a girl. His embarrassment was quite amusing to behold. I explained to him that it meant that love is patient. I made him look up patient, and it mentioned being able to bear pain or discomfort with calm. Then I likened it to a soldier's ability to withstand torture. He liked that, since he wants to be a soldier, and liked it even more when I said that there isn't anything weak about that kind of love. He asked where he could get some of this, and I tried not to let my excitement show. I told him he could only get it from God. How? By asking? How? By asking Him for it.That's it? And He'll just give it to me? Yes. Wow, I gotta get me some of that....After a while his self-consciousness seemed to return, and he started acting the tough guy again, but by then, I was thinking about his question, and about how many of these kids wouldn't recognize real, God-given strength or love because they have little experience with such things. It was really humbling. Do I love them that way? No, at least not enough. Do I ask for such love? Not enough, for if I did, I wouldn't lack love as I do now. God bless that boy, with his rude manners and hungry soul. Would that we were all as famished for ""some of that.""

Really, its quite foolish to think such thoughts, since I clearly do not KNOW what I want. Better yet, I wish I knew how I could be of service. I'm no slouch now, but clearly there is some fuzziness in light of occupation. Perhaps I have bought into that ""be all that you can be"" bologna(baloney?).

On the other hand, today I was talking with a student of mine(they certainly can't be called the cream of the crop, but they are sometimes very sweet) who had opted to stay in at recess. He is a very cheerful boy with eyes always in smiling slits. He came back to school from break with a hideous looking burn on the inside of his elbow. Apparently his elder brother managed to burn him with an iron(ugh!). We were discussing this elder brother, and how he accuses him of being gay and what-not. I told him he was no such thing, and then proceeded to share my own particularly uneventful romantic history, thinking to ease his mind. Can you believe it, the boy laughed at me! Not in a mean way, but he was just tickled at the absurdity of it all! I begin to think that is the tenor of my existence: a study in absurdity, but not a grotesque absurdity: more of a simplicity that borders on insanity.

"event","I found a beginning of a story in a notebook of mine, and I figured if I post it, it'll give me an insentive to finish the thing:
In these latter days the record of the first days of men on earth are summed up in a few short pages. Creation, corruption, destruction, then this present world. But echoes of what occured before this present time still sound dimly in our minds. These are necessarily romantic tales, for the sphere of these happenings has all but vanished, as this present sphere threatens to do as that day approaches. 
One such echo is an anecdote centered around what would now be called fallen angels. Lilith and the like. Whether or not Lilith existed, certainly among those who sought to consort with humanity there were many who were enough like Lilith to warrant the tales surrounding that controversial personage. One such figure was the one known as Astera. Some say she was made an angel. Others claim that angels only took on male forms among us, and say that she was the spawn of an angel and a daughter men. Whatever her origins, Astera appeared as a woman, uncannily beautiful and tall. There was no acknowledged loyalty on her part to the Rebel at that time, though allegiences could be discerned by observant men and angels alike.  
It was rumored that Astera lured men, mostly young, for love of her to practice strange acts in worship to angelic hosts, some say to the very one who fathered her, but this is not certain. Strange and vile whisperings of self-mutilation and slaughtered infants reached some, while other signs were visible in the strange and tragic perversions that dogged any man who ever associated with Astera. In time, Astera herself was reverenced by a strange breed of women who sought to gain her hold over their own men at whatever cost. 
One such woman was Vana. Much like Astera herself, Vana possessed a fine tall figure and beautiful face, but Vana's face held also a deep sorrow of its own. She had been a friendless child, for her mother had been a widow in her brother's house. It is said that this brother was vile, and did not keep his sons from meddling with Vana as she grew. Nevertheless, a rich farmer took Vana to wife soon after she reached womanhood. He died before the year was out in a strange fit of convulsions, and Vana was sent again to her uncle. All too glad to recover her bride-price, the uncle established Vana, as well as his aged sister, in a small hut away from his own buildings, and left them to themselves.

Right now I feel like I am so taken up with trifles that I could implode, or just fold into myself like the little man in ""The Great Divorce.""

He was lovely, splashing quickly beside us and then disappearing. I couldn't help squealing like a child. It made my day, perhaps my whole summer. There are times when the mundane weighs heavily upon me. It is true, I am cowardly, and certainly don't seek adventure of the wilder sort. But a moment like this, when I feel as though real life opens up in spite of me, makes me understand why heaven can exist. Real joy is unexpected, unimaginable, unknowable until you are in the midst of it. After he had gone, I looked for him, but couldn't spot him again.

I visited the place I used to live briefly yesterday. It was strange. A few things were different, but nothing to send one reeling. Anyhow, for some reason I felt quite bewildered. I felt like I was behaving strangely, like on my first day of kindergarten. I still remember bits of that day, sniffling a bit over my modeling clay as my mother left...I mention it because it all illustrates the broader sense of disortientation that characterizes my common experience these days. Anyhow, I think I need to learn how to behave myself. Start afresh, and all that. It isn't seemly for someone my age to go about like a warthog, plowing people under. If a bit of sifting is what it takes to make me courteous, so be it.

"event","I have a confession to make! I never read Crime and Punishment. That staple of American high school literature. I don't know how I slipped through the cracks! Well, actually, I do know how. My English teacher at the time had an unhealthy fixation on Hamlet, and made us pour over it for AT LEAST two semesters. What's worse, he made me hate it! In all fairness to Shakespeare, I recently reread Hamlet and liked it a great deal. So it was the teacher and his taudry take on the play. No Dostoevsky AND a bad interpretation of William S. to boot! Shame, shame! Badly done, Mr. ________! Anyhow, I began reading C&P a few days ago. I am enjoying it, as much as anyone can claim to ""enjoy"" Russian literature. It's rather like Listerine. You know its good to use it, but it hurts, it hurts, it hurts! Still, I envy the Russians their genuine bleekness. As that drunken man of Dostoevsky's says, people who suffer thus MUST be the more ready for the Kingdom of Heaven. I recently found out that my great, great grandmother was Ukrainian. It figures! That branch of ancestry has yielded no end of suffering (theirs, not mine)to harvest in my literary endeavors. I apologize if I sound prosaic and unfeeling about it all. I admit that I don't understand the first thing about suffering. All I know is that it is a thing to be respected, and for one who claims to desire an acquaintance with Christ, it is something to be anticipated, if not welcomed. Well, for the sake of Dostoevsky and those tragic ancestors of mine, I will herein quote Ecclesiastes 12:1,6 and Luke 6:22 and endeavor to take it to heart. It's hard, though. These things are so heavy, and everything in my experience has been so light and fluffy!

"event","Today was a continuation of my surreal, homebound weekend. Actually, it was a very nice Monday! This morning for my convalescence I was compelled to sit outdoors in the shade for quite some time. It was lovely! Thanks to an awsome irrigation system out back, there are flowers abloom, shady fruit trees, white and gold butterflies and bees(nice, non-africanized ones) frolicking about, perhaps a frog or two... I had a ball, and ate the biggest, most scrumptious nectarine from the tree that has also been feeding a small army of ravenous june bugs(is there another name for these?). Why, I even had fun cleaning the bathroom! I had the radio blasting and felt like the karate kid. A nice ending to a LOOOONG weekend. Lord willing, I'll have a respite from contagious diseases from the elementary kids for a while. What with the two rashes and now this phlem-fest, I feel like swallowing a bleach tablet before going to work!"

"event","Well, here I am at home under a self-imposed quarantine. The up-side to this harmless, yet persistent cough is that it gave me time to finish reading The Silmarillion. It was quite good. So sad, in just the right sort of way. The best authors make me so sad, but the sort of sadness that is better than cheeriness, I suppose its the sort of sadness that awakens a desire for a deeper, abiding consolation than this world cannot offer. Yes, thats it. A sadness that awakens a desire for the eternal.
Speaking of which, I felt like I was playing hookey staying home on a Sunday, heehee. Its quite childish, but I enjoyed myself nonetheless. I wonder if anyone else likes missing things just for its own sake? I think it delightful when someone says to me, ""Oh, you weren't there that time. Where were you?"" ""Oh, I was sick that day."" It's very lame. Probably, they were having oodles of fun, and I was in misery, but I still get a weird kick out of it all. I'll blame my big sis'(my most convenient cop-out) for ditching me as a child and giving me a sour-grapes complex.
But back to the Silmarillion, it was primarily about elves, yes? And they are always painted as wise and serene and somewhat impassive, at least for the most part. But all they do is fly into rages and kill people they shouldn't kill. When they aren't in blind rages, they have fallen in love with their jewels(holler, George MacDonald!Elect lady!) or their relatives, or their swords or whatever. And if that should fail, they are tricked into inviting Morgoth or Sauron to spend Christmas break at their house. What is up with these elves? Perhaps I am a suspicious, cynical little beast, and cannot fathom the tragic wheels that inevitably turn in the lives of the wise and great. Besides, its not that I didn't find it all tragic and beautiful. It was too tragic and beautiful, you know? When one is small and swarthy and has phlem caking the lungs, one grows weary of hearing about tall, pale people of undying beauty one after the other. I guess its the whole sour-grapes complex rearing its ugly head again. Boo!"

"event","I love days off. Lalalalala. Ahem. Days off are the opiate of this paticular individual. Or are they? Since they are still rather common to my experience as a worker bee, I tend to take them for granted and do nothing in particular. What should a day off consist of? I am still too young to show signs of wear and tear from my work week, so claims of having to recuperate would be dramatic at best, and downright dishonest at worst. Now-a-days, during summer especially, every moment of leisure awakens a latent guilt in me that I am frittering my life away. Oh well, the bothersome feeling isn't overpowering, so mostly I ignore it. Still, I am sadly self-conscious at this point, when my peers are all marching off to establish themselves in respectable careers, marriages, or both, while I am still as free and shiftless as the day I graduated college. Is it wrong to deny the claims of love and money, and actually take a breath and ponder where I belong? Most generous folks would pat me on the back and urge me to carry on. On the other hand, I am no hippy, and never was, and the thought that I am being unproductive urks me to no end. Ringing in my ear are the voices of countless educators and employers down the line, telling me that I have so much potential! But just as relentlessly there are a handful of female relatives informing me that my best eggs(blah!) will be lost during my twenties! They are both very good to bring such crucial matters to my attention, I say. It is I who am wicked for wishing that someone would just FORCE me to do the right thing, whatever that may be. Which brings me to the Theo-philosophical portion of my commentary. I often wondered with bemusement what my betters meant when they referred to ""waiting on God"" for their life decisions. Now I think my smug smile has changed to a pitious, teary-eyed smirk of commiseration. Waiting is not particularly arduous as missions go, but it makes one feel very small, until identity starts to seem the most important thing in the world, and the questions one dreads are the ones that used to role off the tongue! So I suppose I needn't feel guilty about these lazy days I sometimes ""enjoy."" I need not even dread the inevitable questions that begin to rise to the surface of my consciousness, as I sit petting the shamefully unkempt William Adolfus behind the ears. My Lord meant me to feel small, in the face of His largeness and unfathomableness, and the many answers He has waiting, while I slowly formulate my little questions. I must acknowledge my littleness, if I am ever to grow into anything of His making. How else would I escape the sad fate of gaining an identity apart from His own?"

"event","Alright. Perhaps I ought not write my first entry late at night, afflicted as I am with a cold. On the other hand, if I make excuses now, I'll never get started...So then, this will be my livejournal manifesto, to spur me on to be productive as a writer in any sense of the word. I decided to overcome my online-egotistical-look-at-me-look-at-me phobia for a handful of reasons. 
1.The first is that I am supposed to be a writer, as my favorite writing mentor Susan Straight once told me, and so I must WRITE or own myself a wretched, slothful ingrate. Which brings me to my second reason: 
2.I have recently moved back home, and in sorting mounds of junk, I fell to perusing several old notebooks filled with random jottings. Some, like the infamous ""high school notebooks"" I shared with a handful of friends, were quite witty and amusing and valuable for history's sake. Other writings were valuable for their introspective value, and actually recorded deep and thoughtful musings worth remembering and hashing out. Sadly, these were in the minority. Most of the stuff in the notebooks was fluff, at best the more flibberty-jibbit-y of my random thoughts, things that I would blush to have anyone else read for the sheer shallowness of both the subject-matter and the sentiments there recorded. I'm glad I've kept them, assuming they really do reflect the tenor of most of my thoughts in those days, if only because they inspire me to repent and be more honest and responsible when I take the trouble to put words down anywhere. From now on I hope to never be ashamed of what I write. Certainly, I reserve the right to be boring,mildly naughty, perhaps ignorant or naive, and to digress incessantly. But God forbid that I be purposely hurtful, insipid, thoughtless, irreverent, or (horror of horrors) ambiguous in my chronicling. Good to the use of edifying, as Ephesians 4:29 puts it, that will ever be my aim.  
3.And for my final reason: I am a big liar, since I am egotistical and fond of attention, and crave feedback even when I seem to avoid or shun it. So this will be an exercise in a healthy amount of ummm, sharing, if that's the right description. 
Sooo, I guess I'm off, as the horse racers would say! More Later....

""Let no corrupt communication proceed from your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers"" - (Ephesians 4:29, King James Version)"

"event","HEY YALL,

wow it feels good to be back, and yet it doesnt seem quite right...
well to start it all off i had the greatest time at myrtle beach with my best friend jenifer marie-we made tons of friends-luke,andrew,dalton waz our closest friends, we made others but those were the ones we hung out with most. we met this guy named arron and he waz realli cool every night him his brother his mom and friends would get drunk it waz pretty funny, he waz really cool.. after hanging out on the beach and concering mi fear of NIGHT TIME SHARKS WOW!! luke andrew and jenn made me go on the ocean around 11 at night i mean...i never did that before and mi mother warned me bout rapist and how i shouldnt be on the beach at night but hey..we can sumtimes try to be a dare devel..at least thats what i thought i was because sharks and rapists wow..scary!!! but i concered it with mi pals and with the help of lukeee-jenn and i also got our wonderful vera bradley purses which i must say is pretty hott!we also wanted a JOHN DEER SHIRT- and hell yeah...WE GOT IT-its hotter then..a goat- 
the funnest part on the vacation would have to be playing football in the lazy river with luke andrew and jenn...it waz surely hott-after jenn and andrew ripped the ball we had no other choice but PLAY MORE-...we played chicken alot and jenn and i went skinny dipping in the ocean...damn..it felt weeeeeirrd!-we made a new hand shake too that we found from one of the people we met in the -jacuzzzzzzi- its pretty cool, also from luke and dalton we learned sum new words..lyk..""HEY YALL"" lmao oh such good times..too many to remember..but wow the booty call waz crazzi AND i loved it..i couldnt ask for a better time..
i still think that we will meet up on a road trip with luke and andrew..it shall happen.. 

i really hope that we can meet up with luke and andrew they are truly one of the most amazing people in the world..i feel that i learned something from them..and i grew onto them..to the point where im confused..lyk i shouldnt be here that jenn and i belong with them..they are such wonderful friends, i feel lyk boardman is not for us, but we made a pack and we will stick together i kno it..


jenn.. i dont know wat i would ever do without you between getting those gorgouss purses-our new hott john dear shirts-skinny dipping in the ocean-concering my fear of being at the beach at night- eating all that flipping candy from that expensive candy place-and meeting the best friends you could ever meet..its priceless..i wanna be back..in fairy tale land where the drama is no where to be found



uhh im tirrreedddd night night


""uh bye"" -luke

"event","So, I went to a movie for the first time the other day, at an Odeon. It was the first time in two months that I've actually shook my head with culture shock.

You are assigned a seat. Yes, you can look at a chart and pick them, but said chart doesn't take into account important things like how much legroom there is. My friend and I average about 6 ft. in height and we accidentally picked a row that had less space than an airplane seat for our longer than average limbs. So, since the theatre was empty, we moved somewhere better. 

There was a half hour of commercials and previews! A half hour! I'm used to 15-20 on the rare occasion that I go to an AMC or a Lowes in the States, and even less when it's an independent theatre. When the commercials/previews were over, half an hour after the film was billed to start, they brought the house lights up for five minutes before actually starting the movie. That was when smart people, who clearly knew the deal, showed up, which meant we had to change seats for a second time. In retrospect, we should have gone down to ask for a switch but...but...shouldn't you just be able to sit where you want?

The movie itself was fun. We saw The Bank Job for the Statham, really.

One perk: Doctor Who Season 4 preview on a big screen! Giant silver-screen Doctor was yummy and the apparent booting of Freema and the BP return (if only for a small arc) was excellent! Maybe when that show fades to cult status (yes, moreso than now), indie theatres will run Doctor Who marathons like they do with Firefly. It's so fun. The last one I went to had a delish Chinese buffet for 5 dollars + admission. Wonderbar!"

Going to Portugal for my break, both Porto and Lisbon. I'm really looking forward to it, since I've never been to that area. I've seen a bit of continental Europe, so that will be awesome. I'm going with people I met in the program; lots of fun. 

A friend of mine took a polaroid of our awesome Scottish professor. He has this 80s-tastic briefcase and she got him staring up from out of it. It's absolutely perfect. 

Speaking of Polaroids, wtf? Why stop making the film? I have my Dad's camera from when he was in college, over 30 years ago. I cough up for the film, which is waaaay overpriced, because nothing truly captures the moment like a polaroid. In this digital age, sometimes it's a good thing not to be able to delete a picture. Though some of my friends would disagree. 

On my own this weekend, as flat mates are off traveling abroad. I went to the National Portrait Gallery on Thursday with a class. I've seen it a couple times, but their collection really can't be beat. A few times we stopped to listen to the lectures being given to young school kids, and they were pretty informative. Plus, the kids were really engaged. I can't imagine a group of ADD-crazy American kids being led around the Met (we don't really have an equivalent to the NPG) and not fading off after a while.

Boyfriend sent me roses from the states, but they came without a vase, so finding one is #1 on today's to-do list. Went out dancing last night until 4 and woke up about an hour ago. Going out again tonight....eep! Our program has connections to an area College, so we're doing a weird sort of social mix at a club's student night. I'm just going for dancing dancing dancing, if my feet heal in the next six hours.

"event","It's weird, right after I got into top chef and marathoned the second and third seasons (what I've missed thus far), I saw two bits of Top Chef season 2 news, neither of which was particularly pleasing.

Marcel, resident douche of S2, was <a href=""http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/top_chef_2/2007_Jan_22_marcel_hit_ilan_friends"">hit by a beer bottle</a href> in Vegas; the gash required 30 stitches to sew up. I secretly liked Marcel and his foams and say what you want about his behavior in the kitchen, the other chefs used him as an excuse to get really nasty. I always thought it spoke more to their characters than his, but whatevs.

Then I read that Josie, who was voted out around mid-season, and friends were <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/seven/09132007/news/regionalnews/chef__my_gay_bash_nightmare.htm"">harassed and abused</a href>, with the attackers making clear their homophobic motives. 

While these are two wildly separate incidents with wildly separate motives, both incidents really pissed me off. In Marcel's case, he may have played up the douchy behavior for show, but some (I'm assuming) drunk malcontent thought to be the bringer of karmic justice for what reason? We all know someone like Marcel. He deserves some good, friendly verbal abuse from time to time (especially when he's wildly off base), but not a beer bottle. 

It's harder to tell in Josie's case whether her attackers were just homophobic s#*ts or recognized her from tv, but either way, what they did was totally sick. 

I admit, I don't think too highly of people who want to eat bugs and bare their souls to housemates and jump into pits of snakes and nails for a bit of reality screen time (and moolah), but these Top Chef contestants are seriously talented. They're trying to make a living and they've worked really hard and totally don't deserve physical abuse for putting themselves on tv (nor, I must add, do any reality contestants. I don't like violence on general principle).

"event","Ok, here it goes. I am going to try to recount to the best of my ability the hazy craziness that was the Witching Hour. This is going to be a looong post, so I get to use.... LJ CUTS!

<lj-cut text=""Thursday: On which everything hinged"">So, Thursday had sort of a mission:impossible theme. I only found out about the Witching Hour a few weeks before and thus learned that tickets could no longer be purchased on the website, only at the door. It is a good thing I'm currently in Boston, which is thirty minutes from Salem, the host village, by commuter train, plus 15-20 minutes on the T. So, tickets at the door went on sale at noon Thursday and I had an Astronomy lecture at 2, so you can deduce that my window to make everything happen was fairly small.  At least I was only going to purchase a student ticket so it was 50% off. Anyway, BU is on the green line, and the three outbound green lines converge at Kenmore station so I walked there to catch a train to North Station. From there I caught an 11:15 train that got me to Salem at 11:45. I walked to the Hawthorne Hotel where registration was open, and after standing in line for about five minutes, I was informed that because I hadn't registered yet, I had to go to the Salem Waterfront Hotel. This wouldn't have been so bad, except for the fact that I had to catch a 12:38 train back to Boston to make my 2:00 lecture. eeeep! So the Waterfront was completely crazy, clearly the headquarters of the operation. After waiting ten more minutes (clock ticking, I know I looked visibly impatient and felt bad about it because it's another source of stress for anyone who has to deal with me) I got registered.

It was after this that I became the crazy girl running through Salem. Some guy even did one of those sweeping shots with his video camera, perhaps thinking I was some petty thief running from the scene of the crime? who knows? who videotapes random people for no reason? anyway, I made my train, made my lecture, and was all around hysterically giddy for the remainder of the evening. 

note: friendboy also asked me out after my last class to add to the explosions of happiness! what a day!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Friday: In which I enter the fairy hill"">After my French class ended at 5, I raced back to the dorm and raced back over to Kenmore and North Station. I got into Salem at 6:30 and made another trek to the Waterfront to finish my registration and somehow did it in time to make the Friday Keynote dinner with Holly Black (squee!), Charles de Lint, Nancy Farmer, and some other wonderful person whose name escapes me right now. The food was good, and I also got to meet Sarari and gatewaygirl and Maiga who I ended up spending a lot of time with for the remainder of the weekend.  After the dinner and panel, gatewaygirl drove us over the Sheraton to see Harry and the Potters which was a freaking awesome show. Even they seemed really happy because there was this huge room filled with people who knew the lyrics. They rocked out. We rocked out. Later, Rachel Robichaud played some acoustic songs she'd written which were fucking hilarious. Except she was very anti H/Hr and so was the crowd EXCEPT FOR ME! whee, and then I won one of her cds for free because I created the best Mary Sue. OOOO, I forgot, while Harry and the Potters were playing, Chris Rankin (Percy Weasley) was there signing and I took a picture with it. As soon as I find a host, I'll post it, plus other craziness. A group of Death Eaters stormed into the ballroom and kidnapped Chris, then performed the graveyard scene from GoF holding him hostage. I bought some merch for Audy and myself, and am listening to it now. 

So anyway, after Rachel had played for a while, we got kicked out around midnight. Most people went to hang out in the lounge and ordered pizza, but I took some time to call Kate and get my bearings. Maiga was commuting and I didn't really know my roommates, so I just hung out for a while. Someone wrote me a Mary Sue'd Hogwarts letter which is thoroughly hilarious.  At 1, they screened SS and Percy was there along with several inebriated women. Again, hilarity ensued, not just because everyone knew the dialogue, but the crowd went wild whenever Percy came on screen. I ended up going to bed around 2:30.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Saturday: It rained a lot, aka omg you did what?"">So I woke up at 7:30 (do the math, NO SLEEP!) I would like to take a moment to rant about the shuttle system. I get that there wasn't a really convenient place to put a lot of people in the area, but the Sheraton in Danvers was thirty minutes away from Salem and the shuttle system wasn't the greatest transport. I don't fault the coordinators for trying, but someone must have said at some point that people would spend a great deal more time than necessary (read, at all) pissing about a freaking school bus. But I digress.

Bussed over, needed serious coffee fix, got it, plus a wretched blueberry muffin. Went to a panel which featured Heidi Tandy, a name the fandom knows and loves (I think at one point she gave me writing tips. Maybe not), plus several other interesting writers and professors. They talked about ethics and law in fandom, and Heidi brought up the time Snitch! appeared on the front page of the Sunday NY Times with a blip about the secret world of HP fanfic, which was very awkward for all involved. This story also resurrected an awkward memory for me because my mom read that article and was like, ""Is this what you're doing at two in the morning?"" 

A presentation by Tamora Pierce followed, and I'd been squeeing about seeing her for weeks. Zoe, it was fantastic to see her, though she mostly talked about various women in ya fantasy lit as opposed to her own characters. Nothing about Dane/Numair, my favorite Immortals ship!  I was sort of disappointed that she didn't mention Sherwood Smith's Crown/Court Duel which I love, but she did talk about Cimorene in the Dragon series by Patricia Wrede, one of my favorite heroines. This was followed by cheap and cheerful diner fare with Maiga, and as we were sitting, Tony Toledo came over and sat with us. He hadn't any clue about hp fanfiction/the intensity of the fandom until he came here. We steered him toward some stories we liked and just talked about writing in general. He's a story teller, and thus had some really interesting input about development of characters, especially when we talked about development in fanfic, taking characters that have been created and manipulating them in our own directions in a believable way.  

After lunch was an editing panel with Tamora Pierce, Sharyn November, and two others, also lovely, names escape me. It just occurred to me that I could look these people up, but it's after midnight here and I'm exhausted, so just take my word. This previous fact also explains my shitty grammar and lack of correct capitalization. Forgive. (Fuck it, Ellen Datlow and Charles N. Brown were the other two panelists. Forgive the explicative.) This was followed by a H/D OTP roundtable led by Emma Grant, whose fic I am told I must read, stat. Here I also met akahannah who steered me toward some decent H/D fic. We listened to Nancy Farmer read for a bit, and then I went back to the hotel to grab my copy of <i>Tithe</i> for Holly Black to sign. Came back, met Maiga to hear Barb read from her fic (one of the few H/G I can stand). It was pouring like crazy when we left so instead of seeking the Witches Brew Cafe we went back to the diner. They had great fries and they were warm, so no complaints here. We trekked back to the Waterfront and caught the last of the auction. Lauren of atypically.net had made some hats, one that sold for $200. Anyone remember when that website was first up and we were all taking her quizzes? 

Holly Black read from Valiant and then a chapter from Ironside, which completely made my day. Had she not, I would have asked what was going to happen to Kaye and Roiben because I loved their first story. They she signed my book and I tried not to go bat-shit crazy fangirl on her. I think I succeeded. Maiga and I had nothing better to do, and going outside meant rain and more cold (to update, it has morphed into a full blown head/chest cold thing that bites) so we stayed indoors. And guess who was there...Cassandra Claire. She was really nice as I blabbed about how much I love DV, how updates got me through high school and band camp, and just went on babbling in general. She shared my shuttle sentiments. I was all in favor of a Rufus!purple tour bus like the one he had at Summerfest in Milwaukee; she suggested one with two or three stories, very Knight Bus. 

We went back to the Sheraton and my phone was dead so I had to make an expensive long distance phone call to check in with mum and dad.  I told them about hearing Holly and talking to Cassandra and they were all ""omg you did what??"" Ok, minor fangirl tangent. Ok, no, there's no way to gush about DV without sounding too weird/stalkerish. I really like it. I will leave it at that. At the Sheraton we hung out with some actors who were performing scenes from the books and movies, with Shawn as Pansy. They invited me to join them Sunday night. This messed with my plans because I was going to go home to  study and sleep Sunday afternoon, but Maiga wanted me to go to the Ball/Panel Sunday night, so I changed my plans. Went to bed at 2:30 again. Do you see a pattern forming?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sunday: Hot girl on girl pretending to be boy on boy action"">Woke up at 7 to take the train into Boston for camera/phone charger/ball attire. Came back at noon for a Costuming workshop. Audy wanted me to take notes because she's going to be Hermione for Halloween and boy did I. People were really into it, especially the adults. They linked a bunch a websites similar to the ones I used to make my Arwen costume (back when I had long hair!) that show you how to modify patterns. After than was a HG/SS (squee) presentation, and I was miffed that I missed the previous presentation because it kept getting referenced. This was followed by a lecture and then some shopping. Then, slash panel! It was sitting at events like this that make me happy about being a part of the fandom. Honest discussion about a topic that would, at the least, annoy a lot of people. Varying levels of some people's seriousness aside, regions of the fandom are much more tolerant than society at large. I appreciate that. I don't think I've articulated this well, but the sentiment is there.

I went back agaaaaain to the Sheraton to shower/change for the Ball and went back to hear the Death/Afterlife panel at the Peabody Essex museum. The ball was sort of awkward. This whole event was about 90% female, which wasn't bad, but the room was huge and well lit. It's hard to describe, it just wasn't the greatest location for a bunch of people to drop it like it's hot (ok, you know that's one of those sentences I wish I'd never heard, but it fits. meep.) Maiga and I got them to play Franz Ferdinand and that got some people dancing, but the Hufflepuffs had some weird ritual and they abducted Snape so I have nothing to give. We left a bit later.

Acting out scenes from Harry Potter was one of those events that can only be fully explained to good friends. I was Sirius Black and had to die over and over again, falling behind a black veil. The actual performance went pretty well. Everyone took pictures, including me. I think Rachel knows someone who taped the whole thing, so if it gets posted, I'll link it. The actors were pretty serious, despite the fact that the rehearsed portion ended with Harry Potter and the Voldemort Dance Party. yeah. what I said before. friends, you all are. Once that was finished, we were free to delve into the realm of OTP. This portion of the evening was hazy, but I think we managed H/D, H/D/Snape, H/D/LM, G/everyone, and S/R. yes, I was Sirius. Yes, there was some girl on girl pretending to be boy on boy action, a tangent from the Shrieking shack scene in PoA. And I gave the ""this heart"" speech. I'm going off in my corner now. 

I managed to stay up until 3 watching PoA and everyone talked about meeting up again at Lumos 2006, so yes, I'm going to that. Watching HP movies with fans at all levels of healthy inebriation is a riot. I wrapped myself in my cape and screamed with everyone until I was too tired to stay longer. 

Monday was like waking up outside the fairy hill. I woke up and went straight for the train, so there was no formal goodbye. The entire weekend I got about 18 hours of sleep. not good. I fell asleep on the train and then for five hours at the dorm. And then, Hahira, Astronomy midterm today. 

So yes, that was my weekend under the fairy hill, completely surreal. I did a lot of amazing stuff, saw/heard some amazing people. Did some crazy things.

Also, I am insane. 

You've probably realized that by now.

Goodnight.</lj-cut>"

"event","These past few days have been quite hectic, but not in any way that was overly stressful. I made a list of movies I haven't seen and need to see. I managed to get the week's work done and walked through the entire Muger Library, something I'd always wanted to do. I'm working on my plans for the Salem trip next weekend. It'll be miraculous if I manage to get everything I want done, but if I do, it will be an amazing three days. It's weirdly only six here and the sun is almost gone, but I guess daylight savings time starts soon. 

I found out a girl who I went to school with for seven years was hit by a bus at UIllinois. I didn't know here that well, and I feel very conflicted because not only did I not know her well, she was also very bitchy to people not her friends. However, her life was taken away prematurely and I send heartfelt condolences to her parents. No parent should have to outlive their child. 

There's no good transition I'm capable of producing. Today I walked in a dream-state, never fully awake and always two seconds from falling asleep. I was up late chatting with Kate, Willie, Kristy, and Jamie, so I enjoyed all the catching up. I miss my friends, not that I haven't made really great ones here. I guess I'm just looking forward to reach the comfort zone I had with my home friends here. I always feel turned on here (not sexual, just like a light switch) and I'm a little scared of being bitchy and moody, two things that can be unintentional but cause some problems. 

My writing professor loved my Kafka imitation but then ripped into my Staw summary. Ick, I would have much preferred to take the beating and then the praise. Thus I left on a sour note, only to be remedied by a walk on Bay State. It was really cold this morning. I went out in a sweatshirt and the wind was biting. I'm really excited for tomorrow, shopping and MFA. There's a lot of astronomy notes and laundry and other like diversions between then and now, so therefore I take my leave."

"event","I really should be going to bed, but no. I went to the DFP writers workshop and actually got excited about writing for the paper. The film and music editors were both really cool, so I hope to take up an assignment soon. In fact, it was kind of funny, she said she's only reserving two advanced screenings for herself, the new Pride and Prejudice and Harry Potter. Waaaaaaa. That's cool. I hope to be in her position some day. 

I met Virginia today; she lives in west tower and I lent her the AIH cd. We ate dinner and I might go with her on Tuesday to see someone she knows dj at a local club. That should be pretty great. Finally someone in my building who likes the same music. She told me about the Ansel Adams exhibit at the MFA which is free for BU students and I think Yenting and I are going to go next weekend. Also, she hasn't been to the garment district yet, so we might go sometime soon. I'm terrifically pleased by this.

Also had a really nice chat with Molly. She's coming in October to check out the school and I'm going to walk her around, sort of like when Amanda walked me around Tufts and gave me really great, non university-sponsored information about the campus and people. I really appreciated that.

And so another week starts. I should really get to bed. Hopefully things will stay good. That's all I can ask for."

Somehow I managed to get everything I needed to do done, and despite a major lack of sleep, I'm feeling pretty good. I saw a movie with Yenting and we snuck in cookies my mom sent, so we had extra fun. After two random encounters on the street walking back, we are home safe and without anything to do for the next few hours until we crash. I'm probably going to buy an LCD soundsystem ticket because I thought the show was on the day I leave for home, but it's actually the sunday before. A good way to go out, dancing to good music. Tomorrow I'm going to inquire about my jobs and figure out where the good knitting store the knitting club recommended is. The time for scarves has come. 

On a more serious note, I'm still debating with my double major. I don't really have any solid interests besides English, so while Journalism or Biology would be wonderful to study, both are major investments that need to be figured out sooner that I'm comfortable with. I guess I'll just have to keep thinking about it, though something tells me I'll be working in a cubicle somewhere no matter what I do. But, it's too soon to tell. 

I'm actually kind of tired and feel a little pathetic because it's friday night. I really have no wish to seek out entertainment farther than my dorm at this hour, plus Joe and Stephanie are around so maybe we'll do something. Also, my camera batteries finished charging, so tomorrow I'll hopefully buy a cable to upload my photos of people/places and post them online. That would be fun. I'll just have to find a free host, but that shouldn't be a problem. Any suggestions?

What else? I never noticed the radio antenna on top of COM. If you gave it a four pronged base, we could have our own Eiffel Tower which would be great. Something to brag about. The leaves are just starting to turn, which means the so-called New England Autumn is soon to start. I hope. No more 83 degree days. I'm a big fan of colder weather. I can't remember a real autumn, just massive leaf collection and then frosts. Walking on Bay State to class will be gorgeous. 

I used a meal on an apple. Lame, but it they were serving burritos AGAIN. It's the fourth night in a row; I had one the first two. Towers dining sucks as far a selection, but I guess I have to stick it out. 

A part of me really wants to stay up and watch the sun rise, but I have work due tomorrow and really shouldn't stay up any later than I have to. I want to go for walks, but can't seem to get my lazy ass out of sloth or study mode. 

This feels so lethargic, and it's probably because my tea finally cooled to a drinkable temperature. Mad props to illegal hot pots. Apparently someone in Warren got busted with a fake id, which sucks seeing as it's the third week of school. Do they expel people for that? 

Yenting is actually going to bed before me, a major first. Normally I'm the one that's in bed because sleep is wonderful. Tomorrow is going to suck, at least until classes end and then I'm free to have a life, if only for a weekend. I should probably get back to work. I just thought I'd say hi. Hi."

<h1>LJ Interests meme results</h1>
<ol>
<li><b> bollywood</b>:<br>I love the colors and the dancing even though I have no idea what anyone is saying. I got introduced to this fabulous world through Ghost World the movie, that amazing opening scene, and yes I dry my nails like that. I love Mira Nair and anything on the IFC. Plus, it's a great way to waste time; most of the real bollywood films are between three and four hours. </li><li><b> drawing</b>:<br>I wish I were better at it. My need to draw comes and goes very strongly. Sometimes I produce crap and swear never to do it again. If I don't lose interest, I can be pretty good. I like drawing flowers and inanimate objects. Also, anything that shows movement (wind, etc.)</li><li><b> harry potter</b>:<br>Ah, this paragraph could go on for ages. I love Harry Potter without shame. I squeed, wibbled, t00bed, and worshiped Cassie Claire (and still do to a much lesser extent). The books are good. DV is better. I analyze the movies like Hitchcock or Fellini films (or any other film of Great Significance). The fourth one will come out and I will dress up (or at least wear a scarf).</li><li><b> indie rock</b>:<br>I asked Katie to be like Rob in High Fidelity and make me (Laura, ironically) a tape of songs she thought I'd like, and thus I was introduced to an amazing world that included Air, Jeff Buckley, The Flaming Lips, Beck, The Replacements, The Smashing Pumpkins, etc. The events that followed were my first forages into Indie Rock, and I haven't looked back since. </li><li><b> jazz</b>:<br>One of the few things I have in common with my Dad. There's a resource I haven't used. I've always wanted to find some non-smooth-sounds sax solos because they're great to read to. I remember sitting in a jazz club in Montreal with Mum drinking cafe au lait and listening to two sets, and then again with Dad at an Irish pub here in Boston. Both were smoky and perfect. I wish I was more well versed here, but I like jazz will have to suffice.</li><li><b> long way round</b>:<br>I hope I am like Hillary's mom when I'm her age. She has great tastes and introduced me to Long Way Round, a transition from our fan-girlish gushing about Velvet Goldmine. Naked men frolicking in Russian streams, Ewan getting gasoline in his eye TWICE! For relaxing times, this is wicked awesome. </li><li><b> pirates</b>:<br>Who doesn't love pirates? Really? Not rhetorical! Well, maybe a little bit.</li><li><b> sense and sensibility</b>:<br>My English major/kate winslet/emma thompson what have you inner geek loves this movie and this book. It's not only a great story/film, but it also captures perfectly the relationship between an elder and younger sister much like myself and Audy. I think I found solace in the fact that Elinor had a happy ending (we're very much alike).</li><li><b> the basic eight</b>:<br>THE HIGH SCHOOL MANIFESTO! I would not be who I am today without this book. Its offspring: our dinner parties, badgering Ms Glarner, the non-existent Grand Opera Breakfast Club (it exists in our hearts), Lemony Snicket love, Watch Your Mouth love, competitive croquet, our quest for absinthe that doesn't suck, developing panache on a daily basis. There is probably more. </li><li><b> tom stoppard</b>:<br>Arcadia and Rosencrantz and Gildenstern Are Dead are amazing plays. Arcadia on the stage is orgasmic. I wish I could have seen Rufus Sewell as Septimus Hodge, that character hot.</li>

I saw Elie Wiesel speak and felt awful because I could barely keep my eyes open. Then I auditioned for the Shakespeare society's production of Measure for Measure with two monologues, Katherine's last speech from <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> and a modern piece as told by a sex maniac. I tried to make it real! hehe, we'll see how it turns out.

Got put on the spot this morning in writing after having been awake for maybe ten minutes, and thus started the day in a bitchy mood. There's nothing like large quantities of late nite fried food to set things right. I just wish I could be this awake more often. My natural state seems to hang precariously near to a great big bucket of sloth. I finally got my bank crap in order and was able to order my Architecture in Helsinki ticket, so there's something to look forward to. 

I'm still looking for the Viva Vintage and Dr. Wax equivalents here in Boston, because I enjoyed going there even if the clothes rarely fit. It was always a fun way to clear my head, that and the walk from whatever lame Evanston parking space I could find. I walk a lot, but it's usually because I'm running behind as opposed to enjoying the weather or thinking about the great mysteries of the world. And that, as they say, is that."

So the frat party didn't work out last night because we got there too late and it was really crowded. However, we got a personal invite to one next week. This actually turned out for the best, because a group of us ended up sitting on the steps of CAS/Archeology and talking for an hour, then walking back to the dorm and watching Mean Girls till 3 in the morning. Sanae and I kept laughing stupidly because we're both from the North Shore and thought their Old Orchard was silly and lamented over the absence of a Walker Bros. Also, they filmed that final mathletes scene at U of Toronto, I recognized the major lecture hall, the largest in Canada.

I left my copy of <i>Dead Souls</i> in my astronomy lecture and am now hatching a cunning plan to get it back. Today is really overcast and windy which makes walking to classes fun, very much like home. 

I MADE THE ORCHESTRA! Which is wonderful. I was freaking out and the director was really nice and she liked my happy dance when she told me I made it. Also, the people I was waiting to audition with were all really nice and I hope to get to spend more time with them at rehearsals and such.  

Tonight is a floor activity, a double feature projected at the BU Beach, which is actually a patch of grass (major road Storrow Dr. is behind a hill, so the roar of cars going fast sound a bit like waves??? I don't know who made that up.) 

I also signed up for email updates about the Boston Film Festival, which would be a great chance to see movies BEFORE ANYONE ELSE!

I really need to buy a corkboard to keep track of all this stuff. I love the view out my window (which is why I picked this desk) and I would take a picture of it except I have no idea how to do something like that. Also, my camera batteries are dead. 

Some girls on my floor went to all the guys floors in our tower and knocked on all these doors. I tagged along because it was something to do, and I discovered that this guy I met at common ground is in my building, so that was cool. I also think I found some people to go to Of Montreal with. A girl (with my name!) who I met at orientation and some girls in her building are going, which is totally freaking awesome! 

Tonight we are playing poker on the ground floor and then classes start tomorrow. I admit the whole thing will be anticlimactic because I only have two classes at 2:00 and 3:30, but that gives me all morning to practice my violin for the Thursday audition and write my entrance piece for the paper.

I got this email from my astronomy professor who said something along the lines of, ""If you don't like math or physics, this is NOT the class for you."" Fuck!!! I like stars, and planets. Isn't that enough? NO.

I really am looking forward to the structure of an academic schedule. I've met some great people next door and down the hall, so my intense fears of being a total social reject have subsided somewhat. I still have to meet Yenting and start some clubs before the feeling completely goes away, but I'm working on it.

Also, I discovered, much to my chagrin, that my dorm is a block away from the MIT frat row which is known not for it's students' academic prowess but for the crazy parties they throw. And, they've been going at il all evening. Crazy!!! Also, there is no late food until tomorrow which means I will have to cross their lines if I want to go to the convenience store that's open until 2 in the morning. I'm kind of tired and we're going out to breakfast tomorrow, so I should probably sign off, but I feel like voicing my insecurities a little longer. I feel like this whole experience is tottering on a ledge and could fall off any day now. I know that this also will subside with time, but time...takes time. Cliche's all around.

Now there is a lingering question...where to store all of this? The dining room has become the unofficial dumping ground and even that's filling up quick. But, but, but, less than a week to go. 

Kate left me alone to deal with my sickly need for an 80s movie fix, so I think I'll purge that tonight with some pizza. I saw the Brothers Grimm with Zoe and Candace last night and it was quite entertaining. Mom and I have been discussing genre and audience expectation, so I went in anticipating something fun and fantastical. That is what I got and thus enjoyed myself. I suspect that Ebert went in wanting something more and was justly disappointed. He's a bit of a fair weather friend if I do say so myself.

Also hung out with the drunken drummer of Ben Lee's band pondering our ethical place in the universe (among other things.) Mad props to Kate for thinking that one up on the fly. 

Saw Broken Flowers and didn't like it as much as I thought I would. Bill Murray was excellent but the tone and the pacing were off. Also saw Skeleton Key which was kind of funny and weird. I still have yet to see Me, You, and Everyone we Know, which is now at Highland Park. I'll probably do that tomorrow along with buy tap shoes.

I was going to buy Beck tickets for Boston, but the show is on a Thursday night and that is orchestra rehearsal which you can only miss for serious illness or family death. However, this is made better by the fact that Of Montreal is playing a week after move-in. Mayyyyyyyyybe I'll go? Va savoir?"

Favorite acts included Broken Social Scene because, well, BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE. Also, A.C. Newman, Andrew Bird, the Wrens, the Decemberists, and Out Hud. I have to see them again; they were crazily rocking out and the whole crowd was dancing. In a smaller dark space, that has got to be one kick-ass show. I stood watched half of the Deerhoof set, but I liked them better when they opened for Wilco with much more enthusiasm. Also, while sitting to hold my spot for the Decemberists, I got a great view of the Les Savy Fav antics, and boy, am I glad I was not in that immediate vicinity. Lunacy took hold of that crowd. I hear the police were involved. Whatever.

I hate math, which my recent diagnostic exam proves. Fuck it, I place out with my ACT subscore. No more math for me, even if it means taking a lot of computer classes for that Divisional Studies department. I spent a lot of time on public transportation this weekend just thinking about things.

I took my french placement exam and did well, but the math looks prickly. I'll do it tomorrow.

I'm buying White Stripes tickets for Boston, though maybe I'll see them here, too.

I forgot how happy the B-52s are. Just happy dancy 80s joy. B-52 everyone!"

For now it's ok cause I'm sort of lazy unless I have a project, though I did get all the book lists I'd saved on my computer printed and I'll start reading some of them. My car is currently being serviced so I'm stuck at home. Not that bad since I've been staying out late and need sleep :-) ah sleep. It's nice.

For some strange reason, I see today as the beginning of an adventure. I'm filled with giddy excitement. 

Last night rocked. Cheesecake factory with Kate, Willie, and Becky without getting cheesecake! Then Velvet Goldmine! A lovely evening!

PS. that emoticon is really strange and does not capture my sentiment at all. It's more, like, committed."

"event","It's been booming all afternoon. Once upon a time he invited me over to try it, but has never re-extended the offer, so I have decided to loathe the wretched thing. This getting up at 11:00 thing was really great when I was staying up until 2 in the morning, but lately it feels a bit silly, like wasting good daylight. I should be doing things, not sleeping through them. (which is what my parents always said. shiest.)

I've been a busy little bumblebee and it promises to continue until I leave on Friday. I am so excited for this trip. I love new places and this promises to be a beautiful one. I will have to study those italian language tapes that were lent to us. I like knowing the home language, even if it's three sentences and I butcher them mercilessly."

"event","I graduated from High School yesterday. And then ate some really good pasta. This cold of mine has found it's way into my lungs which means it will NEVER, EVER, go away. I think the best way to describe the past few days is bizarre. I've been sleeping way too much so the days sort of melt together. I have this unfortunate habit of getting ready to go somewhere and do something and I have some time to spare so I pick up a book or a newspaper to glance at the headlines and the next thing I know, I'm five minutes late. How does this happen? Because I really want it to stop. 

Bitch bitch moan moan. I'm really tired and fed up and I'm not sure why. I got a gift from a family friend: A Boston College sweatshirt. I thought it was really funny cause you know, an easy mistake. And then it was like, nooooo. Weird."

"event","I have been staring at my seven page draft of the multi text for almost two hours now. I wrote out the works cited in an attempt to actually do something, and I edited the paper draft to death, now I just have to actually execute these changes. I've got to do them now so I won't have to do them later. Plus there's all this really nasty stuff in the windpipe which means I've gotten sick again. Bugger that. 

Today started out so nice, but being cooped up with things to do on a nice day is never fun. I'd go out and take a walk, but that would inevitably take me to the drive through starbucks where I'd sit with a book until dark and I reallllllllllly just want to finish this stupid essay so I can move on to all the other work I haven't been doing. Maybe I'll get something tonight. If anyone happens to read this before said evening and wouldn't mind going out, I'd love to hang out with someone. Yes, this is a pathetic plea, one made in excellent humor. 

I think I'm going to go out and find some chips."

"event","Well, it looks like I'm a-going to Boston University which is super super fantastic/excellent/woot! I now feel really relieved accompanied by a sense of blah. I don't want to do any of my homework which is baaaaaaaaaaad. Very baaaaaad, plus I'm stage managing the spring shows so that means not coming home until late. Stir in watching way too much tv and it looks like I've got to be on my best behavior until after AP exams, or I've got a one way ticket to the bad place. 

Today: best english class ever. BW spent the whole time playing great music and asking us to write about the distinct voices. It was so cool. I should probably tell him I'm going to BU since he went there. Maybe he could give me some professor's names to look up when I'm there. 

Speaking of which, I really am excited that school is almost over. I'm looking forward to the summer and spending time with people I'd don't get to see very often. I'll be 18 so curfew will no longer be an issue which is always excellent. I'll get to read my books that have been of late lying dormant on my floor or on my bookshelves. Poor souls with no one to love them. 

Well, must keep at it. Ta ta!"

Just kidding!

I watched another crap movie that made me feel really good about things. It's spring break which we all really needed, except there's nothing to do but sit on the couch or do homework, neither of which is very appealing. I thought I might get crafty and make something, but seeing how I'm broke and have nowhere to go, that puts a damper on that.

I saw Bride and Prejudice last night. I would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind A LOT of camp, lots of color, great dance numbers, and a very overworked plotline. I'm a sucker for Bollywood, so this was fun. I wish they would send us more."

"event","Ok, so I went downtown on St. Patrick's day with Molly and several strange and wonderful things happened. The only bad things were the urine soaked Howard L station and leaving a CTA card with about five bucks in the slot the machine. or maybe it's just in my coat. or maybe it fell out of my coat. a crazy night to say the least.

I hung out with Jamie and Robin for a very short time, but it was still nice to see people I haven't seen in a long time. I was also foiled once more in my search for a blazer that fits right, including a long slim torso and long sleeves (Which doesn't exist ANYWHERE!!!)

I got soooo much done today though I won't really realize it until tomorrow when I go to do more work and I don't have that much to do. 

I'm living in this constant state of fatigue punctuated by interesting conversations with my visiting relatives, friends, and computer. I've been up for 14 hours, which for me isn't unusual but feels strangely off. ::yawwwwwwwwwwwn::

Bought new tunes today. Found the surprising gem that is the Fiery Furnaces mis-shelved in the B&N, but then I wouldn't have found it if I'd actually been looking for it. I've come to believe that the best things are found without looking for them simply because they have the added surprise of delight. 

I will read M&M before bed because then I will be able to have a leisurely Sunday, including a much anticipated trip to Urban Outfitters, my new Mecca."

Oscar party! Glam! Should be soooo exciting, I've never been to a real Oscar party before, with lots of people in costume. So much pressure!

I discovered the magical place that is Steak and Shake, except the fries sucked. I had a really thick chocolate milkshake which was tasty. And there were all these GBN people there and they'd just clobbered us at basketball. Awkward!!!

I just finished a movie that was very funny. Dinner with Mom was fun, I put the Postal Service on and we danced around the kitchen which was nice.

There is so much work to do for so many things and then I'll finally get it finished only to go on the orch trip and have it build up again. At least I'll have that free day next Tuesday for sleep and other things. After that things should get back to normal, or at least I hope so. 

Listening to the Chocolat soundtrack, I realize that I really need to watch that movie again. And eat chocolate. Especially that!"

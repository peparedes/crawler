"event","so im talking to derick on the phone and im bored and all of a sudden kellie asks me if i remember that i still had a live journal and i realized i had completely forgotten so i decided i would start one up again. anyway so derick is now fighting with his sister and his sister is trying on like 15 pairs of clothing and he is beating her with a stick and she cant even feel it through all the clothing she is wearing. this weekend was a very productive one i cleaned te entire weekend and i am still not done it sucks. but today was my first day of drivers ed and man it sucked so bad it was really boring and all i learned was that the octagon means stop and the triangle means slow down and the arrow with the words ""one way"" written on it means that you can only go the direction indicated on the sign. lol but i get my permit in like 2 weeks and man im happy but im really tired and im tired of sitting like this and my contacts are starting to hurt so im gonna sign off for tonight but hey ill try to keep up with this stupid thing night all."

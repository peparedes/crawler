"event","<i>The nightmare is upon us.

A few days ago, a wretched abomination attacked me when I was in Shattrath and I was lucky enough to happen upon a healer of the Dawn in my state of weariness. Members of the Dawn and my sister, Aurora cared for me while I recovered from the fever that nearly took hold of my entire being. It was two days before I was well enough to be reunited with my children and Dor'ano. I bade him to stay with them to keep them safe. 

The healers worked hard to keep my constitution within me. To not lose me to the plague that threatened to take me with it. My body burned with a fever I have never experienced. My mind flooded with images vile and disturbing. My sleep was haunted with nightmares that surpassed all I had witnessed before this. Despite their best efforts, I still bear a scar. A wound from the attack. It has not been healed no matter what they have tried.

All the research that Dor'ano and I have done was to prepare for what would come in the north. Never did we imagine that the attacks would happen here. We were not ready for this. No one was. So many have fallen to the plague. Many more will follow after. There seems to not be enough healers and the armies we amass to combat the legion is dwindling down.

When I am well, I will meet with Tarquin. I am more determined than ever before to gain the new skills I need to go forward. To meet the challenges of the north. To fight harder than ever I have before. To protect what I love and hold dear. 

I may still wear that bloody scar upon my skin, but I will use it as a reminder. Of what I will fight against and overcome. Arthas brought the battle to us... and soon, we shall bring the battle back to him. We will not falter. We will not fade. We will not be crushed.

For now, I stay close to Dor'ano and the children. I try to ease the worry that I see etched upon the faces of those I care for. I recover as best I can. And do my best, to keep hope in my heart.. despite all I have seen and felt that we will overcome. In the end."

"event","<i>Dor'ano and I found some time on our hands and decided to pursue another of my pet projects together. I continue to take dirt samples and study them in the hopes that I can discover what may be happening in Quel'danas and if there is some connection to the rumors we are hearing about the lich king possibly raising up an army once more.

We started our trek from the troll stronghold of Zul'Aman. I still find those buildings so beautiful and wonderous to behold. I could have stayed there alone just to sit and stare. But we had a mission and were hoping to trace the scar as far as we could, which meant traveling into the Quel'dori held lands. We are going to consider the idea of a trek just exploring more of the trollish creations when we have time again. But time does seem fleeting and hard to come by these days.

Into the ""Ghostlands"" we wandered, pausing for me to take a sample of some mushrooms I found as well as a bit of soil which seemed to have a strange green glow to it. It reminded us both of Felwood. The taint was definitely present but it seemed to not have an entire foothold upon the land itself. Though I will say that the animals, like in many realms affected by corruption were indeed very aggressive and wild looking. Such a shame.

The map I had procured from a goblin I came across in Shattrath turned out to be utterly useless. I had nothing thought to check the makers mark upon the bloody thing. It was something created... before... the scar was created and therefore there was no mention of where we could find it. If I see that little fiend again, he is certainly going to hear a thing or two from me.

Thankfully, we did not need to wander very far into the woods before the scar became obvious to us in the distance. I should not say thankfully however as I was definitely not thankful to see such devistation. 

Tis the same as in other regions. A long path of... nothingness. The soil seeming tilled up, the plant life and anything else that may have been living there, destroyed, burnt and left to rot. I originally though I saw some stones in the dirt, only to discover, with horror, that they were in fact skeletal remains. This just... went on for as far as the eye could see. 

Once thing remains glaringly obvious, the scourges hold upon the areas affected deepest still remains strong as it was when they marched. Their minions still wander these trenches, for what purpose I cannot seem to understand. 

We followed the darkened land in one direction, choosing it entirely at random, only to find ourselves watching a fortress rise up from the ground, towering over everything around it. Skulls crafted from the same stone as the walls. It was foreboding and awful to see. I certainly had no desire to see inside, but Dor'ano was persuasive. He said that if we were to truly see what this was about, we needed to explore further. And he is right. However, if I could have turned the other way, I certainly would have.

Guards of various degree and nature were everywhere. Creatures of the scourge were wandering about, seemingly ready for a fight. And the inner buildings of this compound were almost as awful as the gate that greeted us. We made our way through it, trying to draw as little attention to ourselves as we could. Cauldrons, like those in the plaguelands were bubbling, brewing up some liquid I could not identify. And the green glow was present in the soil there, only to a much higher degree than what I had seen in the forest leading to this place. 

Two towers with crystals hovering in the air above them, called our attention. The energy surrounding the crystal seemed to flow into the tower itself as if it was being channeled or harnessed. As silently as we could manage, Dor'ano and I pressed into one of the towers, determined to see if we could figure out what the use of it was.

Several conjurers were focused into their spells and indeed it seemed to us that we were using the crystals energies to infuse the soil beneath with some.. fel energy. It disturbed me greatly to think that they were busy doing such things and I can't help but wonder what the reasoning behind it could possibly be.

My first instinct was something to do Arthas. I could only pray to Elune that I was wrong.

We left the tower and crept around the grounds further, deeper inside, moving toward a building which seemed to occupy the very heart of it all. It was the darkest and more powerful looking build of them all. The energy that radiated from it was definitely not welcoming to either of us. But we had come that far, we needed to see more if we were going to remotely answer the questions that lingered in our minds.</i>

"event","<i>As I was spending time at the lab in Quel'danas, I found myself chatting with another alchemist about salves and tinctures. In particular, I was expressing my frustration in not being able to find the right balance with the salve I am using to help treat Branwynne. I never mentioned her name, nor did I state her ailment, but I expressed a desire to make a more potent and yet less toxic creation. He suggested I make my way to Thelsamar. Apparently a dwarven alchemist there has come up with a very special salve which he will teach others to make if they prove their worth.

It seemed to me to be a good path to pursue. Since, well.. Branwynne is a dwarf. Perhaps this salve will be something that will help her in specific. Again, all I can do is try.

Shortly after I finished with my testing, I was on my way to Thelsmar. I found the master alchemist, Ghak Healtouch, in his home and greeted him after he invited me inside. I told him of my desire to learn how to make his salve and asked if he would teach me. He seemed a very nice fellow and only asked me to gather a few materials together for him in exchange for the lesson.

The strangest of the contents was dragon's blood. I cannot express how far down my jar dropped when this man requested this particular ingredient. At first, I thought he was joking... yet he just nodded pointed back to the list. 

Hells. Dragons.

So.. to the badlands I wandered, list in hand. My mind reeling a little as I pondered just how sound this was. To treat her with dragon's blood? I almost turned back around and gave up the quest until I realized that this was not about me and my issues. It tis about Branny. And helping her however I can. Ghak certain knew more about dwarven alchemy than I ever could imagine. And so I had to trust a little.

The dragons were easy enough to find as they circled a spot in the corner of the badlands. Giant drakes which would have, at one time, frightened me a little to see. But compared to some of the sights I have seen now.. they were rather unimpressive.

I found a spot to stand, just out of their view and I readied myself. My mind focusing as I channeled nature's energies into me, determined to bring sleep to the nearest beast. When I had him incapacitated, I moved in closer and grabbed for the needle. 

Dragon's blood.

I struck the needle into the rough hide, watching closely to see if the shock would wake the dragon from slumber. Thankfully the spell was strong and he did not budge. In fact, he barely twitched. I did what needed to be done and then I moved away quickly, leaving him to wake up with me far out of sight.

Back to Ghak's house with the materials he asked for, laying them all out on the table before him. I watched curiously as he began to grind things up and boil them together. His methods were certainly far different than my trainers in Darnassus. However, I enjoyed watching him and was grateful when he handed the recipe to me with a smile. 

The salve is much less odorous than my own. I am not certain of the potency when it comes to Branwynne, but it is worth a try I think. I will bring by some to her tomorrow and check again to make sure that things have not grown worse.

Elune will guide our course. I believe that."

"event","Alishe sat down the pencil and stared at the open page before her. She had read the words at least a few dozen times and still, she lingered there almost as if she was hoping something new would come from reading it just once more.

<i>Branny's demeanor has not improved dramatically. But one can scarcely blame her for it. Considering what she has been through and what she is dealing with currently, I am afraid that anyone would be much the same. 

The treatments continue, with no visual improvement. However, it does not seem to be getting worse. So for the moment, we wait.. and see. I try to have as much hope as I can for this to be something we can control and hopefully one day push back, ideally into non-existence. But there lingers an ever present reality that the worst is likely yet to come.

I try to steady myself for the possibilities, all the while keeping my hope that they will never come to pass. But I am a realistic girl. These are demonic energies we are dealing with. Uncertainty is always going to be a constant part of this journey.

I continue to work on my salve recipe, in the hopes I can make something a little less... disconcerting to the senses. I know Branny cannot be very happy having to use it so often as she does and while she does not complain, I hope that by making it a little easier in one way, I can help ease her.. even if just a little.

The current mixture is the following: Dreamfoil, Teroc...""</i>

She rubbed her temple and moaned a little as the tension in her head started to throb. Perhaps some steelbloom. That was a fragrant herb which may counter some of the stronger bitter herbs she was using.

Prydion came into the room and walked up behind his wife, gently pressing his hands on to her shoulders. He started to massage and whispered. ""Ishura, ye are still staring at that book? Ye should come outside I think. Spend some time in the garden, aye?"" With a soft sigh, she nodded and leaned back in the chair, her head pressing against him. ""I am glad you came in when you did, Dor'ano. It feels good to have you near.""

He smiled and leaned down to kiss her cheek, nuzzling his nose against her neck. ""Have ye got your bags packed for the trip, Ishura? I know that is weighing heavy on ye mind as well."" She closed her eyes and took a long breath. ""Mmm hmm. Just do not let me forget to bring my book with me. It has information I promised to give Genise and Ilarra when we meet with them."" He took her hand and urged her from the chair. ""Aye, su rini, I will remind ye.""

Alishe rose slowly and moved into Prydion's arms, hugging him tightly with a contended sigh. As she pulled back and smiled to him, he watched her face carefully. ""Still not sleeping well, Ishura? Ye look a bit weary to me."" She nodded just a little. ""Bloody dreams keep on nagging me. I find it hard to rest as I should. I still cannot believe Ilarra tried to give me potions!"" He brushed a dark indigo curl from her face. ""Maybe ye should have taken it from her. It couldn't have hurt."" Alishe smirked at him. ""I can make my own teas, Dor'ano. It is fine. When we make this trip, hopefully the dreams will end and I can rest again. For now... I will endure what I must.""

Arms wrapped around her as he drew her close once more, not knowing what to say. He hated to see her in distress. She smiled at him as their foreheads met. It almost seemed as if they drew energy from one another and it was several moments before they finally pulled apart. With a soft smile and a gentle kiss, Prydion led Alishe out of the room. 

The book lay open on the desk, discarded for now.

<i>I will check on Branny again tomorrow and then finish getting everything ready for our journey. All I can hope is that Elune will continue to guide us as she has and that we will find the cause to these dreams. 

Hyjal... awaits. Another trek will come soon. I hope I will be ready."

"event","<i>So, a saying I have heard is that you can never go back again from whence you've came. The past is the past. And for all the time I've lived, tis been true. Mind you, before our immortality was lost, it seemed as if time did not move at all for us. We were as we always had been. Babies were born and people grew older, but journey without end left us.. wanting.

At least that is how I feel.

There are some places in my past that I never truly wish to see again. Nor step foot upon. But tonight, I found myself called to one of the very worst of those things.. left behind. 

Hyjal.

Bloody hell. My heart still races a little when I think of the name, let alone speak of it. To stand there, on ground that was so close to one of the worst experiences of my life. My stomach was in knots. My head was light. And I wanted so badly to just turn and run away. 

Dor'ano kept steady watch on me and he was constantly reassuring to me. We were called there to attempt to right something gone wrong. To ensure victory. But in my heart, all I can see is devastation. The past. So many voices silenced for all time. So many lives lost. So much destroyed.

I cannot find a way to be happy being there. I cannot make peace with how I feel thinking that we must indeed venture back. My heart feels so weary and heavy.

We will soon venture back there. Travel back through their bloody time portals and march further toward the worst of the battle. We will soon find ourselves in the Kaldorei encampment. And tis very likely that I may see those who I once knew and cared for. Standing there along side of us, once more. Knowing that I can do naught to ease their fate. I cannot change it despite the fact that we are attempting to change other things.

This disturbs me greatly.

Tis hard enough to accept such things when they are gone and in the past. But to relieve it once more. Knowing that you still are unable to do a bloody thing to make it better? I am not sure how to make peace with that.

I suppose in the end. It will be a matter of what it always come down to.

A question of time."

"event","<i>The past few weeks have been quite the whirlwind of activity for Dor'ano and myself. It seems harder than ever for us to find time to just relax. However, I am most happy to say that we have finally decided to find time just for us. A few simple picnics in quiet places where we have sat with one another, sharing our thoughts and re-discovering one another once more. 

We somehow tried to be content with simply doing our tasks and fighting battles side by side, but lacked taking time away from those things. And now that we have, I can truly say that it tis something I've needed and appreciate more than I can say. It is far too easy to allow everything to come before us. To get caught up in it all and to not strengthen our bond and connection. But we have made ourselves a promise that it will not longer be the way of it. We will give ourselves the gift of each other.

This one simple act has helped us both to dissolve fear and worry that has wondered into our minds and hearts. It is still amazing to me to think on the fact that soon I shall have shared three years of marriage with my beloved Dor'ano. To think, when I began writing in this book, I had no idea where my life would head or what I would do. And now tis three years later. And I am more in love with this man than I have ever been. I watch him as a father to our children and it makes my heart swell to see such tenderness and caring. I listen to him speak and I truly admire his passion. I learn something new about him every single day and I never grow tired of being near him. 

It is my hope that mayhaps in a few months, Dor'ano and I can hold a gathering to celebrate such a wonderful milestone with our friends and family. I think perhaps it would be nice for others to take time away from all this battling and hardship to just relax and enjoy life a little as well. 

But in the meanwhile, the hardship goes on and we soldier on with it.

Tarquin called a meeting last week to discuss a few things. One of which was trying to sort out what we felt and thought about the situation in Quel'danas. Having spent much time there, I must admit I am a bit dreadful of delving deeper into the future of that place. I cannot help it though. I find myself drawn there and feel almost compelled to end whatever plan it is that Kael'thalas has for that place. The sunwell will not rise again. Or at least I hope it does not. 

I fear it will be much like Staghelm's ill-fated plan to restore our immortality by creating a new world tree. As of yet, the corruption and repercussions of such an act has not been full revealed, but I feel it is only a matter of time. And to see the sunwell rise up once again. Bloody hell, I fear what it will mean to the Quel'dori. Who already have had such struggle with addiction. I cannot see it being used for a good cause and I truly do fear what would come next if it were to be reborn in any manner.

I promised the riders that I would study the soil in Quel'danas and see what I could find out. Especially in the scar zone itself where so many of the scourge have risen up. When next I venture there, I intend to see about setting up a small space to test and experiment what I find there, so as not to bring any of it back home. I have a strong feeling that whatever corruption lies there is not something we should transplant if it can be at all helped.

So, that has begun and we shall see in the new few weeks what it is that I can discern from it. Compared to some of the suggestions that came from my guildmates, I'm afraid my... contribution.. is rather timid and mild. Sometimes I worry about them. Bloody brash if you ask me and more often than not, they get themselves in quite a lot of trouble. But I stand by them.. and always will. For they are my truest friends, even if they may be a bit rough around the edges.

A mystery has also surfaced involving our dear friend, Branwynne. Something has come over her and I'm afraid she is fighting hard to keep us at bay, despite our pure desire to help her. More and more, tis looking as if some swift and potentially difficult action will be have to be  taken. I am unsure what exactly we are facing, but unfortunately a few gnomes have gotten involved and have unknowingly made the situation worse with their attempts to solve the mystery with science. While I do applaud their creativity and desire to help, when dealing with such things as what Branny is, tis truly not the best to dive in without full understanding and knowledge of the situation at hand.

I will write more as I sort though it. For now, I fear I must go consult a book I have not picked up in quite some time. Hopefully, it will yield some better answers, though I am quite doubtful that it will give me anything but more unhappy and disturbing news."

"event","<i>This morning, I received a summons from the Cenarion Expedition. Specifically from Morthis Whisperwing himself, who is a powerful druid of the talon. Honestly? I was not looking forward to this meeting, as months had passed since I last spoke to him and it was not a pleasant conversation. 

When I came to him back then, I had just found comfort in flying and was getting used to it when he stripped me of my ability to take the form. He felt that I was unready and undeserving of it. That I had things to learn and needed to prove myself. I could not recall the last time I had to do such a thing! I was infuriated. Frustrated and frankly, angry. How dare he!

The man spoke to me in such a manner that it brought Staghelm himself to mind. Bloody biter man. I know not what I ever did to provoke such a thing from him, but he did not seem to care for me one bit.

So I left the expedition, exalted with all else but him. I had no choice but to take myself to the Wildhammer clan and beg of them a mount to use until such time as I figured out whatever it was that I needed to do to prove myself worthy of flight once more. They seemed to be very amused by my plight. I suffered more than a few insults and when they finally realized that I was most serious and actually indeed needed their aid, they finally relented and entrusted me with a beautiful gryphon whom they apparently called Helix. Bloody strange name if you ask me. But it seems to fit him well.

Helix has been my companion for so long now, it is difficult to think that after today, I shall no longer be needing him. In fact, tonight, I will return to the Wildhammers and bring Helix home to them. I am trying not to think on it too long for it will bring tears to my eyes.

But I am getting ahead of myself.

I hesitated in responding to the summons, but Dor'ano was insistent that I not delay any longer. He felt that this was important and that perhaps it would finally be time for me to earn my right to be in the sky under my own power once more. I was not so convinced. But I went anyway. Dreading every single step I took toward that man.

Morthis Whisperwing greeted me with a bow when I arrived and the smile that had been on his lips just moments before, faded fast. ""Alishe, you have left a task undone for far too long. I know not why you have abandoned the quest I charged you with, nor why you seemingly have decided that this is not something you care about. But I have called you here to ask once more, will you prove your worth?"" His eyes bore into me like knives and I stood there, a bit stunned.

All I could whisper was, ""Bloody hell."" He smirked at me. ""That is not the reply I was hoping for."" I cleared my throat and did my best to explain my confusion. At his demeanor. At his taking something from me by force which I felt I had earned. I told him how difficult it had been for me. How bloody embarassing! He listened to all of my rant and then held up his hand to silence me from continuing onward.

""You wonder why the ravens took their gift and yet you still do not have peace within yourself."" He paused and his eyes actually softened a bit. ""Think, Alishe. Think hard on this."" I sighed then. Remembering a revelation I had come upon a few months back. ""One cannot fly when you are weighted to the world with guilt and woe."" I bit my lip and looked at him again. Unsure of what to say or do.

To my surprise, he smiled and nodded his head. ""Exactly. I had no doubt you would figure it out eventually, Alishe. But you sometimes do not listen without being pushed. Hard."" I raised my eyebrows at him in shock. How could this man know a thing about me! We had never spoken before the day he chastised me so. He chuckled in response. ""Rabine talks about you Alishe. And I listen."" I blinked in surprise and shock. My mentor was the one who told him to do this? Bloody hell! 

He motioned for me to sit down next to him and then smiled once more. ""Now, I will try again. Softer this time for I can see you are overwhelmed by all of this."" He turned and faced me. ""Are you ready to take on the challenge I gave you? To earn your right to be part of the talon. To TRULY earn your place among us?"" I swallowed hard and nodded slowly. I was afraid he would yell once more or tell me I was not ready.

Morthis nodded in response to my words. ""Then gather your aid, Alishe. No more delays. No more waiting. Today. It must be today. Do you understand me?"" I caught my breath. All these months of preparation I should have been doing. And I had not done any. I had let it slip past. I started to panic and then as I caught his glance, I realized that was not going to help my cause. So a deep breath was next on my mind. Calming my heart and mind as I thanked him for the chance to show I was worthy. I rose up and headed to find Helix, anxious to find Dor'ano.

I had no idea how difficult or easy the journey would be. Nor who I would gather with me. But I was blessed by Elune I suppose. The aid came quickly and before I knew it, Varenna, Isi, Calen'braga and my beloved Dor'ano were at my side, ready to take on the fight with me. I could not have asked for more. 

The battle against Anzu was a bit more than I was prepared for. As soon as I stated I was ready to battle, a great portal opened up above us. It was dark.. and rather terrifying to see. I tried not to be afraid, but my heart was beating so quickly. But I embraced my fear and I decided that I would use it to help me endure this fight. Whatever came next. And when Anzu appeared before us, I was ready.

It seemed like it took ages to defeat him and his minions. We fought hard and together in every way. And when the dust finally settled and he was vanquished, I could not help but cry. We had done it! The task was done. And now I would see if Morthis would find me worthy to fly.. once more.

I quickly made my way back to him, anxious to see what he would say. To my shock, he chastized me for how long I had taken to decide I was ready. My heart sunk and I sighed, lowering my eyes from his face. ""Alishe."" He called to me, causing me to look at him again. ""We are proud of you.  Listen to them, Alishe. They are calling for you to join them."" He nodded as I stared in disbelief. ""Ask them for their aid. And they will help you to fly once more.""

With closed eyes, I whispered to the ravens flying nearby. Asking for guidance. Thanking them for their confidence in me. And requesting from them, my renewed ability to take to the sky. I held my breath. And waited.

The vision of a bird in flight filled my mind and I felt such a sudden rush of wind on my face. I gave myself over to it, wholly. Completely. I was one of the talon. I had earned my place amongst their numbers and for the first time, I was comfortable. My eyes opened then and I found myself high above the ground. Hovering there. My wings flapping in the wind, keeping me steady. The sound of the ravens nearby growing louder as they circled me.

I earned my wings today.

And I am complete."

Before I began this entry, I sat down to glance back at all I had written and shared in this beloved diary of mine. Some entries brought me to tears and others, made me smile or outright laugh. Tis good to see where one has been. To be able to judge the distance that you have come. The changes of our life and to note what has come before the now.

My house is still for the moment. I am enjoying the brief reprieve from the hustle and bustle that life has become. It seems we are always in motion these days. Either chasing after Rowan and Kareelin. Attempting to keep the cats from mischief which they seem to excel at. Or being called to yet another place to fight.

The children have gone out to play with Sylang, who has been the most wonderful caregiver for them that I could have asked for. I am so grateful for her patience and the time she gives to us. Meanwhile, Dor'ano is next to me, napping after a grueling morning. I had thought to rest as well, but a strange dream woke me from slumber. It seems to be the norm as of late. My dreams are wild and often unpredictable. But they also seem to be the way that Elune gives me messages. So, I will ponder this one for a while and mayhaps find rest with my Dor'ano shortly.

It feels good to write once more. I should do so more often."

"event","Slowly Alishe came out of her dream, her eyes not open yet. She could feel the tiniest bit of movement next to her causing her to smile. Exahusted eyes opened and she glanced upon the tiny face of her son. Somehow she had fallen asleep with Rowan next to her again. He wasn't fussing, yet, and seemed content to just look around and squirm. ""Good morning Rowan."" She whispered to him as she leaned in close to nuzzle his soft newborn skin with her nose. Tiny hands immediately reached out to grasp a huge chunk of her hair.

""Yeouch!"" She giggled as she tried to unclasp the death grip Rowan had upon her. He was most definitely a strong child. As was his sister. ""Let go, little one. Ow. Ow. Ow. No wonder so many mothers cut their hair at this point. Ow!"" It took a few moments, but eventually Alishe freed herself and her hair from his hands. She grinned and brushed her fingertips against his face. ""So sweet you are. Even if you are trying to make your mother bald!""

Prydion's chuckle caused her to glance across the room. He was sitting in a chair with Kareelin asleep in his arms. Obviously she had not allowed him to sleep very well either. ""O fulo osa su alah'ni."" Alishe smiled as she scanned his face. She should have made sure he went to bed as well. He looked as tired as she felt. His eyes still sparkled though as he looked to her. ""I love ye too Ishura."" He rose cautiously and settled Kareelin into the craddle as Alishe watched him silently, her hand now the newest playtoy for their son.

""When does Sylang come?"" Prydion whispered as she drew near to the bed, smiling down at Rowan as tiny arms reached upward. Alishe started to stretch and a huge yawn escaped her lips. ""Soon, I would think. I suppose I should straighten up a little before she arrives, aye?"" Prydion grinned as he brushed something out of Rowan's hand. ""He got you good this time, Ishura. Look at all this hair he robbed ye off!"" Alishe laughed. ""Yes, he has quite the grip. Just hope he doesn't do the same to you!"" She winked as Prydion's eyebrows raised up. A gigglefit soon took hold as Prydion gave his soon a stern but playful look. ""Don't ye even think on it, son. I like me hair where it is!""

Alishe laid back into bed and snuggled in against the pillow. All she wanted was a few more hours of sleep. ""Have ye had your belly filled, me little lad?"" Prydion slowly raised up the baby from Alishe's arms. ""Mmm hmm. He should be fine for at least a little while now."" Alishe murmured back sleepily, her eyes closing once more. She could barely feel his hand coming down to brush against her forehead as her mind drifted back off again. Sleep taking her prisoner and not letting loose. ""Rest yeself Ishura. O fulo osa."" He whispered as she leaned over to kiss her cheek. 

She nearly jumped when she heard him yelp. Rowan had grabbed hold of his father's hair this time. ""Ye. Ow. Son! Hell!"" Alishe couldn't help but giggle. She didn't have her eyes open but she could imagine the scene even still. Prydion grunted as he tried to get the claw-like grip of his son to release his precious hair from it's grasp. However, Alishe never found out how long it took for her husband to free himself fully. By that point, she had long since been asleep."

"event","She watched silently as his brow furrowed again. His closed eyes tightened slightly and his breathing increased. Always so restless as of late. That was her Dor'ano. Her hand moved slowly and fingertips brushed against his cheek very lightly. ""Shhh Dor'ano. O fulo osa."" Then just as suddenly, he relaxed again. It seemed to be ever the case as of late. She found that it was her husband that kept her up at night more than her sleeping newborns.

Alishe turned her head and glanced over at the cradle which contained the slumbering twins. Snuggled up together, they were happily dreaming. Their soft breathing echoed in the quiet room and she couldn't help but smile. How sweet they were. How fragile. They had been born early. Of that there was no doubt, they were absolutely tiny. Surprising considering how huge Alishe had felt in the last weeks of her pregnancy. Then again, she had no idea that all the random movement and internal beatings she was enduring was actually the product of two little ones.

Prydion and Alishe had worked hard to care for the babies and to use their healing energies combined to strengthen their children. Almost a month had passed and they were very relieved to see that both Prydrowan and Kareelin were very healthy and growing stronger every day. 

From beside her, Prydion groaned again and her attention turned back to him. She pressed herself against her husband, wrapping her arms around him. Almost as if on instinct alone, his arms moved to embrace her tightly. His body starting to respond to the feel of her against him. Alishe brushed her lips against his neck and paused, sighing ever so softly. Certainly she could wake him up at this point, but she hesistated to do so. After all, rest seemed to come so rare to Prydion. She kissed his neck and heard him murmur in his sleep. Something inbetween a whimper and a moan. His hand roaming along the bare skin of her back and coming to rest upon her hip. It was then he whispered something to her which made her grin.

He was awake. And it was rather obvious. 

Amorous kisses soon followed and it was safe to say that it was not only Prydion who was enjoying the fact that Alishe's body was returning back to her normal form. As often happened with Alishe and Prydion, soon there was nothing else but the two of them in each other's arms. 

That is.. until...

""Waaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!""

Alishe's forehead came to rest against Prydion's shoulder with a soft thunk and they both began to snicker softly. Reality came back to them swiftly, in the form of Rowan's howl. She opened her eyes and turned her head toward the cradle, only to see that Kareelin too was starting to stir. ""Ye were too loud, Ishura."" Prydion whispered with a wicked grin. Alishe jabbed him playfully in the side. ""I think not, Dor'ano. If anyone woke them, it was you!"" Again came Rowan's hunger call as Alishe reached for her nightgown.

""Shhh. Yes, fulo. I'm coming."" His sister soon joined and the house began to be filled with the sound of newborn wailing. A very tired Prydion pulled himself from bed, quickly dressing himself as well and then scooping up his daughter who squirmed and fussed in his arms. He kissed her forehead and smiled at Alishe who had settled down with Rowan, nursing him almost as if it was second nature. Even that had not be easy for Alishe, but she had endured the difficulty like a champ and Prydion couldn't help but sigh happily at the sight. ""O fulo osa, su rini. Ye are truly beautiful. I hope ye know that."" Alishe's eyes met his and she smiled brightly at him.

Kareelin cried out loudly, eager for her turn. Her father walking around the room, trying his best to soothe her into submission as he waited for Alishe to finish with her brother. After a little while, the new parents swapped babies and Alishe went to work on sating her very fussy daughter. Prydion plunked wearily down in a chair, patting Rowan's back in a half-hearted attempt to burp him. But every pat got softer and softer until they ceased entirely. 

A soft smile and a very faint chuckle came from Alishe as she watched the two men in her life snoozing before her. Her hand brushing against the fine soft hair of infant still nursing happily away. Kareelin finished her meal and soon she too was back in happy slumber. Very quietly and carefully, Alishe lifted up her daughter and settled her back in the cradle, soon after to be joined by her sibling.

With quiet footfalls, Alishe crossed the room again and reached out her hand brushing it lightly against Prydion's hair, her lips curled up in a adoring smile. He moved just a little then, his hand coming to capture hers, pulling her rather swiftly upon his lap. He nuzzled her neck with his lips and murmured sleepily at her. She wrapped her arms around him and whispered softly in response. ""Later love. Later."" Her frowned just a little, but it didn't last for long as he could not argue with his fatigue. With a yawn, Alishe led them both back to their bed and curled up in his arms, happy to just be close to him.

And soon the entire house was filled with the sound of contented sleep."

"event","((I need to start by thanking everyone for the amazing fun rp last night! I never thought I'd say that about labor. *grins* But that truly without a doubt was one of the most funny and enjoyable nights I've had in a while. I needed the laughs you gave me and I so appreciate the amazing roleplaying everyone did. Not to mention the patience you all showed while we waited for Prydion!

This story is not written by me alone. Some of it is retold from screenies I managed to take while we went along. I only wish I could have taken more because I'm sure that I've missed something! I can only hope that I got Calaria's accent right, and I'll double check to make sure.

I might be fixing things up as I go, but I wanted to get this first draft out to everyone since I know that quite a few people were anxious to read it!

Enjoy and thank you again, especially Calaria, Aurora, Isewyn, Alistair and Aradna who escorted Alishe all the way from Menethil to their house in Ashenvale! What fun! :) ))

Soft grunting noises from the other side of the room began to wake Alishe from her dreams. Squinting, Alishe opened one eye and gazed blearily over toward the cradle that held her newborns. The other eye opened and she smiled as she watched Prydion lift one of their children up, cradling the swaddled baby in his arms. He had truly taken to fatherhood so naturally. It was almost as if he had done it before.

The night had been a long one, filled with fussing from the babies and tears from Alishe as she struggled with figuring out how to nurse two newborns at once. Hormones were getting the best of her. But Prydion just continued to be the voice of calm, reassuring his wife that all would be well. The couple would finally get to sleep when one or both of the twins would awake again, needing some sort of tending to.

""Ohhh.. I feel. I feel like I just..."" Prydion grinned at his wife as he laid the baby gentle into Alishe's arms. ""Ye feel like ye gave birth to twins, aye?"" Alishe laughed softly. ""Aye, and then some."" She took a deep breath and loosened the top of her nightgown. ""I can do this."" Her son was now beginning to squawk from hunger. ""Aye, Ishura. Ye can."" Prydion brushed his hand against her hair and smiled at them both. With another deep breath, Alishe managed to get the baby settled into nursing. The sensation was going to take some getting used to. A few times Alishe bit her lip almost to the point of making it bleed because the pain. Calaria had assured her that she would adjust and soon it wouldn't hurt at all.

""Just breathe, su rini. Just breathe."" Alishe was so grateful for his constant support and encouragement. She stared down at the tiny hand which gripped her finger, her mind still a whirl at all that happened just less than a day ago.

It had started like any other day. Alishe sleeping very little after a night of discomfort. The contractions coming and going. She told herself she should be used to them by now. She had been feeling them for weeks, but it was a bit different that morning. They were starting to get very regular. Like clock work. And the intensity was.. overwhelming at times. But she kept telling herself that it would eventually stop and go away. It had been the way of things.

A walk in the garden had not managed to lessen her restlessness and so Alishe slowly made her way to Stormwind. The streets were filled with those in costumes, laughing and making merry. She tried to smile back, but her mind was filling with distress. Dor'ano had left early to gather a few things for her and she was missing him horribly for some reason.

Pain seized Alishe and she leaned against the wall behind her. Silently she counted, a habit she had taken to since these pains had begun. It was her way of comforting herself into remembering that it would not last forever. The pain climaxed to a point where she was clenching her jaw and tears began to appear at the edges of her tightly closed eyes.

When it finally passed, Alishe forced herself to breathe again, nearly started by the sudden cackling of a woman nearby as she flirted with her companion. Alishe's hand rested against her very large stomach. ""You have to move, Alishe. You have to go... home."" Although she couldn't see her feet and hadn't in quite some time, she willed them to take her to the flight master, who eyed Alishe warily. ""Are you sure you are fit to ride madam? Perhaps you should head to the cathedral?"" She sighed at him. ""No."" She said firmly. ""I have to go home!"" When he continued to argue with her over the fact that she looked as if she needed some immediate attention from a priest, Alishe glared and started to search her bags. She yanked out her hearthstone which was cool in her hand.

In the blink of an eye, Alishe was standing in Menethil, the place that she, Meep and Prydion had once called home. Ages ago it seemed, before Meep had gone off to travel the world with her mother Reeza. Alishe smiled as she thought of her adopted daughter, missing her horribly. She would have to read the latest letter again when she got home. It would make her feel better.

""Miss Alishe, are you.. alright?"" The innkeeper reached out a hand toward Alishe's arm as she leaned against the wall, a sudden sharp pain taking hold of her stomach. ""Mmmm hmmm!"" Alishe whimpered and bit her lip as the pain soared to new heights. ""You know, the room you used to rent happens to be free. Maybe you should stay here until Prydion comes?"" In the midst of whimpers and a soft whine, Alishe nodded her head. At that point, she would have agreed to pretty much anything if it meant that the pain would lessen. ""Right."" The innkeeper nodded back and steadied Alishe against her, attempting to help her up the stairs to the room.

The comfort of the bed lasted only a moment before Alishe was restless again. The innkeeper had hesitantly left Alishe with several apologies, having to attend to others in the inn. Alishe tried to assure her that all was well, but she was becoming less certain of that herself.

The midwife that her mother had recommended had never contacted them. And Alishe was unsure of what to do when things were like this. No Dor'ano. No family. No one she knew close by. Panic was filling her to the brim as another spike of pain hit, taking her breath away with it. Alishe barely managed to speak to the others on the buzzbox as she paced the room. ""Walking. I need to walk."" She opened the door of her room and back down the stair she went. She could barely hear the protests of the innkeeper, who was attempting to settle out some dispute as she left the inn entirely.

The steps were so exhausting and each one brought a new pang or ache. She didn't want to move and yet, she could not remain still. This was confusing to say the least. She made her way to the water's edge, a place that often soothed her when times were rough and slowly lowered herself down to sit. She wasn't entirely sure that she'd be able to get back up, but at that moment in time, it felt like the right thing to do.

""Dor'ano.. where are you?"" She closed her eyes and released a long slow breath from her lips. The buzzbox was roaring with commotion suddenly. People asking after her as they realized that her being alone just might not be the best of ideas after all. ""Where are ye lass?"" Homrend asked, with obvious concern in his voice. ""At the inn."" Alishe answered back, whimpering as her stomach began to harden once more with the next contraction. Why they kept asking her that was beyond her at that moment. She was at the inn of course, how could they not understand!

It took several moments before someone finally caught on that Alishe was, in fact, in Menethil. ""Aurora, I need you."" Alishe whispered and bit her lip once again, wishing with all her might that someone she knew was with her. ""Dor'ano.."" She groaned loudly and tried to slow her breathing down. ""Lass?"" It was Aradna's voice that filled her ears suddenly. Alishe opened her eyes and stared at the dwarf in front of her. ""I know I'm nae the one you wanted ta see, but I'm here."" Alishe smiled, feeling a bit more relieved than she was prepared to admit at the moment. Before she could say much of anything, more pain took over her senses and Alishe whimpered loudly.

""We should get you inside, lass. Out here is nae a proper place ta birth."" Alishe could only whimper and groan in response. It took almost a minute before she could blurt out her words. ""No. Home! I must be home!"" Aurora's voice answered her. ""Why?"" Alishe gasped loudly and grabbed a hold of her big sister's hand, griping it very tightly. ""Because!"" She wailed as the worst of the pain began to subside once more.

Aurora gritted her teeth and attempted as best she could to console her little sister. Seeing her in pain and not being able to do a thing was something the huntress was not prepared for. ""Don't leave me. Please."" Alishe begged and stared into Aurora's eyes. ""I won't, Alishe. I promise."" Aurora smiled and tried to look calm, when her heart was racing so hard she thought it would burst entirely.

""My house is nae far from here, Alishe. We should take ye there."" Aradna was trying to help Alishe to her feet, but she was resisting, determined to have her way. ""Home. I have... to.. be.. home!"" Calaria joined the trio and greeted them all softly, immediately trying to assess the situation at hand. She could tell that it would not be long before Alishe would give birth and somehow they had to get her to a bed. They all attempted to convince Alishe that it was just too far and that the journey itself was too much to do right then.

Alishe just shook her head, determined to overcome the pain she felt and make it to the comfort of her home in Ashenvale. If she couldn't have her husband with her, she would at least have that. She could not endure the thought of anything less for the birth of her baby. Aurora helped her to her feet and she clung to her older sister, afraid to let go. ""Home, please. Aurora. Please."" Aurora sighed, resigned. ""Alright then. Let's go. You have to walk."" Alishe nodded and took a deep breath before willing her feet to move once more.

The trek was a very long and tedious journey from the shoreline to the dock. Alishe barely made it upon the boat before she gripped the side, hit with another contraction which nearly crumpled her to her feet. ""It's less rocky in the middle, Alishe."" Aurora called to her sister. ""But.. that means.. I have to walk.. over there!"" Alishe called back loudly. ""Just. Trying to help sis."" Aurora muttered back.

Calaria, Aurora and Aradna helped Alishe across the width of the boat as it docked, with Alistair and Isewyn nearby. Alistair was arguing that Alishe should give up the idea of going home and should instead go to Darnassus. ""Don't make me hit you, Alistair."" Alishe growled at him as he persisted despite her continued insistence that she had to be at home for this. ""I have a hard head, Alishe. You won't hurt me."" He quipped back. She paused and blinked at him. ""I can throw things. Hard."" Aurora shook her head and motioned for Alistair to stop. ""Trust me, she can. Let's just leave it at that shall we?""

Halfway to the inn of Auberdine, Alishe stopped cold and her eyes grew very wide. ""Waaa ter!"" The party around here looked at her in confusion. Some thinking she was about to faint, others reaching for something to drink. ""NO!! Water!"" Alishe whimpered out the words inbetween spasms of her stomach. Her cheeks were flushing as she realized her legs were now starting to become drenched.

""Keep walking, Alishe."" Her sister muttered. ""But.. my water broke!"" Alishe whined back. ""Well, being here won't help that. You have to keep going!"" Alishe sighed. Aurora was right of course. The steps to the inn were more difficult than the ones before them. How would she ever make it home? ""Banthalos"" Alishe whispered as she thought of her tiger companion. He would get her there.

""Isewyn, you must fly to Ashenvale. Aurora... We need to ride. I cannot fly."" They all looked on, worried. Alishe was being so stubborn, but they realized that continuing to argue would not help. Instead they all needed to work together in order to bring Alishe home. ""We'll go slow, Alishe. We'll go slow."" Aurora whispered comfortingly and Alishe nodded back. With a grunt, she managed to get herself on the back of her beloved tiger and whimpered softly as he began to move. It was going to be a long ride at this rate.

Barely outside out of Auberdine, Banthalos suddenly took off running, Alishe unable to stop him. ""Banthalos! NO!"" She screamed as they raced along the road. The bloody cat had lost his mind she thought to herself as the pain intensified. ""Get a reign on him!"" Aurora beloved to Alishe who was all but crumpling over on the saddle. ""STOP!"" Alishe screamed to the tiger, who suddenly stopped moving in order to avoid running fully into Aurora in front of him. He growled and bared his teeth to Aurora, which shocked everyone. ""What has gotten.. into.. you!"" Alishe whimpered.

""Let's go on. Slowly."" Aurora sighed. Alistair, Aurora and Aradna all rode along with Alishe, sending Calaria ahead of them to prepare the house for their arrival. The contractions were arriving faster now, leaving Alishe unable to speak much at all. Whimpers were the most that they got out of her much of the remaining trip. Alishe actually had to dismount from Banthalos altogether not long before they reached the house. With the assistance of her sister, Alishe finally stood in her doorway. Relief was obvious on her face.

""I'll see what I kin do about these pests around here, Alishe."" Aradna nodded and headed off without another word, determined to do something to help Alishe, even if it wasn't being in the room itself. After all, she wasn't good at birthing babies and knew nothing about the process. Alishe smiled weakly and nodded back as the dwarf huntress headed away.

""We should git ye into bed, lass."" Calaria called as Alishe took a stop forward. With a deep groan, Alishe settled upon the bed. Still no sign of her love. ""It won't be long now."" Calaria was wandering around trying to get things set up for the birth. ""But.. I can't.. do that yet!"" Alishe bellowed and nearly burst into tears. Aurora put her hand on her sister's arm. ""Nature will take it's course lass. You have to go with it."" More panic filled Alishe. She was going to have this baby without her husband.

""Dor'ano. You bloody bastard!"" She yelled suddenly when the next contraction reached it's peak. This had to end. She couldn't take any more. Aurora was looking panic stricken, not having any idea what to do to ease the suffering of her sibling. The men standing outside were nojt sure what to do next, so Calaria set them to boil some water for them.

The men fumbled and Alishe could actually see them running back and forth in front of the doorway to the house. Alishe and her sister blinked at one another. ""Don't they teach how to make a simple fire to humans"" Aurora smirked as Alistair blew on the fire trying to give it more air to burn. ""I heard that!"" He yelled back into the house.

""I think they got a fire goin'.. Mebee they're trying te make th' water boil faster?"" Calaria shrugged. ""Stop listening and more actual fire"" Aurora grumbled back at the men outside. ""Bubbles.. come on, bubbles..."" Alistair muttered as Alishe cried out very loudly, almost sitting up in her bed.

Aurora boggled at the fact that she was actually becoming used to the distressing sounds of her sister. ""This is normal.. right?"" She looked to Calaria as the dwarf wiped off Alishe's forehead with a damp cloth. ""Aye, it is. It's prolly gonna get much louder before everythin's done an over wit."" From outside, Alistair told Isewyn, "".. if the little guy did more than puff fire, I'd use him..."" He stared at his crimson whelping and pondered. ""Hmmm..."" Alistair then grabbed at the whelpling who tried to bite him. ""Yea... I'm thinking that's a no.""

Aurora sighed and shook her head. ""Why do I see several healing prayers coming out of this..."" Calaria rose slowly, chanting over Alishe as she writhed in pain, the worst of the latest contraction starting to hit the edge of her tolerance. ""I'm gonna try one nae.. mebee it'll calm ev'ryone down a wee bit.""

""By the light, I never thought I'd be so happy to see steam."" Alistair grinned as the water finally began to show signs of boiling. Alishe sighed a little, relaxing as the soothing of Calaria began to ease her just a little.

""They can face down corrupted trolls.. stand against the Blood God.. fight through the bowels of Blackrock Mountain. Light a fire? They couldn't do that with Ragnaros' help."" Aurora shook her head, smirking once more. ""I heard that too!"" Alistair grumbled toward the doorway. ""But you haven't said I'm wrong!"" She muttered back.

""Ye lads got it boilin' yet, eh?"" Calaria interrupted the quarreling pair. ""Fate is against us!"" Alistair called back. ""It's, uh.. it's coming."" Aurora snorted. ""The water or their tempers? One guess as to which is boiling."" It seemed as if Aurora was relaxing finally, taking comfort in her ability to go back to sarcasm once again.

""You're using wood.. right?"" She called to Alistair. ""I think they sold us defective firewood."" He muttered as he tried to poke at the wood in an attempt to make the fire burn hotter. ""NO! We're using troll flesh! Of course we're using wood!""

Alishe's cries silenced them all for a moment and Calaria grasped hold of her hand. Aurora, took hold of the other and muttered, ""Wouldn't surprise me."" then focused her attention upon Alishe who cried out ""Dor'ano!"" Calaria wiped her forehead and tried to calm Alishe down. ""Homrend should have found him by now, lass. He'll be here soon.""

""It's getting colder, isn't it... I just know it will.."" Alistair was still fumbling with the fire as it began to smoke far more than it was burning. ""Do you have tinder?"" Aurora rose up and peeked outside.
""Tinder? Men don't need tinder!"" Alistair growled, poking at the fire once again. ""If you don't have any, back in TOWN!"" Aurora was glaring at this point, getting rather frustrated with the men who couldn't seem to make the fire burn no matter what they did.

""An' get 'er a birthin' dress!"" Calaria called. Alishe snorted at the thought of her sister wearing a dress, only to realize that her sister was now glaring at her. Amusement didn't last long as the pain hit once more. She was now grunting and it even appeared that she was getting ready to start pushing. Calaria muttered, watching over Alishe. It wouldn't be long now.

""There! Uther's Blood, bubbles! I told you!"" Alistair seemed quite proud of himself. ""Bubbles... we have bubbles!"" Isewyn confirmed. ""Water's hot!"" Aurora rolled her eyes. ""Blowing in it with a straw doesn't count."" Alistair ignored the comment and stared blankly at Isewyn suddenly. ""Quick! Who's taking it in?"" Isewyn stared back. Neither of them moved for a moment and then suddenly Isewyn spoke. ""I will, I guess..."" He then fumbled around in his bag looking for something to put on his hands so they would not be burnt. ""Your courage will be remembered."" Alistair grinned as Calaria rolled her eyes. ""And so will your.. proficiency."" Aurora quipped. ""My... what?"" Isewyn asked as he entered the room cautiously. ""Nothing, just go."" Alistair nudged Isewyn as Calaria burst into laughter.

I ain't leavin' 'er side. Sae ye gotta come in!"" Calaria called to Isewyn as he continued to hover in the doorway, not moving one way or another. Aurora grinned to Isewyn. ""I won't shoot you, it's alright.. We need comedy in this world."" Isewyn was trying to avoid looking at Alishe who was starting to pant breathlessly on the bed. ""I.. erm..""

""Just put it down lad!"" Calaria called and put her focus back on Alishe. Isewyn did as she asked and quickly left the room. ""Ishura, I'm coming!"" Prydion finally called to Alishe over the buzzbox. Her eyes teared up briefly as relief washed over her. He would be here after all!

""I can't take it anymore!"" Alishe groaned more loudly than she had before and the grunting came again. ""Get ready lass. It's time!"" Calaria helped Alishe into position and soon she was starting to push. ""That's it. Push hard!"" Prydion ran into the room, stopping suddenly as he took in the sight before him. His mind whirled as he tried to grasp what he was seeing. ""Ishura! Are you alright? How are you feeling?""

""SHUT UP!"" Alishe yelled at everyone, grunting loudly as she pushed with all her might. ""I'm sorry."" She whimpered almost immediately afterward, trying to catch her breath inbetween contractions. ""It's alright lass. Just push!"" Calaria tried to soothe Alishe and encourage things onward as best she could.

The pain was overwhelming. The only thing that remotely lessened it was pushing and so that's all Alishe focused on. Making the pain stop. The men outside sat quietly, staring at the fire. Alistair humming softly as Isewyn stared into the flames, wincing every time he heard Alishe cry out.

""I can see the head!"" Calaria called out. ""Just keep pushin!"" Alishe screamed as the baby was born, a newborn cry suddenly filling the air. ""How is my son? Is he.."" Prydion called out as Calaria interrupted him. ""Ye have a lass Alishe!"" Alishe had collapsed back against her pillows and grinned wearily. She had been right after all! They had a daughter! ""What?"" Prydion blinked in disbelief as he stared at the wriggling infant in Calaria's arms. He continued to stare on as she was given over to Alishe.

A flood of emotion hit Prydion. It was so important to have a son. For the sake of his family. He had felt it within his entire being that his son would be born now. Slowly, he shook his head, trying to catch his breath. He didn't want Alishe to feel that she had let him down in any way and tried to smile reassuringly at her when she caught his eye.

This daughter was loved to be sure, but he couldn't help but feel some sense of loss at the idea that the son he dreamed of... the son that would help bring about peace to his ancestors had not been born after all. His eyes came to rest upon the face of his daughter. She was beautiful though.. Just like her mother. Slowly a smile crossed his lips. His daughter. He had a daughter. His eyes met Alishe's once more and the smile grew brighter. ""Ye did well, Ishura. She's beautiful. Just like you."" Alishe sighed happily.

""It is done"" Isewyn whispered to Alistair as the commotion inside settled down. Aurora grinned and reached out to brush her hand against her nieces forehead. ""Congratulations ta ye both!"" Calaria grinned. ""I'm so glad that's over..."" Alishe suddenly gasped and groaned once more. ""Dor'ano.. take her!"" The newborn was suddenly shifted to Prydion as Alishe cried out. ""BLOODY HELLLLL!!!!""

""What's this?"" Calaria blinked in disbelief. ""Another one is on the way!"" Alishe groaned and began to push again. ""Push, lass, push hard!"" Alishe gasped for air and almost started to cry. ""I.. can't. I can't!"" Calaria calmed herself in her excitement and looked into Alishe's eyes. ""Aye lass. Ye can. Just push."" And with that, Alishe began to push as hard as her body could muster.

Within a few moments, the cries of another infant filled the room. ""Ye have a boy!"" Prydion stared and almost had to catch his breath. He looked from Alishe who fell back against her pillows, looking very pale but so beautiful... to his daughter who cooed softly in his arms.. over to the squalling newborn in Calaria's arms. ""By the light! He is born! He's here!"" Prydion moved closer, almost afraid to believe it.

Both children were given over to Alishe who nuzzled and kissed them. Tears filled her eyes as she stared down at her newborns. Alishe had always been about balance. Finding balance within herself and within the world around her. To finally have her laboring done only to discover that she had indeed been carrying both a son and a daughter all this time.. was it's own beautiful balance in itself.

Prydion stared with disbelief at his wife and their tiny newborn children. In the span of a few moments, he had gotten everything he could have desired and more. He was a father twice over. And the hope of his family had indeed come into being a reality. For all that he had desired a son, his eyes kept moving toward his daughter. She seemed to be the balance that he needed as well. And maybe, she was the balance that his family had overlooked all these long years.

""I should be taking me leave I think."" Calaria whispered softly, grinning at the new family. ""I owe you so much thanks, Calaria."" Alishe whispered back as she cradled her children. Calaria nodded and grinned from ear to ear. ""I should be going too. I'm sure I'll see more of them tomorrow."" Aurora grinned at her sister, still in shock that she was an aunt twice over.

""Now, it's done."" Alistair said to Isewyn, who didn't seem to so sure. ""We should probably get going ourselves. Nothing more to do here."" Isewyn glanced at the house and then nodded slowly. Both of them pausing to stare once more at the fire which now blazed brightly.

The others had not been gone long before Alishe and Prydion were joined by Homrend, who was very excited to hear the news that Alishe had finally given birth. He grinned at them both and congratulated them repeatedly, settling down the bucket of water he had brought with him. The men grinned at one another while Alishe stared at the bucket.

""Homrend... What is the water for?"" She had asked the question three times before he finally answered. ""Ach, it's a dwarven custom lass. I meant tae toss it on Prydion."" Alishe blinked. ""But you already threw water on him once! Don't you remember. The day I told Dor'ano we were expecting!"" Homrend chuckled and shook his head. ""Nae fears lass. I won't be doing it today."" He grinned as she looked back and forth between the babies. ""So, the question on everyone's mind!"" Alishe and Prydion eyed Homrend and Alishe tilted her head, waiting to hear what it was. ""What do their ears look like?!""

Alishe smirked a little and then laughed softly. She hadn't even had a chance to really look. ""Well.."" Alishe said as she slowly brushed back the blanket that covered her daughter's head. ""She has her father's hair."" Prydion grinned then. ""And her mother's looks!"" He quickly chimed in. Homrend peered at her, trying to get a closer look at her ears when Prydion's hand brushed against the soft curls of the newborn's hair. His fingers edging past the slightly pointed delicate ears. Homrend nodded. ""Hmmm.""

Alishe smiled and snuggled her daughter close. Prydion had taken up their son in his arms and was showing him off to Homrend when Corise arrived. ""Hello and congratulations to you both!"" Everyone greeted her and the new parents thanked her for the well wishes. Her visit wasn't very long. She remained long enough to fawn over the babies and couldn't help but feel a slight pang of longing as she gazed at the sweet face of the sleeping newborn she actually got to hold in her arms.

""We should be goin."" Homrend said suddenly and Corise nodded in agreement. More congratulations were said and then suddenly the new parents found themselves alone.

Alishe fumbled with their son as she tried to figure out how to nurse him properly. He seemed content for a few moments, then fussed. Only to go back to nursing again soon after. Prydion cradled their daughter in his arms who began to fuss and wail, obviously wanting a turn at something to eat herself. Soon, Alishe was asking to trade with him. ""You'll have to burp him Dor'ano."" She whispered as she settled back with their daughter, watching with a proud smile as Prydion settled his son against his shoulder and patted him gently.

""They need names, love."" Prydion nodded slowly. ""Aye, that they do."" He lifted his son up and gazed into his face. ""What is ye name my boy?"" Alishe pondered herself as she watched them. Moments passed with neither saying a word, lost in their own thoughts as to what to call this beautiful boy. Then, they both spoke at once.

""Rowan."" Alishe said.

""Prydrowan"" Prydion spoke at the same time.

Alishe laughed. ""Did we just come up with practically the same name at the same time?"" After all, they hadn't even discussed a single name since she became pregnant. The argument that Prydion was convinced it would be a boy had nipped that in the bud. Prydion grinned back to his wife. ""Aye. It's as if we just knew what his name should be."" He then kissed his son's head and smiled. ""Aye. Prydrowan is ye name.""

Alishe bit her lip and glanced away. ""Rowan. I want to call him Rowan."" Prydion's eyes snapped back to her and he frowned. ""He needs to have his own name Dor'ano. I mean no offense. But he should have his own name."" The frown deepened. ""He has his own name! A grand name that is attached to his family. As it should be!"" Alishe bit her lip harder and sighed. This argument could go on for hours she realized.

""I want to call him Rowan."" She hesitantly glanced at him and spoke before he could interrupt her further. ""His name.. in stone.."" Alishe spoke of the ritual that Homrend had mentioned to them before he left. ""Can be Prydrowan, but only if you allow me to call him Rowan."" She stared at Prydion and held her breath waiting for his response.

A very slow nod was her first answer. ""Aye, love. Alright."" Alishe released the breath she had been holding and smiled once more. Her son had a name. ""Now it is her turn. She needs a name too."" Alishe stared down at their daughter and pondered. ""Dor'ano?"" Prydion watched her thoughtfully. ""hmmm?"" He responded as he kissed his son once more. ""What was your mother's name? I cannot recall.""

Prydion came to sit down on the corner of the bed, a hand resting upon Alishe's leg. ""It was Kareen."" He whispered with a gentle smile. ""Shall we call her that Ishura? Kareen?"" Alishe bit her lip and glanced at her newborn a moment before countering. ""Kareelin..."" He pondered over it and tried to pronounce it out a few times. ""Kah REE lin, aye?"" Alishe nodded and smiled softly. ""What do you think?

""I like it! It fits her well."" Contentment and happiness filled with Alishe. They were named. Her children were named. Her family was together and her life was rich. Prydion reached out and brushed a slight damp curl away from Alishe's face, smiling at her.

""Life with you, my Dor'ano.. has never been entirely smooth."" She paused and grinned. ""But I would not yield it for anything. ""We live in interesting times, don't we?"" He whispered to her as he gave her a look of utter adoration. ""Aye."" She whispered back. ""And, ye have an unusual and interesting husband."" Alishe could only grin at that.

""Who is rather handsome."" He continued on. ""And modest!"" She retorted. ""And quite funny."" Prydion grinned. ""Occasionally charming."" Alishe snickered softly. ""Fiery in battle. Dashing and daring."" Prydion's grin just kept growing broader with every comment he made.

""Stubborn."" Alishe laughed outright. ""Witty and well-spoken."" He countered her. She shook her head and grinned once more. ""Who loves me better than I would have thought anyone could."" Prydion smiled and whispered. ""All things considered, ye could have done better but..."" ""Who challenges me to be a better woman and keeps me on my toes."" Alishe interrupted him. ""Not true Dor'ano. Not true."" Prydion laughed. ""Paws. I keep ye on ye paws."" She poked him playfully.

""You are my match. The sun in my sky."" They looked deeply into one another's eyes and both of them seemed to sigh happily at the same time. Prydion winked at her. ""Occasionally the pain in ye bum."" Alishe snickered softly. ""As I am in yours."" Prydion nodded affirmation and they both laughed.

""What about your wife, hmm? Let's hear you gush about her a bit."" Alishe giggled and tilted her head at him. ""I do always!"" He pretend to protest and then nodded slowly, chuckling to himself as Alishe whispered, ""Gush more!"".

""Me wife?"" His eyebrows raised up as he continued to grin at her. Alishe nodded in response awaiting to hear what he had to say. ""Ah.. the stunningly beautiful, clever and caring woman called, 'Alishe'."" He leaned over and kissed her cheek, whispering in her ear as he lingered there. ""Her face, the brightest star in my sky. Her lips, like a rare and precious win. Her arms, they are my home."" He leaned back and smiled at Alishe. ""The woman I know in my heart loves me more than any other. And will love no other like she does me."" His eyes twinkled with mischief. ""The only woman I would ever agree to marry, without the tip of a sword at my throat."" Alishe raised her eyebrows and then laughed. ""And now... mother to me children. Most importantly..."" She smiled at him and sighed contently. ""The heart that walks oustide me body. I will cherish like nothing else I could ever have or want.""

Prydion's hand came to rest upon Alishe's and he looked into her eyes. ""Please, be with me always. And if ye cannot stand to be near me sometime? Walk away, but come back..."" She bit her lip as he continued. ""And be mine."" Alishe's eyes filled with tears. ""I am yours Dor'ano. Every day of my life. We walk together."" He smiled softly at her as he whispered. ""O fulo osa.""

""O fulo osa, su alah'ni."" She whispered back. ""You complete me Ishura. In a way that no one can imagine until tis theirs."" His hand gripped hers tighter. ""I give meself as a gift to ye, and I ask only that you adore me always."" Alishe licked her parched lips and smiled once more. ""I take your gift and treasure it as I do your love. And.. most importantly..."" She looked deep into her husband's eyes. ""I give you.. my trust."" This was huge to Alishe to finally say considering some of what they had endured before the twins were born. He recognized it and squeezed her hand again. ""I will see ye I am worthy of that. And more. With each passing day, more and more me love."" Prydion released Alishe's hand and lifted himself leaned over to take the cup of water from the table by the bed, offering it to Alishe.

""Drink and then rest yeself."" Alishe sipped at the water and then lifted her hand to brush against Prydion's cheek, leaving it to linger there for a brief bit. Her eyes glistened over with tears. ""O fulo osa. Truly."" He smiled back at her. ""I know, Ishura. And I love you. Always. And these two little gifts, a testament to that love."" Alishe started to feel her weariness but continued to smile. ""They are.. aren't they?"" Prydion took the cup from her hands as she settled back into her pillows. ""I'll watch over them, whilest you nap.""

Alishe closed her eyes and sighed happily, quickly drifting off into slumber. Prydion brushed his hand against her cheek and lifted their daughter from her eyes, carrying both babies over to the cradle in the corner. ""Rest ye well. All of ye."" He whispered to all the sleepers in the room as he settled into a chair, watching them silently."

"event","Footsteps echoed as Alishe walked slowly through the empty cavern. In the dim light, her fingertips brushed along the rocky walls which were slighty damp with moisture. She had no idea where she was going... No, that wasn't true. She knew this path very well. She just didn't know why she was here again.

She hadn't been here since...

Before they slew the dragon. This was his domain. His hiding place. What in Elune's name was she doing here?

Her mind whirled as she continued to walk. Coming to the large open space in which pure thick darkness lay ahead. Her ragged breath echoed lightly as she shivered, wrapping her arms around herself.

""Fear doesn't suit you little one. You are not fearful. Step into the darkness, for it is the only way to see the light.""

Alishe blinked even though her eyes didn't see a thing. She knew that voice. Oh, how she knew that voice. But... but.. he was dead. They had slain him. And with his death, the end of her corruption.. and the end of her child's brief existence in this world.

Fear started to become replaced with anger. It all began to bubble to the surface again. Everything she never dealt with, everything she never overcame. It flooded her senses. And as it did, the area around her became darker, almost as if a thick fog was moving in.

""Anger. Hatred. These things don't become you either. Where is the truth inside of you? Where is the druid who found peace in the midst of war?""

Alishe clenched her fist, feeling her own heartbeat speed up as she continued to fill with fury about all that the one who spoke to her now had cost her. All for saving his life as a child. Even as what limited sight Alishe had faded into nothingness, her mind continued to churn and focus upon her pain.

""You. Are. Dead."" Alishe whispered through a clenched jaw. ""You. Are. Dead."" She repeated again, more for her own benefit than for anyone else.

""Things are not always as simple as they seem. And betrayal isn't always a vicious act of will, little one. Look beyond what you see.""

""I can't see a bloody thing you deranged figment of my imagination!"" Alishe shouted and her voice bounced off the cavern walls, almost hurting her ears with the intensity. The laughter that followed caused Alishe to snarl, her feral nature almost springing to the surface before she could stop it.

""When you are finished growling and getting ready to pounce at shadows, let me know. I'm here for a reason, little one. I have things to discuss with you. Important matters.""

Alishe scoffed. ""Nothing you have to say is important enough for me to listen to. You tormented me while you were alive. Took my life several times. Took control over me. Your corruption.. cost me the life of one of the most precious things in this world! And now you show up.. I'm here again, almost as if it never happened and you ask me to listen to you?"" Alishe turned, though she wasn't sure if she was heading the right way, the air was so thick and dark, she felt horribly disoriented. ""No, I will not endure this anymore. I will not listen. I will either leave or wake myself, but either way.. I will not""

""ISHURA!!!!"" The voice boomed, causing the cavern to quake and Alishe to lose her balance.. falling hard upon the rocks under her. Pain seared through her knee where it made contact with a sharp edge. She closed her eyes, trying to catch her breath.

""I once warned you that a storm was coming. And you barely managed to escape it's wraith. But this time, you may not be so lucky. Fear has pushed you to do a foolish thing, little one. Very foolish indeed."" The dragon's breath filled the air for a moment.. a burst of flame and smoke.

The cavern filled with light and the dragon turned his head toward her, his eyes staring into hers. ""And while you stand here hating me..."" He turned his giant head away and for a brief second, Alishe could have sworn she saw immense sadness in his eyes. ""Your spirit is lost.""

""WHAT?"" Alishe blinked several times in disbelief. ""You lie. You are full of lies. I don't know what trick this is, but it ends now."" She turned and began to walk back down the way she came.

""There is no going back, little one. Not right now."" The dragon paused for a moment. ""You are lost. And unless you can find your strength, find the answers you seek so you can release yourself from this prison you've made..."" Alishe swallowed hard as something in her felt the truth in his words, even if it didn't make any sense to her mind. ""You. Will. Never. Go. Back.""

Alishe turned slowly around, her eyes coming to meet the dragon's stare. He let out another breath, which filled the cavern with a brief flicker of intense light and smoke. ""Tell me that I lie, little one. Go on."" His eyes turned from hers. ""Yell and get it out of your system. Curse me and scream till your voice cracks, but it will do you no good. You know what you risked by doing this and yet you still choose to go on with it."" Alishe held her breath as the words echoed through the chamber and through her mind. ""The question is, what will you do now?""

She took tenative steps toward the dragon with a catch in her throat. It felt hard to breathe... but then Alishe suddenly reminded herself that she wasn't breathing anymore. It wasn't real. She was not really here. She was trapped in the dream.

Trapped... with the tormentor of her soul.

""Elune, you have a sick sense of humor."" Alishe thought to herself and the dragon chuckled as if she had said it outloud. Her eyes narrowed at the dragon and for a moment, she toyed with the idea of attacking him. After all, what would he do, kill her? The amused look upon the dragon's face faded away and he stared coldly at her.

""The child in you is disappointed with the woman that you've become, little one."" Alishe growled. ""And when you are faced with that knowledge, it will bring you back to reality."" The dragon nodded to himself and turned himself around, placing his back to Alishe. ""Until then, stew in your darkness, for it's what you crave the most right now."" The dragon smirked. ""I pity those who love you Alishe. They call for you to come back. He calls for you to return to him. Yet you would rather fight me, then fight for your life."" The dragon's eyes moved down to rest upon her very swollen stomach. ""And the life of the unborn.""

Suddenly something fell to the ground with a metallic ping. Alishe looked down and saw Prydion's wedding ring lying there and she blinked in disbelief. Slowly she knelt down and her hand shook as she reached out. She had gone and done this, despite his pleading with her not to. If he knew that she was trapped now, how would he feel? The last thing he needed was more hardship. And yet, here it was. Brought about by Alishe's rash and hasty actions.

She squeezed the ring so tightly in her hand that she swore it started to cut into her skin. She wouldn't let him go. Somehow, she would get back to him.

Somehow...

The dark mist began to surround her again. ""I leave you to your thoughts, little one."" The dragon spoke as everything faded from view, save the ring in her hand, which she stared at with intensity. ""Until such time as you are ready to hear all I have to say.. have the wisdom to listen and find the answers you crave and have the will to fight for what matters most.""

The last thing Alishe saw.. was Prydion's wedding band.

And as the darkness closed in, a single word filled the cavern.

""Dor'ano!"""

"event","""It can't be real. I have to be dreaming. Yet I'm awake!"" There she stood. The place that for three nights now, she had come to see. Following some man who was familiar and yet, was not. A man with hair like her beloved Dor'ano. The dream had been so vivid on the third night that Alishe threw the covers off and immediately grabbed her armor. She had to see for herself if the dream was telling her something.

She urged Banthalos on as quickly as the tiger would take her. Following the path in her mind. Only this time, she had no guide urging her onward. The man in her dreams was not running before them. He was not glancing back to see if she still followed. Yet she still knew exactly where shew as going. The landscape simply flew by and before she knew it, she stood on the banks of the tiny island. Staring in disbelief.

""Oh bloody hell..."" 

Alishe reached out to touch the stone of the grave in front of her. A chill hit her spine and she bit her lip, trying desperately to shake off the dread she felt rising up within her. Ice cold. It hit her like tiny needles and she quickly jumped backward.

She blinked several times, trying to comprehend what she was seeing. She watched as a young woman ran past her, rushing toward the edge of a cliff. Her face, so familiar. The woman was obviously in pain and crying, but the cause was nothing Alishe could understand. She tried to yell or move, but could not. Instead, Alishe remained trapped in this vision, watching helplessly as the woman fell to her death.

And just as quickly, Alishe felt herself come back to where she was, her head roaring with pain. It took a few moments before she could see clearly again and she rubbed at her temple as she glanced around. ""What the bloody hell was that."" Her brow furrowed as she thought about what she just saw. Her stomach began to sink as she realized why she knew the face. ""Tah.."" Before she could finish her thought, the last bit of sunlight hit the edge of the second gravestone not far away and Alishe's eyes followed the glimmer.

""Oh Elune. It's real."" Alishe's buzzbox fell to the ground, crackling and squealing loudly. 

Alishe couldn't hear a thing. Her eyes locked upon the stone as she moved over to examined it closer. Her heart was beating so hard that it was difficult to breathe. Though part of it was missing, the first four letters were those etched into her mind and heart forever.

Pryd.

With all her might, she ran. Ran faster than she ever had before. The sound of her heart beating like thunder in her ears. The look on his face etched into her mind.

Answers, there were no answers. Only more questions.

The familiar sight of Moonglade whirled past her as she moved onward. It wasn't until she reached the entrance to the barrow that she began to fret. ""What.. am.. I doing? Oh bloody hell. Be sure of this Alishe. Be sure of it like you have nothing else.""

Her footfalls echoed as she walked, her eyes slightly blurred by the tears she refused to let fall. For them both, she had to have answers. Answers he could not get. Answers that she could not see awake.

Only by dreaming... could she understand.

""Ishura. No, I demand you stop. Do not do this!"" Prydion's voice filled her buzzbox as he bellowed and pleaded with her at the same time. His voice grew softer and she could feel his fear coming through each word he spoke. ""Ishura. I cannot lose you. Or the baby. Please. Stay with me.""

""I cannot stand by you and endure this without answers Dor'ano."" The fear was too much to bear. And the more she learned, the more fear she had. Two graves stood on the island of her dreams. One carrying the beginning of her husband's name. The other, unmarked but carrying with it the for-telling of a woman's death.

Dor'ano was connected to this. As was this other woman she barely knew. And Alishe had no answers. No understanding. Only fear.

The only thing she knew was the dreaming. And it beckoned her to it like a moth to a flame.

""Elune help me. Elune protect me. Elune protect us.""

Slowly, she began the old chanting she had learned long ago. Words only uttered by those who wish to dream. And dream.. she would.

""Yours. Always yours."" Alishe whispered to Prydion in her mind, as she drifted away."

"event","<i>The little one woke me from my sleep yet again. These late night beatings that she seemingly must give  my insides is enough to drive me mad! I try to sing a little, hoping the the vibration of my voice would soothe her into resting with me, but oh no. She will not have it. Whenever I lay down, tis time for her to kick and squirm like never before!

Rest. I'm starting to wonder what it is.

And yet, I've been told.. by those who have parented before me, that this is all part of readying yourself for the sleep you will not get once the baby is born. And I have to ask myself..

Am I really ready for this?

Elune, I hope so. No, I know I am. It is Dor'ano that I hope is truly ready. He says he is, but as of late he's been acting so bloody strangely that I don't know.. what to think. 

Only a few days ago, the man I love nearly broke my heart and for a brief moment in time, I considered a life without him in it. I don't know what overcame me. Save for fear. Fear is a powerful enemy. And sometimes I wonder if it is not more powerful than any of the wretched beings that we fight against so often.

But I must not let fear win. I will not let fear win. 

There she goes again. Bloody hell, I wonder if this child will ever rest when she comes into this world?

I sit and watch Dor'ano sleep. He looks so peaceful now, but something keeps causing me to stare at him. Almost as if I'm searching for something in his face. In his eyes. But for what I cannot say. 

Mayhaps it's just a sense of security in a time when nothing seems truly secure. I feel more awkward and fragile now than ever I did before. And I hate admitting that and I will not do so to Dor'ano. Or anyone else for that matter. I am slowly watching my feet disappear from view, blocked by this large belly I continue to grow at an ever increasing rate.

Dor'ano is right. I fret too much.

No.... It is as I told him. 

I fret... exactly.. as much as I should."

<i>So life moves at a bit slower pace than it used to, but the call and need for those willing to fight for what matters most is stronger now than ever before. I had told myself that my focus needed to be upon protecting the growing life within my womb, but as I see the world around me change and twist, I realize that if I do not continue to heal and fight against the true evils in this world, there won't be much of a life to give our family.

It is a risk. And I'm well aware of just what it is that I'm putting in danger. But it must be done. And somehow, deep down.. I feel more content knowing that I am not sitting by and allowing everyone else to fight alone.

For weeks, I dreamt about Zul'Gurub. At first, I thought mayhaps that I was just focusing so much on that place because of my deep seeded fear that Dor'ano's cooking would turn me into one of those big nasty bloody trolls that I cannot stand looking at. But the dreams persisted. I would wander around that place, searching. For what, I couldn't decide. I even thought that maybe I was just searching for those that I care for. Dor'ano who has traveled there often without me and I even wondered if it was he that I was seeking. But the search seemed... different somehow.

The jungle consumed my thoughts and not even my garden would give me distraction as it once did.

I slowly pulled out my armor and looked it over, my fingers brushing along my dagger which gleamed in the sunlight. Dor'ano watched me silently and I could see the worry and concern in his eyes. However, deep down he knows that this is what must be done. We are both warriors. And naught will change that. Not even the family we both long for. We must keep the fires burning and we must face the challenges life places in our way.

The next time our friends adventured into that forsaken troll domain, I was with them. My stomach a flutter with nerves and my mind whirling with fret and worry. Was I doing the right thing? Would I end up drowning in regret? How could I take such a risk?

But the further we traveled, the more I knew that I was doing the right thing. I felt it with every fiber of my being. 

I was where I belonged. 

And the silent search continued. I was awake, but I was still looking for some elusive thing which I could not place a name upon. And it was haunting me. Weeks went by and I continued to  enter and leave the jungle wondering just what was behind this driving need to be there.

Then last week, the dream came again. Only this time, it was more vivid than any before it. I stood before a group of tigers, who were snarling and growling at me. But none approached. They narrowed their feline eyes and paced almost as if they were bound in some cage I could not see. I should have been horribly frightened and yet I was not. These cats were beautiful and I have always had much respect for them and their power. They are not all that unlike the sabers that my people have learned to ride and hunt with. However, on a very base level, these cats hold more ferocious energy and power than I have ever seen in any saber I've ever encountered. Even my own precious Emaulde, who was the very first saber I ever rode.

I glanced around and saw a tiger wandering down a path. He turned his head to me and I saw no hostility there. It shocked me a little. With a twist of his long stripped tail, he broke his contact with me and walked forward, almost beckoning me to follow. All the while, the cats that were threatening me from not so far away, continued their dance of warning.

""Talah"" I called. My beautiful stallion did not respond. He never resisted my call and was always there when I needed him. I couldn't help but frown. Where was he?

And the tiger walked on. 

I could hear him purring in my mind.

Silently I began to move, my feet taking me down this path after a tiger who could easily tear my heart out if he wanted. And yet, I was not afraid. He paused before me and I quickly caught up to him. I bit my lip and held my breath as I approached. I knew I was doing something exceedingly dangerous. And that is when he turned. Not as quickly as I've seen the tigers change course when they are about to strike, no.. this was different. Instead of taking me by surprise and going in for the kill, the tiger... laid down on the ground before me. A roaring purr filling my mind.

That's when I woke up.

It was time again to travel to the jungle. I kept pondering my dream. What could it have meant? I had this weird feeling deep within me and it almost kept me from going, but I knew something would happen there that night. Something that would change me.

We fought hard that night. Overcoming whatever challenges the trolls tried to place before us. Overcoming the very jungle itself, which seemed to be at the beck and call of Hakkar. And when we approached a group of tigers, I felt myself catch my breath. We would fight the priest of these beasts. What the trolls referred to as their ""loa"". A demigod of sorts who represented all that these beasts were about. And we were to slay him.

My throat was dry and I was sweating horribly. Why was I so nervous? I kept telling myself to get a grip, but something was continuing to nag at me.

The battle was fierce. One of the most intense I have witness in that place. But together, we worked as one. And like a storm, our energy could not be stopped. And the tiger loa fell to the ground with a giant thud. But before he did.. I hear his voice in my mind.

""You have earned a protector, Alishe Na'shaile. Prove your worth that you deserve such a reward.""

I looked around, but realized quickly that the voice had not come from any of my companions. I stared blankly at the corpse laying before me. Trying to decipher exactly what to think of this final message. 

Then I heard the gasps.

A giant tiger came forth from the shadows and walked toward us. A few prepared for battle, but most just stared in disbelief. He was beautiful. He was amazingly strong. And he was.. heading straight for me! And there, I stood.. unable to move. Almost unable to breathe. His strides brought him across the distance between us in no time flat. I saw Dor'ano move to stand before me, but I raised my hand to him. 

""No Dor'ano. It is alright. O fulo osa."" It was about all I could manage at that moment. 

The world stood still as the amazing beast stood in front of me. His eyes locked upon mine and I could actually feel his breath upon my face. With one motion, I would be gone. That's all it would take for him to finish me. Yet, he did not attack. Instead, he made a motion... which shocked us all.

The giant head lowered in a gesture of submission. This beast was offering himself to me. I blinked a few times trying to decide if mayhaps I was dreaming again and didn't realize it. His head remained exactly where it was and almost involuntarily, my hand reached toward him. I am pretty sure that everyone was holding their breath as I was right then. Scared for me, uncertain what would happen next and anxious to understand exactly what was happening.

Soft fur brushed against my fingertips and the tiger made no motion, save for a deep rumble which came forth, indicating pleasure. He was purring. Loudly.

And that was.. that. I had been chosen by this magnificent animal to be borne upon his back. And the honor of that still awes me deeply.

My Talah has been missing since the tiger appeared and as much as I miss him, I have to wonder if mayhaps it was for a reason. Maybe somehow Talah knew that I was meant to be with my.. protector and didn't want me to feel guilt in that. Just as Emaulde was content to roam Ashenvale without me when Talah came along. I do believe that we shall see each other again. When the time is right. I hope anyway.

Dor'ano and I discussed what I would call my new companion. And I went through many words in Darnassian which I felt might fit him. In the end, the word for protector seemed to be what fit the best. And when I first called him ""Banthalos"", it seemed like his eyes lit up in a way I had never seen. And the purr that he emitted was so loud that I almost thought people for miles would be able to hear it.

Elune has blessed me greatly. And I feel more strongly than ever, that Banthalos is a sign that I am doing what I should be. Continuing to fight as best I am able, for as long as I am able."

"event","<i>A few days from now will be my anniversary. The day that changed my life forever. A simple walk to the park which resulted in Dor'ano and I becoming husband and wife. A secret that we tried to keep for almost two months. And it would take me another almost two weeks to get a proposal and ring out of the man I called  ""su alah'ni"".

A man who has made me incredibly happy. Who has challenged me to be a better woman and who has frustrated me beyond what all I could possibly write here. Yet, I adore him beyond all others. And that shall never change.

My life has changed much in this past year and I find myself so drawn to the quiet comfort of our house here in Ashenvale. My fingers are forever covered in dirt from the garden that I tend as often as Dor'ano allows. I've found that many things refuse to grow in the soil here, but it doesn't stop me from trying. I am determined and stubborn like that.

No longer does my path seem to lead me to the restless travels that I once thought would never end. Instead,  I wake up with only sore muscles that I earned from toiling the earth and a house filled with the scent of incredible food which my love seems to never tire of making. I'm surprise I'm not the size of one of those nasty trolls in Zul'Gurub with the way he feeds me!

As difficult as it has been to not travel with those I call friend, I welcome them when they come to visit us and I cannot help but feel content in the path I have choosen here. Even though it comes with regret of not caring for all those that I once did. Instead, I must trust their care to others.

Even my precious Dor'ano. When he must travel when I cannot.

For I know now that I carry something precious which must be guarded and protected beyond all else. And while I do not crave the sweet rolls I did before, it is obvious.. to me at least, that a long held wish has been granted.

Dor'ano does not know yet and I keep thinking that my hand upon my belly and my knowing smiles will tell the tale to him without me saying a word, but not as of yet. I think he is still convinced that I complain of my tightened robes because of his cooking.

Soon, I'll share the news. I just fear letting him down.. if Elune forbid something should happen. No, I must not think of such things. Though I cannot help but fear. And fear I have plenty of.

Another letter arrived the other day from Meep. Telling us tales of her travels and explorations. How strong she's grown since the little girl I met in Ironforge! I almost wish we still lived in the house that we shared with her there. So that I could go and place my hand against that scroched wall.. just to feel her close. I miss her beyond what I can say but am happy in knowledge that she is with her mother and that they are seeing so much with one another.

I cannot wait until I can share such news with her as well. I hope she will be excited.

The old ways still hold fast to me and I find it difficult to fight back the desire to go and fight just one more battle. Though, I feel that for now, my path must keep me here. I must protect what I've started here. That is the most important battle I can fight.

And hopefully when the time is right... When Dor'ano and I have seen the fruit of this labor brought forth safely, then I can venture forth once again.

I hope. I truly do.

Elune guide my path and keep my family safe. Keep the family of friends whom I treasure much safe as well. And never let any of them doubt how much they mean to me. 

That would be my prayer.

((*takes a deep breath* 

After a lot of long hard thinking, I have decided that Alishe will be going into a retirement of sorts. She is not gone and I may very well pop in from time to time, but for the most part, she will be enjoying her life in Ashenvale and being quiet.

This has not been an easy decision for me. 

I love the character that I've helped to create. I treasure the people who have helped to influence who she is and who have impacted her life and mine. The path might be parting, but I take you with me. 

And I will come home again.

*grateful hugs to everyone*

"event","<i>I can feel their webs upon my skin still. I've taken three baths and still the sensation remains. It makes me shudder and feel ill to think about.

Slowly encasing me and covering my mouth, causing me to struggle for breath. The fear that I would never see the light of day again. Until finally I fought my way free, only to be covered by the webs yet again.

I hate spiders. No, really. When I am forthright honest about it, I hate them. I have always struggled with a discomfort for the beasts, even when they caused me no threat. Something about their way of walking, their multiple eyes. I.. don't.. know. I just. Ick.

When I started my training, I had to endure traveling through a cave filled with spiders. I cannot begin to express what a difficult thing this was for me. To go into their territory and have to try to retrieve an egg of their spawn. 

I almost refused.

But a sense of duty made me go forward. And since then, I have faced many a spider in combat. But never like this. Never did they wrap me up and cause me such horror.

I almost screamed once. My mind couldn't handle what was happening to me. I just wanted it to stop. I wanted to collapse to my knees and not move. I wanted to close my eyes and wish it all away.

But again, duty kept me going. I had a duty to my companions to keep them alive in the midst of heated battle. And despite the inward screaming of my soul at enduring such horrific things, I kept going. Because it's my duty as a healer to do so. To give of myself. To push myself beyond my own boundaries and do whatever it takes.

Even if it means I must be encased in a spider web with venom flowing through my veins.

I was very restless last night and Dor'ano tried his best to comfort me and soothe my anxious mind. I know he did not rest very well himself fretting after me. Just when I managed to finally release my memories enough to fall asleep, I had the most awful nightmare which made me awake with a start.

We will go back there again I fear. 

And I will have to find my strength to handle that. 

To handle whatever may come."

"event","<i>Never thought a mug of ale could change my life..

But it has. 

And by accepting it, I have changed my path and joined it with others. I feel so many emotions at this moment. Some good. Some not so.. good.

I fought with my Dor'ano tonight. It was quite nasty I might add. Downright hurtful. I can only hope that once he realizes what I've done tonight, he will not go against what he said when our fight was finished. That he will find a way to support me as he said he would. Even if he does not agree.

He still believes.. truly believes.. in the corruption of the ideal of a guild and showed no restraint in telling me this yet again. 

He fears I will be hurt.

Our fight was ended when I brought up the conversation I had with Aurora when I told her I wanted to marry Dor'ano. She questioned how I could be happy with the idea of a potential short life with my husband and the eventual heartbreak that would come from losing him.

I would rather follow my happiness and treasure it while I can then to not have it at all.

And this feels right for me. Right now. In this place. My feet have led me here.

As much as I fear the upset of my sisters, I can only pray that deep down, their love for me and desire to see me happy will be their guiding force. And that they will find a way to accept my decision to be a part of this family just as I will always be a part of theirs. They are my sisters, always and forever and I treasure them dearly. More than either of them will ever know in fact.

That is the weight that pulls this happiness downward.

But the deed is done. I have taken the mug and I've drank from it.

Ceil suggested that I wear naught but my tabard when I tell Dor'ano the news. Sad to say, I'm actually considering that notion. I can only imagine his reaction. 

What a mixture it would be.

Aye. Indeed."

"event","<i>The wind blows softly against my cheek as I sit down to write in this long neglected journal of mine. I stared at the paper for a while, and held this pen in my hand, almost as if I forgot how to use it. So long has it been since I placed my innermost thoughts here. So long has it been since I've shared my life. So much has happened and yet it's all been locked away inside my mind.

The one certainty in this life is that change is ever present. Again, as in the life of the plants that I love and treasure so much. The seed grows and blossoms. When the time is right, it is plucked from the soil and used. 

That is the constant. That life will go on. That change will happen. 

I have been changed by what has happened in my life. In some ways... twisted into darkness and in other ways, lifted into the light. 

I have lost. I have loved. I have learned, changed and grown from the girl I used to be. I am no longer naive about many things I used to be. And deep down, despite all the disappointment and heartache, I can see my hope. It is very distant from me, but calls out when I am able to listen. Someday, it will be with me again.

I believe that. I do.

When I find myself restless at night, I often take walks. Sometimes just around the harbor, where I find a quiet spot to watch the ocean waves ebb and flow. Taking my thoughts and cares away with them as I ponder to myself. I miss the arms of my precious Dor'ano, but I fear my restlessness would wake him. And I would rather my love slept deeply then to disturb his slumber even a little.

In the desire to find my own path, I have made very difficult decisions. Some of which have hurt those whom I love. Namely my sisters. Thankfully Aurora and I have found one another again and are finding solace in our caring for one another, despite the distance we have between us. Which is ironic considering how distant she used to be. But my twin. The one with whom I shared a womb, does not seem to be desiring my thoughts or caring at all. She harbors anger and lashes out in little ways which cut me to the bone. I should confront her, but I never do. For I feel I deserve the hurt she gives me. Even though deep down, that's not entirely true.

I tried to followed the path which was right for me. Admittedly, I got lost in the heat of battle and the desire to save as many souls as I could. Those which I have called friends and who have been my almost constant companions for all these long months now have been my focus and with them, I have seen many amazing things accomplished. I cannot regret this. I cannot feel ashamed, nor will I.

Tonight, I found myself in Stormwind, far from home and the bed of my beloved. I know not what drew there, only that I followed some whim. An instinct that took hold of me and my feet. I wandered the streets, listening to conversations and watching those who wandered past. And I wondered... would any of us truly be  content? If all war were to stop and peace took hold, would we be content in it? Or has war and fighting taken hold of us so deeply that we do not know how to live without it's ever constant presence in our lives?

I have always considered myself a healer. But tonight I wondered.. for I have done this for so long now. Sought battles and fought foes and.. healed the scars of battle.. what would I do if not this? Who would I be if not the druid that I am?

My ponderings led me straight down a road where I came across Ceil. Someone I have not seen in quite a while. Our last conversation was tense and much has passed since then. I have heard many things about Ceil and about Uthas. 

Uthas....

No, I mustn't think about him again. It does me no good. I hear so much darkness and hatred toward a man that I truly loved. Not as I love my Dor'ano, but as one loves a true friend. 

Anyway.. I greeted Ceil and I told her that I was glad to see her, which seemed to surprise her a little. But no matter what has been said, I don't know the truth of it for myself. I will not pass judgment. I will not condemn. I will stay true to the instincts I hold within myself. 

And I... will... follow my own path.

Lest I cease to be.. me.

Tarquin invited me inside the tavern where there were several others gathered. I felt a bit out of place but couldn't place the reason behind the feeling. Until talk started of the guild they were rebuilding from the ashes of the Greymane Exiles. A guild I had always respected, but never been a true part of, despite having been asked to join. I had my reasons for holding off. 

Mainly.. my sisters. I feared their disappointment. For deep down, they both believe that I will come back to the guild which I helped to found. But that is not home for me anymore. And I hold no ill will about that. Nor does it mean I think less of them or those who carry the banner since I've been gone. I'm proud of my time spent there, but I walk a different path now.

A path which has led me back to those with whom I sat with tonight. As each member at the table took hold of a tabard, I found myself fretting and my mind swirled. I felt as if I were out of place and ended up excusing myself from the room. 

Ceil followed me. 

To put it simply, I was asked to be a part of their family. And while my heart jumped at the offer and I was flattered, not to mention deeply honored.. I hesitated. 

I can hear my Dor'ano now.. going on about guild politics and whatnot. How he'd rant and rave about it. There would be no end to it if I were to walk into our home with a tabard upon my chest. There would be question from others and concern from myself over what it would all mean. Not to mention my sisters. Again, they fill my thoughts. And I fret for how they would feel if I followed this path. 

For someone who always followed her own path, I spend much time thinking about how each step affects others these days. Fretting over causing more hurt. 

And now.. here I sit, outside my mother's house, listening to night and the gentle sound of her breathing as she she sleeps. I did not tell her my burden, but she could see that something was troubling me. Yet, my mother has long since learned that I share what I wish and she never presses for more than I desire to give her. Something I treasure about her.

I cannot say what she would think of my dilemma, but I feel strongly that she would want me to follow my own spirit. Where ever it would take me.

The question is.. do I have the courage to do so?

Only time will tell.

Only time."

"event","This is all ooc.. I'm going to attempt to write about someone who touched my life not only as a friend but who portrayed characters that I truly loved.

I had the unique privilege of watching the character known as Meep grow up. She made a huge impact on Alishe and on me, from the very moment we met. A little gnome wandering around the noisy chaos of Ironforge, obviously lost. She wasn't playing a cutesy gnome as some do, this was truly a child. Every expression, every emote. It was a child coming through and the way she brought Meep to life was truly.. like breathing air into her.

Alishe couldn't ignore her. I couldn't ignore her. It took Alishe becoming a cat and purring at the small child to get her to calm enough for Alishe to speak to her. It was natural to Alishe as if a mothering instinct took hold and drove her actions.

From then on, Alishe and Meep were linked to one another. Meep would often be in Alishe's thoughts and it made her day for Meep to tell her of her travels. Meep wasn't even 10 seaons along when she and Alishe joined up to spend time with one another in Dun Morogh. Meep chittered on and on and Alishe listened with great intent. And me, I sat back in awe of the amazing rper I was watching perform.. just for me.

Alishe has a bunny named Nigel. There was a time when Alishe was rarely seen without him. He was a great confort to her and it was her thought that Meep needed a companion as well. Meep spoke about her desire for a bunny that the ranch hands raised in Amberstill and well, it wasn't long before Alishe and Meep went traveling over.. Alishe with an agenda that she did not share until she placed the box into Meep's hands.

I had no idea that a bunny could be used the way Meep used Hope. You see so many people with pets, it becomes almost.. mundane. But it wasn't to Meep. Hope was her best friend.. and in time.. became a huge part of her roleplay. And again, I watched in awe as she came up with storylines and segways that I found incredibly clever. 

She asked me what I thought about Hope being what she eventually had him become. I told her she had to go with what felt right to her. She was concerned that people would think she was god-modding and that they'd give her a hard time. I told her that I would support her. That I looked forward to seeing where she took things.

Prydion and I watched as Meep went from a timid shy child to a confident and capable young lady. She roleplayed her inability to control fire at first and explained with amazing skill how she learned to conquer it. Alishe and Prydion had a scorched wall to show for it, but that never bothered them.

Alishe and Prydion loved Meep. And she came to them at a time when they needed her most. They had just gone through the loss of their baby and their hearts were shattered. Here was a child who took a place in their lives and hearts and gave them hope. 

One of my fondest memories thinking back was a night when Alishe and Prydion tucked in Meep and Hope when it was time for bed. It was just like any typical night in a household with a young child. So not your typical roleplay, but endearing. I could just about see Meep jumping on the bed and nearly knocking Hope off with her bouncy energy. (And speaking of jumping. Remembering the first time Meep showed off her slow fall to Alishe! She gave her a heartattack! *laughs softly*)

The house in Ironforge will never be the same to me.

I want to go back there.. sit Alishe down.. and see if I can find some.. any trace of Meep there. I know she's not there.. but I can't help but wish she'd appear. Giggling and bubbly. 

I also had great opportunity of roleplaying with Reeza as well. I remember an event where she and I were trying to figure out how to rp a fight between Alishe and Reeza. It was a challenge to say the least. We knew how we wanted it to come out, but we both laughed as we weren't sure what would happen as we had never dueled before. In the end, Alishe won and actually killed Reeza. (I'm not quite sure we planned that. But we rolled with it. *hehe*)

She loved surprises and encouraged open roleplay. We rarely scripted our interaction with Meep and it was the way we all enjoyed it. She was always respectful with her storylines and tried to work around everyone's mood and availability. 

However... Meep got into trouble. 

That's an understatement. *laughs* I swear that the child's middle name was trouble. She would just follow her curiosity and end up in some horrid predicaments. It was a challenge for me to find a way to rp out the maternal bond that Alishe had to Meep along with balancing the adventures that I took Alishe on as well. 

In the end, the corruption took hold of Reeza and she left Meep in the hands of Alishe and Prydion.  Asking them to adopt Meep and care for her. This meant so much to Alishe. It was a bit mind blowing for me as a roleplayer to have someone give me that much of a part of their character's life. But she did it. And I enjoyed it. Very much.

Sometimes our interaction would be behind the scenes. And in my mind, I saw a lot of wonderful moments where Meep and Alishe would be running around the yard of their house in circles. Meep giggling as Alishe chased her in cat form. Alishe telling Meep stories about the place she grew up and the two of them sharing alchemy experiments. All the while Prydion looking on and grinning. Stopping them to share some long tale that he thought Meep should hear.

I saw a lot of family moments that no one ever got to see. 

It's sad to me that most people never got to see the side of Meep that I did. That for the most part, the memories I have of Meep's earliest days aren't shared with anyone other than Prydion. Some of the most brillant and creativie roleplaying I've ever witnessed came from Meep during that phase. And honestly, I wish more people had been able to have the opportunity to see the family that Meep had in Alishe and Prydion and likewise, the family they had in Meep. This is not to make my participation in this to be bigger than it was, but it really was rather unique and wonderful. 

When I can think clearly.. I plan to write out the last adventure that Alishe, Prydion and Meep had together. Most of it is not entirely solid in my mind, but I'll do my best to give it justice. Because it's special to me. And instead of remembering what I didn't do.. or focusing upon what I didn't say.. I'm going to keep my mind upon that day. That adventure. That time spent with her. Meep the character and my wonderful friend, whom I'm going to miss terribly.

What I'm recalling here about the character, doesn't begin to touch the surface of the friend I had. There was so much more to her. So many intricacies that I never go to know. And I can only imagine what a tremendously amazing person she had to have been through and through. Because she left her mark. And I'm never going to be the same. But I'm so thankful to have known her. I truly am."

"event","Alishe listened to the whispers with a heavy heart. 

They spoke of illness that could not be explained, which of course made Alishe's breath catch. But they were not speaking of the thing that plagued her, nor did they even seem to be aware that she was ill. Alishe relaxed a little, but the comfort did not remain as the whispers started to curse Uthas and called him all sorts of horrible things. Apparently attacks upon many were now being reported. And those Alishe cared about were all finding themselves the focus of some stranger's blade. The worst of it, the whispers claimed that Uthas was behind it all.

She took a deep breath as she caressed the twig in her hands and then bit her lip hard. Her eyes traveled over the wood as her thoughts wandered away from the whispers that never seemed to cease these days. She drifted far away. Back to the day when the great tree still stood. Intact. Whole. Alishe closed her eyes as her grip tightened on the twig which had once been a part of that great world tree. 

The bloodshed never truly ended. 

It just slowed for a bit and then took new form.

The cycle would continue on.

""Always remember your inner strength"" the note attached to the gift had read. ""Inner strength"" Alishe whispered. ""We are all going to need strength for what lies ahead."" Still, the mystery of who had sent her this precious remainder of the great tree boggled her mind greatly. 

Alishe had been at Hyjal that fateful day when the fate of the world rested upon the destruction of one of the greatest things that the Kaldorei had held dear. And it was something that she rarely, if ever, spoke about. But she often had nightmares about it. Then again, Alishe had nightmares often as of late. It seemed that the more rest she tried to get, the less she actually.. rested. Which was affecting her greatly.

Still, since she opened the box and laid hands upon the wood, she found that she felt better than she had in a very long time. It gave her a comfort and a.. strength that she could not explain. Alishe now carried it with her everywhere and would not be parted with it. ""Aye, we will need much strength indeed."" She thought to herself.

Her eyes opened and she glanced at the window across the room. ""Uthas."" Her mind had been chanting his name. She never gone to his camp to see him. She should have. She was not there at his last sermon when he fell ill with some mysterious illness. She should have been there. Guilt flooded Alishe. What kind of friend had she been to the man who had done so much for her?

So much had consumed her as of late. So much pain that she kept down deep inside of her where not even her beloved Dor'ano could see it. It had changed her once centered spirit into chaos. No longer did she seem to find balance as she once did. It changed everything, without her ever showing it. It stopped her from going to Uthas. It kept her from following her instincts which would have led her to the camp they called Absolution.

Would Alishe have found absolution there?

She sighed very deeply.

And now the whispers called her friend an abomination. Evil. A cold blooded murderer. Worse... a man who worked.. with.. Nimjhal to bring about more destruction. She shook her head and her jaw clenched. She refused to believe. She couldn't believe it. 

Not Uthas.  

""You are a naive flit, Alishe. Niave and blind obviously. The truth is all around you and yet you refuse to see it."" One of the whisperers walked away, casting back only a disgusted glance mixed with pity. Alishe blinked almost as if she was being struck.

""Uthas."" Her mind whispered and no one answered. Did she expect he would? That his pleasant and kind voice would fill her mind and that she would be given some comfort which she could not seem to find right now?

Absolution. Would there truly be absolution for anyone? And when the dust settled.. and everyone could see past the furry of of the storm. The storm which was raising the dust into the air and blinding the world... would there be absolution?

Alishe stood up slowly, the twig still firmly in her hand. As she told Prydion, it was an affirmation of the fact that something pure and untainted could remain even in the midst of great destruction. 

The twig was in a way.. absolution for a very old pain in Alishe's past. 

Yes, the cycle did continue on. But somehow, Alishe would find the strength to continue on as well. And she would find the truth of the matter. She would follow the advice that Rabine had given her. Despite the whispers all around her, she would listen to her heart and it would tell her the truth.

Slowly she made her way across the harbor. There was herb hunting to do.. and much thinking to be done. At some point, Alishe would have to pursue the trail of Uthas and find out for herself just what the truth was. Even if it was the worst, Alishe had to know."

At least to those who were there that night when we slew the headmaster at Scholomance.

I don't recall how it came out. In fact, much of it is just a whirlwind blur to me.

Only that I've hurt Yrsa. I know I have.

This thing continues to roam my body and I can feel it now. I no longer hold to the delusion that the sample that I once held for Yrsa somehow went somewhere else. 

It resides in me.

This devistates me in a way you could not possibly begin to imagine.

My desire to aid has led me astray, yet again.

I seek solice and am not finding much. As requested by Arcarius, I continue to read and researching into the demon-text book that I found in Scholomance. The more I read, the more I feel that I should not be able to do such. Mayhaps it's what blocks me from understanding. 

My own inhibitions. 

My own limitations.

My own predjudices.

Malfurion banned the use of arcane magic. I go against his wishes by diving into this, even if it does not result in my using such knowledge in any fruitful form. Such things are what drove the Quel'dorei to do all the horrible things they did. 

I feel wrong.

I feel off.

But I must keep going. I have to save Yrsa.

I meant what I said... If she falls      ......





So do I.

Please, Elune.... don't let us fall."

As she walked along, Alishe kept whispering his name to herself almost like a mantra of some kind. ""Uthas. Uthas. Uthas."" Her mind still in a whirlwind of thought and a frenzy of disbelief.

He lived.

Dor'ano knew. Why didn't she? 

Alishe glanced at her sleeping husband and bit her lip. What would he say when he found out that his old companion Uthas was back among the living? Alishe almost woke Prydion from his slumber, but decided it was best to let him sleep a little longer. They had both been scarce for rest these days and he looked so peaceful.

""Uthas."" She whispered again as she climbed into bed and snuggled up against Prydion. As Alishe closed her eyes, she remembered the night's events once more.

The way Uthas looked at her. That kind, compassionate smile of his. How warm he hugged her. He was real enough. And while he gave an explaination of sorts to the awe-struck group gathered at the Boomstick pub, questions still nagged at Alishe's mind.

And the things he said to her. She still wasn't sure what to make of it. Then again, Uthas had always been a bit of a mystery when it came to his logic. Sometimes Alishe followed it perfectly and other times, she was left boggling. But that was part of his charm. He always made her think. Challenged her to see beyond the horizon and she loved that about him.

Her friend was back. A man who aided her when she needed it most. Gave her solice and comfort at a time no one else could, save for her loving Dor'ano.

Mayhaps the whys did not matter... Mayhaps.

Alishe itched her cheek and sighed a little. Prydion stirred silently and wrapped his wife up in his arms, kissing her on her forhead. 

Somewhere deep inside of her, a voice called out, ""A storm is brewing, little one. Be on your guard."""

"event","Alishe's walls started to break down. She could no longer come up with a million excuses for why she was not resting and she knew deep down that what she needed more than anything was the support of her beloved Dor'ano. So she decided that she would tell him about the dream as well as show him the empty vial. Mayhaps he could help her figure out the mystery of what had happened to the sample that Yrsa had entrusted her with.

They walked through the forest of Elwynn, carrying lanterns and for the most part being very silent. Alishe watched her husband with a worried glance. What would he say? How would he react? She bit her lip as she walked.

The forest was beautiful at night. The soft glow of lanterns lighting the path and the sweet rays of Elune casting a soft hue over everything around them. How Alishe loved the night. Everything about it just called to her. But then again, her people were called the night elves for a reason.

To the top of the hills they climbed. They paused for a moment to look down at the view here and there and then settled upon a grassy patch where Prydion carefully started a fire for them to sit near. 

And it was there, in hushed tones that Alishe finally shared all she knew with Prydion. She could not explain the nightmare in a way that would make sense to him, but she told him all about what had happened with Yrsa. She recounted the entire terrifying scene and then bit her lip after she finished. 

He was silent. Too silent. Alishe showed him the empty vial and something in him seemed to have recognition of some kind. As if a puzzle piece was fitting into place.

He tried to be reassuring as he told her the things he had seen. The black threads that appeared and disappeared just under her skin as she itched. The strange behavior that Alishe had no recollection of. To him, it all made sense. The sample had somehow affected her.

Alishe just sat in disbelief. There was no way that thing was in her. The itching was from her robe. She had spoken to her tailor about it and was given something new to wash the robe in. It would go away. 

However... it did get worse when she was upset or stressed. Alishe tried to push the thought away. It wasn't possible. It just.. wasn't.. possible.

Prydion continued to speak reassurances to his wife, but in his eyes held a slight fear. She could see it and it made her flinch inwardly. ""Yrsa would be so upset when she learns I've lost her sample. I swore to her that I would keep it safe. I've failed her Dor'ano!"" On and on Alishe went, speaking on of how upset Yrsa would be and how she was so desperate not to lose Yrsa to this thing. 

So desperate.. that Alishe had kept her experimenting with the sample from everyone, including Prydion.

It all started to hit her. More mistakes. More failures. She could hear her father's voice in her mind, sternly chastising her. 

Her head started to swirl and then she heard his voice... her love, her husband, her lover, speaking to her as he held her hand in his. How she loved his touch. And right now, she needed it desperately.

""I love you always Ishura. Together we will get through this. You will not grow as ill as Yrsa. And we will find a way to help her as well.""

""I don't want her to die Dor'ano."" Alishe whispered as she teared up. There was not a thought for herself going through her mind. Only of Yrsa. Of the scarred skin and the pain Yrsa must be enduring. ""I don't want her to die either Ishura. We will do all we can for her. And for you."" 

In the quiet night, they held fast to one another, clinging desperately to the hope that somehow they would overcome yet another challenge that life had set in their way."

"event","Not long after Prydion awoke, there was a knock at the door. A Kaldorei stood there, his face fixed in an almost sour expression. ""Are you Prydion, husband to Alishe Na'shaile?"" The voice was cold and Prydion tried to counter it by flashing a smile and offering the messenger something to eat. ""Care for an omelet?"" The Kaldorei did not move. ""I asked you a question human. Answer now or I will leave.""

Prydion frowned and nodded his head. ""Aye. I am. But Ishura is not here right now."" Prydion looked around and blinked a few times, realizing something. ""In fact, she hasn't been here all night. Hmmm.. I wonder where me wife..."" Before Prydion could finish, the Kaldorei cleared his throat and thrust a note into Prydion's hand. ""This is for you. It is from the druidess Rendane Brightfeather. I am entrusted to give you the instruction that you are to read this alone and it is not to be shown to your wife."" And with that, the Kaldorei turned and walked down the stairs.

""Oh ho? What?"" Prydion blinked and stared at the note he held in his hands. He had no spoken to Rendane since she gave him the news about their baby being lost. To his knowledge, Alishe had not spoken to her either. And suddenly, he was being contacted by her? By the light, what was going on?

He knew something was not right with Alishe, but she kept attempting to assure him that all was well. But in his heart, he knew.. something was desperately wrong. She wasn't sleeping. She seemed more pale than usual and.. slightly distant.

He opened the letter and sat down in a chair. And in his mind, the voice of Rendane spoke.

<i>Dear Prydion,

Something dire has happened. Good intentions gone awry. Nightmares becoming reality. And your wife, the sweet spirit, is caught up in something she does not understand. I hear things, paladin. She speaks and does not know what she is saying. 

You must watch your mate carefully. Strange things will happen, but it is vital that you not frighten her worse than she is already. In fact, the more calm you help her be, the better. 

I will contact you again. In the meanwhile, you must not tell her that I have spoken to you. She still does not wish to speak to me and I fear that my involvement in this would only cause her more stress. And stress... is something we must try to avoid.

Earth Mother protect you both. Remember... Your strength lies in each other and the bond of your love. Hold fast to that, Prydion. It may just be the only thing that brings you through the trials ahead.

Rendane Brightfeather</i>

Prydion stared at the paper in disbelief."

"event","Alishe walked around Ironforge with her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She was desperately trying to comfort herself after the conversation she had earlier with Calliope and Ceil, but instead, she only felt worse with every single step she took.

She didn't like the way Calliope stared and how no matter how much Alishe tried to assure Cal that she was alright, the answer was not taken. And then Ceil... she hadn't even shown herself! And the way she spoke... Alishe was just confused and not sure what to say. Something was wrong with Ceil.

But that's not what stuck most with Alishe.

It was Ceil's harsh words to her. 

Spoken from the mind of an invisible cat who rambled about boxes and half dead cats and lies and truth and dreams.... and love. Alishe stopped and shivered, her hands rubbing her chilled arms. The forge wasn't cold, but to Alishe, it might as well have been Winterspring.

In the end, Alishe had lashed out a them both. Tired of being confronted about something she had no control over. ""Why did you tell them about the book anyway?"" Alishe asked herself in her thoughts. She sighed deeply. ""Stupid. So bloody stupid. Now they know you can read demon text. And obviously they both think less of you because of it. Feck.""

The book had been most helpful when it came to understanding the situation with Reeza and what had happened. However, the fact that Alishe could, in fact, read demon text still boggled her mind. Alishe pondered if perhaps there were answers to the enigma of what was happening with Yrsa as well. So, with that hope as her guide, Alishe studied the book further. Spending up to hours at night doing nothing but scanning over the demon text. Sometimes she would be able to make out words, but the sentences did not always make sense. And likewise, sometimes the words would seem like gibberish. And other times, she could read entire passages as if it were written in Darnassian.

It made no bloody sense.

Were they right? Was she.. dooming herself trying to save Yrsa? Alishe shook her head and refused to give the thought another moments acknowledgment. For some reason, Elune saw fit to give Alishe the ability to read the book and therefore, Alishe should use that ability to aid Yrsa... if she could be helped.

Alishe rubbed her neck and closed her eyes. Her head ached horribly for a moment. And all she could think about was her husband. The love of her life. The sun in her sky.

She hadn't seen Prydion at all that night. Alishe sighed very deeply. She could only hope that he was resting at their room in menethil. No doubt he was wondering where she was and why she hadn't come home to his arms yet. Or maybe he was growing used to her absence in their bed. 

Alishe bit her lip. She didn't want to think about that. 

And then her mind shifted.. back to the empty vial that resided in her bag. She had no clue what happened to the sample Yrsa had entrusted to her. And she did not even know what to say to Yrsa about it. Yrsa would blame herself. And that was the last thing Alishe wanted.

With another shiver, Alishe remembered what she saw as the sample was taken. 

The blackened tendrils slithering as Yrsa desperately tried to saw a piece of whatever it was that resided within her shoulder off. The sweat that formed on her brow and how, even Homrend had attempted to finish the job and was unable. With great force, the strange entity went back into Yrsa's body and the wound that Yrsa had made upon herself closed up immediately.

What Yrsa had given Alishe was all that had remained upon the blade of the knife and when it was placed into the tube, it wiggled and moved. Seeming somehow desperate to rejoin Yrsa's body once more.

Alishe had assured.. promised.. even sworn that she would not let anything happen to the sample she was entrusted with. It was Alishe's hope that she would be able to study it and use her knowledge of alchemy to help Yrsa find a cure for whatever it was that was changing and twisting Yrsa. 

""I don't want her to die. I just want to save her. I just.."" Alishe whispered to herself as tears began to fall down her cheeks. ""You bloody well did it again, Alishe. You mucked up again. Wait until she finds out. What will you say? How will you explain it being gone! You don't even know where it went! And Dor'ano? What will he say?!"" 

In a quiet corner of Ironforge, Alishe Na'shaile curled up in a ball and sobbed."

"event","In the silence of the night, a faint slithering could be heard. A rustle against the sheets that did not come from either of the occupants who rested upon the bed. It only lasted a second, but it was enough to draw Alishe's attention. 

Her eyes scanned the room, but did not see anything out of place. Dor'ano was sleeping peacefully and she tried to convince herself that she should be joining him. 

A few deep breaths. 

""It's ok, Alishe. You are fine. Rest yourself"" She tried to convince herself that all was well, but the uneasy feeling stayed fast to her. Alishe pulled the covers up a little higher and snuggled against Prydion, feeling chilled to the bone. This nightmare had been consuming her for a while now and she had told no one, not even her husband about it.

Instead, she had endured nights of no rest, which was slowly taking its toll upon her. Everyone seemed to notice something wrong and despite Alishe's constant reassurances that all was truly well, they did not seem to believe her. The inquiries were getting more persistent. Alishe had to find a way to rest. The fatigue was overwhelming.

Another deep breath.

Her eyes closed and her breath slowly began to fall into the rhythm of sleep. And just as she feared.. the dream began anew.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw it move across the floor. Lightning fast, it wriggled out of sight, yet she knew it was still there. Watching her.

Alishe would try to calm her nerves by brewing some tea. Dor'ano would be home soon and she was anxious to see him again. Ever since they had moved to the harbor, Alishe had felt some strange sense of unease. She could not put her finger on it, but it remained. It was strange how quickly and deeply Alishe had latched on to the dwarven city and how difficult it became for her to give up their first home together in favor of something new. 

Sipping her tea, she saw it move again. It was getting closer. 

In a moment, she knew that it was under the table she sat at. And with every breath she took, it was inching ever closer.

It was playing with her.

Teasing her. 

Torturing her.

Alishe held her breath as she felt something move against her leg that was very cold and slimy. Alishe tried not to scream or jump. She knew what would happen if she did and she resisted the best she could. She would not fall for this game again. She was stronger than this.. whatever it was.

And while Alishe sat there.. helpless... something coiled around her. Soon she could not feel her leg from the knee down. And the sensation was moving slowly upward.

""Don't scream, Alishe. Don't do it."" She whispered to herself in her mind.

Nausea began to fill Alishe as the whole of her leg was wrapped and then slowly melted to complete numbness. Then the process began again.... the other leg, from the foot on up.. wrapped in a tight, cold.. slime.

That's when Prydion walked in. His eyes filled with terror at what he saw before him. There was his wife, sitting at a table.. her body slowly being consumed by what could only be described as black threads. Only.. they were alive... somehow.

Alishe's eyes began to tear up as she watched her husband. If she opened her mouth, she would seal her fate. She did not want to go through this again. Oh Elune.. why was this happening!!

""Ishura! NO!""

Alishe felt it wrap around her waist. She took a shallow breath as tears fell down her cheeks. Prydion took a step toward her and suddenly he was stopped cold by something which lashed out at him, knocking him to the floor. The black thread loomed near his face.. moving back and forth for a moment as if in warning. 

Alishe couldn't take it anymore.

""DOR'ANO! RUN!!!"" She screamed. 

Before she could close her mouth, the black threads around her swirled and moved.. wrapping her up like a mummy. She felt the black thread dash into her mouth and down her throat.. choking her.

The world went black.

""NO!!!!!!!!!"" Her mind screamed.

Alishe sat up in bed, sweating.. panting. Quickly, she rose.. moving across the room and with shaking hands, she opened the backpack which sat upon the floor. Her long fingers wrapping around the vial that sat inside. She brought it out of the bag and then slumped down upon the floor.

And in the morning light, Alishe stared at the empty vial which once contained a sample of something horrid and grotesque. Something which was slowly consuming her friend Yrsa. Something... which was no longer contained as it was supposed to be.

But Alishe could not recall what happened. Only that every night, the dream would begin again."

"event","<i>Dear Diary,

So much has passed and I keep forgetting to keep track of it here. But I suppose that's the way of it when one is busy. You lose track of the little things. And that is precisely the problem. Losing track...

Since the death of Ataerno and the loss of our daughter, I have very much strayed from the ""Alishe"" that I've come to depend upon. The sense of self that I once had seems to have dissolved much like the snow around the hot springs of Winterspring.

Replacing my calm nature has been one of increasing anger and hostility. And I struggle... with... hatred.

Me. The one who fought my entire life against the plague that won my father's soul. More destructive than the plague that fed and destroyed a legion of people.. Hatred, which is the seed of all true evil... lives within my heart. And I have been helpless against it.

At first, it was a hatred of dragon and dragonkin. I blamed them for what happened with Ataerno. I found them corrupt and felt that they all needed to be destroyed. I have since slain many of their kind and gleefully so. Yet each slaying has left me feeling only more.. empty. 

None of it brings her back. She isn't come back to me..

I cannot begin to express how this pains me. And what is worse is that I have not been expressing that. To anyone. I go on with my life and I try my best to be as cheerful and pleasant as possible. All the while, this seething pain burns within my chest. Without an outlet. Without an end. Without any resolution. And the more I ignore it, the worse it grows. 

And I thought that the corruption that plagued my blood was devastating.

Then came the hatred of the one called the Butcher. Losing Uthas was a huge blow to me. Finding out that he had been slain at the hand of Nimjhal made my anger.. explode. Uthas was a friend to me. One of the truest friends I could have asked for. He is the man who married me to my Dor'ano. He was there when I needed him most and gave me incredible support and comfort at a time when I desperately needed it.

And he is gone.. mayhaps for good. People say that he still lives, but I do not know. I fear that my faith in such things is at an all time low. It is very difficult for me to have faith in much these days, when I'm being honest about it. And that pains me. For it is most unlike me.. truly.

But this hatred rose up.. and like the dragon and the kin, I found that my desire to put down the evil troll rogue is consumptive. When he appeared at the memorial for Uthas, I.. felt such a rush of anger. How I despise him!! I wanted his blood to flow and if it was by my hand, even better. I found myself sounding much like Andi.. and very much unlike myself.

What has happened? Where is Alishe? Where is the sense of self that I always depended upon? How will I ever get it back?

Last night, Gashie gave me a nickname. He now refers to me as Miss Fawn. (He has this thing about calling people by animal names, do not ask me.. I don't know. He's a strange but sweet and amusing little gnome.) I found it strange that I would be thought of as a fawn. His description of a fawn was that it was ""Sweet, innocent, graceful and optimistic."" 

Am I those things? Right now... I do not feel such.

I have much work ahead of me. If I am to find my way back to the balance that is my true self. If I am to be the best wife and patner for my beloved Dor'ano. If I am to be a proper ""mother"" to Meep and ready myself for a time when mayhaps Elune will see fit to bless us again. I must work through this anger and overcome it. Unlike my father, I must not be taken over and claimed by it.

And this means faith. The question remains... Do I have enough?"

"event","Ultang shouting at her. Ethel telling her that she could never understand a thing about family because she was not a dwarf. The words kept clashing through Alishe's brain until she felt like she would just rise up and scream. 

Alishe had done everything she could for the gang that night... and she gave them her all, just as she always did.. and it didn't matter. Alishe was devastated by this.

It had always been the Kaldorei who were accused of prejudice to the extreme, but what Alishe had thrown at her went beyond anything she experienced watching her kin do to others. And even if her people were capable of such things, Alishe certainly wasn't among their number.

She was fully aware that she would never be a ""Boomstick"". She wasn't a dwarf, she would never carry a boomstick. But she traveled with many of them, happily so, whenever they asked. 

Homrend was family to her. One of her closest friends. She spent many hours with him in dangerous places. The last thing Alishe ever wanted was for something to happen to him. When Homrend told her about the Orb of Deception that he intended to use to trick Meliza into thinking he was Meep, Alishe was against it. She told him point blank that it was too risky. If Meliza figured it out.. she could kill Homrend. But he was determined.. and they could come up with no other alternative.

Alishe swore she would stay by Homrend's side as he pretended to be Meep. She didn't want anything to happen to him. So into stealth she went, following the false Meep as closely as she could, whispering to him when she was able.

Some of the Boomsticks were kind to her. Others... very disrespectful and downright hurtful to the one who held their clan in very high esteem. ""Go worship the moon! Isn't that tha' what yer kind do?"" The dwarven priest snapped at Alishe after she told him repeatedly that Reeza was not.. Reeza.. anymore. She was told that she didn't know what she was talking about. She didn't know Reeza and she didn't know the gang, therefore.. Alishe apparently had the knowledge of a slug. 

Yet it was Alishe that Meliza spoke to. It was Alishe who was attacked trying to protect the daughter of Reeza. It was Alishe who spent hours researching into this to find out what could be done, if anything to bring Reeza back. But of course, since she was not a dwarf and not part of the gang, Alishe didn't know a thing about that which she spoke.

Alishe crossed behind Reeza as she sneered at ""Meep"" and begged her to come closer. Hope suddenly appeared and Alishe feared what was happening with Meep to have her companion suddenly disappear. But Hope was determined to aid Alishe in the defeat of Meliza. Alishe stared at Ultang, who was not himself. He was poisoned and being controlled by Meliza. Alishe tried to get someone in the gang to use an ice trap so they could get Ultang away, but no one seemed to move. If Reeza got too close to ""Meep"", she could try to drain her of her power.. which would result in the death of Homrend. 

So out of stealth, Alishe attacked Reeza.. determined to bring her down enough that someone could get Ultang and Homrend out of harm's way. This did not happen. 

Alishe brought Meliza to her knees, not wanting to harm to the body of Reeza.. and as she turned, it was straight into one of Ultang's axes that she came. ""No hurt master!"" Ultang wheezed at her. Alishe blinked. How was she going to fight against someone she also called friend? Alishe defended herself, trying to parry each of the blows that Ultang's razor sharp axes brought and finally she remembered the extra rememdy she had brewed which laid in her bag. If she could get him still.. maybe she could cure him. It was Hope's remedy.. the one which had saved her from a horrible poison wound.. she could only hope that it would work on Ultang as well.

While Alishe took blow after blow from Ultang, she and Ethel tried to get the remedy into Ultang. Alishe tried to ignore the pain he was bringing to her, determined to bring the Boomsticks back their leader. And while Alishe fought for her and the life of Ultang... Homrend, as Meep, disappeared into the portal.

""WHAT?!?!"" Alishe gasped when she was told. ""NO!!!!"" She screamed out. Ultang had collapsed to the ground and was breathing normally. She was hesitant to leave his side, but if she didn't move soon, Meliza would go through the portal as well and all would be lost.

Ultang rose and shook his head, as if he was trying to clear it. He ran toward the platform straight at the pretender. ""Pink hurt Meep!"" He roared at her as Reeza cackled. Alishe remembered what Hope had told her.. and glanced at her blade, which was covered in something which she was told would pacify Meliza and subdue her.

""Fight me for Meep"" Alishe spoke slowly, trying not to have her voice crack or to show how scared she really was. ""Fight me. Winner gets Meep."" Reeza sneered as she saw Hope by Alishe's feet. ""YOU!"" She screamed. ""I will skin you alive you worthless thing!"" Alishe just grinned wickedly at Reeza. ""He's helping me. And I'm waiting... Fight me for Meep."" Alishe knew that if she lost.. Meliza would most likely kill her, but Alishe tried to keep her mind focused. She had to try to get Homrend back. She had to try.

Meliza covered Reeza's blades in a horrible poison and flashed a nasty grin at Alishe, telling her that soon she would feel the full affect of poison that she had never known before. Alishe just looked at her calmly. ""I will cure whatever you throw out. Do you worst. But you WILL fall."" 

They stared at each other for a few moments, neither seeming to want to make the first move. Ultang kept circling ""Reeza"", almost taunting her into doing something to him. ""Ultang.. move.. please!"" Prydion stared at Alishe. He knew he couldn't change her mind and he was hoping that this night would not turn him from a new husband into a widower. He did not want to lose Alishe, but he knew that arguing with her, especially at this moment.. would do no good. He had to trust her.

Meliza cloaked and Alishe got ready for the strike. She was sapped and then hit with the duel blades of Reeza repeatedly. Alishe freed herself and moonfired back. Sapped again... rip, slash, tear.. The pain was to a point that Alishe couldn't feel it anymore. ""Homrend"" Alishe told herself. All that matter was Homrend. Even if they brought each other to the ground, she would get Homrend free.

""I call upon the roots to entangle Reeza!"" Alishe's mind called to the ground beneath Meliza and soon Meliza was trapped. ""I don't want to kill Meep's mother"" Alishe thought desperately. But what other choice did she have? Meliza certainly wasn't going to hold back from killing her! The roots were hacked away and Meliza began the charge. Alishe turned into a cat and tore into Meliza until suddenly... Reeza's body fell to the ground. Prydion checked her pulse... 

Dead. 

Reeza was dead. 

Slain by the hand of Alishe.

Alishe fell to her knees and sobbed. Meep was going to hate her. The gang was going to hate her. All those who loved Reeza and did not understand that Reeza was no longer a part of that body were going to look at Alishe as being evil and rotten. Alishe was too upset to even realize that Homrend should have come back from the portal by now. With Meliza dead, the spell would be broken.. but Homrend did not return.

The Boomsticks looked around in confusion. Alishe continued to hold her head in her hands and cry. Moments passed. Nothing happened. 

Then Alishe saw a cloud of smoke around the fallen body of Reeza.. and Meliza rose back up to her feet and cloaked.. slowly walking backwards. She was wounded horribly. ""The one taken, is released to come back."" Meliza wheezed as she coughed up blood. ""Meliza, give Reeza back her body!"" Alishe shouted to her. Ultang stared in disbelief at Alishe, not sure he heard her clearly. ""Meliza?"" Alishe did not respond, her focus was upon Meliza as she made her way back to the portal. 

Meliza paused.. and for a moment, it seemed like Reeza had taken her place. ""Are you the one who cares for Meep?"" Reeza looked Alishe straight in the eyes as Alishe knelt before her. Alishe teared up. ""I am."" Reeza nodded to her and then disappeared back into the portal.

There was still no sign of Homrend. And Madra let Alishe know that Meep had run off.. heading directly for them. 

Chaos ran rampant as dwarves began lashing out at Prydion and Alishe for putting Homrend in harm's way. Even though, it was not their plan and Alishe had done everything, save sacrifice herself to try to get Homrend back to them. Prydion had only barely known what Homrend intended to do and yet he seemed to take even more attacks than Alishe did. Ultang, who moments before had try to rip Alishe in two under the spell of Meliza, was now shouting at her to explain where Homrend was. Alishe just fell to her knees.

The ones she had called friends.. apparently did not think of her the same way. She would always be a token ""long ears"". The one they would call upon when they needed healing, but never a true part of the gang. All because she was not a dwarf. 

They spoke of family.. but seemed to see family as different than Alishe.

Her family.. her husband.. a human.. her new daughter.. a gnome. To Alishe, they weren't classified by their race, but by their hearts. She loved the spirits of Prydion and Meep. The packages did not matter to her. Was she rare in this?

She had always been an outsider to the Kaldorei she lived around. Why would this be any different?

Alishe lashed out at Ethel, determined to get someone to see reason. ""I have done everything I could to show my loyalty to the gang. I have done everything I could to try to save those that I cared for! I took blows from Ultang while trying to give him a remedy, which saved him from the slavery he was bound in. I fought Meliza to get Homrend's freedom. What more would you have of me? What more should I have done? It's not enough!""

Alishe tried to keep Meep calm, because the last thing they needed was Meep's powers exploding because she was angry at those who lashed out at the people she considered parents. But inside, Alishe was torn in a turmoil of emotion. She was angry, that her contribution meant nothing.. all because of her cultural background. She was devastated because those she considered friends.. family.. turned on her at a moment's notice.. after she had shed blood for them. Been poisoned for them.. 

Alishe paused.. realizing that she had not cured herself and quietly as the gang shouted and cried out, Alishe sipped from the vial trying to counter the poison which began to seep through her blood. Meliza was not jesting.. this poison was stronger than before.. and if Alishe was not mistaken, deadly.

Ultang and Prydion went off to speak alone.. and Alishe continued to cry foul to Ethel, who finally just did not know what to say or do. She patted Alishe's shoulder uncomfortably and admitted that Alishe had done all she could. Alishe had left Meep's side to find a place where she could cry without upsetting Meep more. Ethel had followed. Alishe sobbed unable to control herself any longer.

Homrend had been freed, yet he did not appear. And it seemed like all eyes were upon them. She and her Dor'ano.. to ""fix"" it. 

Alishe had to ask herself.. if it had been her.. would they have screamed and been as upset? The answer was a resounding no. Reality set in hard at that moment. Alishe was accepted as long as she knew her place. She would never be clan. She would never be truly family to them and truth be told... to several, she would never even be a friend.

She was crestfallen and defeated. It had been one of the most difficult nights ever for Alishe. And when Meep asked her to talk for a moment, Alishe was almost scared of what Meep would say. ""Meep did some thinking while Meep ran here, after Meep found out that Hope got scared. Meep wondered if Meep saw the fight, who would Meep help?"" Meep paused and Alishe sighed softly, biting her lip. ""Meep knew she would help her.. mum.."" Alishe lowered her eyes and nodded. Of course Meep would help Reeza, it was the way it should be. ""That nasty gnomie wouldn't have known what hit her!"" Meep finished. Alishe blinked. 

Alishe stared at Meep in disbelief. What was Meep saying? Alishe whispered to her asking her to say it again. ""Meep think that of Miss Alishe.. if that what Miss Alishe want.."" Alishe hugged Meep fiercely. Her heart torn in two. She had a daughter that she was clinging to desperately. A baby who was never born into anywhere but Alishe's heart. But here sat a daughter of flesh and blood and one who loved her as much as Alishe loved Meep. ""I couldn't ask for a more wonderful daughter than you Meep."" Alishe whispered as her eyes filled with tears.

After they collected themselves, Alishe and Meep went to find Dor'ano. After walking with Madra back to the gryphons of Duskwood, they parted ways.. the three heading back to their home at Ironforge. Prydion and Alishe tucked in Meep. Prydion paused mid-sentence as Meep called Alishe ""mum"" again. He wasn't sure how Alishe would react and just grinned as she blushed a little and kissed Meep's forehead.

It had been a difficult night. Dor'ano was showing signs of being sick and he assured her that it was a common cold. But Alishe fretted anyway. Overwhelmed, stressed and quite upset.. Alishe attempted to go to sleep.. but she would find no rest that night."

Alishe looked at the words in her journal but they barely registered. She had written them. In the hopes of consoling herself for the decision she was about to make, but not much was helping her right now. With a heavy heart and a deep sigh, Alishe rose from the table and made her way down to the guild offices of Ironforge. She waited to be acknowledged and then sat down and explained the situation.

She bit her lip as a book was placed before her. ""Sign yer name here lass."" The dwarven man said, looking very unimpressed by Alishe's emotion about the situation. Alishe couldn't blame him. He was just doing his job. Besides, people did this all the time, right?

Not Alishe.

The pen quivered in Alishe's hand and she wrote her name. ""Who 're ye gonna name as new leader lass? Ye got ta name someone."" Alishe blinked. What? More decisions? Bloody hell!! It was then that Aurora awoke and before Alishe thought about it, she scribbled the name of her elder sister on the line for new guild leader. She could only hope that Aurora wouldn't let it go to her head and that Cheriss wouldn't be angry with her for giving their sister the power over the guild.

Slowly she put down the pen and sighed heavily. It was done.

Alishe was no longer the ""Emerald Lady"". 

She was no longer guilded. 

She could only hope that her friends and family would understand that her leaving was not leaving them. But as Aurora assured her once they spoke.. it was only leaving a title.

""Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end."" Alishe remembered the bard's song as she made her way back to the house she now shared with Prydion and their ward Meep. She quietly slipped into bed next to her new husband. And as silently as she could manage... Alishe cried herself to sleep."

"event","One day until the wedding... Alishe was going over her notebook trying to make sure that everything on her lists were taken care of. She forced herself to take a deep breath as the nervousness was working its way back into her again. It didn't help that things had gotten quite stressful life-wise just before the ceremony either.

Meep had reappeared into their lives again. Alishe had missed her desperately but didn't know where the young gnome had gone off to. Not until the whisper came on the night of the rehearsal. Meep's voice trembled as she relayed to Alishe how Reeza, Meep's very own mother, had attacked and almost killed Meep. Alishe felt ill thinking about it. How could a mother attack her own child like that? 

Something deep inside of her told her that this could not be Reeza. Something was amiss. And they had to find out what it was. 

Alishe and Meep spoke for a bit and then Meep headed back to the house she shared with her grandmother. Unfortunately, there would be no rest for the poor gnome because she and her ""Grammy"" were attacked. Her grandmother fought off the attacker, while Meep ran. However, Meep was injured, quite severely before she managed to get away.

When Alishe found out, she immediately went in search of Meep. She found her surrounded by a warrior and warlock that Alishe did not know, as well as Ultang and Amyliana. Alishe rushed up to Meep, trying to soothe her as best she could while assessing the damage that had been done to the young girl's body. Alishe healed Meep and it wasn't long before Meep wanted to go in search of her grandmother. But it was too late, her grandmother had been slain. Meep was now without a home.

Something deeply maternal struck up in Alishe and before she knew what had come over her, she was offering Meep a place to stay with them. All she wanted was to care for Meep and to keep her safe. Her love for Meep was so intense that she had to constantly remind herself that Meep was not her daughter and that Meep had a mother, whom she needed desperately. 

Alishe would do all she could to get Reeza back for Meep. This she swore to herself.

Well.. this had caused major drama in the already stressed and chaotic life of Alishe and Prydion. But they were doing their best to work with it and adjust, all the while finishing up the preparations for the wedding.

Alishe drew her fingertips along her mooncloth robe again. ""Tomorrow I will wear this for Dor'ano. Tomorrow, the world will know me as his wife, which I have been for over two months now. Tomorrow, it will be a celebration and affirmation of our love and all that we've endured. May it be all that we hope and wish it to be."""

"event","Alishe's mind was awhirl with thought. Mental check list upon mental check list piling up. Chaand had been given all the fireworks that she had bought a couple of weeks ago. She was also taking care of the food. Ale would have to be someone else's responsibility and Alishe would remind Dor'ano of that. The women all had their robes, but a few still needed sandals. If only she could remember who they were! And the men, oy. They still needed twill belts and boots to finish their attire. Would they have it in time? 

Slowly she sorted through her bags, sighing at the few potions that remained and reminding herself that she did not have the herbs currently to restock them. A herb hunt had to happen soon. Goldthorn, Blindweed, Silversage, Sansam... those were the big ones. Alishe made a note in her herb book and gathered her things together. 

She changed out of the brand new runecloth robe that Rane had made for her and into her armor. Oh how she loved her wildheart kilt. More than she could say! However, she had to admit that she was not looking very forward to the day when she earned the shoulder armor that went with. Something about huge black wings near her face just... made her cringe. 

Alishe glanced at the place where her beloved's sleeping form was and she couldn't help but smile. In just a few days he would be her husband openly. They would exchange their vows before the alliance and horde alike and it was her sincere hope that the day would be all that they both deeply wished it would be and more. 

He sighed in his sleep and she crept slowly over to him and knelt down quietly. Gingerly, she brushed the hair from his eyes and bent down to gently press her lips against his forehead. ""O fulo osa Dor'ano."" She whispered and lingered only long enough to see him smile softly. She smiled in return and then rose to leave the room.

Much to do and her nervousness was almost as big as her excitement was."

"event","<i>Last night, Dor'ano and I adventured through Ashenvale, in search for a place for our wedding. Little did we know that we'd find much more than that. We found a home as well. 

A beautiful little house set back against the mountains with a wide open space before it. Not far from the temple of Aessina. Mind you, the animals seem to think they own it as well and one wolf in particular actually visited the interior of the house multiple times, but you can't very well blame them. After all, the forest does belong to them as well. Even they are much more hostile than they were in my youth.

It is near this house that Dor'ano and I will be married. We hope to call the house ""home"" on the occasions that we can find ourselves in the area and I've been warned that we may be sharing the space with others. 

Which is the norm for Azeroth. I don't think anyone really has space that they can truly and entirely call theirs. They can lay claim to it.. but when they are gone they can't stop others from residing there as well.

It's been a huge frustration for me. The not having space to call our own. Mind you, the room at the forge has been where I've slept for many many nights, but so do others. And one plain room, with no dressings save for a planter box which I gifted the room so it would not be so horribly drab does not a home make.

I was walking on a cloud last night, looking around my childhood playground and thinking about living there again. In a house with Dor'ano. Maybe someday.. if Elune is willing.. our child running around the grassy paths with us.

I never told Dor'ano that I thought about that.. as I was afraid it would bring up heavy and difficult emotions. It did for me just thinking it. Yet at the same time, it was comforting. To think about having a family there. Raising my child in the same forests that I was raised myself. Starting a family and seeing it grow. That truly would be something.

But for now, I shall start with a wedding. A wedding that will happen in two weeks and I still have no idea what Dor'ano or his groomsmen will wear! But a wedding nonetheless. And a house. Simple, beautiful and hopefully ours when we have need of it. I haven't felt so at home somewhere in a very long time. 

I needed that feeling.. more than I can say."

"event","Alishe sorted through the herbs in her bags and flipped through her alchemy book. On a plain piece of paper she jotted down what she had verses what she would need to make the potions that she and those she cared about relied upon for their journeys. Even deep in concentration, it was obvious that this was her joy. 

Carefully, she set down the goldthorn and then picked up the sungrass. She definitely would need more ghost mushroom. With a slight grin and a soft laugh she made the note on her paper. Plaguebloom was in short supply as well, which meant more time spent with undead in the plaguelands. 

Alishe grimaced a little. She just could not stomach that place. The corruption of the land tore at her, much like Felwood, but she never had to spend as much time there as she seemed to in the plaguelands. It just made her skin crawl. With a resigned sigh she glanced at the liferoot wondering where her bruiseweed had gone to.

She sorted through the bags which carried her potions and made note of what was needing to be immediately stocked and also made note of the things she knew Dor'ano would need himself. With the way that man gave out her potions, she would need to make sure she always kept extra waiting for him. Else he go without. 

Generous to a fault her husband was. Alishe grinned wryly remembering yet another opportunity for a better weapon that he passed on. Why he always felt the need to turn down things was beyond her. However, it was his way and she respected that. At least she had Conneur on her side. He would see to it that Dor'ano would get the things he needed, he had assured her of that.

With a little groan, Alishe stretched and leaned back against the wall of their room. Dor'ano had already gone out for an adventure and soon she would follow. She desperately needed to visit the crater again and gather crystals. She had gotten quite used to using the crystal restore charge she could transmute there and the two she had left simply would not do.

Her mind whirled with all that needed to be done yet. Tonight, she had to try to get Dor'ano to Ashenvale to see the place she had in mind for the wedding. Hopefully fate would be accommodating and they could make it there before some pressing task or grand adventure put itself in their path.

Alishe picked up the note from her beloved again and smiled. He had given her Arthas tears that he found and his words, while very few, were beautiful and sweeter than candy. She said a silent prayer to Elune for the man she loved and slowly put away the herbs.

Time was not going to wait for her, that was for certain."

"event","<i>Life has been so consumed with traveling into dangerous places that it's left little to no time for my journal. Something I mean to amend.

Plans continue to be made for our wedding and yet we are still not remotely finished with them. Hopefully by the end of this week, that will be different and we'll have more finished. I'm trying not to be stressed by it all, but I admit a little bit of the worry is creeping in. Especially when I am starting to be asked about details like I am. 

Friends want to know things and when I don't have answers, I start to feel more pressured than before. I know this will turn out well, I know it. But wow, what an adventure it's been just to get this far! 18 days until Dor'ano and I speak our vows in public. It shall fly by, I know it!

I continue to learn and grow in my abilities, even with the top of my ""strength"" being reached. I've experienced different ways of attacking the same targets and it's been a growth experience to say the least. Some good, some not so good, but I take it all with me. Hopefully in time, I can be a good leader myself with the parties I pull together. In the meanwhile, I pay attention and learn all I can.

Last night, Dor'ano and I decided to take a task on just for fun. The reward offered was a hat. Anyone who knows Dor'ano and I knows that we adore clothing. Yes, this is a huge understatement and I know it. Anyway, we took the task not knowing what this bloody hat would be like, only that we must slay water elementals to get cores from them. 

Apparently they seemed to favor me as they just would not yield the cores up to my beloved but I garnered them rather quickly. How he loved teasing me about this!

We had so much fun though. Dor'ano fought them without a weapon, seeking to improve his hand to hand combat and I was almost entirely feral. (Something I rarely do as I have not trained for that aspect of my talents at all.) To just charge and pounce! Now that was definitely good fun.

In the end, we garnered our cores and came back to claim our hats. Imagine our shock and well... surprise I suppose is a good word.. to discover they were horrid yellow! I laugh even now remembering. It did not flatter me at all, even though Dor'ano said it looked better on me than him. (I beg to differ, he could pull it off much more easily than I could!) 

I sold mine as quickly as I could once we got back to the forge. I wasn't about to let that bloody ugly cap keep space in my bags! But Dor'ano says he's keeping his. I find this rather strange, but amusing. I cannot imagine Dor'ano finding anything to match that hat. It's truly that bad."

"event","<i>The good news:

I have made my final ascension. I am now 60 season strong. It took me far longer than most but I am not ashamed of that fact. I have always said that it's the journey that counts, not the destination. And my journey has been an amazing one. 

Filled with triumph and challenge. Pitfalls and success. I have made many friends and have found my true love. I've perfected the art of harvesting the herbs I love so dearly and have mastered the recipes of many potions which are highly useful to myself and those who I care about. I have gone from a nervous druid, who feared fighting to a competent druid, whose skill in healing is growing stronger by the day.

What an amazing path it's been. The journey to the top of my strength. I have no regrets. I worked hard to get where I am. I earned every single season I have and the fact that I can say that fills me with much pride. 

As nervous as I was to get of finally making it here, I am glad now. I know it is not the end, only the beginning. There is still much to do, much to learn. And my strength.. is measured in more than seasons alone.

The bad news:

We went into the dream last night. Ceil, Chelody and I. To try to find the Keltarin I once knew. My childhood friend. It was tedious and tore at me. You see, the Keltarin that I've known... was never really the one I grew up with. Aye, it's complicated and I'm still trying to sort it all out. But that incarnation is actually.. a dragon. 

Oh Elune, how you like your irony...

We found him.. and he told us that he had no intention of going back. It was more important to him to search for his wife in the dream than to be with those who cared about him. When the call was made to the druids to come and fight the scourge, my friend did not heed it. Thusly, another took his place. Another who fought with us.. who essentially saved my life. Who became the truest friend I could ever ask for. All because he and I both thought he was the man I spent my childhood with. Imagine our shock to realize that he was not.

I lashed out at the Keltarin I knew. Called him a coward. My anger still burns. In his selfishness, he left those of us who cared for him, who needed him.. without his aid. He abandoned us. I cannot fathom such a thing. This is not the soul I knew. Or thought I knew. 

Mayhaps I never truly knew him at all.

He actually tried to reason with me. Asking me what would I do if I knew that my daughter was in the dream somewhere. How this angered me! I quickly replied that I would not be so selfish as to turn my back on those who needed me, even in search of my own child. He seemed to make light of my grief, as if I didn't understand loss. 

Me... the one who watched my father and brother go off to war all because of hate. Me... who watched the man whom I was betrothed to follow them.. not for hate, but for the love of me. A man whom I could not love the way he did me. Not because I didn't try, but because we were not joined the way that my Dor'ano and I are. I am not sure I have ever forgiven myself for Tailion's death. In fact, I barely speak of it.

But I know loss. Mayhaps not in the same way he did. But I know it in ways he could never imagine.

Overall, I am devastated by what went on there. I must now come to terms with the fact that my childhood friend is gone. He is never coming back. The one who has taken his place is not the same. And yet, what he is.. means a tremendous amount to me. Still, he is a dragon. He is dragonkin. His kind are my enemy now. How do I make peace with this? 

I know not.

And Ceil.. what happened to Ceil? She did not wake from the dream as Chelody and I did. Chelody had Rhel to latch on to.. to help guide her back. She ran with all her might back to him. I used my link with Dor'ano.. and followed Chelody as quickly as I could. But somehow, we lost Ceil. She did not wake. And while I spoke to the one who appeared in the place of Keltarin.. a slight girl named Ysy... a wave of weariness overtook me and I fainted. 

So I don't know what happened. Answers. I must seek answers today. I must find out what happened to Ceil.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((My bloody server decided to die on me just at the end of the rp. ARGH. Hate that when that happens!

And yes... I *finally* hit 60.. and as proof of just how long my ""journey"" really was.. I offer up this little tidbit. *grin*

"event","<i>It's been almost two weeks since we were dealt the crushing blow. When the joy of our lives was taken from us. And I'm sure it's not surprising to know that Dor'ano and I are still dealing with many deep and tender emotions as a result.

But even with all of that strife. All of the uncertainty. All of the doubt. All of the pain. We've endured. We've banded together even more than we were before and have leaned on each other for strength. For the first time in my life, I have witnessed the power of a ""partnership"" and I am awed by it. We hit the edge and we still come back. Why? Because our kind of love endures. Through the worst of the storm, it never falters or fades. To say that I am blessed seems like such a simplistic and lacking way of expressing how I feel in regards to being with Dor'ano. 

He loves me in a way that I've never thought existed. When I'm with him, I am... home. Even though we've experienced one of the most devastating losses imaginable, we still endure. We still grow. We still learn. We still look to one another for strength, support and love. 

Our wedding will truly be an affirmation of it all and I cannot wait for that day to arrive!

The plans for our wedding continue to grow and take shape. I changed my mind on what attire I wanted for everyone once I received and tried on the glorious mooncloth robe that Chaand arranged to have made for me. I could only stare at myself in the mirror dumb-founded. I couldn't believe I was looking at myself. It seemed like someone else had taken my place. Someone far more beautiful and stunning than I could ever be. And that robe... I always called it the ""robe of dreams"" and it is. It truly is.

The change in my attire made it necessary to change my bridesmaid dresses as well. Which in the end, is a blessing because the silver-thread robes are a pain to get! Not that these robes are tremendously easier, but they are more readily available. 

There is one snag that I must work my way through. I've asked the lovely and wonderful Chaand to stand up with me along with my sisters and best friend Caja. For very personal reasons, Chaand must be wearing a hat. We found a hat that matches the robe perfectly, but I'm afraid this will cause chaos among my sisters who are still trying to convince me to allow them wear things that just do not go with their robes at all. Talk about a quandary! I am hoping that either they will be alright with Chaand wearing a hat and no one else, or somehow we get blessed enough to find other hats for everyone else. It will be a challenge.

Of course, the men's attire has not be settled upon. Dor'ano and I are still trying to decide how to make the men match the women and of course make Dor'ano the stunning groom that I know he will be. All this and we have not gotten our ceremony completed or even our location settled upon yet! We still need a photographer and someone to cater for us as well.

Much to do and a month to get it done in. Once we settle upon a time and get the affirmation of those we want to stand up with us, we will post an announcement so that others can hopefully attend! I've never been very good at being around crowds, but for this event.. I do hope that we are able to gather many of our friends around us. It will make the day even grander for us both."

"event","<i>I look around me and everywhere.. I see ranks. And I have to wonder to myself, how many of us are left that are without rank among the army of the alliance now? How many of us have resisted the call to battle and are trying to take our lives in the direction we see fit and not be at the whim and order of some superior officer? 

I don't want to be drafted into this battle. I don't want to forgo being simply Alishe in favor of Private Alishe or whatever higher rank there is. I care for it not. I want it not. 

But it's coming. The time is coming and I can feel it. I can't stay out of this forever. At some point, I will be a part of this war. I will earn my rank by aiding the killing of horde. This pleases me not. Right now, I have zero kills to my name. None. I wonder how many others can say the same? Very few at my season. Very few.

I am almost to the top of my strength. In a few days, I will have reached it. And then everything changes. People say it's not the end, but the beginning. Yet, part of me feels a bit nervous about it. What happens now? When the experience stops being the important drive. When rewards are all you look for. 

Aye, I still have much of my armor to attain. I only have my kilt (and aye, I know how lucky I am that the baron dropped it the first time I went!) and my gloves. But I refuse to allow the pursuit of such things dictate my time either.

It's strange. I spent time consoling Dor'ano as he reached this place. The 60th season. I tried to reassure him that all would be well and that I was excited about the prospect of reaching it myself. But now... I'm here and I'm nervous. I'm anxious. It's strange how that works.

Now I must decide where I shall be when that final ascension hits. I want to be somewhere fun and interesting. I want it to be memorable. But the question is what.. Hmmmmm... Hmmmm... Hmmmm..."

"event","<i>The good: Raels

An undead rogue with amazing skills. I have loved watching Raels fight when I've gotten the chance to. I cannot recall if I've ever fought against Raels, but I have much respect for this awesome rogue. We were flagged in Felwood and easy prey while trying to aid a warlock with her infernal. But Raels did not attack, nor did any of the horde who were there. Raels hugged me. Even if there had been a fight, I know bloody well it would have been honorable. I expect nothing else from Raels.

The bad: Celun

Another undead rogue. We help each other through a nasty piece of Jadenar. I'm thinking, hmmmm maybe the horde aren't so bad after all. I keep getting more affirmation that they do have honor among their ranks. But no, he shows his true colors when he teams up with...

The downright ugly: Fourfingers

Yes, that's right. It was undead rogue night in Felwood. 

Now, I've had one.. and I mean one.. decent and honorable fight with Fourfingers in Ashenvale. That's it. I have been corpse camped by Fourfingers. I have been slain while sitting down by Fourfingers. I have been attacked while Fourfingers didn't even have her war banner flying. And yet, Fourfingers continues to look down her decaying nose at the alliance for having no honor.

We aid her companion and she encourages him to slay us. Typical. Exactly what I've come to expect from Fourfingers. I hope you both choke on the ""honor"" you earned tonight. Pathetic. Both of you.

I was sitting down Four, that means I don't want to fight you. I didn't fight you back. I didn't lift a finger against you. You had to have noticed that. Still you attacked. Before that, you attacked me without your banner up, which you've critized others for doing to you. Then, after it's all said and done, you apologize?? Why? You aren't sorry. And if you are, then you realize that you shouldn't have done what you did to begin with and that makes even less sense. (The same goes for Celun, who also apologized as soon as he slew me the first time.)

Maybe you digested some respect out of my corpse, but I highly doubt it. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dor'ano says that he wear his war banner because it gives opportunity for people to show the best in themselves. The idea that someone would choose not to attack or would give you the opportunity to a fair and honorable battle. To be surprised by those who instead of attacking choose to aid you in your endeavors like Azurena did the other night in the plaguelands and like we did Celun tonight in Felwood, before he betrayed that kindness by slaying us with Fourfingers. 

Normally, I do not argue against Dor'ano wearing his banner.. and thusly, I end up wearing mine as a result because I heal him and I give my blessings to him. But tonight, I actually asked him to take it down, for I could not handle being attacked by Fourfingers anymore. Normally, I would never do such a thing. I know that this is the path he has chosen and I respect it. However, having my flag up as a result of this does not mean that I wish to be torn down by those who have no honor. But apparently it will be the case.

I suppose I will just have to adjust. They certainly aren't going to adjust for me. That has been driven home tonight quite well by Fourfingers.

Disgusted. Frustrated. Angry. 

That's me tonight."

"event","They talked a little that night, but mainly just sought comfort in each other's arms. And every time that Alishe looked the least bit worried, Prydion would immediately smile at her and say, ""O fulo osa Ishura. We'll be alright."" Then he'd kiss her again and hold her tightly against him. She tried to find complete comfort in his words and in his arms, but the pain still lingered.

How would they ever get past this? How would they ever truly heal? This had been their dream. And for Prydion, it had been a dream that he had held for a lot longer than Alishe had. She hadn't even considered a family before he came along. It just.. didn't seem to be part of the plan for her life. Then she found the home she had wanted. It was with him. Where ever they were, it was home. Simply because they were together. That changed everything. 

And now, it had been given and then taken away almost as quickly. How would they move forward. Did she dare to hope that Elune would bless them again? That somehow the vision she had at the temple of Elune would be realized? Alishe closed her eyes and leaned against Prydion's shoulder, sighing softly.

Laughter. A child's laughter. The sweet melody of a happy little girl. 

Laughter. Prydion's laughter echoing against the sound before it. Harmonizing with it as it became the most beautiful music Alishe had ever heard in her life.

There they were, sitting in a field. Tall grass and a few flowers. The breeze gently blowing against them. Clouds slowly moving in the bright blue sky. The sounds of life all around them. But mainly.. laughter. Alishe stared at them. A beautiful little girl of about seven sat across from Prydion. Her hair matching his perfectly. Tiny pointed ears, at least compared to Alishe's, broke through the hair.. giving away her elven heritage. Her skin.. almost like fine porcelain, but with a very faint bluish hue somewhat like her mother. Tiny delicate hands held up a flower for Prydion to inspect. If only Alishe could see her face! What color were her eyes? Alishe couldn't tell.

Alishe sighed again and Prydion kissed her forehead. He frowned a little. Nothing he was doing seemed to help bring his wife out of this depression she was in. And the more pain he felt from her, the more pain he felt nag away at himself. He wondered silently if she really knew how much he needed her. And then she spoke in a silent whisper. ""Dor'ano.. I need you so much. Please don't leave me.""

Prydion squeezed her tightly. ""I will not leave you my precious wife. We are forever Alishe. I love you. We will get through this together."" Alishe relaxed a little in his arms, feeling very tired all of the sudden. Truth be told, Prydion was weary as well. They found a safe place to sleep and curled up together, both drifted off fairly quickly.

Laughter filled her mind. Their laughter. Would she ever hear it for real? Or would it always be this dream just out of reach. ""Come back to me"" Alishe whispered in her dream. ""Come back to me please..."" And when Alishe woke up, she was crying. Prydion must have been restless, for she found herself alone. His cloak was wrapped around her tightly, but he was nowhere to be found. Alishe clung to the cloak and tried to calm herself. His scent against her skin gave her some comfort, but not nearly enough.

It was morning and the light in the sky was growing steadily. She had a few things she wanted to do this day before attending Uthas service and was determined to leave the crater. She knew that Prydion loved the place, but it seemed to close in on Alishe. She needed more air. She needed different surroundings. She needed.. her friends.. her family. And oh how she needed him. She would try to convince him to go the service with her. It would do them both good. She was certain of it.

The day passed by in a blur. Alishe managed a few whispers to those who wondered what happened to her. It was difficult, to say the least, to have to repeat the words, ""We lost the baby"" more than a few times, but Alishe did her best to keep herself together. She wouldn't lie about her pain. She didn't want to be pitied. She just wanted to heal and move forward. Dor'ano had taught her that when she was facing difficulty, that was when she needed to reach out for help.. and this was one of the most difficult things she had ever endured.

Everyone was very supportive, kind and understanding. A couple of times, the only communication was done through letters, but no one seemed to be upset by that. Sometimes the written word is easier to handle than speaking. Especially when the heart just doesn't want to hear those words anymore. The more she talked though, the more it made it real to her. The pregnancy.. and the loss. She needed that validation. It was real to her. Very real. But no one else could see the changes she was going through. No one else could feel what she was feeling. And now that the baby was gone, Alishe still looked the same as she always did. No one would know she was different, except by the distraught look upon her face and the devastated hurt in her eyes. 

Alishe made her way to the bay where Uthas was to speak. Prydion was out of reach and while this worried Alishe, she tried to make the best of it. Prydion needed his time and she respect that. He would come back to her. He would always come back to her. This he swore. She must have faith. Alishe paused. Faith... She sighed deeply. Did she have faith anymore? Faith in what? That all would work out to good again down the road? She believed in Prydion and she believed he loved her. But was that the same as faith? She couldn't say. She just knew that having faith in anything else seemed almost impossible.

She waited by the rooftop of the bank and sat silently. There was quite a bit of dancing going on not too far away, but Alishe couldn't hear the music. Her mind whirled on other thoughts. Prydion. Their daughter. The dragon. The blood corruption. The battle. The victory of Ataerno. The loss of their baby. Her eyes began to water up and Alishe fought hard to keep tears at bay. 

Up walked Uthas and Kathartic. Alishe watched them pass and then slowly stood up, walking down upon the rooftop as well. She bowed to them and then found a place to sit down. Kathartic spoke to her for briefly, glad to finally speak to her in person rather than threw the few letters they had exchanged. Alishe felt badly that she just didn't have the heart to be her usually cheerful and friendly self. She so wanted to be more cordial. But it wasn't within her to give.

Thankfully Alishe's sister Cheriss decided to attend the service at the last moment, giving Alishe some familiar company. It was the first time she'd seen her sister since things had happened. Even though Alishe barely spoke, her twin seemed to understand exactly how much Alishe needed her there right then. Uthas began to speak and the more he spoke, the more Alishe felt touched. He spoke of a love and how it had changed him. Alishe inwardly smiled because she understood that sentiment. For being with Dor'ano had changed her too. In ways she couldn't even express.

Then he spoke about the loss of his wife. Suddenly, Alishe was consumed with her own pain and could not stop herself from crying. She didn't want to interrupt his service, but the pain just kept building and building. Maybe it had been too soon. Maybe Dor'ano was right and they still needed time away. Maybe... And then Cheriss' wrapped her arms around her sister and held Alishe close, trying her best to comfort her. It wasn't Prydion, but it was good. Even Jingo comforted Alishe and that meant a lot to her.

Uthas continued to speak and Alishe felt so much impact for every bit of it. She had shut herself away and it only made the pain more unbearable. She would not continue to do it any longer. He was right. Alishe felt compelled that Dor'ano hear his words and when she finally sensed him again, she practically begged him to go to the service. She could feel that he truly did not want to go and if it weren't for the fact that he wanted to do anything to help make her feel better, he would have refused outright.

The second service began, with Prydion at the bay, but Alishe was in Winterspring with her good friend Halton. It had been over a month since they last spoke and so much had changed in Alishe's life. As much as Alishe did not want to abandon Prydion, she felt compelled to spend a little time with her dear friend and to try, as best she could, to share the path her life had taken since they last parted ways. The talking was brief, but it could not be helped. Alishe felt Prydion's discomfort and knew that she needed to be by her husband's side. Thankfully Halton was not upset and bade her well. 

""I heard his words Alishe, but I cannot feel them yet."" Prydion whispered as Alishe made her way to him.

The flight seemed to take forever and by the time Alishe arrived, Uthas was taking questions. Prydion sat alone and Alishe swallowed hard as she saw him there. She fought her feelings of guilt. ""I should not have left him alone. I should not have made him come here by himself. I am letting him down again."" Slowly she walked up to him and took her place next to him. She reached out and held his hand and smiled very softly at him. He looked very pensive and depressed.

The crowd cleared and Prydion was wanting a hasty get away. No doubt not wishing to be caught alone with Uthas. But Alishe hesitated. She didn't like the running away. It was not right. ""Dor'ano, I will not run away like this. We need to reach out to others right now and Uthas cares about you."" But he was walking quickly away. From a distance he whispered to her. ""Alishe, you belong at my side, aye?"" Alishe flinched. Was he ordering her? She clenched her jaw and stood firm. She whispered back. ""I will not run. You need to face this Dor'ano. If you leave, you will do more damage. Come back please."" 

Alishe muttered, ""Bloody stubborn man"" as Uthas walked slowly up to her side. Uthas nodded and sighed. He knew that Prydion hadn't wanted to face him and he also knew that his words had touched Alishe quite deeply. But what else was going on here was a mystery. Uthas looked to Alishe with gentle eyes. ""He is stubborn but he's not a fool Alishe. He will come around."" If only Alishe could believe that. Prydion seemed very set on his grief being the only grief there was. And when he got this way, not even the grief of Alishe could match his. It hurt her, more than she could say.

It was then that Uthas confided that his wife had been pregnant when she was taken by the scourge. Alishe blinked and gasped. Not only had Uthas lost his wife, but his child as well. So many emotions flooded through her as she looked to Uthas. There just weren't words. And that's when Prydion walked back up again. He had come back.

There were a few heated exchanges between Alishe and Prydion before Uthas raised his hand and asked them to both listen. Alishe had been especially upset with Uthas when he told her that perhaps the loss of their baby had been a gift from Elune. Alishe could not accept that! She felt like lashing out at Uthas for even suggesting such a thing, but his voice was calm and soothing as he spoke. His eyes took on a ethereal glow to them. Something was different in those moments. Uthas explained that the baby had been taken back to Elune in order to be cleansed and healed until the time was right for her to join them again. That they would have her back when the time was right. He gave them his word.

Both Alishe and Prydion were shocked and stunned by this. Uthas left them then to find comfort with one another again. And that's what they did. Soft apologies for tempers flaring and endearments exchanged. Alishe and Prydion made their way back to their room in the forge. It had been a long day and they were both emotionally and physically exhausted. And they had much to consider and think about as well."

"event","The morning light was almost upon the horizon when Alishe finally made her way back to Prydion. It had been a very long night. Filled with frustration, failure, triumph and celebration. Alishe slipped off her sandals and laid down her cloak and then very quietly climbed under the covers. Prydion immediately stirred and wearily opened his eyes, squinting at her. 

""Ishura, you were out very late."" He whispered in a sleep-filled voice. Alishe brushed his cheek with her fingertips. ""I am sorry Dor'ano. You know how I am when I am on raids, especially with Homrend. I like to see it through the end."" Prydion smiled a little and nodded. He wrapped her into his arms and held her close, kissing her forehead. ""And then I ran into Chaand, and showed her my new hat."" Prydion gasped. ""You got a new hat?"" Alishe laughed softly. ""Aye, and you might be a bit jealous when you see it love."" Prydion chuckled.

Alishe stiffled a yawn and snuggled in close to her husband. She was so weary. Both physically and emotionally. She had made her way back to the place where Dreamtracker resided. She stood upon the ramp leading to the portal and tried to think of how she would get past him. She even tried to reason with him, but of course, he couldn't be reasoned with. 

The longer she stayed, the more desperate she became. Something about that dream stuck with her. What if he had been right? What if their daughter was in the portal? Right there.. so close to her.. She HAD to see. She had to get past him. Before she knew what she was doing, she was rushing up the ramp. The dragon immediately charged and within a few moments, it was over. Alishe lying cold upon the ramp as Prydion and boomsticks appeared.

The boomsticks had been commissioned by the Windhammer clan to clear that area of all the dragons that had taken it over. When they found Alishe, tempers flared and soon, they charged Dreamstalker in an effort to lay the beast down. It led to defeat. Another attempt. Another defeat. With heavy hearts, they decided that they must gather more and come back to finish the task they had taken on.

Alishe looked upon Prydion and almost began to cry. He seemed so distant. He was devastated to have found his wife slain by yet another dragon. Something in his mind began to fret that it would always be so. Something he could barely handle. He didn't want to lose her. He had lost enough already. He couldn't bare to lose Alishe as well. No more than she could handle losing him.

As she looked on at Dreamstalker, something fierce took hold of her. Something primal.. and dark. It was then that she realized, wholely and completely, that she truly hated his kind. Not just disliked them, but... hated.... them. Alishe who worked her entire life not to allow hatred to take hold of her, was consumed by it. She had been taught to respect the dragons and their kin, but no longer. 

They were corrupt, just like Ataerno. The dragons would pay for her daughter's loss. The dragons would die. She would hunt them with all the power she could muster and their blood would flow at her feet. It wouldn't bring their baby back, but it would make me her feel better, somehow.

She gathered together a group to go to the sunken temple. Originally to try to take care of a few tasks, but in the end, the trip ended up being about dragons. The five of them slew many dragonkin and a total of five dragons. All in all, it was very fulfilling to Alishe. For their daughter, Prydion and she had slain the beasts. And she would do it again in a heartbeat. 

And very soon, Dreamstalker would be among the corpses that she would see upon the ground. Once they regrouped and had the proper number, he was going to be destroyed. And then, she would see that portal. She would know the truth. And if her daughter did not lie beyond it, she would have to find a way to cope, but for now, she was not going to think on it. No.. for now, she was going to think about the next dragon to fall. The corruption would be ended. She would see to it.

Prydion sighed a little and kissed Alishe's shoulder, almost as he felt the churning of her mind. He squeezed her gently and whispered. ""I love you Alishe. We will be alright. We will."" Alishe smiled softly and kissed him. She nodded slowly. ""Aye, we shall. O fulo osa Dor'ano. You are and always will be the sun in my sky.""

((Thanks to Prydion, Homrend, Halton and Shadowstalkr for the great run in the temple. It was a blast! Maybe next time I'll remember my egg huh? *hehehe* And I got the kilt I wanted. Whoo! Silly vanity ftw! Now I just need to get the chestpiece and I'll be set. *hehe*

And kudos to Ultang for the group he gathered for Dreamstalker. We'll get him yet! *smiles*))"

Tonight ended very well for me and I drifted off to sleep in the arms of my beloved, feeling almost entirely.. content. Mind you, the ache for our daughter does not go away, will never go away.. but when I am with him, it dulls a little. I love him with every breath I take and every beating of my heart. I truly do.

But my dreams were restless. I heard a dragon's call and when that dragon's roar filled my mind, it almost make me retch, it hit me so hard. Ataerno was dead.. what is this madness? And in my mind filled the vision of a dragon I had seen earlier in the evening. A dragon in the hinterlands that some call Dreamtracker. A fearsome green dragon whose sneer.. whose sneer reminds me of Ataerno. 

I shudder as I write those words. Ataerno is dead. Ataerno is gone. I am free from his control and corruption. I must keep telling myself this.

That vision remains though.. and somehow, in my mind, I heard him taunt me.. calling me forth. He guards a portal to the emerald dream. I heard him tell me that our daughter lied behind him.. that if I could just get past him, I would find her there and could bring her back to us. I mustn't believe such lies. It's hard on my soul to even allow myself to think such things.

He was so convincing though. And that sneer.. that bloody sneer!! 

Oh by Elune, what has come over me. I understand this not. My mind tells me one thing and my heart tells me something else. Surely this dragon must be corrupt as well. Else why would I feel the things I do? He must be slain somehow. And mayhaps afterwards.. I can test the portal.. and see... what happens. 

No.. I must stop that thought. She is gone. I must find peace with that. 

Oh but I can't!!! I just want her back so badly. This pain never ends.....

I will go back. I will go back and I will face this dragon again. I MUST get a closer look at him... and that portal.

Dor'ano forgive me.. what I do.. I do for us. I will be as safe as I can. I swear to you. O fulo osa su alah'ni."

"event","<i>My mother's words echoed in my mind.. words I had spoken to Dor'ano just earlier tonight. And now they came back again.. 

""The sun will shine again.. the skies will clear and light will bring forth the new life once more. Darkness is a part of the cycle.. and you must embrace it. What passes.. goes away and becomes anew.

A test of faith is believing that life will gone during the darkest of times. Enduring that test.. overcoming the challenge.. is what makes us stronger.""

What do you do when you can't control what has happened to you? You control what you can. You grab on to what you can do and you focus upon it with every ounce of your strength. You find ways to make your legs move, when the last thing you want to do is stand, let alone journey on.

The world hasn't stopped. Life continues on, despite the fact that for me.. a huge part of my life has gone away. I am left feeling void, empty and useless and there is nothing for it. No one can give me comfort. No one can give me understanding. All I want is my life back. But my life will never be the same.

I... will never be the same.

I look for answers to questions that just continue to build up within my mind. And there aren't an explanations. Only more questions. More doubt. More worry. More confusion. And everything within me crying out, ""Bring her back!"". But who hears my pleas? 

They fall upon deaf ears... and all I can think is that this is what it's been like for countless others. Mayhaps in different ways than me. But the loss... it's all loss. Fathers, sons, wives, daughters, friends, lovers... all to dust. What do we fight for? More blood spills and someone else is left to cry out ""why?!"" and then what? The soil is sulled with the sweat of the fruitless and flooded with the anger of the void.

Dor'ano blames himself. I blame myself. We could do naught but tear ourselves asunder trying to lay blame where there is none. He did not do this.. nor did I. And nothing we could have done would have changed this. The ending was written before the journey ever began. I can see that now. But it doesn't mean I accept it.

I feel angry. I feel bitter and I want.. revenge. How do I get that? Ataerno is no more. His corruption claimed my child as it almost claimed me. I want this pain to subside, but every breath brings more with it. There is no peace. There is no calm.. there is only the vast space of emptiness where there was once a delicate flower in the soil.

Where is Elune now? When my heart is torn to bits... Where is the faith I once held fast to? It died with a great dragon. His blood remains upon me.. and I cannot come clean of it. And the more I think of his kind.. the more my bitterness grows.</i>

Alishe stayed with Prydion until his breathing settled into that of slumber. She brushed the hair from his eyes and sighed deeply, tears flooding down her cheeks. She had let him down. She had failed him. She kissed his cheek and whispered, ""O fulo osa Dor'ano"" as she slowly left his side. Around the crater she traveled.. aimlessly wandering. If she could not do anything else, she would collect crystals for him. At least she was doing.. something.. that way."

This is a highly emotional storyline, especially for me having gone through it myself.. although of course, my situation was a bit different from Alishe. However, the emotions are there.

"event","Alishe blinked as Rendane's last words echoed in her mind. <i>""Alishe... the baby is gone.</i> She shook her head as if she was trying to clear her mind and make the words disappear. Then she shook her head at the thought that Rendane was right. For two days, she'd been in limbo, wondering if her worst fear was a reality. She had thought she felt something when Ataerno hit the ground, but tried to convinced herself that it was only fatigue. <i>""No... No. You are wrong Rendane. You have to be wrong. Tell me the corruption is still there. Tell me that killing Ataerno failed to free me, but.. DO NOT.. tell me that our child is gone!""</i>

Rendane sighed and offered Alishe a seat next to her. <i>""Sweet spirit, the last thing I wish to do is hurt you. But you must face it. Deep within, you know I speak the truth. You've felt it. Even Prydion has felt it, but he tried to push it away as you are now.""</i> Rendane offered a hand to Alishe, who only took a step back, not wanting the contact. Rendane sighed again, looking over Alishe with sympathy and compassion. 

<i>""I am very sorry Alishe. More than I can say. But when the corruption was taken from your body. Somehow... it took your child with it. I cannot explain it. But apparently..""</i> Rendane paused. <i>Apparently... It was not time for your child to be brought into this world. But do not give up hope, sweet spirit. Remember what Elune showed you. A vision like that is given for a reason. Perhaps it was to give you hope as you endure what you are now.""</i>

A flash of anger appeared in Alishe's eyes and she glared at Rendane. <i>""So, this is Elune's will? Elune shows me our daughter.. playing happily with Dor'ano and then takes her from me? How cruel!! This was our dream Rendane! You have no idea how much we have put into this... How much this has meant.. to me. And Dor'ano, this is one of his deepest desires. A family...""</i> Tears began to stream down Alishe's cheeks. <i>""Now you tell me that she is gone. You cannot tell me why. You ask me to accept it as Elune's will and to make my peace with it. Well... I CANNOT! I want my baby back Rendane. I don't care what I have to go through. Tell me how to get my child back!""</i>

Her eyes were soft and gentle as Rendane looked upon Alishe. She stood slowly and walked forward, placing her hands upon Alishe's shoulders. <i>""Alishe. It is done. It cannot be undone. Nature has taken it's course. Your time will come again. But it is not now. For now...""</i> Rendane tipped up Alishe's chin to look upon her as more tears filled Alishe's eyes and flowed down her cheeks. <i>""For now.. You and Prydion must find peace with this.. somehow. You must join together and be strength for one another. You must stop this silly bickering and hold tightly to one another. Only then can you heal. Only then can you continue on.""</i>

Alishe jerked out of reach, turned her back and began to walk away, not wanting to hear another word. She paused only long enough to whisper. <i>""I cannot accept this. I will not. And I will not be the one to tell Dor'ano. You dropped this news upon me. You can do the same with him. Do not make me carry this burden. I have.. enough.""</i> Rendane nodded, though Alishe could not see it. Alishe then kept walking, desperate to make her way to her special place in the glade. She knew she would not find peace there this day, but she didn't know where else to go.

Prydion turned in his sleep and woke to find that Alishe had not been to bed all night. He sighed deeply, fretting about her. She was more stubborn than he was at times. He frowned as he realized that he must rest a bit more before going to find her. He said a silent prayer to the light for her and for their unborn daughter and then closed his eyes, feeling distinctly unsettled. And in his dreams, a tauren druidess approached him slowly, a heaviness etched across her face as she greeted him gently.

<i>""Greetings Paladin of the light. I am Rendane Brightfeather. We have important matters to speak of. Before I say anything more, remember this. Alishe loves you as you love her. You are joined together in a bond that is stronger than most can dare to touch. Do not lose sight of that in whatever you feel when I finish my words.""</i>"

"event","Alishe woke early to the sound of leaves rustling in the wind. She was careful not to wake Prydion, who still slumbered deeply beside her. No doubt he was exhausted from their fighting the night before. Ataerno had been found. He had been bested and slain. 

Strangely, the dragon had no real final words for her as it happened. She could only ponder that he had not expected her to be able to pull this together as she had. Deep down, part of her felt robbed of some closure, only having the memory of his broken body lying upon the ground to ease her troubled mind. 

What did she expect him to say? ""Oh hello, nice to see you Alishe.. come here to kill me?"" Right. Alishe sighed as she pulled on her daytime robe. She felt so numb, she couldn't explain it. She didn't want to drink. She didn't want to eat. She truthfully did not want to sleep, but he was insistent that she try. Everyone was fretting over her after the raid was over. Wanting to know she was well. Wanting to her to eat something for the sake of her child. But Alishe just felt.. void.

She slipped on her sandals and ran down the path toward Rendane's quarters. She needed desperately to speak with her mentor. Rendane had to know something. Alishe needed answers. She needed affirmation that all was well. Something.. anything.. to make this nagging leave her mind.

But when Alishe arrived, she was greeted by a guard who told her that Rendane was not accepting visitors at that time. Alishe just stared blankly at him. ""You don't understand... I NEED to speak to Rendane. It's urgent."" The guard stood firm and told her that she would just have to come back. She refused to accept this. ""I'm not leaving until I see her. You and I can stand right here and have a stare down for all I care. I am... not.. leaving this spot. Do you understand me?"" The guard frowned at her. ""Druid, you are disrespecting her space. Cease this and go on your way. She will contact you when she is able.""

Alishe's eyes began to fill with frustrated tears. She needed Rendane. She really needed her. Her shoulder's slumped and she sighed heavily. In a very soft voice she whispered, ""You are right. I've forgotten my place and I apologize."" With that, she turned and began to walk down the path back to Prydion, the numbness beginning to take hold again. Then Alishe heard Rendane's voice in her mind.

<i>""Sweet spirit, I apologize. I have important matters I must attend presently. I wish you to take rest and replenish yourself. Hold tight to your husband, Alishe. You will both need each other's strength.""</i> And just like that, her voice was gone. Alishe bit her lip and took a soft breath before beginning the journey again.

He was the only thing that made her feel anything right now. And she needed him terribly. She still had no idea if things were going to be ok, but she could only hope that no matter what, he would always be there. She made her way back to their room and sat silently upon the bed. Her eyes taking him in as her hand reached out to brush his hair back from his face. ""My Dor'ano"" She thought to herself as he slowly opened his eyes to look upon her. His hand reached out to grasp hers and he smiled very faintly. He turned and brushed his free hand against her cheek. ""My Ishura"" he whispered to her, his voice sill a bit cracked from having just woken up. She leaned against his hand and sighed softly.

They had each other. They would always have each other. And as long as she focused on that, had faith in that, she would be alright. No matter what would come. She laid down next to him, snuggling up to him as he wrapped his arms around her tightly. She closed her eyes and just held to him. His strength was hers. Her strength was his and though it was two who laid in the bed together, they were one spirit. Uthas had been right. They were seamlessly joined. Bonded deeply and nothing would sunder it."

"event","<i>Dear Diary,

Tonight.. we slew the dragon I know as Ataerno. 

He reappeared in the blasted lands and before I could take more than a few breaths, I had a force of over 15 souls.. more than that, but I cannot recall right now.. who were armed and at the ready. Pathis was my champion. Pathis who has put himself before me in the horrid place of Dire Maul.. he is who slew my dragon. And I owe him.. and the others who aided.. much.

I fell to my knees when the dragon crumpled to the ground, overcome with emotion and unable to stop the tears from falling. Everyone looked at me when it was over, for some sign that all was well, but I could not and cannot give it. I know not. I don't feel any different. No big changes happened. No miracles that I could sense. But then again, I did not feel cursed all these years, so what do I expect?

I spent quiet time with my Dor'ano at moonglade, in my special place. Mainly he just held me as I tried to find my wits again. I feel.. out of sorts. Truth be told the worst of it is just a severe lack of hunger... though I know not what that means. 

Oh.. and my scar.. is gone. 

We shall rest in moonglade tonight.. and I will speak to Rendane in the morning. Mayhaps she will have something to say. Mayhaps she will know if all is well. I feel this nagging ache that it is not.. and that worries me.. deeply.</i>

((What a HUGE raid this was!! I got overwhelmed with the amount of help that came pouring in so soon. Damn that dragon for suddenly reappearing again. Last minute decision led to my ""sisters"" not being able to be there. *frown* Apologies to Aurora and Cheriss.. I wanted you there!!!

Prydion, Homrend, Rhel, Keltarin, Chelody, Tarquin, Ceil, Zem, Pathis, Ultang, Hinote and there were so many boomsticks there.. I really wish I could remember all of their names! Thank you all for doing this. It was a bit of a turnabout for me to switch gears... and I kind of got stuck doing it, but with the encouragement of those closest to me, it went well I think. Hopefully everyone had fun.

I only managed to get two raid pics.. so if someone has more.. PLEASE share!!

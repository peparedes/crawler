Well haha i thought this was hilarious, my mom saw a guy laying in front of our door step and she called police haha Well you can see him from my bedroom window and i couldnt help but to stare and wait till the police came, he had a nice samsung cell phone and you can hear him sobbing lol the police told my dad to poke him and see if he was alive haha and my dad told them that their crazy and they should hurry over. Well the police was talking with him, and then he walked off. Exciting is it not? I thought it was funny, i couldnt stop laughing when i told my sister."

"event","It wasnt what i expected today. It started off as a boring day and everything, then after school we went to go chill and have a chat with my english teacher, O'donald. After that we left to go to the plaza and sit and chat with few of my friends. Lets cut to the chase? Im TRAUMATIZED! Talking to my friends then turning around to a ""Oooh"" and seeing my friend Sam scrapping it out with a girl named Lani. I mean ""Go Sam!"" Seeing her pinning Lani down to the ground, a old looking lady comes up and yells ""Get Off!"" I can see Lani running away down the hall, me and my friends go up to Sam asking her if shes okay and everything and she says ""I can feel blood"" but when me and my friends looked there was nothing on her, until she turned around with blood dripping all over her back, i mean it looks disgusting then she waves her hair around and i lifted it up for her and there it was, a stab, so deep that i can see her meet and so deep it looks like a canyon on her back. My friend Diana yells ""Go to the office quick!"" I held up her hair and started walking real fast to the office, then we started running, i can see in the corner of my eye Diana running. We walked to the office door banging like crazy, and there was my english teacher, O'donald! He rushed her in the nurses room and told us to wait outside. My legs are shaking and i feel ill. I look down at my hand and there it is, her blood on my fingers, i soon asked my friend to come with me to the washroom so i can wash up.

I went home and find that the electricty was off, i remember the schools going off too, so great. I sit in the dark talking to my cousin on the phone and sees a police car driving by and stopping infront of my town house, there he goes walking out and starts to walk towards my door. I didnt open it cause i didnt hear a knock. But they called me soon after, like an hour or so and asked me questions. I couldnt help but shake and studder and say ""Sorry"" they said they'll call me back. Im still waiting for the call."

There she is laying on the ground, a red river flowing out of her head, as for me i cant stop hearing echos of screams. Why would this ever happen?

We're sitting in the car, waiting to pick up my mom and there she is, with a smile about to hop into the passenger seat. And then it happened, the unthinkable. As she opened the door, a car comes slamming into my mother. I hear an aching scream. A gasp from my father, a scream from my sister, and silence coming out of me. My eyes grew big and i cannot believe what i just saw. My mom on the ground. Im panting, and i cant stop this. I know i can, but its not working. This is what kept me sleeping for hours. The families troubles are just beginning. I can hear the yelling, the screams, the cries. Oh help me and lock me in a room.

I feel a sudden shake on my leg, and a wake up to see my dad. ""Wake up, Tri."" As i lay in bed, the blue coated room. Im sweating, im breathing hard. I cannot believe what happened in my dream. Death is not what i would want to dream about. This hasnt happened the first time. Wierd but true, I had dreams where i was murdered by my dad, my parents were killed, my sister was gone. I dont know what it means.

This is it. I didnt sleep to this dream, it just drastically changed. It wasnt pretty, it wasnt kind, it wasnt nice."

An atmosphere like this, of course i have to listen to my piano music. Something to soften the mood. Sitting here listening to Mozart, and the creepy song 'Moonlight Sonata.' I like it this way.

But on the way there it has to be the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me throughout the whole trip, I saw a million stars but not only that, I saw the northern lights! Im not sure if everyone knows what it is but its like a wave of light in the sky, you know what im saying? After that we stayed there till five, and three of us never slept.

So we came back to Calgary early, so we went to go eat at Dennys because my cousin and her friend got hungry. We sat there for about an half an hour or two i guess. Then they drove me to the airport then finally the plane took flight.

Im back at home, and it feels wonderful, nothing is as good as home sweet home. My dad came to pick me up at the Abbotsford airport, then drove me home. I couldnt stop smiling when i walked into the house, i cant believe how much i miss this house. I miss my dog. I miss my sister. I miss my rents. I come in my room and theres a present sitting on my bed. A white rectangle box wrapped in a clear winnie the pooh wrapping paper and it said <i>""2 S T E V E N""</i>, it was from my sister! Feels good to come home to a present too. Well i guess im a year older, and i can finally say im fifteen. <i>Happy Birthday to me</i> =)"

After we went to the little town called Banff it was cute. Small little town. Alot of tourist goes there. But all well i had a meal in the mall.

After all that walking in the heat, we went to a hot spring. It was great actually, got all my stuff changed into shorts, got locker twentyseven. And sat in the hot spring for a half an hour. Felt good, there was alot of people. It looked like a big swimming pool but it was all warm and stuff. Too many old people making it out, its sweet and all but not in public it looked odd. Im sorry but in the changing room/locker room... I do not enjoy old caucasian men, walking around in the nude and letting it hang loose."

The sun is shining, the clouds have gone and flew, birds chirping going down south, the coldness of the air, the frost that seems to lay a blanket over the grass seems to pierce a glow into the morning. The cold morning air, each time i breathe i blow out a cloud of warmth that cools into the morning air. I walk down the street with my hands in my pocket, scarf wrapped around my neck, my black shoes gain a pound onto the cement ground each time i take a step. I think about things that have been roaming inside my head for awhile. Its been three months since i have last seen you, and i still think about those times. I walk up 106th Avenue and think, ""Why am i still waiting for you, when i really know your never going to call back."" This is when i begin my new journey in life. I have once stepped into the past but now i will reach for my future and whats beyond me. Where does life begin? Where do i begin? I search and i reach... and i tell myself.

The sun is behind me setting, quarter up in the sky, the yellow goldish blend into the blue seems to make a sparkle onto the wet cement ground. I seem to remember surpass memories of times when i had a smile i never had before, and a light in my heart that never seemed to shine before. Always remembering those times of precious moments that need to be forgotten. I hear a kaw above and look at the sky, the first crow seems to be leading the rest into a flawk of heavenly birds across the skies, i see them, millions of them flying over head, i watch and walk at the same time, no sound around me, just the birds flapping. I think to myself, ""I wish i can be free like a bird."" I wanna be free, to flap my wings across the sky, looking whats below me, feeling the air push against me, and sweep through the breeze. If only humans can fly and reach to the sky, just with a touch of the tip of their fingers. Still flying above me, i watch till the last one flys over head, i thought... ""that must be me, the very last one, after all i havent been trying my best to do anything, why? I dont know why.""  But then i have done what i can and i cant be the last, cause no one is the last. There is no finish to anything. The water dew of the rain drips off the green grass... i walk. i walk on one 'o' fifth avenue. This is where i walk. Today and probaly tomorrow... where does this road lead me? To another street of course, just like the course of life. I take a turn on the gravelled stone walkway, and dangle the keys in my hand. I take the keys, open the door, and take a step into my jail. My cage. My box. I want to be free, for just one day."

Busy as you are, im amazed you even called. I said yes. I remember i wore my white jean shorts. On a day like this why would i wanna hide my untanned legs that need to be tanned. And so we drove off.

Same routine as always, but it was something i couldnt get bored of. Same flavour as always. I decided to get coconut icecream and cookies'n'cream, my fave. Sitting on that wooden bench, picking at my icecream with my spoon. You asked me if i wanted some of yours, ""just a little taste would be okay."" It was chocolate chip mint, not my favourite, but its alrighht once in a while. We stayed qite along time at the beach as i can remember. Till sunset thats when we left. We went somewhere else. I can remember every single thing. But that is left unsaid.

You drove me home. I had a little nap. You dropped me off and i opened the door, ""I'll see you tomorrow."" you said. I told you to call me then, and smiled and shut the door.

We drive up north. Its the season where all those little cotton balls start to fly all over the sky and then landing on the ground, covering the earth making it look like a summer snow. We get there and you introduce me to many. We start eating and stuff but he's also in here. In the same room as me. I feel as if i need to leave. So with my plate of food, i go outside and sit on the curb. I sat eating there for quite some bit... but decided to stay, not wanting to go in.

You come out looking for me, calling my name. And there i was, sitting alone, with a empty plate beside me piled with bones. I feel your presence but i dont say a word. You made yourself comfy right next to me asking me, ""whats wrong"". I look with blank eyes with no words to answer. ""You know, iI can almost say its been a year since i known you, what do you think? Its almost the twentyseventh and i can almost say im fourteen. Can you believe it? I know its just a few days away but i just cant wait."" You look at me and smiled. ""Lets go in."" And so we did."

I answered. And i couldnt believe it. My started to pound fast. I was losing breath. Every word i tried to say i started to studder. I couldnt help myself. Today was very unexpected. I dont know... but i guess i should just leave the story to myself. Even though i just mentioned it.

But this was wierd. You inacted as if you saw me yesterday. But i am sure that you relized it was a year. I wasnt happy. Yet i wasnt disappointed or mad. But i guess no one understood me. Of course i would be a bit mad... but i guess i am that easily to take advantage of. Im different now. Im stronger than before, that i can be sure of. Maybe not all strong, but im not that weak either.

"event","Nothing but the dark. The dark. Im just laying there on the floor. Staring at my ceiling. My door is open just a bit. Just a bit to let some light in from the hallway. I stare in blank, listening to my cd player. Nothing. I feel so relaxed. Its nearly four twentyfive AM... its near bed time. I can see light, seaping through the blinds. Do you see what i see? I stand up and walk towards my window, and pulls the blinds up. I can see the daylight starting to rise. Sun rise. Its almost a calming feeling. I can hear the birds chirping to the morning light. I stare with empty eyes. I open my window, and pull my blinds down. And make my way to my bed.

"event","Opening up my eyes to a bright room, i notice that its one thirty. My door is closed and i hear the two girls chit chatting. Opening the blinds and releasing the warm air through, i close the blinds only half way. Brushed my teeth, turn on my VCR and watch paris by night. I have absolutly no plans today. Only to clean.

After eating my sunny side up eggs, spam ham, and toasted bread... it was my so called lunch/breakfast, i tire myself out by cleaning the house. What i would do for ten bucks. Im broke so i might as well work for that ten bucks. Took me half an hour just to clean my room, clean out my school bags, wipe the dust off, vacuum the stairs, cleaning the washroom. Off to a sweaty start.

The phone rings and i pick it up. Its Nga, my oh my, she asked me to watch Charlies Angels: Full Throttle. ""We'll meet up at six at silver city."", ""Okay."" Off i go into the shower, washing off the sweat. My current washroom song Game over by BabyVOX. I put it on repeat. Got dressed, did my hair, off i go!

I finally got there and paid for my ticket and everything. They were waiting inside. We got our seats and everything, it took the movie so long to start. We got the old side of the theatres... knowing how low the seats are and how it isnt as comfy as the new ones. In the middle of the movie, where lucy, drew, and cameron got shot, it seemed to be so hilarious. They got shot and next thing you know their laying there on a patch of green grass lying in a row. It seemed so ridiculous that me and my friend started laughing. It was so quiet and you can hear me and my friend snickering away. It was funny. Alot of action scenes but the movie wasnt all great.

"event","Nothing like the sun outside, small little cotton of clouds floating about. I got dressed and ready to go jog. Its a jog right, so wear whatever. Blue shorts, blue tommy t-shirt, popped on some socks, slipped my shoes on and got out.

Im heading to the park to meet up with my friend whos going to jog with me. Feels great to be outside in the sun. I look at my legs. I look at it with disgust. ""Why are they so pale?"" I ask myself. So anyways it took me so long to get there that i saw my friend walk half way down the street where i was walking up.

We finally get the park. Do our stretches, and do whatever we need to and start jogging off onto the trail. Im jogging and trying to talk and the same time. Its not helping my breathing... we jog all around the trail and i feel like im running ahead. We stop to do more stretches because my friend had a cramp. She says i jog too fast. I chuckle and say i dont. So instead of jogging back to the field, we just walked it and talked. We find a nice green patch where the sun didnt burnt the poor grass, and sat ourselves down. I myself was doing the listening and trying to tan my ugly pale legs, and try to tan my arms... its gross to have a farmers tan... and i have it. All well i was too busy trying to tan my leg. Just lying there feeling relaxed. Feeling the heat of the sun... still listening to my friend talk.

After all that sitting and laying. We ended up going to the water park and running around in the water. Wow i look at my legs and my legs seemed to look darker. Thank god i got a small little tan. Good enough i think. We swung on the swings. We slid down the slide. Good day, good day.

"event","As i stare out the window. I wonder if i could ever see the light without seeing the dark. It has nearly been a year. Seems like yesterday when i saw the light in my eyes. I am trapped in my own secret.

As i took flight into the air, soaring about. The sun is at its peak, so the sky seem to look like an exploding grapefruit. The soft clouds are rushing by me as i spread my wings and fly. Is this how it feels like to be free? Is this it feels like to do anything i want? Is this how it is? I took flight and now i plunge myself to jail. Im going down faster. Im breathing harder. The wind is stealing my breath away.

I tried looking away. But i always ended up looking back. I tried. I really did. I tried looking away, but i always ended up looking back. I wondered... if you ever looked back. You made me look weak and foolish in many ways.

Smiles can be illusions. I try and i try. I havent had a true smile for such a long time. Maybe i longed for it. Maybe i craved for a smile that is true, like how i crave for honeydew. If this is not true. then dont believe it. I show you nothing but the truth.

Its not so pleasant but this is what i have to face, if i want to make it home. Walking down the street i feel every heat burning my skin to crisp. The air is dry. My body feels gross. My neck feels sticky. I need to get out of this heat. I'm nearly home and i cant wait. Why wont someone offer me a ride. This retched heat. I think i will fall to great distinct. I finally make it to my house. The warmth is unbearable but it will have to do. I turn on the shower. And refresh myself.

I slowed down and walked myself up the street. I didnt care if i got a bad time or not, Im tired and its the last block. So i come back and sad as it is, my time was fifteen thirty-five. Thats alright i tried my best.

We got out on the hockey court. Just playing as usual. And so this guy on my team tells me that the end of his hockey stick is loose, i told him to trade with me, but he insisted not to. So i said ""suit yourself."" Playing normally, then few minutes later, he takes a slap shot...

This is happening way to fast, i couldnt react. Everything is speeding up, i can see streaks, i turn my face. I couldnt react fast enough everything was zooming buy. SLAM. My hands are placed on my cheek. My face is in pain. ""You idiot!"" I yelled. Teacher said i'll be alright, i said yeah ""i will be alright."" My face has a bump, and it hurts.

But this time i thought i was free from those memories. But i guess not. Once again you caught me as a slave. How many times have i asked you to go away. There is no need for you, trying name names. Dont talk to me as if im no one. I am someone. I have a small voice but i am heard. You lied, and told me i could be free. I am not a slave for anyone. Not even for you. So why dont you stop bringing back my memories and back off? Because i believe i can stand strong. I believe that i can move on.

Theres nothing worse then the heat of the sun when you're having p.e., never the less you have to run early in the morning. He takes off with the glide of people, running straight then turning to his right. He jogs ahead of everyone else. Not even half way down the street he huffs and he puffs. His legs are tensing up like before, and its slowing his speed down. He tries his best to make it ahead of the three people. He doesnt dare run on the side walk. It hurts his feet. So he runs on the street where no one get's in his way. Hes slowing down, his friend speeds right past him. ""Never."" he says, he speeds up his jog to catch up to his friend. Already turning around the corner, his feet burns like fire. His legs are tense and he think's he cant make it. The race is on. Both friends try to speed off. Hes nearly there, he can see where he has to finish. Run straight. Run forward. Breathe in. Breathe out. Hes catching up, he runs ahead. Five-twentyfive. That was my time.

I sit here, on the floor, with the paint brush in one hand. Sitting there and listening to Park hwa yo bi. Her music, makes me visualize. Her soft and raspy voice singing. What i feel is what i express into colours. Drawing away on white paper, not knowing what to paint. Stroking the brush with plenty of colours. The girl i drew looks like a skank. I paint and stroke the colours of blue and black for her shirt. Her dress in plenty of colours of pink, yellow, red and a touch of green. What am i doing? I walk over to the sink and turn on the tap. I slowly run my painting in the water. Crumpled the soft painted paper. Threw it away in the garbage.

This is what i want to draw. This is what i cant draw. So i dipped the brush in paint and smudged it in the black. One stroke, after another. There was her eye. Bringing down the paint. Giving her that long slender nose. Giving her the smile that everyone longs to see. Cleaning the black away, and replacing purple in its place. There goes her eye shadow. There is her lipstick. The flowers are what she wants.

"event","omg....it has been a really long time since the last time i wrote in my journal. so got a lot to say to you know catCh up! so here are the general topics::
friends: not in any fights with friends ... at all this year! thats great but there to help my friends when they may have had a few bumps in the road
guys: still remained their crazy self..which is fine by me! as for liking any more than friends think that is over for a while for many reasons...why bother gettign your heart broken so many times or waste the time to..and friends usually overall last longer than having a boyfriend...but for my friends who like someone who have a boyfriend way to go! lol
school: last day of classes was friday and for the next two weeks just have exams
work: still working at the regal cinemas and enjoy it a lot i am going to get a raise though soon so i am excited but unfortantely i keep being put on this one position i dont like at all its called regal crown clun were you have to go up to all the people and ask them if they would like to sign up (its free and you earn points for free food at concession stand and tickets and the box office) so why wouldnt ppl?! i dont get that part but whatever
lessons for the sax is all over but the best news is i got a 98 on my nyssma solo the best i have ever done adn it was a level six and i got sick before i performed i mean i was really sick before i walked in the room..but cassis and peter and james and jordan were outside the room with me thanks! and then when i was done i went back up to the third floor to finish my registration shift (nyssma was at cleve hill so i volunteered to help out six hours and it wasnt that boring especially since sarah came which made it a lot of fun and she was so excited when i got a 98 and she was like ""i dont know what any of this means but i am so happy for you"") lol and then there was ben who was a funny kid that sarah was talking to and she was getting really good at her job and learned what a woodwind and brass insturement are.
dance: today was my last dance day had my recital and my mom derek and sarah came i think and hope! sarah enjoyed it hope she liked my act ofcourse i only danced once but for once i actually liked out costumes~ it was amazing. but omg the magician who was there doing little acts inbetween some dances was freakin sweet and i know for a fact sarah liked him it was so cool what he did! like unbelievable i love magic! after my dance recital we went to olive garden adn omg sarah has a comment for everything but i still love her! she is the best friend i girl could ever ask for
random: on thursday rachel natalie and I decorated sarahs locker she was so happy and shocked then i baked her a cake that was apparently really good lol and i gave her this huge ass card that took me forever to make! sorry doll i am gonna miss your birthday but i am brainstorming something big for you to do before i leave or when i come back to surprise you and i mean BIG!! something you wouldnt ever expect to get! there are so many birthdays i am missing (with my friends) and i feel so bad...but lov ya all and happy birthday lol.  oh and josh thanks for the invite to come to your house to go swimming and sorry i didnt come but there are reasons that i cant really explain or dont really want to ... hope i dont miss the next time just call me since you now have my seven numbers! well thats all i can really think of except my life as a sophomore is like over and i will be a junior soon O MY worD!! there is prom then and more classes to take that i will just want to scream...but as for prom i dont think that is happening next year, but see when the time comes
well i am outty
much love all around

song lyrics that mean something::

Can't you see?
There's a feeling that's come over me
Close my eyes
You're the only one that leaves me completely breathless
No need to wonder why
Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny
'Cause I wanted to fly,
so you gave me your wings
And time held its breath so I could see, yeah
And you set me free
There's a will
There's a way
Sometimes words just can't explain
This is real
I'm afraid. stlyrics
I guess this time there's just no hiding, fighting
You make me restless
You're in my heart
The only light that shines
there in the dark
When I was alone
You came around
When I was down
You pulled me through
And there's nothing that
I wouldn't do for you
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
When I look in your eyes
I see a whole different sky
Like I've never seen before
And when I hear your voice
It's like a song that I can
Listen to o', over again
It's so crazy how you make me go crazy
Every time that I'm near you
Cause you're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
You're just a dream
Just a dream
When I picture the world
It takes me to the sun
I think about the way you smile
And the words that you say
Always seem to change
The world that I've been living in
It's so crazy how you make me go crazy
Every time that I'm near you
Cause you're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
You're just a dream
Just a dream
You're just a dream
Just a dream yeah
More than my imagination could ever see
You're just a dream
If I could be with you
You're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
Cause You're just a dream
This is my reality
Totally insanity
If I could be in your dream
All I wanna do is be with you be with you
Be with you
You're just a dream
Oh whoa you're just a dream
Just a dream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Everyday, I look around
Seems that no one's ever satisfied
Could it be, that underneath
We've all got something to hide?
From the moment we arrive
We want to fill the space inside
We all need to feel alive
If it's love that keeps us breathin'
Gives us something to believe in
Is it fear that makes us blind?
Tell me, why is love so hard to find?
If we hear so much about it
Let the mystery unwind
Tell me, why is love so hard to find?
All I know is when you find it
Even earth can feel like you're in heaven
Tell me know, unlock the secret
Help us all to find the hidden treasure
From the moment we arrive
We want to fill the space inside
We all need to feel alive
Don't you know I'm never gonna give up
'Til I find the love?
I'll be searchin' the whole world over
To find my love...
<3 those are my song lyrics dont really have anything to say but I almost told the one i liked how i feel for him that would have been a mistake....riGhT??

"event","HEY!!! im back kinda a dragful day but the weekend was great particularly friday! it was the best dance ever! before the dance i went to cournteys to get ready and go with her and thats were all the magic began lol....i got a makeover....courtney gave me this reaLLy cute top to wear and a chocker and then joleena did my hair..it was hot lol jk.... then joleena courtney and i went to the dance...started off like usual dances not much dancing lol then courtney was with her boyfriend and joleena was around and for once i didnt feel like me a follower so i danced in the back with like lauren! kathy! meg! jeff james jordan ryan ! and i actually danced like the whole time i only went to the cafeteria twice to get a drink and because i was really tired! but i had a great time...besides dancing like with the group of people i danced with jeff C. scotty! joshUa & lucas~~i got to see luke!! AAAHHH lol courtney and i were just a little bit hyper<> then when the band was playing josh and i were acting like we were drunk it was funny and when erin came over josh was really trYinG to be believable lol.....and you know the best part only thought of someone******* (random stars) twice because i wasnt doing anything...yep those would be the two times i was in the cafeteria<> and what was up with all the people who were actually drunk i def do not like seeing ppl get sick but as long as it wasnt on me i guess it was okay to seat there for a little support ...for like 5 seconds but i mostly just talked to courtney and nick than...ONE MONTH and one day!!! CongRAts guys!! but i think the GAA should hold another dance it was great...except for the fact that everytime i turned around the same guy was there or maybe that was just a cawincedinc* (how the hell do you spell that word)but ill just think that it was an awkward event....lol.......than there is always this one guy you want to dance with but you just never asked him either because he was two busy (which he was lol) EEEWWW and than like i told him that and now i think he got the wrong impression DEF NOT!!! only friend thats all! just wanted to dance with you because you ARE my friend oh well...overall like the 6th millionth time i had like the best never ever so many complimants on my hair and shirt thanks courntey and joleena....its all due to you guys <3 ya both sO muCh!! xOXoxOXo
saturday i went bowling 10pm to 12am for band i got a 111 and i 193!!! oh yea look who can bowl now lol....havent bowled in like 4years! it was fun i got to hang with lauren again!! having those talks are great and than kathy every moment with kathy is never a dull moment those are the kinda ppl i luv hanging with just like my doll..........

feelings twisted dont know do i really like you? you dont talk to me much at all... and you act weird/awakward/ different around me....why? got another guy liked for about 2-3 years but we are only friends so i know how that one feels  ""just like you as a friend"" and like i say to my friends i will say to myself... better friends than nothing....someone new is in my life dont know who he likes though but he always makes me laugh...and j.c. dont worry about getting ""the one"" we are in high school and you got time....you may in a year or so fall for someone else that likes you too adn you will be crazy for her that will be the time you always will shine!  but for now you are so funny/cute when you talking about the girl you like lol...you really have to edit that profile of yours tho simmer it down a bit..justin dude, friend, buddy, who do you like?????

you can see the life you can see the light but you can never be by your self
once you have friends you are ALways stuck with those friends
and for to have that luck is like life is complete
where can you go what can you do when no one else is there for you?
you always have those back up people those people who are only there for you in the good times but there are the those Friends you have that walk by your side through bad times 
they don't seat out on the sidelines, when the time is rough
they don't just watch you stumble through the mud 
they give you confidence they give light they let you shine so bright on every step you take
but don't hide your feelings, don't you give up on me because for one reason i will never let you down i will never let you fall to the ground i got your back and i trust that you have mine too do i have those friends...... well truth be told it lies in YOU!




""Love Will Find a Way"" 
 
          In a perfect world 
One we've never known 
We would never need to face the world alone 

They can have the world 
We'll create our own 
I may not be brave or strong or smart 
But somewhere in my secret heart 

I know 
Love will find a way 
Anywhere I go 
I'm home 
If you are there beside me 

Like dark turning into day 
Somehow we'll come through 
Now that I've found you 
Love will find a way 

I was so afraid 
Now I realize 
Love is never wrong 
And so it never dies 

There's a perfect world 
Shining in your eyes 
And if only they could feel it too 
The happiness I feel with you 

They'd know 
Love will find a way 
Anywhere we go 
We're home 
If we are there together 

Like dark turning into day 
Somehow we'll come through 
Now that I've found you 
Love will find a way 

I know love will find a way 



hey crista! whats goin on? i had to write u cuz im so bored and theres like people online but no ones sayin hi to me lol i'm always IM'ing people first i hate that lol soooo what are u doing? man im so bored i think i could die and ur prolly gettin bored just from reading this but too bad im gunna keep writing so newho im watching boy meets world right now dont u just love that show lol~ soooo u have some competition tomorrow or sometihng i cant remember the exact word you said but good luck and if your home frm the thing already well then im sure u did great lol ummm lets see what else is there to say oh yeah thanks for sharing ur probs with me lol i always like 2 help out if i can..did i ? lol well maybe not that much but i try! lets see....man remember that hairy guy today and the meet? lol planet of the apes?
......i still think you should tell him tho get it off ur chest!
(from my doll! geez i sure luv that girl~~im sorry hunnie i just cant its too hard for me to tell him i hope your not disappointed in me:( lol)

If i could see you tonight
It would be a dream in a fantasy
I never thought i could have been with someone like you
I just want to see you laugh to see your smile everyday!
Never ever want to see you cry 
dont want to see those tears in your eyes
If i could make everything better wouldnt you think i would
but i try so hard to talk to you, to make you all better
sometimes works sometimes just need to be by yourself
thats when i realize i realize though that I .. me cant be by myself because to solve my
problems I need to see you and they all disappear.


When you feel something ........ something of a shock, an excitment 
that excitment being created in just one day, possibly from just one word
can and could possibly be the best feeling in the world.
For when this day comes to the people who are waiting, you will have to stop a second and just think ....wow that , that actually happened,                       happened to me!  I will never forget that day, the day it happened to me and I guarantee you, you will never forget the most littlest things because most of the time those are the most spectacular unforgetable moments.
><><><><><><><><><><>

hey hey hey!!! well lets start with yesterday. it definately wasnt one of my greatest days or anything. some friends were being shitty towards me (there will be no names of jerks in here.... so dont worry about it only the best ones!) some people bother me so much! they only talk to me in school or when they only need something from me
but do they listen to me when i need them.... do they become a true friend over the summer or over the break or even over the weekend by calling me and asking me do you want to do something..... right now at this very moment i think i got only two TWO wonderful spectacular true friends HABS and my doll luv ya guys thanks for including me thanks for being a great theE best friends!

today was kinda shitty to because my dad had a doctors appointment and he found out something terribly!  he has a whole in his heart. that just broke mine. i mean me and my dad dont get a long but he is still my crazy gorilla dad that i love.  the worst part is that is how my sister (older) her name was/is jessica eve she was only two years old when she passed away. and i was in my mom so i never got to meet her she never got to see me
but i believe she is in heaven and she is being my guardian angel. when something happens when i quickly look well i am already crossing the street because i didnt see a car but then suddenly one appears and i run across. or when i am about to fall but only lose my balance. when i feel like all else has failed. when i cant see the light at the end. when i thought i have cried so much i will never stop. i think of a ballerina two years old my beautiful sister who inspires me everyday to be the best i can in everything i do. to never my cruel to anyone and luv all my friends and family! to all my girl friends i luv ya!! nicole(six years they have certainly been the best ""six years ago i unwrapped the best gift"" you are so sweet nice funny kind generous stupid at times but thats what makes the memories you and me together being stupid at the same time wow those are the days, sleep overs ""studying"" then actually studying you really are learning on how to tpye faster to im so proud of you. there is so much to say about you i dont know where to begin and end and i am getting really tired now so another day i will get back to you if i remember but i luv ya you are the bestest! sarah MY DOLL geez you make me laugh more than anyone else i know i can never stop and dont worry i am laughing with you not at you unlike some people and i think jack does like! and ignore josh with the whole good charolette critism and ruining your pictures that sure is josh lol thanks for always listening to me and i cant believe we like the same person or liked but i still think you still like him! dont ""hide your feelings"" ""get it off your chest"" thanks for all your advice you truly do help me and i dont think i could ever get mad at you who could get made at the lovely face of yours lol :) autumn so many memories wow courtney erin (luv ya stories) merissa(merissa what is there to say about merissa lol) steph (luv your stories too) sarah l.(you are such a blonde...dont evEr change!) ashley(WOW lol we need to hang out more) biss (you are so cute!) cassie(""aaaaa"" lol i luv ya cassie you are so funny always with the most energy in the room) carly gina angel tracy joleena lauren d. kathy lauren h. and the crazy guys i even luv~~josh u are so funny every time i am with you you make me laugh even when i am in a shitty mood but one thing i think is that i am ""cursed"" to be your friend JUST KIDDING! but thanks for making boring days days to remember you are the best guy friend any girl could ever ask for and i hope we always stay friends no matter what i will always be here for you if you need someone to talk to. hope we stay in touch after high school years. luke i miss ya i miss having some very odd conversations and having someone bothering me behind me in global!! austin ..gotta watch out for the quiet ones but once you start talking you never shut up! zach.. you are so random makes me laugh ""anything new"" ""nope, you"" ""nothing"" great conversations lol but some are more better than others  justin i can beat you at fly any day of the week! bring it on! and chill with the whole grade thing lol you are smart you dont need to be .001 smarter jeffrey i hope we will still remain friends and talk about anything you can always talk to me i got your back! james..thanks for always listening to my random sad stupid stories i appreciate it jordan you are so strange how did i become friends with you? j/k GO JETS!!!! christopher you i think are the longest so saved you for last! you are a great guy always make me laugh too and you are so sweet to me but especially to nicole she deserves a great guy and i think you two are perfectly* for each other i never have seen her smile so much when she is with you and when she isnt with you she is usually talking about you trust me i know and she would never ever in a million years hang out with some other guy when she has the chance to hang out with you so you can always check up on her she said but you can really trust that girl! thanks for being such a great friend. and dont listen to what other people say you have dealt with people saying alot of shit about you but you have proven them wrong and you will continuesly do so! i hope we STAY FRIENDS FOREVER!!!  well i got this whole thing from my dads doctor appointment kinda a complete turn but thats one and the major reason why my day was shitty


TODAY was a better day... i slept in untill 11:47 then i got up worked out!!! luved that! gotta get some arm muscles for tennis.. cant wait until that starts for all you track people you got guts because i suck at running track.. tennis is more my thing and nicole is on the team now so it brings more laughs and cant forget the coach! after working out i went in a shower to get all sparkly clean and hit the computer afterwards and good thing i did because sarah my doll wanted me to go to the swim meet. so i guickly signed off then finished getting ready and left and walked in the cold. ONLY FOR HER!! we saw the swim meet but then after diving she left me she left me HOW RUDE!!! (im sure you know were that is from lol) but its okay ashley was still there!

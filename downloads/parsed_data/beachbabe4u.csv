"event","On saturday I went to the baseball game at the dodger stadium that was fun cuz i was just with my friends. On Sunday I tried to get a tan and my mom was being pretty nice unlike usual. But then after I ate some pizza I went to my room like i usually do after i eat or whatever i usually am in my room. But anywayz she was yelling at me saying stuff being a BITCH because she thinks I'm balimic and anorexic and was being an ASSHOLE! I STRONGLY DISLIKE her! And I'm frustrated becuz i'm not and she basically doesn't trust me and is assuming things! I'm so PISSED!"

"event","I had so much fun this weekend. On Saturday Vinnie came over. Then on Sunday I went to Disneyland Hotel with my bro and Monique cuz Monique had a dance competition at first it was boring but then when they started doing the hip-hop it was interesting. After her competition we went to Downtown Disney and had dinner at House of Blues but they almost wouldn't seat us cuz we were just three teenagers but they ended up letting us in after they talked to the manager. (it was stupid) then we walked around and then came back to Simi and we went to Monique's uncles house then I went to hang out with Keely at her aunts house. But me and keely stil had fun we watched viva la bam.(lol) Today I didn't do much I laid outside for two hours trying to get a tan. Well, now I'm gonna go watch tv!

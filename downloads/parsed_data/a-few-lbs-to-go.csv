So not such a great day in terms of points, but I didn't eat any junk food which is a plus.&nbsp; I also have all my flex points left, so really it wasn't such a bad day today.&nbsp;"

"event","Dear anyone on Weight Watchers or any other weight loss program,

You must go out and buy <a href=""http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?Item=978096806310&Catalog=Books&Ntt=looneyspoons&N=35&Lang=en&Section=books&zxac=1"">Looneyspoons</a> and <a href=""http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?Item=978096806312&Catalog=Books&Ntt=crazy+plates&N=35&Lang=en&Section=books&zxac=1"">Crazy Plates</a> .&nbsp; Two awesome cookbooks which are low in calories and fat.&nbsp; The food in these books taste amazing and the dishes are really easy to prepare.&nbsp; 

Also, if you're looking for low fat cookies and bars check out<a href=""http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?Item=978155285422&Catalog=Books&Ntt=one+smart+cookie&N=35&Lang=en&Section=books&zxac=1"">One Smart Cookie</a>.&nbsp; Again, the recipes are really simple but are extremely good and not high in points (or fat, or calories).&nbsp; 

These three cookbooks (along with <a href=""http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?Item=978002863716&Catalog=Books&Ntt=complete+weight+watchers&N=35&Lang=en&Section=books&zxac=1"">this one</a>) have gotten me through most of my time on Weight Watchers.&nbsp; 

Love,
LarlissM."

As you can see I have a long way to go, but I know if I just stick to it and keep on track I'll eventually get to where I want to be."

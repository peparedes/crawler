I go out there and get her again
Then she does it to me, but I bent over cause I was laughing so hard
And she wets my back>>>>
Pam turns the sprinklers on, and we start to run threw them
We had our clothes on still... so Pam gives me some of her clothes to put on>>>>>>
Then we had this BRIGHT idea>>> we Made a home made ""Slip-N-Slide""
Guess what we used???
Plastic Bag things that were covering Pam's new Bed she got from Ikea!
I drenched it with Dish washing soap>>> It was the Funniest
Slide Slide Slippity Slide!! Ooooo-Yeah!!!
Then I made up a water game and it goes like this>>>>>
Pam and me have cups full of water
And Pam pretends to be talking to someone
And I go.,,,, ""I have to talk to you""
and she goes...""About What!?""
And then I go.... ""I've been cheating on you, with your FATHER!""
and then she goes... ""You BI*CH!!""
And throws the water in my face.... it kept us busy for like 30mins I SWEAR!!!
Then I wanted Ronnie to come ova cause I knew he'd make it fun with the Slip in Slide...... So we picked him up with Jose..... it was soo much fun... intell Ronnie kept pantsing me and he saw where the sun don't shine!! Hahaha it was funny though, Pam was trying to protect me! HA!

"event","Moira is kind of a strange puppy.  We've put a couple gates in our kitchen doorways so that entire area is effectively her playpen; it's where she eats, drinks, sleeps, plays, and pees and poops.  We've gotten her a ton of different toys to play with and it was once rather hazardous walking around in the kitchen.  If you weren't watching out, you'd either step on Moira, who was always underfoot, or one of her toys.  Now though...things are different.

I noticed a couple weeks ago that she takes all her toys with her into her pet carrier, where her bed is.  I thought that was a little strange and commented on it to Evan, but didn't think much more of it.  Then, today, I realized what she was doing.

She had just gotten up from a nap when I went into the kitchen to get a drink.  She yawned, stretched, padded over, and then sat down right by my feet.  I sat down on the floor with her and petted her a little bit before she got up and left, like she typically does since she's kind of cat-like in her aloofness.  I was about to get back up again when she came back over to me with her rope toy and set it on my knee.  I took this as a sign she wanted to play, so play we did.  We tugged at the rope and made a lot of silly noises for maybe 10 minutes or so, and I was enjoying playing with my suddenly dog-like dog.  Then she quit tugging on her end of the rope and went to get a drink.  She came back over, grabbed her toy, and put it back in her carrier before eating her dinner.

So...my puppy cleans up after herself!  How crazy is that?"

"event","It's been storming a couple hours now and at first it was kinda scary (with the tornado sirens going and all), but it's calmed down quite a bit.  Apparently they're forecasting some wintry weather tomorrow, which is really bizarre since the high was in the 70s yesterday.  Crazy Oklahoma weather.

I start a new rotation tomorrow at Baptist, right down the street from where I live.  I signed up for it initially because I'd heard the hours were great (8am-noon) and the doctor we work with is a great teacher, but I found out a couple days ago that I'd have to work weekends!  I haven't worked a single weekend since maybe April last year, so I'm not sure I'm prepared for this.  I'll be working my butt off starting July, so I feel I deserve a few more free weekends! =P

Do pets go through the equivalent of the terrible twos in kids?  Based on how things have been with Moira the last few days, I'm starting to wonder if I'll have to patience to deal with my offspring when the time comes...

Sigh...this is a rather pointless entry.  I've just been a bum so I don't have much to post about.  Hopefully I'll have more interesting things to say soon..."

I've been wondering what I should have embroidered on my pretty new doctors' coats.  I'll introduce myself to everyone as ""Gina,"" but that's not my given name, which is what I use to sign everything.  I think this could be confusing to patients and their parents.  Maybe it'll say <i>Phi-Yen ""Gina"" Bui</i>.  Seem reasonable?  I still haven't really decided yet.  I also haven't decided if I want some nice, pretty script-type font or something colorful and kid's handwriting-like.  

After seeing dozens of babies in clinic and talking to their parents for what seems like hours on end about poop, I started believing that parents are just crazy...who obsesses over poop?  It's freakin' poop!  Then I got a puppy...and I find myself thinking about her poop.  (Surely there's some kind of dog food out there that wouldn't be quite so stinky...)

I'm hoping some friends will be free to come over and hang out this weekend.  I'm scared to take Moira anywhere for very long since she's still so young and sleeps (and poops) all the time.  Hopefully people can come over, we can order some sushi, and just relax here while playing with the puppy.



So...anyone out there with dogs have suggestions about food and less-stinky poop?  I'm gonna go crazy pretty soon if this lasts much longer."

I finally started really working again today after being a bum for about 3 months or so.  Peds GI Clinic was pretty fun (more than I expected) and even though I was there from 9am-4pm (the horror!), I didn't feel too tired until after Evan and I got back from a delicious Greek dinner at Zorba's.  Now it's only 9:30 and I'm ready for bed...hopefully I'll get used to working a full 7 hours a day again soon =P

"event","Evan and I moved all our stuff in last Tuesday and are slowly but surely getting settled in.  We actually cooked some rice yesterday, and my mom has sent us quite a bit of food.  Some friends came over and hung out Wednesday night, and I'm pretty excited because some more friends (hopefully the whole group) are coming over tomorrow night for a cookout.  Evan's mom got us an outdoor grill, so we'll be making burgers and hotdogs.

Today my sisters came to pick me up (isn't that crazy?!?) and we went to the mall.  We'd sort of planned our trip around going to New York & Co. but they're remodeling, so we were at a bit of a loss until we went to American Eagle and all bought the same pair of lounging pants.  I'm looking forward to looking like twinkies w/them while sitting around watching <i>Scrubs</i> and <i>Arrested Development</i>.  Later on, my parents and sisters came back to pick me up so we could have some sushi.  Unfortunately, the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for the holiday, so we ended up at Musashi's.  It was fun, but rather disappointing since their sushi selection is pretty slim.  The guy at the table across from us more than made up for it though.  He had the most contagious laugh I've heard in a long, long time.

Maybe I'll do a real, detailed update later.  I'm mostly doing this because Evan keeps remarking that I haven't updated in a while."

"event","I made some pretty detailed notes for our biggest class last year and have gotten a lot of positive feedback for them.  With quite a bit of encouragement, I thought it might be neat to try and get this things printed to sell to the underclassmen.  The idea was promptly pushed to the back of my mind once studying started though, until today.  Zack sent me links to a couple sites that publish books and my interest in the idea has been renewed.  It actually looks like it'll be cheaper for me to publish everything than just to make copies at a place like Kinko's.  I just don't know if other students would prefer having a book to flip through or sheets of paper that they can move around (put in binders, add more notes, etc) as needed.  I suppose this is something I'll definitely need to research after tomorrow.

Today's supposed to be my day off before my test, but I kinda started it early yesterday.  So instead of just bumming around like I wanted, I still have a few things to review and a couple charts here and there, but I think I'm pretty much done studying.  Not much else is gonna fit in my head between now and tomorrow morning.

Starting tomorrow afternoon, I'm treating myself to a few days of shopping =D  I have some Nintendo DS games to buy to go with my spankin' new DS Lite, I still need more professional attire starting next month, my dad and I are gonna look for a dining table and chairs, and there are still a <b>ton</b> of little things to buy for the condo.  After that, I'll slowly start moving things in and cleaning up so that after Evan's test, we can get settled in right away.

In other completely random news, my sisters and I messed around with Google Talk last night.  The chat feature in Gmail rotates emoticons 90 degrees so that they're vertical and actually look like faces, but the Google Talk program lets you ""call"" people and actually talk to them (yeah...I called my sisters who were just a few rooms away).  In the midst of playing around with this, I discovered that my laptop has a built-in mic =)  After I move, I can bother my sisters by singing obnoxiously to them!"

We're holding off on buying it just yet since the price has been steadily decreasing on Amazon, but we'll definitely order it before June 30th so we can still get that $100 rebate.  Besides that, we also plan on getting a dinette set, a couple patio chairs (probably nice, cheap ones from Walmart or something), and a decent-sized charcoal grill.  Luckily, we have just about everything else we need already.  If everything's in place and ready to go like we want, then we'll be able to host a little party July 7th or 8th for our friends before going to see <i>Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest</i> later that evening.

Anna's final photography project is coming along nicely, and I helped come up with the idea.  If she agrees, I'll have to post them for everyone to see.

Next week is my last test block, EVER.  We have this stupid comprehensive test the following Monday that doesn't count for anything and doesn't go towards anything, so Evan and I will be celebrating starting Friday night =D

The week after test block is when we're gonna close on the condo.  So, I'm gonna own a condo!  We won't move in until the end of June/beginning of July though, since we still have that other test thing to worry about between now and then.  I need to take a week off first to recuperate before diving back into the books, notecards, and practice questions.  And I need to do lots of shopping for the condo.  We've gotten tons of free stuff so far, but there are still a lot of things left we'll need to buy.  Pictures and whatnot coming soon (probably during my next long study break or something).  This is all I've been able to think about since a little after Spring Break.

May 14th is Zack and Ashley's wedding.  This is pretty exciting, since he's the first one in our group to get married.  Seriously, I never, ever would have thought he'd be the first one if you'd asked me before we all started collage nearly six (!!!) years ago.

She came home a little while ago, came upstairs to talk to me about her day, and then left so I could study.  For the first time since she got back from the store, I went downstairs just a few minutes ago and discovered 8 2L bottles of Diet Coke sitting next to the fridge, completely crowding my mom's counter space.  I laughed and laughed and laughed some more thinking about how utterly ridiculous she must have looked at Albertson's, pushing around a cart full of nothing but Diet Coke.

I've read over my notes so many times now that I should know it forwards and backwards, but I don't.  Instead of concentrating on it like I should though, I keep turning to my computer and looking at things I want to buy for my place when I move out.  It's all rather premature too, since I'm not 100% sure it'll happen (let's say I'm about 95% sure...just not certain I'll get the place I want).  But I can't help looking anyway and I just shrug everything off as yet another study break (maybe I should turn off my computer so I'm not so tempted to window-shop online).  Lucky for me, Evan doesn't seem to mind that moving is practically the only thing I've talked about besides school for the last couple of weeks.

"event","I never really update anymore because I feel I don't have that much to say.  My life has gone on pretty much as it has since I started med school; I study a lot but not as much as I should, I spend time with my loved ones, and I occasionally freak out about growing up.  Finally though, I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and am realizing that the last two years weren't completely worthless, even though it often feels that way.

When I was first accepted over two years ago, I was excited but didn't really think much of it.  Becoming a doctor was more-or-less a fact in my mind, and I wasn't really afraid of not getting in.  I was completely naive at the time and was under the impression that it wasn't really going to be much harder than all the years of school I've already had.  Of course, people told me things would be tough but I brushed them aside.  Every time I've changed schools, whether it was from elementary to junior high, junior high to high school, or high school to college, I've encountered people who predicted doom and destruction for those of us who didn't completely change our study habits and adapt to the brand new, foreign environment we were about to be thrown into.  And each of those times, I learned that everyone was exaggerating and that school's never really that difficult.  I rarely studied, always procrastinated, always left everything to the last minute, and always did well.  So I figured med school wouldn't be that much different and was hit hard with the fact that it is very, very different.

Much of my first year was filled with panic.  I never felt on top of things, there was so much material every single day, and I constantly felt overwhelmed.  I squeaked by without too much damage to my grades, but my ego was bruised and I knew things had to change if I wanted to make it out of here alive.  So second year started after a too-short summer vacation, and I fell back into putting things off.  It was so easy to not want to study when tests were a month and a half away, and I had grown accustomed to having fun instead of locking myself up with my books and notes.  Luckily though, I did eventually make myself start studying much earlier than I would have in the past, and school wasn't too bad anymore.  The classes this year are infinitely more difficult and it feels like we learn twice as much material as last year in half the time, but I was relatively caught up and didn't feel like I was drowning anymore.

However, around Thanksgiving Break or so, I started feeling like I was running into a brick wall.  The material we had to know really wasn't that bad, but there's always so much stuff going on that it all became overwhelming again.  I started hearing upperclassmen say that most of second year isn't a struggle with the material, it's a struggle with your attitude, and I couldn't possibly agree more.  I was sick and tired of the lectures, the meetings, dressing up for fake interviews, and everything else they make us do.  Many of our lecturers were terrible and even if the material made sense, they made it confusing and difficult to follow.  I didn't want to think about the big test I'll have to take during the summer, but that's all anyone would talk about because it's so important.  My class as a whole fell into a general depression, and I think the only treatment is getting through this together and moving on with our lives.

Now, I feel so ready for our classes to be over.  I've scheduled my test (June 14th), and I can't wait until June 15th.  My mom, sister, and I looked at this beautiful apartment yesterday and if all goes well, I'll be all moved in over there after the test and will finally get to start my third year as a med student and my new life living away from home.  I'll interact with patients, learn tricks of the trade, and get to do what I've waited my whole life to do.  My tiny glimmer of light is beckoning me, but I still have 3 or 4 months before I can reach it."

Last week, my modmates and I had a surprise baby shower for a fellow modmate's wife.&nbsp; She thought it was very sweet of us and to show her appreciation, has offered to provide all sorts of treats for us while we're stressing out over our tests.&nbsp; It all started today when her husband brought in some homemade brownies (mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, brownies).&nbsp; I used to joke about them adopting me around test block so I could eat all these yummy desserts (she's very sweet and always cooking and baking things for us), but now I think that might not be such a bad idea.

I need to think of a movie to rent after test block's over, preferably something I haven't seen yet.&nbsp; Any ideas?"

"event","Ugh...the apathy has set in again for this test block.  I'm really good at making reviews, notecards, charts, or whatever else as study aids, but I can't seem to make myself actually USE them once they're done.  I've been told by my classmates that they're really good though, so maybe I should just read them over and over until I have them memorized (yucky).

Tomorrow for lunch, we have some type of ""scheduling workshop"" that's required for all students staying in OKC (and not going to Tulsa) for 3rd year.  I think this is where they'll tell us how we'll pick our schedules and give us our randomly assigned numbers so we know when we get to pick them, but I'm pretty annoyed that they've decided to do it this week instead of 1 or 2 weeks ago, when time isn't quite so precious.  I'm becoming more and more convinced that some of the administration don't really want us to do well at all.

Other than studying, I haven't done much else over the last few days.  I did kind of pay attention to the Super Bowl last night to watch the commercials, but I was mostly disappointed.  I did enjoy seeing MacGyver in action again though =)  Also, Evan and I have been talking about what to do with our friends once we have some free time again, and it looks like we might watch <i>Jaws</i> (an oldy but a goody) or something new (probably bad) and entertaining, like <i>Doom</i>.  Last time we rented a movie, it was the latest <i>Resident Evil</i>, which fit perfectly into the ""so bad it's good"" mold we were looking for.  It was completely mindless fun, with lots of special effects and implausible situations."

"event","<P>Since I haven't updated since mid-December (!!!), I'll just do a quick run-through of my life since then:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The final test block last semester wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.&nbsp; I did just fine on the tests, but the stress and frustration I feel and the overwhelming amount of material thrown at us really had me down.&nbsp; We saw a bunch of interviewees walking around campus, and I was both amazed and saddened when I realized that just 2 years ago, I was excited about getting into med school and couldn't wait to start the next part of my life.&nbsp; It helped a bit when I found out that nearly all my classmates felt the same way (and practically all MS2s before us), but that didn't change my feelings towards school itself.&nbsp; I just have to keep reminding myself that I only have a few more months until I get to actually go to the hospitals and interact with patients.</LI>
<LI>Finally, our 2 week Winter Break started and my friends and I celebrated by going out to eat and catching <EM>King Kong</EM> together.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun and was the first time so many of us were able to get together in what felt like ages.&nbsp; Christmas rolled around and Evan got me <A href=""http://shopping.discovery.com/product-58997.html?tcp=DVD-featured-MythBuster"">Mythbusters Season 1 on DVD</A>, one of the coolest gifts ever =D</LI>
<LI>After Christmas, 7 of us took our little road trip to Indianapolis to see the <A href=""http://shopping.discovery.com/product-58997.html?tcp=DVD-featured-MythBuster"">Lord of the Rings Exhibit</A>, which was even better than I thought it was going to be.&nbsp; I've never felt nerdier, but it felt gooooood =)</LI>
<LI>Once we were back from our trip, my friends and I got together a few more times, taking advantage of our time off.&nbsp; We played some video games and board games, went out to eat, and just hung out like in the good ol' days.&nbsp; A few of us also saw <EM>Munich</EM>, which was excellent.</LI>
<LI>School started again on Jan 3rd.&nbsp; I felt refreshed after the break and ready to deal with one final semester of lecture halls and test blocks.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our most important class has been rather disorganized this entire test block, and it's left me pretty frustrated.&nbsp; We don't have all the material we need, and our next test block is coming up in a couple weeks.&nbsp; Some of the lecturers have been fantastic, and others have made me want to poke my eyes out with the corners of my incomplete syllabus.</LI>
<LI>Our deans had lunch with our class a few weeks ago to talk to us about USMLE Step 1, which we'll all have to take this summer.&nbsp; I know this test is a big deal and that it will basically make or break me, but our deans are quite possibly the WORST people at telling our class this news (not news really, we all know how important it is).&nbsp; They seem to think that scaring us away from failure is better motivation than kindness and encouraging words.&nbsp; Bastards.</LI></UL>
<P>This brings me up to date.&nbsp; Now I need to get back to studying and figuring out just what it is I need to know for our next test, since we don't have any proper reading material from the lecturers like we're supposed to =(</P>"

Evan, Ann, Matt, Lam (Ann's brother), my sisters, and I are all definitely going, and a couple other friends might join us too.

I'm so excited!!!  I must have told Evan all the details about a dozen times already, but he doesn't seem to mind (I hope).

I've spent the last few days post-test block basically watching a lot of TV shows both on TV and on DVD.  I highly recommend <i>Arrested Development</i>, <i>Extras</i>, and <i>Scrubs</i> to anyone who enjoys great comedy, <i>Mythbusters</i> for the inner destructive geek in all of us, and <i>Rome</i> and <i>Lost</i> because they're both damn good TV.  <i>The Daily Show</i>, <i>The Colbert Report</i>, and <i>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</i> are also on my must-watch list since they're the best talk shows out there.  Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure I'll have to cut back on all this slacking off pretty soon, since the next test block is just a little over a month away =(

Until then though, I'll keep playing around and enjoying myself, all while looking forward to my trip!"

Most of my days consist of sleeping in a bit, working out, and then laying around the house reading, watching TV, or playing on the computer all afternoon.  Most nights I hang out with friends and basically lounge around some more as we watch movies or TV shows together.  It's also been storming here a lot lately, so I get to curl up in bed to enjoy a good book while hoping the lights don't go out on me.  

In addition to being a lazy bum, my sisters and I have gone shopping a few times and I've finally gotten the chance to do things I never had time to during the school year.  I also went with my sisters to see <b>Mae</b> and <b>The Academy Is...</b> perform at The Green Door earlier this month, and it was awesome.  As fun as that was, I'm really looking forward to seeing <b>The Killers</b>, who are coming here August 15th.  <b>Keane</b> is in concert tonight in Dallas; if I had known about it beforehand, I would have liked to see them also.

My friends and I all went to the midnight showing of <i>Star Wars Episode 3</i>, which turned out to be really good.  We were with a great, laid-back crowd in the theater and saw plenty of people dressed up for the movie.  As much as I enjoyed that movie though, I think <i>Batman Begins</i> was even better.  Everyone was great except Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's deep, gravelly voice was annoying, but those two things were the only parts of the whole movie that I didn't like.  My sisters really want to see it, so it looks like I'll be taking them sometime next week.  I can't imagine this movie not being as good the second time around.

"event","My hair's been bothering me for the past few weeks for no real reason besides the fact that it's looked basically the same for more than a year now, give or take a few inches.  So after some intense non-debate, I got a haircut Thursday morning, trimming off about 6 inches or so and re-layering it, bringing it from mid-back to barely-below-the-shoulders.  I'm completely happy with how it turned out except for the little random hairs that keep falling over my eye.  One of these days, when I'm not feeling oh-so-lazy, I'll post a picture of what it looks like.  Until then, just picture me looking even cuter than before. =D

Only 2 weeks left!  I can't tell anymore if I'm excited about finishing or scared of the tests.  Either way, I'm ready for the break. =)"

"event","My last test is on May 13th, and I'm completely free after that to hang out, see movies, go clubbing, and best of all, <b>sleep</b>.  I don't have any solid, definite plans for the summer yet, but Ann and I did toss around some ideas the other day.  Whatever we end up doing, I'm sure it'll be a lot more entertaining than these notes I'm reading have been so far.

I guess I sorta lied about not having any definite plans this summer.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JNEQ/ref=wl_it_dp/104-6841499-2228751?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I2OMCZVEUO9XGU&v=glance&colid=2OLNMFDULFHF5"">The first season of Scrubs</a> comes out May 17th and I've already pre-ordered it, so I'll spend a few days watching those episodes and the extras.  (I know that's dorky, but I'm looking forward to it.)  I'll also see <i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i> sometime after tests are over, and then a group of us will join hardcore Star Wars nerds at the midnight showing of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.

First though, there are these three tests to deal with.  Once those are over with, I'm halfway through the test blocks we have to deal with =)"

In other news, it looks like a big group of us (7 or 8) will be seeing <i>Star Wars</i> on opening night.  I'm already looking forward to it because it's during the first week of Summer Vacation, which means I'm free of school for 3 whole months!!!"

"event","I just went to Philz Coffee here near my house on 18th Street in SF.  They have such yummy cawfee.  Regretfully the location near me doesn't have the vegan donuts.  I have to go all the way to 24th and Folsom Philz for those.  I haven't tried them yet but I can't wait!  One of these morning when I wake up early I am going to go over there.  It is hard to find donuts that are made without lard.  Some places I just don't trust and some places use natural flavorings which contain animal products like lard or beeffat.  for example I totally don't trust Krispty Kremes ever since I saw on one of their boxes in the ingredients section that they used animal fat of some sort.  I have never had a Krispy Kremes donut ever and I never will, I just don't trust them.  

Anywho my 8gb CF card for my digital camera bit the dust.  What a hassle.  Never buy RIDATA products.  They blow.

There needs to be a planet-wide effort made to have people work near where they live to reduce the amount of pollution from cars.  If people don't know how to do the job then they need to be trained.  Save the earth.  If we all stopped worrying about being greedy and instead worried about the greater-good then we would all be better off.  I know it sound like socialism or marxism or something like that, but oh well."

Anyways, not much new here.  Still a bouncer, still doing photography, still working in a photolab.  I have a girlfriend that I have an open relationship with and I am just enjoying life.  Current interests include; caffeine, drawing, learning new languages and looking at old photos by other photographers."

I just got home from Hot Pants, my favorite lesbian bar in SF.  I was looking for an incredibly sexy girl named Ash that I made out with on Wednesday who said she would be there but I couldn't find her.  I was thinking to myself, ""This sucks, I am in a bad mood now, I should go home.""  I saw a lot of people I know but even still, i was so sad.  Then two sisters started to talk to me who are customers at the bar I work at.  we were dancing it up and they really cheered me up.  The older one was flirting with me and I really started to cheer up then before you know it I was actually having fun.  Woohoo.  We hung out with Lisa for awhile and talked to a lot of people.  I drank a 40 oz before I left the house then I had three? more beers when I got there.  My head hurts a little as I write this, lol.  

Anyways, Lourdes, the girl who was cheering me up started holding my hand and dancing with me buying me a drink and I bought her one.  After awhile we were making out hardcore.  It was nice.  She was getting me mad horny.  My lipstick got all messed up and usually I am really anal about that and I will fix it right away but I was so happy I didn't care.  So finally we found Lourdes' sister.  Then I ran into Chondra and lifted her up off the ground and her legs are incredibly strong and she gripped me like a motherfucker.  I had no idea she had legs like that, lol.  then right after that I saw a TS girl that had sex with over a month ago and I talked to her.  she thanked me for the sex we had and apologized for never calling me.  I told her it was all good.  I kissed Lourdes goodbye grabbed my jacket and left.  

I was so hungry I got a torta at LOS COYOTES Taqueria on 16th st. on my way home.    They took forever to cook it, OMG, never going back.  It tasted yummy, but nearly as good as my favorite place.    

I have work in less than 6 hours so I better go to bed.  After I get off of work I have to my other job.  Gonna work 15 hours tomorrow between the two places, which is cool, because I need the money.  

Still a little sad Ash never showed up.  doesn't she want my hot ass?  lol  But it worked out because now I have girl who is serious about me and I know we are going to be monogamous girlfriends.  I like Lourdes a lot, she is amazing.  I need a steady girlfriend, I think this is it for me.  she speaks spanish which is dope, I can practice what I know and learn more.  She eats meat, which sucks, but oh well, she is still a good person.  She said she will cook veggie food for me and maybe I can stear her away from eating meat.  I can tell this girl and I are going to fall in love.  She gives me butterflies.  I miss having a Latina-American girlfriend.  I love the food and the television, lol.  Lourdes looks lesbian and I love that.  She is hot and has an incredible ass.  mmmm  She had to drive her sister home so no sleep-overs, but that is cool because I can tell this is serious.  She is going to visit me at work tomorrow night.

Oh and something I wanted to say is

Maybeline Great Lash Mascara > Lola Mascara 
I got the Lola for free thank the goddess.  Lola costs six times as much the Maybeline but the Maybeline is 100 times better.  Lola Mascara sucks, stick with the Maybeline Great Lash Blackest Black ladies."

"event","Life is hard.  It's crazy.  I am not religious whatsoever.  I do not believe in God or any supreme source outside of your own human body.  People that believe in spirituality, religion, ghosts, UFOs, heaven ,& hell, or astrology are crazy.  

When my friend Saki ""Rob"" Meyer died his family had a ""wake"" at their house in Richmond, CA.  After the church ceremony we went to their house.  It was so sad without Rob there to bust a joke or light a big blunt up or something.  He died so young and so horribly.  Rob's parents partied at the wake.  They were legitimately happy and were not crying.  They were playing reggae music and dancing enthusiastically.  They were celebrating Rob's life just the way  he would have wanted it celebrated.  Now in my family a wake is a very sad and somber event full of crying and sad faces.   I was raised wrong and look at death wrong.  Cuz there is nothing to cry about.  Only a fool would cry over something that is inevitable and unstoppable.  

Anyways.  Sometimes I like to say stuff I think in my journal so people know how I thinkand what I think about.      *sigh*

I showed my friend who is a graffiti writer some drawings that Mike ""Dream"" Francisco did in some drawings in my graffiti sketchbooks.  He really loved them.  I miss Mike and it sucks to know I will never see himagain.  I am working on improving my skills as a graffiti writer and as a photogrpher because those are my two life's passions.  I have to be like Mike and be the best I can.  I have already done some work to be proud of, but there is more to come.  The things I am most proud of are the full color graffiti pieces I have done.  especially the ones done in SF off of Army St. and the huge color piece on highway 80 freeway near El Cerrito.  And for photography I really like my shots of Al Gore and Bill Clinton.  

My roomate has MS and she is sick all the time.  My other friend Searcy just got diagnosed with Leukemia and he could die too.  My grandma ...I think she is 93 now....I am sure death isn't too far away for her.  

Life sucks.  I have financial troubles and I seem to be surrounded by death and the things I see about or here about are always...horrible.  people tell me the craziest things.

But I will roll on.  I have been getting in shape physically lately working out and improving both my computer and photography skills.  I look forward to seeing what kind of art and photos I produce as I age.  I think I am my own biggest fan.  I am going to be 70 and still tagging.  Maybe I'll be a fetish photographer and drive a modified Mercedes with a 105 db exhaust.  lol

I am learning how to batch process RAW images and it is really fun.  Digital photography is so amazing and having a new DSLR has really opened up this world for me.  However, a part of me still hates digital.  Film, especially B&W, is simply amazing.  The more I shoot digital, the more I love film photography.  I do love digital, just not as much as film.  35mm B&W film is like heaven to me.  

My life would be so much different if I had money.  Money controls everything.  Thank the goddess I live in America where people are spoiled.  I could have it so much worse.  At least I am sexy and beautiful...so I have that going for me.  *giggles*  But on a serious note....do you ever see people dying of starvation on the news?  No, you see the weather and some car crashes.  Such bullsh*t.

well on that ""positive,"" happy and upbeat note, I am off to bed"

"event","I had a nightmare that I went to a nightclub and somebody stole my flash and then somebody stole my camera.  It was horrible.  i have been having a lot of nightmares lately.  

I have been depressed and I have no energy lately.  Part of the problem is caffeine, no money and a fear for my life after getting a couple threats.  It's sad I have to worry about a crackhead and his friends who don't like me cuz i won't let the crackhead live at my apartment.  we bagged up his room and saved the best and tossed the rest.  He is going to be mad next time I see him and I am ready for a fight.  The last letter he wrote me has got me paranoid.  Someone put a syringe through my mail slot the other day.  I don't think it was from the crackhead, but who knows.  Somebody followed me the other day also, or maybe he was just going the same way.  

Anyways, life sucks right now.  Only good thing going for me is a girl who is 33 like me.  She is really sweet and pretty and I have some strong feelings for her.  We were hanging out this week.  We went to Hot Pants at the Cat Club and to Boy Bar.  And the Lex.  I have been dating a LOT of girls lately, but most are flakes.  I hope this new one won't be a flake.  I keep telling her she is my girlfriend and she just smiles or laughs.  She doesn't agree or disagree, so I don't know.  I guess she is my girlfriend.  *shrug*  She has a tricked out Honda S2000 and I let her drive my ep3 and she really was a great driver.  I think she said she used to drag race.  That was a big turn on for me for sure.  She is Morrocan and Phillipino and I think some other stuff too.     

I wonder if there really is an energy in the universe like a chi.  Like a yin yang.  Like a negative and positive energy.  For example, if you do something bad, will something bad happen to you?  Or is this just a bullshit theory created by religious people.  Is there such a thing as Karma.  Or is there such a thing as heaven and hell?  Should I be a cold selfish bitch or should I have a heart.  Should I steal everything I can since everyone else does.  SHould I be an opportunistic scumbag like everyone else.  

Nahhhh, it's not my style.

I have to more careful because this guy's friend is in jail for raping Maddy's roomate.  Luckily, I am strong and I survived to talk about it.  Very scary experience.  Why do guys have to be such dogs.  that's why I haven't slept with a guy yet, they treat me like a sex object just because I am a transsexual.

Last night I brought a guy home from work that I like.  We drank at work and smoked weed at my place.  My plan was to have sex with him, but then I chickened out.  He just wasn't making me horny.  I am not used to guys so it was really awkward for me.  So looks like I get to keep my lesbian gold star.  Honestly, I don't think I will ever sleep with a guy.  I am a lesbian.  The only reason I say I am bisexual is because I am open-minded.  But guys just don't turn me on like females do.  who knows, I contradict myself so often.  

I am the worst procrastinator in the world.  Ok, not really, but I am really bad.  too lazy to explain why.  

I am stoned, off to bed.  Alone.  Two different guys were begging me to have sex with them tonight.  But one was too short and the other was too drugged out.  I got one phone number from a butch baby dyke and I gave my phone number to an Asian girl that drives a tricked out Isuzu with JAOS mudflaps.  Last night Pablo from Orphan Andy's gave me free french fries.  Grats papas fritas.  lol  He likes me a lot.    

Well, being a bouncer is fun.  So many girls show me their pussies I lose track.  I am off of work for the next two nights.  Hopefully they will be fun-filled nights.

SEPTEMBER 4, 2006 entry

Today I did nitrous and smoked out with some pretty girls.  Surfed the Net, watched some TV.  Cooked some fish tacos and grilled cheese sandwiches today.  I had work tonight.  So much drama, it was crazy again.  I broke a fight between 12 people and blah blah blah.  The other night my Security co-worker beat the *ish outta some huge dude.  what a crazy fight, I saw it all.  Tonight was crazy too.  Anyways, I am single now and it sucks.  Well, I have a girlfriend in an open relationship but she is flaky and doesn't spend enuff time with me.  I want monogamy again.  This poly thing gets too complicated and I am too emotional for it.   

Need to get a day job.  Been working in Hayward the last couple weekends at a Pro Photo Lab.  Need a steadier day job.  Steve Irwin, The Crocodile Hunter died.  Very sad, I saw my friend Ivana from Australia tonight too and she was talkin' 'bout it.  A hole into the heart...crazy."

Jess and I are a lot alike.  I am happy.  We are having a polyamorous relationship which means we can fuck other people, together or by ourselves.  I like some other girls too.  I had a few spend the night recently.  I turned down a boy last night (didn't want to lose my lesbian gold star, plus he didn't meet the height requirements).  Being a bouncer helps my love life.  :)  

I got a new computer, a new digital camera body and I finally got a garage parking space so I don't have to wash my car so much.  Of course right after I bought my computer a better one came out.  Oh well.  That's life.    

Life is fucking good right now.  I just have to stay sharp and make sure I don't let things crumble.  Gotta end my procrastinations!"

Before the party Cheryl and I took photos around the Castro.  Then we went to Firewood and then I drove us to Hot Pants.  Cheryl took some cool photos in the Castro.  My camera body was giving me problems.  No worries, I have a new one coming soon.  Getting my first DSLR camera body.  I have a new Apple also to use for my photography work.

Anyways, hanging out with Cheryl was great.  Hopefully we will hang out more soon.  Perhaps when I get my new camera body.  

Tonight I have my Bouncer job.  Hopefully nobody wants to fight me.  *sigh*  I know some people will want to fuck me at least (a bouncer job perk) ...but regretfully they are usually people I don't like.  I want to keep the bouncer job for awhile unless it gets too dangerous.  Since I am a girl not too many people want to fight me.  thank the goddess"

I have been a bouncer at a gay nightclub for about half a year now.  I have tons of crazy stories to tell.  The nightclub is a short walk from my house so that's great.  I meet lots of people.  It's a lot easier finding people to date when you work at a nightclub, so that has been working out for me.

Been doing photography as usual.  More 35mm work.  I have been doing personal projects and some event coverage.  Shooting my friends and stuff.  

I am expecting UPS to deliver my new Apple G5 any minute now.  I am looking forward to leaving PCs behind and going back to Apple.  Last Apple I had was the Apple IIc.  Main reason I want this machine is for my photography work.  I am super serious about my photography.  Need to get a portfolio Online.  I am the world's worst procrastinator.  =)

Been working on my car doing the full racecar interior.  Having a lot of fun with it.  

So hot in San Francisco today.  It's crazy.  I hate the heat.  I like foggy cool days with very low winds.  I have a suntan now because I painted my car rims black in the sun.  

I have been on estrogen constantly with no breaks since 1999.  Still enjoy living fulltime as a woman, no regrets at all.  

Been a little sick lately, but nothing major.  I have health insurance thank the Goddess so they will fix me up.  

I was considering myself to be bisexual, but I am such a lesbian.  Still have my lesbian gold star since I have never slept with a boy yet.  I have been fooling around with some femme lesbians and bisexual girls lately.  It's fun being a bouncer at a gay club, lol.

"event","Somebody broke into a van right outside of my window last night at 4:20AM.  The van belings to a plumbing place and it had security bars so nobody could get into the back.  I thought I heard somebody trying to open the garage door forcefully then they stopped when they realized how loud it was.  I thought I heard a beer bottle breaking outside last night actually.  I had a bad feeling that somebody was out there up to no good but I was too deep asleep and not sure if I was just paranoid or not.  Instead of breaking into vans at four in the morning these losers need to figure out how to earn an honest living.  They need to get some morals before they end up burning for eternity in Hell.  

Had some good coffee this morning.  Good flavor.  My new favorite coffee place in the neighborhood.  My computer keeps crashing super hard.  I might be OFFLINE here pretty soon.  9 out of ten times when I start my computer it says, ""Operating System Not Found.""  My other machine does the same thing 99.99657% of the time.  I hate HPs.  Well, who knows how many hours of useage these machines have on them, I got my money's worth.  Whatever files are on these machines I pretty much consider lost.  The CD burners won't work on these machines.  Gotta work on backing up whatever files I want to keep before this machine flatlines forever."

"event","<small>Tonight was my first night as a bouncer at a dance club that's only 5 minutes away from me.  Quyen came to the club.  I thought she was Cheryl at first.  I am such an idiot.  My memory is ...nonexistant to spotty at best.  Fuck, lol.  Sometimes I say the weirdest things.  Anyways, Quyen and her ex-girlfriend were looking really sexy.  I want both of them to have their way with me.  lol  I wonder if I have a chance with either of them.  I just let Quyen know I wanna go clubbing with her and to tell Cheryl if she is interested.  That's my new technique, let them chase me.  Now that I work at a nightclub I am gonna have more booty than I know what to do with.  

I learned all of the secret passageways through the club that are for security only.  Pretty cool.  I get free drinks, but no alcohol.  I had a few Red Bulls.  Woot!  lol, that is gonna save me money ciz I am a Red Bull junkie.  Well, I usually get Rockstar or Monster cuz you get more ounces, but Red Bull has the classic taste.  If I don't have to pay then I would choose Red Bull.  The damn cans are so small though.  I love being a security guard.  Until somebody pukes on me of course, then it is gonna suck.  

I was checking everyone's ID at the club.  Kinda scary because some people have a real problem with authority.  I was being nice and a couple people gave me a little bit of attitude.  But I have backup bigtime and since I am the girl, the boys want to protect me.  C* is really nice and I would mind hooking up with him.  lol  And L* is totally dope, we have great conversations.  He is just like Melvin and I used to be, except more open-minded.  I think L* has no idea that I am mtf.  Some of the things he said give away that he has no idea that I am mtf.  I just need some plastic surgery and I am gonna look hot.  I will be reborn when I am older and get FFS (facial feminization surgery).  I know lots of mtfs who got ffs and after that they look totally different and pass better.  

I am such a clubgoer that I knew a lot of people.  Some people were making me really horny.  Some of those cute boys all nice and clean...well dressed and smelling good.  mmmmm  Speaking of cute boys, I hope Justin is doing ok.  I wish he was my husband so I could take care of him.  :monkey cry:  *sniff*  It'll never happen.  I wish he still had a LiveJournal, but he deleted it.  

So now this job is a perfect fit for me.  I love it.  But I just need a fulltime day job now.  It should be no problem.  I love having a job that is walking distance away.   Commuting sucks.  That is going to save me time and money.  

Life just slips away.  There is no rewind button on this motherfucker.  My childhood as a girl was stolen from me you could say.  Right now is being stolen from me because I don't look the way I want to.  I'm not doing the job I really want to.  But fuck it, appearances don't really reflect on what the person is like inside.  I just want to be an arist but I don't want to do it just for money.  Selling photographic prints is such a weird thing, especially in this digital age.  

I wonder what security level I should set this entry at.  really I should make it all friends only or private, but I guess I like to leave it open for strangers and friends who don't have a LJ to read.  I can only imagine how many times having this journal has worked against me.  But I am glad that LJ username, Graveyardgeisha gave me a code so I could have a free account.  I owe it all to her.  I love LiveJournal...until they make me pay, then I won't love it anymore, lol.  

amen     lol  

I have been on a typing rampage lately.  On my car club website I have been bombing the hell out of the boards with long ass posts.  I should be a typist.  

Somebody is on my fucking porch and I am ready to go out there and get them the fuck off it.  Ahhhhh, fuck it, it's not worth it.  Let them sit there.  I can just dump a bucket with hot water and bleach in it on the porch in the morning and that should get rid of their filth.  Probably some drunk gays boys sucking each other off.  Good times.  

I met like 100 people tonight.  I am so screwed.  I remember....let's see.....no names.  Yeahhh, nothing, lol.  Some faces I can't remember at all either, lol.  I am so screwed.  My memory, where did you go.  You know what is weird is that my intelligence is still the same, my IQ still feels the same, but my memory is toast.  

V and Alex were so drunk tonight.  lol  V is in love with a pretty Asian girl but I don't think the girl feels the same way.  Poor V.  She could date me if she wanted, but I guess I am too old for her.  Plus, dating roomates isn't always the best idea.  I would date V, but I don't think we would be that great of a match.  But right now V and I are homies so everything is really nice.  Speaking of roomates, I wonder if Shahin went to jail today.  My other roomie Gabino...I work with his bf.  His bf got me the job.  Very cool.  First job I tried to get after getting laid off and I got it.    

i hope Jill is ok since her grandma died, I should call her.  but she has her boyfriend so she doesn't need me.  *sniff sniff*  meh... I have too much love for too many people...weird.  very weird</small>"

I went shopping yesterday at Safeway and they had the best strawberries there.  Huge, sweet, and fresh.  I remember we used to grow strawberries and my brother and I would always be checking to see if there were any to eat.  It seemed we could never get enough.  At the checkout this one guy is always super sweet to me.  I am always happy when I get in his checkout line.  I am thinking of giving him my phone number actually.  He was telling me about how he grew up in Norway and that they had glacier water there and he would complain to his parents that he wanted tap water like everyone else.  He was saying he misses the glacier water now.    

I'm not procrastinating too much lately, but it is still pretty bad.  Oh, who am I fooling, I suck.  

Yesterday I went to my training for my new job and my boss was nowhere to be found.  Then I called him 20 times but his voicemail is full.  What a fucking hassle.  I need to make money so I am a little mad at him.  I don't know what's going on but I have had a lot of people give him messages for me so I should find out what's going on soon.  Honestly, I don't fucking care because it's just a security job, but whatever.

good news

Seems like the gay bar is interested in having me as a bouncer.  lol, my dad, the retired police officer will probably be proud.  I just won't tell him it's a gay bar, lol.  the bar has been talking about getting a female security guard so I guess I am their solution.  I think people have complained that there was no female security so perhaps I am the answer.

"event","Ugh, I am still pissed off about the whole Social Security gender thing with the EDD but I don't really care what they think of me so it doesn't really matter.  The fact is, to many people they will always consider me male because I am transsexual and there is nothing I can do about that.  Can't let it bother me.  Anyways, someone called from the EDD and he left me a message and he was using female pronouns, so I guess having a woman's name helps me.  Anywho.  People are starving all over the world, I can't let little things bother me.

Ok, so I had a big nigt last night.  Alex came over and he was hanging out with me and my roomate Veronica and then we all went to Badlands.  Then we all went to The Cafe.  Then we all went to The Mix to meet up with a guy I met that on Craigslist.  I posted an ad in the 'misc. romance' section looking for a man or a woman for love.  He is into motorcycles and he has a badass black bike that really reminds me of my car.  All the cheap plastic is removed and the bike is all steel and you can see all the nice aftermarket parts on it.  It's not chrome, except the exhaust, it just looks all black and tough like The Terminator would be driving it, lol.  Or maybe somebody from Mad Max.  So his name is Joey and he lives in the Mission, not too far from me.  We had a nice time.  Veronica's friend Cindy came with us, she is a cute butch/femme lesbian Thai girl.  She's a femme top who dresses in a lot of boy clothes.  Well, maybe you sort of get the idea.  lol  Cindy has a RSX-S/dc5, Veronica has a TSX and I have a ep3.  All three cars use Honda K-Series motors so that was cool.  We were the K series girls.  I kept making Special K references.  lol  Cindy likes to talk about cars so that was really cool.  Her car is modified a bit and she says she loves mine.  Yay!  Somebody else besides me actually like the hamster bodystyle.  I tried to make a pass at Cindy, but she was not biting.  I think she just loves to eat pussy so I gave up.  I don't think she would go for a MTF.  If she knew how submuissive I could be for her maybe she would change her mind.  lol  Or maybe not.  Who knows.

So anyways, Joey was the perfect gentleman.  He gives me butterflies.  I prefer him so much over my ex-girlfriend.  We can actually talk about stuff.  Like if I mention The East Bay Ratz, an East Bay motorcycle crew, he knows who I'm talking about.  If I mention different race tracks he knows what I am talking about.  And he knows all about the power to weight ratio as it relates to vehicle speed so yeah...he is exactly what I need for a boyfriend.  He is totally straight acting and he is bald.  He is half an inch taller than me.  He seemed kind of out of place in the gay bar in his armored leather motorcycle jacket but he has no issues with gay people, he was having tons of fun with my friends.  I made sure to bring my friends incase he was a psychopath.  I like to get more than one opinion on a stranger before I start to trust them.  Anyways.  ""Anyways""  ...I wonder if saying anyways all the time is a California thing.  I know we say 'hella' more than anywhere else in the world. 

I woke up and was afraid to get out of bed.  I was so fucking hung-over.  I wanted Advil so bad but I had none.  So I chugged a lot of water then I laid there in bed for at least an hour until I felt a little better.  then I went out to get breakfast.  Some guy at Starbucks had a baby Great Dane.  Puppy.  10 months old.  A photographer doing a book on San Francisco dogs took a pic of the dog.  He saw a woman'w camera that isn't even half as good as mine and he said, 'wow, what a nice camera.'  I guess half of being a photographer is having a big impressive camera.  The world is so patriarichal.  lol"

Where it syas gender on the unemployment application forms I put female for gender and I bet that raised a flag with Social Security because since The Patriot Act they have become the gender police.  Now I have to go to Social Security to get a printout proving who I am and I it will sale male on it.  I begged them to change it many times but no luck with a letter from a doctor proving you had surgery.  I am almost considering forging one of those letters.  I have been red flagged like this before by Social Security because of the gender thing and it fucking sucks.  My driver's license says that I am female and I want to be treated as a woman so I don't want to put down male on any forms.  Fucking sucks.  

I am in a dilema.  Stop smoking pot or keep smoking.  I smoke pot for lifelong stomach problems so I don't want to stop.  It's the only thing that really helps my stomach fast.  So many jobs drug test. what a hassle.  Guess I am going to sell my comic books today and apply for some jobs if i get my new resume done.  If I stop smoking pot then I can work at the Post Office or as a police officer.  I just need a job to pay the bills, I don't care much what right now.  I am considering getting into commercial insurance.  I give up on photojournalism as a source of income.  As a part-time thing that doesn't bring in any money, sure, but not as a job.

"event","Last night I went to see the head of security at the Cafe for a job there as a bouncer.  He seemed to really like me.  But then I was talking to him and my very grippy kevlar shoes helped me slip and fall on the stairs right in front of him.  lol  But he laughed.  We'll see what happens.  A SFPD officer was there with them (the security) so they were acting super serious.  I guess the SFPD is sick of getting 911 calls so they make the club rent one SFPD officer who volunteers for O.T....paid by the nigtclub.  My dad, a retired cop, used to do the same thing working raves as a cop.  

Afterwards I went to Orphan Andy's Diner.  The waiter was totally flirting with me and the other guy there that I always laugh and joke with got jealous.  The waiter got me a job application and said he is going to put in a good word for me.  My friend from the SFSU school paper already works there.  I guess the waiter's name was ""Cory but my friends call me Crazy.""  Too skinny, too gay for me.  lol  When I took off my jacket and he saw how big my breasts were he stopped flirting with me then the other boy started flirting with me like crazy.  The other one is totally straight acting.  But he is too short and too young for me.  And his hair is too long and curly.  I know he wants to fuck me.  I am considering it.  He makes me laugh really hard.  I am just shallow about appearances.  I think I would regret it.  I dunno.  Think I'll just stick to girls.  It makes it easier to say ""no"" to him because I know he is flat broke.  lol

Ooo, Roy Orbison is singing on TV.  Cool.  Now I am eating leftovers that my brother made.  Damn he is a good cook.  If he wasn't my brother I would marry him.  lmao  sick  Justin and I am are IM-ing as usual.  mmmm, I gotta get this recipe from my brother.   

Today I was kind of productive (I think).  Threw out a lot of old duplicate photos from the 1990s and a lot of photos of Erick Padilla who won't talk to me cuz his girlfriend loves having sex with me.  Erick and I had so much fun, it's too bad to lose such a close friend.  But fuck it, I sm still friends with his ex-girlfriend Ericka, and that's what matters.  lol  *evil*  I found a couple photos of Mike ""Dream"" Francisco who got murdered in Oakland in 2000.  I am glad I found them.  One I took of him spraypainting underneath the city of Oakland and another is him and Minnie Mouse at Hilltop Mall.  I will send a lot of photos to his when he gets older and will appreciate them.  I know some of these pics he might not have.  Poor fucking kid, growing up with no father.  I would send him noney if I had more.  Hope he turns out ok.  

anyways...life...death....what's it matter right?  Oh, my friend Alex gave me flowers today.  They make my room smell so good.  He gave me a big kiss on the cheek too.  I am sure I could have gotten more but I don't wanna upset his boyfriend.  lol  I love getting flowers."

"event","This morning I woke up at 6:30AM after sleeping exactly 8 hours (at night).  Trying to get used to this whole sleeping days thing.  Was going to go to Starbucks but then changed my mind and went to 7-11 and got what I would usually get onto my way to work.  Sushi and a 24oz. Rockstar.  Then I was so hungry I was eating in my car and spilled soy sauce on my driver's seat.  Luckily the seats are black, but it still sucked.  I swear if I spill coffee on those seats you can't even see where it was spilled.  I love black interiors.  

So after that I went back home (a 30 second drive, lol).  Then I smoked pot until...1:30?  Forgot what else I did.  Must have been nothing.  I vaguely remember soap operas and basketball.  Then I went to my brother's house.

At my bro's house he helped me work on my car for awhile.  we couldn't get my brakes back together then a DIY (do it yourself) on ephatch.com saved our a$$.  I washed my car before the rain.  I knew it would rain, but it needed a wash. 
 
We test drove my car over to the Thai restaurant our friend Cindy owns.  She always cooks us something special to eat just how we like it.  I swear, Asian women always get to my heart through my stomach.  Pull on my strings like I'm a puppet, lol.  After eating I took my brother ""stunt driving"" around town just like when we were teenagers.  We were laughing so hard.  My brother kept asking me, ""How old are you?""  And I kept telling him to listen for the squeaking noise my wheel was making but we were laughing so hard and the tires were screeching anyways, so it was really funny.  I kept saying, ""Listen, listen...hahahahahaha.""  I did a few e-brake u-turns just for fun.  By the time we got home we pretty much had to run into the house just incase anybody was chasing or following us.      
  
Then my brother and I went to OSH Hardware because his wife wants a <a href=""http://www.tropicalgardening.com/Bougainvillea/BougainvilleaPages/bougainvillea1.html"">Bougainvillea.</a>  The ones they had looked sickly so we didn't get any.  On the way to Osh there was a car accident where a car went off the road.  my brother pulled over to see if they needed a firefighter to help but nobody was injured.  The female cop had her sirens on but didn't know it.  My brother told her to turn them off and she wasn't even aware that it was her sirens.  She thought it was somebody else.  

Then we went to Best Buy and my friend Omar from ephatch.com was there doing stereo instalations.  he is supposed to buy my passenger seat but he hasn't been able to sell his digital camera to get the money.  I guess his passenger seat must be pretty damaged.  We both have NHBP (nighthawk black pearl) ep3s (Civic Si 02-05).  I plan on getting new seats soon.  Maybe red, but probably black.  My brother wanted to buy a beer keg fridge to keep his beer cold.  $325 for the demo model and $599 for the new one.  It has a tap on the top to dispense the beer.  It's basically a bedroom fridge with a hole in the top for the hose.  What a ripoff.  I talked him out of it, which is a good thing, because his wife would have killed him.  I told him, ""You can't buy this because you will always want to keep it full of beer but that will be impossible to do all year and it will suck to have it when it's empty all the time, just taking up space.""  I had to pull him away from it.  He loves his beer.  earlier in the day we bought a keg of beer for his annual March madness party which will be on Saturday night.  Supposed to be a woman coming to the party who works at a laser hair removal place, so I am gonna try to get a discount thorugh her.  Wanna do some more laser, but I can't afford to do much right now.  

My bro cooked salmon and veggies in coconut milk.  My brother actually used to cook at the Nantucket restaurant in crockett with Mike Pritchard (Dirnt) the bassist from Green Day when we were in high school.  My brother is pretty good cook.  we had some good Pinot Noir and crappy Merlot.  reminded me of the movie Sideways.  Stephanie cooked brownies for desert!  I was so full though.  I love brownies.  Momma the cat missed me so bad.  She kept sitting on my lap purring.  She sees me so infrequently she must think that I am dead after awhile.  Poor girl.  She is so near death herself.  Gettin' old.  

So after pigging out at my brother's house I drove home.  It was so rainy outside and everybody was driving like drunks with their eyes shut.  Finally made it across the windy Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and through all the ugly and confusing construction zones.  well, not confusing to me, but nobody else seems to be able to tell what lane they are in because they are not used to the way the road is with all the bridge construction.  

I got home and drove down Catro Street.  the gayest street in San Francisco.  Ahhhh....home again.  Then I went around the corner and parked and who do I see but Michael.  He is such a sweetie.  he was waiting for Gabino, my roomate.  Michael used to date Alex, my former roomate.  Scandalous, isn't it?  lol  But Alex gave them his blessing and seems to have no problems with it.  So I told Michael about my layoff told him I need a job.  he told me to come by his work tonight.  He said I might be able to be a security guard with him at his job.  he works at the main gay nightclub here.  So that is where I am off to now.  Gonna walk over there.  It's about 5 minutes away.  Just hope it doesn't rain on my makeup.  I don't feel like carrying an umbrella into the nightclub.  I better bring a resume also.  I am going to wear my kevlar boots over there and wear all black...so I look tough.  lol."

"event","Can't believe that Stacey has been dead for two years.  We have no mutual friends that I keep in touch with so nobody told me.  I would have been told if I went by the photojournalism department, but I never go by there.  She had to keep dropping classes but she was trying so hard.  She struggled so hard.  Hard to believe that her convertible would be the end of her when it flipped over.  I hate covertibles!  Always have.  

I can't belive that Alex, my former roomate is HIV positive.  I just found out a couple days ago after my layoff.  I know it isn't a death sentence the way it used to be, but he is so sick and skinny.  He must qualify as having AIDS by now.  Fuck.  He said he wished death would come sooner.  My other roomate has Multiple Sclerosis and she is a mess too.  

This world is fucked.  We are basically big ants.  We are a lot weaker thsan ants physically (for our size) but we are a lot smarter, so we think we are special.  Well....obviously we're not that smart.  

The world is very overpopulated so people need to die.  Just wish it wasn't my friends.  Ultimately there is no meaning to life.  I guess that makes life easier as long as you aren't searching for meaning where there is none.  Only things I believe in are being kind to others and helping each other to have better lives.  That's all I can think of right now.  

I know I will be ok.  I have a very strong inner strength to continue living...to continue smiling.  I have to carry on for all the righteous people that died.  

I remember Stacey and I and her friend snuck into the USF law lirary to do our SFSU journalism law homework assignment.  lol  I remember Stacey always having the best green bud.  Always better than mine, lol.  

I want to save this journal and delete all the old stuff.  Clean it up and go for a new look.  Nobody reads it except me anyways."

"event","Ugh, my friend I met at school died.  I can't believe it.  Looks like it happenned two years ago.  Seems like I just talked to her.  Granted, I have no concept of time...  We used to smoke buds at school.  lol  She was in the photojournalism program with me.  I think she liked me, definitely as friends, maybe as more.  I liked her too, she was so pure.  She had the wildest dreadlocks.  They were down to her ass and multicolor.  Can't believe this.  She was a few years younger than me.  Stacey was really popular with all the right people.  I remember she was having such a hard time at SFSU taking all the classes.  We were always happy if we had a class together because we could help each other.  I remember when I changed my name when I was going to SFSU and I told her my new name and she was so cool about it.  Ugh.  She was the most perfect person that there could be.  Life is so random.  Trying to make sense of anything is a joke/waste of time.  I need to take a shower.  R.I.P.  Stacey Doukas.  This bowl's for you.  Wish you were here to hit this shit but I bet they have better weed where you are.  lol  I was wondering why she hadn't called me in so long and now I know why.  My cellphone was stolen so I was unable to call her.  A lot of my friends have died before but this death really has inspired me to follow my goals, be strong and finish school.

"event","Well, I went to the Ritz-Carlton by my old apartment for afternoon tea.  It was in celebration of Jill's birthday.  Oh my darling Jill.  How it breaks my heart to see you with Carlos and not with me.  :(  lol   *sniff*

Jill brought her fucking Chihuahua (sp) to the Ritz.  LOL  The doggie was so cute and she kept it in a big purse.  I was afraid that we were going to get kicked out because of Jill's doggie.  lol  We had a nice tea.  The mango tea was the best.  Whoever came up with the idea of using stale bread to make the sandwiches is a genius, they must save a lot of money using stale bread.  lol  Jill said the day old bread is firmer than soft bread so it works better for little sandwisches wif the crust cut off.  Here you think you are going to get something fancy at the Ritz and they give you some stale bread and cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches.  lol  It was fun anyways.  The harp player was dope.

Jill's friend Theresa is so hot.  She is mostly Phillipino but part Chinese and Portugese also.  A very exotic combination.  She is nice and dark with very feminine features.  (Why I always have a crush on str8 girls, I will never know...I like to suffer!)  I wish she was single because we would be such a cute couple and I feel that we really click together.  *sob*  LOL.  I totally flirted with her in Tagalog and she said she wants to hang out in the Castro with me soon.  So I have a chance to steal her away.  *evil grin*  But I'm not going to hold my breath because she is in a relationship and identifies as straight as far as I know.  But I have been known to change that.  *modest*  Anyways, she is in love with my brother.  She seems sad that my little brother is married.  I told her that he doesn't like Asian women anyways.  I don't know why, but he has no attraction to Asian women.  It's weird, for me I love Asian women but I have little attraction to white women.    

I was running so late to the tea I am so glad I made it without being too late.  Jill's friends are really cool.  I kept calling Jill ""Paris"" because of her carrying her little doggie.  lol  Can't believe she got away with bringing the dog into the dining room.  lol  Jill reminded me that I have pictures of her on E at a club where her legs are spread and she has no panties on and you can see, well, everything.  lol  Then I said, ""Note to self:  look through my photo archives.""  And everyone laughed.  Fuck I am funny.  I only hope I didn't say too many crazy things.  Jenn Pren wasn't there so somebody else had to make some bizarre/sexual statements.  

I sold my body kit for my car.  I haven't been getting a lot of hours at work so I need the cash.  I spent three hours today cleaning my car.  I am really enjoying how the car looks WITHOUT the kit.  The guy that took it off was buying it for his friend and he is a Acura technician so he did a good job.  His name was Huy and he works at the Elk Grove Acura and he is so fucking hot.  I don't think he liked me which is too bad because I really liked him.  *licks her lips*  Glen told me it is obvious I need a boyfriend, not a girlfirend.  I'm not sure if he is right or wrong.  Being bisexual is like being a person of mixed races.  It's not easy.  I should know because I am German/Swiss/Irish/whatever else.  I really wish I was 100% German or 100% something.  I hate being a mutt.  But I look hot, so who cares, that's all that matters.  Plus I am fucking genius...so I got that going for me.  LOL  

I am removing all the sideskirt adhesives from the car to prep it for bodywork.  There was like 30 pieces of automotive adhesive on each sideskirt.  I ripped the skin on my left thumb while rubbing the adhesive off.  I am considering painting the bottom half of the car Milano Red and the top half, keeping it black.  Doing a gradual fade from top to bottom.  That way I can get a CTR bodykit in Milano Red if I want to.  Does that sound good Justin...my love?  lol  Time will tell.  Time will tell."

"event","A couple nights ago I went drinking with Madeline and two of her friends.  Her fiends are lesbians and they live in Oakland.  We gave them a ride home after we went to the Summer Place on Bush Street that is right across the street from my old apartment.  People were actually smoking inside of the bar.  There were a couple cute Chinese girls I wanted to talk to but by the time I drank enough to have any courage they had already left.  Why I am always attracted to straight Asian girls, I have no idea.  

When we went to Oakland we went to the liquor store when we got there.  What a colorful place.  In the liquor store there were about five transsexual and transvestite prostitutes and one of them was in her bra and panties.  I was a little bit shocked.  A couple of them were hot but a couple looked tore up.  You know in neighborhoods where most people are African American nobody ever gave me shit about being a transsexual.  Just sometimes way back in past years before hormones Black girls have looked at me and then said to their friend or to themself, ""I don't know what I'm dealin' with.""  

Anywho.  So Maddy Yaya and Jeanette and I were at Carl's Jr. because no other place was open to eat in the area there was a fuckin' pimp in there.  He had on a pimp hat and a long leather jacket.  he didn't even come into Carl's Jr. to eat he was just just checking us out.  What a weirdo.  I think he should be arrested right away for that shit.  Nothing positive about that.  So many hookers there.  Some white girl had her name tattooed on her neck really big in curly handwriting.  Maybe her pimp put it there.  She must be the submissive type.  lol  Oakland seems like a total warzone/mess to me.  But I have always had great marijuana in Oakland.  Yaya had some yummy bomb.  Maddy and i got lost on the way back.  I always get lost in Oakland.  Seems like there are tons of freeway offramps but no freeway onramps.  

It's always fun drinking with Madeline.  I wish I didn't work nights so I could kick it with her and the girls more. 

 It's 7pm and I am going to take a nap before work.  I worked a 13+ hour shift at my second job last night.  At least nobody screamed at me for smoking pot loutside like last week.  I was laughing my ass off at work last night.  Everything was so funny.  

A found two places to work on my car for almost nothing so I am happy about that.  Got some Hawk brake pads, motor mount inserts a short shift kit sway bar/tie bar and some other stuff.  

My week long vacation is over now.  It was pretty good.  Sucks that it is over."

I am kind of shocked how fast I gained weight.  I am keeping it under control before it gets out of hand.  I blame the weight gain on cheese binges before bedtime, the fact that I am not parking my car up the hill lately and also on the Internet.  

Chipping away at my sound-deadening material in my car this morning.  Make some progress and I now I am finding out how heavy that stuff really is.  I am so glad I am removing it.  What satisfaction.  I put a new emblem on my car today.  It says EURO R on the back now.  I got it from Honda of Japan...it's the emblem for the Honda Accord Euro-R in Japan, known in the USA as the Acura TSX.  Not that anyone will know that, probably not even my Japanese friends.  So now my car has a H emblem on the back for Honda and a EURO R emblem.  The emblem looks 100% stock.  I bet I fool a lot of people.  

I have a car club meet tonight in Daly City.  We are going to talk about supercharger pulley sizes, Hondata and they are going to make fun of my pink windows.  Should be fun.

Going to sell the headliner to somebody in my group.  Should be doing other stuff.  That's it, I am getting off the Internet.  My soup is getting cold here as I type this.

"event","One hour ago today and I am driving home.  I saw this Evo with California ""WRXKILR"" license plates.  Looked like a 2004 Evo and it had a pretty huge chrome exhaust and tinted windows.  It was bright yellow, a beautiful car.  I thought to myself, I am gonna race this Evo.  So he was going a different way than I was but I went that anyways cuz I wanted to race an Evo.  

I could not believe it.  I chased him and there we were at a stoplight on Army Street.  lol  I revved at him.  And I was shocked when he revved back.  It was on.  I was going to race an Evo.  My heart started to race.  I revved my car until my tach was at about 4,500 RPM and kept it there.  When the light turned green I let the clutch out smooth and let the car go all the way to 7,500 RPMs.  I never do that, it was so loud.  Usually I try not to go higher than 7,000 rpms for the sake of my engine.  Our cars screamed and we spun a bit because it was raining out.  Before you know it we are flying.  

I was keeping up with the Evo, I couldn't believe it.  He beat me but not even by the length of his car.  At the next light he put his hands in the air like he wasn't even trying as if to say, ""That's all you got?""  I was laughing my ass off.  I gave him a friendly double honk and he honked back.  It was better than sex, lol.  I love racing.  

Oh I forgot to put this kill in my journal.  I was driving down Army the other direction night before last, going to work.  I see a blue ep3 on Army and I thought ""tight, one of my crew members.""  I am not sure who it was, but probably somebody from my car club website.  It seems anyone with a  modified ep3 is a member in the Bay Area.  I didn't get a good look at the car because I was running really late to work.  really late, and my boss warned me not to be late or I will lose my job.  I think it was my friend with a supercharger or another guy who has a pretty stock ep3 because it looked like their cars.  

So when I got on the freeway I went to the fast lane at top speed and just hauled ass because I was running very late.  The vivid blue pearl ep3 must have thought that I wanted to race him.  I was just driving to work at 100 MPH and he was keeping up with me.  So I decided since I was running late to work anyways, why not go crazy.  I ditched his ass.  I am gonna go look and check my mail to see if it was anyopne I know.  Gonna see those two guys with VBPs tomorrow and ask if it was one of them.  If it was kuya, then I beat a supercharged ep3.  lol"

Trying to improve my horsepower to weight ratio and there is a big difference in feeling once you gut it.  Once I removed the rear seat I felt like I was in a go kart all of a sudden.  The back felt like a passenger just hopped out once it was gutted.  I removed all emblems and stickers in preparation for some body work and paint.  I might go fuchsia glitter and black or a flat black paint job.  Hard to decide.  I park on the street so I don't want to get player hated or robbed on.

I have a lot of things to do that I am dreading doing, but I have to do them.  But if I died today it wouldn't matter if I did them or not.  Yes, we all die.  Yes, the clock is ticking.  Yes, I am 32 now and I can't go back.  

I put an ephatch.com sticker on my car.  I love it.  This one girl at work is so cute, and I like her a lot...ok, I lust after her, but she has a girlfriend right now.  damn.  I wish she was a hooker cuz I want her so bad I would pay.  I think she is gonna marry her girlfriend so I have no chance.  But, I bet if I slept with her afterwards I would say to myself, ""That was fun, but I still need a boyfriend.""  lol, being bisexual sucks."

"event","I have a super sore throat.  Can barely talk.  Not feeling that great.  Maybe too much smoking combined with not enough sleep.  Lately I haven't been sleeping much at all.    

Here's a couple photos of my car's new pink window tint.

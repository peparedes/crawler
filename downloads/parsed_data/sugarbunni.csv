"event","I was walking my dog thru a park in downtown Oakland and this fella in a big silver pick up truck pulls up and jumps out and asks me where the nearest hospital is.&nbsp; I tell him Highland and give him general directions and ask if he's ok, or does he need an ambulance?&nbsp; I also mention that if he's got insurance Alta Bates is a better bet although farther away.&nbsp; He says he doesn't think he needs an ambulance, he thinks he can get himself there and then proceeds to tell me what's wrong.&nbsp; 

He said that he was playing basketball with some buddies earlier and got hit in the scrotum really hard and now had intense pain and swelling.&nbsp; He looked like he was genuinely in pain and kept repeating how embarassed he was.&nbsp; I told him maybe he had a hernia or something.&nbsp; He kept asking me what he should do.&nbsp; I told him that personally, I would go home and put some ice on it. &nbsp;He said he lived in SF.&nbsp; I told him he'd be better off getting home and then if he did need to go to the hospital he could go to one in SF closer to his home, so long as the pain wasn't so bad he could still drive.&nbsp; He told me his scrotum was swelled to about twice the size as normal and asked me if it was noticable (while repeating how embarassed he was).&nbsp; I told him it wasn't noticable and I would have never known had he not told me his perdickiment.&nbsp; He thanked me for the advice and then went on his way.&nbsp; 

Now, what the fuck?&nbsp; Was this a total April Fools Day joke or what?&nbsp; He never let on that it was a joke and, like I said, the guy looked like he was in a fair amount of pain.&nbsp; I thought it seemed fishy when he asked me if it was noticable, as if it was all an elaborate rouse to get me to look in the general direction of his junk. &nbsp;But, it's not like he flashed me or did anything pervy.&nbsp; If it wasn't a joke it was sure the weirdest encounter I've had on the street in quite some time.&nbsp; And if it was a joke then he's a damn good actor, but has a lame sense of humor because there was no punchline.

Weirdness.&nbsp; Although, I suppose it's better than what happend today to me today on the street while walking my dogs.&nbsp; I accidently saw a bum pooping.&nbsp; gross.&nbsp; 

Never a dull moment in Oakland!"

It's things that like that make me unsure of how he really feels about me.&nbsp; Which, considering we've been together almost 3 years, sucks.

Maybe I'm just insecure.&nbsp; Although, I never felt insecure when I was alone."

Ahhh retrograde... 

Thank god a friend pointed it out to me, because, once again, I didn't see it coming and thought I was going mad.  Nope.  Just mercury fucking with everything.  It helps me to understand this.  I have more patience with communication and dealing with my fellow monkeys.

"event","It amazes me how when my life is good I totally neglect my LJ.  I guess if things are going well I'm too busy enjoying life to reflect on it.  I do feel truly blessed these days.  Sure, I still have problems, but mostly, things are well.  

I seem to be unaffected by the financial crisis hitting the nation.  I suppose things gotta get pretty dire before folks stop drinking (I'm a bartender).  Of course, I haven't been able to save a dime, but at least bills are paid and there's money in my pocket to go out to lunchies!  I hope when I'm an old lady I don't regret the amount of $ I spend on lunch now, but I just love going out to eat!

I have a car now.  It's my dad's old Toyota Camry.  It sat undriven for about 2 or 3 years and fired right up after a jump start!  I had my mechanic give it the works and it's been running like a dream.  Yay!  I even have a driver's license to boot!  

I love Trey so much.  I think his influence is partially responsible for me getting some of my shit together (like my license).  Our life together is pretty sweet.  He got rid of his storage unit over the summer so all of our things are mingled now and they go well together, just like us... awwwww!  

It's been a few weeks since Burningman and I think Trey and I are due for another adventure, maybe sailing in a week or so.  I bought him a nice river raft for his birthday, but I think we're going to have to wait until spring to really break it in.  We took it out to Lake Pyramid before Burningman and paddled around.  Super fun, but we got super sunburnt, too.  Neither one of us burns very easily so we neglected to bring enough sunblock.  And after BM, we stopped and camped at Donner Lake.  We were a bit too worked to go out on the lake, but we went to the Donner Museum and watched the gnarly movie about the Donner Party.

OooOOooh!  That gives me an idea... wouldn't it be funny if someone threw a Donner Party?  Sure it's in poor taste, but then aren't all the bestest things?!?!?  Think of all the ""finger foods"" you could serve.  There's a lot of cannibal humor out there!  Cannibals... the new zombies."

Trey and I are leaving for Burningman next Fri.  I think it's gonna be a nice year.  Although, I'm almost looking more forward to spending a day at Pyramid Lake than a week at BM!  I love that lake.  Thursday night Trey and I are hosting a party at Camp Zoom on the Esplanade.  If you have music in the format of cds or an ipod or laptop come on by and BRING IT!  I'm going to make a big 'ol vat of jungle juice for the occasion so come on by and have a cocktail with us!  Cheers!

Also, after the burn, on Sept. 6 I'm helping throw a SPAZ fundraiser for a friend who is fighting a custody battle for his child.  More details on that soon, but it will, of course, rock.

And, Sept. 30th is my next Ladies Night ""SKIRTS"" at Oasis.  The last one was a hoot and a half so you don't want to miss this next one cuz it'll prolly be even better!

Oh, and far into the future... Dec. 13th I'm planning the biggest event I've ever thrown, possible venue is Sweet's Ballroom (so you get an idea of how big this shit's gonna be!)

All in all,  I've been keeping busy, loving life, manifesting moolah, and always looking out for the next big adventure."

"event","I really just want the holidaze to go away this year.&nbsp; Normally, I feel very festive and hostess-ey around the daze.&nbsp; I've just been in a funk and happy memories of childhood christmas' keep flooding my mind.&nbsp; Holiday seasons when I had a family, a whole family.&nbsp; 

Christmas pretty much took a shit for me when my mom died.&nbsp; In fact, family took a shit for me when my mom died.&nbsp; My extended family had always seemed really close when I was growing up, but after my mom died (just when you think family would come together) it fell apart.&nbsp; My connection to aunts, uncles, and cousins dropped off into some sort of bottomless pity.&nbsp; My mom's been dead ten years.&nbsp; My brother has been dead 14 years.&nbsp; My life with them feels like some movie I saw a long time ago.&nbsp; My greatest fear after they died was that I would forget them, forget the sound of their voices, their smell, their idiosyncrasies.&nbsp; And, like most fears, it is realized.&nbsp; Only, I do still remember many of the details of who they were.&nbsp; What feels lost and forgotten to me is who I was.

After moving to California and seeing so many different ""community"" families coming together I think I must have felt touched and inspired and maybe a little hopeful that I could find a place for myself.&nbsp; But, after years of attempting to contribute and include myself here and there I remain feeling like an outsider.&nbsp; I think it's true, you can't go home again.&nbsp; I'll never have a family like I did.&nbsp; Sure, I'll have deep friendships, loves, and bonds with other people and communities, I may even reunite the energy I once had with my extended family, or start a family of my own someday, but I'll never again have the family feeling I grew up with.&nbsp; And, I feel as though it was taken from me before I was old enough to even appreciate it.

I totally digress from the point of this purge.... I hate christmas because once upon a time I loved it."

Also, feeling estranged from many of the social circles I once sought to include myself in.&nbsp; And, really, it's refreshingly liberating.&nbsp; I think what's actually happening here is a raising of the bar.&nbsp; My standards of community and of friends has been raised and as some don't make the cut others who are way more conducive to my progress as a human step up.&nbsp; It's quite the illuminating social experiment.

Boyfriend world is good, although when I work so much we don't get a lot of quality time together because of the differing schedules.&nbsp; His birthday is coming up.&nbsp; He doesn't seem to care about it too much, but I'm going to do my best to make it special.&nbsp; I also have a gift I'm getting him that I know he'll be stoked on.

All in all life is good.&nbsp; Transition is always a challenge I guess, but I do enjoy the newness it brings to things.

I've got an event coming up on Tuesday Aug. 14th at Oasis that I'm really excited about.&nbsp; The Mole and I are collaborating to bring the world ""Super-Happy-Fun-Time-Amusement-Extravaganza!!!""

Stay tuned for more super-fun details on that!"

"event","Life is full of disappointments when you have expectations.&nbsp; 
But, how do you set goals for yourself if you don't visualize some sort of outcome and create an expectation?&nbsp; 
I suppose the key is to stay flexible, roll with the punches, etc.
Or, maybe it's just another crap lesson in suffering
Not that I'm not thankful, suffering is learning, yada, yada, yada...

Some part of me feels to accept disappointment is to admit failure
And who likes to do that?

As spontaneous as I like to fancy myself I'm annoyed when things don't go as planned

The lesson I'm taking away is to re-focus my energies inward."

"event","We didn't break up.
We talked it out.
He said he was sorry and didn't mean it.
He said that he loved me. 
(which is the first time I've heard it from him).
Not exactly the circumstances under which I was hoping to hear it.
But, o-well.

The pain of his original statement still lives in my mind.
But, part of me thinks it was some sort of test.
Deep down I know that he would be hurt if I was with someone else, 
just as I would be if he was unfaithful.

Relationships are hard work.
That's the moral of this story.
I used to think that it was all in the hands of fate
to deliver your perfect mate to you.
Now I realize it's up to you
to invest your time, energy, and love
into someone.
And, to not give up on things too soon,
I suppose."

My boyfriend tells me he doesn't&nbsp; care if I fuck other people.
I don't think I can be with him now.
There has been an imbalance I've been ignoring for sometime.
It's not that I think he wants to be with other people.
I do trust him.
But, if he doesn't care enough to want me in the same way, 
I just can't do this.

I want monogomy.
One on one love.
I want love.
True love.
Deep love.
Love that can express itself.

I'm sick with the thought of him leaving, 
but , I suppose it's a familiar sickness, 
so, I can take it.
I love him.
But, I realize I don't always love people who are good for me.

The thought of being on my own again is the only comfort.
I'm good alone.
Not so many moods.
Plenty of space.

I suppose it's just one uncomfortable conversation away now."

And now, I get the lovely bay area pleasure of explaining my judgement to said friend through e-mail.&nbsp; Geezus!!!&nbsp; Am I acutally expected to apologize for being ""negative and judgemental"" over this?&nbsp; I can tell what my friend would like to hear is that I'm sorry I was a bummer and I don't judge her as a person for those actions and to each his/her own...&nbsp; But, that would be a big fat lie.&nbsp; I have very strong opinions and jugements about heroin and crack.&nbsp; Namely, I don't associate with anyone who does either.&nbsp; No thanks, I've got too many dead friends already from heroin and if I wanted to hang out with people who smoke crack I would simply walk to my nearest neighborhood corner.

It's not that I feel I can't be friends with her anymore.&nbsp; But, I already know I don't feel safe partying with her (especially late at night) now.&nbsp; I'm still just so shocked that those drugs were casually brought out.&nbsp; I'm posting this in an effort to clear my thoughts and absorb what happened so that I can reply to her e-mail.&nbsp; I still don't know what to say to her tho.&nbsp; All that comes into my mind is the truth, which, I'm sure, will sound just as bad as it did on the night in question when I seemed ""negative and judgemental"".&nbsp;

"event","Oi, to sum it up in a jewish manner.

Its 7:44, apparently I missed church due to anger/sleep needs.
I get home from rivergate and dropping Josh off when mom follows me into my room while im on the effin toilet seat, and goes on about the phone bill. Im sorry about the Lebanon calls, if you guys would just get the package where its only like 10 dollars a month for unlimited long distance, I wouldnt have gone over, My fault. I mean Im sorry about that, but then to make matters worse she pratically accuses me for making a phone call to New York. Camden? Camly? Connelly? I just remember a C. When in all reality as at lack of a real mind as my mother is, she probably called there and forgot, or my dad did it and just wants me to catch the slack for it. Same with when things go missing. Katie have you seen, Katie did you move, Katie wheres my...blah blah blah. Find it your own damn self woman, you moved it. She can be so sweet sometimes, but man when she's on a rampage. Look Out. Dad was probably smirking as he sat listening. THEN THEN she accuses me of sleeping with Josh last night. ( he stayed because his mom pretty much kicked him out and he didnt have anywhere to stay) anyway, when he CLEARLY slept on the couch and I CLEARLY slept all ALONE in my bed... Erg. I sneeze up blood, you think I want anyone sleeping with me? For 2. Also, I learned my lesson back when I was 16. I have no desire to piss my parents off further with a boy in my bed house. Oi. But that doesnt really matter to them. For all they notice, Im some heathen child with no respect for anything or anyone, going where i please, doing what I please without ever telling them, then they come on here and read about my life, but never acctually effin bother to ask me, and if they do they wouldnt freakin believe me. Apparently im satan, reincarnate.

Two Interview's so far, amazing when you're not really looking, they all get thrown at you. Pac Sun called yesturday, Then I have another one at walmart at 2 Tuesday. Yay, now I can hopefully get myself out of here. At first I thought about it and wanted to stay until I got done with my second year of dental, but right now, I'm mentally packing my bags till I have money enough to get out. But Im not going to even talk about that right now.

I wanted to go to church tonight. I woke up at 7:44. Dah. Church doesnt even belong in this entry. Im too mad right now."

When you are out of school you are out of 'THE LOOP'.
Anyway. I need 8 people or more this summer who are interested in a road trip to Destin Florida, My uncle has a condo and I asked him about prices and as long as we go sometime other than spring break its not bad at all maybe 100 a person. So if anyone wants to go down there and make some fun stops on the way and spend a nice week on the beach, then let me know.

I feel gross this morning, I cant breathe. I really wanna go to church tonight but Im not gonna go if I have to blow my nose every 6 seconds. That is gross. Im even sneezing BLOOD.
Ha okay. Im sure everyone is happy now.

Um, josh update.
Told me he went out with Tim from the Discount Tobbacco outlet, and Mario the security guy, come to find out he went out with Chrystal the athiest whore metal head. Yeah, my total opposite, but maybe thats what he's going for.
Im just keeping my head up and waiting for my PRINCE CHARMING. Yay, im excited. Im like a kid waiting to recieve a gift in the mail, because I know it's just for me and already been sent all I have to do is wait and recieve it. :O) yay again.
Speaking of packages, I am expecting Grandma's old jewelry soon. Yippe. No she's not dead, she's in the loony bin so I get her neat jewelry. Woop.

Second note.
The  Passion is out today. I really want to go see it tonight but the way I understand it is that its sold out for the next two weeks. Bleh. Well we'll see."

 The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, ""You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level. You are 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49..09 minutes west longitude.

""I am,"" replied the man. ""How did you know?""

 

""Well,"" answered the balloonist, ""everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of       your information, and I'm still lost.. Frankly, you've not been much help to me.""

 

The man smiled and responded, ""You must be a Democrat.""

 

""I am,"" replied the balloonist. ""How did you know?""

 

""Well,"" said the man, ""you don't know where you are or where you're going. You've risen to where you are due to a large       quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect ME to solve your problem. You're in EXACTLY the same position you were in before we met, but somehow now, it's MY fault."

Had fun last night, hung out with abe and michael. Played Pool. Um, got sick last night and went home early this morning because I was near dead, slept the majority of the day, took alot of pills.
My dad is an ass...
Yeah your normal wonderful day.

He gets MAD at me because I finally got an interview, supposedly someone from his church said something to the hiring manager. Thats fine and dadny, but what the hell, yeah yell at me for it. He is effin retarded. Yeah way to be happy for me dad, im finally gonna be out of your hair and your mad at me. Shows how much you effin care. Then mom and him both get on to me for renting ""Rules of Attraction"" and a movie called ""Thirteen"" which is an independant film about a mother and her daughter going through her teenage years. Its a story about true life and the human spirit. Sure it has cuss words in it, but not like dad doesnt own movies like that. Hypocrites. Mom reads those dirty books, like white oleander was 80% sex and drug related crap, but yet if I watch them say the cuss words, its different than reading it. Yeah not like im 18 and can make decisions on my own. For once I wish they'd freakin realize this. Here I am sick as crap and they yell at me. Screw you guys. Gr.

Ha abe is mad at josh because of josh being a butt, woo. He said he'd get stuff out of him for me. I love abe, he is really cool. I got the wrong impression from what everone was saying about him but turns out he's pretty awesome. 
I also think its cool that friday night when i hung out with kendalyn and she told me about Andrews and her's relationship that I prayed that night God would show me if I was supposed to be with josh, then sure enough Saturday roles around and he breaks up with me. Im not really upset anymore, and wasnt really to begin with. Just hurt kinda. Then I get a job interview at walmart and thats perfect so that way I can have something to get my mind off of him. Now Im just waiting patiently for Mr. Right, because I believe God will come through for me. I've come to realize all i really have to do is ask sincerely and God comes through. Thats really cool. I wish God would make my parents stop being so stiff. I still get treated like I supposedly dont know left from right."

There is a man over fixing my bathtub. Yeeeah.

I need to do something, and stop sitting around like a pathetic loser, but im kinda lost all by myself. I was going to wash the car but im waiting for these guys to leave so I dont have to leave them alone in my room. Mom is gone to physical therapy so Im alone with him and craig the house guy. They just went out the door but i dunno if they are gone for sure or not. One thing for sure is that i really need to pee, but my bathroom is occupied. Dah.

Great day today. Josh came over with Mattie (My Dog) and we went to Mansker Creek Park and walked around the track and had a picnic. When you get tward the end there is a huge family of like 20 squirrels that all come up to you for food, its so freakin awesome. I love squirrels.
I sounded really weird just then.
I came home around 6 or so and cleaned out the gerbil room. Read a Letter Derek sent me from boot camp, got bored cleaned some more, got dad's camera and had a photo shoot, just simply because I could and I havnt done that since I was little and vain. Well I was never vain, but extremely concerned with how I looked. That was back in middle school though, so no worries. Hehe. Um, Posted on some communities because I could. Looked through Hot_Fashion and yeah here I sit eating some great jalapeno cheese dip from los compadres. I believe I'll go to bed on time tonight too. Im doing good.
Oh, and I dyed my hair finally like 2 days ago, for those of you who were agrivated with my yapping about it."

We went and talked to the Lawyer yesturday and he was awesome, he told us that quote unquote ""You're white, you're free, and you can do whatever the hell you want to"" Hehe, he was awesome. I expected an younger man, but he was bald and had little bits of white hair on the side and a funny mustache. It was just great. He told us that this was a ""Mickey Mouse"" case and that its nothing to worry about. I will probably just end up with court costs (about 150 bucks) and pre trial diversion, which means that after a year my record will be ""esponged"" hehe.. meaning completely whiped free except for like an ""FBI"" number or something. Wonderful. He even told me if i ever needed a Lawyer the most he would charge me would be 750 bucks. Wooha. Which isnt bad considering most of the time those kind of things are thousands of dollars. Im also glad he told me I could hang out with Kristy again. I get lonely otherwise because everyone else is in school and im all alone. But now Im not, so yay.

Yesturday after the Lawyer we went to the sherrif's dpt. to get my application for a public defender, which i will go turn in tomorrow. Then we went back to her house where we found that Julie Kate ( a girl that used to like josh and he almost cheated on me with) Had been calling Josh and steven, and also they emailed them both this horridly whorish picture of her and another girl making out. Yes, she deffinatly is still on drugs. Anywho. Apparently the other night the guys had met up with them and told us all they did was drive around all night, which was hard to believe in the first place, but then the dumbasses just omit that they ever met up with Julie and this chick Krystal, and when we confronted them they lied.
Why do men feel the need to lie even if they'd get in less trouble if they just told the truth? I mean we didnt really care if they did stuff with the whores, but lying about it is a different matter. Im pretty mad, but I really dont care right now. I feel im at a point in my life where stupid guy stuff isnt quite as important as it once was. Plus there is a certain someone, maybe out of my league, but just the thought that they are there gives me an odd sort of hope that everything will be fine if another josh thing happens again. Thats a different story though. 

My car didnt start today, really couldnt tell you why. We tried to jump it off but the battery was so dead it wouldnt even make a noise or try to start. So I got the jeep today, yay. I still feel sorry for my poor babylove. Poor neon. Eh, its just a battery. Went to the DTO to talk to tim, then came back here while im waiting for Kristy to finish practicing piano. Im tempted to get up this instant and start cleaning her room... Eek. Hehe, i love you :O)

Well kiddie-o's im off to play with the gerbies.

Yeaaah. I had an okay day today, I am a bit tired because I had to get up early, but I napped so Im alright. Josh randomly showed up at my house this morning so I went out with him. We went four wheeling and to a park, then to the mall and talked to Galen about his neato Jeep that was on TRUCKS! If you've ever seen that show on Spike tv. It was really awesome. Yeah, so Josh has a new mudding buddy now. How cute.

I am really hoping today will be alot better. I woke up this morning to a wet sopping nasty gerbil cage because Hunny the spaz, is as before mentioned, a spaz, and chewed holes in the side of it causing all the water to leak into the cage. Gerbils can be such dumb creatures, but come to think of it, she is the only one that does that. I should just give her a big mental kick. I hope her babie's dont turn out that stupid, all like 6 billion of them... Dah. So I have to clean out stinky gerbil cage at 8 in the morning. Oh how life loves me. Indeed. I can only say that when a bad day is headed tward you, it usually starts in the morning, except on the occasions when it wants to catch you off gaurd and beat you in the face like a mo' fo. Yeah, please dont be a bad day. I think I am just going to come home after the doctor and sleep. You really cant get into any trouble sleeping. Im tired anyway and need to catch up on my ""zz's"" shall we call them.

Well children, Im off to take mummy to the doctor to get her stitches out. I've come to realize I cant go a period of two weeks without having to go to some kind of doctor, whether it be mine or someone else's.

"event","okay, good day, bad night.
The day started out wonderfully, I got to spend some time with my loverly Malorie, we went to Sally's and got purple hair dye, then Walmart, then Target. I love Target. Anyway. We came back with some lovely Boxers for Justin's Vday gift and hair dye. ooh La la.
We went back to malories and dyed it, it came out very lovely except the purple completely washed out. I knew that brand sucked but the woman at the counter said it was okay in the darker colors... Im slightly perterbed. I will deffinatly not let anyone buy that crap again. I knew Manic Panic was better... I feel slumpy. Yeah anywho.

Missed The little Drama thing at church, but thats okay. Went and got there late cause I had to get gas, but that was okay too. The service was good and I enjoyed it, we're having like a mission theme or something. Church lets out, and here we go, as always to los compadres. I really do not like going there every freakin sunday and wednesday but I ride along non the less because I wanted to go goof off. 
We get there and honestly I dont know where to start or how it even happened. First let me explain that there is this girl, Kristen Guilder. She is 15, the former youth pastor/now music minister's daughter. She is stuck up, arrogant, rude, self centered and every unpleasant thing you can think of. Im really not exagerating, which is sad.
Moving on.
She didnt go with us because she was supposedly ""grounded"" so okay we all leave. Then about 10 minutes into the meal she calls michael's phone yelling about not being invited, yadda yadda, litteral yelling. He tells her that until he can hear her through the screams, he will talk to her later and hangs up. She repeditivly calls and they keep hanging up on her. I had no knowledge of this because I was at the other table the whole time with Josh and Kristy. Then suddenly Scott gets a call and its Mrs. Beverly, she demands to speak to me, Even scott tells her I had nothing to do with this. Then she yells at me for not answering my phone, and goes on about how she's tired of me ""treating her daughter like this"" and I dont even know what she said but she went on yelling at me. I got mad and was like listen lady, ""your daughter is disrespectful, she caused problems and was loud and rude to people sitting near us last week and we dont think she should come out with us until she learns her manners and how to behave"" I said it nicely and then the ""nice christian woman"" turns into a mean horrid evil bitch and calls me all these things and says im a ""witch"" and blah blah. I dont cry often but the music ministers wife calling you names really hurts. So I hung up on her and turn to josh and start crying and then josh blows up and calls her and just it was a mess. I really am not looking forward to putting up with this crap wed. Oh goody. You know, I really hope they leave. The less hypocracy/bitchocracy in the church the better. Urg, pardon my language but im just mad. I get blamed for freakin everything weather I do it or not.
Balls (non litteral) Both my blessing and my curse.
Some people say they wish they had the courage and balls I have, but then again they dont see this side of them. Heh that sounded funny."

Pat was so funny, and then the goof balls down in booking were as humored as I was with this whole situation. I was smiling the whole time and cutting up with them. I wanted to have a big grin in my mug shot but the second i relaxed, the took the picture. Shucks. The fingerprint machine was like a big game, and everyone was real nice. I wasnt in the least intimidated. Except by one of the drunk guys in a holding tank, he kept staring out the window at me... creeepy...

Had a good Valentines day, Josh took me to see 50 First Dates, and to dinner. He got me a bunch of candy for Valentines day. He's trying to make me fatter, I swear. Um.
Yeah. Everyone go see 50 first dates, its so great.

Jake Andrews called me. Im in complete and total shock. I didnt think he would. Weird.

Well Im off to go dye malowee's hair and spend some quality bonding time with her. Josh wanted to do stuff, but he has done stuff with me this whole week and I need to do stuff with my dear malorie, So I told him I had plans. He acctually didnt get too pouty which is good.

What a wonderful way to explain Heaven.
 A sick man turned to his doctor, as he was preparing to leave the examination room and said, ""Doctor, I am afraid to die.
Tell me what lies on the other side.""
Very quietly, the doctor said, ""I don't know.""
""You don't know?  You, a Christian man, do not know what is on the other side?""
The doctor was holding the handle of the door; on the other side of which came a sound of scratching and whining, and as he opened the door, a dog sprang into the room and leaped on him with an eager show of gladness.
Turning to the patient, the doctor said, ""Did you notice my dog?  He's never been in this room before.  He didn't know what was inside.
He knew nothing except that his master was here, and when the door opened, he sprang in without fear.  I know little of what is on the other side of death, but I do know one thing...
I know my Master is there and that is enough."""

Im getting somewhat agrivated with my parents. They've always been supportive and great but the second i really need their help, they disown me. I just suggested to them that I would like to go talk to a lawyer about this whole thing and they thought I was going to jail or something. Dad even told me bluntly if I went to jail, he wouldnt bail me out. Man, even kristy's freakin spazmatic excuse for a mother is helping her, yet my parents, the ones everyone likes and the reason everyone comes to my house, disown me. The poor pennyless excuse for a criminal daughter. Apparently im on the same scale as a murderer or theif in their books even though I did nothing but commit a misdemeanor of ""Prank calling"" Damn our sad excuse of a legal system.

I do believe I might just go insane. I've been so stressed out about my parents My face looks like a giant polka dot factory. I hate stress, my face will be just fine until I get this way, then wham.

Question 1:

If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8
kids already, three who were deaf, two who were blind,
one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis,
Would you recommend that she have an abortion?


Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.


Question 2:

It is time to elect a new world leader, and only
your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.


Candidate A -

Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with
astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain
smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.

Candidate B -

He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.

Candidate C -

He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.

Which of these candidates would be your choice?



Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.





Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt.



Candidate B is Winston Churchill.



Candidate C is Adolph Hitler.








And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question:



If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven, it's his mother.


Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think
before judging someone. Never be afraid to try something new.


Remember:

Amateurs built the ark. Professionals built the Titanic.


Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500 employees and has the following statistics:


* 29 have been accused of spousal abuse

Trying to find a good decent guy for kristy is hard. I only know like 3. If that many. I find it humerous that Im trying to hook Kristy up with Matt. Matt is so 'emo' i guess or whatever stupid term they are using this week, and Kristy is just, well kristy. Yeah anyway. Matt was saying how he was unhappy with emily being clingy and annoying and all that good stuff, and kristy was complaining about the same thing with steven, so this would be funny if it worked out.

Today its raining and schools are out. How gay are you sumner county?

I really dont have any plans for today or anything remotly interesting. I have to take mom to the dr. at 1, but after that there is nothing for me to do. Ive been trying to get a job but every freakin place I've called isnt hiring. You either have to know someone or be a blonde slut/whore who wears low cut shirts in front of the managers. Unfortunatly I qualify for none of those. I called Two different Walmarts, Lowes' in H'vill and Lebanon, O'Charlie's and Logans. If I didnt have any dignity, I'd work fast food. But everytime I work somewhere I never like to go there anymore. *Le sigh*
I want a job dangit.

Well good bye my children, I have much to do."

"event","*chuckle* Man ""music"" ""artists"" are so funny now a days, they will cause millions of dollars in problems just so they can get a little extra publicity. I didnt get to see the SuperBowl sunday because I was at church and went to dinner, but so I heard that justin timberlake riped off jannet's boob top. I looked online and found a picture, quite funny i think. If it was and ""accident"" whats up with her nice boobie jewelry, you know its like if your not expecting to be seen in your underwear you where the white ones, but if you are, you wear a nice fancy thong with lace. My point: ladies and gentlemen. This was no accident :O)

I've decided I deffinatly am not partial to wine. Dad drinks a glass every night before bed, and I take a sip, each time knowing that it tastes bitter and alchoholish, yet I still have a hope that it will taste as good as it looks. Same with beer. In the comercials it looks so refreshing and wonderful, then you try it and eek. I would have to say that is my beverage of choice, when drinking. It gets the job done faster than smirnof, or any of that... what was it pring called it? ""Girly water""... But yeah I dunno why I even got onto that subject. I dont drink anymore.

Mom's Surgery was suprisingly good, she got to leave only like 2 hours after surgery. She's up and about, but she did get kinda sick today. She'll be good tomorrow. I cant wait till I get to enjoy a nice hunk of weight being lifted from my chest also.

The most enjoyable part of my day however had to have been when I went up to the bonus room and dug out all my old toys, jurrasic park figures, barbies, littlest pet shop, legos, star wars toys plus a butt load of lisa frank stationarry. 
I had fun. Im going to start on my lego town tomorrow.
Yes, Im aware im rather childish. You're only young once."

Anyway.
Went to church last night and then Subway, and to make up for the subway Kristy and I bought Heart shaped cookies and chocolate doughnuts covered in rainbow sprinkles. I feel like a fat 'arse' none the less. I ended up getting home pretty early last night. Its amazing how boring life can get when your in trouble. Hehe. Well whatever. I did at least find something to do when I got home, I found this old website that has the top songs of every year from like the 20's to now. It helped me remember alot of song's i'd always wanted to download. Such memories. A few of the humerous goodies included:

MmmBob * Hanson
The 'cherry cola' song * Savage Garden
Never Ever * All Saints
Why dont you get a job * Offsrping
Gin and Juice * Snoop 'Dawwwg'
Cest la vie * B*Witched ... chuckle...
Baby Baby * Amy Grant
Shake your ""bon bon"" * Ricky Martin
No scrubs * TLC
Eifel 65 * Blue
Bad Touch * Blood Hound Gang
SPice up your life * Spice Girls
ROckel * In a dream


to name a few.
Yeah. Doctors Apt. today, so down to skyline to have an old man look at my boobies. Toodles all!"

<P>Well Kristy and I are screwed. We have to go to court soon, Im going to have to get mug shots and fingerprinted and everything. This should be funny. Im laughing even though Im probably going to have to pay the sherrif's dept lots of money in court fees. Heh...</P>
<P>Went to the Car show again today, It was even better the second time. I loved it. I especially like the new VW SUV, Its called a Tarogue or something. Its fully loaded. Good price too, Dad's looking into them maybe for some day in the future when he's got some extra retirement money lying around.<BR>They showed the new concept car for Ford's new Mustang. I really liked the design. They've made it look more like the old body styling with new flare. Its got a powerful engine in it too. I dont think they start production till Sept.&nbsp; I also got to see this new VW V12, (12 cylinder) they have out. Quite a nice looking car, the price goes upward to 80,000 dollars fully loaded and 73,000 for a normal one. Thats enough to buy a house. or 2 1/2 corvets. Yikes.<BR>Enjoyed the quality time with dad, it was fun getting to do something we both enjoy together since we both like cars and trucks.<BR>If anyone else wants to go the show is running through tomorrow, its at the N'vill convention center. Admission is 7 bucks, 5 bucks to park. Its well worth it.</P></TD></TR>

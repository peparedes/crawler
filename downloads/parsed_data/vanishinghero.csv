"event","if you think i'm passive then a lesson still awaits you.  I'll never run and i'll never hide, i'll stand turn and fight, just call me out and i'll be there.  Just be ready because what you get might just be a little more than you can handle.  Good luck, you'll need it, maybe next time you'll be cautious and think about who you're dealing with.


hahaha YES random anger leads to a livejournal post i actually like."

"event","Time for a short fast post.  Lately life has been ok...........I mean i can't really complain.  I'm going to college, i own a car, i have a decent life.  I've just been unhappy lately.  And so fucking lost it's ridiculous.  Like i just don't know where i'm going to be in 1 year, what school i'll be going to, what major i'll have, where i'll be living.  That kinda scares me.  I don't know i just feel lost.  And on the topic of women well............Most girls don't interest me at all.  I don't know why.  Seriously i just can't find anyone interesting enough to be attracted to.  For me personality is key and looks are secondary, although certain looks usually define certain personalities.  I can't handle ""normal"" girls because they don't challenge me, I like when girls fight playfully and argue with me.  My last date, a lunch date with a girl from my french class, was boring as fuck, mostly because we had nothing incommon, i sorta asked her out cause she was cute.......well that didn't work out cause i liked nothing about her except that she was cute, go figure.  But yeah eventually i'll find a girl who just knocks me off my feet, one who is crazy/amazing/interesting/beautiful.  I'm genuinely looking forward to that day.......if that day will ever come.  I think girls are another reason i feel lost.  Don't get me wrong i have the most amazing female friends but........but whatever yeah that's right.  I shouldn't be fucking complaining so many people have it so much harder.  I just want to be happy instead of just going through life.  Not to mention right now i'm sooooooo fucking lonely.  My two closest friends are away at their respective schools and i'm going to my school.  And they are brilliant so they get so much homework i never really get to talk to them.  My other really great friend is in highschool and he's really busy with their musical.  and my OTHER good friend he's spread thinly at his school and having many of his own problems.  Guess this entry wasn't as short as i thought it was going to be.  I wonder how many people are actually going to read this.  Sure i jumped around a lot but hey it happens, and although i talked about girls mooooooooooooost, my friends and school and life bother me way more than that, it's just girls are easier to complain about haha.  I'm a bastard."

"event","1). I'm pretty sure that i might hate you but i'm kinda ignoring that because we have fun when we hang out.

2). You're a pimp, simple as that, also you've become one of my closest friends and that's awesome, hope we keep that.
3). You....you just suck horribly at life.
4). You're a good person but, you have to work out that one flaw of yours.

5). When you're  alone, you are actually a pretty cool kid.
6). why do we do things in unison? seriously it's creepy. hahahahaha.

7). well everyone is obviosuly going to be able to tell who this one is, you're a man whore and one of my closest friends.  and sometimes we have deep talks, awesome.
8). Holy Hell you're fucking amazingly hot.  I don't really care about being friends with you i just kinda wanna fuck you...is that a bad thing? hahahaha...ooo well.
9).  You're a pretty awesome person aswell, under certain conditions/senarios i'd probably be right behind you if you know what i mean. (yes this person is female and yes that is a quote from a Steven Lynch song)
10). You rock, you're always there for me and visa versa, we talk a lot. You're pretty and hot (even though you'll never admit this) good job.
11). well, you might suck most of the time, but i don't blame you, most people suck, you do have your good moments too and i wanna make a point to see you a little more often then i do.

12). I wish i got to see you more often, I miss those days from highschool, but when we do hang out it's fun.
13). We were never really close but you know what? you're a good wildcard friend to have.

14). We don't really talk like we used to, but hey we had a lot of fun when we did, no regrets.
15). One day we are going to fucking hang out, seriously one day, cause we'd get along, until then FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING BITCH HAHAHA."

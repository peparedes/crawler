"event","Hello everyone~~ 
   well yet again its been a while since we've updated. Currently the boys have been trying to write some new material. We played a show last week at the clubhouse taven, thanks to everyone that came out. We have a few shows coming up this month, check out www.myspace.com/farewellveronarock for more details. 
            ****We are now on a website called Eekline.com (its like the new myspace) check it out, currently we are one of the feature artists!!!
   ** In June, the boys will be gearing up to go on tour w/ a band called Stalling Dawn so keep an eye out for that. 
            Jake recently got a new 15 passenger van so that traveling from show to show will be a lot easier and we'll definetly have more room. Unfortunetly, it already broke down, so looks like Ryan will be in charge once again(that's a scary thought!!! j/k) things should be fixed before you know it. 
~~~~Well that's about all the news for now. Hope everyone is doing well.
Comment back ....i'm starting to think noone is on here anymore. Let me kow who is still around!!

"event","Now that i finally have a chance i will tell you about how awesome tour was......
it started off a little choatic, the van we rented almost did get to go with us b/c none of us our 25 so we broke the law the entire tour. First night we went to tallahassee where we(excluding myself) got trashed w/ dan and rachel( how odd?)We started a ritual there that lasted through the rest of the tour: Hacky. Needless to say we all became alright at the game b/c everytime we stopped the van we had to due a full hacky in order to get back in(yes i know this sound very hippyish)We played a show in Georgia the first night w/ Jon Daws's band and the bar actuall sold Duff beer on tap!!!!!yes as in the Simpsons!!! Apparently it was pretty good. The next show was in Mississippi, 
                     THIS YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE>>>>
We played a whore house(or at least it was in the 50s) it was the shittest dirtiest coolest place. bums came out of rooms we didn't even know exsisted, there were 3 womens bathrooms and 1 men's!!! We eneded up sleping at the band Fox Chase Drive's house because we feared the STDs we might get if we slept at the venue. The next day we watched the guitar player get into a car accident, not cool but he is fine, coincidently they were listening to Farewell Verona and following along with the lyrics when a truck backed out of a driveway and hit them. We played Georgia again,whre we hung out with our old bass player John. Then we crashed at Kristen's(thanks you rock)We then played Tennessee w/ Lest Rook at this awesome venue, unfortunetly not a lot of people were there, but there were a lot of people we knew how to hacky
We also went to Nashville where we watched some country bands and saw the sights. awesome place.
. ................Back to Tally for 2 days, were we inevitably lost our hacky in Swenson's yard(give it back bitch if you find it)Hacky was followed by much drinking and a keg party,(mike jones bitch) Never before have i seen jake drink more than one night a week until tour where i think he drank at least 5 nights. he is the best drunk ever, followed by daniel (he is one of the drunks that talks you into doing stupid things like: ""drink more bitch i don't car it you've already puked, you made room for more, Now drink!"" 
All in all it was awesome, we didn't have as many people come to the shows as we had hoped but nooone knew who we were so i guess that is expected. We mad some new friends and saw a lot of cool thins(especially the mountains in Tennesse where it was cold and we had to wear jackets most of the time) However Daniel will fight me until the end and say that Alabama is the best state(cause he's an ALABAMA MAN!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>If you ever get to see Daniel's version of VH1's Behind the Music: The Chase Theory; watch it, its great. In other news thanks to everyone who came to the clubhouse this weekend. Hopefully we'll see you this friday at Skyline and this Saturday at the Clubhouse again. We got new shirts and cds so come get them(and also you can't feel the shirts, (that's for you daniel))see ya soon~~~Amanda"

(for those of you who don't know this is from those radio commercial w/ all the singing and stuff.)

Bud Light Presents: Real Men of Genius- Today we salute you, Mr. Constant Collar Putter Upper. You, bedecked in popped collar, teach us that we no longer have to live with a cold back of the neck. Sure, your Pink alligator polo may look feminine to some, but not to the 17 other frat guys wearing the same thing at the bar. Where others may see thoughtless fashion conformity, you preach a higher gospel. You preach of a world where its ok for a man to go tanning. You ask ""why cant we wear make up and use shampoo with lavender essecence"" (Where is my lipstick?) So crack open a Bud Light, Mr. Abercrombie (or is it Fitch?) because we all know, when we really need a piece of gum, you might have one... in your man purse."

"event","Farewell Verona and Bryan Johnson have parted ways. We wish Bryan luck with what ever he pursues in the future. However, the show must go on. So if anyone knows of a good bass player that is reliable, out of high school, and fits with our style of music, please post a comment and let us know. ~~Amanda"

"event","man, this last weekend was quite bittersweet for me. we got to play a sweet show in Gainesville at this place called the basement, got some killer sushi at chopstix, and for the clincher, got to see some good people like focker, swen-dawg and the jarvis (PHI DUCK HOLLA!!) But, after we get done playing the show, i go out to grab my car for load-up... THE MOTHER FUCKER GOT TOWED!!! i was so pissed that i found the tow away zone sign, punched it and almost broke my hand. its still pretty sore but its starting to feel better. when it first happened my hand looked like it would give tubby's hand a run its money. Anywho, it was 76 fucking dollars but on the brightside, i got drunk shortly there after and high for that matter at Brando's house.well, im tired of sitting around... think im gonna go to the warehouse and jam.  FYI focker, i dont think that you would stop talking to us if we dont come up this weekend . you know that we love you guys in tally but buiz is buiz. im hungry...

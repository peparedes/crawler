"event","Okay.  Okay.  I bet you've all been wondering where I've been.

I got a rush assignment on location a few towns over in some weird little tent town in a sort of miniature valley.  Weird, right?  So I was only supposed to be gone for two days, but fucking Merlin you should've seen the view there.  And by view, I don't just mean Miranda and her skin, though that does feature in a lot of my pictures.

Anyway, taking a few rolls only took another day and a half, really, but I've been locked up in my dark room for the last week putting it all together.

Mates, you have to come see this.  I've built one of those foldy room divider wotsits to display this lot of photos.  It's fucking fantastic.  And I mean, I don't mean <i>me</i>.  I mean the pictures and the way they all came together.  It's like... a portrait of a girl but it's... I can't even explain it, I'll sound like a total ponce.

Anyway, I mean it.  You should all pop by and take a look.  Hopefully you'll all like it better than Lavender did.  I met her for a quick lunch today and told her about it, and she got pissed I'd been photographing a naked woman ""for fun"", never mind that I do it for work every bloody day.  And it isn't ""for fun"".  It's for <i>art</i>.

Oh, sod it.  It doesn't matter."

"event","I've been snapping photos all over the place for this newsletter assigment.  I think I've got pretty much everyone now.  If anyone wants to check their photos, by all means, feel free.  I've put them up by my desk area.  Whatever it is.  If you don't come check, then I'm taking that as an expression of trust and using whichever ones I like best.

I took a bunch of other pictures yesterday, non-work related.  I just wandered around the muggle part of London and shot roll after roll.  Found three people willing to come pose in studio, four more who let me take a few close up shots right there on the street.  It was a good day.  I don't know what I'm going to do with them all now that I've got them, but I just sort of felt like taking pictures for fun, I guess.  It's been a long fucking time since I've done that, anyway.

...Not that taking pictures for work isn't fun.

Well.  Or it has beeen in the past, anyway.  Parkinson?  I've been told I'm to photograph you for your column.  Joyous.

So Lav and I got in this massive fight the day before yesterday.  She was being a bit of an airhead and I just got sick of it, and then she called me all sorts of names.  I felt like I was back in Hogwarts.  Anyway, I haven't talked to her since, but she sent me an owl this morning with a heart drawn onto some parchment, so I sent her one back saying sorry.  One thing led to another, and I'm going up there tonight.  I am definitely looking forward to the make up sex."

"event","Well, suppose I might as well stick to the topics of my last post and give you all an update.

My deadlines are all met, I'm ahead on my work, Ginny is no longer ""dating"" Malfoy, my hand is working just fine, and I just had some <i>very</i> satisfying afternoon sex.

Good day.

Right, anyway.  Charlie, you great prat, you've been out with Ginny <i>twice</i> already and you haven't even come to say hello?  Just for that, you're taking me out for dinner.  Tonight?  Now?  I'm <i>starving</i>.

Oi, and I learned a new word <s>from the bloke I was shagging</s>.  Draconian.  It means really harsh or severe or whatever.  Apparently it's after some old muggle politician bloke named Draco who made some laws or codes or something that were really cruel.  It came up in conversation is all, and I thought it was, you know.  Sort of relevant."

First of all.  Malfoy?  Stay the fuck away from my sister.  You're really starting to get on my nerves.

Second of all.  Ginny?  Stop.  Flirting.  With.  <i>Malfoy</i>.  It gives me a sodding headache and I don't need one right now.  If you <i>insist</i> on <i>dating</i> the ferret, at least don't talk about nursing him back to health in public, okay?  Because it makes your LOVING OLDER BROTHER WITH A STRONG RIGHT HOOK want to kill a certain blond prick and we've already talked about how I don't want to go to Azkaban.  Thank you.

Third of all.  I was developing film at the studio this morning and the lightproof door opened because I have yet to fix that sodding latch.  Anyway, I was trying to shut it quickly and I smashed all the fingers in my hand.  So not only did I wreck what I'd hoped would be a great roll of film, I also have to learn to wank with my left hand for a week until the bruises fade.  Goody.

And I've got to get that model back by Wednesday or I'll miss my deadline, so hopefully he can come up tomorrow.  I've hardly got any free time this week after six tomorrow night.

It was <i>not</i> a good day."

"event","Cor, so the woman I photographed this morning had <i>two</i> piercings in <i>each nipple</i>.  I think the whole trend of putting bits of metal through various parts of yourself is more a muggle thing than anything, but it certainly worked for her.  She had these great shoulders, too, and I took a bunch of photos that the boss is going to hate because they're a bit too artsy and not so porny, but <i>I</i> think they're fantastic anyway.  I suggest the lot of you pick up a copy of the next <i>Bedknobs</i> to get a look at her, she was fantastic.  I almost rethought my whole ""don't mix work with play"" idea, but I guess in a career like mine professionalism is important if I want any sort of, you know, credibility.

Oy, Harry, I think my assistant rates you.  Care for a set up?"

There's a lot going on but I never write anything anymore. Mayhap I should religiously record my every day's happenings for posterity but that seems very involved. Of course I will be a legendary figure and all these will only serve to help researchers make conflicting opinions of me.

I'm glad IKEA exists. They help make my house a home. My rattie Dozer died and I just can't deal with the other three now, so if anyone would like a sweet ball of furry rat loving, give me a hollashout. As it is, I'll probably just try to find them new little homes.

School is going. I'm actually trying (sorta), which is better than last semester's not-at-all.

Anyway... sleepy-ness..."

BTW, this is their cage: http://superpetusa.com/files/200px/60360.jpg

So I got a beautiful cream colored, ruby eyed little girl and her sister. Said sister barks, comme une chou. C'est tres amusant. Then Minnie shows back up from under the dresser and hops back into the cage. So now I have four. Tehe :) Dozer, Minnie, Tsarina Sasha St. Lucius the Third (Sasha), and Her Royal Eminence the Duchess Barkeley Von Digweed (Barkeley)

My brain has decided to forsake sleep. So I'm just going to kind-of wander around for a while, I guess. It's just that every time I lie down, my brain runs around with all the heartbreak and failure in the world, and everything hurts. I don't know how to explain it. I know the whole depression bit kicks in every now and again with me (<i>""Is my phone ringing?""</i> ha) but now I just... I don't know. It feels cosmic, as I'm sure it always has. 

I'm really sad that these people are married to others that they don't respect enough to remain faithful. I'm really sad that people don't understand the concept of marriage in general. Love is great and all, but that's not enough to sustain most people. Compatability, mutual respect, and compassion matter more, in my opinion. I'd rather marry my best friend than some random dude I want to sleep with, even if I wanted to sleep with him <i>really</i> bad. 

I'm really sad that there is alcoholism. And... well. I'm sad my dad has become a black-out alcoholic. I loved my dad dearly, but I don't feel like I know this reckless, pickled person. What do I say? Or to my step-dad, or to my mom? What do you say to help the people you love? What can you do while they're hurting themselves? 

I'm sad that there are people out there who take and take and take and suck the very soul out of someone. I'm even more sad that there are people that do it, who know they're doing it, and hate themselves all the more OR don't care.

So I guess now I'll just wander about the house like some sort of bipedal jellyfish."

I. Jessica:

A. I'm sorry for every time I was clingy and unyielding. Sometimes I needed you more than was necessary. I did what I could. But you were the dopest shit ever, and I just couldn't get enough of you.

B. Damn you looked amazing. I mean, truly. I think your smile has only become more radiant and warming as time has passed.

C. You make me believe those stories about people writing novels and climbing mountains years after the fact for love of someone.

D. I meant it about visiting you, when you have time. And this time I promise to be my old self-assertive, swaggering self. It's been a long journey from 16. Besides, Laura Lemay and I have already got it all planned out :)

...
Elsewhere in the world

II. My license had been suspended since March. A new license permitting to drive with passenger and between the hours of minight and five a.m. is shortly to follow, along with a motorcycle permit. I think motorcycles are good for the soul.

III. I hate this feeling of not doing anything. When was the last time I even left the state? Does anyone have a job they can take a couple weeks of vacation from for a roadtrip? Or at least a foray into another country??

IV. School... I thought college was going to be different. I thought it was not going to be high school. I thought it was a place where my brilliance would be immediately recognized and celebrated, or that I was going to at least meet other clothing-disinclined, substance-experimenting, sandal-recycling stripper/hippie/gamers. But I have yet to meet any gamers I would like to see naked, stripper-hippies, or gamers recycling. Or really even anyone terribly interesting who would understand that my job isn't just a job; it's a sisterhood.

V. And anyone who's never really worked in this line of business understands that it's really not that big of a deal, and I've never seen anyone doing coke off the back of a toilet, or really even heard anyone talk about it. And these girls are just girls, and much like the military or any other extraordinary organization, even if we fight amongst ourselves, we'll still beat any outsider's ass. But I am alienated because I'm somewhere in between the girls who get shit-faced drunk every night or come in stoned out of their gourds and the girls who come in in their house slippers and go home for a nice glass of warm milk.

VI. But I really need to just get over it, I guess. Because SEALs get over it and porn stars get over it and so on and so forth. It's just that sometimes I get this feeling of not connecting with anyone, not even Jason, who's worked in the business but is prone to giving unsolicited advice instead of taking my side and bitching with me (for the record, I often also play Devil's Advocate with his assailants).

VII. I'm looking for a person who, like Shayne, is always on my side but who, unlike Shayne, is not a psychotic lesbian. I just want a girl friend who a) appreciates or b) has experienced this type of work, can party but doesn't NEED to, and... well... yeah...

I'm starting to deflate from all the venting... sigh...

Does anyone want to go to the Vortex Thursday night? 

VIII. I wonder if anyone will even care when Jason and I get married ten years from now. He's so quick to say, ""Fuck 'em"", but I want to hear ""Congratulations!"", not ""About damn time!"" or ""Eh..."" as our first born runs around everyone's knees and our second child rests against my hip. I know, I know. We'll get to it. I'm mostly just impatient to be doing something, anything with my life.

Blargh... feel better now.

The last week was profoundly awful. I've never just fought and been pissy with my lover for days on end. I kept thinking, ""Is this what happens? You go to sleep in domestic content and wake up in civil war? Is that how it ends?"" And that just made everything worse. I didn't know what to do, except try and make the peace. In doing that I made myself more vulnerable and so when the smiles and tentative touches were rejected I was hurting that much more. I'm much more willing to be sweet and forget about the upsetness than to talk about it immediately. Better to wait until the feelings have mellowed a bit before trying to discuss what transpired.

Holy crap Mike, you have a birthday coming up. SWEET! 

Money is good. Money is <b>great.</b> I'll be glad to buy a new car at the end of the month. I'm teamed up with Sylvia right now and she's damn determined that she's going to buy a house next October. So I'm mostly just along for the drunk, naked ride.

Anyway, time to try and unwind. Jason's brother is randomly going to be staying with us for about three weeks. I hope we survive, as freakin' bonkers as we are right now.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. Now my mom knows I'm a stripper. It's pretty cool. She's basically like, ""Well, that's nice. Will you please go back to school now?"" I love moms. Almost all moms, universally.

The fourth was fun. I didn't spend it with my family so I don't have a hangover. Ha. I had a dream about Mike and Jeff. Mike was living in a cave complex with all these crazy women and Jeff, if you ever leave me at a bus station in a bikini again while my shorts are on the outbound bus, I'm going to be very upset with you. Haters! It was weird. I woke up feeling (okay time out, in the middle of typing that I remembered that I hadn't yet rinsed the foaming bubbles out of my bathtub and I ran over my foot with the chair in my haste to get to the bathtub before it melted. My foot is now bleeding and ouchy) like my sheets were dirty and my hair was full of mice and flour. You know, like they used to do back in the day.

Dreams can be brutal. Sometimes I dream about children I haven't yet birthed (or conceived, for that matter), and I wake up with an ache in my heart so big that I can't even move. Other times I dream about being in France and the grass is so green that it hurts my eyes and I spend the day after I wake in searching for cheap plane tickets to Paris. Other times I dream about my friends and I miss them and then I call them and see if they want to go see the new Superman movie on the IMAX :)

I'm trying to save up some money so Jason can quit his job and work from home doing whatever he pleases. It broke my heart to hear a coworker say that we work for five days to live for the weekend. One ought not live for the weekend. One ought to be employed in fulfilling labor that brings joy and accolades. So I'm going to bust my ass so that Jason doesn't have to work five sevenths of his life to enjoy two sevenths. I enjoy my work and want to exapnd on it, so working an extra day or three doesn't bother me. It's not like Boomers where the insanity banged on the shores of my brain and crumbled my mental fortress. The Cheetah is usually a good place to be, although it is doing the amazing shrinking workplace trick, where the more you gon into a place and work, the smaller it seems. At first I used to get lost in the labyrinth of passages. Now I breeze through them on my six inch lucite platforms with at top speed with hardly a thought.

But we deal
We deal</i>

I'm terrified to look at my grades from this first semester. What if I just didn't go to college? Like, ever? I was so excited to be going back because I thought I would be actually <i>learning</i> something. Not so. And if I'm not learning anything, then I'm sure not paying money and waking up at the crack of noon to go sit around and be bored.

Maybe it gets better. Maybe I won't have a chance to find out. 

So I've actually started hanging out and having social encounters. It's kind-of hard, since the people I hang out with are all raging potheads and I've not been able to smoke in like a year without getting sick. Especially that last time... So Shane just tells people that Nikki can't handle her weed. And that's cool. And everyone has eight different names 'cause they're all party kids and they have photo albums full of them cuddling at raves with fuckin candy sleeves and binkies hanging out of their mouths. And did I forget to mention they're all lesbians? But it's cool to chill at the Waffle House and drink chocolate milk and just see who happens to stop in. It makes me happy in the way that clams are. 

Today is Brett's birthday. Is it appropriate to be festive? I think so. After all, we are celebrating his birth and not his demise. And the only thing I regret is not having known him better. But I'm trying to come around more. Slowly but surely I'm getting out of the house more. I mean, damn, I saw Ron twice in one month. Holy shit! I miss you guys."

That's because I had mine pierced about eight hours ago. My tongue, I mean. Not my popsicle. Ow! Well, okay, it's not really THAT bad. The best part was the piercist (Devon, down at Stone Age Tattoo, who I like much more than Mike, the owner of the place) telling me, ""Alright, don't close your mouth 'cause you've got a big scary needle sticking through your tongue."" Thanks, I couldn't tell. Jason was cracking me with all his questions and worrying over me, as if I've never had a tattoo or piercing done and I have no idea what's going on. Come to think of it, though, I did forget to ask what guage the piercing is. Does anyone know standard tongue piercing size? I'm think it's like a 14. I any case, it's not like I'll be buying a new barbell for it anytime soon.

Work is wonderness. The girls are so much less evil, and less bitchy. We know that for every night we walk broke, there's two more nights we'll leave qith $800+. Life as as stripper is good. We're the most coddled, catered to, spoiled individuals on the planet. But who can say what we're doing is bad? All programs are supported by viewers like you. Ha. 

What I really mean is that this job has given me the confidence to wear open-toed shoes. It makes me unembarrassed to style my hair. In other words, it has made me okay with the fact that I am, well, a... girl. And a girly girl at that. I love pink and black. And pink and white. And pink and orange. And... well. Yeah. Between Jason, stripping, and my own natural proclivity for bombast, I feel like a freakin' superhero.

This was the club that rose to the occassion after the Gold Club got shut down. While the Pink Pony is a good time to be had by all, the absolute best money and the absolute most beautiful women work at the Cheetah. I walked in, and these girls looked like fucking porn stars cruising around. It's hard to believe that... I look like a porn star. I kind-of understand what celebrities mean when they say they never think of themselves that way (wow, that sounded really egotistical). I guess I just don't view myself as a sex object, not really.

Tonight was awful money. Last night was ok because, remember kids, it only takes ONE Captain Save-A-Ho. This particular one came in again tonight and I gave up a VIP to Skye because, well, I honestly don't care at this point. Oh, Skye. Why don't you trust me enough to tell me this one thing? It's not like I would have condemmed her, EVER. And like Gabby-face is going to keep that from me. Oh well. What can I do? She'll tell me when she wants me to know.

School recomences on Monday. I made a 75 on my math midterm! Fuck yeah! And a 90 on my project to boot.

I FUCKING HATE THIS CLASS. murder murder murder makes me happy happy happy. I don't need to learn how to take notes. I already know how to take tests. I know how to get involved in school organizations and I will do it when I have the time and am not switiching jobs or coming back to school after a year and a half off or any other number of things.

No, really. Mad bank. I mean, <b>mad</b> bank. Like, double what I usually make in a weekend. Double what I usually make in one weekend <i>per night.</i> It was absurd. So now I have to go elsewhere, though I'll probably wait a few weeks, until after my birthday. Making this much money is intoxicating. I can see why gamblers have such a problem.

I'm furious with management for being exceptionally rude to the people from the supercross team that came in. They spent about $700 on me, Jezebel, and Katie alone. There was no need for management to be terrible to them. And now I understand why Boomers will never prosper, even though they could. The potential is there. We have such beautiful and engaging girls, and we're far enough from other clubs that we could monopolize the area. *sigh* But they want us to be extra-sweet to the assholes that dangle a dollar and look dissappointed at our backflips and cartwheels and rude to the people that just randomly hand us hundreds of dollars for no apparent reason.

I have abunch of running around to do but I can't find my car keys so I thought I'd update here and not think about them and perhaps I would remember where they were.

We had to make these little HO-listic (teach's pronounciation, not mine) wellness charts. But everyone doesn't necessarily fit into the HOlistic wellness niches. Like, according to this little dohickey, I am so socially unwell that it's just absurd. But I don't have time to like, go out. I see people all night at work. I have all kinds of friends, if by friends you mean people that give me money to hang out with them and get naked.

This really random thugged-out guy took me to VIP. I didn't really know what to do. But I've definitely learned my trade because I made conversation and it was a good time. Turns out he was a Marine trying to unwind on leave. Could've fooled me, with his extra baggy pants, gigantic Sean John shirt, and mad blingin' chain. Cool enough.

Valentine's Day was sweet. And I got a PS2 to replace the one Rick broke (grrr). So that's what I've been doing lately.

School is. My sociology prof likes to grade tests on what he meant to write, and not what's actually written. I'm trying to find some way to ace the class, but I'm drawing blanks here. Logic fails me. It appears to be shit luck. I'm dive-bombing math modeling. I'm not sure what I'm going to do about this, considering I still need to take another math course after this bitch. God help my soul.

Being with Jason is rad. I don't quite know what to do about it. I remember being in love in the past and it was poetry. I just like to look at him. I like to recall the curve and fullness of his lips, the shape of his eyebrows. Guess I'm a weird one. I guess the thing is that I'm not focused on me in this one. It's not about how *I* feel; it's not about trying to impress him with odes and poetry. With Jason I'm just me. Here I am. This is just me. I want him to know that I love him so that he can be secure in it and wrap it around and be fearless in the day. But I don't have to tell him. I just do it. I just love him. And after that I love him. And then we get into a fight because he ate the rest of my almonds. And during that I love him. And when we're done, I love him. It's kind-of cool, actually. And strange to believe that after a year and a half, there are still walls to come down. And not just small, subtle ones. Some huge ones that we don't even talk about that much, if ever, but we know they're there <i>(their they're there hahaha!!!)</i>.

Boo. I don't want to make breakfast but I know if I stay up he's going to ask me to and I won't tell him no. Damn! There goes his alarm... defeated..."

So I'm supposed to start writing in my journal every other day. It will help me relax and get in touch with myself. Or whatever. Math 1101 is kicking my behind. I made one of two A's on my first Psych test, and an 86 on my first sociology test. KSU 1101 (the freshman seminar let's-hug-kumbaya class) is... well. Wretched. I hate that there are classes in college where almost half the points for a semester come from... attendance. I'm not in college to <i>attend</i>. If I wanted to attend, I'd go back to high school. Yack.

Am preparing for whatever new job I'm getting. I must go tomorrow and get my nails done (I *have* to get my nails done for my new job; life is grand). Then I need to get my eyebrows waxed, in archs this time and not curves. I bitched a total dive meltdown Barbie bitch fit last time. My eyebrows looked wrong. I need archy eyebrows, like a pornstar's, not curved soccer-mom eyebrows. Grrr!

I know other clubs do extras. But I have such utter disdain for anyone who propositiions me that I can't imagine ever being tempted to compete with the girls that do. Jason said, ""Some people might offer you outrageous amounts of money, like a thousand dollars."" I said, ""A thousand dollars? If you're going to call me a ho, at least don't call me a cheap ho!"" I've gotten to the point where it doesn't upset me when people request weird/gross/sexual things from me. It only upsets me if they're cheap about it. I could give so many exampls but I'll just go with the most recent one. A guy was asking me about a VIP (a 15-minute one; wanker) and then he was all grumpy when I told him it was no touching. The thing is, I only keep $50 for a 15-minute VIP (for those of you who think that sounds like a lot, it is, but it isn't. A 30-minute VIP will net you $100-$150 and an hour will net you anywhere from $200-$300). Touch you, for $50? Dumb-ass, I don't <b>want</b> to touch you. If I did, you wouldn't have to pay me. Mother fucker. So I just told him I had enough stress already and walked away and took someone else's money. Hehe! 

I HEART REGULARS!!! And that's all I'm going to say. Those people that randomly walk in and always tip you something like $30 for a stage set, and just walk up to the stage and leave it there. I love it! Love love love!! Those are the poeple that make the job worthwhile. And I heart Gabby-ness. She's my favorite ever!! They fired Chris, too, which is good, because he was mad-creepy. 

I want to talk to my mom, but every time I talk to her, all she wants to do is scold me because I never call her anymore. And that makes me really not want to call her.

PS I beat Psychonauts. Haha! Victory is MINE!"

I am so super-stoked to be going to Germany & France this September. I want to run around Paris like a crazy person. There's eight hundred million things to do! Here's the abbreviated list:

- Musee Carnavalet (the museum of the history of Paris; seems a good starter point)
- The Louvre (of course)
- Musee D'Orsay
- L'Arc de Triomphe
- Eiffel Tower (ugh, but I have to if I'm going to be in Paris)
- Montmartre (of course!)
- Moulin Rouge (double of course!!)
- Versailles
- Mont St. Michel
- Champs D'Elysees
- Le Centre Pompidou
- Notre Dame
- The Bastille
- Le Jardin du Luxembourg
- Puces de St. Ouen

Hahaha!! It's cheaper and quicker to go to Frankfurt by plane first, spend a few days there, and then take a train (a train!!) to Paris.

BTW, I made a 91 on my first college math quiz. SnAAAAAkes!

I heart Star/Gabby. I wish I could've met her years ago, dude. Although maybe we wouldn't have been friends then. But I think we would have. She's such a Leo, and I'm such an Aries, and we speak the same language. That random shit that only strippers understand. That's why I try to explain it sometimes but I can't. This is a whole different lifestyle. This is a lifestyle where you'll randomly see girls running around in a bra with a tampon string hanging out, trying to find some nail glue, and asking if they can borrow someone's wig. We're in such close quarters, doing such completely naked things, under such psychological pressure. The stripper bubble protects you, but it exhausts you as well. That's why we ho's don't usually work five and six days a week. You have to suppress your self, and get into Zone. I still express myself (what, hide this personality? Yeah right!), but... it's different. Nikki is not Danyell and Danyell is not Nikki, but they're still just aspects of the same person, and not even really dissimilar aspects. 

I dunno. This job changes you, dude. As young as I am, too. It really makes you come to terms with who you are and what you're expecting from life nd the people in it.

Things with Jason are good. We had a hearty, abusive, hilarious time this evening, just hanging out and planning our trip. It's weird how he's so self-posessed most of the time and so laid-back about sex whereas I'm usually just kind-of wandering through my days at a leisurely pace and completely psychotic when it comes to intimacy. The past couple of weeks have been super-stressful, and it sometimes feels like I end up crying every time I try to play with him because I do something stupid and he gets onto me. And then I feel even worse for crying, like he's thinking, <i>""Oh, there she goes again...""</i> It's really awful, because I usually know when I'm acting like a total nutjob, but it feels like there's nothing I can do about it. And I know he loves me, but it's hard to feel that way sometimes, when <i>I</i> feel undeserving. I was flipping through an awesome book at Barnes & Noble, and it had this little checklist of things ""wrong"" with the other person, and my favorite was:

*Having to ask how I feel instead of just knowing*

YES! That's <b>AWESOME!!!</b>

Jason's credit is going up, mine is going down. Maybe we'll meet somewhere in the middle. Ha! I'm trying to thing of my next car, but I just can't decide what. Not that I'll be able to afford one any time soon. Between working at Boomer's, going to school, our Europe trip, paying off my eight grand in debt, and the wedding, well. It's gonna be a minute :)"

School is still super-exciting. My attendance has been, um, well, you know. Collegiate. I still want to go. I'm just doing that thing I did in high school where I skipped the class in favor of catching up on reading the text, completing assignments, etc. Doing homework is definitely reminding me of the need for my own room/office space.

I love Jason hard. He rocks my socks straight off, homes. It's that smile, and his man-giggles, and his bad-assness with a sword. Mad hot. He makes me want to do something incredible in the name of love :)

Life is good. Challenging, but I relish the challenge. I function best with my balls to that wall. 

Yo Jeff-san, holla! Come and get this book so I can stop wondering what its fate will be. Plus I need more room on my bookshelves. It's a wonderful thing to have a room partially filled with books because there isn't enough room on your bookshelves. Haha!"

Bonnie, the new dog, is awesome. She loves the hell out of Jason and couldn't care less about me. It's funny because Scout and Skylar never let me out of their sight and are afraid of Jason most times, and Bonnie flips out when Jason gets home and ignores me all day. She's so BIG, though! She doesn't seem that big until she sticks her nose on the kitchen counter while you're cooking. And there's so many of them to pet now. You can't pet just one. All three come mob you. There is no escape.

The two best ways to make money at a strip club (other than becoming Renee) is (a) to have a buddy system and hit 'em up in pairs, or (b) compete with your closest friend there. Since Star and I can't necessarily guarantee that someone who likes one of us will like the other, we compete. And we compete all the way to the bank. Hahaha! I brought home $200 the other night, well, ""without even trying"" is not the right word. I tried hard as fuck. I worked my ass off all night, but I didn't sweat the money until both of us had a couple of minutes to sit and count our cash. And, since she stayed about $20 ahead of me all night, I busted my ass. I didn't get naked ONCE on stage the whole night (meaning I made less than $10 every time I went on stage), but I did get 13 table dances, about ten of which tipped me at least $10 on top of the $10 base price. However, Star had a $50 stage set, so... It all adds up, you see. All in all a fun night, and I didn't have to stress the fuck out. The depressing thing is that I made $250 that night but left with right at $50 on Wednesday and like, $27 on Sunday. So I really only made about $250 for the week total after tip-out. And $200 of that was just Friday night. Oh well, that's pretty decent for three days' work. I'm not allowed (by Jason) to work more than four nights a week, though, because I get EVIL after that.

I finally have garters. Whoo-hoo! No more borrowing. That is, until all mine are stolen.

I already have Ron's Christmas present. What does everyone else want? Too bad, I'm getting you something else. Hey, maybe I'll make a grand a week at the Pink Pony for the next three weeks and buy everyone a new Xbox 360. That'll happen. Sure it will."

It's weird that Ron is in love. It's weird how bad I want a kid, how bad I've wanted one for years but it seems like this whole career thing is setting off a biological panic. Like, <i>Quick! Reproduce before it's too late!!</i> And I'm afraid now, because if I go forward with this and later in life I can't conceive, what am I going to do? What adoption agency is going to give a child to a touring stripper? How am I supposed to counsel gifted kids when parents can't trust my morals? Because I would hate to get six months into therapy and them tell their parents they found out I was a porn star. Or some dad brings his kid in and remembers me from the hard-core bondage website. What then? You can do <i>any</i>thing you want in life, you just can't do <i>every</i>thing you want in life.

The new doggie arrives tomorrow. And my court date is Thursday. Yay! My first time in court. Whee! Le sigh. Oh well. Jason's lending me the money to get a Fulton county permit on Friday. I don't know what I'll do without my girls (aside from pay my bills)...

Jason really upset me the other night. I didn't want his realism when we're discussing my dreams. I don't want practicality. I want to do my own thing or go down swinging. I don't want to be told that I can't. I want to pull a Gypsy Rose Lee, a Betty Page, a Madonna. And so when he told me I would probably never make it into Playboy, I was extremely upset. I still am, kinda. Like, Don't tell me that. I'm going to have enough people telling me that out there. Don't kiss me with the same mouth that tells me I can't achieve my dreams.

At the top of my list of things I love about Jason is the way he looks at me every time I enter a room. It's such a good feeling when we see each other again for the first time all day. I love how he always cuddle me <i>just so</i>, and how I'll wriggle and squirm like a puppy trying to settle in for the night. I hate when he gives me advice for at work, but I love the intent behind it. It's hard to not get frustrated at the actions, and even harder when you're frustrated at the actions at not the intent. Like a two-year-old destroying the kitchen trying to make a cake :) I love the way he smells. I love the way he sleeps. I love his little kicks and twitches at night when he's sleeping; it always makes me think he's dreaming of being a ninja. I love the way he always reaches out for me in his sleep (yeah, I know, at lot of these are sleep-centered. Opposite shifts, go figure.). 

And it's not like before, but I know that it never will be that way with anyone, and that's probably a good thing. Ron was the image of God to a  seventeen-year-old girl (to steal his phrasing) and if I ever do trust someone that much ever again, it will be because enough time has passed and we've had enough experience together. And I trusted Ron because he knew me, intuitively somehow, and I could depend on him to make the decision about me that I would make were I an objective observer in the situation. We never argued; we never needed to. And it was good, and it was special because it came so naturally. Jason and I argue (or ""scrap"" as I have taken to calling it; apparently ""argue"" is too strong of a word); we need to. You just can't live with someone and not scrap. It's unhealthy. It's good, and it's special because we both have to work our asses off.

Being exhausted only adds to it, but when you're stressed the fuck out and you can only sleep for short bursts when you reach maximum overload, well. That's some shit.

I am TOTALLY looking forward to my trip to Florida. It's nice to have your homeland be paradise. Not only are you going to paradise, but you always feel that sense of homecoming. The ocean will always call to me, even if it's just to be near it. I don't like fishies nibbling on my toes. But it's that smell, and that perpetual breeze, and the Spanish moss on the trees, and the sand on the side of the roads. It's remembering my childhood with world-famous theme parks in my city and a short drive away. We only did the theme park thing every now and again. Usually it was museums and zoos. My dad rocks so hard. It's kind-of weird to hear him go on and on about Cole the way he does (Cole is one of his new step-sons). I love Cole to death. I love all my dad's new kids to death. A fourteen-year-old girl (whom I haven't met yet) named Katie, a twelve-year-old boy (can't remember his name at the moment; I've only met them once), a 10-year-old girl named Abby, and 2-year-old Cole. Cole is wretched though, because he is so darling and well-behaved that I just want to have kids all the more. Damn it all. It will be good to see them this weekend. 

Maybe Jessica will understand, although she did have a younger brother so maybe not. I have always been the center of my dad's universe. I feel kind-of like I'm being replaced. It doesn't matter if it's logical or not (sorry, Jason and I already got into it about this one). And it's stupid to be jealous of a two-year-old, I know, but... Oh well. It's hard sometimes to feel like Daddy's little girl when you're a stripper.

Speaking of which, I had a record-breaking THREE other tables watching me dance for this one table. WOW. It was infuriating. Except that I'm done being mad. I was just kind-of sad and frustrated. The one table suddenly didn't speak English, these other two guys just walked away right after I finished, and this other guy sitting at a small table (which you can't dance on) was all like, ""Oh, no thank you, I just had a dance."" And I'm all like, ""Hey, it doesn't count unless it's on your freakin' table, dumb-ass! It's not YOUR dance when I'm on someone else's table."" As much as I hate getting trapped in VIP by myself, I have a feeling I'm going to be selling a lot more. People piss me off, and Boomers has the cheapest of all the cheap hoes, damn it all, I just can't scrape together the $350 I need between traffic tickets and overdraft fees and needing to go to the doctor and my tags being expired and my credit card bills. I'm a STRIPPER. $350 should be chump change, something I can easily make in a night. I don't want a good night to be one where I make $150 dollars, and an amazing night one when I make $200 (it's only happened twice. And that's some bullshit.) A good night at the Pink Pony or the Cheetah will bring you a fucking GRAND. $1,000. I don't make that in a <b>month</b>. And, granted, some girls can pull in about a grand a week here at the ol' Boomers. But there's no telling why. Boomers ia a space-time void of reality where people that shouldn't make money do and people that should make money don't. Tell me why you will give Skye a dance and not me. Riddle me this. We look similar enough that everyone asks if we're sisters, and we tell them that we are :) Even Jason was diggin her. I dunno. *I* love her, so I'm not a good judge. I do know she loves to fuck with people, and I just want to have a good time. And I'm not trying to become the girls that I watch so closely. I'm just trying to learn from them.

Alyssa told me to smile harder when I'm asking for dances. Works beautifully. But, for the most part, if I don't sit and talk to someone and sell my personality, I won't get that dance. Like, dammit, I though you hoes came here to escape your nagging wife and girlfriend. Why do you want to chit chat? I just want to get naked and take your money. Ha. 

Tell me why a damn big-tittied stripper with long burgundy hair and beautiful legs has to sell her personality? But I always sell that dance if I sit with them, and I almost never sell that dance if I don't.

Haha, that last one is my favorite. Remind me to say that next time I'm at work. And I'm going to blow up at the next person who snakes one of my dances. I think I'm suddenly going to be a single mother trying to put herself through school without having to go on welfare and have a little self-respect, UNLIKE YOU PEOPLE!!!

<P>I've been having trouble with Star lately. I was feeling sad and underappreciated. Then Krissy tells me that Star was talking about how she missed riding home with me. And I realized... I'll do anything, give up anything, and go to any lengths for someone I care about and all they need to do is love me in return. Jesus said the most important thing in life is to love one another. If that's true, then I know my licentious, lewd, lascivious, lustful, leggy&nbsp;ass is going to Heaven. I love six ways til Sunday. And that makes me feel like a good person. This quality in me sometimes makes it hard for people to live up to the standards or what I think a friend should be. But fuck it. I'd rather be hurt, offended, abandoned, and/or betrayed than feel like I wasn't there when someone needed me.</P>
<P>Speaking of being there for people, my house is getting pretty damn full. I've already told Jason that I want a one bedroom house after this. Spare bedrooms are a recipe for disaster. Either that or put a kid into one, and I don't think that's going to be happening for a couple of years at least.</P>
<P>I'm glad Fenyx wasn't being a hater at work. Everyone that I talk to at work always raises hell when I say I want kids. It's either ""No you don't!"" or ""Wait as long as you can!"" or some other nonsense. Fenyx just simply said, ""I don't know what I would do without my girls."" It was good to hear that from someone I look up to as well. Yes, raising a child is hard. But if it was that bad, no one would have more than one, ever. I don't know. It's just that same vein to me, that whole don't-follow-your-dreams business. Like yeah, I probably won't get to go one and become a famous feature dancer and model and star in porn. But I'll certainly never make it if I don't try. </P>
<P>Nobody ever made anything of themselves when they weren't trying or when they were just trying to fit in with the crowd. My new hero is Betty Page. She did her thing even though everyone told her she couldn't and now she's an icon. Same with Madonna.

The night started out fine with an older crowd and I did pretty consistent $20 stage shows, then I got to hang out with some pretty cool guys and got a few table dances. A mediocre night, at best, but I did a shit-ton better than I would've two weeks ago.

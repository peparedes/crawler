"event","<font size=1><center>i have such a nostalgic feeling right now. i'm thinking of this past february. i get a weird feeling when i think about it. a good feeling. it was such an amazing time in my life. and i want to go back to that month soooo badly. it seriously hurts to know that i can't return to it. :[

i actually used to be kinda cute. i weighed or at least looked about fifteen pounds less. i didn't wear my ugly glasses every day. i wore cute clothes. my skin was pretty much flawless.
i need to work on myself. i'm on a diet and i'm going to actually try to look nice. and hopefully everything will just get better from there. and maybe i'll get that feeling of february again!

ugh. forget life sometimes.

ps, i miss my boyfriend.

"event","Yesterday at work...did I do anything?  Yes.  I did some things.  Let me tell you all about them, vaguely.

I ran a gel.  I turned out how I expected it would.
I played with the new camera, because I was being a slacker and excited about the new camera.
I attended three professional development workshops, some of which were better than the others.
I checked my onions.

Today I need to:
Fertilize the onions.
Check the radishes and lettuce.
Collect samples from the onions and add mineral oil to their necks.
Write up responses to the sessions I attended yesterday (for my teaching certificate that is not a real teaching certificate).
Go the the container gardening presentation.
Go see Anne.
Also take some photos of thrips."

"event","I have been considering for some time starting a new blog.  I like the format of the one Peter and I have together much better than the format here and there is something about live journal that leaves me feeling uncomfortable.  I think it is the friends thing and the padlocked posts.  My feeling is that the internet was set up to be an open exchange of information (ok, it was something else before that and is a changing thing) and that if someone is going to take the time to write in this public forum, it should be left open to the public.  That is, I fail to see the point of writing something publicly then hiding it.  To that end, things I need to write but don't want anyone to see get written on paper.  This electronic writing in a public forum are the bits of me I am willing to present.

I also wrestle with the issue that here I have written about some specific people, in a possibly unflattering way.  I don't want those people figuring that out.  (Yes, I know that is not in agreement with what I said above.)  I want to let more of myself out, but I don't think this is the place I want to do it.  

Anyhow, I will admit I like starting things, and maybe starting a new blog feeds my need to start new projects.  I do think the other one is easier to work with, and like I said earlier, I prefer the format.  It's...got cleaner lines, or something.  The pictures stand out better.  I don't have any special plans for it, just an interest in doing it."

"event","The other day I connected all the little flags that pooped up in the cemetery with Memorial day.  Today I connected the flags, Memorial day and a trip to France I took with my girl scout troop about 18 years ago.  We were there with boy scouts and also French girl and boy scouts.  I am fuzzy on the details (and was then, too) but it seems the whole point of the trip was to plant French and American flags on every single grave at this cemetery.  I don't know what cemetery it was.  It was one of those war cemeteries with row after row of perfectly aligned white headstones that were either crosses of stars of david.  

The actual work wasn't bad- just poking holes in the ground, then sticking the little flags in.  I think we slept in tents and didn't have much free time.  All the girl and boy scouts flirted with each other.  I think one of my friends bought a baguette.  The last day we had to dress up in our uniforms and it was cold and grey, not unlike today.

That's the only time I've ever been to France- to stick flags in graves."

"event","I designed some primers this morning, which took longer than I expected, on account of there not being much sequence to choose from with Frankliniella schultzei.  I've made primers for three thrips species that recognize sequence in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene.  The problem I was having with the schultzei primers was that the COI sequence is also very similar to the COI sequence from other species.  That's not really a problem if the other species is not a thrips, because in theory, I'm going to know what sort of insect I'm grinding up and not likely to accidentally have an aquatic organism in there.  The trouble was that the primers also want to recognize Thrips palmi.  I need to find out how likely it is that palmi is going to be in the area, but I don't really feel like having that conversation today.  Anyway.  The primer pair I settled on matches perfectly to schultzei but has 4 mismatches to palmi, so hopefully that's good enough.  I guess I'll find out once they get here and I try them.

Oh!  That reminds me that I was using the primer BLAST, which was really cool.  You enter your forward and reverse primers and the program will search for sequences the primers match with and then let you know from what organism (and what gene) your pcr product will be.  I thought it was useful for checking out the specificity of my primers.  So, I played with that for a while, and checked some primers that I have been using for a while, and they seem ok and I feel better about all those pcrs.

I also cleaned out some tubes of dirt.  The dirt was really, really wet, so I think I drowned my onions.  I'll have to water them less next time.  I also set up some seeds to sprout and plan to put them in dirt Friday.  I got some pots of dirt set up in the greenhouse- some awaiting onions and others for more lettuce and radishes.  

Tomorrow:  Plant more radishes and lettuce.  Stain the onion roots from last week.  Autoclave the tubes I washed today and put dirt in them when they are dry.  Update lab notebook.  Feed the bugs with Peter.  There's probably some reading I need to be doing as well."

Anyway.  Now I'm a grad student.  I like the work I've been doing so far.  It's starting to look like my project will be looking into hosts and transmission of Iris Yellow Spot Virus in onions.  Yeah, we already know that thrips (Thrips tababci) are the insect vector of the virus, but we don't know yet how exactly weeds are playing a part in all this.  I'll get to play with weeds and bugs and onions and virus.

The virus is pretty cool.  It's got three segments of RNA, two of which are ambisense, meaning that the RNA codes for proteins in both the 5' to 3' direction and the 3' to 5' direction.  

I'm having fun finding the virus in new plants and making pcrs work.  I need to arrange for a growth chamber and look into pcrs on the insects and how exactly do onions grow.  Knowing how the onions grow may shed some light on how the virus moves through the onion.

It's also fun to catch toads in onion fields."

I do believe that our bodies have lots to tell us if we learn how to listen to them.  Still, I continue to not listen as well as I should or would like to.

Sometimes I feel guilty that I have good health while people I love and care about very much are struggling with their own health problems.  I wonder why I should be so lucky.  Maybe I'm healthy so that I can care for the one(s) I love.  Maybe I just got lucky in the genetics department.  I don't know.  I do know that I want very much to do things that help my loved one(s) heal.

I suppose I do have the hypoglycemia thing going on.  I noticed today when it hit.  I was feeling ok most of the day, then I noticed that I was suddenly sleepy, depressed and lethargic- I felt like crap.  I had eaten lunch around noon, then was feeling like this around 3.  I bought some cashews and ate them and felt a little better for a little while.  Was feeling crappy again by the time I got home.  I really need to eat more than I have been.

I suppose I shouldn't worry so much about my being healthy vs other people being not as healthy and just do what things I can to help take care and heal, both myself and others."

"event","About 1 cup of masa harina.
About 1/2 stick of butter.
Salt, cumin and cayenne- whatever looks right that day.
A dab of veg stock
water

Melt the butter and stir in the masa harina in small increments.  Add water as needed to keep the dough fairly moist- somewhere between cookie dough moist and cake batter moist.  Add the seasonings whenever, so long as they get stirred in well.  Butter a pie pan, add the dough and bake at 350 until a knife comes out clean.  (About 25 minutes.)

Top with whatever sounds good.  In this case onions, yellow squash, beans and green chilies.  

NOTES:
The dough is decent but could use a little more something.  Butter?  Spices?  Maybe a chopped chipotle?"

"event","I have scheduled a moving dude.
I have booked a plane ticket.

I should be able to relax a bit now, but I might be too excited.
Plus, you know, I have to fly on two planes and that's stressful.

I hear fireworks.

I'm hungry.

Cake?  Ice cream?  Cake&icecream?

I'd better make room for the next stack of boxes.

Anybody need a P-Chem textbook?  With study guide???"

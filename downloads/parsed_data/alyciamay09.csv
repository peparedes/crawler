I came home from Kristins at like 3ish and then just came home to hang out.This weekend sucks cause a lot of people went out of town for the holiday so theres like nothing at all for me to do.And then I hate when I go over Kristins house and shes gonna hang out with Sean the next day cause then that day all she does is talk to him on the phone and get ready to go...oh well. So last night Ryan was gonna go over Kristins to hang out but Kristin freeeeaked so he didnt which kinda sucked cause it would have been a fun time like over the summer....maaaany memories.Oh well.....4 weeks until Christmas!!! welp check ya later</FONT></P>

And then I went to Kristins which really was a freakin blast cause we hung out for a while and then had a freakin sweet snowball fight.Then on Thanksgiving I came home from kristins at like 12ish and helped my mom cook dinner =) I freakin love a Thanksgiving dinner.So then after dinner I got stuck cleaning the kitchen and then played some cards with my mom and sister. Then today I woke up at like 9.30ish to go shopping and of course didnt actually start til like 12 cause we had to wait for my aunt to babysit.So me and my sister shopped and shopped and shopped which was fun.

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff6666>So today was preeetttty long. I got woke up at 11:30 by my niece who was screaming. When i went to see&nbsp;what was the matter she was just mad that my sister put her in her chair thing&nbsp;so my sister could feed her. That was not a very good start for a day.Lol. So then me n my&nbsp;sister decided that we should go swimming, but first we&nbsp;had to go tanning. We have to go&nbsp;because we're in my cousin's wedding and she don't want us to have tan lines from out bathing suits. So me n my sister take turns tanning because we had the baby. And of course my sister decided that she had to go first and just kinda leave me in the car with the baby. After like two minutes the baby started <STRONG><U>screaming</U></STRONG> which definately sucked. And she then decided to stop and go to sleep like three minutes before my sister came out. So my sister got to come out and sit in the car with the baby sleeping which was probably nice for her. After tanning we went to my nana's house, which is my dad's mom. I ended up vacuming the pool which took forever it felt like. Like an hour and a half after swimming me and my sister decided that we wanted to go home. A little while after we got home my mom and dad got home and told me that they were going to my aunt and uncle's so i was like what the heck i'll go. And my aunt and uncle are putting an addition on their house so i was suppose to be roofing. But the guys wouldn't let me so i got to take a sledge hammer and hit the posts from where their deck they torn down like a month ago had been. And of course my uncle cemented the posts in because he had built a part off the deck for their hot tub so the posts had to be sturdy. So i pounded the posts for hours. On one end of it was the sledge hammer and on the other end was an axe so of course after a couple hours of hitting the posts i figured that i would't hit myself with the axe, but i was wrong. I was just liftingt the axe to move it and i cut my leg open, yesssss, just what i needed. Also from hitting the posts i got a big blister on my thumb which also hurts. I guess i shouldn't volunteer doing that anymore. So then i got to come home after eating a very late dinner there and i got in the shower. After the shower i packed a little because i'm going up north tomorrow with kristin.Yessssss. Then i got online cause she told me to and here i am now. What a very long day.</FONT></P>

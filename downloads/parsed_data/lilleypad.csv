I have a pair of Vera Wang heels that I absolutely love. They make my 5'1"" look a little closer to 5'6"" and it's all leg! The only downside is I can't wear them for too long. I don't have the tough skin in the right places for those shoes not to hurt in the worst way. I suppose that means that I won't be conquering the world in those puppies but they'll stay in my closet no matter what.

So, for some reason, I have hit a wall. It's a wall of fear I think! I want, so badly, to go back to school. I keep telling myself that if I want this bad enough then I will do the work and succeed. The only problem is that I know me. No matter how bad I want something I will find a way to slack, cut corners, and screw things up. I always have and I always will.

My other worry is the deal with student loans! I know so many people who have finished school only to be hunted down by their banks. I guess it's all the unknown that's been keeping me from accomplishing anything! I've never been good with unknowns. 

I keep telling myself I need to just stop worrying and jump in, both feet, but I just can't push myself to do it. I think I just need to sack up and deal. Now it's just a matter of pushing myself to do this."

"event","I was reminded of this old journal today, I decided I should check it out, see if I can remember the days when I wrote in this for hours! After reading a bit of it, I don't so much remember writing in it but I do recall the hours I would spend making icons to represent my moods and whatnot.

Life has gotten to be too busy it seems, I'm seeing that LJ has a Mobile Posting features ... I'll have to see what I can do with it.

Until then, I'm just updating so that people know I'm alive. Surprise!"

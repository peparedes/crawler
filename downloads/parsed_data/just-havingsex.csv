tomorrow is what's gonna be the wierdest wake of my life.
and thankyou to everyone who commented on my last entry.
all i want to do is watch uptown girls but i can't cos everyone else in the world is a dumb idiot.
AND i realized that we can hate them for being mean to our friends but we can't hate them for being mean to us! which explains everything mysterious in the world. probably."

and your room could not be prettier as we danced there alone.
this t.v.'s old. the colors fucked, do you see the difference in the shades?
but the green still glows to green, my love and i believe we are the same.
and we'll stay like this all gold and green. 
Light collects and projects your heart on a  movie screen
and if you close your eyes we will always be the way we were that night you crawled inside of me
and slept in my blood the way you sleep now.
the quietest hush has consumed this house
and when the doctors have gone and you sweat through the bed
with the pictures and pills piled around your head,
just rest now."

at OLIVE'S. 
yeah!
one time this guy who was really italian and equally as drunk said this:
""yo... wanna make out?""
and it was funny.
then another time at the mall, this eighth grader in a trench coat, says this:
""hey""
and then i say, Monica i think someones talking to me
then he says hey
and i say uhh
then he says  ""wanna hang out?""

i feel on top of the world. only not. cos i dont like guys who are nice to me, minus one. 
but sometimes when i PSYCHO-analyze situations i think that i like to be treated badly."

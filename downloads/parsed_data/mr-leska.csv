"event","craziet weekend ever. skate and destroy. I was with pisty and the rest of the skate crew in front of town hall. A cop drove up and told pisty to move along. of course he didn't. the cop drove around the block like I told pisty he would. and then yelled, ""why do you have to be such an asshole!"" then made us move along. Podballs yelled shit at the cop, and we continued for a block. T'was crazy. Pisty got put in the back of a cop car and driven home, then i left for home. and that leaves us with our lesson for friday night: SKATE AND DESTROY! LETS ALL BAND TOGETHER AND USE OUR MIGHT TO VANQUISH THE EVIL AND SAVE THE ALMIGHTY PISTY! And saturday was the same. skate and walk all night with the crew. most fun i will have in a long time. and today was study day.... ALL FUCKING DAY. o well. and reading this i see its disorganization. whatever. Peace. i'm out"

"event","Update again. Well I'm bringing the old ska band together slowly, looking for a good bassist and a commited drummer due to musical differences. Also, I would like to point out that people suck, and therefor no one should bother me with their personal problems while I'm doing something clearly taking thought, like Geometry, or Skateboarding..... just a quick reminder. Anywhos, nothing else has happened, except I've skated so much my feet are all blisters and I can barely walk...  boo-yeah. Thats about it. Later you crazy kids.

All the time i'm just out, I need to be better, I need to be one of the best. I'm still new to it, but getting better fast. I don't really know whats up with it, but its so much fun. And besides that its been the punk band. Name changes are constant, so maybe soon, we'll know, I'm not sure. Dosn't matter, but if anyones out tomorrow, you'll see me on my board, I'll be around. Yell if you see me, cause I get bored. Later For Now."

I'll be trying around 20 different looks for this thing, tell me when I get one right. And the blue hair thing I'm holding off on, I'm just going to let it grow until its rediculous, and unmanageble. Which will be soon. And for some reason, patches of blonde have sprung up, no reason. I don't even ask anymore... o well. I'm done.

And Seth's party was the shiznik, or whatever else you stupid kids would say. I'm only updating cause Matt is a pain in the ass about this. So I'm just summing up things to please the Fat-Man and Little Boy. Now I'm just rambeling. But soon, Golgotha will not suck, and that will be a massively important turning point. Ramble....

"event","My life is so awesome right now. Everything has fallen into its place. Well today, school was quick, as usual. So that was cool, and when I got home, my ticket to Reel Big Fish came in the mail. That was even better. I practiced my guitar, and my trombone, so I feel confident in my musical areas. Whooptie-doo. And I printed tasha's paper for her, and I'm not sure why. O well, took way too long though.
Well this has become tirering, so I must stop. Later loser-readers.

"event","Who knew a container clearly labeled ""KEEP AWAY FROM FLAME"" could explode? Because I sure didn't. Now I have burns on my arm, but it was worth it. Ehh.... anyway, my life has shaped up in the last weeks. Made Honor Roll this quarter, pretty good. Made my parents happy by doing chores, and I met someone I actually like as a person. Looks like this vacation will pretty much rock too. Reel Big Fish and going to Boston like 3 times will be killer. Anyway, I was feeling awesome until Sal sent me a picture of himself naked.... what in god's name was that.... On to somehting else.... like me leaving to cut out my eyes... Later all.

"event","One of the best days of my life. I worked in the morning, easy day too, except for a rental that came back. The outside and the interior were spotless, but when I checked the spare tire, I laughed for 5 minutes at what I found. There was about 1 1/2 gallons of SOY SAUCE in the hub for the tire.... just sitting there.... fermenting. Smelt bad, but made for hilarity when my co-worker came in late, and I asked him if he could pop the trunk and grab the window washer i left inside. And later in the afternoon, me, scott, matt and lil' galli headed down to havard sq.... which was the greatest time I've had in months. So yesterday was awesome, and today I'm sick.... so it all equals out.

Because I know, even at my lowest, I could not be a worse loser than the 34 year old working the wash-stand and Sticker machine. Such an up lifter. Especially when said employee gets his ass kicked in during his lunch break. O, what a day. And only 9 more days until Reel Big Fish.... so awesome. Time to jet. Later fools that read this."

But, eh, money is money, and this will be quick and easy work tomorrow. Whatever, I plan to mill around with people the rest of the day. Hopefully that works out. But I can't complain either way. It's still a day of 0 school. What fun! Well, I guess I'm done. Just need to update like I have a reason.

"event","I just noticed how fast time is passing. Its already fourth quarter. My grades are ehhh, so I have a feeling this quarter is going to suck. I don't care anymore about things. But at least I learned valuable life lessons, like skateboarding is more important than school and haki sak is also as important. And more important lessons, like that ticket master is a price raising nazi group for ska concert tickets.... $25 bucks for reel big fish tickets..... HIGH WAY ROBBERY! Still paid it though.... Eh, concert will own up to the price. Well I'm done complaining. Awesome.

"event","So, today totally sucked. Got up, went to church, and after that started work on the bottom of my custom skate board. Spent over 4 hours sanding and painting, and now its drying.. should be a while. Then Tony Hawk Underground entertained me until Confirmation class, which was super retarded today. Maybe this day will end soon..... So boring. And sal just sumed up something everyso important.

I got new shoes, which is ehhh, cause I liked my old ones better, but the bottom ripped off while I was boarding. My Dad keeps telling me to go to sleep cause we lose an hour with clocks going back, but I don't think that he knows that I don't really sleep... And Anna has yet again proved she is a ""tard."" I'm going to jet now, I want to shine the new skate shoes I got. DC SHOES are so fucking awesome. Later, thanks for wasting your time. It sure is worth it, now isn't it?

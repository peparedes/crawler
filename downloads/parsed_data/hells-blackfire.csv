"event","&nbsp;I haven't used this for journaling in a while... well I haven't journaled really at all so I'm realizing that I should get back into it because i really need it. &nbsp;So for those who are reading this, it is a bunch of complaints, sighs, rambling and ranting.

Well, I am 18 and finally graduated. I finally begin college in late September which reminds me, I need to find out when to take my placement test... grr i'm not sure what to do because I took the AP english test but I need to call my college and figure that out.

So... i've been dating Josh for almost two years, our anniversary is on the 26th of July but i'm not even sure if we'll make it... I have high hopes but the relationship has been... rocky to say the least. We've been good for the last few days but unfortunately I kiss him every night like it's going to be my last kiss with him because that may very well be the case. I just don't know anymore because he doesn't know if he loves me more than a friend or what but he fights to keep me with him. I don't know what to say, what to feel, if I should move out. I'm so so so lost because I love him and in no way want to give him up but what do I do?

Ok, enough with the relationship drama. I'm very happily living in oregon though and I'm excited about all the possibilities with college, new people, rugby, it's exciting but I wonder if it's really what's best for me. *sighs* I really want what the college offers because it's what I want to major in but I need beaches, sun, and amusment parks lol

Ok, I think that's enough for now. I just needed to take care of stuff and rant"

"event","&nbsp;Wow, I'm going to graduate this year. this is a very scary and intimidating thought. Anyways today I took my finals and my last two are tomorrow and then it's on to 2 AP&nbsp;classes, drama, and AVID blegh. For the last month or so, I have been rehearsing for a play where, originally I was the woman murdered but now I am the murderer. Our play is NEXT week and I have over 200 lines to memorize by then and I just got my role last monday!!! Now I have play rehearsal even on days I don't have school when I want to be SLEEPING!&nbsp;I'm tired EVERY night I come home and don't want to get out of bed the next morning. I just hope we can pull this together because&nbsp;we are REALLY far behind but i'm excited because it is an AWESOME&nbsp;play. The name is Bright Ideas by an man name... cole I believe. I play the main role Genevra and only have 1 brief scene that i'm NOT it. TIRING!!&nbsp;WANT&nbsp;SLEEP!! And I have work, volunteer service, and school on top of it.

I'm still in Oregon and won't be home until the beginning of august and soon after my senior registration I will be in Santa Cruz until the 16th, and start school on the 17th. I'm rather intimidated by the fact I'm a senior in highschool now and I'm applying for college this fall, SCARY!!!! Now my sleeping schedule is weird because I'm used to waking up at 5 to work lol. Just in time for school. It's nice to be home... well in one of my homes but I'll admit, sleeping in a bed is very strange.

"event","I have to go to a funeral next weekend sadly. My uncle Raymond died at the end of December, much to the surprise, relief, and disbelief for my family. I will have some support but it will still be hard to attend. I'm leaving on bus next Friday and remain through Sunday. I was unfortunate to learn of the new while I was staying with Josh and his mother in Oregon. 

Now, onto happier subjects. I passed with straight A's last term but I think I'm burning out. Anyway, I have a prom dress now. It's really beautiful, my mom is letting me borrow it.&nbsp; Now I just have to slim down and tone a few things and it'll look great on me. This will take a while =D Thats fine with me, more motivation to go to the gym and lift weights. Necessary for track.

Josh will be visiting from Thursday til Sunday next week, much to my delight. I'm just sad it is not under better circumstances.

Plus, I would be be paying 2 hundred sum odd dollars for three days where I could pay about $140 and stay for a whole week. I&nbsp;can actually AFFORD&nbsp;the lesser amount. I can't afford over $200. I'm not that rich. It just seems like nothing I say is helping. I realize she's a mother and she she's trying to look out for my safety but I'll be 18 in less than 2 years. She needs to let me go. I do more dangerous stuff in my everyday life than taking a bus. sheesh."

I am now a white/yellow belt in Taekwondo. I have also become a member of the blackbelt club, which means I will be presented my outfit, sparring gear, weapons, and bag next week, I am so excited. I had a tournament today and&nbsp;won first place in forms for my division, my brother won 5th, of course, he was against more kids and there seems to be some favoritism. He did VERY well and I am very proud of him. He was one of the sharper students there. I had the hard-ass, though, I got an 8.2 which is pretty high for him.

I have read the whole twilight series and saw the movie as well. so far, I like the series, the movie was ok, prefer the books. Now I'm reading another vampire book by my favorite&nbsp; authors. After I&nbsp;finish this one, I need to read my summer reading books for english before mid-january. Shouldn't be a problem since after next week, I have a two week break. I can read them then. 

Trying to find a way to get to Oregon after christmas&nbsp; to visit my boyfriend. I will be in Santa Cruz Christmas Eve I hope so maybe I can visit some people beforeI leave. Then I can deliver some presents. I have made a lot of art&nbsp; projects and presents for people. Pots, bowls, angels, and such. They came out quite well so far.

Anyway, there's a brief update."

"event","Well, these last two weeks seem to be accident and pain prone for me. In the last two weeks, I have managed to cut my thumb with a knife, slice my finger on someones figure skates, burn my palm, have ovulation pain (doctor's theory), get three shots, sore muscles, somewhat fought me (I will elaborate later in this post), sprained my neck (due to the fight), and get a bump on my head (also due to the fight).

The sore muscles were actually because of Taekwondo and them working for 6 hours or so right after wards. 

Cuts, well, pretty much self explanatory. Along with the burn, I was cooking.

Ovulation pain, something that has been reoccuring for about 7 months or so.&nbsp; I have been in the ER twice for it. And they just NOW, on my check up today in the doctor's office,&nbsp; guessed that it was due to my ovulation... oh joy. 7 months of pain, two visits to the ER and it's during a regular check up that they figure it out. The shots were also during my doctor's appointment. HPV vaccine, Meningitis, and the Flu shot. My arms are a tad sore.

Now, for the fight. It wasn't really a fight considering I didn't fight back, which I got many props for. I just didn't want to get suspended. What happened was, I was trying to get to my sister's friend to ask if I could borrow a book. I guess I accidentally bumped into a girl because she started to push me and say &quot;Excuse me&quot; and &quot;Excuse you bitch&quot; and others along those lines.&nbsp; As I was leaving, to provide a little more distance, I was pushed her away from me, not hard. As I was walking, she ran up behind me, grabbed my hair, yanked my head down (making my backpack weigh down on my neck, hence the sprain, (speed and weight are not friendly on one's neck),&nbsp; and she punched me about 5-6 times before letting me go. I got my food (fries and marinara sauce), all in my hair, on my clothes, and my backpack. Which made me upset because I was eating it.&nbsp;She was arrested because a cop and the Vice-Principal were there and had seen the whole thing. She was charged with assault and will be going to court for it. No big deal. But, because of my head and neck, my boss sent me home to rest and I could work that day.

Anyway, recent update on my life."

"event","The conference was a lot of fun and definitely worth going to. One thing I really enjoyed, aside from the presentations, was that you could actually go up to the speaker at some point and chat with them and you could see them walking around as if they were just another person attending the conference. And they had a variety of speakers. Different races/ethnicities, lifestyle, jobs, ages, and just their background it general. It was really awesome and I like that there were youth speakers and various performances as well. They held a dance as well, and it was quite shocking seeing how the adults were dancing. I never knew that people above the age of 19 danced like they were teenagers. <br />On that note, they people at the conference were quite enjoyable and it was really funny when Josh and I received a cd for kissing. People there definitely reminded me of Santa Cruz because they all dressed as they wanted and it was almost like everyone knew everyone. They weren't all up tight, if anything ,they were loose and willing to accept new things. And funny enough, a lot of people were&nbsp;actually from&nbsp;Santa&nbsp;Cruz.&nbsp;I loved it and the trup was really worth it. <br />The food was awesome as well, they had vegan food mostly and it was sooo tasty. I was definitely eating a lot healthier. <br />The only sad part was, i never got around to studying. <br />I liked living with Josh for the 4 days as well. We worked out things financially, tried to come to a consensus about what we wanted to do or what workshop to go to, calming each other down when they were upset, so on and so forth. I really truly enjoyed my weekend and am looking forward to going next year if the oppurtonity arises.<br />I was also able to talk to <lj user=""violetclm"">&nbsp; at some point and we had a very enjoyable conversation. It was nice being able to talk to him as a friend and not someone I was crushing on =D"

He arrived Friday while<em>&nbsp;</em>I was at school so he came to the rally, hung out during lunch, and went to the park until after school. He didn't leave until Sunday night and it was really nice to see him. It was also really nice to have a date to homecoming.

I must admit, these were probably the best 4 days of my life. We were&nbsp;often out an about.&nbsp;We went to the beach, walked along the cliffs, took lots and lots of pictures&nbsp;that I will have up as soon as I get the CDs from him.&nbsp;(we had to use his cord to get the pictures of my camera, so they are all on his&nbsp;laptop.) We also went to the boardwalk and hiked up at Big Basin with my sister. I woke about 6:30 - 8 everymorning, got ready, and walked to my uncle's house every morning since that was where he was staying. I had a lot of fun. My whole family, excluding my parents and brother since they&nbsp;are in Sacramento and were not here to meet him, took a very strong liking to Josh.&nbsp;Even more so than to <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://violetclm.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://violetclm.livejournal.com/""><b>violetclm</b></a></div>&nbsp;much to my suprise and delight. We would be together from 7:30&nbsp;or so in the morning to about midnight everyday he was here. My sister has officially dubbed Josh as her Nii-San (older brother) and&nbsp;has high hopes from him being her brother-in-law.&nbsp;Though, highly doubtful in my opinion. We spent most of our morning and nights cuddling and talking which was a lot of fun.<br /><br />It was kind of funny when he left because just the night before, we had been joking about&nbsp;calling a bomb threat so that the train would be late. Well, it turns out, the train was about 3&nbsp;1/2 hours late because some one in Sacramento stepped out in front of the train, and I have to admit, I was not at all suprised that it&nbsp;happened in Sacramento. Then, another person was hit by another train and we were tempted just to leave and put&nbsp;him on the train the next day, but alas, that didn't&nbsp;happen since we didn't know what was going on. I have to admit, it is very weird not having him here. It&nbsp;was a really long, drawn out&nbsp;4 days, in a good way. My whole family is trying to find ways for him to spend more time with us. lol.<br /><br />Anyway, there is an update of the last 5 days for me.&nbsp;"

"event","Well, we went to South Lake Tahoe for the 4th and ended up having a great time. Unfortunately, now we all feel like we've been drinking over the last couple of days. We are&nbsp;sore to our bones. We carried a lot of things around and at a high altitude that we're not used to&nbsp;anymore. We found out that over exerting yourself, not eating too much, and not drinking to much from 11am to 11 pm is not going to make your body too&nbsp;happy. We didn't eat anything warm (or heavy) til about midnight and&nbsp;didn't leave&nbsp;So. Lake Tahoe til about 1:30 this morning. Luckily we made good time coming home so we arrived at the apartments at 3:30.

Now, to&nbsp;start with the fun details. I finally got to see my uncle and cousin Zen, they still look the same suprisingly, aside from the fact my uncle has gotten quite a few&nbsp;grey hairs in the last couple of years. We spent quite a bit of time&nbsp;in the lake, thus the sore shoulders and legs. We spent about the first hour claiming our stake for the family though lol. My sister and I&nbsp;also went back and forth carrying the baby while the adults were busy. &nbsp;There was a lot of sleeping too since most of us woke up at either 4 or 6 in the morning, but that was mostly between my baby cousin and my sister. The rest of us couldn't really get to sleep. We also had a guy come up and us for some food, and offered some money but we didn't take any. There was a lot of people drinking alchohol near us. I mean, kegs, coolers ful of cans of beer, etc... My siblings, cousin,&nbsp;and I actually played a little soccer with some of the people sitting near us. When there were complaints of us kicking up a lot of dust, we had to stop. Then we just taught a guy named Garret some Taekwondo and had fights. Safe sparing for the most part, so&nbsp;nobody was injured. I hung out with the people we played soccer with and had quite a bit of fun. All of them were either finishing or had finished college and offered my some beer. (I refused for two reasons, beer tastes nasty in my opinion and I didn't want my dad getting angry at me, the family was no more than five feet away) There was a lot of picture taking and laughing. Both times we came from or went to the car, I had to carry Franky, which I didn't mind too much, he can be a little fussy though. He was asleep on the way to car and it was hard finding a comfortable position. My blanket was used a little bit and now it smells like beer. There was some crying and comforting going around, not by my family but my friend Jigs' girl was having problems. There was quite a bit of dancing and recording of dances.

I managed to take pictures throughout the whole day and I have videos of the firework show that I will get up when I have a computer with a working usb port along with internet."

"event","As most of you know, I am in Santa Cruz as of the 8th of June, and things have been, shall we say wonky? Though I LOVE being in Santa Cruz and the people who live here, I have begun to miss the comfort of my own home and friends. It is different being friends with people than being friends with people and actually hanging out for large amounts of time. I realize that I only see my friends here in Santa Cruz during two parts of the year due to schooling and other such nonsense, but it seems to put a dampener and strain on a friendship. In Sacramento, I have two or three friends that I would hang out with almost every day after school for hours on end and they would even come visit me when I didn't have work on the weekends. Most people know that I would be willing to put my life on the line for my friends, but I know for a FACT that these three friends on mine would take the life of anyone who hurt me or risk their own lives to protect me. These people are my best friends, my brothers, and my family all in the same because of what we mean to each other. That is the difference between these friends and the ones I have in Santa Cruz. I would risk injury to help a friend, but I doubt they would do the same for me because we really don't share that deep of a bond, well except for one person but I am going to exclude him from this topic for now. No offense to my Santa Cruz friends, I hope  that you will not take this to heart or offensively,  it just means that we either need to have more contact or just stay the way we are if we're happy. 

Zach Flynn, Kenji Scotts, and Jeff Ashby, I miss you guys and I plan to be home soon so don't worry, I just won't be home as soon as you would like =D"

I have somehow managed to become the assistant coach on the Track team along with actually being a team member. Reason being that we have no one who can teach us how to throw diskus and shot put which makes things... slightly difficult. Vitaly and me are the only ones who really know what to do but I ended being landed with the duty of teaching and coaching. I honestly don't know whether I should be honored or insulted but I'll take it as a good thing. For some reason, I ended up running with the sprinters but I'm a long distance runner, what a pain.&nbsp;I really dislike my coach because he is almost never there so where have to rely on the other coach who doesn't really know what he is doing but something is better than nothing right?<br /><br />On top of that, my alarm clock got set ahead and hour and my sister and I ended up waking up and 5 minutes to 5 instead of 5 minutes to 6. It was rather frustrating but we managed to get things worked out so we didn't wind up going to everything an hour early, which was good but now I'm tired and want to sleep now but I haven't eaten and it's only 15 to 7, blegh.&nbsp;<br /><br />But one thing has managed to go well, my best friend Brock showed up and I got to hang out with him a little while so it was worth it.</p>"

"event","<p>Something I've never been good at when it comes to myself. If I'm in pain, I won't admit to it. If I like someone, I won't tell the truth. This is probably one of my biggest faults because even though the person I'm with may know I'm lying, I won't admit to it. Now, I have to because it will come out eventually, but when I can tell the truth to the man I've been lying to for so long? When you lie to someone, it's hard to finally come out and tell the truth and that is where I am stuck. I'm afraid he'll hate me for lying for so long to him and that we will no longer be friends and that he will want nothing to do with me. This could be just an infamous teenage moment but it still worries me. To a teenager, their friend's are their lives pretty much and it's hard to lose a really good friend. So what do you do to prevent that when you've been lying/denying the truth?</p>"

I have&nbsp;Track&nbsp;practice and 10:30. On monday I'm&nbsp;going with my employer to her job at&nbsp;Martin Luther King Middle School, chores, homework, watching my siblings here and there, washing the car, cooking dinner since both of my parents are either working or attending classes, and on top of all that I'm working. It is just the loveliest&nbsp;schedule and I am unable to get away. I have to attend Track because I have a meet on the Wednesday after break along with studying for mid-terms, which happen on the Thursday and Friday after my meet.&nbsp;It seems though that I won't be able to go to Santa Cruz this week much to my disappointment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last two of our meets have been canceled to our benefit considering we are still a pretty far way from being able to compete with a certain amount of ability considering how small our team is. The first meet was canceled due to the face that we are no longer allowed the usage of the track field at Yuba City College, the reason why is still a mystery to most of us on the team since our coach won't provide us with an answer and most of us know that we were able to use it last year. The second meet was canceled to to the fact that the Track and Lindhurst was not yet finished. So we've gotten lucky so far.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also able to talk to&nbsp; <font color=""#0000cc""><strong><u>VioletClm </u></strong>a</font>nd I have to admit that is was nice to talk to him. I had actually called the night before to apologize for lying about him to a guy I had hitch-hiked with on Friday. I was desperate to get home on time and the buses were not doing me any favor so&nbsp;I hitch-hiked and luckily I am still here. But we talked and I was unhappy to hear that he was not able to eat due to the lack of being able to obtain food at the time so I'm hoping things have gotten better so far.&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><font color=""#000000""><br /></font></div>"

"event","Track started on&nbsp;Monday and I'm happy but the&nbsp;main problem is that we only have TEN people on the track team. Not many people are&nbsp;very fond of Coach Mitch so nobody wants to come out. Last year, we had at least 49 people come out for track, back when it was coached by Coach J but he was transferred. Much to the dismay of people on Cross-Country and Track. Plus,&nbsp;most are lazy so they just don't WANT to come out because they are afraid that it is too much work. To this&nbsp;point I am the only girl on the track&nbsp;team which means&nbsp;that the girls have a very&nbsp;low chance of actually winning this year. &nbsp;This does not please me at all, it actually rather irritates me. Last year we only had 6 girls, and one was very lazy, so we didn't win at ALL. I find it much easier to run, one, when my legs aren't so sore that I can't walk, and two, when I'm listening to music. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to listen to music while actually competing. Oh well, get everything. 

I also recently found out that I can still read music for violas. I was very happy. I haven't played the viola for a couple of years now, so I was worried that I couldn't read the music in case I ever get a viola of my own. The only reason I was in viola was because we had an orchestra in elementary as well as in middle school. Since I am no longer attending either of them anymore, I am left without a viola in my possession. I would buy one, if they weren't so expensive. What a problem. Luckily, if there is a time when I am provided with a viola, I still have some previous music to warm up to."

It will be rather... awkward considering that many of these people bear grudges from middle school or even elementary school. But considering I don't want to sit around all day and wait for the time to pass by, I'm going to go and visit people. Last time, I was trying to come across one specific friend but ended up S.O.L. I'm hoping to see this friend as well as my ""little"" sister. The irony in&nbsp;this is that she is a good friend of mine who only happens to be four days younger than me. Yet she still seems to have the heart of&nbsp; an 6-8 year old. Thus being my ""little"" sister. She is absolutely adorable though. Her innocence is something I have admired since we met in the 7th grade. She is one I hope to see. There is also my ""cousin"" and my friend Marcelus that I would like to see. My cousin is actually just another friend that I've known since about the 3rd grade. It's funny who I consider family just but they all have their titles for certain reasons. Just as my friend Zach is considered a brother, much to his dismay.

Anyway, I'm not sure how well or how badly this will turn out but I hopefully won't get into a fight or dispute with anyone and have to retreat to the light rail station in means of running home."

"event","Valentine's day&nbsp;has come and gone but the sickness I had managed to pick up slightly beforehand has stuck with me. It is very annoying to have a cough for so long, especially if it&nbsp;is the main cause of a soar throat and inability to speak. Otherwise, I have enjoyed these past several days. No rain which is a bit of a disappointment but at least I don't have to worry about having muddy pants every day I walk to the bus stop.&nbsp; 

I find it funny how often I use the bus nowadays. Before the summer of 2006, around the time I met violetclm, I had almost NEVER used the bus system. I didn't know how they ran, how much to pay, or any of that stuff. It was kind of foreign to me. Lo and behold, I met Violetclm, Matisse, and&nbsp;Morgayn. I had to take the bus to get to the house of the Madrones and home again. Then, I started taking the bus to get&nbsp;places to meet&nbsp;violetclm and, in the process, meeting his family here and there. I began to take the bus every so often to get home from&nbsp;school because, to my convenience, the bus runs right by my apartment complex. Then, I took a trip down to&nbsp;Santa Cruz and would take the bus to once again get into contact with friends. The summer of 2007 rolled around and I found myself on the bus quite often. Whether&nbsp;taking the highway 17 bus to get to&nbsp;Santa Cruz from the San Jose train station, going to meet friends downtown, or take the&nbsp;previously mentioned bus back to San Jose to go to Vancouver with violetclm, broccolipwns, and pyrzqxgl. But, as it had been so before hand,&nbsp; the bus was just back up transportation if I was unable to recieve a ride or bike. Now, as it seems that my bike was stolen a few months ago, it happens to be my main means of transportation to school and back home. How interesting the things that were so strange in your life can change by meeting a few people. The bus is no longer a strange vehicle I would see pass me when going places but a lovely convenience that helps me get around as I listen to a cacophony of sounds due to flu season. I doubt I'll be taking the bus very much this week since I have the whole week off from school and seminary. A little vacation is what I need but alas, all of my friends in Santa Cruz will most likely still have school so I'm stuck at home. Oh well, I will turn to finding a vacation in the pages of my favorite books, away from family."

Today, I took extreme pleasure out of dropping hot cheetos into my brother's mouth from the&nbsp;first floor of our apartments. He, of&nbsp;course, stood on the&nbsp;pavement as he tried to keep cheetos from bouncing off his head or going into his nose. We managed to get 6 Cheetos, in a row,&nbsp;into his mouth. Our neighbor Nathan, a boy who has befriended my brother as well as myself, had fun telling me ""you should drop some from the 2nd floor"" which I refused considering that fact that I was already wasting enough cheetos from the 1st floor. I think I only at about a quarter to half of my bag of cheetos while the rest either ended in my brother's gaping jaws or on the ground (which he ended picking up later and probably ate them but I haven't asked.) All in all, it was entertaining and it tasted good in the end."

"event","To my great dismay, I have recently learned that my best friend at Encina is smoking weed. I am disappointed&nbsp;in her,&nbsp;but my disappointment is nowhere near &nbsp;the hurt I feel about her lying to me. She would tell me how her best friend would always smoke and when I asked if she did, she would say no or nothing at all. The other day, as I&nbsp;was approaching the gates to the school grounds, I saw her, Blanca, and Cherise walking to them walking to the entrance at the back of the school, (the same entrance in which I enter every morning whether I arrive by driver or bus). This is the same place where the smokers are located. The smoke both regular cigarretes as well as weed but I didn't think much of this because I trusted her. It turns out I was very much decieved. Cherise was later talking about how Jackie no longer felt the strange effects of weed because she had been smoking for a while. My response was ""Jackie is smoking WEED!?"" Cherise nodded and said ""yes but don't tell her I told you. She didn't want you to know."" The felt like someone had just stabbed me in the heart and I'm still hurt by that. I understand that Jackie is going through things in her life that are causing a negative effect on her life and that she isn't hanging with very positive people, but I wish she could have found an alternative.&nbsp;

Later, in my health class, I told Zach what I had learned and he looks at me and asks ""the girl with the glasses"" and when I nod this is the answer I recieved. ""Oh she's there all the time, everyone knew that."" WHAT! Help&nbsp; m please. And then I realized that almost all of my friends does drugs, smokes, or drinks alchohol in a harmful way. I wanted to curl up into a ball and cry and scream and not face everyone. I told my dad, naming all of my friends that I knew did these things and said ""this is why I want to be in Santa Cruz."" almost all of my friends do not do any of those things except for one that I've known since I was eight. I was really sad and hurt by all of this and am shying away from those that are doing drugs and stuff. I really can't face them at this point."

We are in the computer lab that&nbsp;apparently&nbsp; has internet. This&nbsp;new semester is going to be rather interesting I can tell. I have almost everyone from my Honors English class and AVID class in my Honors, Health, and AVID class this semester. These people are going to be in most of my highschool life. 

I have new friend now. Her name is Mickell and oddly enough, she is my best friend Brock's sweetheart. Despite not having met eachother in person, we're already asking eachother for advice and talking about matters of the heart. This friendship reminds me a lot of my friendship with Becky but Mickell is a LOT closer and Brock knows her because she lives near his dad's house. Hopefully I will find the time and the transportation method to go down to Elk Grove to visit her. I have my doubts about whether or not this will happen any time soon but hey, hope for the best expect the worst right?&nbsp;

Unfortunately, my friends seem to expect the worst. Lately, I have been having some stomach trouble. I cannot eat a lot because my stomach can't handle it and sometimes... rejects the food. I also have a heightened sense of smell and taste. I can now taste and smell things I would not have regularly noticed, and most of it is unpleasant. Apparently, this adds up to being pregnant. My friends all assume that I am pregnant and I am not even sexually active! My dear friend Zach said that he will either knee me in the stomach or feed me seaweed to make me have a miscarriage if I am pregnant. That kind of upsets me because he would basically be murdering my child and that is not a pleasant thought. This is also the THIRD time someone has assumed I am pregnant because of a malfunction of a body part or pain in a specific area, such as my abdomen. It is getting rather irritating."

I have been&nbsp; pumping myself full of drugs to get rid of the pain for that last two days and nothing helps. That is just plain rediculous.&nbsp;

Another bit of information that boggled me out of my mind. My good friend Angelique has been engaged for about 2 months or so, but the first couple of weeks she had absolutely no idea who it was that she was engaged to. All she knew was that is was the brother or cousing of her ex. Well, she met him finally and I kept hearing about him and on Thursday I got to meet him. It was my friend Ben from the 8th grade. ""WHAT THE-"" was my initial reaction. I asked him why he was at my school and told me that his girlfriend went here. Well, when I found out I nearly lost it because it was just so weird. Here was the play boy who was never serious about girls and treated them badly, also the guy that used to dip and kiss me while I was dating my ex Johnny. (just a kiss on the cheek but I basically stayed in the shower for an hour scrubbing the area in which he had kissed me.)&nbsp;

It seems that someone chose to make my fate a little interesting by re-introducing people from my past years in middle-school into my highschool years. He is not the first person this year, my friend Zach also came this year. These were all friends from the 7th and 8th grade that I NEVER thought I was going to see again and here they are. Life is so weird. Well, there's my little bit of highschool drama for the day."

We met up at University and 65th which happens to be the second closest stop to my house. We sat in silence pretty much the whole way, we reached 16th street and transfered to the Meadowview lightrail. Half way there Jeremiah sees one of his friends and moves to go talk to them and i just stared out the window not paying them any heed. We get off at florin and catch a bus to get to the library where we were supposed to meet his cousins Dishaun and Jojo. Jojo still has the hots for my sister and Dishaun is just plan scared of me so he wasn't to thrilled to see me. We hang out for a couple of hours, the two older boys are on the computer while I read or talk to Jojo, who seemed to like to push the book i was reading in my face. I hadn't eaten all day except for a couple pieces of candy provided by Jeremiah, so i'm pretty hungry but not really saying anything because i was flat broke. I only had enough to pay for a bus transfer. Once we reach the apartment where Jeremiah lives, i am immediately put to the duty of changing baby Jame's diaper. I watch James for a while before having to defend myself and Jeremiah from the attacks of a 1 yr old, 1 1/2 yr old, and a 2 yr old who happen to be very violent and strong. It seemed that their favorite activity was to beat up on Jeremiah, and then me once they realized I would fight back and seemed to be a reasonable challenge &gt;.&lt; I didn't mind fighting them since mostly i just picked them up and threw them on the couch(not literally). I was supposed to get a ride home from Jeremiah's mom in time to go to the Forgotten Carols performance and my church but unfortunately she didn't get back till 6:30 and had to leave again, before complaining that she had no room in her car. I ended up having to spend the night. I had to go against&nbsp; my normal wanting of NOT eating at people's houses, until i get more comfortable coming over and becoming aquainted with everyone,&nbsp; and had to eat dinner which really didn't consist of very much but it was something. I did more fighting with the kids and ended up having to put a couple to sleep. The boys didn't actually let me get to sleep til 3 or 4 in the morning and i woke up at 7.&nbsp;The biggest issue was the it was fast sunday and i couldn't do it because i would have passed out because of how little i had eaten. Go figure.<br /><br />We had to be at my house by noon because i had to go to work. So we catch the bus and the lightrail back the University and 65th, we have missed the 26. We decide to catch the 87 which runs down howe ave, I'm thinking ""hey, i live on howe so maybe it will pass my house."" So we get on and it goes onto the freeway towards the arden area, we reach hurley at noon and i ask dishaun to go ask the bus driver when we will pass fair oaks because i realize the bus is going in the OPPOSITE direction.The driver says that he won't pass fair oaks so we get off. We have to walk 2 miles to my house, on empty stomachs, at a fast pace, so i can get to work by 12:45, which we made but just barely. My stomach was not happy, it hurt the WHOLE walk home. I could barely eat and keep food down. I was not thrilled about this. Everything ended up working out in the end, i ate, my friends ate on their way home, and i worked. </p>"

"event","I saw my best friend Jeremiah aka Nnedishue on Saturday and i was really happy. I had not seem jeremiah for over a YEAR so i was just tickled pink. it is really nice to see friends that you haven't seen in a while. We had a lot&nbsp;of fun, my family was just thrilled to see him as well. I swear sometimes i think my family likes him&nbsp;more than i do which is weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;We took my siblings and Nathan to the park, then we went for a walk and talked on some rocks near the river, than went to a small&nbsp;beach next to the river later on with my siblings and Nathan. I went into the water and swam around, tried to ignore a pervert&nbsp;who was kayaking by, and tried to avoid clay clumps being&nbsp;aimed at&nbsp;my head. The water was cold but the worst part was getting OUT of the river, i was FREEZING!&nbsp; I wanted to stay in the river because it was so cold. Luckily i am not sick.<br /><br />My&nbsp;thanksgiving was very&nbsp;good as well. We had&nbsp;<strong>11</strong> people&nbsp;in the house, and we have a small apartment. It was me, my grandma nancy, the family friend Marsha, my uncle Adam, my grandma Carla, my cousin Robert,&nbsp;and the rest of the family. It was a bit crowded but my mom's food&nbsp;was delicious, especially her deserts. YUM!<br />&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Yeah thats what i said, another hair cut. Actually, i really did. My hair is above my shoulders now i and bet that my friends in Sacramento are going to want to kill me. I just got fed up of long hair so i took some scissors and cut off my ponytail. It's probably a little uneven but hey, it works. i prefer short hair anyway. Normally i like REALLY short hair like above my ears short (or boyish short whatever) but considering i have a lack in experience regarding cutting hair, i just cut off what i knew would make it look somewhat good. My family doesn't know and they won't know until wednesday approximately. My grandma and uncle know but now my parents of siblings.</p>"

"event","<p>Homecoming was actually a lot better than i thought i would be. There wasn't as many people as last year, but a lot more people were in dresses and suits. Most of my friends were...awed at the fact i was wearing a dress and what not.&nbsp;Dancing was fun and i managed to get some of my friends dancing (though i must admit, some really need to work on their rhythm.) I managed to get allyson jealous which was actually quite amusing. Here is the story:<br /><br />Allyson decided to make her boyfriend Ricky jealous by dancing with Roni. She specifically asked me to keep Ricky away which i agreed to and succeeded to do. Yet instead of fighting me after the first couple of tries we ourselves danced in a ballroom style which happened to be very fun. There was a lot of spinning, twirling, etc... I had mentioned to Ricky that i found it amusing to make allyson jealous and he said he could do much more to make her jealous. We did a few more twirls before he dipped me. This set allyson off, she immediately broke away from Roni to take back Ricky, calling me a traitor. I just laughed and went to dance with Roni.<br /><br />Unfortunately I almost ended up passing out from being overheated but that passed rather quickly.<br /><br />As for pictures, it turns out that they were free and you could take as many as you pleased, to a certain extent obviously. I took three with myself and one other by my side and i think i took about 5 with groups of people. I should have those pictures by...monday. Mr. Levis will give us disks containing the pictures. If you want me to burn you a copy with the pictures please let me know so i know how many copies to burn. Also, please give me your home address so that i can mail the CD to you. I already have <a href=""http://pyrzqxgl.livejournal.com/""><b>pyrzqxgl</b></a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=""http://violetclm.livejournal.com/""><b>violetclm</b></a>&nbsp; addresses.</p>"

"event","Homecoming is tomorrow on the 27th. Today if your reading this on Saturday. It is going to be so strange.&nbsp;A dress, earrings, heels, make up, my hair will be up in a fancy braided bun and slightly curled, and maybe a shawl or pretty shirt over the top. I'm going to look really weird i'm actually kind of scared. I mean, &nbsp;i've dressed up slightly before, but nothing like this. I don't even think i can pull it off, i'm actually so scared and nervous that i might not go at all. I have to go to the set up but, i just might go home and stay home ya know. I didn't even go this far for my graduation/promotion from middle school. All i did was have my hair down and wear a dress, that was it. Ugh, i don't even know why i'm doing so much for one dance, when i've never done anything like this before...except for halloween for some reason hehe.&nbsp;

Ok, aside from the homecoming dance, i bet anything that our team is going to lose but i'm hoping and praying that they won't. I mean, it IS our homecoming game.&nbsp;

This was how my week went since it was homecoming week after all. and red ribbon week, aka drug and alcohol free week so it was pretty busy.

Monday was nerd day but since i forgot i did not have any participation in this whatsoever. Though those who dressed up either look extremely good or extremely goofy.

Tuesday was crazy day. I dressed up as an asian princess with side of my hair in a bun the other half in a ponytail with my butterfly pin and beads. Then i was wearing witch socks haha pretty crazy huh?

Wednesday was twin day, i went to school with no twin and found out that i had an unintentional twin. We both had a black jacket, white shirt, black pants, and white shoes with ankle socks. Main difference was our different racial status and she had her hair down and mine was up as usual. It was pretty cool to have a twin though.

Thursday was twerp day which is where you dress up as the opposite sex. For the whole day i was Daniel not Danielle. This boy dan was Danielle for the day haha. He was wearing an unexpected piece of clothing though *shudders* I screamed every time i saw a guy dressed as a girl because it was REALLY disturbing. some guys when as far as to stuff a bra with tissue. Luckily i wore my normal clothes which happen to be very boyish. Most of the girls looked like boy gangsters.

And Friday was rally day, i was in a competition where i had to pop balloons with my feet to find the red ribbon. I ended up playing soccer with one of the guys for the last balloon and my friends saw for the first time why a lot of people want me to be on the soccer team :( and i despise soccer.

Also my bike is having issues, the brakes are giving me issues because my tires are slightly warped. Which means i have to spend about $60 for two new rims and another $40 for new tires and some WD40. ugh, thats a over a month's work of pay.&nbsp;Oh well, hopefully things will work out well."

"event","<p>Diets, they DO hurt, both physically and mentally. I am currently on the Atkin's diet so that i can lose some weight by homecoming which is in little less than 2 weeks. oh my gosh it is so hard. this is only my second day and already i'm struggling so badly. All I am able to eat&nbsp;are meats, vegetables and some kinds of fruits, such as berries but no fruit with a large quantity of sugar. Things restricted from my diet, starches and sugars. I am not allowed to have more that 20 grams of carbs eachday and i have to eat every 4 waking hours, ever four hours that i am awake basically. I'm not sure i'll be able to keep this up for the next week and a half or so. But i want to fit in my dress again so yeah.<br /><br />Not only am i on a diet, but i do dance and breakdance everyday or so, and every night i do push ups, situps, some kind of leg lifts, and squats. I'm trying so much to lose at least SOME weight because, as i had mentioned earlier, i am actually wearing a DRESS to homecoming, it was a bribe. I told my friends that if they went to homecoming i would wear a dress. Now, about half my friends are coming, just to see me in a dress. Maybe i should have thought about maybe comign up with a different deal. Oh well, lost this one thats for sure. Can't fix whats already been broken right? For those of you who want a picture, feel free to comment. I will be buying homecoming pictures this year so i will be happy to give you one. Depending on how soon you want it and where you live, comment me or email me at <a href=""mailto:shiva124@gmail.com"">shiva124@gmail.com</a> and tell me your address or if you want me to give it to you in Santa Cruz or wherever.&nbsp;<br /><br />Love you all and i hope i managed to survive through all this.</p>"

"event","Today on the way home a couple of kids i knew were fighting a boy. When they got around the corner they said that they would all&nbsp;jump him as soon as he got around the corner on the bike. Once the kid got next to them all three started to move in to fight him a freakin 3-1 FIGHT! I LOST it soooo badly.&nbsp; 

I started to yell at all three of them fully enraged. I told the three boys to back the heck&nbsp;up from&nbsp;him and yelled&nbsp;at the boy and told him to get on his bike and leave. When the&nbsp;three boys tried to&nbsp;hit him again&nbsp;I kicked on of them and almost&nbsp;punched the other two in the jaw and one of them was only about 8-10 years old, the other two boys&nbsp;are friends of my sisters and are abou 13-14 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

But i didn't say heck or anything even slightly nice. I used profanity to the extreme. I used it like it should never be used. I can't even give the slightest detail at how angry i was. Just imagine the worst situation where someone was truly angry at you and times that by&nbsp;5 or 10. Thats how angry i was. 

When the boy left i, still fully&nbsp;enraged, told them that if they ever try to jump a kid in front of me again, and they TOLD me that they were going to, i wasn't butting my nose in some one elses business, &nbsp;i would&nbsp;beat all three of them up and not give a&nbsp;dang what happened.&nbsp;I not only scared myself with how angry i had gotten, since i haven't gotten that angry in YEARS, but i also scared my friend Zach, who has never seen me so angry. I quite honestly think that no one i have known in that last 3 years has ever seen me so angry. I felt kind of ashamed at how enraged i had gotten but i cannot and will not stand for injustice or unfairness, ESPECIALLY when you are going to fight some one. I wouldn't have cared if it was a one on one fight because then it would have been slightly fair, but jumping someone is NOT cool.&nbsp; 

When i got home and told my sister, she was truly angry at me since i had hit one of her friends, which she had every right to be. She didn't realize the reason behind it though, just that i hit her friend. Gah, i'm still a little angry from the whole encounter but i've managed to get a hold of my temper."

I gave tips to this boy i was running with so that we'll have some competition when we run later in the season. Not to mention i just felt like helping because it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy haha.

My friend got hit by a car yesterday and when he told me i was really scared. Apparently his friend, who got hit in the accident as well, has a small fracture. Rony seems ok, the friend of mine who got it, but he is a little sick at this point and time. He also got me sick...

I am struggling to keep up with school, cross-country, Performance Arts club, and Breakdance club but so far, i seem to be passing all of my classes which is good. Yet in all of this, i really haven't been able to be with or talk to many of my friends which is a little depressing. Life can be really cruel sometimes but we keep going whether or not we want to."

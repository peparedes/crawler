We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know
if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either
against us or for us. There is no middle ground here.

COLIN POWELL
Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of
the chicken crossing the road.

HANS BLIX
We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been
allowed to have access to the other side of the road.

JOHN KERRY
Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road I am now against it!

RALPH NADER
The chicken's habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted by
unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat
on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a 
gas-guzzling SUV.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal the job of a decent, hard-working American.

RUSH LIMBAUGH
I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was getting a
government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet that somebody out there is
already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road
syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans
take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars. And when I
say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took
from you to build a road for chickens to cross.

MARTHA STEWART
No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a
standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price 
dropped
to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay --- isn't it obvious? Can't you people see the
plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the 'other
side'. That's what they call it the other side. Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay. And if you eat that! chicken, you will become gay too. I 
say
we Boycott (notice I didn't say Girlcott) all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like ""the other side.""

DR SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?
Did he cross it with a toad?
Yes, the chicken crossed the road,
But why it crossed I've not been told.

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die in the rain. Alone.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without
having their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us
the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.

BARBARA WALTERS
Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the
chicken tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it
experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its life
long dream of crossing the road!

JOHN LENNON
Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together - in peace.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was an historic inevitability.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has ever gone before.

SIGMUND FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just witnessed eChicken2004 , which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook,
and internet explorer is an integral part of eChicken.

ALBERT EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What is your definition of
chicken?

AL GORE
I invented the chicken!

THE BIBLE
And God came down from heaven, and he said unto the chicken THOU SHALT 
CROSS
THE ROAD. And the chicken didst cross the road, and there was much
rejoicing.

So yeah, I was really pissy at my mom for no reason.

Now I feel kind of bad.

But I'm still in a pissy mood.  No idea why.  ::blink::

Perhaps I'm PMSing.  Although that generally makes me burst into tears, not act snarky.

After writing this, I am all depressed.  Damnit."

Keith is insane.  He wanted to uke for everything, and I think he <i>did</i> uke for all the randori.  By halfway through the demonstrations he was out of breath and he just kept going.  ::bemused smile::  It was kind of cute, though.

I LOVE SENSEI JEANETTE.  It's like in those corny coming-of-age stories where the person who is coming of age has this awesome mentor and shit.  That made no sense.

I had really scary dreams last night.  o.0

Highlights (lowlights, really):
-Flying to Jupiter on a broomstick to rescue Harry Potter characters
-Trying to help a city but instead being almost killed because they don't like me... it was scary
-Being told (by Dad, of all people) that I would be shot on sight if anyone saw my clothes
-All these random people finding this LJ and flaming me and making me a personal enemy for no real reason"

Separate my side

I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down

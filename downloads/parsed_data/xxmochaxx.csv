"event","hey everybody!!!
 i decided to update for two reasons: 1- i finally have something worth writing about and 2- people keep telling me too...so here it is...

lets see...last monday my parents went to get me a car!! i had already picked out the car i wanted ( a blue corolla), but i still wasnt sure if i was gonna get it, so my parents came home with a car monday but it was white, lets just say i was a little disappointed...so i was trying to get used to the white car, even though it wasnt even the one i wanted...so anyway, i came home tuesday from babysitting and my brand-spankin new blue car was in the driveway..i was so excited!! i was not expecting it at all..

and then on thursday me and my parents left for tennessee, we picked my brother up from RDU b/c he came in for a wedding in tenn., we got there thursday and i hung out w/ faith ( the groom's sister), and then sat. was the wedding, which was very pretty...and my brother was supposed to fly out sunday but he was too sick to, so he ended up coming home w/ us and my mom took him to the ER and found out he had bronchitis(?) and then monday we had supper w/ my grandma and uncle for the 4th and went and saw fireworks...and then today we took my bro to RDU...anyway i think my brother got my parents sick so i am staying away from them...

i also got to talk to my bestest friend tonite who i havent seen in such a long time!

alright, i'm going to bed b/c i have to get up early...
nite yall"

"event","hello...this is jessica lyn's first (FINALLY) journal entry-(by Sarah Grace)

Jessica Lyn is super cool and so is her ghetto town of aulander. There are drunk people that walk around on the street-and then to top that-there are cops that follow them in their cop cars ON THE SIDEWALK-and they STILL are too drunk to notice. Also there are rednecks and other ghetto people that honk the horn at you even if you dont know them. Aulander is the coolest. Especially when you go play tennis-(even if u talk more than actually playing). So this is my official Vacation Ad for Aulander-if you are looking for a super cool ghetto place to stay you better get ur butts over here....

SAT sux by the way. It is where Jessica and I both discovered our mental illness of ADD. It is really sucky...especially when theres weird people all around you.................but anyway make sure u read Jessica Lyn's journals because she is a dork so it is bound to make u feel good about urself when you read about her dorky life...

LUV YOU JESSICA"

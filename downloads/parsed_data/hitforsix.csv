And you stutter ecstatic
Eyes flutter like an addict

Don't shiver from cold out

"event","sometimes I think one of the hardest things in life is to just accept things for what they are. acceptance really is a hard thing when you look at it applied to things in your life. unrequited love, losing something that was important, coming to terms with mistakes. if we could all just accept things when the time is appropriate things would be a lot easier. but then, did noah accept it when allie said no in the notebook? hell no. he went and climbed the freaking ferris wheel and got his damn date. so, i guess acceptance is important when it is, and going balls out is important when it is. so there."

<P>Today was a great day. After school I went to the mall to buy chocolates from See's Candies, and glasses, and new pants from Guess? The salesguy who helped me out looked&nbsp; like Collin Farrel. Take a slightly younger Collin. Same brows, nose, mouth, eyes, eyes, eyes. Guessorize him with crazy metro style. And ad congeniality. And you have the imaginary Collin Farrel brother. Except for this was a real person.</P>

<P>When I got back eventually I had a cool little art session with Kristine, Kelly, and Mia (age 3), all under the age of 10. We took some of my extra little box containers and painted them wickedlycolourfulcool. I get such a blast out of teaching kids art. Hmmm.... <EM>maybe</EM> I should be an art docent....what a crazy idea that would be...So yeah, it was cool. I also started them with bead necklaces, but after the boxes it was time to eat! Lubia Polo! My <STRONG><EM>favorite</EM></STRONG> food!!!! It's an Iranian dish that I just <EM>devour</EM>. Anyways, then I watched my little cousin Elijah (about 1 1/2 years) by the pool. Somehow it became 9ish and we were all outside and I was teaching Kristine and Kelly how to kick the ball properly. I kicked off my flip-flops, so my feet got totally blackened by the pavement. Me and Bij rode around the street in my old bike and his scooter. Speaking of bikes, the song Bicycle by Pink Floyd was mentioned in a convo about Pink Floyd b/w me, Eric, and Lisa today. Oh, the sprinkers had also gone off earlier on our boxes since we laid them out in the grass! But miraculously, they stayed okay for the most part!</P>
<P>So we went inside after being outside ((what&nbsp;goes up must come down!)) and we signed our boxes, and I washed my feet, and set up the game <U>Operation</U> for them, and got ready for bed. And am talking to Chelsea, and planning on&nbsp;getting up early tomorrow.</P>
<P>Look at Howlin Pele up there. How&nbsp;good-looking is he? </P>
<P>While I'm in class, I am so jittery. because I need to go outside and run. Pent up energy is like staring at a glass of water when you're thirsty, and not being able to drink it.</P>

"event","As the novel progresses, we begin to perceive that Holden's alienation is his way of protecting himself. Just as he wears his hunting hat to advertise his uniqueness, he uses his isolation as proof that he is better than everyone else around him and therefore above interacting with them. The truth is that interactions with other people usually confuse and overwhelm him, and his cynical sense of superiority serves as a type of self-prtoection. Thus, Holden's alienation is the source of what little stability he has in his life.

He never addresses his own emotions directly...He desperately needs human contact and love, but his protective wall of bitterness prevents him from looking for such interaction. Alienation is both the source of Holden's strength and the source of his problems.

Yeah. Following the lovley trailer inevitably was Secret Window. And I had to go to the bathroom, like, the whole time. Oh well. That's all. Kiss my ass."

"event","Okay. Today I was scammed at Target. I'm out and about Roseville buying Renuka her lovely birthday present bag, tissue, and card...the store is going to close in about five minutes and I want to go home. So I bring my basket to the checkout. Now, I'm a firm believer that attidude really can make an impact on things. Even such things as little over the checkout conversations. So automatically the guy asks me how I am. Okay. Only okay? Yeah I'm good. Things he does too much: cares and smiles slyly: at the same time. Aack I think to myself. I want to get out of here. This is a rubbernecking type of guy (lol, Chelsea)So I'm like yeah, okay get on with it...12 something is the total I hand him a twenty b/c i'm too lazy to charge and I don't want him to know my name b/c of his smilingasshole weird aura---of course i'm the analytical crazy one, but still, it's a subconscious way of thinking that I have i guess...so yeah, he counts out the change (mocking me I'm sure of after the discovery i made!)into my hand and I grab the bag, and put the money in my wallet as I walk out with my mom. The bag sits by my white high tops on our way home. We get home, I look into the bag for the card and the receipt. they are no where to be found. I run out to the car again. They aren't on the ground. I go back, empty the bag and search aimlessly for the receipt and card. The guy charged me for everything. But the card wasn't there, and the receipt was missing as well. I called 411 to get that sleazy target's number. But they were closed dammit. So yeah, I'm calling their asses tomorrow. And I'm gonna raise hell! Because this is a card and a reciept we're talkin about! I've been scammed. the worst part is, is all the foreshadowing. The overcharging at Fresh Choice, the forgetting to check the reciept before signing it in Copelands....all leading up to this hard learned lesson.


i can't believe I wrote that much about target.

luv yas."

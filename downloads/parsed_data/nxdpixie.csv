"event","i dont feel like talking to anyone right now.  tonight sucked.  it was supposed to make me happy.

i would really love it if things worked out tomorrow night so i could go and party wtih brandon.  i think that would make me happy.  well, i would hope so.

i dont even feel like seeing deftones.  my shows have let me down.  i dont really like concerts by national bands.  im growing to hate them, cause they always get fucked up.  and there's retarded people there.  and its mad crowded.  i prefer local shows anyday.

this post was pointless"

"event","today was so very enjoyable.  

we had the ""trainer olympics"" for work.  had to wake up at 5:30 and of course I was sick all night and got 0 hours of sleep.  everyone met at white marsh, then we all got in a coach bus and drove to New Jersey for 3 hours.  all day was mostly just stupid events to get points.  we didnt win anything lol.  our store didnt even give a shit.  we all just went to get drunk on the bus ride home.  

on the way back we stopped and got the alcohol and all the fun started.  they were all makin fun of me cause i was non-stop talking.  insane.  when we got back to white marsh, a couple of us just walked around and ate because we were too drunk to go home right away.  and the best part, <b>i found someone else with crohns</b>.  I was sayin how it didnt matter what kind of pizza we got because i wasnt gonna eat much, and i had to scrape the top of it off anyway, and of course they ask why and i say crohns.  then Brian sticks his hand out and shakes mine and says he has it too.  that made my night.  plus we had one of the most interesting and stimulating intellegent conversations ive had in a long long time.  it was great.

so even though i still cant eat anything more than a piece of bread and im getting sicker by the day, i still have hope because Brian has it too.  ive finally found someone to confide in, he is the most genuine person ive ever met.  and probably will ever meet.  he said he used to be on Pred and he gained 30 lbs on it.  thank god i havent had to resort to that yet.  but now he seems to have it under control, and he said he just minimized all the stress in his life.  which is what im trying to accomplish now.  via alternative medicine and things such as yoga.  

i could go on and on about Brian.  he just intrigues me.  hes 23, and he is just sooo damn proper.  he does everything by the book.  very meticulous.  and hes the biggest sweetheart.  he'll do anything you ask of him, with no complaints.  we were joking about it on the way down this morning.  we said if someone told him he had cancer, his reply would be, ""well thank you for giving me that information.""  lol i guess you just have to know him.  he speaks so intelligently.  and hes not a huge dork, and hes not ugly.  i dont know how to explain.

anyway, i have gotten no sleep today and im kinda still in a stupor from drinking sooo i think im gonna go to sleep now.  yeah, sleep."

"event","what the hell did i do last night.  fuck me up the ass.  cause i did not like that at all.  how the hell is that supposed to be all good and fun?  it was horrible!  why would you ever do that more than once?  wow, never again.  what was i thinking.

I have to work today and i dont wanna.  i still feel disoriented.  i wanna go get my digital camera this weekend but i have to work all the time.  i'll ask my dad to go with me in the morning before work i guess.  

im tired of summer.  i want it to be fall already.  and i want it to be my birthday.  i just dont wanna be in school.  and you know what?  i really like poems.  a lot.  i just hate writing 8 page papers about them.  i really like this one . . .

indeed, the source of the problem is
there's never anything to say
no point in wasting air on a shrug
and a wish
and a how have you been
when really, neither of us care
enough and
it hurts too much to sigh an even bigger whole into my heart
i'm aching for freedom like
a goldfish in a bowl looking out
into the ocean
i'm strictly a bathtub mermaid
and i want
ohsomuch
to feel the salt on my skin
but enough about my plastic sunken treasure,
i'd ask how you've been
but i can't hear you from behind the glass
i'll just wave from the bathtub
and try not to feel
so stranded 

i wanna write a cool poem like that.  maybe i will."

"event","alrighty then, i could not have been more wrong about tonight.  i had so much fun.  we didn't even end up gong where we were supposed to, because someone was being gay about it.  but there were a few good perks to staying right where we were.  first of all, no awkward drama, and second, Kevin showed up!! he was the last person i would have expected to come.  but he obviously did, and it was a nice surprise. i didn't talk to him much, but still.  i am finally being able to show my crazy self more, and i love it. i just have to learn to do it all the time now.  woohoooo!!"

"event","i didn't wake up today until like 2:30 . . . and now i feel really lazy cause i don't want to do anything.  i was supposed to get a bunch of stuff done since it's my day off, oh well. I don't remember what I was thinking yesterday so i'll just start a new one.

Chili's opens tomorrow, and I have to work the dinner shift.  It is going to be so fucking busy.  Why couldn't I work lunch?  Well, i am hoping they call me to work lunch because there are only two people working it so far.  I really dont care right now though, because I have off on friday and I get to ride with the band to their show!!  I am so beyond excited, I feel all kinds of special right now, I can't wait till friday!  I felt really special last night too, maybe its a new trend for me hehe.  I was chattin with Ceci, and she told me something that made me feel like a million bucks.  It might require a bunch of explaining to understand so i'll just leave it at that.  But Ceci, thank you for telling me because you have no idea how good it made me feel to know that!!

Hmmmm, what has been going on, i dunno not much really.  I have been so busy with training for work lately that it doesn't leave much time for anything else.  Then like today when I have a day off, I sleep the whole day away.  I'm getting the urge to make some more stuff though, and I need some time to go get fabric and make some more clothes.  Maybe I'll make some shirts for work since the dress code changed.  I can't stand to look like everyone else, I'm gonna have to bust out my creativeness. 

My writing skills are lacking today.  Usually I can just go on and on once I get started writing about stuff . . . but right now I guess I have nothing cool to write about or something, i dunno.  I'll just have to post about how crazy work is tomorrow for the opening day."

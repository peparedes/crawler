Gotta flag some yakuza members down for what to do with Kaemon, and see whats up in my okiya so I can get Kodachi back involved. Is there a set time for the chat room RPs now? Will they always be at 7?

Can't wait to RP with you guys again!"

"event","Kodachi approached the Okiya very cautiously. She knew she wasn't supposed to be out and wasn't in the mood to be caught yet. Quietly, she creaked open the door and peeked in. Hearing no sounds inside, she pushed the door open further and removed her sandals, leaving them by the entrance as she crept further into the okiya, quickly moving as quietly as possible until she was in the safety of her room.

Once inside, she closed the door behind her and allowed a sigh of relief to escape her. Moving towards her journal, she sat down and picked it up, dipping a brush before she started to write. Writing was practice for her, as upon entrance to the okiya she didn't know how to read. Keeping a journal was the best way to practice for her.

What an interesting day I had! I got to meet a geisha today, as well as a fellow maiko! (Well, I cannot call myself maiko yet, but it is fun to pretend!) They both told me of how difficult it was to be geisha, but that it definately pays off! I certainly cannot wait to become an apprentice now!</i>"

"event","<i>I am really excited! It has been several months since my birthday has passed, and now that I am of age I will soon become maiko! It seems like forever since I first came to the okiya, when I was no older than ten years of age. Now I am fifteen, and I hope that I can bring my father's name honor.

Several lifetimes must have passed since I left them and the rice farm, as it seems so long ago. I wonder about how they are doing sometimes, but that does not help the fact that my mind wanders a lot to begin with. My mind is a bird that refuses to stay caged, and I need to fix that for when I start training!

I started my classes before my birthday, and am mainly focused on basic entertainment like dancing and drumming, and will start tea ceremony soon, once I officially become an apprentice. I have a lot of classes I know I have to eventually take, like Koto, Shamisen, Ikebana, Erfu lessons... So much is to be expected of me! I am really nervous but excited, too.

I wonder if anyone would want to be my oneesan.. I know I am not as boyish as I once was, but I still fail to see the beauty in me that I see in the other maiko.. Am I good enough for an older sister?</i>"

"event","<p align=""center""><font color=""#800000"" size=""4""><strong>Life is not suppose to be easy obviously. It gets harder everyday. I'm not complaining I just wish I could find the easy answers. Everyday I wake up at 630am get ready for class, then get my son up by 715am. Tryin to get him dressed in the morning is not so easy. He wakes up mad at me every morning and whines the whole time I am tryin to get him dressed. I have got to have him to where ever he is going for the time I go to class by 730 so i can leave town by 740. I get to class and sit in the same classroom for 4 hours. 4&nbsp;long sleepy hours.&nbsp;I am currently taking English Comp. I that is ok. I do not like&nbsp;formal writing. It just confuses me. Then at 10 Intro to Sociology begins. My teacher is awesome! Mr. Johnson is his name and if any one plans to take sociology at BCCC he is the one u want to learn it from. I have 6 Essays and a test due every week! Class is dismissed at 1150. I leave and go pick up my child&nbsp;from his daycare&nbsp;for that day or 4 hours go home feed him lunch, bathe him and then lay him down for a nap by 1pm. Giving me 30 minutes to do the dishes and change the laundry and fold the clothes fresh outta the dryer. Change&nbsp;into my work clothes and&nbsp;wake my son and take him to the next day care by 150p. Then off to work&nbsp;I am from 2p-10p. sometimes i get off at 10 sometimes at 1015-1030. Then&nbsp;I once again retrieve my son and take him home, bathe him again, read him a bed time story get his milk and&nbsp;blanky and off to bed he is. Now its about 11 or 1130p. And&nbsp;I have at least 2 hours of homework. Leaving me not to&nbsp;bed until 1 or 2 am. then up again at 630a. What 21 year old should have to b doing this? Well&nbsp;I am&nbsp;now lead to believe that its me!! I dont get&nbsp;enough time with my son at all.&nbsp; I miss him so much. I dont get to spend&nbsp;much one on one time with him but he will&nbsp;forgive me now instead of when he is&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Time is just so short and&nbsp;I dont&nbsp;get that freedom time to myself to even think about how crzy my life is&nbsp;right now.&nbsp;I&nbsp;actually got some time right now&nbsp;b/c&nbsp;I dont have to work tmrw so&nbsp;I took a little time to gather my thoughts and work somethings through my head.&nbsp;I just remind my self that it could b worse! I love my life and being independent and making it on my own but sometimes things are sooo much and fill all my time.</strong></font></p>"

"event","<p align=""center""><em><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""4"">I start school tmrw and im a little nervous about it because im going everyday from 8-12 then working 2-10. i just wont have time for everything anymore. i will miss the days of just doing nothing and hanging out with my son. right now i am in a relationship and i dont believe that is gonna last. in a way i dont want it to. i dont wanna worry about keeping him happy. he is the last of my worries. i just wanna break it off but i dont really know how. he is very supportive of me going back to school and he understands that i wont have time for anything. he is a good person but sometimes i just need to stop thinkin bout how others are feeling an just do whats best for me. just dont want to b that mean girl. but i know he will understand and thats what makes it so hard. my mom and i have been gettin along so much better. i just needed that week for her to b gone. i like it when she is gone and i dont have to worry about her and how she is feeling all the time. i know she is happy when she gets to leave. i am happy when she leaves. but its good that we are getting along for the time being. she is not repeaditively asking me about my dad and what he is doing. i dont even know what he is doing everyday! but anyways i have got to go to bed i got my first day of school tmrw.</font></em></p>"

"event","<p>Today was a good day. Braden and i spent the whole day together. he is so funny. i couldn't get a thing done because he just wanted to give me hugs all day. how was i gonna tell my son no to a hug. we sat in the chair for at least 30 minutes just him saying hug hug and then giving me a big hug. I had the day off and the first day without my mom here. I love my mom but she seriously drives me crazy. She also makes me very angry. I have the hardest times dealing with her. She is so worried about us&nbsp;caring about how she feels. why should i care how she feels. she is the one who made me feel the way i do. im the child she is suppose to be the mother. i try and try to just get over what she did to me but i can't. she is always crying. about everything. i can't even talk about my life with out her crying at one point. she cries because she is hurting. well she hurt herself. she says that i am punishing her for what she did. no im not. i just dont know how to handle my true emotions about her. i dont have sympathy for her and i show that i dont have any. and that is how she thinks im punishing her. i wish sometimes she would just realize what she did and grow stronger now that she can finally see the hurt and pain that everyone has suffered because of her addiction. she is always thinkin that im out to get her. my intentions are not to hurt her. i know i am not nice to her. i am that way because i dont respect her. she commits to doing things for&nbsp;me then bitches the whole time she is doing them. she suggested things to do then doesn't wanna do them. i dont make her&nbsp;do anything. she offers to do&nbsp;so much for me&nbsp;and complains all the time&nbsp;about it. those are the type of things i can't stand about her!!!!! i dont know how to forgive her completely but i am giving it my best efforts. that is it for today. &nbsp;</p>"

-Thursday Dec. 9th!!!-
ReLaY CaRnIvAl was oh so thrilling besides the fact that it was at EP and it is such a bitch to get out of that damn pool.  Bruce was so bitchy at us because we supposibly ""dont work hard enough"" so basically swim practices from now on are going to be a bitch. Anywho, 'Riel came over that night and slept over because we had to head up to M.I.T the next morning to swim..
FRIDAY
..rolls around at 4:45am and head to M.I.T to swim the 200free and the 400IM..yeah thats exactly what Im in the mood to do at that hour..so yeah we swam and then Casey Renner, her mom and I checked into our hotel in Boston (: (the Hyadt)  it was reallllyy nice.  when we got to our room on the 14th floor we noticed that we didnt have a room overlooking the Charles river so casey called the lobby and changed it cause shes silly like that. so then we moved to floor 11 and got a river room which was AMAZING!! so me an casey decided to explore for an hour or so..we found that the pool and hot tub were underconstruction..poop...but we still had fun riding the see through elevators overlooking the hotel with pretty lights on them...heh..then we decided to go read magazines in the hotel's gift shop.  While we were reading Laura Ginish walked by with her suitcase and she was like ""I didnt know u guys were here!"" (She had been sleeping in the lobby by herself because she had to check out earlier that day because she had to stay in another hotel for the rest of the weekend..well...to make a long story short..she was homeless basically) hah soooo she joined us in reading and then she dared me and casey to sit on the floor of the gift shop to read..so we did...and this guy walked by and sarcastically was like ""Can I get you ladies anything? tea? coffee?"" and we were like haha nooope thanks. We also saw the hofstra wrestling team check in...yay for that...anyway!.. we went back to finals and warmed up and watched all the fast people swim..and so on...
SATURDAY-
Woke up bright and early and then Casey drove us to the meet...I swam the 50 and 500 free...funnnn...i did well though so i cant bitch...and then we went to eat lunch at *Cinderellas* a hard core italian joint..it was really good...we went back to the hotel and slept and then ... we tried to drive back to finals but the car didnt start so we had to walk...poop....  AFter finals Casey and I had soup and salad at the hotel's restaurant and sat on the couches and watched the people in the elevators because it never gets old for us..hah...we saw like half the rams team (including CHris Quin)eating dinner all dressed up...mind you casey and I were in sweats..but hey...when we finished eating casey and i rode elevators and saw some more Hofstra Wrestling boys...A college party in one of the suits...andd some more BC and M.I.T dorms..I think that they are so lucky in a way that their universities ran out of dorms on campus and they get to live in a hotel...A REALLY NICE hotel at that...but moving on..Later casey and I thought it would be funny to drop a thing of chapstick of the 14th floor balcany and see if we can get it on this big open balcany that sticked out on the third floor..but it missed and bounced off an auwning...it was funny though..very immature but funny...
SUNDAY- 
last dayyyyyyy of swimming..casey and I walked to the meet (with kelsey this time)..and i swam the 200 fly and did well..thank god.  I think we all did good this weekend!! finally!!!! hah...then after that Mr. Parry drove me back to the hotel so I could get my shit...michael helped me and then we went to McDonalds and i got one of those salads which by the way are very good....and then I got home finally.  It was nice to be home even thought the weekend was fun.  I did my history paper..went to the pasta dinner at megs...Very Fun..and then studied for history. 
TODAY!!!-School was ok..nothing really funny happend except I love B days because i have 5th period art and amanda, sarah, tom and I make it pretty fun..hah! well im off to a meet VS Lasalle! ill write more later.....

"event","well, this thanksgiving weekend was pretty good I must say.
On Friday 
I got to sleep in (: (even though im a wicked morning person and can never sleep past 7 but thats ok...) and then my mom and I went to the bank so I could make my own account.  Then I picked ashley up and we went to the mall and went shopping for what was supposed to be xmas shopping for my fam and something for michael but i have no freaking clue what to get michael soooo he hasta give me an idea...but i only ended up getting one thing for one of my sisters, earrings for ME and the ***ALL POINTS BULLITEN: DISPATCH AT THE HATCH & AT SUMMERVILLE DVD AND TWO CD's*** for 20 BUCKS! (again for me)what a buyyyyy(: so yeah that was the best part of my day.  Me and ashley walked around for a while but she kept whinning like a 5 year old ""im hungryyyyy im tiredddddddd i needa sit downnnn"" lol (i still love you ashley) we also tried on winter ball dresses at filenes which was so fun because none of them fit either of us and they ended up being REALLY ugly..we looked like mermaids..hah. We also went to the ""valley cafe"" or w.e the hell its called...and now we relize why everything was so cheap..its cause it was GROSS. I got chai becuase i remember when i tried kim's in NYC it was REALLY good(most likely becuase it was from STARBUCKS!!!)..but this places chai blew. and i was mad.  and ashley got this cookie thing and it blew also.  That was sad.  but theeeeen we went outside to look for my mom and she was 10 min late and me and ashley thought she got hit by a drunk driver (think back to the health movie) it was really sad but she was laughing at me for thinking that that was what happend to my mom..but you never know.  SO then we dropped ash off and i went to CHS swim which was fun. and theeeeeeen i went home and my sister (christine) and scot were home so we ate leftovers from thanksgiving and watched elf.
Saturday- Woke up bright and early for swim practice at attl.  Funnnn!  then i came home and basically slept for the entire day..not even joking.  So then at night I went over andrew's and met the whooooole otto fam..like their aunts and uncles and cousins... (: it was fun and they were all really nice!  We watched the dispatch dvd with diana and his cousin, Meredith who was wicked cool.and she graduated from UNH last may.. and she taught me how to look people up from UNH...is that clicking with anyone?  UNH..stalker...yeah i think you get it. haha anywayysss it was a fun.
Today, sunday- i woke up for practice..practice was really good.  We swam 9,100 yards today(5.5 miles)! I came home feeling accomplished, but very very sore and tired.  Carl and Paul(our coaches) were really funny today..they were in a really good mood for some reason (""and this episode of seasame street was brought to you by the number 3! READY...GOOO!"") (: then came home and started my english paper and other such productive things* I dislike sundays..because I know monday is coming...school..yuck. FIRST DAY OF CHS PRACTICE TOMORROW YAYYYAYAYAYAY..then im going to ahs practice (only 1.2 though) well...im gunna get going..later

"event","-what a daaaaaaaaay-
First me and ash went to the game and at first the weather really wasnt all that bad.  10 minutes into the game...downpour.  Did ashley and i have an umbrella? nope.  Did my dad insist i bring one and once again I said ""nah I'll be fine""? yup. Dont you hate that?! they are always right with shit like that. anywho...I got to see melanie and kate otto today (: amen to that! Call me dorky but, They honestly are two of the greatest role models ive ever had.  hah, anways then when i got home i noticed that my aero pink skirt still had that security thingy on it and i cant figure out how i got out of the store without the alarm going off.  wonderful security we have here at emerald mall eh?! yep, so my dad took it off w.o ruining it so that was nice.  Then the fam came over and yadda yadda yadda next thing i know i never wanna look at another food item agaiN! but thats the joy of turkey day. Well i hope everyone had a greatday! ill write more later.
Peace<3"

"event","today was Lovely* minus the fact that the school day went by sooooo slow it was ridiculous.  especially because i had hoyle last and all we did was stare at the clock.  Lots of the seniors came back to visit today minus Melanie and Kate otto ): cool eh? I hope too see them sooooon!  I am so happy that we have 4 days off (:  Thanksgiving tomorrow!!! yay...and im not going to swim tonight..i feel bad about it but..hey whats one practice?  This afternoon ashley and I went to play soccer in the rain at filipe's house with jeff.  Then Jeff taught us how to drive his (standard) car. haha..I was too scared to drive it though cause I havent even driven a auto. car yet...but he actually trusted ashley to drive it..(Not a pretty site) haha...well im off for now.  Later

I got a profuse nosebleed today. Although it looked totally harcore and awesome, it was probably the result of picking my nose. cold weather=frozen boogers."

The other night i was sitting on the front porch at 3 a.m. It was one of those biting cold nights, the kind that numb your hands within seconds and you wonder why it's not snowing. All of the sudden, the black air seemed to wash out into white and i believe that's what they refer to as an epiphany. I went crazy trying to reglue the past back into one cohesive peice. I went crazy trying to retrace my lost friends that seemed to all have dissapeared into the very thin air, thick with the smell of tragedy, as if they next morniing, their sad pixelated faces would appear on the backside of a milk carton, or on those coupons that i always avert my eyes at, you know the one's: they're blue and say in inapropriately whimsicle letters, 'HAVE YOU SEEN ME???'

I went crazy trying to reach Nia from Marymount in New York. Last I'd heard, she really had dissapeared. This anchor of guilt nestled itself in my stomach. Tried her old cell. not a working number. tried email. deleted. myspace. deleted. lj. deleted. 2 different home numbers. not&nbsp; working numbers in California. What the fuck?? did she die or something? I really should've helped guide her long distance through this past year, but *sigh* i did'nt. I'm obsessed with tracking her down because my life is devoid of all mystery and i realized, i've built a complete house of isolation round myself all this time i've been home. foundation and all. and all of the people that formerly loved me, that i loved so terribley, are no longer working numbers. Same with you Matt Newton! I knew you read these!"

"event","I just spent 4 hours making a scrap book -or atleast a white binder with sheet protectors- it felt like some kind of cemetary for a years worth of fading loveletters, a few rare photographs and other sentimental peices that most might have considered trash long ago. It was an accident really. I was cleaning and stumbled upon this box that I'd hidden from myself more than a year ago, at the time even leafing through these items made me ill, but today, I just really had to and I'm glad. But reading it in completion is like a time warp and sadly, I'm much too old to be doing that shit anymore. sigh.

My cousin, who is an officer in the marine corp, shipped off to Iraq yesterday. He just turned 23 and our family had this party for him and it was extremely odd, he had this look in his eye that seemed to be a mixture of distance and acceptance but he's so stoic. A year ago we were talking in private and he admitted to me that he'd recently realized he wanted to be a film actor and not a veteran like his father. He kind of followed my uncle and my brother into it but he's always been too much of a hardass to tell anyone else what he told me. I hate this war. I dont know what it's for and I truly wonder if anyone else could really tell me.

My boyfriend is moving to Italy in 6 days. Due to him, I've had a strange summer full of unpredictable admissions, harmless perscription drug use and midnight races to the ER. He's the only person who's blood I've ever been able to look at in large quantities without fainting- Em and I saved his life one night, if we had'nt sped over to his house after a strange phone call he would have bled to death, it was an overwhelming sight- I had to hold his wound together in the backseat and now I've got an outfit stained red forever. Contrary to popular belief, it was a freakish drunken accident. Letting go of him will be interesting, but I've already let go a bit. He's doing the same, but o god I'm so greatful to have met him the way I did. He turned on something that I had long before pronounced dead, I'm so fucking relieved for that.
My hair is short
I'm sticking around for a year
grisly application process all over again
but this time, for something I believe in.
If anyone needs me, I'll be around. Ha."

He snaps it open- puts it on speaker phone and I hear the distortion of Emily's voice and the noise of live music in the background.
""Hey!"" she says, followed by inaudible exclamations.
'Where are you?' I am shouting at an open cell phone that he's holding before me. Just then he snaps it shut with a pop. I'm taken aback-
'why did you do that?'
He tilts his head thoughtfully from the other side of the couch, goofy smile across his face, something manic flickering on and off in his eyes like flashing bulbs. 
""Hmmm..."" he scartchess his head in mock concentration.
""Because I dont want to talk to her"" (pauses, then hooks me dead on in the eyes).
His tone of voice changes from light to extremely grave when he says:

""Or you"".
I flinched. 'what?'
he studies me a moment, the wide eyes, the panic constricted vocal chords, the shock that hardened my expression and turned my body rigid.
""I dont like her.."" (afterthought) ""And I dont like you either"".
I cock my head like a bird.
""You're really shy"". It's an insult.
""And you're fake""
""And boring, and I really dont like hanging out with you"".
(At this point I know I'm not breathing but my lungs just seemed to quit on me. So my eyes widen to saucers, waiting for him to say 'i'm just fucking with you!'....but he doesnt.)Instead he mimicks my large doe-eyed expression and nods over-emphatically.
""Yeah-I'm not kidding. I dont want you here anymore. Get out of my house now"".
He waves by clasping his fingers against his plam. down and up.
""Goodbye"".
He gets up and walk to the restroom
I sit, stone faced in that moronic gaping mouthed comotose and try with every fiber in my body, to remember how to breath. Instead, I get my purse and walk out, muttering something about forgetting to lock the car to his stunned best friend. Down the courtyard, out the front gate and to my car that's parked all the way across the lot. I hide in the dark, cant find a fucking lighter and the only thing in the world that makes an ounce of sense after the previous encounter, is a goddamn cigarette.
Out of nowhere, he appears.
he'd followed me out, had this look of horror on his face b/c he'd realized what he'd just said to his girlfriend. he could'nt have been more sorry, but then, he'd say something worse and I listened, dissapointed to find that he had a hidden mean streak. I almost punched him in the face, but thought twice, because I'm absolutely sure that he'd have hit me back harder, and then beat the living shit out of me. and then, apologize profusely, or not.

my stinging pride, my nights that never end in sleep= that's what I've got left over."

"event","A week or so ago I discovered that admission of the truth (for me) and facing fears falls nothing short of a full blown exorcism. Chairs flew violently, eyes were wild with rage and the self-anhilist in me went kicking and screaming into the night in one last attempt to cover that heinous thing inside that had grown to magnanimous proportions; a product of the last 10 months, a genre of frightening mal-adjustment, self-inflicted (but inevitable, mind you,)degradation and that horrible method of survival that I now identify as self-loathing. There it is, in the overzealous flesh. Everytime I felt it tickling my throat, threatening to come out through my mouth, I'd bite my tongue til it bled, that's how ashamed I've been. Yeah= I sucked for a long time. New York had it's effect and I must give it due credit, no matter how overdramatic it reads. My big question is: would this have happened anywhere? Well I'm not going back, but I found I'd brought all of it home and could'nt bear to say the words until that night a week or so ago, that took the form of an exorcism. Emily played the priest for me.

I spoke the thing I had done and now I can feel the memory, the flashbacks, the ugly things that no one knows about dissipating slowly. Liberation, like many things, is bitter-sweet.

I'm writing a short story and I think I've finally found a jewel that'll turn into the play I've been writing for a year and some. I haven't slept at home in 3 weeks+, I quit my job and got another, I drove someone to the ER early sunday morning and watched them get a big shot in the heiney. I ate blueberries off the bush at Emily's farm for her birthday, I discovered the joy of four-wheelers, I've been acting as a straight jacket in the night to someone who's constantly plauged with nightmares, holding someone when they're screaming in their sleep is an experience I wont be soon forgetting. Life is transitional and I am fine."

Hey do you remember why you wanted a livejournal in the first place? No really, take a nostalgic moment and attempt to recall that very day. Here's mine: a few days prior to my tail-end-of-september-birthday, senior year of high school, I thought hey: it feels so goddamn good to write I might as well do it and have others acknowledge it (or atleast humor myself with that possibility). That was in the olden times when you had to plead for a code from an already-established lj user. So I wrote, and did not yet believe in censorship or self-conciousness for what I was feeling, much less who I was. Ahh yes and others did read.

i wake up gasping for air, there's this internal ticking that gives way to an alarm and it always goes off at the same time everyday, usually around 10:30-11 am, and i cant silence it. I know there's a reason for what i've been doing, i guess i'm testing the humanity in myself, weighing it constantly to see 'if i do this, how much good is left in me?'. oh no, it's not a recreational thing, like a hobby or a pastime. It's more like 'when i hit rock bottom, all i'll see is up and everything in between. I say this knowing I'm okay and that I'm growing moreso everyday and it's inevitable that we'll all be okay. Evenso I have to validate your pain, and so: holyshit it hurts so bad to watch."

"event","Today I went over to emily's apartment with claire and abby and because em has just experienced the scathing side of love and heartbreak, we had a midday substance abuse session with 2 bottles of wine and some muscle relaxers. Abby and em played songs they's written about us on the guitar (abby played and they both sang) and then claire showed us a slide show she's made about us each while away at college in montana. And then came the crying and claire and I formed a human chain around her while she talked. Emily said: ""before I could'nt ever relate to all those times you were torn apart b/c of mikey, but now I completely understand and it's agony"". Yeah well, here's the thing- I could'nt at all relate to her feelings today. It was eerie, everything she was expressing I know that I've said those exact words, felt beaten and it was excruciating but I feel like some kind of shell now. I cant relate to matters of the heart right now, all I have is apathy. Not for her- just for myself- it's so strange. Mikey and I seemed to snap like a twig subjected to too much weight, I pushed him away and in turn everything he said sounded cold and reminesecnt of another time in which his feelings were so transient and unsupported. I guess I dont have it in me to test out the theory that we belong together. Not right now. He's a very good man and I love him with all of my heart, however, I cannot make those assertions regarding my own character and accountability at this time so, alone it is.

In What the Bleep they said love is an addiction to the anticipation of feeling that results from the release of chemicals in our brain. Love lasts only as long as the other person is compliant in giving enough fuel to further that anticipation. That scares me, but it may just be true. I just watched the notebook, it made me feel like 'fuck, i wish i had some feelings in this icy rock of a heart I've got'. last night I watched Team America with blake minor. He owns many hats. Oh yeah, and today I got a visitor who was two fucking weeks later and every few seconds I remind myself that I wont be spawning any illegitimate lovechildren. Too much? I think not.

Goodbye goodnight."

Was very un-invited to the family barbeque of my significant other. He said:'that's my family' and how does one respond to that? oh well, is that normal? I mean, they've known me for about 4 years now, I practically lived at their house for ages. I'm not sure what's going on here.

Em and Abby are in Tennessee for Bonaroo. How I wish I could be there. I feel so sedated, and woke up sweating (what a fucking surprise) because of what felt like hours of nightmares about nyc. My mom and I were wandering through these haunted hallways of what was supposed to be nyu and right when we'd escaped, i'd realize that I'd left something important like my purse, and we'd have to seperate so I could go get it but I'd start freaking out once I'd entered some dark room which was'nt the one I'd previously been in and then I'd see dead bodies and shit like that. *shudder*

It's not yet full heat, the world is green and hot and I am pink in it. I am so happy to be home, the dreams have dulled to less malevolent heights and I wake up sweating less and less. For 2 weeks straight I dreamt of serial killers and the ground opening up like a sordid chute of terror and me, dying every time. Then, I dreamt of him: every-single-fucking-night. He'd appear infront of me, eyes dark as always, skin too pale to be human, smooth like stones, smelling like skin and my past.
A kiss on the forehead that followed the biting remark that said 'we never happened'
I'd look up in awe and say nothing
I knew it was'nt real but said: 'why does it feel like you're really here?'
Go away. Get out of my dreams. They're my dreams but I could've sworn that some part of you mixed in with the incoherence of subconcious nonsense. Goodbye Goodnight.

I am someone's girlfriend. Are you who you'd always hoped to be? Is anyone? Or is everyone but me? Questions all of the time. I am happy but not standing on any sort of labeled ground, I dont know where I stand and there is a great part of me that is severely unhappy, I wish I knew which part that was. I'm a little tired of telling others their lives and having no one who is fully able to do the same. Yes, I may know almost everything about anyone who stands too close to me. That's my burden and maybe a great blessing.
A kid I used to be friends with told me to fuck off at Kristine's birthday. I was drunk and stunned and left quietly and cried later and hated crying. I work at the black lab and they dress us like school girls. Come check it out. I serve minors. Blake Minors, that is.

"event","want to hear an ironic poem? ofcourse you do.

(may 2004)

Sometimes I catch myself
What am I to do, if I fall in love with you?
Funny how tables turn
How flowers rise and bloom from heaps of
unfertile city streets
I used to watch you sink beneath the weight of 
my unmade mind
Beneath my harping tune of 'i cant decide'
Through a collection of tortured compilations
Songs were symbols, a number on a cd
A track that said ""I love you""
Number 3.

a year ago I wrote these sorts of things in my planner during class or before school in the mornings where I spent 45 minutes of solitude at diedrichs everyday for nearly four years. Cigarettes and coffee and reflection- predicting how it would all end up and being so right on that it's uncanny. Funny how my behavior never suggested this dignity, quiet dignity that keeps my head held up everyday. Maybe the only thing that does.
Why did'nt I just give it to him?
What was I so afraid of in saying: i love you too

"event","The other day I was sitting outside of the Starbucks on 1st Avenue smoking a cigarette when I was approached by a smiling homeless guy with jacked up teeth wearing olds school headphones attached to a broken walkman probably from 1987. He asked me for a cigarette and after giving him one, he then said:
""Girl- you's got the most beautiful green eyes I've ever seen! Damn them eyes is green!""

I laughed and then thought to myself that this was the first time someone has remarked on the color of my eyes without me having to tell them they were'nt blue. My eyes are actually pretty colorless- they're kind of a washed out gray-green. My mom thought they were blue til I was nearly 17, I remember the moment I enlightened her junior year.
I then said, ""can I ask you a question?""- he said yes a little surprised and I asked, ""have you ever been in a war?"" and his face became strange and solemn and he mentioned being a marine in the Korean war in a barely audible tone. He then talked about his father being a marine and going to Vietnam (he did'nt say whether or not he returned)and then he began talking with great enthusiasm about his childhood, traveling around the world with his family, playing sports and being in boyscouts, which he then described for 5 minutes, as the best thing ever. He talked about climbing a mountain and being in the clouds and looking down. He asked me if I'd ever been on top of a mountain, I told him yes and that it was beautiful. He walked away smiling and said ""I'll see you in the movies girl!"". It was the nicest experience I've had in months.
I've developed this great fascination with Vietnam veterans, well war veterans in general really. I've found that if you ask a homeless man,who's appraoched you in the street, if he's ever been in a war, chances are he'll say yes, but change the subject immediatley. I dunno, I find it important. I've been working on a research paper about the pyschological effects of war and Post-trauamtic stress disorder among veterans for 2 months now. Surprisingly, people dont know much about it. They should, especially since the war in Iraq is supposed to produce an unprecedented number of vet's returning with severe psychological damage (there are 3000+ troops dead already).
I have to take a final now. I have so many things to do and literally, not enough time to do them before 4am wed. morning.
I think this year needs reflecting over. Not now, too much too soon."

I guess I should'nt have written that response, I mean it's myspace for fucksake but I had one of those moments, it felt like a switch flickering, one that permits malice instead of saying ""pray for your enemies"".

And so I beat him at his own synthetic game of writing jumbled bullshit and calling it art. And the sad thing is that he actually spent time and effort making up a false identity for himself, and it only took me a matter of minutes to rip it to peices and I must say, it just sounds better when I say it. Wow- anger? I think a little. How embarassing. If I see him when I come home and he attempts any form of communication my eyes wil see right through him and I'll go on my merry way and he simply wont exist.
I screamed 'bitch' at my roomate.
She is weird and calculating, and holds things against us when we did'nt know there were standards. She tried to accuse me of vandalism in a meeting she set up with the RD yesteray. I let her hang herself. Dave agreed that it would be difficult to vandalize property without touching it. I'll admit it, I smirked.

(it's very late and I have FINALS and packing but this weekend I'm showing a touring musician named Jay around the city. He is a nice boy, but kind of seems like he's into jesus. that's good because I'm celibate. Yeah, I feel ridiculous about prior claims that I almost very nearly barely and did not quite make. Hello reality, sometimes I have to remind myself that I'm not actually stupid and that maybe I should use a little discretion. It's scary- the transformations we almost make. It's scary, the openness that we beg others into despite how we've already seen it end, over and over like a reoccuring dream. I just want my house, my job, I want to drive on the freeway for no reason and smoke indoors even though I'll feel rude about it, I want all that comfortable boring shit. However, I do not want heartbreak. And it takes two to tango, so I'll be the one who says,'you know it's not a good idea. i am not a good idea'. so on and soforth, so self-deprecating but no actually, I happen to be able to predict the future (mostly based on the past).

When I arrive home, it will be to a juggernaut of difference. Strange things are happening, and although this is irrelevant, I must call 59 Diner to tell them when I can start working again. That's right- I'll wear the black uniform once again for your viewing pleasure. I'm excited about the techie's senior show. I'm glad I get to be there for it and the reception and whatnot.

Today I was homesick and felt this odd desire for one person and one person only to make it better. Then I thought: 'wtf? well this is precocious'. I am free of all fear and that, I know, is a potentially hazardous thing. The woodwork is exposing an onslought of uninvited guests - they convolute the best one: the guest I have yet to invite, but ultimately, I'd cancel and throw everyone out if he showed up at my doorstep.

"event","I recieved my graduation picture in the mail after mom told me -months ago- that she'd lost the order form and, ""did you really want them?"". It was a stunning, unexpected image. I unfold this large navy blue parchment to find this glossy photograph of myself, swallowed in black robes and tassles and colored hoods, diploma clasped across my chest, huge shiny red smile, eyes bright and overwhelmed with emotion. One single tear, streaking a white rivulet down my face.

I looked at this girl who is me and my breath caught in my throat because now I know that there's a definite point on this graph of growing up, where you stop being who you were and start being who you are. And yes, they're two different things, and yes, that is sad. But you get over it.

This girl had flawless clear skin and weighed about 100 pounds from the 3 prior weeks of starving to fit into that vintage 1950's prom dress and was about to know loss for the first time. Yeah, I'm starting to really feel happy again, I'm glad mom sent the pic now instead of 4 months ago."

"event","Tuesday night: third night I could not sleep
So I called my dad
Told him about how the night before I had the inexplicable need to leave my bed, find the dirty blanket I use to lay on in central park and walk with it to the bathroom (the room I loathe most in this apartment b/c it's fucking filthy). I turned the light on, sat on the floor -for NO REASON- and suddenly became more distraught than I've been in 8 months. No reason. I barely remember it- just the mechanical actions- but it was like I was under hypnosis.

So all of the sudden, I get these photographic images, playing like a movie reel infront of me after 30 minutes of complete blankness: the first was of several bottles of perscription drugs and then, me pouring them all at once into my mouth and swallowing (kay- here's where I emphasize that I do not fantasize about committing suicide as I've learned through abundant experience with losing others, that I'd sooner be able to build a successful time machine before I'd ever see offing myself as a solution.)The second image was of a blue womens' razor cutting longways against a wrist. And the last and most random was of my brothers ex-girlfriend Marisa, whom I've always felt unusually protective of (?), lying in a bathtub as the water turned red. I guess I should mention that she'd done this the last week I was in town and my brother saved her life over the phone. After these images, my head goes fucking blank again and the room gets very dark and everything feels heavy- like it weighs a ton- and I feel like everything has become slow motion, like going under anesthesia. I stopped breathing, I mean I seriously did'nt feel the need to breathe anymore and it felt too heavy and my body went limp b/c I seriously could not control it. 

(the only time this has even slightly happened before was when i was fifteen and I went into clinical shock b/c I'd witnessed the most disturbing thing of my life and blacked out.)

So, I fell back on the bathroom floor, not able to breathe, or blink or have any concious deliberate motion and not caring. The room flooded with black and I passed out (?). I dont know how much later, I jerked up, knew that I had not been breathing for the last 2 minutes atleast, but was'nt gasping or out of breath. It was fucking weird. All the sudden I was completely lucid and looked around like, 'what the fuck am i doing in here?' And I got up and went to bed. The next day I found out that Marisa had commited suicide shortly before I'd had this experience. She took a couple bottles of perscription pills. I haven't cried about it, I haven't really even grieved for her because I've got this overwhelming feeling that she was with me. Nothing can describe the feeling, I dont know how to feel.
Dad-who most people know about- said he'd known I'd develope it since i was 5 but was'nt going to say anything until it started happening naturally. He said he knew it would start happening now since i was 5, and to tell me to be careful when it started b/c I'm empathic to the point of personal danger. Wow- it feels good to say all this shit, I haven't told anyone. I'm happy it's friday"

This morning I woke up to a black room and was, soon after, reminded of who it belonged to. I had shoved myself into the crack between the wall and the bed during the night and my head was swimming with: 'shit i have class-what time is it?-where the hell are my shoes-i've got a hangover-how long will it take to get the hell out of here? etc. It was the worst feeling. And I kept thinking 'I love Adrian' which is futile because I had done nothing wrong- atleast not to him but I felt so guilty. I've got this image of he and I at the beach and he's smiling broadly like he used to instead of not seeing me behind the blacker-than-black bug eyed lenses of his Gucci sunglasses.

Ick this is depressing stuff. My mom would say ""this too shall pass"".
It's really not so bad, today the sun was out for the 3rd consecutive day and it made me happy. I guess the brightside is that I've fufilled the universal 'fireman' fantasy. I need to find a more beneficial means of distraction."

It was not unprovoked, horrific as it sounds, and the slightest hint of a black shiner is forming on my left eye but I doubt it'll turn into anything a little makeup cant fix. There is much to this story that transcends explanation but that -above all else- deserves addressing. There worst treatment is always at our own discretion, I'm learning that abuse can sometimes feel better than praise.

My mom left last night, we'd had the best time together and she managed to charm everyone within a 20 mile radius. I'm lucky to have been born to such a person. She told me some things, however, that scare me very much. I could not have dreamed up the secrets that my family has been hiding, and last friday afternoon mom and I locked ourselves into my bedroom for 3 hours and for that time- we were no longer mother and daughter but rather, friends bound together by the greatest of forces. She told me: ""you've always been older than me, you were born already knowing the terrifying things that I've never even been able to tell myself"". And I feel this tremendous sense of repsonsibility because she deserves the best but has always gotten the worst and my dad, who I respect and love above all else, is guilty of wrongs that I cant quite forgive: but he did them to her and not me and I must remember that.

Last Wednesday my 8:30 class was cut short when cops informed us we had to vacate the building immediatley. Some kid had jumped from the ledge of his apartment that's in the same building as our school and landed on the roof that is level with the library. If I had looked out the window from my classroom, I'd have seen him, a few feet away, lying face down in the snow: my roomate DID look out the window, and told me -in detail- what she'd seen. This has strangely effected me b/c anyone who knows me well knows that suicide has been the most frequent form of tragedy in my life.

Adrian is coming in a day. He'll be here for 2 weeks. Our situation is much changed- and suddenly, love isn't as powerful a thing as he once thought. I could have told you that, darling."

I'm at school in the 'cafe' and I just heard the word STORMWATCH. I kind of like it, even though it makes everyone act and feel overdramatic, giving everyone an excuse to be jumpy and excited and unpredictable.

My mom arrives here in 2 days
Stuart the day after
Adrian, 5 days after him.

Stuart and Adrian have gotten out of hand, both are now threatening to 'kick' the other's 'ass'. It makes me feel uncomfortable, because neither seems to have a solid grip on themselves- they're both unrealsitic and quite unpredictable. Stuart's been terrorizing my boyfriend for weeks, he pulled the plug on him during open mic at Helio's and the next week, told him that he would'nt ever allow him to play again because his music was ""shitty- and not music"". Then he went on to tell his whole crew and several other observers that he was going to ""fuck Adrian's girlfriend- Again -when he gets to New York. Now Adrian wants me to give him STuart's number and forbids me to ever speak to him again. That's fine with me, I just wish he'd ignore him. It freaks me out.

Ick, I have not yet been moved to 'fuck' other people. I think my boyfried doesn't want to sleep with me anymore. Jeez, I do believe I've been here before, I just nebver thought it would be because HE was fucking someone else. Strange. I must go smoke in the snow before tech crew. Ick."

"event","Last night 3:38 a.m.: I was lying in a semi-concious fever sleep and all of the sudden, I snapped upright with a look of complete horror on my face and realized that the dream I'd been having was really an exact word-for-word reinactment of the hour before I fell asleep. It was like watching a recording of myself. I'd had a phone conversation with Adrian that ended badly- we had'nt fought or even said anything remotely negative, but I had almost said some dangerous stuff and when he wanted to get off the phone b/c he was tired I got extremely frustrated b/c, all of the sudden, I'm incapable of expressing any kind of fear or emotion to him. Bad fucking sign. When I got off the phone I was so raging pissed off that I almost shattered the phone into a thouand peices against the wall. It was the same helpless feeling I'd get after Nathan and I's conversations- like falling backwards b/c I could feel the wall building up between us. 

That dream was like a huge flashing warning sign: I've got to start living my life.

Ever heard of an 'open relationship'? Yes, it's when you fuck other people. Well, I did'nt think that I was in one- officially speaking. Adrian's so unusual and uninhibited that I actually considered it seriously when he laid it down like an appealing business proposition. The truth is that I have absolutely no doubts about his love for me, and the distance is an unignorable factor and I dont want to be in one of those serious-as-a-heart-attack relationships, so I mused that it could actually work.I'm not even sure that I officially agreed to it. Friday night was ""the night"", but I had no desire to fuck anyone. That's just not how it works- I dont go to dance clubs on 80's night and take off my clothes and makeout with anyone I think is hot. But-no doubt- I respect that in others. Believe it or not, that was part of the appeal with Adrian.....So, I go out Friday, make a night of drinking champagne with Fernando and Reagan, come home in a fantastic mood- all the while wondering ""maybe he's actually going to do it?"" 

I call him around 4a.m.- no answer.
Again 30 minutes later: he picks up on the first ring and frantically says, ""can I call you back in an hour?"" Then I heard it: the chirpy voice of a 17 year old girl whose words are clipped short by Adrian's.
Needless to say, it's all I've been able to think about. Once you're boyfriend fucks someone you dont know, and it's not even cheating, something strange starts happening to you. It's an intense, jealous, enraged, turned-on feeling. It's been causing problems b/c I've told NO-ONE about what actually happened, and now I'm kind of afraid of my own boyfriend. But the greater point being: fuck it, I will not let this destroy me. I have my own life, my own world and even though I may not take advantage of the loophole in our relationship, I've got shit to do and oh snap I'm gonna do it. (dont you just love those epiphanies?)"

One complaint I have is the fucking wind here- it's mean and unnaturally forceful. It'll turn your hair into a whip and blast you're eyes til you're blind and for some reason it's produces irrational rage in me. When the wind blows hard I have an urge to scream ""FUCK!"" and kick one of those tiny sniveling rat dogs that is dressed like Paris Hilton.

I'm obsessed with writing and documentation, it's all I think about, all I want to do. Presently I'm looking at schools in Manhattan to transfer to where I can double major in acting and playwriting, if even that. If not next fall, I'll be there next spring. I'm beginning to wonder if there's a future for someone like me as a recluse, because on Friday nights I find myself sitting at Starbucks pouring over my comp. notebook, purposely ignoring the blonde Versace model who's sitting next to me trying to strike up a conversation. Yes, this actually happened: he sat next to me when the entire place was empty and I could see him staring and smiling at me in my peripheral vision and I did nothing to acknowledge him until he directly asked me some profound question about the meaning of life or something. Two months ago I'd have jumped hurdles to even appear in his plane of vision, but I dunno, I was in the middle of writing a very beautiful sentence. I think I'm really developing in my writing, I'm finding I'm more unpredictable than I originally thought.

Right now I'm writing a sort of dissertation on the semantics of the word 'Love'- whether or not it's retractable. I dunno, I passionately believe that there's a cavernous difference between 'loving' someone and being 'in love'. Does anyone find that as interesting as I do? On a random note, I miss my friends. I have no girl friends here, which sucks b/c I've never been 'one of the boys' and for some reason my friends seemed to have lost the ability to dial numbers into a keypad. Weird.

I made the best valentine EVER. It's a 50's pinup style photograph, partial nudity done tastefully involving a strategically placed paper heart that says ""EYE CANDY"" (think upper region, not lower). I'm eternally grateful to my roomate who spent 45 minutes taking picture after picture of me which I would look at and then exclaim, ""eew gross no way!"" or ""my arm looks fat, take another one"". This is how I've earned the title 'naked roomate' among my suitemates.

Relationships are very startling- they always change- they never stay the same.
When you decide to be with someone, it's because they have something that you need, even if it's completely unconcious and if you knew what you were getting into initially, you'd run screaming in the other direction. I know why I needed to be with Mikey: I needed to get my heart bashed in and learn that falling in love is worth every ounce of fear you end up with when it's all over. I know why I needed to be with Nathan: I needed to get over my phobia of falling in love with someone I coud'nt handle and just jump the fuck in. I needed to be grotesquely vulnerable, I needed the tables to turn and most of all, I needed to be wrong for once. I made heinous mistakes, fucked up a delicate trust and fell in love too late. I know what being wrong feels like better than most. I also know that I am not a whore, nor am I a terrible person. I'm taking full responsibility for my actions and calling me a whore and a terrible person is excusing me from owning my mistakes; it's like being completely sane, then pleading temporary insanity when you've murdered 5 people.

-listened to old mixes and felt sad, then blessed because I knew him.

Please love me when I'm far far away. I need it baaaaad."

"event","Today there was fighting with the best friend: the legitimate kind. I'm trying my best to be forgiving, it's not my biggest talent.
My brother drove me to see my dad. 
There has been a huge lack of parental visiting this trip, I miss them.
I've also decided that I hate 21 Grams, it's the bleakest well made movie ever.

I leave Thursday. Adrian's doing the standoffish thing right now which I dont blame him for- there isn't much room for butterflies right now but at night I get seperation anxiety because it's starting to feel odd going to bed without him. I think we stabilize one another, neither of us are in a period of real normalcy, but I'm happy all the same.

Em has her own apartment now, I helped her move saturday and now I'm sore as a motherfuck. 
Then we all went bowling, there were 8 of us total and omigod, bowling is addictive and wonderful and even though I consistently got the lowest scores of the group, I think I've found my anti-drug. Oh who the fuck am I kidding.
Sleeeeeeeeeeeep."

"event","Things I Love:
1. Garden State and its phenomenal soundtrack
2. bowling, even though it means a royal ass kicking
3. going to pretencious nightclubs dressed like someone I'm not
4. waking up in the morning next to someone who could'nt be more different from me but somehow is convinced that I look my most beautiful with bedhead and last nights makeup bleeding from my eyes.

I have'nt been honest about school and exactley how much I hate it. But here it is: I'm shit scared of something and I dont really know what it is, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it's being alone. I was'nt capable of admitting that until this morning because I called Nia yesterday and she's most likely not going back to New York.

(my heart is breaking)

But now I'm capable of saying, yes, I'll be alone in a vast intimidating city with -literally- no one to talk to and there's a reason for it. Ever have to remind yourself that no matter how afraid you are, it cant kill you?

""The danger of getting butterflies is that they're a precursor for loving someone""----when I go back to New York it'll be with a swollen heart and cd of unlikely love songs and the balls to negotiate a hefty contract for my first film. Yeah, I said it."

january 27th please dont ever come, I think I like this more than I expected.

Tonight we went to pf chang's and Adrian blew some cash, his favorite hobby. He finds me overly conservative with money because I dont like to be an expensive date and I find it flattering and a little overwhelming that he wants me to be one. Then we went fake shopping at the galleria where he dictated the entire spring line of Dior and I admitted that he was the only human being thus far that has succesfully dragged me there. I'll start detaching, ummm, later."

"event","Tonight I went on a date without knowing it.
I want to be a girl who never falls for anyone.
What I'm doing right now is so stupid, so dangerous. I leave in 17 days and after 48 hours of being with one person, it's blatantly clear that my heart is being robbed directly from my chest. I know this because I cant breath easy when I've said goodnight and walked to my front porch. The second I'm alone my head spins a little and I realize that, yes, he's having a great effect and he makes me think too much. I did not want to think this much. I did not want to be needed like I thought and least of all, I cant stand to need him. Oh my god I cant believe I'm so angry and fearful about falling for a boy. He's not right for me. He's a nineteen year old boy with a 9 month old son and an Interpole haircut.

Okay, I'm going to stop hyperventilating.

I thought I knew what love was but someone told me that it was'nt real and I was fool enough to believe them. I blame that person, even though it's juvenile to do so.

Tomorow I'm going to the galleria with Adrian to refill my red lipstick perscription, I cant believe I dont mind being dragged there. It's really lonely without Emily and Claire, I have no one to draw strength from regarding this bizarre relationship. 
I miss girls and I'm utterly exhausted."

Stevie (Had) A Gun permit but it's been pulled from this weekend's auction of music and film memorabilia on the Left Coast. 

The Monterey Pop! auction expected Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler's 1998 New Hampshire gun permit to cop a cool $400 when it went on the block Saturday. 

But after the rocker rang up the sale's promoters the other day and told them his whole world could come undone if the expired license got into the wrong hands, it was taken off the block. 

``It was a cool piece,'' promoter Darren Julien told the Track. ``But Tyler did call himself and he was so nice about it, I was happy to pull it.'' 

The pop star told the Pop! peddler the permit issued to Steven Victor Tallarico (his real name) had lots of personal info on it. 

And if someone was gunnin' for him, his credit report ain't never gonna be the same!"

From NY Post  August 4, 2004
Hamptons Diary

Let's just call them girlie men.

Fashion spotters may have noticed that rockers Dave  Navarro and Steven Tyler 
have spent the past few  months wearing Rock & Republic jeans -- even though 
the label is launching  its men's line only this week.

That's because Navarro and Tyler have been wearing the women's  line.

An insider confided to Diary at a party for the label at Norah's in  
Southampton that Tyler bought up several pairs of girls' jeans in April during  an 
Aerosmith shopping trip to Toronto store T & T.

Navarro, meanwhile, has worn his girls' jeans during celebrity poker  matches 
in Las Vegas and even at a party for wife Carmen  Electra's birthday."

"event","<i>Aerosmith going strong, but say music industry collapsing 
ERIC TALMADGE, Associated Press
July 27, 2004
10:54:00 AM PDT</i>

TOKYO (AP) - As the gates at the Tokyo Dome were just opening and thousands 
of fans beginning to stream in for the night's sold-out show, Aerosmith lead 
singer Steven Tyler offered a simple explanation of what it feels like to be 
rock 'n' roll icon:

<i>""First of all, you walk out in front of 42,000 people,""</i> Tyler said as he and 
guitarist Joe Perry waited backstage, the smell of incense wafting through the 
air and the sound of distant drums reverberating through the walls. <i>""It's 
like taking a wire, stripping it, wrapping it around your neck, and plugging it 
into the wall.</i>

<i>""Either your head pops, or you learn to love it.""</i>

Tyler's head has survived. And Aerosmith has proven to be one of the most 
successful - and long-lived - bands in the history of the business. But the 
business, they say, is in need of a major makeover.

This spring, Aerosmith released their 14th studio album, ""Honkin' on Bobo,"" 
and embarked on a 40-city North American tour, which was one of the year's top 
grossers. They've headlined the Super Bowl pregame show. Tyler now has an 
honorary doctorate in music from Berklee College of Music; Perry has his own hot 
sauce.

<i>""Every dream we ever had came true, and then some,""</i> Tyler said. <i>""With our 
children, with a roller coaster at Disney World, with Super Bowls, with Grammys. 
To come to Japan and have the fans love us and embrace us like they do, it's 
just insane.""</i>

Insane isn't necessarily bad.

Always a popular draw in Japan, the band's seven-city tour filled some of the 
country's biggest stadiums with audiences that provide a diverse - though 
slightly baby-boomer heavy - sampling of Japanese demographics. The older fans, 
in their 40s or early 50s, waited to hear ""Walk This Way,"" circa 1975. The high 
school kids yelled for ""Jaded,"" the hit from 2001.

For Tyler, the philosophy of a hit is pretty straightforward.

<i>""Three minutes of perfection, that's what a song is,""</i> he said. <i>""It's 
something that makes you feel good when you put it on, end of story.</i>""

Getting a handle on what makes people feel good is a knack Tyler said he has 
never had much trouble cultivating. With album sales in excess of 100 million, 
it's hard to argue otherwise.

<i>""You just ride it like a wave, and you pay attention to what's happening,""</i> he 
said. <i>""We knew very well what people were dancing to around the tribal fires 
early on.""</i>

Tyler admitted, however, that the creative inspiration didn't always flow 
naturally.

<i>""We were big on drugs, because we loved it, we loved the exhilaration,""</i> he 
said. <i>""We cut through the '80s on drugs.""</i>

They've since toned that down. Tyler, now 56, for a time was on a salmon 
diet. And guitarist Perry seeks his offstage thrills on a water ski at 60 miles 
per hour.

They've also grown rich and famous enough to take a step back from the 
industry - and they don't necessarily like what they see.

""The business has changed 100 percent since we got started,"" said Perry. 
""It's a totally different thing. It's gotten so huge and overblown. Now it's mel
ting in front of our eyes like a glacier in the tropics. It's totally 
collapsing.""

Perry said the increasing focus on sales and marketing has shut out many 
talented young bands who can't get signed, and squelched creativity in favor of 
the familiar.

""It's always been the case that the record company says, 'That's not a 
single,' but it somehow slips through the cracks and becomes the next big thing,"" he 
said. ""But now, the industry has gotten so big and there's so much money to 
be made and there's so many bands, it's harder to make a mark.""

Perry believes that the era of the Super Band - like Aerosmith, which was 
inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame three years ago - may also be over.

""I don't know if you'll ever get another world-changing phenomenon like the 
Beatles,"" he said. ""But there's music being made today that will stand the test 
of time. People will play it in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and it will end 
up on greatest hits compilations.""

Tyler agreed.

<i>""There's a huge wave right now of everybody following the trend, which makes 
everything sound the same,""</i> he said.

But Aerosmith is still willing to explore.

<i>""We could tour for the rest of our lives without putting out another studio 
album,""</i> he said, but <i>""it's great playing new things off of a new album. That's 
what we're addicted to.""</i>

7/18/2004

We're on the bullet train heading up to Tokyo. Riding the Shinkansen is a 
special treat for Americans. I know we've probably mentioned this a hundred 
times. We don't have great trains in the States. It's probably because the distance 
in America is so great we just automatically jump on a plane. Some people are 
trying to make train travel better. It's so much easier.

We played in Nagoya last night, or should I say, yesterday afternoon. Going 
on at 5:00 is a little weird for us. On the way over to the gig we feel like we 
just finished lunch. But once we you're inside the building the darkness 
fools you into thinking its late at night. Hey, It works for me. Pretty soon you 
forget what time it is and it feels like a gig anywhere. 

I thought we played really good last night. We added Temperature, one of the 
songs on the Bobo album. On the album it's kind of laid back and low key but 
live it felt more intense and full of energy. Joe's been fighting to get that 
song added to the set for a long time. We should have tried it a long time ago. 


We had to cancel the show in Hiroshima the other day due to Steven's injury 
from the Show in Osaka. We were playing Walk This Way as the last song of the 
set. Steven was down at the end of the ramp that goes out into the middle of 
the audience. He was dancing around and accidentally stepped right off into 
space. He hurt his knee really badly and scraped some skin off his shin. I didn't 
even see it happen. We left the stage for the encore break and then went out 
and played two more songs. I had no idea what happened because he hid it so 
well. What a trooper.

We're really sorry that we couldn't play in Hiroshima. Hopefully, next time 
we come to Japan we'll make it up.

So, anyway, we're having a great time and look forward to the rest of the 
shows. I can't believe we're playing after The Who at the two festivals. They 
were one of my hero bands when I was a teenager learning to play. I remember how 
exciting it was when the Tommy album came out. It was one of the first times 
anyone did an album with a concept and story line that went all the way 
through. It makes me want to go straight to the record store in Tokyo and get it. I 
have at least two copies at home but of course I forgot to bring them. It also 
makes me want to go straight to my room and practice!

"event","As you know the Hiroshima show was canceled because of Steven's leg. I was 
really looking forward to going there, I have never been. We had plans to go to 
the War Museum but stayed in Osaka instead. If Tokyo is considered like New 
York City then Osaka would be like Chicago. Plenty to do there and some great 
Sushi places too. 

From Osaka we took the bullet train to Nagoya. We stayed in our usual hotel 
in Nagoya which is right across the street from The Hard Rock. Brad and his 
family were frequent visitors there as well as Tony Perry. We even had a little 
crew party there after the show. Joey's drum tech ""McGee"" is fluent in the 
native tongue and had 3 young ladies by his side the whole night.

We were lucky enough to be in Nagoya during the Sumo Wrestling Championships. 
Joe really wanted to go. He had been to Sumo matches in the past and wanted 
to bring his kids to see it. It was great! It goes on for 12 Days with each 
Sumo fighting once a day. These guys were big but they could move. I have the 
utmost respect for them. They put on a great show too.

It was great getting back to work in Nagoya. With Steven's injury it gave us 
3 days off in a row. You should have seen his leg. It looked like he shaved 
his leg with a cheese grater! He stayed off of it for the whole day after it 
happened but now it was back to work. This guy is unreal, he was running and 
moving and put on a great show. His voice benefited from the rest too and you 
could tell. Nagoya was the best show in my book so far.

The day after Tokyo we took the train for a day trip to Kyoto to visit the 
Temples. Joe asked Ross Halfin and his assistant Kaz to come along to take some 
photos. Half way through we got caught in a Monsoon.  Ross looked very manly 
with his see threw umbrella.

Steven and Brad went to Universal studio's with Donny Wightman. Donny has his 
own page on Ross's sight. Be sure to check it out.

On the train Joe bumped into members of The Ventures. The Ventures are an 
early 60's instrumental band and have maintained a huge following in Japan. I'm 
sure you know there big hit, Theme for Hawaii 5-0. Founder Don Wilson told Joe 
that they were in the middle of a 80 date tour of Japan. Image that! 80 dates 
in 90 days. You better like trains to do that.

Ross took us to a bootleg store. They had a lot of Aerosmith stuff there 
audio and video. We picked up about 50 DVD's and the guy there gave them to Joe 
for an autograph or 2.

Went out to dinner with Tom and his wife Terry, Jimmy Eyers, Chino and Nana 
from Sony and some of the fantastic UDO crew. We went to a place called ""Hama."" 
Had some great steak and also had some freshly killed shrimp. That was a 
first for me!  I noticed the shrimp were moving on this big silver platter before 
the chef threw them on the grill in front of us. They weren't moving for long, 
however. Save the nasty chatter, they were delicious...

The Tokyo show was great too. 43,000 well knowledge fans in attendance even 
The Ventures were there!. You can sense the end of the tour is coming, however. 
It's bitter sweet. Like I said last week the guys plan to take a year off and 
get back to work on a brand new CD and huge tour to follow. Even though they 
are going to be off the road I'm sure they will have plenty of projects to 
keep everybody interested.

To touch on the set a bit. The guys have been playing Milk Cow Blues from 
Draw the Line and dusted off One Way Street one show. Back Back Train has been 
going over great. Cryin' and I Don't Want to Miss A Thing are Ross Halfin's 2 
favorite songs so he usually puts his camera's down and enjoys those 2 songs 
before getting back to work.

Our crew have been busting ass all tour and the guys and girls behind the 
scenes sometimes get overlooked. Hat's off to Charlie Hernandez and his crew for 
putting up the stage each and every night. They are a CLASS act. All 40 of 
them!

I hope you guys like reading this stuff as much as I like doing it. Next week 
I'll recap or last week in Japan.

See you on the road!

Thanks to a hearty plug from Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, a nonprofit 
based in his hometown of Marshfield will likely reap big bucks from an annual 
charity benefit hosted by a restaurant Tyler co-owns. 

""This is by far the biggest event we have ever been involved in,'' said an 
elated Ron Bersani, executive director of the Talking Information Center. 

The 26-year-old nonprofit broadcasts 24 hours a day with volunteers reading 
newspapers, magazines, job listings, supermarket sales and more to some 20,000 
visually impaired listeners across Massachusetts who are provided special 
closed-circuit radios to receive the programming. 

""With this kind of event and publicity,'' Bersani said, ``we will have a lot 
of people calling us looking for radios, and we will be able to provide them 
with radios.'' 

Tyler heard about TIC from his optometrist, who is a board member. Then the 
rocker called his partner, Jayne Bowe, at their Norwell restaurant, Mount Blue, 
and put in a good word. 

""I thought that would be a perfect match,'' Bowe said. 

The restaurant's charity shindig last year raised $40,000 for Habitat for 
Humanity. 

This year's garden party event is July 26 and boasts more than 100 items to 
be auctioned off including Red Sox tickets, a two-week trip to New Zealand and, 
of course, autographed Aerosmith paraphernalia.

Thousands packed the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J. for the last 
American show on Aerosmith's ""Honkin' on Bobo"" world tour on June 30. 

The 41-date U.S. leg of the tour featured Aerosmith with special guest Cheap 
Trick. However, due to scheduling problems, Antigone Rising replaced Cheap 
Trick for the final date of the tour. 

Originally scheduled for June 20, the concert was rescheduled due to the 
illness of lead singer Steven Tyler who had a sore throat. 

Antigone Rising, an all-female band, kicked off the performance. Many fans 
were disappointed about Cheap Trick's cancellation, and most people hung around 
outside the arena during the opening act. 

Following some sort of dancing mascot, Aerosmith came out entirely outfitted 
in black clothing, opening with their 1970s hit, ""Toys in the Attic."" 

The 21-song show featured hits like ""Love in an Elevator,"" ""Mama Kin,"" ""Dream 
On,"" and ""Walk this Way."" 

The band also played several blues songs from their new album, ""Honkin' on 
Bobo."" These numbers, mostly remakes of old songs, drift away from the 
traditional Aerosmith we all know and love. 

Aerosmith, who can be argued is a carbon copy of the Rolling Stones, played 
an abbreviated version of the Stones' hit, ""Honky Tonk Woman,"" noting that the 
song was from ""that other band."" 

The band played their encore to a mostly drunken crowd, while barrels of 
streamers shot out from the sides of the arena. Tyler told the crowd that they 
were taking a year off, but they weren't finished. Then Joe Perry, lead 
guitarist, announced that this would be their ""last show in the states for quite 
awhile."" 

Although all five members are now in their 50s, the band continues to delight 
fans of all ages. After more than 30 years of drugs, depression, recovery, 
and support, their music, stage presence, and appearance are still intact and 
the band sounds better than ever.

Once Aerosmith wraps up a six-city concert swing through Japan July 25 in 
support of its ""Honkin' On Bobo"" album, ""We're taking a year off - at least,"" 
reports guitar god Joe Perry. 

One of the last big-hair stadium rock groups going, the mighty band has been 
touring all over the world pretty much since the new millennium got under way. 


""We haven't had more than three weeks off in four years, a lot of times going 
less than three days in a row sleeping in the same bed,"" said Joe, explaining 
their planned hiatus. 

Aerosmith will, however, be in evidence in next year's big-screen ""Be Cool"" 
follow-up to ""Get Shorty."" Elmore Leonard, a fan of the group, wrote them into 
his sequel story, which pleased the bandmates to no end. A sequence was filmed 
with John Travolta and Uma Thurman at a recent Aerosmith concert in Boston. 

Ahead for Joe, in the foreseeable future, will be some time off for ""swimming 
in the Caribbean,"" followed by ""getting the side projects we've had off the 
shelf."" In his case, that may mean a solo album. It will mean more work with 
Memphis-based rockers Porch Ghouls, which Joe has on his Roman Records label - 
""stuff that's fun and restful, too."" 

That stuff includes Perry's contribution to the culinary world - Joe Perry's 
Rock Your World Boneyard Brew barbeque sauce, soon to be followed by a 
Caribbean-influenced Mango Peach Tango sauce.

 <i>07:09:04- News From The Road</i> 

As I write this update I'm on a flight from JFK to Narita Airport in Tokyo. It's exciting but sad. These 7 dates will be the last (possibly) of the Honkin' on Bobo tour. The band plans to take a chunk of time off to recharge their batteries before coming back to assault the masses again. This trip over is a little different. The band usually travels all together to Japan and gather all 
their bags and go through customs then meet the throngs of Japanese fans and camera crews. It's like they want to see for themselves that America's greatest rock and roll band is on their soil. This time, because each guy is bringing their family with them they are on different schedules and we are all coming 
in separate. Joey and Tom along with Russ Irwin and Tour Manager Jimmy Eyers will come in from the west coast. Steven will zig zag around the East. Brad and family stop at Newark Airport and Joe with his family and yours truly drive from Boston to NY the night before and catch a 1:30 PM (really 2:30 because of delays flight to Narita then off to Sapporo. 

I was of thinking of the last tour and how much the tour with KISS and the Honkin' tour just kind of blended into one another. The KISS tour ended before last Christmas and this one started in early March. Throw in a week in Houston for the Super Bowl and it doesn't leave a whole lot of time to get grounded. 

The Honkin' on Bobo tour had it's high points and low points. The high points for me is that the guys were playing with Cheap Trick again. These guys are pro's and have a good time every show. I have never seen a band and crew so nice. Our crew loved them and each crew took care of one another. Weather it was 
Brad's tech Greg Howard filling in for Robin's tech Colin who couldn't make it to a few of the show's or Colin helping Jim Survis move Joe's pedal every night during ""Walk This Way."" At the end of the tour the Bad Boys from Boston gave the Rockford Illinois quartet each a beautiful Bose Soundwave stereo with 
the wings logo on the front of the travel case. 

Another high point for me was the great set that was put together. It blended everything from the whole catalog. It's not easy for this band to agree on a setlist, but I thought they did a pretty good job mixing the new, old and moldy. When in doubt play Mama Kin! You got to remember when the guys make the 
setlist it's like planing a 5 course dinner. Start with a kickass appetizer that will knock your socks off and whet your appetite then come in with something to cleanse the palate that is familiar to you. Then serve up something that you 
haven't had in a while and try to remember why you liked it in the first place. Next course is an old standby that goes great with anything and finish it up with a tasty desert that never fails to satisfy. 

The low points were obviously when Steven's voice went south in the South. Ever since the Nine Lives tour the band play as you know one day on and one day off. Except when at the end of the leg. The shows were going great but I think with all the change in weather it caught up with the dusty codger. He needed 
to rest the larynx or he wouldn't be talking much less singing for a while. After a few bumps in the road the guys ended the US date on all cylinders. <i>Holmdel stands out in my mind as one of the best of the last leg.</i> 

When we landed in Indy for the show. Joe's bus driver was there to pick us up and take us to the show. He told us as we were landing that Don Prudhomme was hanging out near the bus. He had just landed for Florida or somewhere. A lot of you are thinking ""who the hell is Don Prudhomme? If you were a boy born in the 60's like me you worshipped Don Prudomme and Big Daddy Don Garlits. The were drag racers and were like rockstars. Don was a gentleman and couldn't wait 
to meet the guys. Everyone in the band (except Brad, figures) were really excited to meet this living legend. He help put racing on the map and without his help you would have racing like it is today. The guys exchanged swag and were on their way. 

Well, it's time to put the tray table away and the seat in the upright position so I have to go but I will update you guys on this Japanese trip soon. Let me end by saying how much I enjoy going to Japan. If you ever in your lifetime get to go to an Aerosmith show in Japan do it. The crowd listens to every 
word and note and they focus on every move. They are some of the most knowledgeable fans I have ever met. 

Until next time, 

See You on the road! 

John B."

Steven Tyler doesn't Want to Miss A Thing when it comes to his daughter's pregnancy. In fact, on Mother's Day, Aerosmith frontman sent Liv Tyler flowers and a card that read ``Happy Mother's Day - oh, not yet I know but soon I hope!'' before she had breathed a word of the good news to Mom or Dad. ``I was so shocked,'' the actress told People magazine. ``I couldn't believe it. I knew I was pregnant, but he didn't know yet.''

CBS News' THE EARLY SHOW weatherman Dave Price served as Aerosmith's ""roadie"" for the day and gained exclusive backstage access during the band's concert on Saturday in Hershey, Pa. Price dishes on his ""roadie"" experience, including playing the maracas on stage with the band, Additionally, lead singer Steven Tyler, guitarist Joe Perry, and bassist Tom Hamilton sat down with EARLY SHOW correspondent Tracy Smith prior to the concert. Tyler tells Smith that the band has managed to stick together through so many ups and downs because ""we're the epitome of old school."" He says, ""I have given that some thought, though: either we're too stupid to break up or we never made enough money."" Tyler also discusses his latest undertaking -- becoming a grandfather. ""Lord, have mercy! Does this mean I have to change my toenail color?"" The one thing Tyler wants his future grandchild to learn from his life is ""that not getting what you want may be a great thing."" Smith's interview also previews the band's latest music video, ""Baby Please Don't Go.""

I missed it. I had it taped Wednesday morning, but they rescheduled for it to air THIS morning. We obviously were driving home and had no idea. So I missed it."

"event","Aerosmith's rockin' frontman Steven Tyler explains his band's staying power (after all, it has been 34 years of ups and downs) to CBS News's ""Early Show"" correspondent Tracy Smith, saying: <i>""We're the epitome of old school.""</i> But he adds: <i>""I have given that some thought, though: Either we're too stupid to break up or we never made enough money.""</i> 

And is the ever-youthful Tyler, 56, excited about the prospect of being a, gasp!, grandfather? (Daughter Liv Tyler, married to musician Royston Langdon, is reportedly pregnant.) <i>""Lord have mercy! Does this mean I have to change my toenail color?""</i>

What was he saying about being old school again?

MANSFIELD -- Aerosmith returned home Thursday, giving tens of thousands of fans more than 20 songs over two hours that showed the band's vitality. 

Steven Tyler came with his fabric-draped microphone stand as his dance partner, swinging it and rocking it toward guitarist Joe Perry. Aerosmith being Aerosmith, the concert at the Tweeter Center was a medley of excess, particularly during ""Walk This Way."" Tyler took a scarf from the audience, did obscene things with it, grabbed a cowboy hat from the audience, ran from his mike, hopped onto a trapeze and swung out, upside down, above the crowd. 

For all his antics, some of Tyler's biggest applause came when he said, <i>""God, it's good to be home""</i> before the band launched into a smoking ""Dream On."" 

Aerosmith opened its set with a song from its first big album, ""Toys in the Attic."" The show encompassed Aerosmith's more than three decades, including several off their latest barroom blues album, ""Honkin' on Bobo."" In one song, Tyler disappeared to leave Perry sitting on a cocktail lounge chair playing slide on an electric resonator guitar and singing with a gravely voice. 

Perry described the latest album as ""Blues, Boston style."" 

People who missed the Tweeter Center show will still get a chance to hear part of it. The concert was recorded and filmed for ""Be Cool,"" a sequel to ""Get Shorty"" that had actress Christina Milian join Aerosmith on stage ... for ""Cryin'"" ... three times. If anything, by the third go-'round the crowd was more enthusiastic."

<u>Interesting Notes:</u>
<i>- During Cryin', some lady grabbed Steven's manhood. He eloquently stated ""Ya'll can't go around grabbing my dick"". 
- After WTW, Steven told the crowd it would be 20,000 dollars for every ten minutes they go overtime. He told the crowd to start passing the bucket around</i>

Additional Notes From Various Goers:

<u>Additional Notes:</u>

The show started VERY VERY VERY Late. Tickets said 7:30, outside the venue it said 8, and Cheap Trick started around 8:30-8:45. That is why they were going to get fined $20,000.00 for each 10 minutes after 11:00. Steven asked some guy behind the drums, ""How much we gotta pay....shit, $20 thou every 10 mins? Start passing the bag around...""

The band was running around the stage like nuts, going as fast as they could between songs, as I imagine they'll be getting a fine, since the concert ended at 11:30. Do the math--- $60,000.00. But if Hershey wants Aerosmith to return, I'm sure it'll be much less.

""Baby Please Don't Go"" was definitely a highlight of the night. They played an extended version. In fact most of their songs were extended tonight. They played them all a lil bit longer then usual. BPDG had a really rare jam session in it, that I can't explain except it's kinda like what they do with DTL or Sweet E.

Cool thing was, Steven for the encore came out in a white suit, like the same one Robin Zander wore, and asked if he looked like Robin Zander.

<i>At the end of ""Dream On"" about 4-6 very slow shootingstars
passed. Like exactly as they finished---Steven pointed to the sky. Everybody was shitting themselves, like how the fuck could that be. What a coincidence.</i>
----------------------------------------------------------------

Aerosmith came on at about 9:50 and Ended at 11:40. It was well worth the wait, though. Tyler nailed everything he sang and 
sounded fine. 

I don't recall Tyler adding background vocals or harmonica to BBT, but it was fine, anyway.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yo, the shooting stars were weird as shit...Everyone in the crowd was pointing to the sky....Real cool vibe...Also, I think it was before ""Baby, Please Don't Go"" that they played a snippet of some new song...Steven said, ""Something off the next album""..Could that mean that a next album or compilation album of the remaining songs left over and other stuff is comin sooner than we think?"

BY RICK MASSIMO
Journal Pop Music Writer</i>

Ever since its late-'80s, post-drugs comeback, Aerosmith has straddled the line between real-deal rock and show-biz Cheez-Whiz.And the juxtaposition of grit and glitz was on full display last night at the Tweeter Center, as the boys from Boston managed to cram some steel-guitar blues and big-budget filmmaking into the same two-hour show.

The set opened with ""Toys in the Attic"" and ""Love in an Elevator"" played on a very small stage set up at the end of a ramp in the middle of the crowd, putting rock's Mount Rushmore in high-fiving distance.

Then came the Hollywood moments.

The performance was filmed for the upcoming movie Be Cool, the sequel to Get Shorty, and so a false arena-rock ending to a fictitious preceding tune and the song ""Cryin'"" were done three times (not in a row), with lead singer Steven Tyler joined by guest vocalist Christina Milian.

The show dragged during these created moments, but Tyler was capable at filling up the space.

Tyler's ability to sell the same song three times in one night was impressive and unsettling at the same time. And why Aerosmith, at this point, needs to cut up a show to get into a movie is a mystery.

Then again, at this point they can do whatever they want to. That's show biz.

The Aerosmith set list is a hard one to crack -- with so many classics such as ""Walk This Way,"" ""Draw the Line,"" ""Dream O"" and ""Same Old Song and Dance"" that can't be left out, what do you put aside in favor of new songs?

But the band managed to get in several selections from Honkin' on Bobo, its latest album, which is a collection of takes on blues classics.

Now, if Aerosmith was trying to be a blues band, it wouldn't be much of one. But as the post-filming part of the evening showed, the blues is in its DNA; it's the unified field theory of Aerosmith, the set of factors that explains everything else. Well, maybe not the drecky ""Don't Want to Miss a Thing,"" which was the first encore.

But even poppy songs such as ""Jaded"" and the ubiquitous ""Cryin'"" benefit from the stomp and swagger shown on ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and ""Stop Messin' 'Round,"" from Honkin' on Bobo (the latter of which guitarist Joe Perry sang, along with the steel-guitar-led ""Back Back Train."")

To say the expectant grandpa Tyler showed the energy of someone half his age -- swinging upside-down on a trapeze so as to give an entire section of fans high-fives -- is kind of beside the point.

It used to be that you had to be young to carry on like that, but after decades of rock ennui and grungy angst, maybe you have to be old."

then polled the crowd. ""What Do You Want To Hear? 'Edge' or 'I Don't Want to Miss A Thing."" The crowd went 
NUTS for IDWTMAT so they played that.

BY JIM FARBER
New York Daily News

The guys in Aerosmith don't want you to get the wrong idea. 

True, their new CD, Honkin' on Bobo, is billed as their first all-blues 
album. 

But guitarist Joe Perry emphasizes, ""We're not out to educate people about 
the blues. We're not blues crusaders and we're not a blues band."" 

<i>""We know that all (the critics) are just waiting to say, 'This doesn't sound 
like a blues record,' ""</i> says singer Steven Tyler, whose band is playing a 
sold-out show at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield tonight. 

At least, it doesn't sound like a traditional blues record. Certainly, no one 
will mistake Bobo for an album by Robert Johnson, Son House, or even for one 
of those sober genre salutes recently served up by Eric Clapton and John 
Mellencamp. 

Instead, Bobo is modeled after the English reinterpretation of American blues 
in the '60s by bands like the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac and the 
Yardbirds. It's a hard-rocking wallop of a CD that treats blues as slamming party music 
rather than as the soul-searching stuff of legend. 

In other words, it's an Aerosmith record. Or, rather, an Aerosmith record of 
the '70s. Indeed, the most exciting aspect of Bobo isn't its blues roots, but 
the fact that it features no ballads, no pop melodies and none of the string 
and horn arrangements that have characterized Aerosmith's commercialized music 
of the past 17 years. 

It's the hardest rocking album the band has released since 1985's Done With 
Mirrors, the CD it cut just before its chart resurrection. 

Surprisingly, Perry says the idea for the blues record originated with 
Columbia Records President Don Ienner in 1996, soon after he lured the band back to 
the label that launched it in the '70s. (In between, it had spent more than a 
decade at Geffen Records.) 

The group wanted to kick off its new contract with something more appealing 
to radio programmers. So the blues idea was put on hold while Aerosmith issued 
slick albums like 1997's 'Nine Lives' and 2001's 'Just Push Play'. 

But last year, the band found itself with a three-month window of opportunity 
before it was set to start a huge tour with Kiss. It turned out their 
producer from the '70s, Jack Douglas, had room on his dance card, too. Their mutual 
idea was to record the band as an organic live unit, as in the old days, rather 
than go through the common pop process of having everyone record their parts 
separately. The goal was to stress feeling over technique. 

""The only time we capture this is when we play live,"" says Perry. ""This was 
our attempt to get that back on a record. It's what the fans have been 
missing."" 

The group had some role models from past recordings, including its version of 
the old blues number ""Train Kept a Rollin' "" from its second album in 1974. 

On Bobo (the blues term's meaning has been lost to history) the band rollicks 
through pieces like Bo Diddley's ""Road Runner"" Sonny Boy Williamson's 
""Eyesight to the Blind"" and Willie Dixon's ""I'm Ready."" The band cut its teeth on 
such pieces in 1970. 

As familiar as its repertoire may be, Aerosmith provides some twists. It 
performs Mississippi Fred McDowell's ""You Gotta Move"" -- best known from the 
Stones version on Sticky Fingers -- but adds new chords and a Bo Diddley beat. 

<i>""We were hellbent on making it our own,""</i> Tyler says. <i>""We made it more 
tribal.""</i> 

The band takes on an even more daunting task by covering the rhythm and blues 
standard ""Never Loved a Man,"" made into a classic by Aretha Franklin. 
Switching the gender, Tyler nails the song. 

<i>""I love songs that open up that way,""</i> he says. <i>""It breaks down and lets just 
the vocal come through.""</i> 

Perry did more lead singing than usual -- on two songs. 

""I'm just starting to find my voice,"" says the 53-year-old. ""I guess I'm a 
late bloomer."" 

Likewise, Aerosmith came into its own as a pop act late in its life. Some 
longtime fans still consider its '80s and '90s hits sellouts. Perry takes the 
point. 

""If you told me, when I was 19 or 20, that we would do songs like 'Dude Looks 
Like a Lady' or 'Don't Want to Miss a Thing,' I would have said, 'Not me, 
brother -- not my band,' "" he says. ""But as you go along you realize that you're 
an entertainer and whether you think it's schmaltz or not, you can't argue 
with a number-one hit."" 

Tyler concurs: <i>""When I sing 'Don't Wanna Miss a Thing,' the crowd roars and 
everybody sings along and I get this incredible feeling in my heart -- and in 
my groin.""</i> 

The singer admits he wants as many people to like the band as possible and 
that he's <i>""addicted to touring.""</i> 

But Perry says that if Bobo sells well, the band may lean further toward hard 
rock again. 

""I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we get some converts to buy an Aerosmith 
record who may not have bought one for a long time,"" he says. ""Then we'll see

"event","<b>Talk this way: Aerosmith's Tyler on throat problems, Pops and Kerry 
By Larry Katz 
Wednesday, June 23, 2004</b> 

Returning from the dentist with a mouth full of Novocain, I get a message. Steven Tyler wants to do our interview. 
Right now. 

<i>``What time did you go to the dentist?''</i> Tyler asks when I explain the reason for my slurred speech. `<i>`For 50 dollars, what time did you go? Now think about it.''</i> 

<i>``Uh, it was 3 o'clock.''</i> 

<i>``Wrong!,''</i> Tyler snaps. `<i>`It was two-th hurty.''</i> 

I groan. He cackles with glee. 

Actually I'm surprised the Aerosmith frontman is talking at all, let alone cracking bad jokes. Tyler's throat problems forced Boston's biggest rock band to cancel its shows last week. 

But you don't have to worry. Tyler, 56, is back in the saddle and Aerosmith's show tomorrow with Cheap Trick at the Tweeter Center is on. And I don't have to worry about trying to hold up my end of a conversation saddled with a benumbed tongue. Once Tyler, speaking by phone from his South Shore home, starts talking, he doesn't need much prodding. He just keeps going and going. 

So, Steven, how's your throat? 

<i>``It's simple. We're on tour for 5, 6, 7 months. If you get a cold, how do you sing on a cold? I gotta rest up. Otherwise there's drugs to take, which can get you through it, but the next day you pay dearly. I took some steroids two weeks ago and wound up canceling a show because of it. (BIRMINGHAM) Then last week we shuffled off to Buffalo where it was 40 degrees on stage. That was all I needed. I woke up the next morning with laryngitis. The doctors said to take time off, so we had to cancel some shows. 

But, y'know, it's rock 'n' roll. It's not how you win or lose, it's how you do your hair. Ha! I sound like I'm gargling with razor blades anyway. 

My throat feels better now, but I haven't spoken until this interview. So if my voice goes south, it's all your fault. 

No, actually, I've been all right today. I went out and bought my son a bike, and I got a Have-A-Heart trap because we've got three foxes under the porch.''</i> 

Aerosmith's gig on the Esplanade on the Fourth of July with the Boston Pops was nixed. What went wrong? 

<i>``I'm extremely disappointed we can't do it. I thought it would be good. I went to the wall for this. I got all the music for `I Don't Want to Miss A Thing,' the whole thing for 114-piece orchestra. I went and absconded with that so they could use it. And we were going to do `Dream On.' 

`But when you look at what it required, it was a day of rehearsal and then the whole day of the show. We've been on the road for five months. What do I say when I look into my 14-year-old's eyes and she says, `Daddy, are you going to come to my graduation?' There's only so many days. That's the problem. There really was just no time. Maybe next year. I don't think Keith Lockhart's going to hold a grudge.''</i> 

The other big July event in Boston is the Democratic National Convention. Will Aerosmith get political? 

<i>``John (Kerry) and I are good friends. I speak to him a lot. Unfortunately, we're playing the night he's doing (the convention). He asked if we'd play it. I told him if he's elected president, on your inaugural, we'll play. Each guy (in Aerosmith) has got different opinions. I think all the presidents have a downfall. They try to do as much as they can egotistically. They say `for the people' and `of the people,' but it's not always that. It's for their own star. 

John Kerry's a different kind of guy. When you're talking to him, you feel you're talking to a guy who's had a lot of experience. He looks you square in the eye. He has a really strong belief system. I'm a big John Kerry fan. ... 

`But, hey, what a great blues album.''</i> 

Smooth transition, Steven. I was going to ask about `Honkin' On Bobo.' Would you say it's a tribute to both black American bluesmen and to the white British blues-rock bands that influenced Aerosmith when you were starting out? 

<i>``Yeah. We started out doing a minimalistic record. Then we stopped halfway through and said, `We have to put in a little bit more of what Aerosmith is today, as well as what we heard in the early days that got us off. Oh, man, `Lost Woman' by the Yardbirds. Just insane. It got us so high. It just tweaked our dots. Playing that stuff was our calling.''</i> 

You keep following that calling. Aerosmith's tour ends in Japan next month. Then what? 

<i>``I'm taking a year off. The band has never done that. We've taken a year off to do a record, but we're thinking of taking a year to do nothing. But I'm sure around the seventh, eighth month I'm going to call Joe (Perry) and say, `I'm going to lose my (expletive) mind. We gotta do something.' That's how it is. We've still go a lot of good music left in us.''</i>"

"event","<i>Hollywood Cryin' out for Boston Bad Boys
By Gayle Fee and Laura Raposa
Saturday, June 19, 2004</i>

The TweeterCenter will double as a 
Hollywood sound stage Thursday night when a film crew working on Elmore 
Leonard's ``Get Shorty'' sequel moves in to shoot Aerosmith's hometown throw-down 
as well as behind-the-scenes brouhaha. 

""And you know how backstage at an Aerosmith show can be quite an adventure,'' 
said band axman Joe Perry who, along with Steven Tyler, is brushing up on his 
lines while on tour this week. 

In ``Be Cool,'' John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, the 
Hollywood movie producer who has moved into the music biz. The set-up for the 
TweeterCenter gig is that Chili is trying to get Tyler and Perry to give his young 
client, Linda Moon, a look-see. 

""I don't know if Travolta or (his leading lady) Uma Thurman will be there, 
but we know the Linda Moon actress is coming because she'll sing `Cryin' ' on 
stage with Steven,'' the rocker said. 

""The hometown fans will really get to see how a movie is made because we may 
have to do the song a couple of times.'' 

Perry said the crew was supposed to film the concert scenes during another 
stop on the Bad Boys' ``Honkin' On Bobo'' tour. But after some scheduling 
snafus - including the cancellation of a few shows last week because of Tyler's 
testy throat - the Mansfield madness got the nod from Hollywood. 

Leonard, an Aerosmith fan from way back, wrote the band into his latest Chili 
Palmer saga. But the Boston rock 'n' rollers are no strangers to the movie 
biz - the boys played a big part in ``Wayne's World 2'' and both Tyler and Perry 
have acted in small indie flicks.

Friday, June 18, 2004 

By Ed Masley, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> 

<lj-cut text=""Honkin' On Bobo' commentary/preview"">

Advance word on ""Honkin' on Bobo"" had the bad boys from Boston reconnecting with their roots on a full-length tribute to the blues. 

As luck would have it, though, they couldn't stay the course, emerging from Joe Perry's basement instead with a spirited rock 'n' roll album of songs that often started as the blues (including tracks by Mississippi Fred McDowell and Willie Dixon) but couldn't resist the temptation of being transformed into classic Aerosmith, as raunchy and alive as Eric Clapton's ""Me and Mr. Johnson"" was reserved and reverent. 

Theirs feels more like ""Me and Dr. Johnson."" 

As Perry, the group's Keith Richards, explains, ""It was supposed to be, originally, kind of a side project. Here's Aerosmith doing their blues record, kind of like the Eric Clapton record. But I think there was just too much fire in us and also too much respect for the originals. I mean, we're not Stevie Ray Vaughan. We're not Jonny Lang. We're not Robert Cray. We're a rock band. 

""And it just felt more appropriate to do a record that was us interpreting how blues made us feel, as opposed to doing a so-called traditional blues record. That's probably why it took us so long to get around to it. Every time we really thought about 'Well, are we gonna go in there and just copy the Muddy Waters version of ""I'm Ready""?' What's the point in that? Even though theoretically it sounded like a fun project, when it came down to it, it didn't appeal to us."" 

Perry credits a new generation of blues-inspired rock acts, from the White Stripes to the Porch Ghouls (a band that records on his label), with making the idea more appealing, which got him thinking about what Aerosmith had done with old classics like ""Walking the Dog"" and ""Train Kept A-Rollin',"" long before the band's Hall of Fame induction. 

And that's when ""it started to gel for me,"" he says. ""So I was the one that just said, 'OK, we can do this. We've just gotta get down in the room and start playing.' "" 

Recorded with ""Toys in the Attic"" producer Jack Douglas, ""Honkin' on Bobo"" finds Aerosmith tearing it up in true Aerosmith fashion on everything from ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and ""Shame Shame Shame"" to one Aerosmith original, ""The Grind,"" to a ballad destined to forever be associated with the great Aretha Franklin, ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)."" 

While hits like ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" have kept the band name in the spotlight, this is the side of the band that fans who came of age (or spent their first night getting naked in the backseat) to such classic releases as ""Toys in the Attic"" and ""Rocks"" have been clamoring for, the raunchy blues-inspired rock 'n' roll on which the legend ultimately rests. 

If it feels like the guys have taken a trip back in time to their '70s heyday, Perry says it has a lot to do with their having recorded the songs as live as possible. 

""The early records, the first two or three, were done playing live in the studio and basically going for takes ... as opposed to knowing you're gonna redo your track or go back and put your leads on and all that stuff, which is kind of what we did most of the time after the first couple of records. It's just a different mind-set of recording. And that ties into what this band does best is play live and create excitement. When we were sitting in the audience watching bands play in our early years, it was all about the excitement of seeing the band play and watching these bands put on a great rock 'n' roll show. So trying to capture that has been the goal."" 

But over time, he says, it's easy to lose sight of that ""because you can technically just get better and better at playing and making records, and you can lose sight of that one element of the energy of the band playing live. So in that sense, we did reconnect with it, but that's something we do every night, too. So you could say it's more a connection to the side of the band where we live the most -- playing live."" 

Another key ingredient in capturing the energy of playing live was putting a time limit on the recording. 

""If you only get so much time, you can only do so many takes,"" he says. ""We also recorded it in such a way that there was so much leakage into everybody else's microphones that it wasn't really possible to redo my guitar part because it was all over the drum tracks and the drums were bleeding into the guitar tracks and the vocals were picking up everything. So everybody's performance had to be as good as it could be on that take .... And that's how we recorded it back in the old days, 'cause you really didn't have that many tracks to fool with anyway."" 

Despite the clear retreat the album would appear to represent from the radio-courting ways of Diane Warren's ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" and ""Jaded"" (which earned the band the distinction of being the only group in history to be inducted to the Hall of Fame and score a Top 10 single in the same year), the album hit the charts at No. 5 and was certified gold in less than two months on the charts, while rock radio jumped all over ""Baby Please Don't Go."" 

""I'm overwhelmed with the response it's gotten and how hungry people were for this,"" Perry says. ""I think most people know that that's what this band is about because of the live shows and it hasn't been on the records for so long. And it's certainly going to point a direction for the next recordings we do, whenever that happens."" 

Not that this means no more courting radio with songs like ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" 

""I think that everybody's really excited about the response and the acclaim,"" Perry says, ""but I think we still want to get singles on the radio, and, obviously, it's gonna be a balance of retaining some of the rawness and earthiness that obviously everybody likes to hear with, you know, more radio Top 40 things. Everybody's so quick to put us down for doing songs like 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.' It's amazing the bull---- people lay on us for doing that song, but meanwhile it was our only No. 1 single. And then, in the same breath, they go, 'How do you guys do it? How come you're still relevant?' Well ... it's because we have [expletive] singles. And we've gone out and had pop songs on our records. It's not because of some [expletive] magic trick that you're interviewing me today. We've had the 'I Don't Want to Miss a Things' and the 'Angels' and the 'Dream Ons' that have made it on Top 40 radio and gotten that kind of audience that likes pop music. But we also have that roaring undercurrent of hard rock/garage bandness to us. So it's kind of ironic that people don't see that. It's almost like they don't want to acknowledge that those songs are big songs because they're what people want to hear. It's not because we're foisting it on anybody. That's just what it takes to get on Top 40 radio."" 

And he's not just defending Aerosmith. He seems to genuinely care about the way its cover of the Warren song has made her a target. 

""It's a good song,"" he says. ""It's a really good song. It's well-written, the lyrics are really sensitive, and Diane Warren happens to be a great songwriter. It's really easy to be cynical about it but she writes what people want to hear. She's doing nothing else but entertaining an audience, you know? And that's all we are is entertainers."" 

Steven Tyler is the one who's always stressing the importance of hit singles, and it's been suggested that he had his reservations going into this recording. 

""He's totally right,"" says Perry of Tyler's views on singles, ""because that's what's kept us on the top of the wave instead of just being another 30-year-old band, their best work being their first three records. That kind of thinking is what's kept us where we are. I totally agree with him on that. So there was always the risk of doing a record like this and then the distance between the last single and the potential next single being so far apart that it would be harder for us to climb back on. ... But my feeling is that Aerosmith has been around too long and we're too much of an established thing. We've done just about every [expletive] up thing that we can do to [expletive] up our careers and we've done a lot of great things to further our careers. ... He had his doubts about it, but he loved doing the record and I think he really loves the thing because this is, you know, where we all live, playing live and rocking out. He's the first one to come in and say 'Let's play a whole set of ""Mama Kin"" and ""Same Old Song and Dance."" ' He definitely is not jumping up and down saying, 'We have to play ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" ' "" 

They tend to do it, though. 

""We do,"" he says. ""We vary that with other ones. We'll do 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.' We always do 'Dream On.' We do 'What It Takes.' We'll do 'Crying.' Sometimes we do 'Crazy.' We play the hits. It's what the fans wanna hear."" 

A recent Blender story pointed out that Perry didn't like ""Dream On,"" the band's first Top 10 single, when Tyler brought it in. 

All true, he says. 

""I thought it was an OK song, but it was too slow,"" Perry says of ""Dream On,"" a track from Aerosmith's 1973 debut that hit the charts when it was re-released in 1976. ""I didn't like slow songs. I'm an energy guy. I love rock. I love power. I just figured the only good slow song was a slow blues."" 

But it's part of the game, he says. ""I figured 'Well, if that song gets on the radio, a lot of people are gonna hear it and buy the record and hear all the rest of what Aerosmith is.' But I have a lot more respect for that song now than I did then. It's brilliant. It's an incredible song. Steven wrote it back when we had nothing, and it was all about him and his dream and sometimes I think that's when some artists' best work happens, when they're desperate and they have nothing to lose. Look at Kerouac. He wrote all of his best stuff before he had his first big break. Or a lot of his best stuff. When he was poor and down and out and struggling to find himself."" 

Being a self-confessed ""energy guy,"" you'd think it was safe to assume, then, that Perry was pushing for rockers on ""Honkin' on Bobo,"" but he's the one who suggested the Franklin cover, a soul ballad. 

""I know [Steven's] a really big Janis Joplin fan,"" he says. ""I think he's probably used her as more of a role model vocally than probably anybody else. So I thought that it would be cool to do one of those R&B-type of songs. I was thinking about Etta James. There's one she does, 'I'd Rather Go Blind,' that was kind of on my A-list. But I was listening to an Aretha Franklin record, and I heard 'I've Never Loved a Man.' And I thought that would be just really cool, that he could wrap his gender-bender thing around that. So I brought that one down to the basement, and he said, 'Oh, yeah, that would be a good one.' "" 

And a risky one. 

""Well, it's definitely a risk,"" he says. ""So much of our music, and your music and everybody's music, that we love, is performance. If you saw that song on sheet music, you'd go, 'What the [expletive] is this?' It's nothing. It's just a flat bunch of notes. It's all about the playing and interpretation. When a song is interpreted by someone as great as Aretha Franklin, it's really risky going in there and trying to cover it. It's like trying to cover a Beatles song. Unless you can give it something without taking away from the song. It was risky. But I had faith that Steven could pull it off. 'Cause I think he's as good a singer as she is."" 

There were other songs they tried, as you may have imagined, that didn't end up on the record. 

""I think the first bunch of songs, we were kind of just experimenting,"" Perry says. ""And I think that once the ball was rolling and everybody was into the thing and realizing that we have something going, then the shift started to happen and we started picking different songs. I think 'Baby Please Don't Go' was one of the songs that unified the whole thing and we realized, wow, this is going to be beyond a blues record. This is gonna be a [expletive] killer Aerosmith record."" 

Despite a killer version of Blind Willie McTell's ""Broke Down Engine"" that wasn't finished in time, Perry doesn't see a ""Vol. 2"" on the horizon. 

""I think what we'll do is just include bits and pieces of covers,"" he says. ""I mean, the Stones have been doing it for years. A lot of people do it. And I think we'll just do more of it because there's just too many great songs out there."" 

They'll be adding a few of their own, of course. In fact, if there'd been time, he says, ""The Grind"" would have been one of as many as four or five new originals on this one. 

""If we had another two months to finish the record, this album would have been a lot different,"" Perry says. ""There would have been more originals on it and you wouldn't have noticed the difference as far as 'Oh, this is an old blues song' or 'This is an Aerosmith song.' They all would have fit together."""

By Steve Morse, Globe Staff  |  June 18, 2004</i>

Aerosmith is in a ""holding pattern,"" says guitarist Joe Perry, after just canceling three shows because Steven Tyler blew out his voice. The band hopes to resume its tour tonight in Pittsburgh, then next Thursday play the Tweeter Center with Cheap Trick. ""It's a miracle how Steven does what he does,"" says Perry. ""There's not many people who can sing like he can and put out and deliver every night. He doesn't hold anything back. But the voice is a piece of fragile equipment.""

The latest Aerosmith tour is in support of new album ""Honkin' on Bobo,"" which contains some blues classicsdone Aerosmith-style. ""We made a party record using the blues,"" says Perry, the album's primary architect, who sifted through 
""hundreds of songs"" before the group settled on the ones to cover. ""We needed to do this record,"" Perry adds. ""We needed to be all in the same [studio] room playing again.""

The album came out with a raw edge, but Perry had to work hard to keep it that way. ""About three-fourths of the way through it, we had a fight over keeping it raw or not,"" he says. ""There were times when I had to walk out of the room. But I'm like a freight train when I'm committed to something.""

The band did a mini-blues set during last summer's tour and is now performing six to seven of the ""Honkin' on Bobo"" tracks each night, scattered throughout the set. ""They're going over really well,"" says Perry. ""Obviously, nothing goes over as well as `Dream On' or `Sweet Emotion,' but we were all surprised at 
how well everything is fitting together.""

Note: It (obviously) does not mention Hershey or Jones Beach, but, then again, it is a Boston paper, so perhaps that's an oversight on their part. I hope so."

"event","Aerosmith has canceled several U.S. concert dates due to frontman Steven Tyler's recurring throat problems, MTV.com reported Thursday. 

The legendary rock band is touring North America with fellow rockers Cheap Trick, but had to cancel four shows in the past two weeks.Only one make-up show has been added so far. 

But the show is still expected to go on Friday in Burgettstown, Pa., after which the band plans to perform its last five scheduled concerts. 

The group is also expected to play an additional concert on June 30 in Pelham, Ala., to replace the group's June 6 concert, which was the first show canceled, MTV.com said. 

Aerosmith kicked off the tour to support their blues album, ""Honkin' on Bobo,"" on March 11 in Lubbock, Texas."

Frontman Steven Tyler's recurring throat problems are <i>impairing</i> Aerosmith's hopes of ending their tour with '70s pop rockers Cheap Trick with a bang. 

The Boston veterans have canceled four shows in the past two weeks, and so far have only added one make-up show. 

<i>Aerosmith are still scheduled to play Friday in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania</i>, after which the band <i>plans to perform its last five original gigs of the North American tour, plus an additional concert on June 30 in Pelham, Alabama</i>. That show replaces the group's June 6 concert, which was the first show scrapped. 

The other canceled dates were June 12 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, June 14 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and June 16 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Aerosmith launched the tour to support their blues album, Honkin' on Bobo, on March 11 in Lubbock, Texas. 

The group has been on the road with great regularity since 2001, when it released Just Push Play, its most recent disc of original material. In November of that year, Tyler suffered a similar throat condition, causing Aerosmith to postpone a handful of gigs .

Hopefully, Steven's voice will improve, and  the tour will resume in Pittsburgh Friday night and continue, to end in the U.S. on the 30th in Birmingham/Pelham.

This growing up and looking for a job thing is making me crazy. I'm scared shitless. I could possibly be moving to another state with no friends, no where to live and more importantly no money. And I realized I am supposed to mail some forms to the NYPD by Friday that have to be notarized and typed...(not filled in with black ink). Maybe I'm stalling for a reason? I want the job so bad but I don't know if I'm ready. Maybe I'll feel ready when I only have the job to concentrate on. I don't want to grow up. I don't want to find new crazy roomies. I don't want to live in a cockroach infested apartment. I'm so confused. But I got a 93 on my russian theatre paper. And totally off the subject but I got lost in DC and didn't make it to Angela's bday party at FUR. :( I feel so bad and she's being so nice about it. Yell at me Angela! I love you but yell at me. I know you and I know it's not my fault but it would make me feel better. :) 

I need to start working out again.
Well I'm going to study, I have a test tomorrow about Putin. Should do pretty well on it."

""In toppling Connecticut, the team most college basketball analysts predicted would win it all, George Mason became only the second team with a double-digit seed to advance to the Final Four, following Louisiana State, also an 11th seed, in 1986. The Patriots also became the first team to defeat the two previous national champions -- Connecticut and North Carolina -- en route to the tournament's final weekend. All of this would have been a stunning achievement for a basketball powerhouse, but it defied description for an undersized, overlooked squad from a school that had never won an NCAA tournament game until 10 days ago."" - Washington Post 27 March 2006"

And by being such and dedicating my time to bullshit (i.e. sleep) I have officially screwed myself. Procrastination may feel good in the beginning but in the end you end up only fucking yourself. In the past two months I've gotten a shovel and created what is now known as my own personal hell hole. I'm surrounded in darkness, which is nothing new, and desperately pulling at minature roots I know don't exist, clawing my way to the top, only to realize that the sides of my hole is covered in motor oil, squelching my chances of actually getting out any time soon.

I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste 
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase 
You're the one I wanna hold
I wont let another minute go to waste 
I want you and your beautiful soul

I know that you are something special 
To you I'd be always faithful
I want to be what you always needed 
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me 

Am I crazy for wanting you
Baby do you think you could want me too 
I don't wanna waste your time


I haven't talked to my best friend in a long time. I mean really sat down and had a heart to heart. I can't wait til we have break, maybe we can finally see each other, even if its only for a day or something. 
""I would walk with you
as far as you would walk with me
Maybe we will sail away
on this darkened but shining sea

There are times when we are far away
in life and experience, all that we say
But I think of you, and I smile

Hurt and scarred by the things they say
but always know, in your deepest
haunted and darkened days
That I would walk with you
as far as you would walk with me
Then think of me, and smile

Lives apart we will be for this time
but inside of you, keep this all the while
An honest expression of feelings
As true and pure as anything

In your lonely solitude
Yeah, you might be in your lonely solitude
but you are there with me
and you can think of us, and smile

Smile because this gift of
unconditional love I give to you
We have proved it a thousand times before
Lay back and fall into this
surrender your exhausted soul
to the welcome and patient hand
of unexpected love""
:written by the best person in the world who will always be in my heart wherever I am. I look to you for guidance, support, and above all friendship:  -Don't surrender to being ordinary because you are capable of something so much greater-"

I've been thinking a lot about this quote that I got from my friend: ""I've seen enough to eye you, but I've seen too much to try you.""  I guess there are a couple ppl this applies to in my life right now. You start out liking someone, maybe it could go somewhere, and then you find out some things or see some things that aren't what you're looking for in a person/relationship.  It's kind of sad b/c you know you're good enough for them and would treat them right.

""The road to finding 'the one' is paved with a bit of promiscuity""
""Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should just be friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.""

And I guess I'll write one or two nice quotes about love b/c I have been in love and it really is the best feeling in the world.

""Love, in all its fragile forms, is the one powerful, enduring force that brings real meaning to our everyday lives...but the love i mean is the fire that burns inside us all, the inner warmth that prevents our soul from freezing in the winters of despair.""

""A good love is delicious, you can't get enough too soon, it makes you so crazy you want to swallow the moon"""

Now a few of my favorite lines from Earnest Hemingway since I'm feeling somewhat inspired and joyful:
A Moveable Feast:
There you could always go into the Luxembourg museum and all the paintings were sharpened and clearer and more beautiful if you were belly-empty, hollow-hungry. I learned to understand Cezanne much better and to see truly how he made landscapes when I was hungry. I used to wonder if he were hungry too when he painted; but I thought possibly it was only that he forgot to eat. It was one of those unsound but illuminating thoughts you have when you have been sleepless or hungry. Later I thought Cezanne was probably hungry in a different way.

I watched Lewis carefully without seeming to look at him, as you do when you are boxing, and I do not think I had ever seen a nastier-looking man. Some people show evil as a great race horse shows breeding. They have the dignity of a hard chancre. Lewis did not show evil; he just looked nasty. Walking home I tried to think what he reminded me of and there were various things. They were all medical except toe-jam and that was a slang word. I tried to break his face down and describe it but I could only get the eyes. Under the black hat, when I had first seen them, the eyes had been those of an unsuccessful rapist.

I knew everything was all right and was going to turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, ""Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater than Jesus?"" Nobody thought anything of it at the time. It was only Zelda's secret that she shared with me, as a hawk might share something with a man. But hawks do not share. Scott did not write anything any more that was good until after he knew that she was insane.

When I saw my wife again standing by the tracks as the train came in by the piled logs at the station, I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her.

There is never any ending to Paris and the memory of each person who has lived in it differs from that of any other. We always returned to it no matter who we were or how it was changed or with what difficulties, or ease, it could be reached. Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it. But this is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy."

""Breaking The Habit""

Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

I dont want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends"

"event","Ok, more craziness today.  I go to the gym and for some reason I feel like going up in weight, not maxing out per se but a fairly large increase in weight without hurting myself. I usually leg press 180 cuz I'm just trying to stay toned,,,yada yada yada,,,long story short I end up lifting 270. Craziness!! 

Anyway, I can't wait to go back to school. I'm not sure if it's to start classes or to see my friends...I know what you're all thinking...yeah Jen, that's a tough one!

OOOOOOOO guess what?! The Opera Verdi Europa is performing Carmen at school. Yay!!  And the Virginia Opera is performing Faust in April...I can't wait!!! (You might only be able to appreciate Faust if you were in Russian Lit class with me) unless you know the story, in which case, I love you!  And the Magic Flute is playing at the Kennedy Center this summer - my favorite opera ever!

Ok I think I used too many exclamation points in this but it was well worth it!!! --Those were just for good measure :) Uh oh, gotta go, L&O:SVU is on"

"event","Ok, so, I signed up for this livejournal thing as you can see. Hopefully this will be a good emotional outlet for me with everything that is going on in my life. Plus it's faster and easier than writing. Gotta love technology. 

I guess I'll just jump right in. Jeff left to go back to Florida today. I'm sad about that and missing him already. I still have two and a half weeks of this crap; before I go back to school and all. I'm so bored at home, and it's not like I don't have stuff to do, b/c my friends want me to hang out with them all the time, but sometimes I just don't feel like going through all the effort of pleasing ppl. I don't feel like anyone understands me except for Jeff and Sam. Maybe a few other ppl at school. (p.s. Sam you're awesome and we totally rock!!) 

I really think I have ADD b/c I was onto something right then and now I don't want to talk/type about it anymore. You'll find that a lot as you read through my entries when I have more. Total randomness! I love it! 

So I need to give blood sometime next week so I can find out my blood type. I just hope I don't pass out. 

I think this first entry went well. I don't know how to end things like this so peace out and don't choke on a chicken bone!"

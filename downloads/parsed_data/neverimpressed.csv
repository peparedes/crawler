"event","I haven't written anything in here since I got back from Penn state which was 2-3 weeks ago I guess you can say? It was good times. I actually enjoyed being away from everything. I noticed that the smallest things piss me off and for good reasons not crap reasons. <br /><br />There's been a lot of talk happening since I've been gone. Which I expected because all these random questions and what-nots kept popping up when I got back. To have a lot of questions there needs to be a lot of information coming from either one place or various places. I'll give off a list of things.<br /><b><br />1. Certain member being relieved of Dead City Promo/Doing all the work<br />2. Feeling like Third wheel to a certain couple<br />3. Hating everyone around me<br />4. Shows</b><br /><br />I'll start off slowly with each topic and then maybe we can straighten everything out:<br /><br /><b>1. <u>Certain member being relieved of Dead City Promo</u></b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't see a name there it either means the person left or there is just no way we want him/her in there. I'm not saying we kicked the person out because we didn't want them in there. They just weren't pulling their own weight and other things that reflected on other individuals of the group. If people want to constantly ask if they can join the answer is NO. Don't sweet talk me because I look like I give in easily to everything. Technically I just don't care and I'm content where I am. If you think that I am nodding and smiling to tell you that you have a good chance. Chances are you have no chance at all.&nbsp; Good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sad to see the person go. They did well when I was around and never did shit to bug too much. There are supposed to be kinks and knots involved and&nbsp; mistakes are supposed to happen before everything runs appropriately. <br /><br />Then there is the issue of everyone complaining about doing all the work. A person can only do all the work if they choose to. No doubt. Others are usually always willing to help stuff like that. <br /><br /><b>2. <u>Feeling like Third wheel to a certain couple<br /><br /></u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People need to understand this. EVERYONE FEELS LIKE IT. Do you expect me to just sit around and pretend like its cool? No, I'll make a face if I want to its not like you can stop me from doing so. Everyone keeps talking about it like its some big deal. If I don't feel like hanging out with you then I don't want to hang out? Get over it...I'm really tired of people getting all crazy about a situation that is really not even important in my eyes anyhow.<br /><br /><b>3. <u>Hating everyone around me<br /><br /></u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So maybe I've become a jerk in the past couple of months. Technically I don't care, I don't hate everyone...I just want my peace and quiet and I'm growing up...I'm out of that kid phase where I have to be happy all the time and pretend like I'm fucking happy. If I'm not I'm not going to suck it up and smile. Eff that shit. If you've got a problem let me know. I can probably solve it by telling you to shut the fuck up. I enjoy the friends I've got no doubt. But I kind of want some new ones to put on my wall. Haha not on the wall literally but you know just so I have a separate way of doing things and so I can also just relax when I want to and not do the same things over again. Yer...<br /><br /><b>4. <u>Shows<br /><br /></u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Way too many shows. But oh well. They will get done. Hopefully they will all do well though. <br /><br /><br />If there is anything else I need to add here. I probably will don't fret."

"event","Got to love the fact that the debates are going on.
I find them quite intriguing even if I'm not American.
The issues brought up by the DEM voters in New Hamp 
were pretty chill.


On a more serious note about my life and what I keep thinking about every day. 
I found that I feel old. I keep thinking up theories on how to fix certain things
such as poverty, debt etc you know? Then I think about how come 
I haven't been able to get my ass out of Ottawa. I had the chance when trying to choose a university 
but I didn't take it. Why do you think? Because I was to afraid to uproot my whole life.

Uprooting my whole life means
-new friends
-fresh start
-no help from parents

I love the idea of a fresh start and ive wanted it for the past year.
But maybe its best when I'm on my way towards 21-22. 
I'll be done school by then which is fantastic.

I need some kind of PUSH to get me there.
Or some kind of defining moment to show 
I should move some place else.

Here are my choices:
New York
California
BC
Halifax
Montreal
Somewhere in Delaware or Massach.

This is just what I've been thinking for too long. 
Funny huh?

But yeah. I just want to do stupid shit to make my parents happy
and then to get out of everything as fast as I can.
The parents deserve that much..........................


Or maybe If I meet someone who actually wants to move with me.
That way I'm moving with someone I really really like. (Yes I mean a boy you hag-tags)"

"event","Wow,

I really noticed how lonely I am. Like I understand how everyone's got their significant other or their booty calls.
It's grand for them no doubt. I think I don't even try or look and then something comes along but its usually a big mistake
because they aren't near enough to trust. I really..really want change. I love Ottawa and everything but now that I'm in Pennsylvania for 
3 weeks. I enjoy not knowing anyone and being able to start over. I've wanted to move for a while but its hard to decide specially when my parents are paying for school and that whole super strict facto that's involved. Like I don't mind moving out in Ottawa...i know I am free to do that in September. BUT Maybe finding a new city would be nice.

I'm not saying I want to move because I'm lonely.
I want to move because I'm fed up of having to put up with everyones bullshit towards each other.

I know pretty much everyones secrets.
Yeah that's right...just me
It's depressing...I wish everyone was more than likely open.

I can be.
I love everyone 
things bug me though

-selfishness
-they enjoy using me because I dont say a word
-im ""just ro""
-if i dont like something dont force it on me
-dont ask me for my things when im broke (smokes,food,etc)
-dont think i am an idiot. I may pretend to be like one but it just means I'm planning on taking you out in the end (surprised? should be)
-dont think other girls are sluts when you dress the exact same way..honestly it makes no difference
-stop gloating about what you got because frankly when i sound excited it just means i really dont care

ugh.
Im going to save up as much money as I can...
maybe get out of this town next summer 
then try a college for what I actually want to do
or start over?

People don't change.
I know how my friends are now.

The Apartment pretty much showed it.
Everyone came over all the time 
always using it as a getaway place.

Leave their shit at my place because they knew they'd come back.
Constantly going around and touching my shit.
If it was someone elses house you'd be fucking courteous. NO JOKE

I miss my friends now that I am away yes.
But I can also live without...

gah.

help?
I'm also not going to go searching for the next arm candy..
they can find me. 

bleh.
save me?"

Also watching Americanized television and occasionally on the computer if I can find a solid connection. Which I am sure there will be one. Hopefully...<br /><br />I will be back the 19th of June and I hope things will have changed in Ottawa for the better. More understanding with people and maybe...JUST MAYBE...Things will turn up for me so I don't have to constantly bug friends to hang out although I am fine doing things on my own and what not I just get bored and shit. I'll figure that stuff out when I get back though. <br /><br />I'm going to miss specific people. Katrina, Baker since I see him often now and his jokes crack me up even if he is making fun of me...Anna..Michelle a little bit but not so much. I've hung out with her so long that it's not like I'm missing out on anything. Vicky I will miss and John OH OH and Chris Fairbairns because I saw him with the pickle wristlings now. I still don't know why he got that in the first place. <br /><br />New people?! <br />Yes I met new people. This one chick name laureen who seems like a nice person to hang out with. She lives in Kitchener though and was only in Ottawa to check out the Universities and see if she wanted to move. She seemed like a new friend I could hang out with.<br /><br />Then I met Eric randomly on Wednesday when he was with Chris. Super cute dude. He already knows...thanks to Chris.&nbsp; But meh whatever. Seems like a nice person.<br /><br />Then last but not least I met Chaz (Charles) one of my cousins who drove down with my dad and then went his own way but only came by to say hi to the family. Haven't seen him since he was young although he is 2 years older we were still kids when we used to punch each other. Was fun stuff . <br /><br /><br />There's not much else to put into this journal.<br />I'm not going to update it like everyday..But I will when I can.<br />ALSO!!!

"event","There is never a better time to be happy and what you do when you have alot of kids who are happy that a certain band came around and the band that is from out of town have been amazing guys. I'm glad with this whole Dead City Promo thing. I had a bit of doubts just because of the way we would all bump heads but im glad its been quite amazing for the most part.

I hope I get a chance to meet all these dudes again since not one time did they disapoint my standage on what I do once in a while.

- I also moved back in with my parents which will be hell because its their house and their rules which I cannot stand whatsoever. 
Which means I will have to conform to their ways and what not. I'm not complaining at all because it means I ave a roof over my head but I don't think i will be able to put up with them unless somethings change..actually a lot of things change. 

I've been trying to cope with alot of shit. 
My week has been an emotional roller coaster. 

I got stood up on Saturday from a nice dude WHO i thought actually stopped being a jerk.
Then Sunday night another guy came buy and he actually asked to hangout and watch a movie...although he was pretty nice all together during the night which made me feel a bit better about the male race so hoorah! I wasn't in the best mood so I felt a bit bad but it could not be helped. 
Monday had an exam that I didn't care about. From there its been a big I don't really care about much and I won't be able to do the things I'd like to do with my life because of my parents..they support me financially and influence me quite a bit. I don't want to have one of those falling outs with them either because that's just stupid and I still care about them even if they are on the extreme side. 

I need some good news.
I hate getting stupid mood swings
and feeling repetitive about my problems
Not everyone is the same but whatever...

"event","I know I haven't written in this thing for a long time. I realize that much..
It's been a hectic month. Not to mention the people I've met have shown me a couple things about live,trust,pathetic-ness and then terror.

I've got my best friend who is dating a friend of mine. Which is pretty cool...I just feel like the third wheel which is pretty understandable. I realize that I should probably stop hanging out with them so much. Get away on my own and just have my own alone time or stop hanging around people period would probably make me a more calm person and probably less reliable to hangout with others...

I'm over the people who impacted my life. I also realize that I have nothing to look forward to. School sure..that's grand but I'm not doing exactly what I would like to do. It's a fun and all but not something i'm completely interested in.&nbsp; Whatever though shit happens. If my parents decide to not pay for me to go to college then whatever...

Most of this shit is really stupid. I kind of dislike being in Ottawa although I've said it time and time again. But its not like I can leave anyway I'm too addicted to this town...

I have a date tomorrow well technically today. At least I think I have a date tonight. I couldn't call so I had to text him up which sucks. 
My plan changed today so I can call whoever I want when I want. I used all my minutes up yesterday morning. Bleh, curse my mother calling me every 10 minutes to figure out where I live.

Anyway this is a randomly drunk rant. 
Not that I am proud of it but what the hell else am I going to do.

good night."

"event","I haven't been up to much I admit...I finish school on Tuesday which is grand but then again I couldn't care less right now about how my education is going especially since its not what I want to do with my life. I recently just joined forces with a couple of friends who so happen to be promoters. It's grand. Except for the fact that we started at a time where more than 3/4 doesn't have a job. Which isn't that bad...but we don't have a lot of shows. Actually that's a lie we have 7-8 shows in May. Plus a couple more happening in the next few months. All of us will be on tour as well 3 months. With Her Train of Stars, The Matthewboyle Experience, Ellison, Sam Slick Karate Highschool and Elbowdrop Sundays.

Katrina is doing TME Tour
Michelle is working the Her Train,Sam Slick Elbowdrop Tour
Then I am going at the Ellison, Karate Highschool and Elbowdrop Sundays Tour

We should be all having a grand ol' time honestly. I'm quite excited about touring this summer. Gives me sometime away from Ottawa to relax and then come back and enjoy it again rather then hating the life out of it. I guess that's pretty much how its going. There's alot of tension built up or whatever people call it. 

I also cut my hair as well. Well Anna one of my good friends did it for me Easter Monday which I am quite happy about. It looks alright I will probably get use to it soon enough who knows? 


I was thinking about listing a bunch of shit that has been bugging me lately but there's really not enough time I would probably have to do it. 


I randomly got asked a while ago to go on those wacky dates. 
didn't work out too well...didn't speak the whole time we had coffee.
I cant stand that w..the whole having to force conversation.
It was this guy from school though and I didn't bother to tell any of my friends only because it had to of been the worst thing I have ever...gah
actually I felt bad but the coffee was good..

Another one that stunk was having to go to a movie and sit in the theatre not feel well at all and watch a random movie on the other end of the city. It wasn't that bad since I think that's the most the person has talked in a while..but he was a looker. 

I'm actually just trying to say that a change of scenery and maybe a different shade of guys who can speak would be nice.


Not to mention people who aren't so self-absorbed or annoying.
thats all I ask.

thats all i have to write.

"event","I enjoy the fact that...I contemplate many things from time to time and can not always express certain things with people or open up or act the way people wish I would.&nbsp; I've had an awkward and emotional Saturday - Sunday week. Not only did I act upon a couple of hunches..but I have been a complete bitch the whole week and still a fun type of person I used to be in high school. I've been used, abused and thrown around and I hate that. I used to be able to just let it go right through me and not say a word...and now I continuously burst out at random times when shit is pissing me off.&nbsp; 

Tuesday I had a chiller interview at the Second cup in Bayshore it was good I think it went well they said they would contact me in a week so I still have some time to wait as well. Thursday had a show at saw and that was fun..draining a bit but fun I went to lebop and hated it...I actually hate going to that place..It's not the fact that I have to always go up and down. I spend money to get wasted which is pathetic...I also want to try and quit smoking NOT TO MENTION THE GRIME that lives on the walls and walk on the floors. Which is why I've decided to stop drinking and clubbing for a month and if I can go on more than that then I will keep on doing so...

I've been having little bits of squabbles with friends and now that I do have an apartment I understand that it is easier for everyone just to come here and lounge out until a certain time then leave...I can tell when I look at them. Yes I invite some people to come by and stay the night but for them to assume before they get there eh I don't know. My food is gone. People don't ask if we can share food. Really that's chiller...

I've been also thinking about moving to the states and going to a College there or in another city in Canada. I also thought about moving to Europe but realized that it might be too&nbsp; expensive...okay might be? no it will be. 

I know im 18 but I feel a bit older...
it has nothing to do with living on my own.
It is just the problems i've faced in the past
and other shit.

I know I usually have about 9 blogs that I start and never finish mainly because I have different things that go on in my life. But I am pretty sure i will keep this one. I just don't enjoy deleting friends or telling people that I sometimes don't give two shits what they think...<br /><br /><br />If you are going to complain on how I continuously change my mind on my thoughts then save it because as I stated before i don't exactly care. <br /><br /><b><br />Now to recap my weekend:<br /><br />Friday </b>was good, I don't usually understand the point of house parties at times..I've had one and it was good but I think that's because everyone was talking and not trying to get into someone's pants like every other party. Well at least not everyone.&nbsp; I went to Twiggy's [HTOS] he's a pretty chiller dude no doubt. But I did feel quite old when I was there. The oldest people were Eric,Jordan,Anna,Zack and I. It's grand but they all had their significant others so it was pretty much just Anna and I who were playing Nintendo and taking photos of everyone and also going around the house a bunch. At the end I threw everyones shoes in the snow just to be a bit childish and have my say. But also someone threw Anna's shoes in the snow or filled them up with snow. gargle.<br /><br /><br /><b>Saturday</b> was interesting...I headed over to Orleans to check out the new stores: Boathouse, Urban Behaviour and Costa Blanca. <br />Boathouse was okay except for the fact that it's very bright and the people that work there enjoy following you non-stop its creepy. I also bought new osiris kicks for 20$ which im quite happy about and then headed back home. I live downtown at the moment as well. Then got back took one of those showers and stayed in my bathrobe for more than 2 hours which is pretty lazy of me but oh well. Zack was having a party and we had to go pick Sean up from Barrhaven which took us a bit of time since we got lost and went to bumfuck nowhere and found a random gazebo..Anna pointed it out and we also saw some alien facility centre. Not really alien but you know..those random plants for cow feeding or milking or something. The boonies.&nbsp; So we ended up turning back and finally caught up to pick him up. Got to Zacks and started drinking. The night was fun..awkward morning but fun night I guess. Random music from myspace every 10 minutes. I got extremely trashed well semi-trashed and started crashing a bit which isn't cool. Also wore a skirt for the first time....crazy huh? Then watched final destination with Anna and fell asleep on the floor with Sean since we got shafted from every possible couch there was. I also smacked my hand on the cement causing it to bleed. Bleeding is not fun at all...<br /><br /><br />I've had time to contemplate about certain things. I live on my own and I'm not to confident about the future anymore. Although I am confident myself. I know when to say no and I also know what I want. There's a few things I'd like to have in my life...good education, healthy lifestyle, confident guy..not one night stands I hate being one of those things that guys lust after for a bit..get a piece then move on its disgusting. If you are going to do something then fucking stick with it...don't jump from crater to crater because its fun for you.&nbsp; UGH <br /><br /><br />Also I wish people would be straight up with me..that's really all I ask if you want to smile at me down the street and act like you actually enjoy my company then go for it but I will sniff the fear...its just how I am. I can't stand crotch rot and I can't stand people who can't take NO As and answer its definately uncomfortable and I hate being uncomfortable. <br /><br /><br />This definately conlcudes my first journal post. I might just list a bunch of things that happen and photos. The usual deal.<br /><br /><br />cheers xo.<br /><b><br /><br /></b></div>"

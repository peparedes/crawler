"event","well,its been a long while since i have dedicated myself to this.things have been pretty hectic with school,and work and the fact that i have a social life now.the title is fitting because sean's official last day at work is today and we are getting drunk friday nite.hes my boss,but i really dont care this time.key points:
NIN was awesome.anthony and i had an excellent time,considering we got lost for about 30 minutes.school is going ok.there is this one class that i always end up skipping,yet im doing fairly well.i dont ever talk to rob since that nite last week where he asked me to have sex with him the next day because he and his girlfriend were on the outs.i have had this massive crush on the guy up the street for a long time and we have been talking since mayso we finally hung out the other nite and he was the sweetest piece of man ive ever seen.my getting home at 4 am this morning can be attributed to the new gentleman that  i work with.ive always found him attractive but just recently told him.he waited until i got off of work and then we drove around in the city,went to a sex shop and parked the car.i told him i liked him and we were kind of holding hands and we ended up kissing for about 20 mins,which is nice because ive never had anyone be that nice before.BAHHHHHH.and hes black,nukkas.that is all for now .....i may have earth shattering news soon.depends..

"event","ah,anyway,im in the throes about not going to college at a university,and im having money issues.spending more than i have can get you in a bit of trouble.ive also gotten charge cards for jewelery stores so for christmas,everyone is getting bling.hmm...im off of work all this week and i have taken it upon myself to do pretty much nothing.ive done my nails,exfoliated,been on a date,gotten some sweet love....honestly,..it had been a long time and i really wasnt looking forward to yet another date bombing.but it didnt.we had so much fun and a good conversation...we went to watch a movie at his house and also had time to impress me with the experience his years had given him.i like him.hes smart and confident and NOT ROB.so hopefully,we'll see eachother soon.everything was going fine until this stupid jackass from my past decided to chime in :

cwgibson13: well maybe i will let u do bad things to me cuz u stole my heart when i met u
djnippy12: i did not
cwgibson13: yes u did , then u went back to your x
djnippy12: well...i mean...something more than sex is what i wanted and you had a lot of potential and i didnt know why you didnt just see that
cwgibson13: see what that u like me?
djnippy12: mm...kinda ..but that just wanting to be with one person is not a bad thing
cwgibson13: do u think of me?

cwgibson13: can i still try?
djnippy12: if things with him dont get real serious,but i dont want just sex.you know that
cwgibson13: i know but get serios with him and let me taste what i missed
cwgibson13: please
djnippy12: why would you want to?
cwgibson13: cuz i like the pain that it bring knowing that i had a good thing and i fucked it up
cwgibson13: i like self destruction
djnippy12: how come you never told me anything like this
cwgibson13: do u want me inside of u
cwgibson13:i would do u so good, and treat u so right for that hr or 2 and then it would just be friend agian

FUCK RACISM.you have to be a really low person to judge someone on the pigment of their skin as opposed to their thoughts,wants and needs.and you know?..it really upsets me the apathy that we still face today.how i am surrounded by ignorance everywhere.i can honestly say that i put in a conservative effort to accept everyone.some people are just lazy and do not want to do that,but its ok,something really bad will happen to you one day and i probably wont care."

"event","many things to say,so little time.lets make some key points:

1.i have yet to make any friends at school yet
2.who has heard of mr.sigler's new girlfriend?yes,thats right,there is yet another woman(or girl if im corect in her identity) that is attracted to rob
3.george bush,does indeed hate black people,if kanye west said it,it must be true
4.i have a little crush on someone.actually,not even a little one.i have a huge crush on the most wonderful person ever.

now,college is not hard if you keep in mind that its only until december and i was relieved today to learn that my psych 103 only has 4 exams and the rest of the class is a lecture.i have the sweetest piece of man in that class.of course he looks about 33,but hey,thats fair game to me.
who could care less about rob anymore? apathy can only continue for so long until the real world crashes right into you.he will learn this eventually.and i am finally,dare i say it,out of love.sure theres still memories that send my brain back into love,but those are only images,not the real thing.i have wrestled with the idea of moving on but it was not until in a drunken state yesterday that i found out he in fact was dating someone.even though he ""wasnt ready for a relationship"" 3 months ago,he is happily involved.
thirdly,if this hurricane doesnt make people see that the federal government is a waste of time,i think they should be shot in the head.we can airdrop food after the tsunami,but not to our own people? now,i have nothing against giving to other countries,but there is some kind of incongruence here.it couldnt have happened at a worse place.as if we already didnt deal with racism,now people will be fighting even longer:black people loot,while white people find food? please.as a caucasian human being,i feel the need to constantly apologize for the conduct exhibited by other caucasians.i am deeply sorry for the unethical treatment placed upon african americans at this time or any other.but in a semi-hypocritical statement,i did see a good number of whites in the images too.
to sum it up.........someone makes me truly happy"

you know.school starts soon.im excited to learn,not excited to assimilate.i dont think i make friends very easily.i mean,im fun to be around,once you know me,but am i a good friend maker? i havent made friends in so long,i think  i have forgotten.the dating scene is crashing and burning,go figure.all except for two sweet ass men.but we will keep that exposed.the alpha male i slept with last month while rob was camping,has been bragging about all the girls he has bedded.shocker.well,we were all disgusted,especially after he was not bad sex at all.i was rolling around in my mind when it occurred that karma was going to fuck him up.and sure enough *snaps fingers*, tha bitch got 2 inches sliced into his leg.i knew there was some omniscient being looking out for me,well,besides anthony markley.also,another topic.check this out,all attractive people are not whores.do you people not get that? i mean,i get about 9540506 IMs a day for just dumb shit and i shouldnt have to justify myself but i do:

CopenHagen315: no its called satisying ur human needs and some people need it so they dont kill themselves
CopenHagen315: im not tryin to sound stupid or immature either
djnippy12: if anyone needs to have sex to keep from killing themselves,i suggest they get a hobby
CopenHagen315: ha ha 
djnippy12: all im saying is emotional makes the physicality better
CopenHagen315: i think ur thinkin about this too hypothetically
CopenHagen315: have u ever had a good relationship w/ out sex
djnippy12: yes
CopenHagen315: 4 how long
CopenHagen315: im tryin to prove a point
djnippy12: a year and then he proposed to me
CopenHagen315: wow
CopenHagen315: whoa
CopenHagen315: mind me asking but what happened
djnippy12: he had to go away to cali and i..met someone else
CopenHagen315: wait u were engaged and u cheated on him
djnippy12: i said i met someone else.i waited until we were broken up to pursue this other person
CopenHagen315: ur really about upholding values arent u 
djnippy12: i try.couldnt tell from the picture,could you?
CopenHagen315: no u should change it, it really does give the wrong impression
djnippy12: well,then i guess i put the impression to shame.im not stuck up or a prude or anything.i like sex and all its forms,actually,more than a lot of people,but not just with anyone
CopenHagen315: well thats what that sites all about meeting people in general not just sex and even though were talkin about thats really not what im about
CopenHagen315: but i do like it a lot
CopenHagen315: ur in a realtionship right now?
djnippy12: no
CopenHagen315: oh 
CopenHagen315: dont u miss sex though
djnippy12: ive had it after the relationship,and i miss it,but im a good masturbator
djnippy12: lol
CopenHagen315: well c wouldnt u prefer a real cock
djnippy12: yes,but that doesnt mean im desparate for it

Jasmine: I think so... All of my friends have boyfriends and we are only the 2 persons left in this world without any special person in our lives

Daniel: Yup I don't know what to do

Jasmine: I know! We'll play a game

Daniel: What game?

Jasmine: i'll be your girl friend for 30 days and you will be my boy friend

Daniel: That's a great plan in fact i don't anything to do for the following weeks...

DAY 1:

They watch their first movie and they both touched in a romantic film

DAY 4:

They went to the beach and have a picnic...Daniel and Jasmine have their quality time together

DAY 12:

Daniel invited Jasmine to a circus and they ride on a Horror House....Jasmine was scared and she touched Daniel's hand but she touched someone else's hand and they both laughed...

DAY 15:

They saw a fortune teller down the road and they asked for their future advice and the fortune teller said: ""My darling, Please don't waste the time of your life... SPend the rest of your time together happily"" Then tears flow out from the teller's eyes

DAY 20:

Jasmine invited Daniel to go to the hill and they saw a meteor...Jasmine mumbled something

DAY 28:

They sat on the bus and because of a bumby road Jasmine gave her first kiss to Daniel by accident

DAY 29:

11:37pm

Jasmine and Daniel sat in the park where they first decided to play this game...

Daniel: I'm tired Jasmine...Do you want any drinks? I'll buy you one.. I'll just go down the road

Jasmine: Apple Juice that's all

Daniel: Wait for me....

20mins later... a stranger approached Jasmine

Stranger: Are you a friend of Daniel?

Jasmine: Why yes? What happened?

Stranger: A reckless drunken driver ran over Daniel and he is critical in the hospital

11:57pm

The doctor went out of the emergency room and he handed out an apple juice and a letter

Doctor: We found this in daniel's pocket

Jasmine reads the letter and it says:

Jasmine, This past few days, i realized you are a really cute girl and i am really falling for you..Your cherish smile your everything when we played this game..... Before this game would end...I wouldlike you to be my girl friend for the rest of my life.... I love you Jasmine....

Jasmine crumples the paper and shouted:

""Daniel ! i don't want you to die... I love you...Remember that night when we saw a meteor, I mumbled something... I mumbled that I wish we would be together forever and never end this game. Please don't leave me Daniel.... I love you! You cannot do this to me!""

Then the clock strikes 12

Daniel's heart stop pumping

THEN IT WAS THE 30TH DAY........

I AM SORRY.we had a brief meeting today and what i thought would give me enjoyment,really just sickened me.you are smart enough to figure sincerity out and you have proved this time and time again,i hope that you will see it this time."

when does a former soulmate become ""former""? or can they ever? 
         tim...i sit alone at night sometimes and i wonder where you are,who youre with and are you as happy as i am? you still play a part in my life as the first person  i ever truly loved but not the love of my life.there is a man 2.5 miles away from me who loves me just the way you did,for all the reasons you did, and loved those same things about me, only he saw me inside as well.you are an amazing person and although these words will never get to you, hopefully fate brings you to me for closure.i dont know why i need to see you, but i do.it will put my life into perspective and end that chapter.my fidelity for rob stands strong, but my burning curiousity screams at me to turn the page and close the book.....i need you.i dont know for what and why,of how you will comfort me,all i know is that you will."

I asked Anna Mayr why god lets this happen to me and she claims it is just a test.well,ive never really been one for god but there needs to be some kind of external locus. rob is the only one i have and that i know anymore,he is still there.even my friends arent.fairweather friends who come and go as they please.hopefully the relatives will shell out enough money for graduation,or i will win the senior class presentation and pocket $1000. i watched a movie based on the life of ed gein yesterday and was so disappointed.there was no gore,no necrophilia, not even the shots of bludgeoning.i came for the death and destruction,not a plot line.whatever."

"event","well,things have continued in a steady downward spiral(lol),for awhile now,all except for my creepers. for everyone who is not informed of what a creeper is,it is a platform grinder, a shoe ,you dumbass. theyre made in the UK so they have to be good.mine will be black and white and only cost $42, where robs cost a measly $189.we decided against matching shoes because i read somewhere that couples who are too much alike tend to get bored with eachother and as the teen people magazine which i live by states, mr.sigler and myself and mirror images.but we do have our differences: i hate punk RAWK,i shower, pride myself in hygiene,function with a normal sex drive, have a wardrobe of more than 4 t-shirts and when my pet needs to be fed, i satisfy it with nourishment,unlike some people. i have also come up with the battle between intelligence and laziness. my AP  exam for english language,which i have spent a grueling year just staying awake in english for,happens to fall upon senior skip day.thats right kids 05-05-05.so,the dissonance lies here: wake up at 6:50 am,take a 3 hour test sans snacks but with free orange juice, or lay in bed,on my ass(which is proven to burn .2 calories for every pound you weigh)until about 11:37 am and have a day with,as i predict my male counterpart.every essential muscle in my body hurts now that he is done with me.i slumped around in school today and later ate some msg free orange flavored chicken with bec (ms.henshaw).got some good tests courtesy of the GyN the other day and i am disease free,go figure."

As I sat in my english class today,watching people convey their love through various art products, I realized that I miss you. Even the minutes I am away from you feel like long, monotonous hours filled with disorganization and weariness.I've built my world around you and I wouldn't want it any other way. I didn't think it was at all possible to love someone this much and love every aspect of them: their smile,their stance,their lexicon and their demeanor. But I also appreciate the beautiful things about you: those eyes that I could stare into forever, the hand that fits perfectly into mine and those arms that have held me for every bad day I have had.You are the man I love but also my best friend. I have experienced so many adventures with you by my side and they seemed more beautiful because I was next to you.The tiffs we have are few and far between and although disagreements are thought of as learning tools, I never wish to use them. To be emotionally distant from you is what I strive to be farthest from. There are not enough hours in the day to tell you how much I love you and there is neither enough time to show you. 
I slipped and I fell into love with the most wonderful person I could ever meet. This person is not judgemental, nor does he care about the negative thoughts of others.He has wiped my tears when I have been distraught and held my hand as I was scared. The best thing I have learned from him is how to appreciate myself.Before this, I had always thought of myself as undeserving of such a love and I figured I could never attain such elation, but then I found a best friend. The day I met him was the best day of my life. And every day with him since had been the catalyst for my happiness.I wish I could share this joy with everyone around me and sometimes I am so happy that I wish I could tell the world of a love so pure and uncomplicated. This is all of my hard work paying off. At first, you were unattainable and we both had pur external locusts to deal with , but we united together one day in this unspoken understanding that we as people, somehow belonged together.I felt as if I had so much to give that had remained dormant for so long and now, you acted as my outlet: my wonderful asylum from the travesties of the world. We have something above all those sublunary lovers who only occupy themselves with petty quarrels. The best time spent with you is the time in which nothing is said. I have spent many quiet nights driving through amber lights, watching you as you sleep. That is the best feeling.By far the best thing I have ever acquired. Infatuation is a trinket but true love is a gift.This is the best thing you have ever given me.
I love you so much that my life seems so easy when I imagine it with you.Just the sound of your voice sends that tingle through my veins, almost stopping my heart and leaving me incapacitated by this intrigue.Your beauty can best be described as what makes the world perfect. If everyone woke up in love, there would be no more discontent with life;there would be no more jealousy,envy or hate because what we are feeling leaves us with this state of actualization which leaves us paralyzed from feeling any pain.At first it was just a dream that seemed so unattainable on a whim but now that I have it, I devote all of my time to maintaining this perfection we embody. I LOVE MY MAR MAR......"

I cannot make it without You 
All my efforts have failed 
So that I will cry out in the need of You 
Restore the strength of my Dependence 
Send me through the fire 
Make me pure again 
Everything I am 
I give it all to You 
In Your arms I wait 
I lay down my life 
I am nothing without You -as i lay dying

no one can possibly feel the elation that i have as we speak.my life, as detestful as it is on the outside is put into perspective by one embrace, one touch and one kiss.however,some people seem to think that what i have is not noteworthy, and to this person i say:

i made you and i can break you, bitch.the facade is up.your coy remarks are nothing put superficials reiterations of what i have said before about others.you are not intelligent,you are able to regurgitate information learned elsewhere."

Three students at Eastern Technical High School have earned the designation of AP Scholar by the College Board in recognition of their exceptional achievement on the college-level Advanced Placement Program (AP) Exams. Congratulations to Doug E., Jason K., and Tina M. who qualified for the AP Scholar Award by completing three or more AP Examinations, with grades of 3 or higher on a 5 point scale. 

all 3 of them are in my AP english class.i took 3 of those tests.out of the two tests i took,i got a 2 and a 3.i wonder how it makes them feel to know that a slacker is recieving the same credit that they are for a class.and also makes me wonder how happy they really are now that they have risen to this ""academic greatness"".to every rise,there is a fall."

"event","i am in the worst mood i have been in for awhile.i accomplished alot of christmas shopping but also had a falling out with rob.it hurts.i am alone tonite and left to contemplate,is love subconsciously based upon ignorance being bliss? as long as they dont tell you whats going on,will everything be ok?
does getting involved with public enemy number 1, constitute a life of misery?
the mall is what started this whole thing.i went with briana after work to see lyd.things eventually led their waay back to rob and we found eachother.walked around for a little bit and then people i didnt know kept approaching him and asking him about these different girls and things of that nature.i totally blew him off,made a scene and walked away,where i managed to see both the one guy i had a crush on for 2 years and the one i was last talking to,but even spite neglected to linger in my mind.i was hurt.so the dissonance lies here ,my friends: do i ,believe the word of mallgoth mouth(ie:moms minivan passengers,the sometimes bis and amanda neff and various juggalos) or do i see past them as a noncredible source and go with the feeling that has felt so right? tough decision, for the fact that all rumors stem from something,some truth.rob disagrees; he believes rumors are most of the time started by bored people who take time out of their DDR playing to make his life hell,which is,not far from feasible.he also almost got into a fight and took on 2 gay guys(which i was ready to enter flailing and ready to kick some ass),but dignity managed to show through.he also explained that he will not hesitate to abandon weak people in his life.which i took as an ultimatum.i love this kid and refuse to let him go but if i have to ,i will cut every piece of essex trash to get to him."

"event","well,i havent written in awhile because ive had one of these weeks that just keep spiraling out of control.ive been enjying work quite a bit because ive been doing more and more to run things.yesterday i took off dec. 18th for a holiday party and christmas eve because i figured if i went to church with my parents,theyd get off of my back.go figure:compromise.anyway....college plans are still an uncertainty.perhaps i will just give up on catonsville and just try to get into journalism at essex.but theres still this sense of continuity,the monotony that i hate of same job,same location,same friends.shouldnt there be some sort of metamorphisis when you graduate?....obviously not.i also took alot of new pictures which i hope to get up soon.last nite i didnt get home until 1:30 am because i took monica and briana home and they pretty much made out the whole time.it was whatev.i didnt mind....actually i did,only a wee bit though.i have a seminar on ""death of a salesman"" tomorrow and i didnt even read the book.i could care less.seems too much like busy work to me.yes,i still think about tim sometimes.thats one thing i cant get over.lydia rodriguez is legal soon,which is also scary.
i spent a good amount of time with rob in the last week and i loved it.we did some shopping in fells point and then had ice cream.its nice to be bouncing back from the bitter reality of someone leaving you when you have someone else there to comfort you.anyway,ive been bugged out about what to get him and i have come up with a few things:one i know for sure which is a book and then im going to check out this anarchist bookstore downtown and see where that can get me.if all has failed,ill come up with something good and wait to mailorder something until his birthday which isnt too far off.we did alot of fun things this week and i drew him a nice picture of us at friendlys the other day,while enjoyed free ice cream.this week,i dont think ive really paid for pretty much anything.in fact,ive been a spoiled little bitch: free starbucks,free friendlys,free meals,free gas.been pretty effing great.well,i guess i'll continue the cycle and go get ready for work."

"event","so whatev.im sure everyone is DYING to know what is new in the life of mediocrity,so where do i begin.......first,i finished reading American Psycho compliments of anthony markley and what i thought was a book that would blow my mind,kind of a.)unnerved me and b.) bored me.let me explain.the protagonist is just a pretentious asshole who describes in detail,what each person is wearing,down to the name,label,color etc.second,the gore is a bit overrated.while ripping someones larnyx from their body while there lips have been cut off does sound inticing,its hardly imaginable.there has only been one mainstream case of that and i cant put my finger on the killer at the moment(i want to say henry lee lucas),anyway,and the sex scenes are out of control.i mean,some of this stuff,made me never want to have sex again and other parts made me want to never stop having sex.all in all,this book went through me like i dont know what.i couldnt stop reading it only because he derived such a pleasure fom killing these girls.bah.anyway,i tried to get rob into it.i believe he has read it already.i know anthony will be disappointed because i liked the rules of attraction better than american psycho.thats all we do anymore is talk about how to coerce sex and speak pf how to kill people.and now,rob does it too.hes a jack the ripper fan,im an ed gein fan and anthony is a dahmer fan.pretty soon,we will all be getting hopped up on coke,and fuck each other.......or not,which is fine as well.ive been finding alot of solace in a select few:lydia,hollie,anna mayr,caitlin and trying to distance myself from those toxic to my already unpleasant demeanor.ive been slowly crawling out of the hell ive been stuck in for awhile.things with rob are decent i suppose.we have talked for short intervals in the last couple days and because he has beaten halo 2,i presume we will talk more and actually hang this weekend.the agenda goes as follows:
      FRIDAY
cash my check,shop,work until 9 tomorrow,shop(i'll settle for white marsh, as long as im in and out with no mall goths attached to me,rent movies

      SATURDAY
work(take off of work on thanksgiving,wait when is thanksgiving?maybe i dont have to..),luncheon with mr. anthony markley,which he has invited rob to also,more shopping? trip to the bank?

     SUNDAY
college applications,trip to trade secrets to attain some hair product.work (not in that order)

i am also waiting for a certain ms.elysa montFORD to call me back.my line is free tonite because mr.sigler(rob) is out of town subjecting himself to bad music once again. *sighs* fucking call me montford.

i miss tim </3.....babe,someone told me that god never gives you what you cant handle....i told them they were wrong and that everything is situational and that loss, is always unbearable."

"event","ah so today was not a good day and the title c/o etid says it all.last nite i totally fucking lost it.the worst i have been in awhile.thank god for blackouts.
i was so sad at everything,pissed off at nothing.sat and read for awhile and decided to write.turned on some eighteen visions followed by lamb of god but it didnt seem to calm me.took a shower and then a gradual bath.decided that meds would do the trick so i hopped up on the leftover oxy and tried to tire myself out by performing various...activities.it was not bad.i did not disappoint myself and if not for my bad mood,i would have left my night at that.but i wasnt satisfied.i sat down to write and managed to scrawl out 2 pages of a really good poem which was,of course,tim-inspired.whatev.i guess whatever attempts at sedation i had tried,failed because i ended up being upset and throwing a fit by myself.i called rob and of course,he didnt pick it up.he called me back but we didnt talk.how hard is it to pick up a phone?....around 10:40 i suppose,i got angry and sad and full of what i precieve now as lust and became bored with myself.i remember going into the bathroom and noticing both my parents on the couch.after sitting down,i remember seeing the razor sitting in the shower,just there.i picked it up and ran it against my skin.not hard,or what i thought was not hard,i went back to bed crying and half asleep called rob again and threw the phone after no answer.i woke up this morning and didnt even bother doing my hair and i noticed the cuts on my wrist.felt stupid,ashamed and EMO but then again,i dont really remember it so its not my fault.ive been stumbling around the whole day in a trance of sorts i suppose.finished reading the rules of attraction.it blew my mind.and i also talked sex with the class whore today and i believe,gained not only her respect but bragging rights.today was one of those days i want to curl up in my bathtub and die.........ive been doing all of my homework lately."

"event","so today sucked again.i napped.thats was about it.i went to school,came home and took a nap nap nappy.nothing exciting ever happens during the week.i uploaded trent reznor as my default picture and a picture of myself will follow.instead of bitching about my love life,or lack there of,lets complain about something else: today i almost was jumped by 1/2 the female population in my law class after responding to a prompt with an anti-feminist stance.i know i am in no way incorrect when i say that any rights movement has failed in the past and womens rights is just another attempt.the civil rights movement,was a great idea,it had so much potential,but racism still exists and not even traditional racism, hate derived from a backlash of the movement.womens rights,same thing.social darwinism defines the female sex as being the nurturers and that is the way it should be.i told briana that gay righhts is the same thing.i love my gay friends,hell,the man i am in love with likes men,but if anyone thinks that society can handle gay marriage,they have obviously not studied the way society reacts to change.i have no religious ties against marriage being consumated between a man and a woman, but if tomorrow gay people may marry, the public will retaliate against them. the conservative stronghold still has a tight grip and perhaps in 10 years,this will change,but not now.put into simple terms: the USA is not ready for such a drastic change.in my opinion, the best opinion is one that looks out for both parites and that is what i am doing. the more we assimilate,the better things get but in time.then she says that the only thing i have against me is that i am a female and that is why i speak so ignorantly.this is also false.yes,i may be female,this is true.she claims that she is a black female lesbian so she has more hardships.well,do you regret being any of these characteristics? if you do not,do not use it as an excuse.the minority title is an excuse for apathy.i know i am correct because i have black and gay friends that side with me.whatev.

california will never come gracefully.he has realized the human in my mistake and is repulsed by me. what i thought of as the perfect relationship,is now nothing more than a 4000 mile difference caught amidst lies,deception and betrayal.all of these things,i take the blame for. i am so weak of a person that i compromised unconditional love for temporary happiness.in other words,tim broke up with me.after the months of not speaking and me lying to him about rob, he said he didnt love me anymore and couldnt get over what i had done.billions of words scream from inside me,but only one surfaces:wonder.
i know i was wrong.so wrong and if i knew that losing tim would be a consequence of rob,i would erase everything.this is my world.he is my fucking life.the person i want to spend the rest of my life with and wake up next to in the morning,is not taking my phone calls and has fallen out of love with me.ive lost my love to the west coast.i have literally lost myself.where do i fucking go from here? who else wants me now that my soulmate doesnt? the burning question"

calfornia,gracefully

two sets of taillights burn dim and divide,
stretch for miles making track marks across what veins fail to carry.
you should have taken my keys while my hands were shaking.
you could have kept the dead gone, entombed in the soil of arms.
raise the breathing abrasion with a turn of the key.
lost motor skills and a set cruise control.
mangled insect screams through the puddles of drool.
mainline the highway baby,
tie off the concrete veins and set the radio to fm
love songs clocked relapse defined by the rpm's of a static heart,
reanimated by the rush of eyes and horizon.
nothing warms like a road flare when caution sets.
anodyne seeps like dashed yellow lines through the withdrawn rearview addict.
drenched to the drawn teeth in seething foam.
if you want me dead, you should have called me home.
rumble strip as pulse prevents retreating eyes, dilate and close.
i can feel the dry heaves moisten, i can feel the blood withdraw.
you are my failed twelve step program.
a red light could kick this habit, a needle full of the junkies fuel.
drops of blood on her fingertips.
your arms are a deprivation chamber.
sterile to sixty in forever flat.
dissolve into the coast like john wayne.
a hero and his heroine."

"event","feeling kinda down today and for a good reason.homecoming is in 2 days and i feel like rob and i arent meshing like we should.its almost like a rift between 2 people.when we went to that party,elysa was telling me that he was all over her and he said he wasnt and that he had to justify nothing because he knew he did nothing wrong.so now its like between my best friend and the person i love,or,excuse me,the person who loves me.an its been plaguing me for so long that i dont know who to listen to and im contemplating forgetting the whole thing.he seems so sure of himself but then again,so does she.he does play around alot but why should i care,we're not together.if i were a friend,i would look at myself and say:
youre an idiot.stop settling for mediocrity.i cant believe that you put yourself out there to be an o so independent and confident woman if youre picking all these punk ass guys.sure they seem great in the beginning but they suck.you have one who says he loves you but never fucking calls or makes plans but then he turns it into a guilt trip so you feel bad and i have another one,who thinks like a fucking child and whom i feel like i cant trust now.omg,im cracking up.drama is for 4 year olds and to be left at the sand box........i found a dress.its like knowing youre better than all this but having to settle for these guys that.....ugh.its just bad as a whole.i have never found a guy that demonstrates that he is deserving of me and i know im worth it.the only one to come close,is,in fact,tim...so if youre reading this,dont throw a little bitch fit about rob because,yes,i still love you.i just want to take people and say ""STUPID' and smack them in the head.i have to call dann tonite.he gave me his number.maybe i can make something out of....well,almost nothing.yada yada yada...i hate my life...bitch bitch...sound like a mall goth......im s much better than this.ah hubris and how i love its many forms."

"event","so today wasnt a great day or even a decent day,it was a bad day.since it was lowerclassman testing,we had law all day and he told us it would be stupid for us to even show up.i planned on staying home like everyone else but o no.it was me and about 8 others kicking it in law.while everyone else enjoyed dennys and ihop bought by their parents,i worked on my senior independent project.halfway through the morning,i decided that the office was better than mr.lalli and his disgraceful excuse for teaching so i tried to get sent to the office.at first it may seem stupid but i tried for the longest time...and nothing.heres the weekly synopsis:
friday-i dont remember what i did
saturday-elysa,rob and i decided to go to mark weirs party but we got lost,she followed me and i got lost.rob cant read directions so we just went to ihop where it looked like i was straight off of route 40.the party was supa lame and rob wanted to go home so we left.that nite,he got upset or something so we just stopped hanging out
sunday-eh
monday-lindsay came over
tuesday-went shopping with bec and dan.dan threw a bitch fit so we took him home.then we met up with fritz johnson,alan,mark and j wise and planned homecoming outfits.they looked good and today we made spirit day shirts.eh"

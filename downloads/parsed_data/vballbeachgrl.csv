"event","Well, we got through Wilma.  I heard her all night as she arrived, it was very scary.  As soon as it was over Mark and I drove to my house.  I was pretty much having a heart attack the whole time in the car.  We had to take a detour and that really opened my eyes to the damaged that had occurred.  We had to drive through flooded streets, we saw tons of trees down, lanai cages were down, we saw a huge palm tree on top of an obviously damaged car.  The anxiety was just building up before we got to the house....  And then we got to the street which is off of my street.  It WAS lined with palm trees all the way down.  However, it looked like every other palm tree was down.  Luckily there was enough room to drive through the palms (the top of the trees).  We SLOWLY drove down the road and then got to my street, which was flooded.  We had to park in the pool parking lot.  That's when I broke down.  There was a huge palm tree that fell over and broke the fence around the pool.  It was still in the pool, which was a mess.  The corner house had two huge trees down, one in the drive way.  Their lanai's cage was also down.  So we walked to my house, which was 2 houses down from the pool.  I had to walk in water to get my mail.  I saw on the side of the house that our lanai screen was in tact.  That made me happy.  I quickly went into the house and everything was ok.  It was truly a miracle.  It was like the hurricane went around our house, not touching it.  But, it definitely touched everything else.  

Mark's house was not damaged at all and like my house, his neighbors on either side had little damages to their house, but that's it.  It was another miracle.  His land phone is still not working, but we can't complain!  My cell phone just finally started working.  His friends who live 2 miles away do not have any power.  We are very lucky again.  It isn't too, too bad though because it's cool outside!  The cold front came very quickly after the storm.  Ironically, it was very sunny immediately after the storm yesterday.  It was very wierd.  It was very windy all day though.  The wind finally died down today.

I have off of work the rest of the week!  Fun stuff!  I actually went on a walk today with Mark's dog, Dixie.  We had a good 'ol time!  Haha!  I guess I will start working out this week!!!"

"event","So Wilma is coming our way.  Scary????  Well, not for Mark....which is good for me.  It's literally coming right in our direction.  Fun stuff.  No hurricane parties like last time when Charlie hit.  Anyway, we should be ok.

Meg, I hope Keats is doing better.  That is so sad he had to get surgery.  And he got in a fight with Russ's cat??!!  That jerk.  Please kill the cat for me when you see him....

We carved pumpkins last night.  Mine is the definite winner.  Mine is the typical carved pumpkin.  Mark's is...well....funny.  It was fun!  I made good pumpkin seeds too....Papa was right...40 minutes in the oven!  

Alrighty, wish us luck for when WILMA hits!!!!!"

"event","Thanks goodness for this on-line journal.  It allows me to be entertained during Alabama football games....haha!  Just kidding...I enjoy watching the games but it is fun to make an entry!  Mark is watching the game...they are winning 7-3, so that's ALWAYS good!  ROLL TIDE!  It's Saturday and I literally just finished my work week.  Not only did we have 3 vball games during the week, but I had to coach for Volleyschool this morning (for 4th-8th grade kids).  I was NOT happy getting up this morning.  I also had to go to a 5:30 Friday night meeting for work!  I know, totally ridiculous, but it was nice because I got to hold my supervisor's 5-week old baby girl.  She was beautiful.  Anyway, I just attempted a nap, but that wasn't working.  I guess that's it from me....now it's time to enjoy my weekend!  Meg, how is it without those braces of yours??!!"

"event","Yes, I am a quitter.  It has been a week since I quit my club volleyball job and I AM SO HAPPY!  It was ridiculously stressful!!  I just decided I didn't need that annoyance anymore and that it was totally not worth the money.  So, after the high school volleyball season (which is separate from club), I will have time!  I won't know what to do with myself!!  It will be so great...  It has been a loooong time since I updated my journal.  The biggest update?  I HAVE A WONDERFUL MAN IN MY LIFE NOW.  He's so great.  Mark is his name and he is the best ever.  It's been 5 months....but it seems like we've known each other forever.  Ladies out there...if you take any advice that I give....be patient and wait for your prince charming to come.  He will and it will be the best thing that ever happened to you.  I promise.  Any other updates?  My niece will soon be SIXTEEN!  WOO HOO!  By the way, she is the coolest ever (:"

"event","Well, I was going to wait until March 14 to write in my journal to make it a full month since the last one, but I just had this sudden urge to make a new entry.  JUST FOR MY NIECE!!  So mama and papa were here for a little over a week and we had a good time.  I felt bad cause I had to leave for their last weekend to go to Orlando for a vball tourney, but I think they were cool with it.  I got my hair cut yesterday and it's SHORT!  It looks good but needs to grow a little more.  I went to the dentist today.  I am a new woman.  Work is good.  I like everything but the whiney people.  Really whiney lately.  It's annoying.  I think they are getting my nonverbal cues (turning around and working on the computer) that I am sick listening to them.  Well I think that's it about my exciting life.  Adios amigos!"

"event","I hate Valentine's Day.  It's the one day of the year that I allow myself to be negative.  Ironic, huh?!  My niece is even getting more action than I am!  (Go Meg with the flowers!!!)  The only good thing for me about Valentine's Day is that the people you truly do love, your family and friends, let you know.  That's nice.  That's about it when you are single (:  And I guess it could be a lot worse....(there's my positive angle!!).

By the way, it's 75 degrees here."

"event","I had a great day yesterday.  Went for a bike ride, layed out, talked to Meg on-line, talked to another friend on-line and then went out!  I just woke up!!  It's a miracle.  I did wake up earlier but then I forced myself to go back to sleep.  The cold front is over...it's 69 right now (:  I have practice from 4-6 today in Ft. Myers so that should be fun.  I am refreshed from a day off of it!  Alrighty, that's it for now.  Until next time..."

"event","Seriously, she is the coolest!  Megan, my wonderful niece, made my journal the prettiest colors!!!  So FUN!!  Had fun last night...  I was tired though so came home fairly early--11pm--is that early?  I guess it is for a night out.  Plus, I am an old lady now.  Slept in...well, sort of.  I hate it because I am so used to getting up early during the week, and I have the hardest time sleeping in when I can.  So, I woke up at about 7:30 and layed in bed until 9am!  At least I could do that.  No vball today.  Sick of it and need a day off.  I went for a bike ride this morning...it was beautiful.  A little chilly (60 degrees) but I managed.  Haha, Meg thought you'd like that comment!  We are currently in a cold front here in SW Florida.  60...a cold front??!!  They are rediculous down here!!!  Okay, that's it for now..."

"event","Today I talked to my niece Megan over IM and she is my hero.  She is the best niece anyone could have.  She writes these cool journal entries on-line and always makes me laugh when we IM each other.  Did I say she was my hero?  She is the coolest girl ever.  She loves music and all these musical guys, I can't keep up.  She loves them.  I understand because she is my hero.  She goes to Nardo and takes after her aunt because I went there too.  We are Nardos.  We are cool Nardos.  She's cooler than me though because she is my hero.  She wanted me to write in my journal so she could respond back to me.  Her comment won't be as good as my journal entry, but that's okay cause she's my hero.  She is my niece and my hero.  I looked at her entry today and she had the following list on it.  Apparently I need to bold what I am...let's see how it goes.  I want to be just like Megan, but let's see...  Okay I can't figure out how to bold so I will star what I am.

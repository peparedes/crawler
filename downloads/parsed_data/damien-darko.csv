"event","Pilate washed the blood from his hands and sealed the fate of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Broken, bent and beaten, Jesus began the long walk with his cross amid the stones and jeers of the collected Romans and Jews, taunting the Messiah as he stumbled three times.

And they tied his wrists and nailed his palms to the cross, erecting the massive wooden structure and letting him hang until dead.

And in his anguish, the lord screamed:

""My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?!?"" And he passed into death.

In the night, his disciples lowered him from the cross and entombed him in the cave on the mountain. Placing a large boulder in its entry to prevent those who would defile his body.

Upon the third day, they returned to the tomb to find the stone moved and the burial shroud laying in a corner. They were afraid and angry. The went to the village to find they who had defiled the crypt and stolen the Lord.

On the road, in the morning's light, they happened upon a figure walking naked with hair flowing. As they approached, they knew it was He, who is lord.

Simon-Peter ran to the lord to embrace him.

And the Lord said unto him: ""BRAINS...."" And lo, did he take a large bite out of Simon-Peter's skull."

"event","I periodically check in with the two people I list on my friends page (Two friends. How truly pathetic.), but I'm unsure if anyone actually reads the drivel I post here. (Okay, the drivel I posted here, as I haven't updated in, oh, I don't know, 74 years.)

I'm not asking for feedback, but some cash, or a copy of the <i>Silver Spoons</i> theme would be nice from time to time. 

Regardless, I'm not complaining or anything. I'm really just curious. 


Well, curious and wondering why Black Lighting suddenly has kids, but that's another matter.

So, to recap, I want to know who's here, I'm wondering what ever happened to Joel Higgins, questioning the rationality of anyone asking about the romantic life of a two-dimensional racial stereotype, and I'm annoyed that Bruce Jenner won't get out of my kitchen pantry."

This almost makes up for the trauma I suffered while, when I was dealing wiht a bout of insomnia on my trip to Texas, I was subjected to the horror that is <i>Cuck Norris: Karate Komandoes</i>. That was just pitiful."

You see, in Dallas, there is only one thing worth seeing: the location where the LAST person from Massachusetts that I know of was shot in the head by a local Texan.

Needless to say, I've been spending a lot of time in hiding while here."

"event","For those of you who are unaware, I have known <a href=""http://pegasus316.livejournal.com/"">Pegasus316</a> for a while, having been in a band with him, as well as, for a time, living under the same roof and surreptitiously taking photos of him while he was sleeping in his underwear (sorry, man). 

Anyway, prior to any of this happening, when things were a bit tight, financially, for all of us, he worked in a movie theatre and I usually made my money the old-fashioned way: blackmailing random people in the phone book, convincing them that I knew something nasty about them.

Now, for a tangent:

Around this time, Milton Bradley had come out with a children's game called ""Mr. Bucket"", which I won't really bother to explain, I will just point out that the advertisements for the game had the most irritatingly catchy jingle, the lyrics of which were:

<i>I'm Mr. Bucket
You drop your balls in my top,
I'm Mr. Bucket
Out of my mouth they will pop!
I'm Mr. Bucket
We're all going to run
I'm Mr. Bucket
Buckets of fun!""</i>

(At this time, I need to point out that Mr. Bucket is no longer available. There is some question as to whether the product was pulled because of the somewhat...homosexually suggestive jingle, or because someone made a somewhat amusing video dealing with said jingle)

Back to the point...

Around this time I had a bit of a psychological issue (I'm much more psychotic now, so EVERYTHING will be fine.) where I could easily get a song caught in my head.

As it happens, I got the Mr. Bucket jingle stuck in my head.


For about four months solid.

I heard in everywhere. In the car, in the shower, in the kitchen, I would dream the damn song.

Four months pass by and one day, finally, Mr. Bucket haunted me no more. (Not that I realized that, mind you. If I had, then the song would have gotten stuck in my head, again.)

So, another friend of mine and I went to see Pegasus316 at work, since he was a friend of ours and we were going to head out for coffee after he got off work. We got there a few hours early, since he could get us into  movie. Like I said, money was tight. Anyway...

We went to meet him as he was slinging popcorn. He grabbed a couple of passes and then went to get us some popcorn. As he turned to get the fake butter-like substance, I could hear him sing under his breath...

""I'm Mr. Bucket...""

This, of course, got the jingle stuck in my head for another few months. On that day, back in 1995, I swore one day, I would have my revenge and get that tune stuck in his head.

Today, Pegasus316, is that day!

""I'm Mr. Bucket..."""

"event","As most of you are aware, I'm usually the happy-go-lucky hebephrenic that makes random observations or comments that make very little sense, but they do tend to make me laugh. hopefully, one or two of them have been amusing to you, as well.

Today, though, there is something else on my mind. 

I'm curious: have any of you ever been sitting around, minding you own business when, suddenly, a memory of a previous time in your life comes cashing through your mind, leaving a lot of damage in its wake, making you wish, beyond all reason, to be able to travel back in time to correct mistakes you made which have made irrevocable alterations in your life and karma?

There is something similar going on with me. 

A few days back, I suddenly began almost reliving a two year stretch in my mind. In that original space of time, things happened to me and because of me that have forever changed who I am. Normally, I would consider it to be a ""water under the bridge"" type of thing, but, for reasons I can't begin to explain, or even understand, I cannot view it in this manner. There were mistakes made and events which transpired that I want, desperately, to change. There are two problems here, though:

1. No matter how crazy I am, I am lucid enough to realize that I do not have the ability to go back in time, though I truly wish to be able to.

2. While I am stuck with the memories of this time ripping through my psyche and opening a lot of old wounds, I do not know the single occurence which, obviously, has caused me a phenomenal amount of pain, though I have a general idea of the people involved.

I want to make things right, though I doubt it would do any good at this point. A lot of time has passed. About a decade ago, a friend of mine went through something similar. We referred to it, at the time, as his ""Karma Tornado"". 

It appears that I am now going through my own Karma Tornado."

Kevin knows more about this kind of pop-culture than even I do (and, remember, I have no life to speak of). 

After reading the post Kevin put up regarding <i>The Gary Coleman Show</i> airing on Cartoon Network, I, naturally, began setting my alarm so I could get up and watch this gem of a cartoon every morning. This has caused a trememndous lack of sleep, which may be the reason for my following call to action:

People: We need to get Cartoon Network, which already has the rights to <i>The Gary Coleman Show</i> to put it back in production!

Here's my plan: We get Cartoon Network to rework the show so that it takes place now, twenty-some years later. Gary's Character, Andy, is still an angel and still helping out around the same town. Still helping the same people (who are no longer kids, of course, but still getting in the same kind of trouble), and still trying to protect his halo from Hornswaggle, who now, inexplicably, speaks only rhyme. On top of all of this, Andy, who has not aged, will be Governor of California (Personally, I think Gary Coleman was robbed!)

We need to e-mail this idea to Cartoon Network!"

As it happens, because I'm alone, and the room is sound-proofed, I tend to sing, which is not too big a deal for me, having been a singer in the past. Unfortunately, one of my co-workers came in while I was singing at near the top of my lungs.

This was embarrassing for two reasons:

1. I was singing <i>Tarzan Boy</i> by Baltimora. If you don't remember it from the 80's, you can <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=tarzan+boy+baltimora"">Google it</a>.

2. I do not know a SINGLE lyric to the song, or even how the tune goes, except for the odd ""Tarzan-style"" singing bit that appears throughout the song. THAT is what I was caught singing at the top of my lungs.

"event","This is one of those rare entries where the title has absolutly nothing to do with the content.

I realize that I've not updated in a while, even though I am now out of hiding (yes, that's official). Things are kind of busy here in Hell's Arsehole. I've been having to do a lot of work around the house.

I suppose I should take the time to explain my house to those of you (ie everyone) who have not seen it before.

My house (or, as I like to call it: <i>Maison di Casa</i>) was built about 100 years ago by people who didn't quite understand the concepts of ""inside"" and ""outside"". This was, apparently, in an era I will call ""Pre-Grover"" (okay, it's not ""near"" and ""far"", but it's pretty close.)

The way I can best explain how I came to the conclusion that these pre-humans of Nashville had difficulty with this concept bases itself around the main hallway.

You see, the house is, as are many houses down here, made of brick. That is to say that the entire outside of the structure is made of red brick, giving it an appearence I can only call ""bricky"". Esentially, I live in a giant chineny, or at least, one would think so looking from the outside.

Inside the house, there are 6 major rooms, all of which are connected by one main hall. Each room is fairly standard, being all generally rectangular in shape with whitish walls and a ceiling roughly 15 feet up. (As a side note, this is a fantastic change from my first apartment, in which I had to duck for fear of being decapitated by a ceiling fan.)

The hallway, however, is not quite what one would expect. 

It is roughly pentangular in shape, which is not a big deal, and the ceiling is just as high. The walls are, again, whitish in colour. The odd thing, though, is they are sided.

Yes, you read that correctly.

My main hallway has wooden siding. 

So, basically, what I'm trying to say is the idiot who built my house, built it inside out."

Those who knew me in the past know I was, at one point, tattoo free. This has changed within the last couple of years. Actually, I now have three tattoos.

The first I got is on the inside of my left wrist and looks like the image pictured <a href=""http://www.7parabian.com/Images/watcher.gif"">here</a>, but mine (as is correct to the actual design) has 13 small circles in the outer ring, not 8. (Yes, I am enough of a geek to not only get tattooed after a Sci-Fi tv show, t to know the design I linked to is subtly incorrect.)

The second one I got is the roman numeral DCLXVI on my upper left arm. Yes, it means something and yes, to many (especially around here) it is offensive, but I like to do that to people.

The last is <a href=""http://www.grevens.dk/images/bunny.jpg"">Frank the Bunny</a> on the outside of my right calf.

You see, M theory, and the precedent Quantum Theory, state that all things, matter, energy and everything else within the universe, are all different forms of the same thing (thing being used, in this case, in the relative sense, since we can't call non-things ""things"" in the literal sense, hence why M and Quantum give most people headaches.)

I haven't been able to do much for halloween the last few years for various reason including, but not limited to, incarceration on charges of conspiracy to commit parking violations.

This year was different, though. I was available, free on my own recognizance and able to go to a few large scale halloween parties.

Regardless, as many of you know, Nashville is the buckle of the Bible-belt. It makes for have a good time in my normal, debaucherous way, a little difficult most of the time.

That brings me to the story of the parties I went to this year. I hit two of them. At each one of them, people, as expected, were dressed in various odd costumes. (I did my tribute to Tom Savini). What was unexpected, however was the young ladies dressed, literally, in nothing but latex body paint. Without getting into too much detail, I can tell you with some degree of certainty that they were cold.

Also surprising was the young woman I observed having sex at three different times with three different partners. I did not observe her leaving towards a back room with them, or going off to a car with them. No, I observed her bending over a table for them.

I'll tell you, nights like these make me think that Nashville may not be as lame as I initially thought."

"event","Okay, I've spent the last few days running from a somewhat...irritated mob across the state of Alabama. It seems they are a bit touchy about the whole abortion thing. I suppose trying to calm them down by repeatedly shouting ""Jesus liked to touch little boys"" was probably not the best tactic I've ever had, either.

Regardless, I'm back on the campaign trail and I'm heading toward my next stop: Crawford, Texas.

In Crawford, I will be giving a speech titled ""Why did you goat-rapers elect Bush?""

I'm thinking it will be a big success.

"event","Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I've threatened to do this before, but now, I can legally do this:

I am officially announcing my candidacy for President of the United States in 2008. 

Some will ask what my platform is. Well, it is, at the moment, a work in progress. Here's what I have so far:

1. If elected, the military will never again have a shortage of bunnies. 

2. I will guarantee some pot for every chicken.

3. If elected...Spirographs for Everyone!

4. I will appoint Adam West ambassador to the UN, however, I would require that he wear the Batman costume...for...national security.

So, that's all I have right now, but I'll be coming up with more soon.

In the mean time, I will be hitting the trail. First stop will be tomorrow in Snodgrass, Alabama where I will be providing free abortions to everyone...even the men.

Until then, remember:

A vote for Damien Darko is a vote for Ponies!"

"event","And it's playing on Sci-Fi as I type.

I am referring, of course, to <i>Supernova</i>. 

If you have not seen this movie, we;ll you're in the vast majority. I, however, was dumb enough to have paid money to see this when it was in theatres. It is a decision I regret nearly as much as when I mistakenly went to see <i>Left Behind</i>, thinking it was a disaster movie, rather than a disaster of a movie.

The plot of <i>Supernova</i> can best be described as ""crap with shit dressing"". It revolves around a hospital ship going after some odd distress call, being hit by...oh, I don't know...maybe a bus, then it picks up some guy who looks kinda like James Caviezel, but doesn't seem to have the acting skills of a brick.

So the lookalike has some kind of superpowers that he got from a cosmic lava-lamp. These powers appear to allow him to seduce Robin Tunney (which, frankly, doesn't seem that difficult).

Somehow or another, pretty much everyone dies in a spectacularly unimpressive manner, and Robin Tunney exposes her breasts in a spectacularly unimpressive manner.

Probably the one thing that could have saved this movie would be Bill Cosby's super hero from <i>Fat Albert</i>: <i><b>The Brown Hornet</b></i>

That's the odd thing about living here in <i>Hell's Arsehole</i>, they call this ""Music City"", but the description could more accurately be ""Bad Music City"". 

Think about it: Most of you have heard country music on the radio at one point and thought ""Man, that sucks! How in the name of Ahura-Mazda did that get on the radio?""

Well, imagine living in a city full...<b><i>FULL</i></b> of people who play and write country music that is so bad, they won't put it on the radio, especially considering what they <i>DO</i> put on the radio.

There was a superstition there (and, I think around other horse tracks, as well) that it was a huge stroke of good luck to find a $2 bill. The superstition said that you should never spend a found $2 bill, but keep it with you at all times.

I tell you this to explain what happened yesterday and why it seems so odd to me.

Yesterday afternoon, leaving work, I found some money on the ground. That part is not so unusual, of course. Lucky, to be sure, but not unheard of.

The difference this time is the fact that the money consisted of not one, but five $2 bills. Even more strange was the fact that the five bills had sequential serial numbers.

I suppose the people in Saratoga would want me to bet on the Exacta.

In my dream, I was in a competition to host a children's TV show. Probably the strangest part about that is the fact that my view on children is about the same as my view on processed luncheon meat: Tasty, but I don't want them anywhere near me.

So during this competition, I wound up partnering up with Captain Kangaroo, which was kind of a trip, since I grew up watching that show. The two of us started tripping out on the Nitrous Oxide from whipped cream cans and then we started with the random hijinx, which were being judged by Arte Johnson, Jamie Farr and Jaye P. Morgan. Upon receiving a low judgement, the two of us began screeching like banshees and beating the crap out of Gene Gene the Dancing Machine.

Would the opposite of casual sex be formal sex? And if so, does that mean that it becomes a black tie affair? What if it's not an affair at all, but formal sex with your significant other? Does that mean that it is impossible to have formal sex with your regular partner?

<b>MEDIUM:</b> General
<b>Theme:</b> Love
<b>TITLE:</b> Your Love is like a Summer Breeze
Note: I created this as a two album set. This album has some softer songs that I think make great love songs. The other is called Your Love is like a Hurricane and has the harder, louder music. Sorry if some of the choices are odd, especially Fountains of Wayne. Not everyone's first choice but everyone gets their own opinion.

<center>1. Edwin McCain ""I'll Be""
Tell me that we belong together/Dress it up in the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips

2. Charlie Rich ""Behind Closed Doors""
And when we get behind closed doors
then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me  feel like  I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

3. Norah Jones ""Come Away With Me""
And I want to wake up with the rain/Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms

4. Fountains of Wayne ""All Kinds of Time""
he's got all kinds of time/he's got all kinds of time
all kinds of time

5. The Damnwells ""Texas""
I sing a song I wrote for you/a hundred melodies so blue
will you be my stolen rain/that washed it all together

6. Dana Glover ""It Is You (I Have Loved)""
But now I know just who you are/And I know you hold my heart
Finally this is where I belong

7. John Mayer ""Your Body Is a Wonderland""
one mile to every inch and/your skin like porcelain
one pair of candy lips and your bubblegum tongue

8. Bryan Adams ""Don't Let Go""
I've been waiting all my life/To make this moment feel so right
The feel of you just fills the night/So come on, just hold on tight

9. Rosie Thomas ""All My Life""
I'm tired of being on my own/I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting for you to come

10. Ryan Adams ""Desire""
What is this fire?/Burning slowly. My one and only.
Desire. Desire. Desire</center>


If you'd like just one or two, let me know and I'll upload them by themselves.
Look for the 2nd mix Your Love is like a Hurricane soon. 
Also as soon as I stop being lazy, I will complete great mixes such as The Stalker CD, Gong Yoo is Sexy (Or, I'm So Single), Physical Punishment, and Let It Go or Let It Be. Enjoy."

That's like....well, I don't know exactly how much time it is, but believe me when I say it's alot.  I'm also enjoying the newest Nightwish album: Dark Passion Play.  Even if the new lead singer doesn't have quite the operatic power that Tarja does, she does have a highly decent voice that goes well with the band."

Hi, ho! Lovable and friendly, you get along well with everyone you know.
You're a big thinker, and sometimes you over think life's problems.
Don't worry - everyone know's it's not easy being green.
Just remember, time's fun when you're having flies!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/themuppetpersonalitytest/"">The Muppet Personality Test</a></div>

So, there we have it.  Special wished to the initial K on her birthday!  Horray and enjoy your present.  Make sure to let me know if you'd like your receipt for any reason.

Also, the ex-boy apparently feels guilty that we are not friends.  He wanted to . . . get together or something and. . . I don't know.  Boys are so weird.  
Not sure about that one.

The Nine Inch Nails song ""Right Where It Belongs.""  It's lovely and I discovered it through an AMV.  GO AMVS!!!!  They are wonderful things.  It's like watching a little trailer.  The next best thing is Samurai Champloo.  Mugen is like a mix between Cowboy Bebop's Spike and Ed.  Spike's attitude complimented by Ed's limberness.  
So, I finally finished a book I had been reading for about 5 weeks.  I started reading a book on Cinderella Man (James J. Braddock) and Max Baer.  Stupid boxing obsession.  I know next to nothing about it, but I'm still so intregued.  Also, here's some useless information: James Braddock's real middle name was Walter.  They put a J in there because it sounded good.  There were like 5 other boxers from that time and back that were called James J.  Yes, so boxing is wonderful.  
AnimeIowa was fun.  Boy, lots of strange people.  The goth people didn't scare me.  Most of the guys in female character costumes didn't scare me.  I also was only slightly bothered by the girls in male costumes.  No, the ones that scared me were the yoai fan girls.  It's not that I didn't know it was out there.  I just didn't know that there were that many people who liked it and that they were that vocal.  You know, I believe in personal preference and while I don't agree with it, I'm not going to go up to people and lecture them about my opinions.  I don't think that it would do any good either.  It was just a little eye openning. But it was fun to cosplay, even though only 1 person knew who I was (or said anything).  And it was also cool to see someone else as the same character, and now that I did all I can say is, ""MINE WAS SO MUCH BETTER!""  Just kidding.  
So: ""bad fangirl, no yoai"""

If you want to go to bed at 6:30, no one's going to stop you and no one's coming in to wake you up.  I do feel better, but rather groggy.  14 hours of sleep can do that to you.  That means no church for me today, but I'm ok with that.  
I'm extremely excited though.   I'm just waiting for next weekend (ANIME CON!!!) when I can dress up and act strange and meet other weird people.  Thank goodness I'm sick now, instead of next weekend.  And I can hopefully work enough on Sunday and Monday to cover hotel and gas (nasty raising prices) and maybe food.  All I need for my costume is my tie (borrowed from a guy friend), my choker (which can be borrowed too) and a guitar case which another friend is lending me.  I'm so excited!!  Eeeek.  I will be the best Nana ever.  Let's just hope someone knows who I am."

"event","Don't you just hate cold buildings?   Stupid UNL must keep the temp at like 67 degrees, which wouldn't be bad if I was running around outside or doing athletic-type things (HA!); but no, they put us in a class room for 4 hours straight and then crank up the AC perhaps in hope that it will keep our bodies and little minds from falling asleep.  Now, although I'm not sleepy, the only thing I can focus on is all these goosebumps.  I guess I could go for a hot...tea or something right about now.  Evil cold CBA building!  And the only thing I have with me to eat is a poptart (strawberry, yay!) or dried cranberries (yumm.....) both of which are in the class room with the remaining studious who don't give up on their quizzes as easily as I do apparently.  
So....Nothing interesting has happened lately, shocker though it may seem.  I did pass my first test that was Tuesday and got an 82.  I can deal with that.  Other college personel says, ""Why are you taking Cost Accounting?  I thought you were on Principles.""  The only thing I can say to that is....so did I.  Well, Cost will be that much easier for me and Intermediate will be a whole lot worse.  Oh it's just sad and pitiful.

Between all the women wanting to braid you hair (or in my case, give me some extensions cause it's too short now), the guys flirting shamelessly with any of the women who they think have money, and-if nothing else-the simple poverty of all the Jamaicans, wears on a person.  It's nice to be back in America where we can ignore the poor and go on with our on own lives like they don't exist.  (And FYI, I mean this in a sarcastic way, this is true but not good.)  
And I love my family, but....Doesn't everyone feel that way?  A whole week with them and all that.  So now I return to work, trying to pick cosplay outfits for friends, anticipation for my other summer class (and good luck, jenann!  It's nasty, I know.), and whatever it is I do normally.  Too bad that's so boring.  Maybe I'll go get my ears pierced or something."

I hate studying.  I've tried to care for the past 5 months and I don't think I can care anymore.  There are bigger things to life than knowing the equation for GDP, Dr. G!  I can't take anymore of MacroEconomics.  If I don't know it by now, I don't think I ever will!  Now, I will just hope for the best and just sort of wing it.  That idea makes me strangely happy.  Either that or maybe it's the Green Day.  Hm.  My mind is very blank, but I wanted to say alot.  Darn.  I found a funny website.

It's a group of like 5 people all hiding in one spot and you still can't find them.  You're the last person looking and hopefully they eventually take pity on you and just start chanting your name until you find them.  Also the people that hide really well are agrivating too.

"event","well folks have i got a story for you!  this past wednesday i was online and just out of curiosity i went into my gf's screen and started being nosey.  well i did not like what i found......a letter from some other girl saying she had a really good time chatting last night with my gf for 6 fucking hours!!!  well see i worked tuesday evening and while i was at work my gf was chatting online.

after work i went to my mom's house and i called over to my house to tell her that i was gonna be late.  she never answered.  needless to say that when i got home i saw the computer on and i looked at her screen and there was an im from someone, which turned out to be this same girl, i asked her about it and she was already asleep.  that's why i started snooping in the first place.  well i then proceeded to check her sent mail and my gf had written to this girl saying all kinds of shit like she would be thinking of her while she was lying next to me, and it's been only 5 min and i miss you already!!!   what the fuck kinda shit is that?????  well she was at work or rather had just gotten out and i went to pick up my son at daycare before she did......so i waited for her to get there......when she did i told her to give me the keys and she did.  i left her ass there at my son's daycare.  anyway she found a ride and came back to my house and i told her to fuck off!!!!  she sat outside for a few hours and then i let her in to get her shit!  when she came inside she was balling like crazy saying she didn't want to leave and i told her that was too fucking bad!  well in the end it doesn't really matter does it??  she is still here but it just hit me last night......the words she wrote i mean.  at first i was pissed and then wheni wasn't so pissed it hit me.......and i got sad and started crying because of what she said.  i was inbed last night and then my gf started crying saying that it was JUST online and it wasn't real and she loves me and is in love with me.....what do ya'll think is this a betrayal or what?  well i better go because i have to get ready for another day ay work.  thanks for listening to my ramblings."

"event","<P>Eventually got in contact with Mike, when he came online earlier, and we're still meeting up. Albeit it's a bit earlier than we arranged (10.00am!) but I haven't seen him since July last year so I hope have a great day! Of course we speak online whenever we can, but we haven't really sat down and had a laugh and a chat for ages!</P>
<P>He's going to let me drag him around&nbsp;town for the day, and in return, he's going to buy me lunch, just like he used to do when we were at college! </P>
<P><STRONG>Things I'm hoping to buy:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The three set collection of Doctor Who books, from W H Smith (Sad I know, but they really need to be on my bookshelf!)</LI>
<LI>A pair of shoes for Friday evening (Now I have money, I can get a nice pair)</LI>
<LI>Some clothes for Friday evening (Ditto the above!)</LI>
<LI>Some make up</LI></UL>
<P>Ah yes, Friday evening, I'm off out on a girly night out with a few mates of mine. Meeting at my main friend's mum's flat, having a few drinkies, then off down to the Social Club, staying there till 10.20ish then off down to Bogey's for about 10.30 cuz so we can get in free!</P>
<P><STRONG>Things to take with me on Friday:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Make up</LI>
<LI>Clothes for Bogey's</LI>
<LI>Clothes for the next day</LI>
<LI>Night clothes (as I'm staying at the flat)</LI>
<LI>Make up removers</LI>
<LI>Toothbrush / paste</LI>
<LI>Straighteners(?)</LI>

"event","<P>Full of this stupid cold still! I've put some Obus Oil on a tissue to help me breathe a bit better, and now my nose is full of gunk. I've been asked if I want to go out on Friday night, and stay at my mate Cassie's mum's flat for the night. Seeing as I don't have work the next the day, I've said I will go, as long as I have the time I need to get down to the flat etc. Plus I hope this cold has gone by then.</P>
<P>Currently trying to:</P>
<P>a) Get in touch with mate Mike, as we're supposed to be meeting up tomorrow afternoon</P>
<P>b) Concentrate on writing this, and not dancing to Madonna</P>
<P>c) Sort out money for tomorrow and Friday </P>
<P><STRONG>Phrase of the day:</STRONG> I'm ill </P>
<P><STRONG>Song of the day:</STRONG> Can't Get You Out Of My Bed... Sorry Head - Kylie Minogue </P>"

"event","<P>After a big talk with my dad about how going to bed early, going for a walk every so often can do you good, I took up his offer and went for a walk by myself this afternoon. I left the house about 20 past 3 and got home about 10 past 4. I took my mobile phone, some tissues,(as I have picked up yet another cold from work!) some money and my MP3 player and just walked for ages, until I did a full circle!</P>

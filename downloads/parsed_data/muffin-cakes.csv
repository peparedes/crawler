Even tho he kept throwing seaweed at me and they all were like trying to throw fish at me...what is that? Oh well...then Bree, Mike and Ant jumped off the pier...i didnt want anthony to go cuz he might have broken his pretty face,lmao! We went to Bree's hotel room, i washed my hair, and we left.

Moving on has been ALOT harder than what i said...but Ashley's advice has really helped putme in the right frame of mind. He was my 1st love...i guess i dont have room 2talk...i did break up with him...but there were so many reasons behind it tho. People like to jump to conclusions tho! W/e...its my life not theirs. I have come to realize that one of my main priorities is to see other people happy...I mean...i like 2 be happy, but its just not something i really focus on? hmm.. well enuff of this sadness...Nick came back :-D I was so happy seeing him today! Him and Ian...they r my best guy friends...they keep me leverl headed!

Well I think i realized things r gonna end soon..and rather than to drag it out and be unhappy, to just end it.I hope he soon sees why i did this...it was for the best, for both of us. Maybe next year..or during summer things will change, but this year...i dont think so. Im just going threw alot of things right now, and i need to be more focused on things...and honestly the feeling just wasnt there anymore, maybe it will comme back? But i dont want him to wait around for me...life doesnt work like that, he needs to go out and meet people, and such. I just dont want him to wait for me...that sounds so overly modist, but oh well. I just really care about him, and dont wanna hurt him, even tho i already did, but it wasnt intentional. Well today, Sarah and i didnt have a ride,lol. So we called Joseph, that kid rocks!! He came and got us...I really forgot how good our talks were. He is like my big brother or sumthin, hes such a sweetie! WEll im out!

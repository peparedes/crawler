<lj-cut text=""Stolen twice"">

01) Was 2006 a good year for you?
It was the peak of over 10 years of work and the first year I've actually had more than one friend in a while so yes! The best!

02) What was your favourite moment of the year?
This will take a while - Oxford phone call, Nat Schools (especially emotional after being dropped), any time spent with Caitlin or Wilkie or Serena or Celia, Oxbridge History classes, No Man's Land, Twelfth Night. That's all I can think of for now

People don't tend to lie to me that much, or maybe I'm being naive...

Probably - mainly parents, I give them way too much shit but they need to accept I have the right to be unhappy at times.

I got a call last night from Dr Jane Garnett from Wadham College Oxford who said that the letters were being really slow so she thought she would ring and say that I DO have a place AND it's for 2008 so I can take a gap year! Much celebration ensued. To cut a long story into a single number, my bedtime was at 4. Enough said ;)"

"event","Perhaps the title is a little dramatic, but that's certainly what Oxford interviews feel like. I leave early tomorrow to have two (maybe three) 20 minute interviews with a variety of people. My rational side says that I'll be fine and that there is very little in my special areas which I am totally ignorant of so it would be hard for the inquisitors to outflank me. But on the other hand, the nervous irrational side questions whether I am really good enough, or even if I am whether I can demonstrate that to strangers in such a short time. Hopefully I'll have calmed down after I actually arrive and realize that there is nothing I can do to effect the outcome other than do my best. It certainly feels like the most important two days of my life...

PS: Chris call me later and tell me how your interview went!"

Anyway, it will be better with an audience, MUCH better. A comedy with no audience = no laughs = sheer hell. So laugh god damn you Chris! 

Miss Pike is actually a legend - she said some people view the Oxford interview process as a chance to 'pull' (ie: get off with someone) but she said not to bring anyone to our room! And we were just like *blink* and then she said oh unless you're applying to Wadham in which case anything goes. I'm applying to Wadham ;)

I'm actually having loads of fun now, even though I am exhausted PLUS I get to hang out with my dad again tomorrow evening at a Constitutional Affairs Lecture which is awesome because he is officially the best dad ever. Although I only seem to have realised it recently..."

Life's still great and all, but I hate it when loads of crap happens at the same time and puts you in an obscene mood! Were other people's weekends better?"

"event","Well I'm not really angsting because I had a mammoth chat with Chris Roberts about the French Revolution and we literally covered every aspect I think it is possible to cover. No kidding. Not only did we discuss: social, economic, political, cultural, ideological, religious and military reasons for the changing nature of the French Revolution but we also discussed the links between the reasons AND the reasons behind the reasons. Now that's some serious causation! Plus there's nothing I can do to revise any more now, I have a firm grip on the historical skills required thus I am not concerned.

All I can do is say good luck to you Chris in your Bmat, I'm sure you'll be absolutely fine. I'm off to finish a little essay now so I wish you all a very happy Halloween!"

"event","WHEEEEE! *calms down* Well I officially had the best day of school ever today because of three things:

1) I got my Gladstone essay back and got 22/25 (no one I know has ever got 24 or 25) which was also the highest mark in the class even though I thought I'd done rubbish in it. PLUS I can apparently use it as an Oxford essay because it's good enough!

2) I read my reference which has been compiled by my teachers it's actually little sickening in it's praise. I won't bore you with the details but the last sentence scares/excites me: ""We see him as a high-flying candidate who will aim at a First in his degree and we have no doubts about recommending him very strongly."" (by the way for my American amigos you get an overall grade at the end of university, from worst to best: fail, 3rd, 2-2, 2-1 or a First) Another funny thing was that the guy who wrote it kept on dropping hints about me wanting to go to a 'challenging' university ie: Oxford.

3) You might remember I was really pissed off when I got my exam results from last year - I got a C in my French Revolution paper (59/90). Well I got it re-marked on the off-chance of it getting bumped up a little, possible to a B but it went up by 18 marks to 77/90 which means it's an A and I got 91% overall for history! No re-taking for me!!!

So I'm very very happy right now. Loads of stuff to get done (HAT in less than two days!) but at least I'll be happy while I do it now..."

"event","Well lat night was fun - met a whole bunch of new people, a couple old ones who I wanted to see and laughed at Dalton on the way home for missing his stop then almost hitting him when he tried to prevent me from getting of the train! 

But on a less fun note, Jesus relationships fuck people up! What are you meant to say to someone who's depressed and knows that all they can do is wait for the pain to go away? Churn out the cliches of ""stay strong"" ""time is the best healer"" and all that crap or just give them a hug and lie that everything will be ok? *shudder* That was a big mood killer.

On a different note, I don't know if other people get this, but has anyone ever felt that someone expected you to do something but you either had no idea what they wanted you to do or you didn't want to do it or you did but didn't know how to? I think there was one of those moments last night but then again it might not have been in which case trying to do it would have been a stupid idea. So, as usual I did nothing as opposed to taking a risk. *sigh* I just realised that will mean nothing to anyone (except possibly Chris but even then...)

Another thing that pissed me off for about five minutes before I got on with enjoying myself was a couple people who I really thought had more sense were smoking and trying to hang out with the 'cool' crowd. Some people really need to just accept who they are and not try to go for a 'cooler' image, because that just makes them look even more stupid.

I know that know I've not made it sound fun at all but it really was - being able to unplug for an evening is so refreshing, plus I have maintained my record of NO hangovers ever because I always drink responsibly :)

PS - on a sinister note, I need to talk to you Chris, you've probably already guessed what about, I'll ring you later and maybe cycle over at some point."

On an amazingly funny note, I've already been offered a place at Manchester university - Applications for all unis except for Oxford and Cambridge are in for December time so Manchester hasn't even got many applicants yet and they offered me a place about 4 months before they're meant to. I guess they want me pretty bad then! So on a bit of a high from that right now!

Need to go and read some historian who will inevitably be bashing postmodernists (I hate postmodernists so very, very much) which I always find amusing! Anyone else going on holiday soon?"

On a less academic note, saturday turned out to be amazing fun - I was at the Old City Arms (a public house for my American friends) and I was there with Johnny, and like 5 girls because no one knew that he was meant to be celebrating his birthday! So everyone was really angsting that no one else would come and everything would be very awkward... BUT Lena and I got on the phone and soon enough we had like 10 more people! And other people kept on coming and going so it turned out to be awesome. It was nice to be able to unwind for an evening and actually TALK to some people and remember that I'm not a total social delinquent ;) On a closing sinister note, Chris I'll talk to you tomorrow (or today depending on when you read this!)"

https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Instructions

You thought that you subconsiously weren't racist? Think again - still, it's a mark on society that we are bombarded with these connotations, not a personal reflection! No offense intended!!!

This was so scary, I was swearing at myself while I was doing it because I new what the results would be. Pretty damn annoying. *le sigh* The media sucks.

"event","Well most things have panned out according to plan: rowing is going quite well, I'm in another play, work is very challenging both in terms of time and conceptually, I got the senior scholarship which was awesome and unfortunately the thing which has suffered, as always, is my old social life. Hopefully when stuff eases up next term things will change but right now that's the one aspect of my life which still sucks.

On a less depressing note, mainly for the benefit of Chris, Katie B coxed one of the two  8's on saturday, she probably told you. It's so amusing actually rowing in a boat and constantly evaluating how good the cox is - don't repeat this but she was pretty rubbish. Steering was all right actually but not many calls although she is new to it so I guess it was ok - I have very high standards. Eugine wasn't much better, in fact the crap he was saying in the first race was worse than saying nothing XD (I switched boats half way through the outing) 

So a very painful, long outing yesterday when I pushed harder than I ever have before in a boat, mainly because I was being seat-raced. I have no idea whether I won or not, when I was in boat A it won, when I was in boat B boat A still won, although by much less. So maybe I did win... Anyway I'm really enjoying the rowing which makes up somewhat for anything else that might be lacking ;)"

There were already a whole bunch of them who have been scholars since the start of school because they wrote and passed the scholarship exams (which I didn't do because my French was RUBBISH!) but they just added a bunch of people, including me! I don't think I actually get anything except for the honour, it's just quite a nice prestigious little thing to get. So happiness ^_^ But now I have to write off a short German Nationalism essay sharpish! *end boasting session*"

University entrance is kicking off (and nearly finished), the essays are piling up, Oxford reading is getting intense and 12th Night is beginning to get going. And on that note I'm going bald. Seriously - I'll have hair like Friar Tuck, a C-shape around my head but totally bald on the top. So I have to go to Oxford interview looking insane ;) I guess it's what you might call a talking point...

But other than the business life is all right - we had a chat about happiness in politics today and what makes people happy and I reckon I'm all right. The most important things are apparently how mentally stable you are about your own situation in life and relationships with other people. The first is definitely fine, now if I could only spend more time with particular people number two would be sorted too! Serena if you're alive post, even if you post one word - I haven't heard anything from you in AGES! And everyone else post too to let me know you're alive - especially you Chris, what happened to you posting!?"

Yesterday I had circuits during lunch-break, a long outing after school then today I had a long outing in an eight, doing 2 10 minute pieces of work THEN heavy weights straight after. So tomorrow I'm going to break the world record for achiness!

On the plus side, I've really enjoyed it, I feel great and I'm only physically exhausted, not sleepy. Which means I have a fun day of exercise for the mind tomorrow! German Nationalism, Leninism, Gladestone and Liberalism will feature along with reading Twelfth Night ^_^

So about 300 pages or reading to read and note and at a rate of 20 pages per hour that's hmmm 15 hours of work to do. Plus I'm being set more all the time! And have tests. And essays. And Oxbridge application. *too many thoughts in my head* But it should cool down over this week and some sanity might return to my lair of darkness!

On an amusing note, the girl who called me cute in front of her boyfriend at the 3rd 8 celebration party was hanging around by the river Saturday night and asked for my number. Fun ;) *sigh* Too bad people keep asking me, but nothing ever comes of it!

Anyway off to write a suitably left-wing essay for my Neo-Marxist politics teacher. She's been accused of sprouting revolutionary communist propaganda by a visiting speaker before. Funny."

First performance complete, two to go. It went ok - I was pissed off at how many lines I garbled a bit though. Also I felt I lost too my control of the situation, although I guess I'm meant to... So mixed feelings about it. Williams (the director) loved it as did the rest of the cast so maybe I'm being too critical of myself. Anyway it's off to bed for me, I'm exhausted!"

"event","Well in 24 hours I will be about to finish off act one of No Man's Land. We've had a grand total of 10 days of rehearsal, but it's actually going really well now to my delight!  We had our derss today and it was by no means perfect, but it was a great platform - I wouldn't have been embarrassed to show what we produced tonight. Conclusion  - it's going to be difficult *not tempting fate* to make a complete arse out of myself tomorrow and the days after. I know the lines, I know the play, I know my character.

And on two minorly boasting notes (to explain why I'm in such a good mood!):
1) Yesterday I did this random poster for the Classical society, and the teacher in charge emailed my tutor to say how pleased he was with it!
2) Got my personal statement back today (the thing that gets sent to your prospective uni, so Oxford, and they read to decide if they want to interview you or not) and my tutor said it was one of the best he ever read ^_^ 

So the only thing I need now, is to perform well over the next three days, go to the cast party and find a lovely girl, we'll love each other at first sight and go dancing into the sunset together. Metaphorically. It would be dangerous doing that in real life, you'd burn to death in excruciating agony so not such a great plan."

Pros - get to spend more time with the lovely ladies from the Girl's School, get to be directed by arguably the best director in the school, win fame and fortune for myself (maybe, and if I get a half decent part!)

Cons - less rowing, more stress, harder work/'play' balance, less time for reading

So the predicted highlights of this term - 'No Man's Land' will hopefully be a success, History work will be harder but hopefully better from me, Oxford entrance will possibly be successful after a long uphill slog, rowing is going to be a laugh - finally I can put on muscle weight and turn into a walking tank ;) Last but not least, going out more! That will be heaven, pure delight - I've put it off for far too long but now seems like as good a time as any to start and not look back...

"event","I just completed my 89km over 4 days. And I'm not kidding, my whole appreciating of life has changed. Toilets, baths, food, a roof, solid ground, clothes, soap all seem like luxuries! Over the 4 days I have fulfilled the roles of: 

navigator - no one else did jack because they were too tired. humph
nurse - binding ankles, applying blister plasters and trying to fix my own pussing back sore. Yes, very eww
motivator - well this isn't new to me ;) But seriously, if I hadn't been there the group would have slept in a ditch for about 3 hours they were so exhausted!
cook - at 6am it was me making the hot chocolate
comedian - the jokes were rubbish but everyone was too tired to care
singer - this other guy and me literally sung every song invented. We got really sore throats and almost lost our voices ;)

This sounds bad but I loved every minute of it. I guess I like leadership and responsibility. But I'm strange like that! I get a kick out of this kind of thing, and even though I lost 3kg (in FOUR days, but I'm still 61kgs, don't get excited about coxing Chris) and my feet are killing, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 

Photos to follow. Most of the people photos have people looking depressed. The guy grinning stupidly was behind the camera ;)

In one sense it will be great - the walking will be amazing, challenging, stimulating in he physical sense. Even if it pours with rain it will still be character-building and will generate some funny stories. 

On the other hand I do have to put up with one guy who I hate. He has absolutely no idea of how to walk. At all. He went one day without eating anything for FOUR HOURS. Then he got tired and started complaining. And the second his feet start hurting he slows down to slower than tortoise speed whereas the rest of us are walking through the mild pain. So in that sense it could be a real bummer, but once again, being forced to cope with people who irritate you might be character building. Or it might just be an opportunity to force him into doing what everyone else does and that might actually make him (and us!) happier. Pictures and a post will follow on saturday! Until then..."

"event","Well I woke up at 6 am this morning, shot up (naturally) with adrenaline, sprinted downstairs, and checked my email - the results have arrived...

I'll take it subject by subject - it may be boring for you, but I want to so I'm going to!

Firstly just so that my American friends know what the hell this means, I'll give you a bit about the marking system. You get grades (A, B, C etc) depending on your marks, and NORMALLY these marks wouldn't really matter, but because I'm applying to Oxford, and my school's a little special, we get the marks too. 80%+ is considered very good, an A, anything approaching 90 is excellent and anything 90+ is very very good. So, on with the results

Ancient History - A 
Unit One - 87/100
Unit Two - 100/100 - OMG YAY! I remember this paper, it was a nice question about the Athenian General Perikles, and my teacher read it and said how much he liked it, and the examiner obviously liked it too!
Unit Three - 88/100

So overall 92% - very happy with that one!

Politics - A
Unit One - 96/100
Unit Two - 100/100
Unit Three - 95/100

This has actually really annoyed me - this is by far the best result! 97% and it makes me question whether or not I should apply for History AND Politics... *sigh* but I'm very very pleased with this one - this will be the paper I can show off!

History - A
Unit One - 79/90
Unit Two - 59/90
Unit Three - 118/120
Unit Two sucked - that was a French Revolution paper, and apparently everyone totally messed up that question, or (more likely) the examiner was off his/her head. Last year the same thing happened - literally on of the most intelligent people in the country got about the same as me for that paper. The school's requesting it and probably getting it remarked. BUT I still got an overall A and 85% and hopefully in my reference the writer can say - almost full marks in US Civil War Paper and leave it at that! I am still very annoyed about this one, it's the only thing that spoilt the moment...

Theatre Studies - A
Unit One - 106/120
Unit Two 90/90
Unit Three 72/90
So 89% and one full marks! Plus all 5 people in my Theatre class got A's which is great for the department as it's very small. And another full marks! This was my only non-serious subject and it was fine so I'm happy!

Conclusion - Overall I'm very pleased, but the History is annoying me. I pray that all Oxford will see is the shiny A as opposed to high A, C, very high A for the modules. I've asked my history teacher about it and I shall post the reply..."

"event","So the countdown continues!

But on a less boring (for you!) note, two little bits of amusing news. Firstly I did meet the the 16-year-old model the other day, yes she was beautiful, but no she didn't conform to the stereotype. She was very quiet, but also laughed a lot and apparently is a literary buff. Unfortunately we spent only about an hour talking until she had to go to a modeling interview... But who knows, if she ever comes to London...

More realistically (and to Serena's delight I'm sure) I am going to see a movie with *seduction voice* Vicky. Although as friends. So tease all you want! I am immune!

One closing piece of advice - never get the part in a play with the most lines, go for the slightly smaller part, but which makes just as much impact. Speaking for 30 minutes, almost straight is not the most fun in the world...

""In fact, you are kindness itself, probably always are kindness itself, now, and in England, and in Hampstead, and for all eternity.""

""I would say, albeit on a brief acquaintance, that you lack the essential quality of manliness, which is to put your money where your mouth is, to pick up a pintpot and know it to be a pintpot, and knowing it to be a pintpot to declare it a pintpot and to be faithful to that pintpot as though you had given to it out of your own arse.""

Yes be disturbed."

Two incidents of note - we went ot the suspension bridge in Vancouver yesterday and one of the girls who worked for the cafe flirted with me IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. It was flattering, but afterwards it was uber embarrassing because my mum said 'she was flirting with you' and then i blushed.

Second one ""Thanks again for your hijacking article - it is indeed painfully relevant. It is also, by the way, beautifully written."" That made me very happy.

Other news, I might be having a picnic with *deep breath* the daughter of my mum's friend's sister, who happens to be a model. It will be very interesting to see if she conforms to the stereotype... Then Thursday (to celebrate and so that my dad can review it) we're going to West, which is apparently the best restaurant in Vancouver for champagne and amazing food.

Oh and finally, another little extract from my play (I'm Spooner)

""Spooner: My mother remains, I have to say, a terribly attractive woman in many ways. Her buns are the best.

(Hirst looks at him)

Spooner: Her current buns. The best.""

"event","I've been fairly busy over the last few days, ploughing forward with my reading for Oxford. One book took 150 pages to explain the religious (and heretical) views of a 16th century miller and where he got his ideas from. It sounds tedious but it was very revealing about how coherent the peasants of that time were. Communist China and 19th century Britain have appeared too (I'm very excited about one long essay I'm going to write over the next few months - it follows a radically new line of thought that no one has ever really pursued!), as well as the political theory of John Stuart Mill. If ever you want to read some 19th century political theory in which the ideas seem unsettlingly applicable for today, read Mill's 'On Liberty'. 

But that's enough of the academic stuff. I've been eating out almost every night because my Dad's writing a guidebook, I've been biking a fair bit and seeing a few movies. Little Miss Sunshine is great - anyone who liked Napoleon Dynamite would love this. I don't know why, but I almost cried at the end - and I NEVER cry during movies, and not much normally. It wasn't a sad moment at all, it was hilarious but very touching. If you want to see something that will depress you about the UN and global politics in general see Shooting Dogs. It's about the Rwanda genocide and it is a startling eye-opener. Most definitely NOT a date movie or for anyone of a nervous disposition.

And finally the Nerves. Big exam results in 8 days time. I am petrified. It may be totally irrational, people keep on saying 'oh you'll be fine' and I hope that's true but it doesn't stop the fear that I will have messed up something. It's never happened before, but that would only make it worse if I did it now... Plus Oxford chances would be torn to shreds if I slipped up in something. But, there's nothing I can do about it now so I guess I just have to wait for the day of reckoning and try to stay positive! Hope everyone's enjoying the last days of summer..."

Rules: if you're tagged you must list 6 random facts about yourself - 3 true and 3 false, so people can guess which are which. Then tag 6 people to do this same.

So:

1) The initials of an old teacher of mine are CRAP

2) I was once involved in a minor road accident on my bike

3) I have never been drunk

4) In my travels this summer I have been carrying around more than 10 books

5) I hate sushi

6) My nightmare death is falling from a mile-high building and having to wait a while before I hit the ground...

And I tag: <lj user=""justmorebadnews"">, <lj user=""londontiger"">, <lj user=""misslorelei""> and I DOUBLE tag, because I don't have any more friends on my list :( <lj user=""shinystars"">, <lj user=""arynna""> and <lj user=""ironchef127"">"

"event","For future reference, when I curse the play I'm in, it's Harold Pinter's No Man's Land and, if you know it or are interested, my character is called Spooner (funny name, I know) A.K.A. the character on stage for the whole 2 hour duration of the play with an absolute shed load of lines. Great chance to show off, but also a real pain.

So I've just learnt 4 pages. It took me an hour. Considering I've got 60+ to learn, it's a nightmare. A few examples of the type of line:

My only security, my true comfort and solace, rests in the confirmation that I elicit from people of all kinds a common and constant level of indifference.

and

It takes a man of intelligence and perception to stick a needle through that posture and discern the essential flabbiness of the stance.

As you might have guessed my character likes language. Which makes learning everything I say much, much harder. Oh and the best part - I'm complaining having learnt 4 pages, where I am speaking for most of the page. Near the end of the play I have a four page solid monologue. I can tell this is going to be a fun 2 weeks...

More photos to follow soon! And I might be seeing the Phantom soon here in Vancouver! Finally if anyone else is having a tough time with lines/work or has anything to say about the Thespian art do tell..."

"event","Now that I'm in Vancouver, my pre-Oxford interview reading splurge has begun and so I am allowing myself this one day of negative thinking. Therefore I present you with my only two negative thoughouts, followed by pictures of flowers.

Number One - in relation to climate change and the world.

It is impossible for everyone in the world to live like westerners. I am the first to talk about climate change and responsibility to the 'greater good' (no communist innuendo intended!) but at the end of the day, there is a small part inside me that wants to make enough money to be comfortable, marry and bring up children in a stable environment with all the perks that we currently enjoy. When it comes down to it could I make the sacrifice? And more to the point, is any politician ever going to be able to stand up and say - if we don't take serious, life-changing action now, your descendants will suffer extraordinary levels of suffering before the human race is wiped out?

Number Two - in relation to me and my small time on this planet.

I married books, the Boat House and Theatrics four years ago. All three have been cold mistresses who never allow anyone else in.

<lj-cut text=""And now for something completely different... pictures of the Butchart Gardens to cheer myself up!"">

Onto the flowers! Feel free to steal any of the pictures if you want to. I'm afraid I have no idea what I've actually taken pictures of, but maybe some of you guys know?

*EDIT* I've now made icons too!

And I don't care what you say Chris, alcohol will be involved ;-) Really I'll be relieved after wednesday because then I'll be finished everything except for Theater Studies which is piss easy. Literally, no effort or revision, have never got lower than an A, and a high A at that! I think I'm ready, I can rant on about most of msy subjects for AGES and that's a good indication that I've revised enough. Just doing a couple bits and pieces to tidy up my subconcious. Ancient History will be fine, all about the technique for one paper, another you can be SOOO vague, not that I will, but it's a nice safety net and the middle one needs to be covered in more depth but I've read a great book for that so it should be fine. Peel will rock ass, French revolution might be a nightmare but I doubt it, US Civil war is a piece of piss, all technique again. Politics will be lots of factual stuff and that's the one which COULD go wrong, but won't because I've done enough work (I think). Plus I did well in the mocks... So feeling ok now. My cramming went well! Good luck Wilkie, you'll be fine too I'm sure!"

"event","Yup, we won silver at Nat Schools after less than 3 weeks of training, beating Hampton who spanked the 3rd VIII at School's Head AND Shrewsbury whose First 8 won the Champ 8's event. It was also fairly ironic that we were the only senior crew to pick up a medal on the day! Briefly we had two races:

1) Semi-final vs Shrew and Bedford. Crap start, down a couple seats at 250. By the 750 mark we had a length on Shrew and Bedford had half a length on us. I called a second stride, we took it down to 30/31 and relaxed for the rest of the race. The distance between Shrew and us increased gradually AND Bedford were working their nuts off to stay ahead of us even though we were relaxed at 2nd (ie: qualifying position). At the 250 to go mark we were only a canvas down having put down minimal pressure down for the whole race. I called a push to get 1st place, we got through Bedford in about 10 strokes, then got almost a length clear water in 20 strokes. We took the pressure down again before the line and kept on going right into the landing stages whislt watching Bedford puking into the lake ^_^

2) Final vs Eton, Hampton, Bedford and someone else crap. Better start but even better after the 250 mark. We didn't really stride at all, we just gunned it right the way down the course, so that by 1k gone we were almost a length ahead of the whole field. Joy - so good, we literally controlled the race. Kept on going like that to the 500 to go mark, shitting on everyone except for Eton who were inching up on us. Called a big rhythm chance at the 500 to resist Eton's push, sort of worked, held them for about another 15 strokes then they started moving. Called hammer time a little earlier than normal to hold Eton's big finish, but there was no juice left in the tank, rating was at 38, still not enough to resist Eton's speed. They won by about 1/2 a length. BUT we beat Hampton by clear water AND everyone else by about 3+ lengths. And Eton and the rest of them had obviously trained a fair bit so who knows, another week or two of decent work and we might have won.

Conclusion - everyone was happy, Pinsent gave us our medals, had a laugh at the Old City, therefore good day. Especially because I had massive fears at the start of the day that we were going to get shat on. Guess I was too used to 1st 8 standard! Got to feel gutted for the 1st 8 though - at Wallingford before I was dropped, we lost to Shrew but an inch or two, at Nat School's it was 15 seconds and 5th position overall. In a way it's better that I was dropped! Cheers for a great race Wilkie."

"event","I'm posting this so that I can get over it all - this has been my moping week, but I will come back on Monday with a light heart, determined to carry out what needs to be done (ie: work the third eight to the bone, cane my AS levels so I can get into Oxford and enjoy my birthday).

So day-to-day:

Monday - devised piece for theater studies. It went quite well, made a couple of tiny mistakes but I thought it had gone ok. Turns out from my perspective, it didn't. I got the lowest performance mark by 4/50. I actually got 45/50 which is still very good, but the fact that it was worse than people who no one rates to be good at acting was pissing off. Plus my portfolio which I had been told was outstanding by Mr Williams got a B - 19/25. Why? Because he had failed to tell us about a massive section which we needed to include. ie - his fault. So in the end I got 88/100 which is a high A and will probably be bumped up to 100 after its been UMSed. But still, the confirmation that I cannot act any more sucked.

Tuesday - oh dear. The big one. In morning break went and got weighed by Doc. 59kgs. I was shitting myself. Got on with the day, met Doc at the end of lunchbreak. Got dropped. The thing that really gets me is that in his words, I'm still the best cox in the boast house, but because I grew too much I can't take the 1st 8 to victory at Henley. Oh yes, they will win. That feeling was terrible. At the very moment I, and other people thought I'd made real improvements and even might have got into GB (according to Doc), I find that I can't do it anymore. 4 years cut out from underneath me in the space of about 10 minutes. Yes I will work the 3rd Eight hard, and yes it will be great if we win and I feel great because I know that I will have had a direct effect on their performance. Still, it's not really the same as the 1st 8 is it? Macenzie was great, like I said in the previous post and she made me feel better in the short term but the fact that she said that she would have kept me in the boat because what I say would reduce the time really stings me now. I totally support Doc's decision, and wouldn't have it any other way, but it still bites.

Wednesday - outing with the third 8 and the realisation that I will probably never get to cox a top-notch boat again. And that tuesday morning and BASH were my last ever outings with the first 8. It was nice how people were sympathetic, but some people saying I was dropped because I was fat really really pissed me off. My fat % is actually just above the unhealthy level for my age.

Thursday - more of the same, the irony that I have 1st 8 colours and can wear the blazer hit home. And the erg pissed me off - even though I got a PB it shows how far behind everyone else I am, and how much I need to improve to make a go of 2nd 8 next year.

Friday - didn't become a prefect. Not the end of the world, but it would have been really nice. And Michael Marks is. God that kid pisses me off. Such a bloody Tory and a career builder - he does nothing because it really interests him, he just wants to get into Oxford and get the degree so he can boast more.

Saturday - don't get me wrong when I say this Chris because I'm really glad that you've found someone. But it did being home how bloody inactive I've been for the past 4 years. How many opportunities to have fun I wasted. And you looked so happy too. Sure I was jealous, not specifically of you and her, but of the situation in general. But I guess it's on my back. I know that the rowing wasn't a waste of time, it just that now I can see the end of it, I regret not spending more time socialising. I need my gap year. But I also question what I'm going to do next year - rowing has been such a huge part of my life, I wonder what I'm going to do with myself! I can't cox, rowing itself would be bloody difficult, if not impossible for me. The one glimmer of hope which I hold, which I might discuss with Doc would be to do some coaching. I know that sounds so cocky, but all the coach of some of the younger years needs to be is organized, have a good routine, and know a decent amount about the rowing stroke and how to convey that to other people. So I might try to do that. COuld even go for the ARA bronze coaching thingy. That would be so cool - certified ARA rowing coach. 

Conclusion - my week has been character building! I'm moving on and it feels good to have written it all down. It's good I have stuff to focus my mind coming up - exams and 3rd 8. I just pray I don't fuck up my AS levels. I'm sure I won't, just I'm a bit worried about one French Revolution paper... Oh well, back to the books I go now! Anyone else had shit happen to them in their week? Hearing about some trivial stuff would be nice!"

"event","Well it kind of sucks. Ok I REALLY sucks - I got dropped. Not because of ability, but because of weight. And again, not because I couldn't get down to 55, but because it would restrict my performance at school and as my tutor he correctly asserted that Oxford was more important than rowing. So I totally understand. Still it sucks to be dropped when we're about to win Nat Schools and Henley. So I was upset, Doc was kind, Macenzie was amazing although I guessed she would be as a rower who got dropped from the Olympic squad... As she said, I can have tonight of being upset, but then I have to move on and get on with my new project...

THE THIRD EIGHT! Ted's going stay coxing the 2nd eight because they're used to him, Amar approaching 55 now so he's going to do it. As for me, the third 8 pass into my hands ;-) Thus I'm going to make you AMAZING and win Nat Schools. So Chris, get ready for the toughest three weeks of training you've experienced in your career so far! I'll talk to all of you tomorrow during the games half to sort our training for the next period. I'm actually really looking forward to it, because I KNOW that we can do it. Ironic that I got first 8 colours today, so I can now wear the blazer and am a member of the Colet Boat club. On a final note Doc told me about a Radley cox in my position who came back the next year and rowed in the 1st eight. Rowing here we come!"

"event","Doc banging on for about half an hour on how crap the Thames is to row on was depressing, indicating that we'd lost already. I really felt like slapping him and saying THIS IS NOT HELPING. But then I would have been fucked by the school. So I didn't. On the way home I was in an odd mood - thinking about how strange it is that everyone in the world has their own lives. I know it sounds weird but imagine - over 6 billion people with as complex emotions and as detailed a life as you. I does boggle the mind. I do occasionally step back and marvel at how complex and extensive our society has become. Whether or not this is a good thing is a boring question which I am not going to tire your eyes with. I have 3 essays to write for tomorrow, one test and one set of reading. Wish me luck. 

Few minor things - Doc said you looked impressive today Wilkie, as in the 3rd 8, not you specifically! For everyone else give me words of comfort as I think this may well turn into an all-nighter. *shudder* and it's only the second day of term >_<"

We got 6.10 for a 2k at rate 26-30 (gradually increasing) but we reckon the course was a little longer than that. SO the 8's going ok, not great YET. As soon as we find our strokeman we'll be in the money. Apparently Lena fucked up the Paulina TWICE in the same place almost back-to-back in terms of outings. Silly girl. Still want her as a cox Wilkie? Work's gone well, just need to tighten up a few areas and I'll be sorted. It's more homework that I'm worried about! Looking forward to school in strange kind of way, especially to our Devised piece next Thursday and friday.

PS Serena if you check this - do you want to go to the theater on friday? Promise it will be AMAZING, we'd see two sort plays called chatroom and citizenship. I've seen chatroom and it was the best piece of theater I've seen all year (and that's saying something considering I've been to about 20 plays) but citizenship's meant to be even better!

"event","Hey hey all!
End of term FINALLY. But now revision starts. But in a strange way I'm really looking forward to it, whilst I have the mundane stuff to do, I also have a couple of new books on the topics concerned which I know I'm going to love. Plus Snowdonia is beautiful. Just a couple of things to say to individuals before I go:

Serena - could I have the dates when you're going to be here please and any requests for your birthday (if your Dad's got them ^_-)
Chris - lets go see something when we're both in London, not V for Vendetta though, unless you like it enough to see it again...
Simon - can we have a chat at some point about Oxford colleges please and maybe if at any point in the next 3 weeks your in Oxford I could take a day trip? Cheers all! Have a great easter!

PS Because I'll be in WALES I may not be able to get internet connection. But I may hear you zooming overhead Simon ;-)"

"event","Mini to-do list for me before the end of term:

Write about a quarter of History notes on one topic for the exam
Revise bloody hard for a history test to show I am capable of great things
Write an Ancient History Essay for Mr Lambert
Write an Ancient History Essay for Mr Cairns
Politics Essay
Rehearse my balls off for my devised piece
Write Theater Studies Coursework
Measure up Drama Studio for set
Ring up to try to rent a boxing ring (don't ask)
Turn up to any rowing session
Sleep
Survive

Not too much then for less than 2 full days! I may not do both of the Ancient History Essays, since I have enough credibility with Cairns to get off with a chuckle and a 'you rasckle' in a scottish accent... Going to get on with it now!"

check out number 59 ;-) Beating every other school crew, coming 3rd in our category and only loosing to two top uni crews is not bad (so we get medals WOOOOP!). Play went ok too and drinking at Matt's house was hilarious (rather, laughing at how badly Max was playing poker, thus how much he was drinking and even more so because I didn;t have a hangover). But now work is piling up, might be on AOL/MSN later though for a bit... Hope everyone else's had a good weekend..."

He will fill your life and your heart with joy and peace if you'll let Him.  His word is true, He cannot lie, and because of Him my soul won't die!  To God be all glory, honor, and praise.  Bless the name of the Lord!

Well, it's time to update my journal.  I am not sure the last time I entered anything in here, but it sure has been a while.  Last week I went to Oklahoma, which was pretty great.  My friend Nathan and I drove all the way out there.  It took us 24 hours on the way back.  That's quite a bit of driving.  While there I had some good ol' country fun.  I wrestled a goat, rode a horse, shot stuff, and went to camp meeting! 

Camp meeting was nice.  I was able to just worship the Lord, without actually being a part of the worship ministry.  Typically I play drums, lead worship, or praise sing during service, so this opportunity to just worship the Lord amongst the congregation was refreshing.  Thank the Lord for the opportunity to be a part of those that lead worship, but thank Him as well for the opportunity to just praise Him.  

Sunday night, the 24th, I messed up.  I, in all my excitement about my trip and my rushing to get packed and on the road, forgot to call a very special person and wish them happy birthday.  Now, this wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't let this person down several times in the past, but I have.  I knew I had messed up.  I don't really know what to do to make it up to them, or to make ammends, but I'll work on it.  If you have any suggestions you can post them in your reply.  I may need something big.  I would like to make things right though.  

Praise the Lord, for He is good!  His mercy endures forever!  Jesus is life, hope you're living.

Yesterday I sat around all day and watched T.V....well, really I lay there, not too much sitting.  Anyway...it was a waste of a day.  Today was not as bad though, I did spend some time doing what I needed to do.  

Now my mom is sick also.  She has bronchitis.

"event","God is good.  He answers prayers!  So many things enter my mind, stay a minute, then leave and make room for the next thought.  Most of these thoughts wouldn't make real interesting reading, so I won't burden your eyes, your mind, or your time with them.  

Although, I will give you an example of how God answers prayers.  My mom lost her job last week.  She had not been happy at this job for some time.  When she lost it, I didn't panic, I just prayed that God would just give her the right job.  She interviewed for a postion yesterday and an offer was made the same day.  At this new job she does not have to drive anywhere near the miles that she had been, she makes more than she was making hourly+commission at her previous job, and she gets to sell things that she loves to sell.  God is good.  To top all this off, her new boss is a believer in Christ and doesn't open his store on Sunday, so my mom can go to church with me every weekend.  Glory be to God!  He CAN be trusted.  He has been proved over and over and over again.  

May God bless all who read this.

I have had people over for the past three nights.  Tonight they've left early, which means I get sleep...which has not been the case the past couple of nights.  Company is nice.  Being alone is nice as well.  You're never really alone though, there's always someone watching.  If God and the angels are always around, then someone is always witnessing the stupid things you do in front of the mirror or the crazy way you dance when you think no one is watching.  

There were two kids over tonight, Anya and Bubba.  I hope my kids are that cool.

So what's new?  Let me see.  I'm starting to focus a little more on application stuff lately.  I don't know whether I'm going to W&M or UVA yet.  Maybe God has another plan for me.  Maybe in the end I'll go to neither.  I don't really know, He will have to shut the doors, or open my heart and eyes to what it is exactly that He wants me to do.  All I can do is pray about it and plan.  I would ask all who read this, whether one or several, to pray with me about it.  

School is steady.  I need to be studying now.  I will get there in a moment.  I might as well write in here right now.  

Personal stuff...yep...that will remain personal for now.

"event","Hey there.  Well, I am tired again, but I will endeavor to post at the request of my dear friendly banana lady.  So, life has been pretty lively lately.  That's funny...life has been lively.  Well, I guess it's not really that funny.  No, life has been pretty swell here lately.  I'll just talk about the past week, beginning with Saturday.  On Saturday I went to the Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns and Chris Tomlin concert.  It was pretty awesome.  I like the worship.  Worship is good.  I like to be moved.  God is so good.  The more that you are able to realize about God, the less you know.  The more that you're able to believe, the more unbelievable He becomes. 

Monday I had a great long conversation with Anna that started at lunch, and pretty much ended at about 11 that night.  There were highs and lows in the convo.  The good stuff took place at the school and then the best stuff took place while we at panera bread (there for quite a while).  Awesome.  

Tuesday, Wednesday...yada yada...nothing comes to mind. 

Thursday we did the normal hang out thing and ate at Chili's.  We then rented Monty Python and the holy grail.  Funny movie at several places...I think it's probably more fun to talk about and joke about though.  Then, after you joke about it enough, watching it again would be hilarious.  One of those movies I think.  

Friday, again I was with Anna for a lot of the day.  I spend a lot of time with her.  Again we had a couple of pretty good conversations.  We played taboo that night and beasted on my sister and her friend...well...we won by three.  Anyway...so here I am.  It's Sunday morning at 1am.  I've spent a lot of afternoon and evening working on homework and I'm getting ready for my exams next week.  Later today shall be church.  I don't have class in the morning which is cool because now I can get some sleep, because I don't have to be there so early.  Anyway, I will write again soon.  

Much love to all my family, friends, and brethren.  BUT! May my heart belong to Jesus.

It's kind of a confusing time in my world right now.  Tell me what's going on inside of me, I despise my own behavior.  Thanks for the quote DCTalk.  I do despise my own behavior, but anyway, that doesn't explain very well the inner-workings of my existence right now.  Different variables pull me in different ways.  Sometimes it could seem as if I was on a compass, being pulled in 4 different directions.  My head is one place, my feet in another, my hands working in different things.  May God give me grace to sort out the mess.  I put my trust in Him, He is the Wonderful Counselor.  He will guide me always."

"event","Why is it that the Man is given to presumption?  Confusion that is caused by poor presumptions and the grief that follows--almost unbearable.  

Isn't it amazing the way our mind builds a world that does not exist?  We think, therefore we know, but in truth we only think we know.  

Actions speak louder than words...or do they?

Someone walks by without stopping to say hello to me.  They didn't see me, but in my mind I've become their worst enemy.  They're avoiding me.  They don't like me anymore.  Does this one despise me?  No.  We drag ourselves through the pain and agony of rejection when rejection does not exist.  We build up walls to protect the place our heart resides.  We build up defenses against an enemy of fiction.  We take comfort in our Lord and determine to excommunicate all others who may breach the ""threatened"" territory.  Why?  Sadly, it's the Human Condition.  

Oh, that we were all transparent at times, thereby ending the constant confusion provoked by mystery.  Life may be more boring that way, but at least the kingdoms built from blocks of believed fiction would be torn down and people would be free to enjoy the gifts given to them by their Heavenly Father to enjoy.  Love, Joy, Peace, Faith, Hope, but especially love.   

Why do we continually provoke ourselves to this place?  It's the Human Condition.  Give me liberty from this condition O'Lord; set me free from my own mind.  

May my will 
be yours 
and my heart 
the same.  
My life belongs to you take 
and bring glory your Name.  

I love you."

"event","I stayed up until like 6:30-7 this morning woo hoo!  A lot of things happened last night.  First I went to a youth rally in Chesapeake that was purty good, then I came home and did some stuff.  After a while I went and shot pool at AMF with my amigos.  After pool we went to the beach.  Then, I took Anna home...always a pleasure.  After I dropped her off I went and chilled at the J-fairie's house with maggie, emilia, ari, and sarah.  We played cards for a while and then went to IHOP, where I visited my girl Cholula...I found out she's been hanging out with a dirty rotten brotha named Heinz.  I guess she likes him because he's rich.  He does own a ketchup company.  She broke my heart.  Maybe it's for the best though...she is like 30 something...plus she doesn't speak very well english.  

Moving along...

I reckon I'll leave the rest alone for now.

"event","Well, today was pretty a pretty good day.  I went to school and was trying to get stuff ready for the SGA meeting before work, and my co-worker (who doesn't typically come in on Thursdays) showed up.  Sweet!  There was a whole lot less stress than any meeting before, at least on the preparation end.  There was quite a bit of tension with a certain club that requested funding and was not awarded because of their failure to follow certain procedures.  Yada Yada...but who cares about that?  

I should go to bed soon.  I hoola hooped today, woo hoo!  Also, I hung out with the banana lady for a while and we created a masterpiece together.  Then  we went to a birthday party followed by the beach, other people were also at the beach.  Then, we went to IHOP and Mr. Wilson paid!  Then we drove back to the b-day girls house...and I took the banana back to the barn.  Her Hen probably plucked her nerves when she got home.  ""EHHHSTTTTAAAAAH!  Where have you BEEN!  Do you know what time it is?  

I told the banana lady that I wasn't really tired of her, because I'm not.  She may be of me though.  I told her that I was tired of her at dinner.  I'm getting extremely tired, byecycle!

"event","Well, Sunday was a great day.  Church was really good today.  I started on a good note by oversleeping.  Now, you may be asking yourself, ""How is that a good note?""  Hang on, I'll tell you.  I would have been very tired at church today, therefore possibly irritable, unfocused, and ready to leave when I got there.  BUT! That was not the case today.  I got a couple of sausage biscuits and a cup of coffee at the church kitchen (I'm glad they take IOU's because I had no cash).  I sat down and got ready for the lesson at hand, and boy did my pastor do a good job.  I could feel my bones getting fat (if you don't know what that means, look  in the scripture).  It really truly blessed my soul.  The word of God is great and it really increases effectiveness when you've got an able teacher to share some of that good word with you.  Moving along...

Church continued in the same fashion as S.S., it was phenomenal.  As I told my dear banana friend, I felt so good, so much joy that it makes you want to run around in circles.  God is so good, and if you didn't know, now you know.  Take my word for it...or better yet, find out for yourself!  I need and want to know Him so much more.  Sometimes my actions don't agree with my desires though.  I DO want to know Him more, but what do I do to draw nigh to Him?  Not much.  May He grant me grace to live for Him better and know Him more.  

After service in the morning I talked politics with my pastor for a while.  I eventually left the church and came to my house, where my sister was close to finishing the food she was making.  It was pretty tasty stuff.  With the rest of my time before music practice (maybe 45 minutes) I played guitar.  Then I went to practice and was early (YES!), which is not typical.  I'm usually not early anywhere.  Practice was fun.  While the band was trying to work on learning a song (I've been singing on Sunday nights so some of the other drummers can get some experience) I was doing different dances with my sis.  My favorite today seemed to be the heel-toe.    We were acting crazy.  My sister and I sounded tight when we sang together.  Listen to the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas CD and you'll get some idea of what was going on.  Chipmunk is a pretty funny word...think about it.  

Service was good.  I was a little more tired this time though.  

After service I came home and played guitar a little bit, ate, talked to my friendly neighborhood banana, and ended up going out.  Ari, Anna, and I went to the beach and hung out.  There was like NO ONE there.  It was fun though.  I spent a lot of time on the phone with no one.  It's amazing how good of a conversation you can have with no one.  

Well, I think I've written enough for tonight.  Time to get ready and go to bed.  

To my Lord Jesus, I love you.  

To my friends, sisters, and brothers, you know who you are, I love you all very much.  God bless you and keep you night and day all week.  Im starting to get really tired so I better go before I bust my laptop with my head.  I do have a pretty big head.

"event","Well, today was a pretty good day.  I woke up this morning and got some cheerios for breakfast.  I texted the banana lady and confirmed that we were dressing formal for the party that night.  Then, I drove to the church planning on doing some work there, and I found out that I didn't need to do anything, which is always nice.  As I was driving out of the parking lot, unshaven, unshowered, still wearing the same clothes from the night before, the people going to the nursing home were pulling into the parking lot.  The first one that stopped to talk to me didn't lay on the conviction to my statement that I wasn't going to go to nursing home that day because I was pretty messed up looking(or something like that).  The second car was not as willing to let me slide by.  She proclaimed that they just wanted me there and that it was from the heart what I would be doing.  What do you say to that???  So...I gave in.  I did go home and take a shower though.  No matter how much I may have wanted to get out of going, I felt better afterward, which is generally always the case.  Then I came home and did some other things, among which was falling asleep on the floor (didn't get much last night).  I picked up the banana lady for the party and she looked very nice.  I don't think I told her that.  The party was good.  I think the most fun that I had was playing with the little people who were there at the party.  They started ganging up on me and hitting me with balloon swords, then they convinced the banana lady to turn against me.  Praise and worship was also good.  

Then I drove the banana lady home...The end...time to go to bed because I've stayed up way too late...once again!  Another burning eyed, weak bodied Sunday.  These are getting to be really a whole lot of not good (that's a little grammar going out to the only one who reads this thing...you know who you are).  

To my Lord, I love you.  

To my friends, brothers, and sisters (you know who you are) ain't got nothin but love fo ya!  Peace to you.  God be with you on this fine, fine Sunday.

"event","UMMM...today was a day that gradually got better.  When I woke up this morning I really felt bad.  I woke up feeling kind of heavy...not like I weigh 400 pounds heavy, but heavy in spirit or heart.  I felt stressed out.  Then I went to the school where we were having an ""autumn festival.""  That was ok.  I didn't really even want to go out with anyone tonight.  I just wanted to stay home and play guitar and feed this heavy feeling I had.  When I came home I changed into some more relaxed clothes and went to drop off some WAY overdue library books, get some gas, and go to the church where I would pray, read, do some study stuff, and practice de music.  I must say, that heaviness was something spiritual.  After I prayed and did my study I felt much better.  SO...I decided to go out tonight.  I got together with Anna, Jerry, Kritna, Chris, Emilia, and Kritna's little sister.  It was kind of boring over there for a while, then we watched a video of some Japanese dude beating super mario bros three in 11 minutes.  WHOA.  We played UNO for a little while...but I'm kind of burnt out on the game...plus, our attention was torn between the game and space jam, which was playing on the tv.  We played hide and go seek for like 2 rounds...but then we got bored with that (plus anna busted me up).  We watched fresh prince for a bit and then Anna and I went and jumped on the trampoline for like an hour.  I drove anna home and now here I am.  I'm going to bed.  

Jesus, you are awesome!
Again, to all my friends, brothers, and sisters Love you!

God be with you,

"event","Hello again.  I guess I'll give you the breakdown of Monday and Tuesday. 

Monday: Went to work...posted a lot on the CCF forum...

-highlight- was definitely eating lunch with anna

finished work...went home...ate dinner...worked on HW and studied for math test.  Played guitar some.  (Sound fun?)

Tuesday: I woke up later than I wanted to.  I wanted to look at the sample test for math again this morning, but since I woke so late time didn't allow.  I don't think I failed the test, but I certainly didn't an A, or B for that matter.  After the test I got some grub at the snack bar for breakfast and walked a bit.  I opened the photo I.D. office and business wasn't hopping, so I think I may have started my typical posting on the forum.  After a while anna showed up to look at some pictures of me when I was fat.  I think she got more than she was expecting, because I showed up with two photo albums.  She also brought pictures, which was nice.  I guess she figured that I was subjecting myself so she'd do the same.  She stuck around for a while, which was also nice.  

Class rolled around at 4:30 so I went.  I got there at like 4:31 and they had already started presentations.  My teacher had a funeral to go to tonight, so I guess no time got wasted.  I just want to hug her sometimes.  She's cool.  

Since no time was wasted in class, we got out really early.  My buddy Brandon and I went over to the China Wok and got some food--good stuff.  I had sesame chicken.  Brandon thought the water tasted like noodles...

After dinner I went to my civil war class.  I didn't do so bad on that test that I was worried about.  I got an 86...which is a B...I'm ok with that.  

Now I'm home.  All are in their rooms and I'm left to my thoughts.  I've been thinking about that message from Sunday.  There are so many things going on in my life right now.  I'm in such a weird place.  I know that God will lead me through all the craziness.  God is faithful.  I need Him to do a work in my life.  So many things have to be resolved, but I think fear and other things hold me back.  May He change my heart and give me courage to face all that I have to face.  I love you Lord.  May my heart be consumed with your love!  

To all my friends, brothers, and sisters: you're all special and I love you very much.  God be with you and draw you closer to Him.

"event","Well, I figure I ought to give you the story of my weekend, starting with Thursday of course.  

Thursday was a cool day.  I went to math class in the morning...always a blast.  Then, I caught anna running around and hiding behind trees at (I think that was Thursday...it may have been Wed).  I had an SGA meeting at 12:30...which I was late to, not a good thing to be when you're the leader.  I actually had someone from the meeting come and hunt me down.  He was a little upset with me I think.  I guess part of being a leader, part of life, is learning to overcome the things that hinder you.  Lateness is definitely a strong adversary in my life.  Anyway...after the meeting I went to lunch with Anna, Sarah, and Ari.  After lunch we went to the park and watched ari almost fall into a little pond because he was trying to ride a rock...only those who were present may get that.  We also went and swung on the swings which is something I haven't done in a long time.  I also listened as anna practiced singing the techno version of ""Zombie"" by the Cranberries.  I didn't really want to go to class at 4:30, but the thought of not going made me unhappy.  I didn't want to let Ms. Fletcher down.  So, Ari and I decided to go to when she let the class out for break.  Class was slack.  All we did was watch a presentation by a student of Joan of Arc.  After class, Ms. Fletcher and I spoke with each other.  Others were conversing with us as well, but we had a conversation of our own.  She told me some things that made me feel good...I like her.  After class we went and got pizza and played pool at Shorebreakers.  Pool is fun...especially when you're beating anna.  After pool some of us came back to my house and watched top gun.  I watched for a lot of the movie...but eventually I slept.  I took anna home and took ari's bike back over his house so he could get to work in the morning.  I remember thinking that ari's parents might think I was stealing it...I mean it was like 3 a.m.  Anyway...that brings me to Friday.

Friday was an ok day.  I trained my sister at her new job at the school.  That night I was sitting around missing my friends, wanting something to do, then ari got a hold of me and we got some plans together.  He and Brandon came over and we played some video games.  After Brandon left, Ari and I made my signature for the CCF forum.  Surprisingly enough, it took us a while and in the end I didn't get to bed until after 6 a.m.  

Saturday I hung out with anna, kritna, and ari...always fun.  

Sunday, I had church.  Sunday night's service was really powerful.  My pastor preached a message that really ""read my mail.""  If you're not familiar with what that means...basically it means that he preached to my life like he knew everything that was going on.  I think God really spoke to me through the message tonight, but the question is what do I do with it?  The title of the message was ""The Burning Yes."" Basically, it was talking about desiring God more than anything.  What is it that controls you?  What is it that consumes the thoughts of your mind day to day.  What gets the majority of your attention and sincere devotion?  I hope it's a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.  Our main goal as Christians should be to know Him who created us and who loved us enough to lay down His own life and die for OUR transgressions, just so we could live with Him forevermore.  My my my, God is good!  I hope those reading this might know the life that is in Him.  I love you Lord.  

I love you all, very much, who are my friends, brothers, and sisters.  You know who you are.  

May the God of Heaven and Earth bless and keep you in all that you do.  In the name of Jesus Christ--Amen."

"event","This is my first entry in this thing.  I wonder, what do I put in here?  Do I display the thoughts and emotions that fill my day, do I dare even scratch the surface?  Do I lay out the physical, emotional, or spiritual for anyone and everyone to see?  I don't kid myself...I'm not so popular that everyone's going to rush to read the happenings of my day.  But really, what is it that should be on display for all to see?  I don't believe that my day was really all that interesting.  Sadly, I let a lot of it waste away.  Minutes that are unredeemable were spent staring at a computer screen, posting away at a forum that, at the end of the day, doesn't amount to anything but wasted time.  I wonder what three words come next, or what the person below me will say about me (I hope in my heart it is good).  I studied for my test that I had tonight...which I didn't do as well as I should have because of the before mentioned vice that I've seemed to develop so quickly.  Now I'm here, and I'm going to bed.  

All Glory and Honor and Power unto the only One who is worthy, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the one who was, who is, and who is to come.  I love you.

I promised a friend I would write all these down, and send it to someone or post it somewhere, and I'm frankly not sure why, but I told him I would.

I'm supposed to be five feet, five inches tall.

I'm supposed to have an army of dress slacks.

I'm supposed to look great in a little black dress, have casual wear that includes blazer-cut jackets, an antique engagement ring, and pointy-toed shoes that make my body look long and lean.

Oh, and I should shop at IKEA, use a power-drill, chop my vegetables impeccable, be an activist, donate money to important causes, march in the streets, call my senators, and meditate daily.


there's more, I'm sure, but now it's long after I was supposed to go to bed."

I am at my grandmother's house in oregon and thought I'd give an update in case anyone still actually checks this thing.

(Megan, I'm going to call you soon, like maybe tomorrow, if I don't lose your number before then, to firm up whether I can stay with you in chicago or not.)

Let's see.
Right. so I'm at my grandmother's house on the coast of oregon, and dad's here too, and we're helping her pack up her house to move, as it sold unexpectedly quickly and . . . here we are!  Right.  

So we spent an alarming portion of the day packing up my grandmother's  glass menagerie, composed mainly of unicorns but faries and ceramic teddy bears as well.

there's a plum tree in her yard that produces amazingly good plums, and blackberry bushes with some of the only wild blackberries I've ever found sweet enough.  (in the back yard, though. the ones in the front are terrible.)

I'm trying desperately to stay on eastern time, but it's not going well so far--it's past my bedtime back east, but it's only nine here!  Yuck.

Also, I'm dating a really great guy.  I thought I would mention that.  Because I'm telling everyone all the fucking time 'cause it's so cool and I'm, like, fifteen years old.  And Sleep-deprived.

I love, love, *love* living with my roommate.  He's moving away.  There are a lot of options before me, none of them all *that* attractive.  Well, one is pretty attractive, namely having a friend move in, but that's looking unlikely.  What can I do instead?

And what would it be like if I lived alone?

I would spend even more time on the phone, for one thing. And I'd be online more.  I'd probably get repetitive strain injury.  
And I'd have plenty of room in the refrigerator for all my things.

1.) We're having a housewarming party! yay!  Can my richmond friends come? You could carpool to save money on gas, and then maybe you could like, talk and get to know one another better! Which you totally should, as you are excellent people and, if given the time and place, I think would like each other very much. I'll give you the date in personal correspondence.

2.)The after-school program I'm running is AMAZING.  We're getting donations left and right, the five-year-olds are learning chess, the boys are learning to knit and sew, leaves are being pressed and pictures drawn as we merrily wend our way into the academic year.  The kids had two big projects, hurricane relief and a sale of their arts/crafts for the holidays, and they've decided to combine the two--they'll be selling scarves, doll clothes, bookmarks, and god knows what else they've made, then donating the proceeds to whatever charity we choose, probably the red cross.  The showstopper should be the collection of burgundy chenille scarves that we're going to make, thanks to an extraordinarily generous donation of the biggest ... thing... (it's not a skein) of yarn I've ever seen.  As one girl was leaving the room, she announced that she'd be very surprised if we make less than $100 on this event, and I have to say, I'm starting to agree with her.

3.) I am learning to be a competent driver, very slowly, as it is not all that easy to acquire the use of both a person's car and a person's time to make this happen.  (The roommate's truck is a quirky old toyota with a stick shift and no power steering, which makes it extremely hard to drive, plus I suspect he'll never let me behind the wheel again, since I drove it for two miles with the parking brake on, *not* that this is something that ever happened before or will ever happen again or anything.)  I've decided that if the point is learning city driving, I need to be in an automatic.  Period. Learning stick is for when someone has the time and patience to teach me.

4.) I might be taking out a bank loan and buying a car in the next two weeks.  Then again, I might not.  I also might rent a car to go home for thanksgiving.  No matter how I get there, though, I'm going home for thanksgiving and I'm driving, even if that means doing that hour from the bus stop to home in my mom's car.

5.) I went out on a couple dates with a guy I like. I'm reserving judgement for as long as possible.  

6.)  I'm starting a literary magazine at the preschool.  I expect it will mostly be descriptions of pictures they've drawn (along with pictures) but stories and quotations as well, and .  It was inspired by a drawing done by a three year old of a little pink girl standing on a little green house, and the wonderful poetry she spoke as she told me about her picture.  

""It's about a pepperoni and a peach and copper.  And the author is my name is Ariel teacher disneyland girl.  And she loves the whole world, even the sky.  And that's me!""

Loving even the sky,

"event","I just got an icebreaker on an online personals site--this means a guy sent me a free content-less generic message expressing his interest in me.

This has to be the best ""more about who I'm looking for"" that I've ever seen:

""I'm looking for my kind.She has to posses my qualities.Must be very pretty and charming.She must not be stingy,greedy and sellfish.Must be very intelligent.Above all,she must have the fear of God in her heart.""

(Maybe I should change my heading to ""No, really! I'm an atheist!""  Right now it says ""This insightful and compelling headline magically deflects conservatives!"" which I had hoped would serve the same purpose.)

You scored better than half in Nerd, earning you the title of: <b>Pure Nerd</b>.

The times, they are a-changing. It used to be that being exceptionally
smart led to being unpopular, which would ultimately lead to picking up

Being smart isn't as socially crippling as it once was, and even more

So, as an empowerment type thing, I've decided to tackle the impossible and learn how to drive.  And buy a car.  And drive said car home for thanksgiving.

So what I really need to do right now is get a budget in place and find out where and when to take my permit test.

Know what I'm doing instead?

Dicking around with online personals.

Le sigh.

Even sleeping would be better.

Also, I think my phone is malfunctioning and no longer ringing.  

Okay. So. to do a budget I need to umm... write down all my monthly expenses in the same place.  
like the bills and stuff.
Including student loans. 

Off I go!

"event","In a rare bit of LJ-drama, I suspect that Davin is passive-agressively trying to tell me he reads my LJ without my permission.

That being said (and having been posted solely for my own amusement) I'm really excited and nervous and all sorts of things about my new job on monday.

Basically, I work at the best preschool in the city. and we have a summer program for schoolage kids, which is, somehow, *not* one of the best in the city. To put it delicately.  It's just kind of ... like daycare or babysitting, really. no cool activities, no enrichment. 
I won't say anything else beyond that, but ... yeah. not cool.

So my goal is, in the three weeks remaining in the program, to completely turn it around and make it as good as the preschool.

Like, woah.

So, right. I have a lot of stuff to do, starting with dealing with the angry parents who are unhappy with how the program is going.
And umm . . . 

But I feel ready to do that! yes!

So I'm going to work on my plans now.

Lucyislawless is devoted to the flawless

Lucy is not a hooker

Lucy is taking shape

Lucy is an inflatable whale that you can construct

Lucy is probably disturbed

Lucy is known as the ""elephant hotel""

Lucy is a very fearful yet friendly dog

Lucy is clever: I understand that young lucy is clever.

Lucy is royally unbelievable

Lucy is well known in america's collective unconscious

Lucy is quite certain that many of her readers feel the same way

"event","I'm still not caught up on my friends page reading, but I love you all.

So this weekend I did a seminar.  After doing said seminar, I developed the following 
Being an extraordinary teacher every single day, empowering students, ending bullying in my classroom, going to my boss and asking her to create a special position just for me since I'm too awesome for part time, living alone and loving it,  being comfortable in my identity as an adult, and bringing my family together for a vacation even though we're all broke.
Two weeks ago I thought those things were either maybe possible someday, or they hadn't even occurred to me.
Since sunday every single one of those things is three quarters accomplished.

For instance:
When there was bullying before, I used feel it was (unsatisfactorially) resolved when both sides were okay. Now it's only resolved when both sides are empowered.

Honestly, since bullying is the most important issue in any classroom, (to me anyway, since it scarred me for life) that was worth $410 all by myself.

I've been at my best every single moment this week. 

My in short possibility for my life is the possibility of being vibrant and empowering. And you know what? I am.

Love,
Squashy

P.S. if you live in the US or Canada, it's pure stupidity that's kept me from calling you: I have unlimited long distance.  Send me your number if you'd fancy a chat!"

And this little girl toddled over to a teacher and touched the teacher's leg and said ""oooh!"" and the teacher said ""They're smooth, aren't they? You're lucky, I just shaved!""

Then, since I guess she was on a roll, the girl toddled over to me, put a hand on my shin, and said ""ouch!""

News: I got a promotion at work to being the lead teacher in the school-age program. My boss told me that she's been really impressed with my performance and what I've been learning.  It's only a half-time position, so I'll still be subbing a lot to get near full-time hours enough to keep my health insurance, but I get to decorate a classroom and plan lessons and stuff! yay!

And the hours: two to six pm, weekdays, full time school holidays and in the summer. Sweet!
And that leaves me enough time to take college classes in early childhood!


The negative: this position is contingent on my learning how to drive a fifteen passenger van.

*So*

Since I don't know how to drive, period,  I'll have to take professional classes, which will be very expensive, but with any luck I'll be a very safe driver by the end of it.

A favorite teacher of mine, in whose classroom I recently did a two week stint, was going on maternity leave, and I really wanted to sub for her, but the brand new assistant director put someone else instead--perfectly reasonable, she just didn't know.
*But* it turns out that that someone else can't do it, so I get seven glorious weeks in one of my favorite classrooms with some completely awesome kids! I actually get to do some planning! and have responsibilities! but not too many!

Highlights of today:

One of the coteachers told me she had begged the director to put me in the classroom 'cause she wanted to do it.

Parent of one of the coolest kids ever told me that she's glad I'm doing it 'cause she thinks I'm a great teacher. 

Other parents of also cool kids expressed happiness in this as well.

Got large paycheck.

Realized there are only ten more days till harry potter!

Acquired allergy medicine leading to allergy shot leading possibly to normal eating habits again instead of avoiding corn wheat, beef, dairy, tomatoes, potatoes, and soy in diet.

Got paid a little overtime.

Got child with behavior problems to lay on his cot and sleep at naptime.

So one of the things about subbing is that you don't really have hte same schedule day to day, you don't know if there'll be room in the fridge for your lunch, funny kindergartener stuff like that.
*but* I will now be coming in daily at the same perfectly reasonable hour for seven glorious weeks.

What a sweet fuckin' chance to prove myself and what I've learned!!

Love,

"event","Today at work I was comforting a little girl who was crying for her dad on the playground. (she's three).  Her older brother, who is five, happened to be on hand.  I asked him if there's anything she likes to do with their dad, since happy memories of daddy might distract her.

His response?
""Sometimes she joins him in conversation.""

(This, you see, is what American children with British mothers are like.)

"event","Hey Sweeties!

I haven't been updating.

What have I been doing?
Spending not much time on the computer, for one. 
(also I ripped a thumbnail and now typing hurts, but that's just today.)

I've been on the computer surprisingly little lately.

What have I been doing?

Weeeeelll, I went to photodiva's wedding in New Hampshire. 
And I've been subbing full time at the preschool, and totally loving it.

Today at work a girl asked me what the dedication page of a book said. I read it to her, and it finished with ""brining the joy of reading to children everywhere.""  She told me I ""sound like PBS kids.""
Which is totally the best compliment I""ve ever gotten from a kid. I sound like a PBS announcer!

I've got a subbing job in the *same room* for the next two weeks. Hoooraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!

Big shoutout to photodiva for posting on the last meme. yaaaaaaaaay! thank you!

I bought a VCR this weekend!  Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! I bought it at a yard sale for $2.
It goes nicely with my yard sale TV.

I was walking home through my quiet little tree-and-garden residential neighborhood today when I stopped to smell some roses. Out of nowhere (I had my headphones on) this older woman comes up to me and asks if I'd like some to take home. I was dumbfounded, so she said ""You don't have to take them!""  and I recovered sufficiently to say that I would enjoy them. She told me to stay right there and she came back with garden shears and cut me four big brances of pink rambling roses, which I took home and are now sitting in a red glass vase on my kitchen table.

I decided that since I was literally stopping to smell the roses when this happened, this is the universe's way of telling me that it's really okay to just be mellow and kinda lazy like I am . . . just chill and enjoying the moment.

Speaking of enjoyable moments, I had a kid say today that there were no dinosaurs ""in the eighties. When the titanic sank.""

Love,
Squashy"

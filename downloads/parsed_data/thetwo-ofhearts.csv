So Gloria and i did break up. Nothing was working out the way we wanted it too and we just fought too much. herfaderf. Whatever. So, as we were going our seperate ways, i did find a place to live in the corner of town away from it all. It's really sweet and nice. Gloria moved out not to long after me and she's doing fine. I can already tell most of you know the story and thats fine and dandy, I just had to lay that down as the beginning of my tale.

Summer came and went and I was living on my own. I whored my self out to dominos and started taking 40 hour work weeks because there was nothing else i could do. I worked the summer away with my pals at Dominos. Jake DeRusso came back and worked for as the insider. All was well and nothing too crazy happened.

I think I did some fun things, but eh, nothing too memorable if I cant even remember them.

I did get a kitty though. Living alone sorta sucks so I got little Murphy to keep me company. he's a good kitty. Check facebook to see him.

But I guess that brings me to today. I work 50 hours a week. I dont have much free time. And I havent ran into a drama llama in ages. 

I think the world finally settled down and came to all their senses. Then again, who knows what sort of murphys law i just set off by saying that. Oh lawds. What have i done? </lj-cut>"

By 9:00 we were probably about 10 blocks away from the events and gave up, found a spot on a side street where the ball was in plain view and watched the bands on big screen for a while.

It isn't something recent. It's something that has been sitting in the back of my mind for quite sometime. It's something I couldn't understand, and I wanted to know the truth from everyone who doesn't talk to me anymore. It's not that who ever doesn't talk to me anymore because of what I thought (I hope), it's that I'm too busy with work, school, or whatever.

Do you hate me, or do you just hate Gloria and by defult me? 

No, seriously. It always seems that people ""side"" with Mike, Anya or anyone else that hangs out at that herpie house well knowing that they despise us. Then talk to me like nothing at all ever happened. Even though you've slandered my name and hers. 

You all think that Gloria ripped me away from all of you. No, she didn't. She set me back into a socially acceptable life. I have a job that makes me work nights. I go to school in the mornings. So that means I rarely have time to even see Gloria. I love her, so when I do get free time, she's gonna get it. Just because I didn't or don't have time to waste with you assholes in a fucking turf trailer or go on ridiculous adventures that only waste gas doesn't mean she ""ripped"" me away from you.

I am sick and tired of believing that someone I know is actually my friend, only to find out that they make fun of me behind my back. Most of us are closing in on our 20's, if not there already, and you still insist on wasting your lives doing absolutly nothing! I don't understand. Hell, theres still that handful of you that actually go to college and/or have jobs and <i>still</i> think that Gloria and I are the bad guys. Don't you care that your so called friends talk about you behind your back because you're socially better than them. Because you can pay your own way through life, or got lucky and had your LOVING parents send you to college. 

Call me a bad person. Call me a ""drama-starter"". Call me whatever you want. But if you make fun of me because I'm so called ""whipped"" (it's called DEVOTION"", look it up, morons), or because my parent's send me to college, or anyother things you can find to make fun of me, don't talk to me. Don't IM me. Don't call me. Don't make an effort to see me. I don't deserve friends like you. I'd be better on my own.

Do you get paid for lying? Or just get the pleasure out of being a hypocrite?

Gloria never blamed you for getting her arrested. She was just upset at the fact that you didn't give a flying fuck after she got sent to the police station. She only knew Dick a week or so and he tried harder than you did. You told us not to be ""snitches"" when Heather was bothering us, and we listened to you. Yeah that's our fualt, but so much for being a good friend there. We could have ended it all there so you wouldn't have had that encounter months later. We never told you who to be friends with. Amanda became friends with you so we cut ourselves out even moreso. We may have warned you because shes young and we didn't want to see Jovell get in shit for it. We never told you ""DO NOT BE FRIENDS WITH HER WHATSOEVER"". And deny it till you fucking keel over, but you did call us ""high and mighty"" for having jobs. Because we ""ditched you"". Oops sorry for paying attention to me for once.

The entire post you made about me and gloria consisted of half truths and whole lies. You've talked shit about half the people on that list you made and I can quote you on a few of them if you'd like. I remember them because they really pissed me off. I won't post it here, just so I don't ""ruin any more friendships for you.""

What I really don't understand is how you can act like this, and not realize that we've acted the same way. I acknowledge that we've done some stupid shit, and we've gotten shit from you. NOW YOU'RE ACTING THE SAME WAY WE DID AND EVERYONE WHO YOU'VE DECIVED IS ACTING LIKE YOU'RE THE VICTIM? What the fuck.

Neither of us called you brain washed. This is Anya putting words in all our mouths as she always has. I called you dedicated. There's nothing wrong with being dedicated. I really don't know what to say. Mocking me for my and glorias job just proves so much. Back when Anya started to say we were ""high and mighty"" with our jobs. No, we want to fucking work for what we eventually fucking earn. Don't you of all people fucking understand that by working night and day at rubys? And now Anya is talking like she has the greatest job in the world? who's acting High and Mighty now?
Mooching of my parents huh? You know gloria has a tab like I do and we pay nearly 100 dollars a week to pay it off? I still have a 5 grand tab with my parents. My car and other expenses they've vouched for me. Glorias is nearly off because she decided to pick up a second job that was easier than her grooming job for spending cash. What can you say to that? I mean you wash dishes. That sure has a lot of space for advancement. You can totally start your own business with that under your belt. What happened to college for you anyway? To tough and a GED really stood for the ""good enough degree""? I realized something a while back and I decided to re-enroll with college. my parent's are paying my way, I'm pretty sure yours can too. Or did you and anya mooch off of them too long?

and if you knew anything about cervical cancer, you dont have to get it from some one. Unlike Herpes, gonorrhea and clamidiya like anya has. Thats not me making rumors, thats facts ANYA told GLORIA. Hope you're all checked out.

Third Place Bronze medal girlfriend? What are you implying mike? That I settled for this girl? Nice fucking try. I was interested in gloria all the fucking way back before I even ditched Heather. I was just unsure of what guys she was into. Didn't want to persue another lost cause. Unfortunatly for you, you got with anya after she cheated on mike wilson with you and you just couldn't break away from a girl who is as disgusting and pathetic as you.

So you're buying into anyas pity stories? Can't say I'm surprised. That car accident she had so many years ago seems to still be bothering her. Not to mention how her mommy doesn't approve of her at all. We've all been through some sick shit in our lives. It's not like we can experience it all. So fuck you and your childish ways. I'm trying my fucking hardest to stay out of this bullshit and move on. I don't want to keep this constant fighting. It's wasting my fucking time.

I honestly say I don't hate you, but you've done the same thing to yourself right now as you did with athena. The only difference is you can see Anya a lot more than you did her. You're as dedicated to your female half as I am. 

I can say a few things though. If anything, the only thing that truly urks me is the nonsense of what I've heard about Gloria. How she was ""harassing"" Anya about the money or whatever. I can say that we didn't even remember it because it was a gift so long ago. To hear that shes been harassing anya was simply absured. So we lived up the the crime we were acused of. What did you or anya want? Just to bad mouth us with out having anything actually happen? I won't allow it.

I don't like causing drama. I don't talk to people that I don't want to any more. One full year ago, I was getting rid of Heather. One full year. The ammount of problems I had last year was unbearing. Mostly because I bothered myself with everyone elses problems. Now the only thing I worry myself over is ""do i have enough gas to get to work, or should I fill up now.""

Gloria and Heather are no where the same. I can't say the same for Anya. Hell she used to say that her and Heather could be sisters. Something I could never stand. But to say ""Used and abused"" is a little much to say now. You should know how dedicated I get to a relationship. It takes time for me to love someone. I give my life to that person and I don't need you to tell me that I've given it to the wrong person. I don't let gloria boss me around. The only thing that she's ever asked of me is to not hang out with Amanda. I can comply with that. It's just unfortunate that she was hanging out with you all and you took to her as you always have. I took that sacrifice for gloria. Just like you've made sacrifices for Anya. And I know you have, I may not know what they are, but I do know we share that dedication I keep talking about. You must have atleast once. And yes, I have acknowledged the fact that, yes, I am whipped, but I don't let myself get abused or run dry anymore. I don't go out of my way for people anymore. If I did, don't you think that I would have settled this by now by being in the middle as I've tried to do before?

I don't believe that everyone is against me. I know people don't like me. It's fucking human nature not to like someone after they've done stupid shit. You all forgave me for the shit I did after I threw heather away. I don't need that pity again. I knew I was a laughing stock then, and I know I am now. If you wan't to deny it, that's fine and dandy, but you know, I don't even care anymore. That's why I don't want to see any of you.

Color me crazy, but alex said one time ""I'd give up my crazy hair for one more day in 12th grade"", and you know what, it sounds great. Back then we were the best of friends and you know what killed it. The Garretteers forgot the one rule men should never forget. ""BROS B4 HOS, MAN."" (it's to late for jokes anymore).

There's nothing more I can think I can say now. If anything I'm glad how things are now. Mike, if the horrible happens and you and anya do split, I would forgive and forget this hatred as you did for me once. I can't say that for many people anymore, but you are still one of them. Dispite the way you feel about me right now.

All I want, is this to end. I've given my 2 cents and that's all I can do."

I don't go for more than 3 hours a day, so the stress of being able to get all my homework done is quelled. I was more than surprised to see a lot of people there that I didn't think I'd see. Not in a bad way of course, more of an ""oh holy shit"" sorta way. 

I'm still working about 4 to 5 days a week and couldn't be happier. Even though I can't stand most of my co-workers, the job is still awesome.

ELEVEN GODDAMNED VOICEMAILS.

that made me feel like goddamned shit.

I don't think that there was one person I didn't know that wasn't hanging out last night at the fire. And some how, all these people forgot that I have to get up every goddamned morning at 7 o fucking clock to make it to work on time. And I go to bed at night anywhere from 12am to 1 am EVERY FUCKING NIGHT.

THATS LESS THAN 8 HOURS OF SLEEP A NIGHT.

I don't want friends anymore.
I'm sick and tired of drama. Especially when people are being two faced and just love to pass the guilt on to my fucking back. 
I'm honestly sick and tired of every last one of you mother fuckers. Covering your own asses to look good for everyone else. I know that theres shit talk of me and Gloria. I know it. Doesn't need to be said. Shit talk happens when you've got two faced friends.

Not going to lie, I don't agree with half of this shit you people that can read this do. I don't and I know you don't like the way I run shit. It's how this stuff starts. But lying is another thing. I've lied a lot in my life and I admit it. I'm a damn good liar and only a select few can see through me and know when I'm lying. I try not to lie because of that and for other good reasons. I know that nearly EVERYONE I know has lied to me. Lately, it seems that theres been more going on than what I could have seen in the past.

This applies to everyone and all of you. If you want specifics, I'll fucking spill. I'm tired of just letting shit slide, I'm tired of ""oh i'm sorry lozl"", I love my life alone with Gloria, so fine, I don't need you god damned gossip-whores in my life. Some of you will know right fucking now what you're guilty of and won't need to ask me. Others won't have a fucking clue whats going on.

Call me names for not hanging out. Make fun of me and Gloria for having ""jobs"" because we think we're ""higher and mightier"" than you. Mock us for whatever you'd like. Just shows how ""important"" we are for you.

This is god damned ridiculous.

I work all week everyweek now. Both of my jobs seem to take up all my time. 8:30 - 3 for my morning job then 4 or 5 - 12 most nights. Thus the reason you've all seen less of me around. I'm too fucking tired all the time to hang out. My only days off to relax are sunday and monday afternoon. Even then I'm busy as fuck and barely get a chance to sit and take time to rest.

I miss all my friends but in the same instance, I know you guys will always be there. Alex's post of ""life long chums"" made me realize this. I don't know what in my head clicked and made me start acting like this but I feel more... <i>older</i> than what I did just a few months ago. I don't mind going to bed early and missing out on seeing my friends. The quiet life isn't as bad when you've got to experience the life most teenagers do of ""drugs, sex, and rock and roll"". Maybe I'm exaggerating. Who knows.

I love Gloria Hoerauf more than anything ever in the history of all, and I can't seem to say that enough. If I could come home every night to her, I wouldn't need to ask for anything else. Ever.

Yeah that's pretty much it."

Everyone there is so chill and friendly. I work with Dante and some girl that Adrian knew from Shaker. Woo hoo.

<h3>Eight reasons why a tyrannosaurs caught in a tornado is a funny thing to think about</h3>

<img src=""http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3218/tornadorexii8.jpg"">

<b>1) the tiny, flailing arms

2) the helpless ""RARRRRRRRRR!""

3) the angry, wild-eyed expression

4) that dinosaur with the sail on his back floats by and he's just cruisin'

5) the landing

6) the Wizard of Oz music playing in the background. What an anachronism!

7) tyrannosaurs inhabited the western United States, an area of the country known for its heavy tornado activity. statistically speaking, it is probable that the scenario in question happened at least once. in this, as in all enduring comedy, there is a grain of indilutable truth inside the humor.

8) ""RARRRRRR!"" ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! ""RAAAAARRRRRR!""</b></lj-cut>

Lastnight was ok... at first it sucked the most... it was super boring... but after awhile i actually had a good time! haha i took some funny pictures ! Lisa bruce left early and if she would have stayed she would have won a circus ticket... i was going to go up and get it for her but i didnt think they'd give it to me.. they would think i was trying to scam it... oh well though...

I am the boredest... i see damian across the street playing basketball.. i would go over and talk to him if i wasnt still in my pj's ! haha god im bored someone come and get me so i can go somewhere... =|ugh

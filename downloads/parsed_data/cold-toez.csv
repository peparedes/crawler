"event","Okay, So I am realizing that whenever I update its always about something depressing or just about me not being happy. Lately, and I don't know why, I have just been feeling like I am not good enough, and when I say not good enough I mean for anything or anyone. I don't know why or how I have friends or I'll want to know why the ""good guys"" don't like me and never will. I have just been in an extremely depressed state. I must say it is pretty annoying. I just wish that more things would go my way. I have been doing poorly in school as well. It seems like nothing can be right. 

Honestly, I need someone to tell me... Is there something wrong with me? I'm usually not of those girls who says ""I'm fat"", but I will admit that I don't think I'm pretty. Its not that I think I'm ugly I just... don't know anything anymore. Right now I just wish things would change, and for the better. I guess that'll be it for tonight."

"event","Okay so lets start with Friday.  
Friday: During school Friday I didn't really have much to do after school so during the day Nick (with the Mohawk) and I were like we are doing something after school.  So Nick, Nick, Julio, Ben and I all walked to the bus stopped and headed toward the mall...except Nick (without the Mohawk) went home, he just had to walk in the same direction.  Then Nick (with the Mohawk) and I got off the bus but Ben and Julio stayed on and went home. Nick and I hung out for a little bit.  We ate some food walked around and talked.  It sounds pretty boring but it really wasn't.  He is a really cool kid and someone that I find my self able to open up with. Im happy that i decided to go.  Then I went home and straighted up the house for company. It was my moms friends birthday and her husband was out of town. So they came over for dinner and then people came over after dinner, while they went out and we surprized her with them. It was pretty fun! Then I didn't go to bed until 4 in the morning I had so much energy!

Saturday: Woke up at 1:25 in the after noon!  I didn't some homeowrk..not much.  Then got ready for progressive dinner. It was so fun.  I must admit i liked it better last year but it wasnt bad this year.  then Gina slept over and we did a lot of homework.  With is really unlike us because when we are together we usually don't get any homework done! Then she fell asleep and i was online doing some more homeowrk and chatting.

Sunday:  I had to work this morning at 11...and NO people do not get ice cream that early...we need an hour to open the store. People are always asking that.  So i worked until 4 and then went to borders with Megan and  we were looking for a scene we didnt have much luck.  Looks like we will be doing something from Steel Magnolias.  Oh well it should be good.  Then I did some more homework, ate and now i am typing.  Overall i would say this weekend wasnt too shabby..

What sounds do ducks make Gina?  Lol lova ya!

List ten songs that you are currently digging...it doesn't matter
what genre they are from, whether they have words, or even if they're
no good but they must be songs you're really enjoying right now. Post
these instructions, the artists, and the ten songs in your journal.
Then tag five other random people to see what they're listen to.

OK to warn those who might read I listen to pretty weird music...
1. Down With Disease
2. Waste
3. Man in the Mirror
4. Thriller
5. The Thunder Rolls
6. Calling Baton Rouge
7. Super Mario Brothers..lol its awesome!
8. The Mango Song
9. Marijuana
10. Live like you were Dying


Ok now that thats over I really don't have much to say..except I had a pretty wack dream the other night...The only thing is I don't know why it was so wack.. Anyways,  I went to my sisters ""house"" today.  I was doing a good job and being a big help my breaking the tile off of the floor and I found this awesome record player at the house so I took it home with me. On Wednesday Julio is going to come over and try to help me get it to work...  hope it does!  I have so many records that I would love to listen to!  Umm but other then that other is really going on... But I'm pretty excited for school tomorrow! :)"

"event","Oh yes, I realized, after I posted that I have more to add.  Drama Club is pretty good.  Although there are no ""Seniors"" which makes it feel weird. I went to the first meeting, and to my surprize I didn't see the same people that introduced me to Drama as a freshmen.  I was shocked.  Although I knew they wouldn't be there it was like I expected them to be and when I didn't see them I realized for the first time that this year was going to be a very strange year.  

Also Homecoming is coming up.  Im not sure if I want to go or not... maybe if I have a date, which I probably won't, I'll go.  So that basically means I'm not going to homecoming. Um.. sorry I forgot to put all this useless information in the update before, I'm sure i missed some stuff in here so I might update again.  lol Sorry if I do and you become bored if you read!"

I feel like lately I have been wanting just a hook up, but I'm not sure if thats what I want at all. Have you ever liked anybody because they liked you? Is that normal?  I wish I new what I wanted! Lately I just haven't been able to find my own little ""Happy Place"". Once I do I think I will be good for the rest of the year.  I truely don't know how, but I put on a front for everyone.  I can act like I am so happy.  On the inside though I don't know what the hell I should do about ANYTHING! I really just need someone I trust, yes Gina I do trust you, but I think I need to talk to someone I don't talk to as much.  Maybe they will see it in a different way then I do. I hate being so unsure about everything I do!  If you are willing to listen to and help me just IM or call me or do something to let me know you are willing.  Please don't say you are and then not want I really need somone!  But now moving on...
I have just been informed that Taravella has lost a football game tonight 26 to 28.  Wow! That is pretty close considering last year and every other year before hasn't been very good.  We have already done good in the first two games.  (That was the third one...haha) 
What has been going on in everyone elses lives.  I am very interested to know!  
I guess thats it for now...  I just want all of you to know I love you and thanks for being there for me. I dont think I tell you all enough. :)  Love you!!! xoxo"

Anyways what better place to start then the last day of school.  I went right to Gina's dads house in Tampa and hung out there for a few days. It was great!!  Her dad took me for a ride on his motorcycle,  I have to say that was a first.  Then we saw sisterhood of the traveling pants.  Not the best movie but it wasn't terrible.  Then we traveled to Gainsville and stayed in a hotel for about 2 days while the rest of Gina's family went to Jeff's college to got his schdule.  That was fun!!!  then I arrived home on the 7th and was sick until the 23rd. How bad does that suck!!!! I know really bad.  
Gina was still there while I was home so I worked alot to keep myself busy.  I got some new stuff to wear so thats pretty cool.  oh and I redecorated my room!  Not to shabby.

I really dont have much to say nothing of any importance happens in my life....

OH WAIT.. Gina got..no no no MADE me a present while she was in Tampa...Its the coolest thing.  It says friends know everything about you and still like you..lol ok well now thats it.

Fall Out Boy - Grand Theft Autumn (Where Is Your Boy) Lyrics 

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on the hope i forget that you hate him more than you notice I wrote this for you.
You need him. I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying.
That's more than I can say for him.

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town.

Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
But for the meantime I'll sport my brand new fashion
of waking up with my pants off at 4:00 in the afternoon.
You need him, I could be him
I could be an accicent but I'm still trying.
That's more than I can say for him.

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know, you were the last good thing about this part of time
(Repeat)

Maybe he won't find out what I know, you were the last good thing about this part of town"

ugh..life really sucks sometimes expecially right now... its even worse when u cant do anything to make it better.  and when so many good things r happening and nothing helps... oh well there isnt anything i can do about it... later"

"event","Hey everyone..Isnt this the coolest new layout??? I think so!!!  Yeah so today was pretty good overall...but lets start from last night.  I was talking to Dana last night and we were having a gay little fight so i started the day mad.  Then when i had Fenda i got to have class outside cos he didnt have the key since we switched classes and all.  So that was pretty cool, plus it mad it easier to get to math, WHICH WAS SO BORING...like always.  then i had GAY ASS MRS. ((EEFING)) CRYSTAL... finally that was over and i went to lunch..it was the same as always.. then i had geoff..that stands for geography...and Dana and I made up!!! YAY..then i had a meeting thingy with my parents and MRS. ((EEFING)) CRYSTAL and that went well...NOT...it sucked and my parents HATE her now and im not taking sign language next year.  I cant deal with her for another second!  then i had drama and presented my project.. it went ok..i think I thought so anyways and Kat told me it did so thats cool.

um oh yeah I need to get Ben a v-day present if you have any ideas leave a comment or call or im or something cos i have NO IDEA what to get him!!!
Oh and this weekend Dana, Ross, Ben, and I are having a pre v-day party..kinda w/e its gunna be fun!! i cant wait!!! but i need to get him something!!!

Yeah so thats it for now...later"

Mariah Carey
One Sweet Day


Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Darling, I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way

One sweet day

Green Day Lyrics
Boulevard Of Broken Dreams Lyrics

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
and I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah
Ah-ah, Ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a...

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a...

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone..."

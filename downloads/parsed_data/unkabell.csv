<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> Unlike everyone else you<br>can change your body materia and transform into<br>anything (e.g. an animal). This can be used in<br>good purposes for infiltrating evil<br>headcuarters or adjust your physical abilities<br>by transforming and therefor do better in<br>battle. If turned to the evil side, a<br>transfomer could manipulate the ""good<br>guys"" by looking like their loved ones and<br>break them down.<br>As a person you are dissapointed with life. You<br>have not so many interests anymore and has<br>become depressed. Of course you can be happy,<br>but your happiness subsides quickly and don't<br>last very long. You isloate yourself from<br>people since you think they would only hurt<br>you, but some part just wants someone equal who<br>understands the pain. When you transform it<br>gives you freedom and you can be anything but<br>yourself. You often pity yourself but don't let<br>people come near and know what's going on with<br>you. But the thought of opening up and risking<br>being betrayed is too strong and intimidating<br>to even try.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> You carry much hate to<br>the world and yourself and in the long run this<br>could lead to dangerous thoughts<br>(suicide/cutting/killing) though the last one<br>is least likeable since you would probably just<br>have too much guilt. </p>

The way you<br>usually act around others isn't how you truly<br>feel.  You don't want pity from people; thus,<br>you don't make yourself seem pitiful.  You're a<br>very unique individual and are extremely<br>talented.  Most people envy you, but it doesn't<br>matter.  You know the true you that no one else<br>knows.  You tend to be envious of others,<br>wishing you had what they have to fill the<br>whole in your soul.  All you want is someone<br>who truly loves and understands you; someone<br>you can trust.  If you were an anime character<br>you would control darkness.  You would have the<br>power to steal people's souls.

Although you mean<br>no harm, you can't always be perfectly<br>understood in the world. No one can. Life in<br>general are you quite serene with even if there<br>are some things you don't like. Your love-life<br>is not so full of boys/girls, but if you<br>flirted more with the ones you were interested<br>in I'm sure something would happen.

This<br>means that you have a talent for identifying<br>others emotions, often by simply glancing at<br>them. You are EXTREMELY shy and quiet.

Youre the often silent, goody two shoes,<br>and few get passed the walls youve built up to<br>stop yourself being hurt, as you no doubt have<br>been in the past. Not everyone understands you,<br>in fact some think that youre a snob or worse<br>because you rarely participate in group<br>activities. Youre extremely sensitive, even the<br>least harsh of words can hurt you. Only your<br>very few, closest friends who have earned your<br>hard-to-get trust know who you really are<br>inside; a sweet, gentle young woman who is<br>lonely and so desperately needing friends to<br>support you. You can get very depressed and not<br>always know why, despite your power of empathy,<br>as it seems to only work for people outside<br>you. Your friends always turn to you when they<br>need advice or comforting, and in some way you<br>need to give that helpit makes you feel better<br>in return to know that youve helped out your<br>friends. Despite your cold, impassive exterior<br>and high, seemingly unbreachable walls, inside<br>you are really a great, intelligent person,<br>full of compassion and love, if only people<br>would dare take a chance and try to get through<br>your tough shell. Never let others get you<br>down, or change you. You are very special the<br>way you areeven if you dont have fifty thousand<br>friends, you are just as, if not more<br>extraordinary than everyone else. Reach for the<br>stars, because I dont doubt youll catch hold of<br>them.

"event","Yesterday was a good day. I hung out with Dane from 2pm until about 1am. At first we just drove around then we tried to watch Reservoir Dogs at his cousin's house but she made us leave because our running around naked could be scaring to her kids. After that we went to my house to watch Ocean's Eleven and some embarrassing baby videos...ugh...Steph came over and we watched Kill Bill Vol. 1. I'm not completely comfortable with Dane yet but almost. I'm trying but its really hard for me to let my guard down for someone unless I've known them a long time like my family or Steph and Deidra. I'm not used to guys being this close to me. Dane if you're reading this, which I'm sure you will, thanks for being patient."

"event","I woke up late, thanks to my mom. I went with Deidra, found Dane and after a chase he came with us. We hung out at the park and then me and Dane went to swing and left Deidra in the car. We talked for a little bit. Right before we were about to leave so I could change for work he asked me to go out with him. It's about time. I told my mom about it before work and she told my dad. He was pissed and came to see me at work, he wouldn't say anything. I'm 17 I don't know what the hell is wrong with them. When I got home my dad kept asking questions about him and now they want to meet him, I can tell that's going to be fun...meh."

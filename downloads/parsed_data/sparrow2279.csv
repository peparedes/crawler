Jessie and I are going to Mexico. A bunch of people. I can't stand it here anymore, if Acie's gone, I have nothing left here anyways. All year, I've been debating it in my mind. 
People are just generally bad, that's it. I know I'm a bitch to some people, but not the ones I care about. Not unless they do something to me first. But some people just go looking to hurt people. 
I fucking hate people like that. 
And God hates me

It works. Now I just have to teach Ryan. I'm so pissed at Stacy right now. I don't know what she did to him, but he came into school today looking worse than ever. All I know is she was a bitch to him on the phone. Up till now he'd been taking their break-up okay. He actually acknowledged it, which is better than Natalie, last year. But if I can teach him what I've learned over the past four days, I know he'd be happier. I've become able to tell the difference between his ""Attention"" depression and when he's really upset, and that's why I'm so pissed at Stacy. 
Besides that, today was okay...SOLs bite. Geometry was a peice of cake tho. Daniel and I had a nice talk about stuff...made me feel a lot better about myself. You know that song ""My December"" by Linkin Park? Omb, it's exactly what we talked about - how I felt. Plus, tomorrow, Acie and I have lunch together!!! First time ALL year. insane. It's awesome having my best friend back. I really missed her. And Ed's talking to both of us again, since we're talking to each other. LOL - i know, it sounds funny. But I'm just glad I don't have to sit through the assembly from Hell without Acie and Ed. :) (FRIDAY - GAH!)
Football on Sunday was also good for me. Minus the broken toe part :) But it's all good. My team (Beth, JonPhil, me and Rick) WON! Awesome.

"event","Sometimes I wonder if you can fool yourself into acting a certain way, just by deciding to do so. If hope you can. I'm going to try. 
I also wonder why I'm bothering with this. I feel as if I'm talking to someone, but no one's there. 
I had a basically normal day, but I'm still torn between happiness and sadness. My mother hates me, that's a given. (and katie now since I ditched her - sorry katie)

I was at the skating rink, skating around in my little circles, thinking about two people. The first one was Eric, which was why I decided to come home. With the little amount of talking we've done lately, I thought I'd rather be here if he came online, than skating around in circles listening to music from 3 years ago. 

Eric, if you read this, I just want to thank you for being you. When I met you, I was so drawn to you, that I knew I had to do something about it. You are constantly surprising me, and making me feel so lucky just to know you. I wish you could see the way my face lights up when someone says your name. Whether we're joking around, or having a serious conversation, or even if we're not saying anything at all, you are one of the easiest people to talk to. I miss you, Devil Duck. I hope you feel the same way :)

The second person I thought about was Jamie. I wondered what he was thinking. I still do. I could never figure it out. I remember Jackie crying in the bathroom. She blamed herself. That broke my heart so much, even more than seeing Eric almost cry outside. I remembered seeing all those people...did they even know him? I didn't. I was there for Kyle and Beth.
I wonder if he cared what his parents felt, how it would affect Beth. I wonder if he knew how many people would care. But then, how many people sat bewildered and said ""Jamie? Who?""
I wonder why. He was 16. What did he want to do when he ""grew up""? Did he want to be a famous rock star? a teacher? a business man? was he going to get married, have kids? maybe he would have done something really important. 
Maybe he already did.

But maybe now he knows how selfish he was. Did he know Jackie would blame herself, and have no one to turn to but me? She barely knew me, I was just the only person there she knew outside of his family. And she confided in me. What if he had been there, because it had been someone else. He would have known what to tell Jackie. But he wasn't, and too many people were hurt because he wasn't there. 

And Beth.

He took the easy way out, and sometimes it makes sense. 

But most of the time it doesn't. 

It doesn't make sense how you can be happy and sad at the same time. It doesn't make sense how I can't even understand my own emotions. 

It's not my place to talk to Jamie. But I wish he would tell me something. Jamie, tell me if it was worth it. Is it really better now? Did it end the hollowness that made you long for pain? Did that <b>pain</b> ever stop? Do you miss us? Do you ever think about us? Would you come back and talk to us? 

Jamie, do you even know?"

After an amazing weekend, I have to come back, go to SCHOOL and learn things? SOLs start next week...argh! All day long I've been in a daze, just like, ""what's going on?""
I spend my saturday with my awesome boyfriend (hi :) hehe), sunday get a lot of stuff done I needed to, but still managed to have fun, and just lounge around. Then this morning, I go to talk to Dillon and Emily gets mad at me cause I'm too happy for monday! (what is with people being mad at me for being happy?)
Yeah, I just forgot my friend's name...oh it starts with a C. Anyways, we always walk with Acie to class, but today since she wasnt there he asked why...CALEB! That's it. Anyways, he asked where Acie has been lately. I'm so sick of explaining that. ""Yeah, my ex best friend says i'm a self-centered pathetic moronic bitch who makes her want to vomit"" is getting old. But the thing is, I still have to talk to her sometimes. Like this morning I had to give her the tapes from Pat's party. She had some funny stuff on there...
""The Bad Ideas"" - Pat Godfrey
""The Good Ideas"" - Acie Turcott
""The Twizzlers in the Root Beer Can Idea"" - Jesi Parker
Have you ever tried that? of, it's hysterical! We sometimes ese a twizzler as a straw to drink out of soda cans, but when you put them in A&W root beer, it explodes!!!!
:)
Anyways, I was so out of it. Just kinda watched everything happen around me...then Nikki and I had an interesting conversation, but I won't go into it. 

The whole point of this all was to figure out why I feel like it should be the weekend still...but I have enough evergy to be so hyper that Emily gets mad at me. 
Hm.

I have to go to guitar this evening...argh.

Wait, I'm failing a class. I can't find the assignments that I didn't do because I was too busy being happy and talking to my friends. I can't do them now to bring up the grade because at the time they were too insignificant to do. Each one.

HEHE :)

Okay, I'm calm. Yeah, prom was awesome. They should have had a bit bigger dance floor tho, there were too many people in such a small space. It looked big when there were only 30 people, but then everyone showed up! lol...and we thought we were being fashionably late :)
ha! My old english teacher was checking people's names off when I came in, I wonder if she saw Acie. (I loved that class...she was there for about 15 minutes sporadically each day :) hehe)

Anyways, I've got a theory assignment to do, and I gotta babysit, then go to this stupid church band meeting. All the guys play guitar, why do they need me?

"event","Okay, I did it. I got through school. And I actually feel a lot better. I'm kinda cold right now. I don't know if that's related or not. But I only have a few symptoms left. Yaaaay!
Today, I remembered why I am in Theory Class. I love music. :)
I solved a problem that Thomson couldn't get. He was trying to do a real inversion of this wierd 8 measure thing, in bass. (grrr i hate bass) anyways, he'd been working on it all yesterday (when i wasn't there) and couldn't get it right. So I come in today, do it in 30 minutes - (ward and john brill kept distracting me, so it took longer, plus i was zonked out on ibp.) and hand it to him. He couldn't figure out how I did it so quick, and still got it right. (my little secret of RELATIVE inversion transposing as opposed to SEQUENTIAL inversion transposing) It was awesome. It was totally perfect, and I was able to help thomson with his composition. (yes those are my little names for it i have no idea what they're really called, and i doubt they even HAVE names, so I have named them :)~ hehe!)

Gah, I went away for like 2 hours and came back and this was still open. Hehe!

I just got off the phone with Eric :) hehe...I talk to him every day, but it's still just as fun. I don't know what it is, but something seems different about him...but...I <b>have</b> only known him for like three weeks! But on the other hand...he's so sweet.

And I just remembered he'll probably read this. Oh well :-P

Tomorrow is the prom! :) hehe...I'm so excited. Acie was gonna call me back when she called Ed, but he might not be home. I should probably call him. Ed's been acting really strange. I think he actually expected we would go together since we've gone to all the other dances (except the stupid valentine's day where he stood me up, but he apologized...with flowers :) hehe) and I guess he assumed it was a given. I still feel bad about that. But I didn't know! I mean, I met Eric, and if I hadn't, I WOULD have gone with Ed...but like i said, eric's...something special. But anyways, ever since he asked Acie, he's been avoiding us like the plague! He's never at his locker after 2nd anymore, which means I have to REMEMBER his combo to get my book...lol...:) And he doesn't talk to Acie at lunch. She said they haven't spoken since he gave her the ticket! 

Argh...my life has too many guys in it. I don't understand them. Girls are easy to understand, but guys...at least all the ones I know. Especially people like Ed and Ward and Matty. Kenny's a cool guy tho, he wears his heart on his sleve. 

Why does no one ever know what that means?

Anyways, I'm gonna go rest...I feel really tired.

So finally I just called mom and had her pick me up. So I'm sitting in the car with this headache and my throat hurts and etc. etc....and my mom starts telling me I need to clean my room and go to school tomorrow, or I can't go to the prom. Now, school tomorrow? That's not problem...I can last another day. Besides, I feel totally fine now, I'll be fine tomorrow and great by Saturday...

But have my room clean by SATURDAY?

*gasp*

I know, talk about mission impossible...
well call me 007 (or whoever was in that movie :) hehe) because my room is spotless. I actually have a WHITE carpet. And I put the door back on my closet, and everything is organized and off the surfaces and YAY!!!!!

Took me 6 hours. Hehe :)

Anyways, I thought I might get to talk to Eric when he got home, but he hasn't been on...*tear* hehe jk :)

Keith and Ward stayed home from school today too, they kept talking at me while I was cleaning...finally I just turned off the screen and cleaned. 

Odd...ten minutes ago I was freezing in my long sleeved shirt and hoodie, and now i'm in a tank top with the fan on. But see, I think that means I'm better. Cause it IS hot outside, and at least I don't have a fever...

argh I am not going to be sick. My chance to go to the prom as a sophmore, and with a guy i really like, and i got SICK? I will be fine by saturday....

"event","I'm kinda worried about Acie. I mean, I know she's never been a happy person, but lately all she talks about is those fucking pills her mom put her on. And how they make her tired, and don't work, and shit like that. She won't even talk to her mom. Yeah, everyone argues with their parents I know. But Zack realy truly <b>hates</b> her mom. and she's getting mad at everyone else (including me) because of shit her mom does. Like today, I was trying to start a conversation, and she got all pissed off and said I SOUNDED like her mom, cause I kept asking questions. Why should I get yelled at for just trying to talk to my best friend? I never knew that was such a crime. 

Everything you do is influenced by other people, and their actions. Misery loves company. Marley gets upset cause Matt won't talk to her anymore. Yeah, it's been a year! He won't talk to me either. We have reached a conclusion that Kyle is a controlling manipulative liar who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Does that mean Marley has to come in every day in bio and just sit there all sullen? All she talks about is Matty...I don't get it. He's not that great of a friend. I remember back in December, when we were setting up for some drama production, and Eric and Matt and I were sitting there, and he mentioned how Kenny was upset at him for blowing him off for the weekend or something, but Matty said he was hanging out with Kyle, so Kenny should understand. I got so mad. Everyone noticed it but Matt, he's alienating all his friends. He never does anything with anyone but Kyle. He's a bit better now, he does stuff with A.J. and Allie. But that just seems to make Marley more upset cause he goes over to the Coopers and never even says ""hi"" to Marley. Anyways, I remember yelling at him. That was one of the worst feelings ever. Now every now and then, like on the band trip, they hang out and have fun, but all it does is make Marley more depressed. I can kinda relate, which is exactly why I don't hang out with Eric Ward anymore. It's not worth it. 

Matt yelled at me the next day. He said it wasn't right of me to embarass him like that in public, and make him talk about it when he didn't want to, especially since I was wrong. He said I was wrong about his mother saying the exact same things that Kenny and Mar and I were saying. He said I wasn't one of his friends anyways, so he didn't think it was any of my business. 

This coming from the person who I called my best friend besides Acie.

I don't understand all the crap that's happened since last year. Kyle and I were such good friends, we had fun on the bus and everything...then when she introduced me to Eric and Matt, and then Eric got all jealous of Matt, and the football game. God.
Eric and Matt had been friends since Matt moved here. They did everything together, just like Acie and I used to. Now they sit in the same classroom and don't talk. But Matt doesn't talk that much in that class anyways...he just sits and writes notes in that fucking orange notebook to Kyle and composes his atonal polymetric compositions, pausing every now and then to argue with Eric and I about some detail of music. So, I guess he does talk to us sometimes. 

Kyle and I stayed up till 11 over the summer, I remember cause I'd been mowing the lawn, and I came back in and she was online, and I had left a note to her under the door. It had the picture of her, Eric, Matt and I at the skating rink. She gave it to Eric for Christmas. Through me. Not kosher. He got mad and threw it in the trash can. (This was so long ago, over a year. This was when Eric and I were dating) I saved it and took it to her house with a note saying to save it, because she had a real smile, and I hadn't seen that smile since. She came over when I was lying outside on the lawn. It was still light out. We sat out on the deck and talked until 11. 

She didn't talk to me ever again after that. I know even if she did want to talk to me, she'd never do anything about it. But I've tried. I used to say hi to her in the hallway. I used to wave every morning. I know I'm supposed to be kind to my enemies and show kindness to everyone, but a person can only take so much of that. 

How could the actions of one person make four other people so unhappy? (Eric, Marley, Kenny, Matt) Matty made her dinner for valentines last year. (again, LAST year) She blew him off.

I'm so lucky to have Lacie...right now she's the only person I could think of as being a close friend of any kind. I'm also lucky to have Eric, who's such a great guy, and seems to honestly care about me. But Acie's moving, and Eric...well. We'll see.

I don't get it. I miss the way everything was before that all...it was a lot simpler. But I guess that's part of growing up. Dealing with the difficult stuff."

"event","Her hair was up in a pony tail, her favorite dress tied with a bow. 
Today was daddy's day at school and she couldn't wait to go. 
But her mommy tried to tell her that she probably should stay home. 
Why the kids might not understand if she went to school alone. 
But she was not afraid; she knew just what to say. 
What to tell her classmates of why he wasn't there today. 
But still her mother worried, for her to face this day alone. 
And that was why once again, she tried to keep her daughter home. 
But the little girl went to school, eager to tell them all 
About a dad she never sees, a dad who never calls. 
There were daddies along the wall in back, for everyone to meet. 
Children squirming impatiently, anxious in their seats. 
One by one the teacher called a student from the class 
To introduce their daddy, as seconds slowly passed. 
At last the teacher called her name; every child turned to stare. 
Each of them was searching for a man who wasn't there. 
""Where's her daddy at?"" she heard a boy call out. 
""She probably doesn't have one,"" another student dared to shout. 
And from somewhere near the back, she heard a daddy say, 
""Looks like another deadbeat dad too busy to waste his day."" 
The words did not offend her, as she smiled up at her Mom. 
And looked back at her teacher, who told her to go on. 
And with hands behind her back, slowly she began to speak. 
And out from the mouth of a child came words incredibly unique. 
""My Daddy couldn't be here because he lives so far away. 
But I know he wishes he could be since this is such a special day. 
And though you cannot meet him, I wanted you to know. 
All about my daddy and how much he loves me so. 
He loved to tell me stories, he taught me to ride my bike. 
He surprised me with pink roses, and taught me to fly a kite. 
We used to share fudge sundaes, and ice cream in a cone. 
And though you cannot see him, I'm not standing here alone. 
'Cause my daddy's always with me, even though we are apart 
I know because he told me, he'll forever be in my heart"" 
With that, her little hand reached up and lay across her chest. 
Feeling her own heartbeat, beneath her favorite dress. 
And from somewhere in the crowd of dads, her mother stood in tears. 
Proudly watching her daughter, who was wise beyond her years. 
For she stood up for the love of a man not in her life. 
Doing what was best for her, doing what was right. 
And when she dropped her hand back down, staring straight into the crowd. 
She finished with a voice so soft, but its message clear and loud. 
""I love my daddy very much, he's my shining star. 
And if he could, he'd be here, but heaven's just too far. 
You see he was a fireman and died just this past year 
When airplanes hit the towers and taught Americans to fear. 
But sometimes when I close my eyes, it's like he never went away."" 
And then she closed her eyes, and saw him there that day. 
And to her mother's amazement, she witnessed with surprise. 
A room full of daddies and children, all starting to close their eyes. 
Who knows what they saw before them, who knows what they felt inside. 
Perhaps for merely a second, they saw him at her side. 
""I know you're with me Daddy,"" to the silence she called out. 
And what happened next made believers of those once filled with doubt. 
Not one in that room could explain it for each of their eyes had been closed. 
But there on the desk beside her, was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose."

Last night my mom and I got into a fight. I was so mad that when I went into my room I could help it - I had to do something. I almost punched the wall but the last time I did that I made a dent and it was really loud, so I bit my arm instead. Today there's a big mark from it. It really looks like a bite mark. I think that's the first time it's left a mark. It's way better than cutting, this way the marks only stay for a little while, if they even show up, and won't leave scars. The old scars are fading a lot. That's good too, it's been so hot lately...sleeveless shirts all week long.

Same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm said ""If you do what I tell you to, there won't be any harm"" 
And Johnny said ""Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's going to be a little one and she says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fading fast and Johnny hit his knees and there he prayed
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy
Was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old

Now, it never makes me cry because it's sad...it always makes me cry because I think about what it must be like to have that kind of happiness with someone, that kind of love, that you would give your life for them. I don't understand it. I don't think it's really possible - which is what makes me cry. 

I though about Dillon, Rico, Ryan...How have I influenced them? How has <b>my</b> life changed because of them? Has it made me cynical towards that belief...that someone would offer their life because they loved the other so much? After school one day, right after I asked him if he even cared, if he even wanted to be my friend, Rico told me - ""People are only friends with others to get what they want"" ... I think that may be true. The only time I ever recieve positive treatment from a guy is when they want sex...then they leave as soon as they find out they're outta luck. (That reminds me of what Eric said last night...god, i dont even want to get into that now. I thought i'd never hear from him...that might have been easier.)
Anyways, I think rico was right. Yes, you could argue that you have true friends...I'll use Acie as an example. I have never had a better friend than Acie. (I feel so bad for the way I treated Sarah - she was an excellent friend and I was the worst, but that's not for now) Acie will comfort me when i need someone to talk to, can make me laugh more than anyone else (even kenny) is always there, and I know she feels the same way about me...but you could say (back to ricos point) that we are friends to get that feeling from each other - the feeling being needed or the feeling of comfort etc, is what we ""want"" from being friends. isn't it the same thing?
I hate being able to see both sides of an argument, or idea. I think this is why I don't normally talk about these things. i can barely follow my own thoughts, no one else could. 
I hate knowing that I lost the one person who I was most confortable with - all because i was too scared to admit it. (ryan)
and I hate dillon for doing the same thing. 
I wonder if people are lying to themselves when they fall in love. It's too easy to fall in love with the IDEA of love. 

I also wonder why I'm thinking about these things in high school...I'm not going to be the 0.03% who marries their high school sweetheart - I don't even have one! 
Why is it so much easier to be friends with a person, then in a ""Relationship"" (note the capital ""R"")

I can't imagine myself ever purposefully hurting anyone the way that some people have hurt me, which is why I'm not mad at Rico or Dillon anymore - I know they didnt do it on purpose.

As much as we deny it, everyone thinks the world revolves around themself. I think that's why religions like Christianity are so popular today. They always talk about how much God/Christ love <b>you</b> - never mentioning the fact that evolution is not complete - we are NOT the end product.

I think we invented the idea of love to give a name for the way we ""use friends to get what we want"" and with most teenage boys (from what i have seen, sorry to be steriotyping) do just that. 

Now I just let the guy hurt me...I don't think love is ever possible as being completely mutual ... where both people love each other so much that they'd do what Johnny did. (yes i know it's not a real story, but it's my example)

I think thats why my last few relationships have been more physical.

I dont know right now if that's bad or good. i know it's easier...but I also know I'm taking the easy way out.

I'm only 16 - I'm not asking for all the answers.
I don't need answers right now, I just need a game plan...
*sigh*

I turned in my english homework today...i swear, my teacher is the coolest person alive...grades were due this morning, yet he managed to RAISE my F to a D...*sigh of relief*

Of course, I got A's and Bs in everything else...my parents are still gonna be pissed. Oh well. I guess since it's too late to apply to Blair for junior year that it doesn't really matter. 

i'm so upset about this whole Blair thing. I COULD have gotten in, I'm smart enough. It would be just as easy as the academy...minus the people...(not ryan tho...i miss you)
Anyways, I'll live. At least now I get to stay in one place. It'd be a pain going back and forth between jersey and VA.

Well I better go do my hw...german and geometry big time tonite...at least it's not bio or english again...argh

I miss the way you held me 
I miss the way you said ""I love you""
I miss your fingertips and the way your skin feels against mine

Do you regret it? 
Do you feel remorse?
Do you even think of me when you're out on the town making the best of your so-called 
life

I wish that I could hold you
Make you see that you were wrong
To push me away and find somebody else

And I wish you'd come back to me and 
Ask me 
""Will you take me back?""
Just so
I could say
""Sure I miss you, but the last time I fell in love
I got so misplaced and I never found myself again
I don't think I'm ready for that roller coaster ride 
To start messing up my life""

I know, that must be the high point of someone's day! hehe
Well, to sum up everything that's happened since I last wrote-
<ul>
<li>the ski trip sucked.
<li>dillon asked me out
<li>broke my heart
<li>then dumped me
<li>i've applied to private school in NJ for next year
<li>found out I probably won't get in since applications are done for the year
<li>went on an AWESOME trip to AR over spring break, more about that later, 
<li>found with rico/made up with rico/fought with rico....etc
<li>sung at two coffeehouses - both evenings had um...interesting conclusions
<li>made several new friends whom I'll be talking about - john, eric, CH, and other ppl.
</ul>
Well, that's about it. I'm sure there are MANY trivial things I would have written about, had I had the time, but I just dont remember them all now.
I'll try to keep this updated more often, but now I'm mainly on TOD www.teenopendiary.com and don't think I'll have time to regularily do both.

I know, that hurts.

Since Acie and I started our LJ to keep in touch when she moves, I guess i'll be on a lot more soon. I've just been really busy lately.
Acie's moving to texas. 
I don't even want to get into that now
I've been exhausted more than normal lately too. Today I was cause I got up at 5 to take a shower and eat breakfast, then i read for an hour before I finally left at 6:30 to bike to school...in the cold, dark...icy roads. Fun. I had to sign up for Ball. I think Ed's been acting really weird for about 2 months...Whenever I try to talk to him, he's just like, yeah sure...and nods, then goes off to do something else. I don't know, maybe I offended him somehow. I asked him about it about a month ago, and he said he wasn't acting differently. Maybe he's not.
Eric saw me after school, and gave me a big hug...that surprised me. I'm not totally sure why he did it...probably cause he gave Acie a hug when we were walking today, and I pretended to be hurt about not getting one...so i guess he hugged me. It was kinda funny, I'm like, um...hi...

Nine out of ten statistics are made up

Chris pretty much only talks to me online...Ever since the whole Matt Caler incident, he just ingores me in school. Like, i come to talk to him after school, and he'll say hi, but then most of the time he just walks away...kinda the way Eric ""people hops""

I don't want to get all crazy about this, so i'm just going to mention it in passing, just so I can have it as a future reference...
I ditched kenny for mike today :(
Mike ditched his friends for me :)

Well, the only person online talking to me is A.J. Fun
Oh now Ryan's on. He's been going out with Stacy for two days...and his profile says :-D i love stacy :-*
Yuck.

Chris apparently was having a bad day today...He didn't really want to talk to me...(surprise, he never does) but he did laugh at something I said. I don't understand any of this...I mean I'm so frustrated, none of it makes sense. He acts like I don't exist sometimes. I guess if he ever comes to his senses, maybe I'll still be around. 
The trick is...will I care?

So friday at the dance, acie and i picked up a freshman named john, just for the fun of it. We're like, hey do you know how to dance, and he said no, so we're like, great, come dance with us! He hung out with us all night (well till acie left, then he left too) 
Dillian came! It was awesome. He danced with me on the one slow song they played (the dj was a loser, all he had were Rap Promos) and he does this really cool thing where he like rubs his fingers on your back or something, it's hard to describe but it feels really good! Anyways, today we talked for an hour after exams, and talked about how we didn't even like each other before we knew each other. Like, he didn't like me cause of what happened with David (which i still feel horrid about sometimes) and then just cause he didn't know me, and i really just didn't like him cause of some things other ppl had said. but now we're good friends. Except his GF hates me cause she thinks i like him and that he likes me. (neither of which are true!)

Skating was fun, except for this loser guy who hurt my feelings. Acie and I kept skating past him and he smelled really good, and acies like you should go introduce urself and i really didn't want to, cause i'm so afraid of stuff like now what with kenny and chris and everything she's told me (i;ve lost all my boldness and forwardness) but i did anyways and a slow song came on. I go ""hi, wanna skate with me?"" and he got this total look of disgust and was like, uh, no!

Bummer.

I gotta go study for Bio!
Yuck."

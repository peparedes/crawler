 It has been 3 months since my grandpa's passing in November. I remember the exact moment when I heard the news that he had passed. I was in physiology class @ 12:15pm on a Thursday. I got a phone call from my Dad telling me that my grandpa had fallen into a coma, and that it was only a matter of time before he left us. I just remember thinking at the time, ""I'm sorry, I don't have time for this, I need to study for my exams."" ""bye."" And that was it. I went on the rest of the day acting as if everything was fine and dove myself into work and studying. 

The realization that this was all real didn't hit me until I was at Demetrio's house watching an episode of ""CHARMED"" and there was this wise old man talking about how ""death is a part of life."" At that point, I broke down and cried until there was no more tension in my chest. 

Three days later. I was at the Buddhist ceremony at a temple in Lincoln Heights. Throughout the day, the family would cry and yell and grieve as we bowed and listened to those old guys chant loudly and bang cymbals. I saw my Dad cry for the first time that day. I saw my pregnant aunt distraught and near fainting, I looked over and saw tears pour down my older brother's face, I saw my little brother sitting in the corner with his arms crossed and his eyes hard. With all this happening around me, I didn't shed a single tear. 

It wasn't until the day of the funeral that I really just forgot about school and work above other things. The Funeral was held on a Tuesday @ 10am. I remember kneeling in front of the casket alongside all my relatives and brothers, and cousins. Jenny at my side the whole time. I remember kneeling and hearing my 2 aunts wail in pain as a lament for my grandpa. It was hard to bear. Everyone was crying, I look up at the picture of my deceased grandfather and I realize there are tears pouring down my cheeks. I let it overcome me and there was no turning back. Halfway through the ceremony, Jenny turns to me with wide eyes and still lips and asks me, ""am I supposed to cry?"" I answered he by saying, ""you don;t have to cry if you don't want to."" And in that moment her eyes welled and a tiny pitched sound escaped her mouth. She was crying. 

I cried pretty much all day that day. Except for when that dumb priest guy sneezed on the ceremonial roast pig. I saw my grandpa laying in the casket and I let out a huge cry of pain. It was so weird to see him like that so pale, so peaceful. I kept wanting to wait and see if he would just all of a sudden open his eyes and start breathing, but I guess that was just blind hope. 

We drove to the cemetery. I rode in Mike's car with Esther and Mike and Demetrio. It was silent, very little talking all that was heard was the hiccuping gasps that came from me.  We each got a rose to throw on top of the coffin. I knelt by the grave next to my brothers and Jenny holding the rose above my head as I cried and talked to my grandpa. Then it came time to say goodbye. I stood by the side of the open grave and said my final words to him, ""Goodbye Grandpa, Thanks for everything. I will never forget you. I love you."" This was all said in Cantonese. 

I haven't cried since then. After the funeral, while other ppl in the family were trying to cope with my grandfather's passing, I went back to working and studying like a maniac, determined to pass my classes. Whenever a sad thought would creep into my mind, I would push it aside and convince myself I have more important things to do. It's been 3 months since then. I passed my classes and work is slower now, so there is nothing to distract me from my thoughts. 

I just finished reading, ""Tuesdays with Morrie."" It's an eye opening book and it brought me back. I thought about the character in the book who was dying of a fatal disease, and how he was surrounded by his loved ones while he was passing and how he got to talk and cry and reconcile with everyone he loved. I think about my grandpa and how he barely got to see anyone in his final days. Just laying helpless in a hospital bed day after day waiting for it to end. My grandpa wasn't afraid to die. He had told me once that he was at peace with his fate and how he had gotten everything he wanted in this life, and how he was ready to go. He told us not to worry and that he wouldn't come back to scare us. He was a great man. 

The last real conversation I had with my grandpa was in September. I remember him laying on the living room couch like he did everyday. I was cooking some lunch and decided to sit down with him. We talked about my brothers and my parents and about the things he'd seen and done in his life. It was a nice relaxing conversation. 

One part, I will NEVER EVER forget. My grandpa was talking about his happiest moment on that couch. He told me. Once, a long time ago before he was diagnosed with cancer, he was asleep on the living room couch, I saw him there and I went to my room and brought him a blanket and covered him. He wasn't actually asleep, but he said he didn't want to ruin the moment. He told me after I left to my room, That's when he began to cry. he said, "" ""That was when I knew that I was so proud to have such a loving and compassionate granddaughter."" I will never forget those words. 

In the final chapters of the book, ""Tuesday's with Morrie"", when Morrie was breathing his final words, all the guilt all the pain and all the unsaid words came pouring out of me. After 3 months of being strong and forcing myself to move on, I finally continued grieving. My chest hurts and my eyes are sore, but it feels so good to let it out. 

I miss him. He was the only one that truly believed that I was meant to do something meaningful and great. I've continued the grieving process, and I don't know when it will end. But I feel like it's something I just have to finally do. He taught me a lot, I didn't know it then, but those were the words that I would find most precious in my life. I miss him. I loved him. I just wish I could have told him sooner."

"event","So I'm finally posting after a long ass hiatus, to be quite honest, I forgot all about livejournal till now. 

So what's new? ummm...... I'm finally done with Fall semester! YAY!!! I had both Physiology and Chemistry and Math. I was killing myself trying to pull it off. Ultimately, I just gave up on math and focused on what really mattered, the prerequisites for nursing. So it's finally over, and I will NEVER do that again. =D I'm off of school for the next 3 weeks and I'm really excited. I've started hitting the gym again, I'm making plans with old friends, I have time to relax and read. Pure BLISS....=) 

Relationship stuff is goin really well. Just celebrated our 3 year anniversary <3. I'm having loads of fun with him. 

Life is pretty great rite now. all the stress of struggling to stay affloat in my prereq classes are gone, for now. 

On another note, my older bro got into UCR!!! yay!! Congrats to him! I won't be transferring for another year. So I can focus on passing the rest of my classes, and maybe get into a musical before I move on. So if anyone knows of any musicals in the area that are auditioning, let me know! 

Got to see debra a ew time since she left, I really miss her, spain misses her even more! always cryig when debras name is mentioned..... silly spain..... vegas trip was truly awesome. I love their family! So much fun! 

Family life is okay, lil bro is still being a punk, older bro is still away alot, and both of them still like to piss all over the fuckin place in the bathroom and I have to clean it up. =( Parentals are doin alright, dont really see much of my relatives anymore, which I think is a true blessing, and I think I've finally gotten over the shock of losing my grandpa. 

A lot has happened, some good, some not so good, but to be quite honest, if i could, I would change A LOT."

I woke up this morning to find him sitting in a corner all sad and alone. =( Poor thing. he's so sad. Before he left the last time. My grandpa found him and beat him. When I went to go see him today in the yard. he didnt even get up to greet me. He just sat there. eyes all droopy and shaking. I don't know what those awful people did to him or if it was us giving him away so much, but i feel so terrible. He's such a good dog and so loving. I hate to admit it, but I really missed him this past week. He's allowed inside for a while because my grandpa's in the hospital, but not for long. I've had it with my stupid family and their stupid flaky ways. One minute thay love my dog the next, they want him out for one stupid reason or another. Well I've had it. he's MY dog and I won't let them take him away anymore. Stupid idiots. He's so miserable and timid ever since he's been back, he just hides under my bed now and lays there..... =( I can't imagine wut he's been through."

"event","For the past 3 months, I've been going thru a hell of a time taking care of my grandpa. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer a while back and since then it's been one emergancy after another. the cancer is growing fast and it's painful. In the past month alone I've had to rush my grandpa to the hospital 4 times. I know this stuff is common with terminally ill patients, but that's not all. 

 Not only did I take my grandpa to the hospital, I also had to interpret, make all the decisions for him, and explain to my retarded ass family wut was going on and wut had to be done. SO getting a phone call and rushing to the hospital had become a part of my life. 

My grandpa is dying, he recently was admitted into the hospital for a week because he could even swallow water. He had a stent placed to keep his esophagus open, but it's only a matter of time until the cancer outgrows it. =( 

I am now literally in charge of planning my grandpa's last days. My Dad is putting me in the middle and wants me to do everything from taking care of him @ home and staying with him @ hospitals to arranging a place for him in a nursing home and hospice house. 

The past couple of weeks, my house has been a warzone between my grandpa and my dad arguing back and forth about what they want. These arguments would last hours, my grandpa would say something to aggravate my dad and my dad, being as hardheaded as he is couldnt let ANYTHING go. 

People keep saying how strong I am for doing everything and that it's my duty. The truth of the matter is, I'm not strong, I just care about my grandpa too much to say no. ANd no, it's not my duty, everyone else is just not competent enough in my family to know what to do or say, so they put me in charge.

This is very rapidly destroying my spirit. I'm just so tired, all the time. I stay up late at night sometimes thinking about death and dying and what will happen to my grandpa. I've never dealt with the death of a family member b4....

 I care, I really do, but staying involved, right in the middle is driving me crazy. Now evryone in my family expects me to take care of everything! My dad won't even talk ot my grandpa directly anymore, instead he sends me. and its not just my grandpa. He makes ME call my brothers instead of just calling them himself. He expects me to solve his problems for him. 

""He's your fucking DAD! You talk to him! You tell him what you want! Stop using me as your messenger!:
He's your fucking son! not mine u have a problem u talk to him, none of that bullshit! I am tired of it!"" 

SO if I seem out of it l8ly, please forgive me, it's not any of you guys, well mostly never you guys. 

I'm so tired of all the fighting, I'm so tired of the back and forth messaging, I'm just so tired...."

"event","So taking spain and USA's advice, I've decided to re-read all my past journa entries, and I can honestly say I was quite amused. 

 I realized that I was actually a lot more spontaneous and outgoing back then. SO many memories.......... 

It was awesome to relive them in my head again. Thanks BRAIN! =D 

 There were some entries that really made me LOL. Seriously. 

So just a few things, I'd like to mention from my past journal entries that brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. 

- Hating Kaupang

- Leaving choir and joining theatre 

- My 2 failed driving tests 

- Hating math

- WHen my parents had to get rid of our cable. 

- Beating Josh at F.R.I.E.N.D.S trivia

-All the huge hurdles the T.E had to overcome

- the ""BREAK"" <3

- wanting to leave Rowland forever

- My car accident

- Hating Verduzco

- when spain had ""pig"" what happened to that little thing? 

-working 2 jobs and taking 17 units

- I miss getting advice from Mike. 

- Pie making and pizza baking

- our random adventures

 WOW!!! it's been 4 years guys, four years that the T.E has been together. We've been thru a lot that I was sure some things would have definitely torn us apart. SO even tho some of us are leaving(Debra) and some of us aren't around anymore(mike and will). I know the T.E will come together when it matters. 

That's something I've learned from reading all the LJ entries compiled over the last 4 years. And it's a good feeling."

Is it really possible to have that? At least in real life? 
To have someone love you for eternity? It's a nice thought isn't it? Although eternity IS quite a long time.....

 I wonder, can a relationship truly hold that much love and adoration? Where every moment spent together isn't just a moment, but a step towards something greater? 

In a fast pace society like ours, it's hard to stop and appreciate the things around us; especially the people. People always say ""romance is dead."" Maybe it is, or maybe, just maybe we don't see the same things as romantic anymore. 

It's no wonder we're always watching romantic movies and reading touching love story books.
 
Perhaps it's the only vice we have to fulfill that innate need to feel loved and important. I mean of course that we don't run around thinking we're characters from books, cuz those people are a whole 'nother story. =/ What I mean is I guess secretly we want to relate or we feel like we relate to those characters. 

For every girl who has ever wanted to find the perfect guy and always looked in the wrong places, do we not feel like we can relate to the main character? When she spends her nights sitting at home wishing she could find her special someone, don't we feel for her ,and reflect upon our own lives? And for every guy that has admired a girl from afar, do you not wish that she will realize all the wonderful things you've done for her and she will fall madly in love with you? 

Lies, lack of communication, sex, money, and drugs. All factors in the downfall of most relationships. Unconditional love? I think not. 

In perfect honesty, I too want to live happily ever after, but is that really such a realistic ideal anymore? Times have changed. And romance may truly be dead."

"event","A wise person once told to me that there are two types of people in this world. 

Cat and Dog people. As we all know, dogs have a very fun loving nature and are 

intent on keeping others happy. They run right up to you the moment you 

walk through the door and greet you with so much excitement and love.
 
Cats as we all know, have a very cool very sleek nature. They may allow 

you to pet them and play with them, but they want you to fulfill they're 

needs first, if they ""feel"" like it, they'll come to you. 

Very self-centered creature





    Too often we focus so much on our needs that we fail to see that others 

need us. It's not that we mean to seem self-centered or uncaring, it's just
 
that we all have needs that we feel need to be taken care of first. More 

often than not, we think about the outcome to ""our"" problems and ""our"" lives 

first and foremost before anyone elses.
 
There are those that may even ignore that there is a problem to begin with, 

but that's a whole nother story. 




    So what is the point of all this rambling? 

I realized recently that a lot of the times, we take those that we love 

for granted an expect them to be ""our""support system so much that we often 

forget to be ""their"" support system. 

In any relationship whether it be a friendship,family, love, or any other 

kinds of relationship, it's always easier to place the blame or 

want someone else to take care of us, but when the time comes, do we really

reciprocate those actions? 




 Someone also told me once that a relationship is just friendship with sex. 

And everything gets more complicated when sex is involved.

So if a friend needed help or support, we'd give it to them. But in a 

relationship, why do we expect the other person to meet our needs 

first and then give them some support? 




 Because the difference is, with a relationship we are all a little whipped. 

Whipped by fear. I'm sure we can all agree that no one in a relationship

 wants to be dumped, so there are sacrifices to be made, and  you know what? 

we make them. But when one person in the relationship gives so much that the 

other person almost expects to be given everything he/ she wants. That's 

when we become the cats. 




 So the whole point to all this rambling? maybe to vent, maybe to share

 with you some insight? sure, but the truth is, we could all stand to be 

more like dogs in our relationships, and a little less like the cats. Not 

just the romantic relationships, but in ANY relationship."

"event","Should I be a nurse? 
I've been doing some research and it turns out that nurses get paid anywhere from 50,000-80,000 annually. 
That's a LOT more than wut I would get if I were to stay in the child care field. 
I DONT wanna be living at home forever. So i need a job that pays well. and is still important. 
So confused. maybe I should just keep going in the child care field and just take out loans or something. I know NOTHING about loans so if anyone can help. that'd be great. 

Moving out is gonna be difficult with the cost of an apartment, a good one, being so damn high. 
 And with transferring to cal state fullerton, cost of school is gonna skyrocket. 
SO much work! 

Nurse? Child care/preschool teacher? real estate? Interior design? wut to do? 

It's time to start planning for the future.

Vicodin and Morphine make me feel like crap, I have no clue how people can get addicted to it. I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bored being stuck at home. Parentals have no clue somethings wrong with my leg. They just havent seen me for a while, and they see me walking around slowly and disoriented. Last night my dad asked me if I was sick, and I said yea. Then he tried to insinuate that I WAS pregnant AND GOT MAD. HE started yelling and ranting about how clumsy I am and all that shit. Just because I'm sick, does NOT automatically mean I'm pregnant dumbass! and Instead of keeping that thought in my head, it came out of my mouth. My dad was MAD, but I was too tired to care. Actually, I've been throwing up so much from the nausea and drugs, that I can barely eat anything and keep it down. This sucks, I miss class and work, without them I dont feel validated somehow.

"event","Perseverance. The main key to success? 
After nearly a year of working at a dead end job, I realized that this is not what I want. I mean ,I still love kids and teaching, but being a personal caregiver is just too disappointing. Why should I care about a job that renders me overworked and underpaid? 

-My co-workers are ridiculous immature schoolgirls, 
-the parents treat us like babysitters and give us little to NO respect, 
-There are no benifits
-I have no medical insurance, 
-The pay is sadly the same amount as if I were to work at burger king as a burger flipper, 
-My hours are slowly diminishing due to lack of enrollment,
-The job has become so monotonous
-I'm getting fat from sitting on my ass all day on the floor

    I love teaching, and I STILL love kids, believe it or not. =) 
I want to make a difference, but it seems almost impossible when it seems every time I walk through that door, gossip is flying as if I were back in high school again, there are cliques and angry parents in every part of the center. I feel so alone sometimes, everyone seems to be ok with the gossip and ridicule and tension, but I'm not. I grew up my whole life in that type of environment, and I worked my ass off to get away from it, now to be thrown back into it is just so disappointing. 

  I know this is what I want, just not here. I kno, I kno, it's gonna be like this everywhere, and no matter where I go, there will always be someone I dont like or doesnt like me, true, but I'm willing to look for a better place, at least a LITTLE better than what I have now. Hopefully with good health insurance. I want a good stable career for the future, and I kno this is wut i want to do, but just not here. I'll miss those kids. 

I'm planning on quitting once i find another job. In a way this all seems like I failed. PITY.....

So I'm back on the hunt or a job again, nearly a year, not so bad in my book. Longest job I've ever held. *cheers"

"event","it occured to me these past 4 years, that people are often too stupid to realize what they have until it's gone. whether it be someone who doesn't see that someone truely is head over heels in love with them, or someone who finds the little things are grounds for a full on argument, or even those people who are so scared to let go of a dead end relationship because of fear of being alone again. Where does all of this angry talk come from u may ask? Observation. I know, I know, who am I to judge other people's realtionships? right? Well, here's the thing. Due to my past interest in being an advice columnist, whether or not people choose to listen to me, I'm gonna say it. people are unhappy in relationships due to lack of communication. I am NOOOOOOOOOOO relationship expert but by watching other people, and hearing things that go on in relationships, it truly makes me wonder why women aren't stronger than this. Hey! Women!! Stop playing games, stop it! (unless it's foreplay) be strong! Be able to express your feelings no matter how vulnerable u feel afterwards, talk to each other if there's a problem, end it if you know it's been dead for the past 2 years, and lastly, pick your battles. There are no shortcuts, there are no quick fixes. In order to make a relationship work or to effectively end a dead relationship it takes courage. courage to take that step and open up, or courage to know it's okay to be alone sometimes, and move on. sigh, like anyone listens to me, I'm just too dumb to know wut i'm talking about right? u can be the judge of that, I already know the answer."

You can tell when it's time to let kids off the hook, and when it's time to lay down the law.
While your parenting is modern and hip, it's not over the top.
You know that there's nothing cool about a parent who acts like a teenager... or a drill sergeant!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/wouldyoubeacoolparentquiz/"">Would You Be a Cool Parent?</a></div>"

You take a balanced approach to your life.
You definitely aren't afraid to act out on your desires - even crazy ones.
But you usually think first. Morals drive you as much as hedonism does.
You've been able to live a life of pleasure... without living a life of excess.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/areyouidegoorsuperegoquiz/"">Are You Id, Ego, or Superego?</a></div>"

Your job is pretty good, even if it always doesn't seem like it.
You have a lot less stress than most people, and your work environment is definitely above average.
So if you love what you're doing, keep doing it. It doesn't get a lot better than this.
But if you're in a dead end job, you may want to move on. Because if you're not advancing, it's just not worth it.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/shouldyougetanewjobquiz/"">Should You Get a New Job?</a></div>"

"event","Hey loves.<br /><br />So i've been thinking a lot about my life lately, and how much i let it be controlled by my relationships. I don't even mean just romantic ones, just relationships with people in general.<br />Obviously the well being of other human beings, and the wellbeing of their relationship with oneself is bound to be a factor in life and decisions, but i let it affect mine way too much. <br /><br />I made this journal because Ty and i&nbsp; broke up and i was broken. <br />Looking back- i didn't need a new journal for that, one that he couldn't read just so that i could morn and express my pain- i could have kept the old one, and dealt with the consequences of his opinions on my feelings. He caused them, they were the effect and i dont'think i did either of us a favor but trying to be strong when i was feeling pathetic. <br /><br />Anyway, what this long winded entry comes down too is this.<br /><br /><span class=""ljuser""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" alt="""" />angiewavesgbye</span><br /><br />because i'm leaving California and home in August- starting over, and i want a journal thats really about me. How I feel, what happens in my life etc.. not how i think i should feel and what i feel it's okay to admit.<br /><br />add it if you want."

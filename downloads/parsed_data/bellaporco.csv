"event","Oh, my.  It has been a while since I've written in you journal...Things have been a bit mind bending the last month or so.(I'll have to write about this another time!)  And here I am with gradation coming up on saturday.  Of course it does not feel real yet.  I sat in my last classes as an undergrad friday, knowing that I would never again be part of that atmosphere...a class filled with kids who wear what ever they want, talk and giggle, eat their lunch, strut in and out...so different from high school.  That was one of my absolulte favorite things about college...you were finally treated as an adult.  You were paying all this money and taking college level coursework, so now you are entitled to do things your way.  
I must admit, Ive lately looked around and missed my old style...worn out cords, funky blouses and funny t-shirts from thrift stores.  Yet another thing I can't wait to get back to now that I'm graduating.  
I'm letting it all ride this summer...one full time job on campus, real laid back....and the rest of the time is mine...the beautiful weather is mine...oh how I love the summer!  Hot and sticky and bright!  
I'm branching out....trying things I was herto afraid of...I'm a big girl, and my success in college has taught me nothing more important than the fact that I can do and be anything if I have the right attitude about it.  So I wait for these last four dreadful days to tick by....tick-tock-tick-tock..."

"event","I was just thinking that I should get some of my girlfriends on this thing.  Then I could check out what they're up to, feeling, etc.  
Broke down and called Jack.  Said he would call me in a few days.  We'll see.  I don't think he will. Sadness. I had gotten to really like him.  I'll miss him alot.
Got to eat all this yummy, fatty food today.  Wynne brought cake into the lab today.  Then I can home and made a scalloped potato casserol.
Cool new news, Zach mentioned today that he needed to know the peak day of activity from my current experiment for writing the abstract to send to ASM.  Meaning, my research may be published in a major, major scientific journal!  Kind of makes it easier to aerate those damn fungus cultures every day.  
A plane crashed in a neighborhood 5 miles outside JFK airport in New York today.  No evidence of terrorism, but coincidental that the area had a shortage of fire fighters and rescue workers because it was an area where alot of people from the WTC attack had died.  This stuff is getting really freaky.  Getting me freaked out about going to Mardi Gras this year..."

"event","I'm looking at the future of this semester and the next with new hope.  Having the cable internet is helping out alot, and I also talked to a few friends last night for a few hours.  Michelle and Lee mostly, and I stopped by the dorms to visit John.  He wanted to take me out to dinner today, but after work at Dover's I have to TA from 6 to 9.  Well, 9 PM is when I'm going to cut it off so I can go home and rest.  Got out of Dover's a bit early, used the spare time to go to the lab for an hour.
Really excited again about my lab job also.  New perspective: This is MY project, and if I want to do new stuff maybe I should be taking the initiative to do research on my fungus and finding out proceedures for doing the things that I want to do with it!  maybe that's all Zach has been waiting for and has been giving me all this dumb cleaning work b/c he thinks I just want to get my hours in and am too busy to concentrate on a new project.
Also looking foreward to maybe getting my grades back up in a few classes.  I typed up introductions for every physics lab for the rest of the year and when I told my TA he just had the biggest smile for me.  I think I drive him crazy with all my questions every week.  I'm just not satisfied withe the ""because"" answer that most other students are. So I end up staying late every week so I can do good on the reports.   
Dishes and laundry almost done.  I get to come home tonight and watch the Simpsons that I'm taping and maybe paint my nails and give myself a facial.  Maybe work on a little light homework before I go to bed.  
No call from Jack.  No call from Steve.  That beta male either just wants to get in my pants, or is completly stupid to realize why I left friday night.  Or maybe he's annoyed because every time I hang out with him I get drunk.  Well, duh! Stop giving me drinks and acting like you're going to get all drunk with me and then get all sober!"

"event","I like being baby sat.  Maybe that is why Anna is working with me and Felicity on saturday.  That will be LOTS of fun.  
So I quit.  I just couldn't take it any more.  Too many hours, too much stress.  I've become such a cranky bitch I don't even recognize myself sometimes.  
I am SOOO looking forward to Thanksgiving break now.  Spend the whole weekend"

"event","So I'm trying out this new online journal thing...hmmm...cool.  I like haing the foxy little mood option.  Makes me feel saucy.  Kind of like the chinese food me and Felicity just got from House of Ing.  Yeah, alot of things like that happen here at the DC.  
Got to get on that Halloween costume.  The cigarette girl still has no velvet lined box to carry her goods in!
Heard there was a big party in the town homes last night.  yep, fightin' an' drinkin'and the cops came and lot o' them residents says they're movin' out!"

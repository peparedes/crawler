i went to the ocean county mall today for the free ftsk show. we woke up at 530 and left at 6 and got there by 8. they let us in at 3 and ftsk was on at 5. i would only do this for them. i made them all cupcakes, got them candy, and some stuffed animals because that's what they like. i also got them capri sun. yes. surfer cooler in case you were wondering. my mom talked to robi for me and he hooked me and nicole up with a meet and greet because i had all the stuff and made the street team shirts. they really enjoyed it, i could tell. now im sitting in the royal hawian with nicole falling asleep on the floor. it is disgusting here. a breeding ground for hivz and a new breed of herpes. i refuse to take of my sandles or go to sleep. refuse.

we lurked around the near by hotels and went into their gift shops. you should see some of the crazy things they sell in places like that. the bracelets are out of this world (=

didnt think so.
anyway. i had an amazing adventourous day today with steph, forte, and miki. really though. we basically walked across a desert to get to mikis grandparents house, where he showed us that he could make stained glass! then we went movie hopping and saw the zohan, the hulk, and kung fu panda! then the burlington center mall had to put up with us for an hour before my mom picked all our asses up.

then the carnival rolled around and we all hung out there. a lot of people from school were there, but i dont talk to them, so i didnt bother lol. i saw that kid sean i met through forte. he was really drunk but it was kinda funny! i wish i had run into him again cuz i wanted a laugh!

this is weird. i've done some things this weekend that i think have changed my prespective on things.  nothing major, but enough. it was enough the realize that putting myself back in that situation only makes me think about old things again, and they are things that I know i shouldn't think about. whatever. i think now i am past all of that, or i hope i am. if im not, i know i will be soon because i can feel the detachment from it all, and as sickening as it is, im enjoying this new life. i've met more people and done more things in this span of four months then i have in the last few years. phenomenal. 

something that really helped me was a movie i watched, called dans paris, staring louis garrel among other french actors. it was moving, and just the way it was shot showed me life, real life. it didn't have a flow, it just happened, everything in the movie happened without me expecting it. that is what life is all about. that is what it is all about.

over and out tour june 19 philly at the troc.
this show was amazing because there was basically only 10 people there as well as only me and my friends being the ones paying attention. they dedicated a song to my little group because we were hardcore into them, and that was my favortite show memory. john even shook morgs hand the entire becky starz song. talk about sweet! ahah and we got to chill with them and upper class trash afterwards. we showed them how we drew all over the sidewalk! we even met the coolest guy, eric, who is an awesome photographer!

alternative press tour april 10 philly at the tla
this show was amazing because we had to leave school early to get in the line really early. we kept trying to sneak around back to see if they were there but security was being a dick. we got inside and had an awesome time rocking to their opening set. as soon as they were over, caleb threw his water bottle into the crowd and i had to wrestle a bitch for it lawlz. austin tried to throw his pick to emily, but some ho in front of us caught it instead lol. after wards we were on a mission to find every member to met them again. we found jonathan first and he was awesome, then marc, then kdirty, then austin, then kyle, but no caleb or kent /: we decided to skip atl just so we could find caleb and kent! we snuck around south street for a good twenty minutes, and then snuck behind the venue, where scuz and caleb were chilling! omg. we got our picks and bolted. security was a dick that night!

bamboozle may 4 east rutherford at the meadowlands
this was an amazing show because it was people from all over come to see them! jeffree star and jeffree the winner of project runway were on stage with them the whole time! lol. woot. and i skipped their last song just so i could go and find them to meet them again. sadly, they only came out for like.. point five seconds and i missed them, but i did get a wave from scuz and robi !!! and austin kept looking at me funny ahah. i did give kdirty all the beef jerky i bought for them and he was freaking out. he told me they would love it! and he asked me what my name was so he could tell them who gave it to them (: yay.

now. conan.!

february 2nd, 2008. im finally a year older, and i feel so different already. this means only 14 days until my big bash, 14 days until the best night of 2008 !! this will be great. 

ive decided to be happy, and i am. it is working better then i thought it would, thank god. suprisingly, my mood isn't so shaky as it had once been. its thanks to nicole and alexis for the comforting and extraordinary help. oh, and i have been getting very close with nicole. it is a great feeling, to have her there. i enjoy it.

oh and fashion week has started. my favorite site <i>ever</i> is blogging about it. check it out every chance you get.

so, a lot of thinking and talking has been taking place. yeah, mostly talking to myself and people who have the time to listen. its sad, but that is how my friends have turned out to be. what can i say? once with bad taste, bad taste will never leave you.

oh, i know i am wrong. no need for reminders.

but i cant stop thinking about how angry this makes me. sorry, but im not going down so easily. wait, im not sorry. apologizing is worthless.

Break is over. It is 4:16am and I have no inclination to sleep. I am listening to sky eats airplane on my zune, singing under my breath, trying to translate french websites, and watching iron chef on mute, all of it a ploy to distract me from realizing I go back to hell (school) in two hours. hmm. I wish I could stay on break forever because I like feeling less stressed. Tomorrow means make up tests, four to be exact, over due projects AND homework, and friends I miss desperatly. I guess there are pluses to break ending, but I am currently ignoring such pluses.  

Saturday morgan and sherri had another party. I was there for a few hours until they moved it to sean hicks house. I was already planning on leaving, so I just left early. Apparently, I missed a lot, and yestarday morning I realized I had. Mostly, drama. Not an impressive feat, by my standards, but an expected one. Nothing suprised me, except how said drama was handled yestarday. Its almost sad, but I promised sherri and nicole I would stay out of it. Its for the best, anyway, if I did. 

Friday was a drive around day. I can truthfully say that we know the entirety of south jersey because of the adventures we have been on in sherris car. Its amazing how many people can fit into her car, actually. The worst part of friday, and funniest, was the exploding frappacino. It ruined my purse, but it gave us an incentive to stop in the middle of mtown in a huge development. We were loud and I hope we woke everyone of them up. 

There are things I won't talk about here, but ill put it clear that I feel things between me and a certain someone are a little strained. I know why, but I can't solve it, and I won't. It will bring no good for it to be solved, it would only cause more problems. If you catch my drift.

Ok, so I have recently become obsessed with the OC. Does that sicken you? Personally, I love how Ryan can portray his emotions without talking! Its like BAAM and his eyes smolder you. BAMMMM! And seth can always make me laugh.

Oh, I guess that makes me finished."

"event","ok, where to begin? first off, this is from my sidekick so fuck you for hating my spelling and whatnot. 

secondly, i don't even know, and that is the end of it. one day i am fine and the next, i want to run away. it is not all the time though, just on occasions and i try to tell people but i can't really come across saying what i am seriously feeling. it is seriously annoying. blah, fuck me and my inconstancy to speak my mind. fuck the people who can't take the time to be real friends and care. fuck the life i lead that i know isn't real. and fuck me again for just going along with it. seriously, fuck me. 

i went to a show on the 27th. it was valencia, armor for sleep, four year strong, the high court, and the triangle shirt factory. the show blew me away, as shows usually do. four year strong exploded the crowd as did armor for sleep and valencia. i was there for the high court, really. they amazed me and i can't wait to see them at the cue club. at the show, we saw emily, after we got a ride from sherri instead of her. she missed the first two bands and if that had been me and morgan, we would have murdered her. it all worked out in the end, really. i had an amazing spot to stand and i got valencia's drum stick.  

i saw sweeny todd today. i must say, johnny depp has once again floored me with a flawless performance. really, he stuns me with houw versitile he can be. his roles differ from each extremity to the next, and yet, he never loses that johnny depp twinkle. he can be manic, cunning, drunken, witty, dramatic, shy, developmental, drastic, and serene, and i can't even think of what else, but its the whole damn truth. i went with my dad, which was nice, except for the fact that he kept whispering to me what was going to happen. seriously !

oh and i went to get my hair cut and the girl i usually see was out with the flu and i almost had my hair butchered by some old hag. i like young people to work with my hair, thank you very much. so i made an appointment for next week. 

it is not likely for me to go out for a while. i do not feel up to it. not at all."

I would not be surprised if you walked away right now. Besides, I don't like getting the hopes up when they can easily be brought down by a worthless scum bag. You want to test me out? Baby fucking pull me and see how your lifes ends. 

I've given up impressing. lol. If that's even the fucking word. 

I have a lot on my mind and I'm posting this from my sidekick so its gonna be all bad grammer, but do you care? I will probably be the only one to read this. I can't remember the last time I actually laughed. When I say laugh, I mean from the bottom of my heart. You keep my smiling, no doubt, but I consider that a waste when you can't move me in hilarities. Aren't we always saying how you've got to be funny to be something. Whatevez, I live and push through it.

I'm waste deep now, no longer standing in a puddle. I feel like I'm wading for something that will never come. Wading.  Not waiting.

What fucking ever!
I'm fucking shaking. Shaking!"

"event","<p><font size=""1"">I hate when bands break up. when i say hate, i mean i absolutly loath. some current examples of broken-up bands are leftover and upperclass trash. only&nbsp;a year ago, acceptance broke up. What is with it? i understand that sometimes bands break up because personal matters and the fact that the music industry may not be the place for them, but do they consider their fans? do they understand that they are leaving behind loyal people who really enjoy attending their shows, spreading the word about them, and obsessing over their beautifully written music?&nbsp;<br /><br />maybe not but i know that whenever a band breaks up my heart aches even if it is just a little bit. ughh...! i absolutly hate it.<br />do you agree?</font></p>"

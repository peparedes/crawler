Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
So I will not forget. I will not forget
How this felt one year six months ago
I know I cannot forget. I cannot forget
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you
I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you
So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you
Memories of you"

"event","I've been lazy for awhile and havn't written...so this might be long.

I'm so thrilled that its spring break I can't really express how much. I have a lot of school work to get done (bio test, reading, and writing) but I'm just so glad I don't actually have to step foot in that building. It's also a well needed break from certain people that have been annoying me lately. I'm sure thats the same for many people.

Anyways, many people are away. I don't have anything exciting planed except for going to Syracuse Thursday to Saturday. I'm looking foward to going...just not the 5 hour trip with my ENTIRE family...actually I'm quite dreading that part..I'll have no escape..for two full days...Lord Give Me Strength!
(So note to all my friends: Text me or call me during those days..help me stay sane! PLEASE!)

I got my prom shoes..and I love them as much as I love my dress. :)
Very Awesome

Went to go see ""The Whole TEN Yards"" yesturday with Lynn and Tony..VERY funny movie...Matthew Perry's faces CRACK ME UP! lol

Soo now its Easter and I'm with my moms side of the family thank god. Everything is so calm..people cracking jokes all the time...its not like the other side where things are hostile and full the rememberance that my grandmother's not there. I've been thinking about her so much...and it gets me so sad.
She must be turning over in her grave with all the shit going on lately. I do my best to make her proud..thats all i can do i guess.
I wish others would think about that too..but I can't change everyone.


ANYWAY...I might audition for ""Footloose"" at this theater in Edison with my friend Grace...still debating it..I love the show..but I dont wanna waste my time either..I'm sure it would be a good experience either way.

Well I must go...I wanna find my aunt's stash of peeps! hehe

Happy Easter Everyone!"

"event","These days seem all the same to me lately and the weeks are just flying by. Now I have soo many big things to look forward to..but I want them all to come now because of how much i've been suffering from boredom.
This weekend was pretty cool.
Friday I went to Hooters for the first time with MDC; a must needed outing with those girls because I for one havn't hung out with Jess since before play and basketball..SO it was nice. We had fun. Well Hooters was just ok but the night was good overall.
Saturday I rejoined kickboxing which was well needed because of how gross I feel about myself lately, plus i missed it and needed to join something to keep me busy.
Then for 6 hours I went prom dress shopping and after about 15 dresses I found my love. Its a red dress that I had to order...a very different look for me..and its very bold for me..so i'm surprised i love it so much.
Getting my dress got me in the best mood and now i'm totally excited for prom. Like I said in a past entry..the dress for me is the best part of prom. Everything else is just ok. 
I've had someone on my mind a lot lately...so my sleep has not been too great. I try not to think about it because then I begin to wish for certain things..and sometimes wishing only hurts you more. So Blah BLah Blah enough about that.
This whole daylight savings time sucks by the way..I feel so lethargic. I think if it weren't for the screaming baby keeping me awake, I would have passed out on Mal's shoulder at church this morning..that's how tired I was.
Anyway Spring Break starts in a few days and the count down for that will help me get through school I pray.
I have a lot of work to do yet today..but do i care? NOPE..but what else is new?
Umm...thats all i gotta say for now...i think..well I'll post again later.

Ciao!"

This past weekend was completely unsatisfing..thats the only word to describe it, well boring can fit too.
Friday night wasnt too bad I guess. Drove around to Pat Benitar and went to dinner with the girls, which was lovely. I'm in love with Houlihan's baked potato soup. Yummm ;)
Then I went to see ""Godspell"" with Alicia, which, well...was two hours of confusion and pain honestly. Grace was good...but the show was TERRIBLE. 
My trip to the Poconos was relaxing..but I was bored and wound up just eating a lot of food. Just what I need...heh
I got home around 8:30 and was just too tired to go out..
Sunday, I went to my cousin's show, which was amazing as I predicted and I got upset because I was wishing so much I could be up on stage with them. :*(
SO yea...i don't wanna go see another show for awhile.

This week has started off well. Getting [most] of my work done, and I'm almost done with my scholarships which is exciting. 
Things are good with my prom date and I...which is AWESOME. As long as we're talking and theirs no weirdness..I'm happy. SO i'm happy

ok..i just attempted to download an 80s dance mix for Prince's ""Lets Go Crazy""...and I got Jimmy Eat World's ""Sweetness""..lol cool anyway..but not what I wanted...maybe this is a sign that I shouldn't download anymore. lol
Ahh...listening to Jimmy reminds me of DTS...when I went with Kate..and I listened to that entire CD seriously a million times..good times ;)        ::sigh::

I got my pictures back from the show. They're amazing! I can't wait to put them in my scrap book. :)

I hope this week goes fast...I wanna have a fun weekend, cuz I NEED to!!! So we should plan something cool that I could look foward to.

OOOO More to put on my list.. (hehe ..the list keeps on growing)
Aprip 16- trip to see Syracuse. totally excited
July 3- cruse to the Bahamas..I'm finally getting out of the country!!! yay

That's all I have to write about as of now..I think I'm missing stuff..but its not important..my life's not THAT interesting..lol

Fortunately this week went fast.
Today was fun. Performed for the high school today..although it was nerve racking at first, it was an overall good time. I'm happy we ended on a good note...but i'm D-O-N-E...DONE with Diana Maralis and ""Nothing"". I don't think i've ever been more sick of a song.

Anyway, this week turned out to be not as boring as I predicted. I spent some time with an old friend..somebody who i care about and always will...even though things are different between us. I can't explain why I still feel this way...but I don't feel I have to explain myself to anyone either. Nobody can really understand even if they tried..but enough bout that.

So yea..umm..this weekend is not going to be that thrilling but not the worst ever.
Tonight I'm going out to eat with some of the girls and then going to see ""Godspell"" at Immaculate Conception. I hope the show is good..I'm just going to support my friend Grace..she came to see me after all.
Tomorrow I'm headed for the Poconos to visit my grandmother for her 75th birthday. Just a day trip..
that's because Sunday I'm going to my cousin's in upstate NY to see her show (""Hello Dolly""). I'm actually excited to see that because she comes from one of those affluent towns where the drama dept. probably gets $20,000 to put on a show, so it'll probrably be amazing..well amazing for a high school.
So basically, I won't see anyone this weekend. I'm sorry guys..hehe

On a happy note I have another event on my list of things to look foward to.

June 25th- Incubus at Madison Square Garden!!!!
I hope we get those tickets! Brandon Boyd is MY dreamboat..oo baby. lol

Closing Remarks:
I need a job...money...and i wanna get shmammered..lol

"event","So last night was the first night of my last show. Went well i suppose. I personally messed up, but unless the audience had the script in front of them, they didn't notice. Egh, i just beat up on myself. So many people I knew were out there. Grrr. 
I think we're all doing a fantastic job overall but idk ...i'm just not overly excited performing it. Nothing will ever compare to last year and that feeling i had when the audience gave us a standing ovation at the end of ""Footloose.""  NOTHING...heh how i ironic that that's the name of my song...""i felt nothing""...its pretty much been my motto for this show. Will we get that ovation tonight? Hopefully-- i mean we worked hard enough..but who knows?

Afterward was the traditional Friday night cast party at the Alicias. I was tired and upset that we had the video of the show..but its her house so i guess i had to let her do what she wanted to do. Whatev. So i was in and out of there frequently..but we were told if we didnt want to watch it, to leave...so thats what i did. I didn't want to seem rude..but i really wasn't up for it.

The weirdest thing happened at Alicias tho. I left to go to Wendy's with Laura and on the front steps is Bridget (fellow cast member), with Peri Martinez and this other kid. i looked at the kid and thought he looked familiar...but i tend to think everyone looks familiar to me. lol Anyway hes lookin at me and he asked me what my name was as i walked by... well not being the greatest mood i kinda pretended i didnt hear him (lol) and then he shouts that his name is Scott and he knows me because i took the SATs in front of him back in OCTOBER..i was like holy shit. I mean he looked the same i guess but that day i took the SATs i just rolled out of bed and went there looking like shhiiiiit....at Alicias i still had all my costume makeup on..So that was really freaky that he remembered exactly where he knew me from. WEIRD..haha

Today as of 3:25 has been really good. Woke up at 7 a.m. to go to F.D.U with Shannon for the Zonta Club's Young Women Invitational Symposium. I didn't really know what I'd be doing there at first but it was a group of junior and senior girls from different high schools in Bergen County. We watched two speakers who talked about our dreams and passions and it was really so inspiring. We went to two workshops, one about having a positive image of ourselves and eating healthy. The other was about our different personalities and what values we have that help us make choices in life. That one wasn't too great but they tied in the musical ""Wicked"" and the soundtrack into the presentation...and i love that stuff so i was attentive. i hear the singing and im at the edge of my seat..lol i know..im weird.
From Wood-Ridge it was me, Shannon, Jessica Espino, and Francesca Candela. They're sweet girls and during our breaks we met the nicest girls in the world. It was soo refreshing i guess i should say, to discuss all the different topics with them. The one girl reminded me of Alissa...she was funny, and she had long red curly hair..and she made fun of her boobs a lot..lol I was like holy shit you could totally be my best friend!

There was one speaker there, her name was Nancy Ellison. She spoke about how we should respect ourselves and she said:(i wrote this down because i loved it)

""Are you the subject of your own life, or are you the object of someone elses?""

When she said that, it just hit me, because I relate to it so much lately. Nobody should ever have the power over somebody else's happiness. I have to make decisions that are 100% my own. Its MY life.

Wow ok so I wrote a book today..lol

I probrably won't write for awhile.

Last perfomances tonight and tomorrow afternoon. Wish me luck!"

Ok i'm not once speck Irish..but its still special.

Today was a typical day..nothing too exciting happened.

Been thinking a lot about next year though.
I'm 95% sure i'm going to Syracuse..i don't know the reasoning really for that other 5% but its there...lingering in my head. I think i'm just really scared to make that ultimate final decision.
I still feel like im a freshman or sophomore..only not as naive.
Now less then 3 months from today i'm gunna be walking across that stage. Same stage I walked across for my preschool graduation, by the way. (isn't that cute?! hehe)
Basically, I'm totally ready to move on...but it's hard for me to imagine myself not seeing the same faces everyday.

Every single one of my friends is special to me in one way or another. Making me laugh, always making a scene where ever we go. Ahh i love them all. I'm scared I won't find such great friends when I go away. I don't really trust people too easily and I know thats so important when you're trying to make new friends.I know it will be hard at times, but I hope we all make an effort to keep in touch when we're away.

  Honey & The Moon

Don't know why I'm still afraid
If you weren't real I would make you up
now
I wish that I could follow through
I know that your love is true
And deep
As the sea
But right now
Everything you want is wrong,
And right now
All your dreams are waking up,
And right now
I wish I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom,
Where no one lives.

Remember when we first met
And everything was still a bet
In love's game
You would call; I'd call you back
And then I'd leave
A message
On your answering machine

But right now
Everything is turning blue,
And right now
The sun is trying to kill the moon,
And right now
I wish I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom,
Where no one lives

Freedom
Run away tonight
Freedom, freedom
Run away
Run away tonight

We're made out of blood and rust
Looking for someone to trust
Without 
A fight
I think that you came too soon
You're the honey and the moon
That lights
Up my night


But right now
Everything you want is wrong,
And right now
All your dreams are waking up,
And right now
I wish that I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom
Where no one lives

Freedom
Run away tonight
Freedom freedom
Run away
Run away tonight

We got too much time to kill
Like pigeons on my windowsill
We hang around

Ever since I've been with you
You hold me up
All the time I've falling down

But right now
Everything is turning blue,
And right now
The sun is trying to kill the moon,
And right now
I wish I could follow you
To the shores
Of freedom
Where no one lives"

Still avoiding Ms. Baumgartner (however ya spell it)..owe her $52 for the candy sale ..now i know what it must be like to be a crack addict owing the dealer money...lol. Avoiding eye contact at all cost. dear god that woman is insane.

I have dress rehearsal tonight...too tired for it..but i'll deal. Too bad all this practicing might not even be worth it...we're no where near sold out. Figures. 

Well, i'm still in an overall good mood from my great weekend. Hopefully it lasts a little longer..but thats doubtful. I'm so upset about prom, I don't even want to go anymore. I just don't understand and I try and try..and i'm at the point of giving up and not going.

"event","Well, first off I must say I feel kind of hypocritical starting this live journal. I said I never would..but I just have so much on my mind lately and so many emotions this is the only way I can express it. I tried regular journals in the past, but my little sister always seemed to find it no matter how hard I tried to hide it and then share it with my mother or better yet her friends. Lovely right? I probrably won't update too frequently, I'll be honest, I'm super lazy lately.
So let me explain my life as of this past week...

The now 3 month countdown to graduation finally hit me.
This week had two huge ""senior"" events that came and went so quickly, it's hard to believe that they're over.

The first was Youth Day on Tuesday, not the most exciting, but it was cool to see the inside of the real curtis i guess. I must thank all the friends of mine that made that day bearable. WE had the ""fun table""...i needed all those laughs that day. Screw the PHDB with her dirty looks...laughing never hurt anyone..lol

The second was the fashon show on Thursday. All the work the mothers did really paid off and it was really successful. I had a good time despite my fear of tripping down the run way. I can really be a clutz at times. Anyway, afterward a group of the seniors attempted to go to the Meadowlands Racetrack. Well that didn't work out but we still had fun in a nearby parking lot. lol Its great that our mixed cliques in the class can get together occasionally to have a good time. 

Play practices have been daily and long..
I love this stage of rehersals..the lights are on..we're focused..ahh i love it i love it....and i really get upset thinking that its almost over...i can't imagine never doing this again in my life. 

ok.. can't cry...now onto a happier subject.

Saturday had to have been one of the best days in my life.

Practice was fun. It was our first dress rehersal. I'm totally self consious in my costume but i guess i have to just suck it up. The boys cracked me up when they came out on stage to do the final number in just their boxers and the hats..got some great pictures of that thank god..lol

During play practice however, my mom pulled me aside. After months of agonizing aticipation i got my acceptance letter from Syracuse.
I just saw the big envelope and broke down. I couldn't believe it and i'm still pinching myself not sure if this is real. I just sat there and screamed and cried...i guess because I prepared myself so much for a regection letter I was just completely totally blown away; not knowing how to deal. This is now going to be a very hard decision making process for me. I have to weigh the pros and cons for Syracuse and St. Joe's.

Don't get me wrong, Syracuse has been my ""dream school"" since last year, but now the reality of actually being 5 hours away and not seeing my friends all that much is really settling in. Also the fact that St. Joe's is soo much more affordable for my family. Damn this sucks.

So without a doubt the only thing i wanted to do Saturday was party..so therefore i made sure that happened! lol

So, i grabbed Judy and Alissa, and we went to my friend Vlad's house in Nutley. He was having his coming home party from college and we really had a good time.
Judy's so frickin friendly i love her, and Vlad's friends were all really funny (well drunk) so that kept Aliss entertained while i got to spend time with Vlad. He's so damn cute. Sigh..

egh..hes a really great guy, but I'm just trying to have my fun.

He's in college, i'm gunna be in college soon. Why start a relationship now? I've had enough of guy problems this year...so untill further notice, there will be no attachments. I'm just avoiding being hurt at all costs..lol

I guess untill after this play is over we'll start really woring on prom details. So many things to do and we're just procastinating the issue..well what else is new.

Things to do:
1) talk more with my date...heh
2) get limo
3) get a dress

im sure there's more...

well im tired, sore, and suffering from a major case of senioritus. I need a vacation.

Thats all for today folks"

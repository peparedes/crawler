"event","So I am currently in a hotel room in the middle of Pennsylvania wide awake at 1:30 in the freaking morning. Now I know it doesn't seem too terribly late, but for me lately this is way past my bed time. I am up here for a long weekend family vacation. Now the note to myself that I will make after this entry is to not drink or have coffee anything 5 hours before bed. I am completely wide awake and no one else is and I am bored. So this is going to be a long entry to fill in with everything that has happened to me over the last little bit of my life.

School ended in May. I came home thinking I was going to have decent hours at the radi station and possibly pick up a second job, while also managing to help out a band on a small part of tour. Ok lets see here. My boss at the radio station ended up not being able to give me many hours what soever and come to find out he just got a huge promotion job up in Boston, so in conclusion he doesnt care anymore and he is not my boss anymore. I am totally stoked for him and his new job though! He totally deserves it. Second job status... Applied to work at a venue downtown and the douchebags never contacted me back. After making me drive downtown for an ""interview"", didnt even meet with me, then never answered any of my emails! Way to be fucking professional about the hiring process, JERKS! Then, the whole tour bit, I never received a definitive response about anything so I am assuming everything is falling through, just like the rest of my summer. SWEET!

Positives. Mad hangs with awesome people has made everything ok. Getting to see niki on a consistant basis has been really relieving, because I just dont see her enough throughout the school year :( And beach adventures and girlie nights have kicked ass! Hopefully these times will continue to happen the rest of summer.

Music. So I recently gave in and picked up the new Paramore album. Can I just say how freaking awesome it is. Everyone knows in the past I am NOT, let me repeat, NOT a fan of girl singers fronting a band. But, this album is so freaking catchy. Now if only she can get over whatever she has everytime im set to see them live, and they bail, then they may be completely back in my good graces. Also, a band called The Years Gone By has caught my ear, go check them out. Ohh and can I say how upset I am that I am going to miss seeing Jesse Lacey at Common Groundz Coffee House for an acoustic set on July 31st, because I am an idiot and didnt get a ticket before they sold out. So I think I am going to go sell my soul to them for anything they need just to let me into the show. Also, common groundz pretty much is amazing, and the working title there also rocked my socks!

Wants. I desperately want a new phone! Holy cow does mine stink. I dont think it is normal to have to recharge the damn thing like 5 times a day. And that is not an exaggeration. Also, it laggs like a bitch and I just hate it. I want the EnVy or Treo! Hook me up yo! I would also like a little more money in my bank account. But who doesnt.

Boys. None. Where is yellow short, paper boy hat, richmond boy? come back in my life please!

So now I am totally watching my super sweet sixteen, and absolutely hate these girls. Holy shit, lets just be a little more self centered whining spoiled little brats. Geeze, appreciate life a little more. Because you didnt get a fucking Jag for your birthday, which by the way you cant even drive yet, dont cry about it. Be a little more grateful. I cant even comprehend or put into words how mad they make me.

Well, I hope that is enough of an update. I could probably ramble on for another hour or two. But Im sure you have had enough.

"event","This time was completely different. I was happy. Not that I am not right now, it was just different. I had an attraction towards a boy that I had never had before. Last year this time, I was talking in the civic, sunroof back, under the stars. Learning, laughing, growing to like someone. It is not the same feeling, and nor will it ever be. Spontaneous sleep over, night before an 8am final. Things are different, this time no sleep over, still 8am final. Hours from now, rummaging through walmart. Who was I? I didnt do this. I was never this carefree. 2am still not asleep, and didnt open a book one last time. Instead, I was filled with deep conversation untill 5 am. Comfort was found in something completely new. What 8am final? Didn't care, I knew things were different. Not this year. 11:30, no talks, no stars, no randomness. Just here. 

Thing is, here and now, I realize that wasn't what I wanted it to be. He may have been what I wanted, everything I needed. But not now. Infatuation turned to more, but only one sided. I couldnt be what he wanted. And now, I am glad I wasn't. Seeing how things are now between us, that first night under the stars, will never happen again, or at least not to the same degree. Because next time, it will be guarded. No window back, just looking through the glass because that layer isnt ready to come off yet.

Last year this time I was happy.
Right now I am happy, that I am not in that same place as I was last year.

This is final. This is closure. 

Whether I want it to be or not.

I'm done.

"event","is this world such an evil place. how can there be so much madness, coupled with so little peace. why cant we all get along. why cant we all tell each other exactly what we feel. why cant we admit when we have a problem and get help. if everyone had these abilities to fully accept love and never hate, we would be a totally different world, one without madness and hurt and death. we wouldnt have to greive over tradgedy, yet we could cry over the happy times in life because there would be no crime and hate. my heart goes out to everyone at virginia tech and everyone all over who is experiencing ard times in their lives. i know its not easy and it hasnt been here either. but we can get through it together and we will be stronger because of it. it may not seem it now, but good will prevail over evil, and eventually there will be more joy than hate in the world. i just hope it happens sooner than later."

"event","Today has been absolutely miserable outside. It is effin freezing, with 10000000miles an hour winds and RAIN on top of that all! SHeesh...

But, i must say this weekend was freaking fantastic. Friday night went to a show in GSO where Jay met up with me and we had good hangs through Saturday! The show was awesome, Sunset Greets the Moon is killer live and Yearling as always is phenominal! Akward moments later on in the night, but whatever cant do anything about them now. I just dont like to be reminded that i dont have anyone in my life. Leave it at that.

Saturday woke up early to go shopping with Jay. I bought a really cute funky shirt with matching earings! So cute. Then later I had to pick up Brandon Heath from the airport so he could perform at Elonthon. Seriously, one of the nicest guys to ever work with. Funny, pretty cute, awesome voice, i mean come on! Then I actually stayed at Elonthon for 6 hours standing. I have no idea how people do it for the whole 24 but they are champs!

Today went to C-Barrell with Amelia. She had never been before, so i thought i would open her eyes. Then she had also never seen the notebook, so i opened her eyes to that movie as well! I love showing people the wonders of the world.

Well i am going to go finish my laundry, then go to bed... hope everyone has a wonderful night!

Lately things have been looking up. I dont know if it is just because i am telling myself to be in a better mood or what but things are getting better. 

So tonight Dan Ahdoot came to campus and if you dont know who he is well you should. Funny comedian who is pretty much the nicest guy ever and adorable and will buy you drinks and is all around lovely. Go love him to.

Jacks Mannequin is a week away and i am kind of excited. Havnt seen John in forever, and am wondering how this is going to go. 

Going to a  show at greene street tomorrow where i will be greated by one of the besties and will have a lovely weekend.

"event","It has been a while since i have written in this thing. While i have had stuff to update on, I dont ever find the time to update. So before I go to bed, here is some lovin' for you all.
These past weeks have been hectic to say the least. Lets go back to before NACA, well starting with NACA. Tennesse was pretty cool even though we stayed in the Vattican all 4 days. I swear i did not breath real oxygen for 4 days. The Opry hotel is effin huge! Seriously, i was finally getting my bearings by day 3. Deff. found myself a hmmm for the weekend, but nothing more than some eye fucking and smiles. 

Moving on to the following weekend. Can we say much needed and awesome times. First off, the besties joined me in a weekend of loveliness of 3 shows in 3 days. What? yeah thats right music up the wazooo. Friday night in GSO was nice and quaint. Hangage with reverie and yearling dudes after was pretty tight. Saturday night was a doozie. Planning for this show in less than a week, if you dont know, is kind of a doozie. But, the night went off perfectly. Everything went smoothly and every band was phenominal. Sunday, we ended the weekend with a little cute and atl. Let me say how good it is to see those boys grow from a crowd of 10 people to a sold out show. A little part of me was sad, but ehh, ill get over it.

However, after all this amazingness this past week with school has been hell. From stupid ass grades to drama and bull shit, this week was not needed what so ever. And you know what? I should have known it was coming due to the fact that i had a weird ass dream sunday night that foreshadowed all of this shit. Involving someone i still think about often, to open fields with the sense of oncoming tornados, to running in huge mansion houses with a willy wonkaesque feel to them, running down endless flights of stairs and escalators, only to end up in a library where i see it is snowing outside. All ending with teal ice cream. Seriously, WTF? I have no idea, but apparently that was all foreshadowing shit. Anyhoos...

One thing that was the best night of my life was seeing The Early November finally headline their own tour. And yes, I got to hear my 2 favorite songs, All we ever needed and Sunday Drive. Can i say i was almost brought to tears. I cant even describe how happy i was to be at the show. No one knows just how much these kids have impacted my life and how i will be forever greatful. P.S.- i felt like a kid again getting my setlist for the night ;) Ohh and Ace is wonderful. Enough said.

So now all i am gearing up for is the last week of classes before spring break. I ahte class so im sure it will drag out as long as humanly possible. But i am looking forward to finally getting a Mac over spring break, good richmond shows, hangage with the besties, and maxin and relaxin. Bummer that prior plans were stomped, but whatevs.

Ohh and i found a roomate for next year, 2 bedroom appt. Hella nice. Come Visit!

Ok, so now that i think i have completely bored you to death with this massively long update, i will go try and sleep now. Go listen to Yearling, Mercy Mercedes, or Billie Holiday. They are current obsessions!

"event","I can never make everyone happy. I hate it. I come home for a few days, and no matter what, i end up screwing some or all aspects of my life up. Lets list it shall we:
1. I am a horrible friend. I did not get to make it down to Norfolk to see Niki or Ty before Ty leaves for 3 months to be in New Zeland. I know it was somewhat out of my control seeing as i did not have a car to my access to make it down there, but still. Bad friend.
2. I am a horrible grandaughter. I have been home since Wednesday and have yet to make it over to my g-ma's to even spend 5 minutes with her. Enough said there, hopefully tomorrow i will fix this a little bit. 
3. I am a horrible daughter. Have not spent more than like 30 minutes with my mom this whole break. I suck even more.
4. I am a horrible student. Spring semester starts up Tuesday and i have yet to buy my books. I got another B- in my winter term class. I did not get all of my SNL dates prepared over winter term. I could care less about it all. Whatev's

What i did accomplish over break:
1. Got to be a decent sister, making it to all of my brother's bball games and hangin with him at chili's.
2. Managed, somehow, to screw over my new outlook on the whole not caring whether or not i have a dude in my life. I did this by doing exactly what i said i was going to do and didnt worry for once about who i was with or liked or blah blah blah, not caring and just having fun, but somehow i dont have anything anymore. Who the fuck knows.
3. Pissy ass drunk texting leads to another flaw in my character.
4. Bad influence by letting a friend get their tounge pierced, and supplied them with a place to go. Their choice, but i still feel responsible. Her parents may get a little mad.
5. Also, got a bad cold.
6. Watched the Winter X-Games every night. One highlight of my weekend.
7. Not much

I hate this feeling right now of being completely worthless. Whatever. Off to finish out my weekend with the last night of Winter X.

Peace Out.

p.s.- may get a new car. cross your fingers."

Dont get me wrong, i love the money, i hate the time consuming aspect of it. Rawr, anyhoos. Winter Term is almost over, thank god! Its just been weird to say the least.

Get to go home Weds. Looking forward to some good hangs, especially Chili's date with Jay! YES! Bummed no shows are taking place, seeing as that is the only reason i ever go home. WHatevs, im sure ill find something to occupy my time.

Probably going to see Niki and Ty in Norfolk friday night/ saturday. Plans are still in the works...

Blah blah blah im just talking cause i have nothing else to do. Nothing exciting has been going on. No major updates. My life is a bore right now.

"event","Recently I have realized that I can't control a lot of things, and that I am ok with that, and have to learn to get over it. I can't control the fact that a dude dropped me for another girl. I can however rise above it, still be cool with it and MOVE ON. That is what I am doing. I can't control that some people lead you on with words, but don't follow through with actions. I can however spit the same words back stronger and know that when I see them in person I WILL follow through whether they like it or not. This is what I will do. I can't control the fact that I am realizing what I miss most about him isn't him entirely, but the thought of sleeping next to someone and it being the most amazing feeling in the world to know that when you wake up they are still going to be right by your side. I can however, have HOPE that the next person will only stick around for the long run. Nights like this, is what makes me miss that feeling the most. I want comfort in my life. I want to know that someone will be there for me every morning, through good and bad. I want someone to hold me, and let me sleep in their arms the entire night. That's all. Hopefully, something like this will come around soon, and this empty feeling will subside. Until then, I can't control much of anything."

"event","So it is Thursday night and i am sitting at work doing nothing for the next hour and 15 minutes. I could probably do some homework, but ill get to that in a little bit. So it has been a little while since i have updated to lets recap:

Christmas: I love morning brunch with my moms side of the family. Its pretty much what i look forward to every year. Then went to the pops house and had a nice afternoon. Bro got sick and passed it on, so i was feeling like crap for a couple of days. That wasnt cool.

New Years: Went over a lot better than last with the whole no hangover this year. Yay! i was proud of myself :) However i did not get a kiss at midnight but whatevs its all good.

Back to school: Came way to effin early. Got to see Niki before i came back down to Elon which was awesome. I miss my Mafia Spice. Good hangs with her and Ty then school happened again. Winter Term just is weird. 15 days of class, by the time you get used to it, its over already. and i relaized how much i love my sleep and dont like 8 a.m.'s Grrr

Other than that things have been aight. Kinda a rough night last night. Saw the old dude, and he was well pretty much a douche the whole night. Yeah thanks for standing next to me the whole night making out with your new girl, and not even acknowledging im there. Cool, you're a trooper! After apparently being cool, and friendly with me, yeah whatevs. im over it and not caring anymore.

Going home this weekend to see my boys in Love and Reverie. Alley Katz show, thats whats up. Prolly going to Nacho Mamma's after with de jay and katie, pretty much how we roll in RIC. Then if i get lucky a movie? I guess we will see. Ohh and i am stoked cause i get to buy some new jeans, since i pretty much destroyed 2 pairs over xmas break. Yay!

So this just killed 10 mins at work wohoo!!!

Im out,
Peace

"event","So, I was tagged by Ashley a little bit ago about 20 things that no one knows about you. I know it has been a while but finally here are some things that might surprise you:

1. There are so many things I want to accomplish every day that I get overwhelmed and don't end up doing half of them most of the time.

2. I am a messy person and will always be one. Not a gross messy, just clutter messy.

3. If I had a choice, I don't think I would be in school right now.

4. There are points every few months where I have bad panic attacks, and I can't do anything about them.

5. I am the worst at keeping in touch with people close and far away. I am horrible at returning phone calls, I never write letters, and emails are the worst of them all.

6. I sleep with a stuffed unicorn named Valentine every night.

7. I still dont honestly know what I want to do with my life, and when people ask, usually every month, it is different.

8. I joke about how much I hate geese, but in reality they really do scare the living shit out of me.

9. I try to be a good friend to many people but know I come up short or fail miserably half the time.

10. I take my family for granted, and I want so badly everyday to change that because they mean the world to me.

11. I LOVE the Disney Channel and watch at least one show every day.

12. I wonder every day if I will ever find love. 

13. Surfing has been something I have been obsessed with learning and reading about for years now, but when it comes to learning how, the ocean coming up past my waist strikes a fear in me I have yet to get over.

14. I want to have a vinyl record collection but dont know where to begin. I love the vintage feel.

15. I secretly want to live my life through movies because they are one of my only escapes from reality.

16. I resent high school and still get frustrated thinking about the time I wasted on friendships and being someone I really wasnt happy with. 

17. My mom is my hero even though we fight on a consistent basis every time I come home.

18. I want to learn photography so I can open a black and white gallery some day.

19. I am addicted to chap-stick.

20. I am adamantly against smoking and have always told people not to smoke. But, I secretly want to try it and am usually attracted to guys who do smoke."

Tacky Sweater party: can i say one hell of a night! Awesomeness all around from jello, to peppermint, to bp, to photo shoots, and some really awesome people. Haha and I filled a lil fix of the attention i've been wanting lately :)Anyhoos... all around good times till the morning after and clean up! Whew, that was a doozie!

Since then i have done nothing but shop for gifts, and feel as if i have yet to make a dent in them yet! Seriously how hard can it be right? Wrong, its brutal!

I leave thursday for my friend Jordans wedding back down in ELON! Yay, i am so excited because i get to dress up in a cute new dress i just got a Dillards and a seriously hot pair of black B.C.B.G. pumps! YAY!!! Not to mention i get to see everyone i havnt seen in forever, good hangs to come, with a little bacherlorette flair in the mix as well.

"event","So i achieved it! This post is going to be nothing but amazing and fun times i have had over the past 4 days. Lets recap:

Thursday: I drove home to Richmond to work y101's snowball 2006. This consisted of me running around al night catering to bands. The band lineup for the night included Sparta, Say Anything, and My Chemical Romance. First off, started working a meet and greet with the boys of Say Anything. Ohh my gosh do i love a guy in tight skinny jeans holy cow, and to be surrounded by 5 of them. Found out later that one of the only guys i talked to was in fact Parker, from the formerly amazing group Jamison Parker. Seriously that band has helped me through some rough times and finding out after the fact that it was him, Ahhh amazing. They were all really cool. Next on the nights agenda was working the My Chemical Romance meet and greet. Lets just say Gerard is my HMMMM!!! Totally had a moment with him :)Then came the show! All the bands were pretty amazing. Standing in the front to be paparazzi for the night was pretty sweet, and good times afterwards hanging with Bevin and Ashley, who drove up for the show, was deff a great topper to an amazing night. This was only a taste of the amazing weekend to ensue...

Friday: Start off the day by hanging out with Jessica Lee and getting on her show in the afternoon. From there i went to get my love, TARO BUBBLE TEA. Got to hang with Dash, De, and Nat. before heading off to Race the Sun's final show EVER! Not gonna lie it was kinda sad. A band called Conditions opened the night which made me happy because it is a cobination of all previous richmond bands who split coming together to play an awesome set. PBR made me smile like Woah. My boys in the Half J's played next and simply rocked the mic! Yours Truly made my night period if nothing else. All TIme Low stepped up next and staright up gangsta rocked out from intro to ending! They never cease to amaze me. Finally Race the Sun played. I have never seen Alley Katz so incredibly packed and energetic as it was that night. From all the original members reuniting for a song on stage to Daniel climbing to the second floor and jumping into the crowd only to be causght and shoved back on stage. I am going to miss those boys, richmond music scene was deff. changed by this band, and whether anybody wants to admit that or not, without them it wouldnt be the same. After the show, hooked up with Franklin and the rest of the half j's, and rolled downtown with a huge posse of people into the after party. Not gonna lie, it was a bit sketchy but good hangs with Daniel and some other kids i have not seen in a while went down and it was fabulous.

Saturday: Drove back to Elon to put on our last SNL of the semester. I wasnt too stoked going into the night but Battle of the Bands turned out AMAZING!!! So excited. Afterwards went to Keough's Christmas party, where many of the events of that night actually had to be told to me the following morning. I remember alot of beverages being consumed. Apparently i like to throw bread, dump water in peoples laps, quote Elf to Ashley, and have other random people try to pay ,my friends to punch me in the face for $10.00. Yeah, fun night!

So this was my weekend. I couldnt have asked for a more amazing one. I have yet to do any of my work and it is now 12a.m. Monday morning. I have a 5-7 page paper due tuesday i have yet to start, and a presentation as well. But the thing is i dont care. I love the fact i had an amazing weekend, good times with friends is all i really care about. I have finals coming up as well. Ok enough of me talking for the night. Sorry it was such a long post!

I want to dance dance until the sun rises in abandoned parking lots with open skies. We can dress up oh so elegant, freeing ourselves from the city life.

"event","Story:
One day he asked her, ""Have you ever been in love?""
She responded, ""What do you mean by love?""
He said, ""I mean, have you ever been to the point where you cant think because everything reminds you of that one person. Where from the moment you wake up, to dreaming at night, they never leave your head. Where anything in the world seems possible because they are by your side. You would do anything in your powers to keep them from shedding one tear, and if they did cry, you would be the shoulder for them to cry on. Where they are your rock as you are theirs. Where the world lyes in their eyes and arms...""
She said, ""I had that feeling once, but i wouldnt call it love.""
He said, ""Why?""
Her, ""Because the minute you think everything is going to be ok, it's not. The minute you feel you can do everything, they stop believing. That rock becomes nothing but a pebble that would get washed away with the tears you cry. Dreams become nightmares, and waking up is the last thing you want to do.""
Him, ""What happened?""
Her, ""Reality, that's what.""

Maybe if i sleep for a very long time things will be ok.

Ever feel like the world that you want to live is circling the life that you actually are living. And i dont mean the broad concepts of life, like career and stuff like that. But just everyday decisions that normally in your head go over so nicely but then when actually put to the test on paper, just some how dont seem to add up? yeah, feel like that a little bit lately. i can see certain situations in my life going one way, when i know as soon as i voice my thoughts are going to go right down the hole. i wish things played out like the movies, where everything works out perfectly in the end. the girls gets the boy, and they live happily ever after.

I swear, flu shots only make you sick, i think i have determined that and yes billy can make fun of me for that because he said so from the start, that thats all flu shots make you is sick. Anyhoos, this past weekend was fantastic. Friends from home came down and we brought Love and Reverie to Elon saturday night. Their new CD sounds phenominal!!! Freaking stoked i cannot wait!!! Sunday we went shopping and i bought 2 new shirts i am in love with and went to see Boys Like Girls, Valencia, and Spitalfield. Each time Valencia amazes me more and more. BLG were freaking awesome as well. 

Now onto my ranting part of this section. Ok scenario 1: Comments from said dude about how certain places are not the same with out me. First off, i thought this thing was over this summer when dude didnt want a relationship and was in one a week later. Have not talked to him since then and saw him once at a show where things were alright but no inclination that he wanted a friendship out of this. Called a couple of weeks ago randomly and then comments. When its supposed to be a joke, i would have assumed that communication would have occured between seeing dude and comments to make the atmosphere more light hearted. Nope, then when questioning, ohh its all supposed to be a joke. Hahahahaha... not funny. didnt get it but whatevs. Hopefully ill get over it soon enough. Scenario 2: Dude im interested in deff. have no fucking idea where that one is going. Bummer and a half. i suck at life.

So my shift is up in exactly one minute and girl is not here yet. Im stoked to go home and sleep. Have way to much to do this week, and only thing i want to do is go to Boba house with ryan on thursday and get some taro bubble tea! is that much to ask for. No i have to write a 30 page paper and crap out on seeing Brand New and Dashboard! FUCK!!! I just want bubble tea!

Ok Girl is officially late, im pissed, and sorry fot the long message this time!

so this weekend was lovelyish in a way. d and jay came down for the weekend and we had a blast at zombies. unicorns. sluts. and condiments saturday night. it was quite a fun time but some aspects i wish had gone better. today we went and saw man of the year which i highly recommend waiting and renting on DVD. just kinda an ehh movie. anyhoos, realized i have a paper due tomorrow that i have not started and will not due so until tomorrow. Oops. ohh well. 

im still confused as ever with a boy situation. deff wanted to say something last night but luckily kept my lil mouth shut seeing as that could make certain situations awkward as hell. Gah and thats the most annoying part. wow anyhoos, anyone with suggestions are more than welcome to give them!

Yes, this summer i have an internship at this station and so far it has been awesome. I mean come on, free shows, promotional experience, as well as production stuff! Everyone is hilarious and its been awesome. I am typing all of this because i am sitting in my bosses office listening to the competition trying to see what they are doing for their morning show. So i figured i would give you all an update. I have also now picked up a new job at this little pizza place near my house called Carmela's and i make the best tips for a small joint... Extra money in my pocket, heck yes! Nothing really new has been going on lately. Ohh, i did get to go see Brand New a couple of nights ago and it was freaking phenominal!!! One downer is that there was an awesome sweat shirt that i really wanted but was $5 short of so i figured i could buy it on line.... NO, its not on their online store so i am thinking i might try and stalk the rest of their tour just to get myself one of these lovely pieces of clothing. The boy department is still lacking, i seem to always pick the ones that let you down. I mean come on, is there any guy that will just come out and tell you what he is either thinking or feeling without sugar coating it/ beating around the bush/ or just filling your head with empty words, just to get ass? hmm i dont know but im starting to think no. For me, all it takes is a little phone call, i dont care what you say as long as its what you are thinking or feeling, if i have reason to be pissed i will be but for the majority of the time i dont care if you think your going to hurt my feelings i would just like to know. Ok, enough of that babling. everyone go sing in the rain today, because i hear there are going to be more downpours...

"event","Ok, so in my last post i mentioned that i was so stoked for this ohh so famous Taro bubble tea with black pearls. So the other day my mom and i were excited to get back into our routine of going to the Pearl Tea House at Stony Point to get this infamous tea. Ok so i pull up get out and go to get our beverages that i have been dying for for months now, and i walk up the pathway to only turn into a closed up shop! I look around and make sure that i am indeed standing infront of the correct spot, and to my disappointment the place that supplied me with many happy memories and drinks was gone forever! I am in a state of shock and all that i have left is the powder taro and black pealrs that were given to me for christmas, but its not the same having to make it myself, i mean no more cool color straws, no more amazingly nice people greeting me and making my drink without asking, no more raving about this place. It's all just a long lost memory!Pearl Tea House, i will never forget you and your amazing Taro bubble tea with black pearls!!!"

"event","haha it is sad that it took me like 4 times to remember my password to this thing. one because i have had to change it so many times i just couldnt think and two because i feel like i havnt updated in a very long time. well well where to start. it seems as though this week is going by incredibly slpw, and maybe its the fact that i cant wait for spring break and for tomorrow to be done and over with that i am feeling liek this. i have 2 big tests for that my professors decided to put in the same day, joy for me. i am feeling a bit overwhelmed with all of the studying that must occur and having this computer in front of me is not helping. Oh well! lol so lately i have been having a blast with school activities and other shows of the sort. i find that knowing when my next show is, pretty much gets me through the weeks. ohh so today on fuse i saw an old school taking back sunday video and realized that i am going to be seeing them soooo soon that i cant even express how stoked i am for the show. i was like blasting the cd in my room today after i heard it. ohh and random thought, i can not wait to get some BUBBLE TEA when i get home. holy crap has it been forever since i have had that stuff to drink. ohhh taro tea with black pearls here i come!!! ahh and the fact that i get to have a movie marathon with my mom, is going to be quite fantastic. Ohhhh and not to mention JUST SURRENDER!!!!! holy crap!!!! spring break is going to be the shit. it kinda stinks some key people arnt going to be around for the whole week but its cool, i know i get to see them for a bit. so what else is there to post on that is going through my life right now. hmm, i want a boyfriend, but thats always the same just more blunt in this posting. and yeah its GORGEOUS outside. holy crap 80's and sunny for the past like 3 days, now all we need is maintenence to turn off our heat in the dorm and everyone will be happy campers. Ohh and did i mention DUKE won the ACC tourny. yes indeed my DUKE team, the one that is going to go all the way to the finals, hopefully!!! well im sure this is enough for you right now, for some reason i still feel like i could ramble on forever but i figured after this long ass post everyone would just stop reading after like 5 lines, so if you have made it this far congrats! if not well then you wont care that im calling you all losers right now!!! :-) have a lovely day whenever and to whoever reads this thing!!!"

"event","It is getting harder and harder to hide it everyday, that this smile on the outside is nothing but empty and lonliness inside. im scared of becoming a failure, im scared of never being anything in life, im scared of letting everyone down. i dont know what i can do anymore and this smile is slowly fading. yes, i realize that i am being a hypocrite...""smile and things will look a little better,"" isn't holding up anymore. i feel like the more i tell myself that, the more i want it to go away.yes, i repeat myself in these things but its the only place i feel i can write, next to pen and paper. i sit and realize that im not perfect, im not pretty, im not anything, and sometimes i wish people wouldnt care so much. why? in the end i dont matter. the only thing i love feels like an impossible dream, that is slowly fading. where do i start? sometimes i wonder what it would be like not to wish on shooting stars or 11:11's, what would happen? hopefully i will snap out of it soon..."

"event","somehow i always seem to have the worst instincts...EVER!!! reasons like this is why i just stop trying. anyways, im stoked about tomorrow because i get to see my boys in june and hh! its going to be a wicked show and hopefully it will cheer me up a bit. as of right now nothing to interesting is going on in my life. i know i know it seems like nothing is ever happening in my life, well welcome to it. i pretty much wish i could live at a show my whole life. i think if i did, i wouldnt ever be sad. i could live through the music and not have any worries. so as of right now that is my wish! well, since nothing else to really say, peace out!"

"event","nothing has ever looked so blurry before. driving into morning nothing but the fog hugs my car as every line that passes is one more step away from where i want to be. where do i want to be? the stars guided my sky last night but your not a constilation anymore. finger to finger my eyes to yours, you are where i want to be. i hate talking. i hate breathing. sleep next to me tonight and make sure im safe. i could still be ruthless if you let me. please let me."

"event","So i have pretty much decided that Ace is my hero of all time because he is just that incredibly amazing. ICMAMLNB set was phenomenal tonight, but i guess that is just me being bias. Owen and B.C. Camplight were very good as well which surprised me because i had no idea what to expect. I think the world needs more people like Ace who just care about the music. Talking with him afterwards and listening to what he has to say about everything in the business to just playing was like heaven in that all he wants is people to hear the music and not have to put up with the bull shit that comes along with it. I must say he is the reason i love music so much today, for a simple conversation like that to just blow me away, is just unreal. Anyways enough about that... I am home for fake break while the entirety of Elon's girls are still on campus rushing. I must say i just never felt like it was something i felt i needed to do, so im just not. So i get the week off, Yay for me. I dont know what i am doing for the rest of the week but hopefully it includes one more show and lots of sleep!!! Well it is late, mmm not really, but i am tired and want to go to sleep so you know what, thats exactly what i am going to do...
Go listen to The Early November, I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business, and any other music you can find composed bye Ace Enders and you will be set for life! Smile"

"event","i dont know anymore, can i cry to you in the middle of the night and know that everything will still be safe in the morning. this feeling of emptiness and confusion fill this canvas with what has never been a pretty picture. nothing ever seems right anymore, and there is nothing i can do. who the fuck am i, who am i going to be. the road has answers i wish i could only obtain. but its a long and narrow journey i am told not to take. your arms are what i want to be in, and yet you are not real. all these pictures and frames in life hold no meaning, because how can they when i dont know what they are about. i see all these fake images around me that i want to be a part of to feel like myself, but there is no accepting positions for this failure tonight. so i go back to my room for one more night of tears, hoping that tomorrow brings a little less pain than yesterday...

"event","so i know it has been a month since i have updated this thing but who knows, im sure no one noticed because i dont think anyone really reads it. i went home for winter break and all was well, especially the 5 days before break 4 shows in like 5 days made my christmas come early. new obsessions are just surrender and farewell. learn them! i am so happy i got to see all of my bamf's and others at home, i have come to realize who really matters to me and who could care less. in a way its good because i now know who will always be there for me, im just mad it took me this long and wasted emotions to realize it. but none the less better late than never. its been weird lately, i havnt completely felt myself. something just feels like it is missing. probably the fact that i want some attention could be it. nothing much more to say, writting to come soon..."

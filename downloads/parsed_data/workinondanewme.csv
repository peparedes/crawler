"event","hmmm...where to start...i guess here. Im really sorry about the phone how i didnt talk. i am not feeling good at all, not just my physically but mentally too. my dad was putting me in a really bad mood and so was my nephew. i was hoping that you would be there for me on the phone, and actually it made me kinda sad when you hung up. i dont know who else will be there for me if you choose not to. well i guess i'll talk to you later."

"event","well i woke up and went to soccer which was pretty awesome. i love the game. then i went ot oak harbor to get my hair cut and the lady cut my hair way to short, which...hm....SUCKS! during this time i called you gini, like a few times cause i wanted to do something with you. finally we went to the park so i could be with you...YOU. i got really depressed when you kept on wanting to hang out with austin downtown, cause i just wanted to be with you, i guess thats why most of the rest of the day went bad. i havent seen you in 5 days...thats a long time and i really missed you, more then you probably think. i dunno im just being a panzy and a jerk, wanting you all to myself. which i know i cant have, its been proven. there i go again. the movie was fun, i always like movies with you, maybe its cause thats the only time when you dont really hold back from being close to me, and holding my hand. i wish all of life was a huge movie so you would do taht all the time. going to the beach might have been a mistake, i was having fun in the beggining...kinda hyper. too hyper, i got out of control and got annoying, i know it. i dont like having to be avoided, you know what thats like when i said that you are kinda scary...yeah i was just joking too but it hurts. i know that it hurt you that i was like that and im sorry im such a baby about those things...""the little things"". today showed me once again...with all the silences, me not making it fun...im trully not good enough for you. i was trying to trick myself into thinking that changing for the better would fix it, but i cant change, im being the best i can be...and its not good enough. It makes me really sad to say that, it hurts me so deep inside knowing that is the truth. i wish i could be better for you, i wish i could be easier to talk to, that i was more fun, haha even that i was taller. im sorry for all this gini, its just me being retarted and a baby. i'll talk to you tommorrow. i still do love you though gini, you mean the world to me, i know its oversaid and such but its true. goodnight.

"event","hmm day sucked...worked, which was ok then it started ot suck. I thought we were gonna rent the movie tonight gini...you said you would, but when i called your cell you didnt answer, then i called your house. You are with ashley, which dont get me wrong is perfectly fine, except for the fact that you said that you wouldnt be able to do anything if i was at home sad and miserable, well now i am...but that will change cause hickman is coming over. Im sorry if this makes you cry but its just how i feel right now, not in the best mood. tommorrow i'll be busy, saturday ill be busy, same with sunday, monday, and tuesday, so today was it gini...i dont know what to tell you. I'll talk to you later. so i say goodnight for the next half week, cause as it is right now i probably wont call you at night unless something happens to change my mood. bye.

"event","well gini, since you want to know how my day went....i'll tell you. It was bad, first off i had to teach little kids how to do the crawlstroke. Little kids cant do anything close to that because they have no coordination whatsoever. they were really getting on my and lillians nerves today cause they just dont listen. you turn your back for a second and they are gone, i wanna just go up and karate kick one of them in the head! argh! sorry, then i wanted to go swimming with you but noooo today i had to resertify for CPR, it took 4 hours! it was the dumbest thing in the world, another wasted day. the worst part was not talking to you the whole day. thats the first time that has happened in who knows how long, it was crazy i kept coming online hoping you would be there but you never were. tommorrow is the only day that we can hang out all day, cause thursday i work till 7:30 and then on friday im driving to burlington to go to the mall. im very disapointed, i'll leave with that i guess..."

"event","today was fun...i was really hesitant about going to your house though, whenever i talk to you when ash is with you, you always seem to be in a really good mood and i dont want ot spoil that or ashleys. but i did anyway cause i wanted to see you. the park was fun, i love it when you lay on me and just hte little things like that, it makes me feel that you want ot be close to me and taht you are getting more comfertable in public. it makes me smile ;). your house was fun too, twister was fun...even though YOU QUIT! that didnt make me happy, i was sad ;(. but oh well, the pants coming off thing was not fun...but sitting on you was! lol. i wont be able to go swimming tommorrow with you...im sorry i have to resurtify, or however you spell that for CPR. from 2-6! thats a long time! its soooo dumb. but its ok after tommorrow my parents leave...then i can do whatever i want!! and you can come over and sit with me on my roof! yay..! alright i love you lots! buhbye

"event","today i woke up at like 11 and took a shower, when i got out you called and asked if you wanted to come to lunch. my dad was laying sick on the couch so i asked him then picked up my room, cleaned my bathroom, and washed my clothes. then i went to the bank and withdrew some money from my checking account with the help of ariel. dont worry gini i like you better, lol.then i came to the park and saw you in your car, you looked so peaceful and for a moment i was trying to decide whether or not to keep on driving and let you stay peaceful, aparently i decided to stop and break your peace. the bratwurst was very hot cause i put too many jalapenos in it. but oh well it was still pretty tasty. goin down to the beach was fun till i had to go to work. that was gay, but oh well i got money out of it. lifeguarding was sooooo boring! but it was nice having you there. i couldnt help but smile everytime i saw you looking at me...i dont know why. i tried not to, but i couldnt help it. sorry i couldnt come over and hang out with you two but hey thats life. I just realized that i need to play bass again, i havent in a long time. oh well im done writing in this cause i feel like a little girl when i keep a ""journal"" but hey im still writing more then you have...get to it!! tell me how each day went.

"event","ahhh gini...thank you sooo much for telling me to come over today, it really helped. sorry i cant tell you why what happened happened, i dont really know how to explain it. i hope it helped cheer you up to.  I want you to be happy most of all, forget me. i love your family! they make life so much fun whenever i come over, they are crazy and i love it, i wish i was apart of your family. the thumb wars were fun and so was the arm wrestling, haha then the slap boxing. it was alright, you are getting better! we just need to work on the straight punches and speed now, and while i help you with that it will help me with my defensiveness. so we both get good from it. sitting outside is a new memory that i will never forget. that was the greatest feeling in the world, i felt so connected with you, i liked it better then anything we have ever done, i would trade that for anything else if we could do it even once a week. you make me truly happy gini, if it wasnt for you i dont know where i would be after last night.  I love you thiiiiiiiiiiiisssssss much, talk to you soon.

"event","i woke up at the normal time to go to swimming lessons this morning. I thought i would be able to change...i tried but i know i can't. I will always be me, the person that hurt you and as you said even ""scared"" you. i dont know what to do anymore. I still want ot be with you all the time, everything reminds me of you, even the little kids swimming around in the water. i dont know how you are handling this, if you are sad or depressed like me, but i dont want you to be. I want you to go on living your life, have fun, hang out with your friends...even though you probably already are...this is going to be a short summer so you need to make the most of it, do all that you can to be happy.  I want you to be happy so bad, i dont care about me. I love you gini...

"event","so my day started out pretty normal, went swimming lessons and taught screaming 7 year olds for 3 hours. then worked for another 7 and a half lifeguarding.  So i came home and found that my parents were gonna be gone till 11, and thats when they came home, so i called you...i knew what i wanted...it was wrong but the next thing i did was even worse, you already know though so i wont go into it.  Im sooo sorry about that. i need to change...i know it and so do you, even though you might not want to admit it.  while i was telling you that i started crying, something i havent done in a long time.  These were different tears though, i have never cried like this before. when i left the internet i went up on my roof with a blanket for a while and just stared at the picture of you, the homecoming one. i cried again...why? it was strange, i only cried when i thought of the happy times we had together...homecoming, tooshy, the PSSSH guy in the pokemon movie, haha here come the tears again. I am going to miss you soo much gini, i dont know how im gonna live without you being there.  I have lived so long with you just being a call away and now that you arent, i dont know who i can turn to, i have no one...im all alone and i did it to myself. I want to just go to sleep for days then wake up to your smiling face, but i know that cant happen, i wish it could. I remember all the songs i put on your cd's, they showed how much i really do care about you, i want you to know that...i always will care about you, forever and ever.  I love you more then words can express and thats why this is so hard, thats why these tears are so much different then any other time i have shed them, ha well there they go again. fight for me gini, i want you to, i need you to, e-mail me, call me, just stop by and see me.  I'll see you around.

"event","its been long as hell since ive had the motivation to update this thing, and here i find myself, still not motivated, but desperate to say something to someone...hell, maybe just to see these words infront of me and know theyre real...maybe i can see something different if i hold my despair to a light.  for those who dont know, or who can see this, or both, my life is shit.  i quit one good job for another, and got fired from it, then everything spiraled down from there, leaving me making $40 a week, still in debt, carless, nearly homeless, scraping to eat, and trying to find a solution before time runs out and im screwed out of a place to sleep again.  im at my wits end.  nicole has decided that she doesnt love me at all anymore, and now i find out shes talking to a guy from starbucks, who she was talking to before she said these things to me, and now, all the sudden, shes interested.  so my strength, and my support, the one thing i always counted on being there for me, was ripped out from under me, and now im falling.  hard and fast.  i dont know where ill stop either...im struggling desperately for control, but cant find it without her...the only goal that i really had in life seems to be so far out of reach right now, and fading by the second. everything i say just gets shuffeled off into some folder in her mind...its like every word out of my mouth is prejudged, paraphrased, and shut out as annoying. im ready to die.  i cant wake up in the morning, i cant find a job, i cant find rides, and my friends dont seem to want to be around me anymore.  hell, i dont blame anyone, i dont want to be around me....all i can think of is how things could have been different, and how things could have never ended up here in the first place.  completely stuck dwelling on the past, unable to see beyond it.  for once in my life, im out of solutions.  i dont know how to fix this.  i want to feel anything but loss and frustration.  i want my heart to stop breaking and move on, or not... i want her back.  i dont.  i dont want to be lied to anymore, but i know it wont stop....i need to fix myself, and to do that, i need to break this cycle, but without my greatest support, my love, i dont know how.  im struggling, and screaming, and crying out.  she wont hear it..i feel too disconnected from everyone else to even ask..i know ive alienated most of them myself, and i cant think of anymore ways to fix them than i can to fix myself.  i need work, and money.  i need support and advice, and love....someone somewhere needs to snap me out of this, because i cant do it on my own, and the only things i can think of to end it are self-destructing...sad as it is.  i cant bring myself to the rage of indignation to move on and say fuck it.  i love her too much.  i just want to waste away, do nothing, and cry myself to an early grave.  anything anyone can say, or do, ill appreciate it, even if it doesnt seem like it at the moment...im drowning in myself, and dont want to stop"

"event","well, i managed to survive a terrible car accident.  the accident would be bad news if it werent for the new perspective that i have.  and things outside of that look up as well.  (sorry, not detailing the crash again, not in print, at least)  two jobs now.  technically.  im starting one tomorrow, the PC richards deal.  the other, im just not getting hours at because its the slow season, and in the music industry, youve definitely got to minimize costs to make a cent.  regardless, its two jobs, and theyll both pay relatively well.  should be a decent start.  
also, nicole got a car the other day, so now were fairly set for transportation.  especially after she gets her new drivers license.  and i make sure that mine doesnt get suspended...but thats another story.  things however, remain on the rise.  slowly, but surely, and i like that....because i feel that were less likely to fall hard if we build slow....or something like that."

"event","what exactly its the season for has me a little perplexed at the moment though.  is it christmas, chaunnakah, kwanza, ramadan, or what?  what about the rising pagan population of the united states.  is it yule season for us?  hard to tell anymore.  maybe its the season for giving.  or for taking...taking parking places, cut throat holiday shopping, screwing your fellow man on a deal or a sale just so that youre the most givingest person on the christmas card list?  heres an idea for the american public.  40 million americans (or something like that, i cant remember exactly the number
) are suffering from what scientists call, ""less than nominal food security"".  last year that meant hunger.  whatever it is this year, its bad, isnt it?  there are homeless people in the streets, myself being one of them.  people there not because of lazyness or anything like that, but because theyve lost everything.  there are people with less and people with nothing, and people with less than nothing.  this holiday time of cheer is the number one season for suicide.  what the hell is happening here?  did we lose something in the translation?(cant be worse than mis-translating ""virgin"" in the dead sea scrolls, can it?)

i think it is.  i think its terrible.  i think ill be one of perhaps thousands of voices trying to compell acts of kindness out of his fellow man doruing this season.  im one of the cold, i sure know that.  but mostly, what i think, is that for once, dont read something you see that compells you, go out, drop a canned good off at some guy with a bell at the local supermarket, and forget that others are starved, and cold, and sick and dying here, and around the world.  i think this should be a year where everyone makes an effort to try and remember, at least once per day, to do something to help out someone in a terrible situation.  someone starved, someone looking for work, someone scared and alone, someone whos hurt.  and i think that this should be a year round thing.  let that be the season....im dont ranting

Dear Mr. Bush:

Any idea where all our helicopters are? It's Day 5 of Hurricane Katrina and thousands remain stranded in New Orleans and need to be airlifted. Where on earth could you have misplaced all our military choppers? Do you need help finding them? I once lost my car in a Sears parking lot. Man, was that a drag.

Also, any idea where all our national guard soldiers are? We could
really use them right now for the type of thing they signed up to do
like helping with national disasters. How come they weren't there to
begin with?

Last Thursday I was in south Florida and sat outside while the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed over my head. It was only a Category 1 then but it was pretty nasty. Eleven people died and, as of today, there were still homes without power. That night the weatherman said this storm was on its way to New Orleans. That was Thursday! Did anybody tell you? I know you didn't want to interrupt your vacation and I know how you don't like to get bad news. Plus, you had fundraisers to go to and mothers of dead soldiers to ignore and smear. You sure showed her!

I especially like how, the day after the hurricane, instead of flying
to Louisiana, you flew to San Diego to party with your business peeps. Don't let people criticize you for this -- after all, the hurricane was over and what the heck could you do, put your finger in the dike?

And don't listen to those who, in the coming days, will reveal how you specifically reduced the Army Corps of Engineers' budget for New Orleans this summer for the third year in a row. You just tell them that even if you hadn't cut the money to fix those levees, there weren't going to be any Army engineers to fix them anyway because you had a much more important construction job for them -- BUILDING DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ!

On Day 3, when you finally left your vacation home, I have to say I was moved by how you had your Air Force One pilot descend from the clouds as you flew over New Orleans so you could catch a quick look of the disaster. Hey, I know you couldn't stop and grab a bullhorn and stand on some rubble and act like a commander in chief. Been there done that.

There will be those who will try to politicize this tragedy and try to
use it against you. Just have your people keep pointing that out.
Respond to nothing. Even those pesky scientists who predicted this
would happen because the water in the Gulf of Mexico is getting hotter and hotter making a storm like this inevitable. Ignore them and all their global warming Chicken Littles. There is nothing unusual about a hurricane that was so wide it would be like having one F-4 tornado that stretched from New York to Cleveland.

No, Mr. Bush, you just stay the course. It's not your fault that 30
percent of New Orleans lives in poverty or that tens of thousands had no transportation to get out of town. C'mon, they're black! I mean, it's not like this happened to Kennebunkport. Can you imagine leaving white people on their roofs for five days? Don't make me laugh! Race has nothing -- NOTHING -- to do with this!

You hang in there, Mr. Bush. Just try to find a few of our Army
helicopters and send them there. Pretend the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast are near Tikrit.

Yours,

Michael Moore
MMFlint@aol.com

P.S. That annoying mother, Cindy Sheehan, is no longer at your ranch. She and dozens of other relatives of the Iraqi War dead are now driving across the country, stopping in many cities along the way. Maybe you can catch up with them before they get to DC on September 21st"

"event","The Hollow Men 
by Thomas Stearns Eliot 

I 

We are the hollow men 
We are the stuffed men 
Leaning together 
Headpieces filled with straw. Alas! 
Our dried voices, when 
We whisper together 
Are quiet and meaningless 
As wind in dry grass 
Or rat's feet over broken glass 
In our dry cellar. 

Shape without form, shade without color, 
Paralyzed force, gesture without motion; 

Those who have crossed 
With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom 
Remember us - if at all - not as lost 
Violent souls, but only 
As the hollow men 
The stuffed men. 


II 

Eyes I dare not meet in dreams 
In death's dream kingdom 
These do not appear: 
There, the eyes are 
Sunlight on a broken column 
There, is a tree swinging 
And voices are 
In the wind's singing 
More distant and more solemn 
Than a fading star. 

Let me be no nearer 
In death's dream kingdom 
Let me also wear 
Such deliberate disguises 
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves 
In a field 
Behaving as the wind behaves 
No nearer- 

Not that final meeting 
In the twilight kingdom. 


III 

This is the dead land 
This is the cactus land 
Here the stone images 
Are raised, here they receive 
The supplication of a dead man's hand 
Under the twinkle of a fading star. 

Is it like this 
In death's other kingdom 
Waking alone 
At the hour when we are 
Trembling with tenderness 
Lips that would kiss 
Form prayers to broken stone. 


IV 

The eyes are not here 
There are no eyes here 
In this valley of dying stars 
In this hollow valley 
This broken jaw of our lost kingdom. 
In the last of meeting places 
We grope together 
And avoid speech 
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river 

Sightless, unless 
The eyes reappear 
As the perpetual star 
Multifoliate rose 
Of death's twilight kingdom 
The hope only 
Of empty men. 


V 

Here we go round the prickly pear 
Prickly pear prickly pear 
Here we go round the prickly pear 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
Between the idea 
And the reality 
Between the motion 
And the act 
Falls the Shadow 

For thine is the Kingdom 

Between the conception 
And the creation 
Between the emotion 
And the response 
Falls the Shadow 
Life is very long 

Between the desire 
And the spasm 
Between the potency 
And the existence 
Between the essence 
And the descent 
Falls the Shadow 
For Thine is the Kingdom 
For Thine is 
Life is 
For Thine is the 

This is the way the world ends 
This is the way the world ends 
This is the way the world ends 
Not with a bang but with a whimper."

The staff x-rayed his chest, and theres a dark spot in one of his lungs...possibly hes lucky, and its only pneumonia.  perhaps hes not and its something worse...he does smoke multiple packs a day.  then she told me rather calmly that shed had a minor siexure in applebees, and had lost five hours of the day because of it, but apparently, she had been concious for most of them.  said she loved me and that was all, goodbye.  bit of shock, is all i can imagine to describe my state of mind earlier....im better now tho...ive called home, and checked with everyone, andtheyre doing ok, and theyll keep me updated, so i guess all i can do is pray for the best...."

"event","Two couples were playing poker one evening.
John accidentally dropped some cards on the floor.
When he bent down under the table to pick them up,
he noticed Bill's wife, Sue wasn't wearing any underwear
under her dress!
 
Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again,
hit his head on the table and emerged red-faced.

Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments.
Bill's wife followed and asked,
 
""Did you see anything that you liked under there?""
 
Surprised by her boldness, John courageously admitted that,
well indeed he did.
 
She said, ""Well, you can have it, but it will cost you $500.""

After taking a minute or two to assess the financial,
and moral costs of this offer..
 
John confirms that he is interested.
 
She tells him that since her husband Bill works Friday
afternoons and John doesn't, John should be at her house
around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon.

When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house
at 2 p.m. sharp and after paying Sue the agreed sum of $500
they went to the bedroom and closed their transaction,
as agreed. John quickly dressed and left.

As usual, Bill came home from work at 6 p.m. and upon entering
the house, asked his wife abruptly,
 
""Did John come by the house this afternoon?""

With a lump in her throat Sue answered ""Why yes, he did stop by
for a few minutes this afternoon.""
 
Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband
curtly asked,
""And did he give you $500?""
 
In terror she assumed somehow he had found out
and after mustering her best poker face, replied,
 
""Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500.""

With a satisfied look on his face, Bill surprised his wife by saying,
 
""Good, I was hoping he did. John came by the office this morning
and borrowed $500 from me. He promised me he'd stop by our house
this afternoon on his way home and pay me back.""

Now THAT, my friends, is a poker player!"

"event","ok, so please allow me to clarify something before anyone reads any further.  i am a proud american.  i love my country, most especially because it allows me to say things like what im about to post.  im a proud and patriotic american,  and ive served my country to prove it.  there are things wrong with the system, and the establishment, and only through making it known can we hope to change it.  
     recently, i came across a dvd...the bonus dvd from rock against bush vol. 2, to be exact.  it was a sort of revelation for me...ive felt this way for a while, but the dvd was the final push for me...now is time for me to say something, and to make sure that its heard.  its too late for us to stop the bush dynasty, but we can be aware, and stop it from happening again!

     firstly, this:
20 more reasons to hate dubya

1. he refused to buy adequate body armor for our troops in iraq.   a study done by a defense consultant reveals that approximately 25% of casualties could have been prevented with better armor.

2.  responsible for the largest US trade deficit EVER; $43.1 billion

3.  bush jr. gave his campaign contributors and strongest supporters $8 billion in contracts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan.  corporations like Halliburton, Bechtel, Kellog, Brown & Root, etc.  numerous scandals have been uncovered regarding these ""friendly"" contractors who are ripping off US taxpayers by overcharging for their services.

4.  bush campaign shirts were made in burma under sweatshop conditions.  interestingly enough, in 2003 bush jr. signed legislation banning products from burma effective 11/01/03.

5. he approved the sale of $20 million worth of shackles, electro-shock technology, and other torture devices to countries that have been condemned for torture.

6. college tuition has increased 28% during the bush administration.

7. the bush jr. administration was told by over 60 influential scientists, including 20 nobel prize winners, that they are ""deliberately and systematically distorting scientific facts-in the service of policy goals on the environment, health, biomedical research, and nuclear weaponry, both at home and abroad.""

8.  he proposed a budget that would slash 40% of funding for after-school programs.  no child left behind?  this decrease would cut off 475,000 children.

9.  bush jr. authorized the use of cluster bombs and ""daisy cutters""  (the worlds most powerful non-nuclear bomb)  in populated areas of iraq.  these have contributed to the deaths of over 10,000 innocent civilians, more than three times the number of casualties suffered in the 9-11 attacks.  NOTE: no iraqis were involved in 9-11

10. richard clarke (chief anti-terrorism advisor) and paul o'neill (US treasury secretary)  both testified that bush jr. was intent on invading iraq within the first few days of his presidency.  clarke claims that bush ignored his warnings about an imminent  al-qaeda attack.  on september 12, bush instructed his staff to find a connection between iraq and al-qaeda, and despite no connection ever being discovered (and against the CIAs recommendation), he still chose to invade iraq.  NOTE: this has been confirmed by the 9-11 commission.

11.  although he claims that fighting terrorism is still his main priority, bush jr. cut the FBIs requested counterterrorism budget by two thirds.

12. bush jr. has made it clear that in this term, he plans to appoint supreme court justices who are against womens right to chose, and he would effectively outlaw abortion on a national level.

13.  bush jr. still has yet to attend a soldiers funeral, and continues to steer the american public away from knowing about the casualties.  he has done even less to acknowledge the over 18'000 troops that have been wounded in iraq and afghanistan.

14.  his administration illegally produced pro-bush ""news"" spots for the dept. of health and human services.  they went so far as to include phoney journalists who praised dubya's controversial medicare bill and they added a fake crowd to cheer the whole thing on.

15.  in an effort to give the appearance that bush jr. was creating more jobs, his administration tried to re-classify fast food jobs as manufacturing jobs.  these minimum wage jobs are nothing like real manufacturing jobs that provide benefits, and pay $15/hr.

16.  his administration proposed the highest penalties in the world for indecency violations on our public airwaves.  up to $500,000 for saying something the FCC deems offensive

17.  he is a religious fanatic who believes in the apocalypse and that ONLY evangelical christians are eligible for the afterlife.  catholics, muslims, jews, hindus, buddhists, and everyone that isnt in bushs flock are all doomed to hell.  to thee the full extent of his extremist views, watch the PBS documentary <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus"">""the Jesus Factor""</a>

18. the treasury department under bush jr. assigned five times as many agents to investigate cuban embargo violations as they did to track the financial resources of osama bin laden and saddam hussein.

19.  right before christmas bush jr cut overtime pay for over 644,000 employees who work over 40 hours a week.

20.  against colin powells advice, bush jr. chose not to recognize afghanistans statehood, therefor making its peoples not protected by international law, and vulnerable to human rights abuses and torture.  up until that decision by bush jr., the US military could boast a proud history of upholding the humane laws of the geneva convention.


     so thats enough reasons to be disgusted as far as im concerned...theres far far more...

Voices From Around The World:

""the bush people have no right to speak for my father.  yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the '80's, but the overall thrust of this administration is not my fathers-these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive, and just plain corrupt.  i dont trust these people.""
     -ronald regan jr.

""of course i feel a certain discomfort that we were misled about weapons of mass destruction.""
     -aleksander kwasniewski, president of poland

""why does the united states behave so arrogantly?  they just want the oil""
     -nelson mandella, former president of south africa

""iraq definitely does not have nuclear weapons, nor any long-range carrier systems which could take what it does not have to their targets.  we can disarm iraq without war.""
     -gerhard schroeder, chancellor of germany

""if we change every government we dont like in the world, where do we start?  who is next?""
     -jean chretien, prime minister of canada

""the president is like a blind man in a room full of deaf people""
     -paul o'neill, bush jr.'s former US treasury secretary

""america forsees a loss of 15,000 american soldiers.  whoever is preparing a war has to take into account the cost that any strike will provoke on the enemies, in the area, on friends, and on its own side.  we already have a war, why dont you stop that one instead of starting another one?
     -archbishop renato martino, vatican official

""moron.""  - francoise ducros, top aide to canadas prime minister

""governments should be changed only by the decisions of the people and no outside power can do this.""
     -atal bihari vajpayee, prime minister of india

""military action against iraq is a major political mistake.  we are extremely concerned at the threat to the existing international security system.""
     -vladmir putin, president of russia

""our allegiance will be for peace,  against war, no more deaths for oil, and for a dialogue between the government of spain, and the new <u>Kerry</u> administration.""
     -jose luis rodriguez, prime minister of spain

     ok.  thats all for straight up anti-bush ranting.  now we come down to the real reason this is being posted. theres serious corruption in the corporations and government around us.  its our duty as americans, and as people who are aware of it to do the best we can to spread the word, and make a change.  were branded ""punks"" and ""dissidents"" and ""trouble-makers"".  know what?  im damn proud of each and every one of those labels, because i can share them with great people...like george washington, and ben franklin.  no one seems to want to remember what  trouble-makers our founding fathers were.  they faced the same corruption in government, and needless censorship we are today.      
      most importantly, they were imperfect men, who could admit to their imperfections...and designed a form of government that can be changed to save it from their own, and the following generations imperfections.  now is the time people.  america is in one of the worst international positions its ever been in, and the corruption is decaying us alive from the inside out, like ebola...check this shit out, and understand!  give yourself the whole story...you deserve it!

"event","""lie awake
things will be better the moment you cant wake up
by the way
when did you realize we're better off without you
you'r lying tongue cant spit filth now
my how the weather changes
hiding your knives behind your back
to strategically place them in mine
when you get home...we are now severed
the glass has been broken for the last time
pulling your tongue till it rips from your face
you've always been ugly but not as nauseating as you look now
i hope you slit your fucking wrists to save me the effort of writing your suicide note
your inspiration was in lies
i see your failure in my eyes
tears burn an open wound
burn away the memories of you
tip toeing to avoid your selfish sob story
after everything we've been through
we've got to crawl...crawl back on our knees
you left with everything you ever wanted
you left us and now you get two thumbs up
you're gettin two thumbs up
you get an F for effort
no more sunday migraines
your eyes will forever sulk with all you've burned down
you think your're so cool now
cause she left you now
and left you crying to yourself
and i cant help but laugh because you brought this on yourself again
in this clip theres 13 ways to say your're sorry
well there's nothing you can say to repair all the damage you have made
all in all you'll never follow through with it
won't you share your revelations
your're ugly and no one likes you"""

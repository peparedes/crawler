"event","Thanks you guys for coming to my birthday dinner.  Yes, I was very surprised.  I think people accidentally dropped enough hints for me to figure it out (like when Annie asked whether Olive Garden took reservations, and when Timin kept having this strange conversation on her cell, and when Emily showed up and started talking quite loudly and insincerely).  But no, I was utterly clueless.  Wanna know how clueless I was?  When I finally went in with Timin and the waiter mentioned ""the table for thirteen,"" I thought he meant Table #13 (for four people).  Seriously, I didn't get it until the last moment, partly because I'm on the dull side when it comes to everyday stuff, and partly because I didn't think anyone would do that for me.  I had a great time (except when the waiters were singing) and I feel lucky to have such great friends.

I'm off to visit Viv tomorrow and I'll be back around September 2...and then it's almost time for the second wave of 2003ers to leave for school."

I didn't think that I missed summer conditioning for volleyball, but still at 7 this morning I found myself at the MSJ track warming up to run with the girls trying out this year.  Maybe I'm psycho.

The Washington Freedom are in the finals!!!  All the odds were against them.  The game was in Boston, where they've NEVER won.  They've beaten Boston ONCE in nine meetings.  This year they've lost to Boston once and tied twice.  And still they managed to hold off Boston through two overtimes and WON ON PENALTY KICKS."

"event","This random old guy at the gym approached me today (not the first time that's happened) and started giving me fitness advice (first time that's happened).  He was pretty built and claimed to be some sort of football coach.  Obviously he wasn't hitting on me, since he was substantially older than my dad, but in his efforts to be friendly he kept making these inappropriate comments.  Like telling me to squeeze this muscle here, to do this exercise to get that ""feminine and toned"" look, asking me if I was trying to look pretty for my boyfriend and whether I was dieting.  I guess the only reason a girl would lift weights would be to impress her boyfriend, right?  Yucky man.  I felt a little harassed.  This is why girls should go to the gym wearing either a) a baggy t-shirt and sweats, or b) a ""talk to me and I'll kill you"" facial expression."

"event","Shopping
After Viv's visit I decided that I wasn't going to go shopping until I went to Portland, but I broke down yesterday for two reasons.  First, I really, really needed a pair of running shoes.  I didn't want to continue clomping around in those sneakers that have already survived two volleyball seasons.  No shinsplints for me, please.  Second, Express mailed me this 25% off coupon that was only good for August 1-3.  So I went.  I bought this pair of jeans at Express (even after the discount it was the equivalent of a 6-hour shift at Baskin Robbins, but let's not think about that) and it fits very well.  A little too perfectly, actually.  I'm thinking that after a few months of college I won't be able to zip them up anymore.

Do I look old enough to be married?
I bought this ring at Ashland that I really liked; it kind of looks like a flower on a vine.  The only problem was that it only fits on the fourth finger of my left hand.  My right hand is a tiny bit bigger than my left so it doesn't fit on that fourth finger, and it's too big for my pinkies.  So I decided just to wear it on my ring finger.  When my mom finally noticed my ""new"" (I've had it for a few months, mom) ring, she insisted that I either wear it on a different finger or take it off.  ""Guys will think you're married!  You'll scare them away!""  I was reminded of Ben, who at Jen Sasaki's party last night told me about the guy at the restaurant who thought this little girl was Ben's daughter.  The party was a lot of fun, even though I suck at DDR and got an E on La Senorita.  Happy birthday Jen!

San Jose @ Washington
San Jose is my home team and I love them and I always support them.  EXCEPT when they play Washington.  So I was pretty happy when Mia Hamm got a hattrick today, both for the team and for Mia herself.  When she got subbed out I thought, ""Good coaching decision.  He's giving Mia a rest and putting the San Jose girls out of their misery.""  But I was wrong.  Abby Wambach added two more goals and San Jose basically rolled over and died.  If Washington had put on a finishing clinic and drubbed any other team, like say Carolina (ew) or Boston (EW), I'd have been thrilled.  But San Jose?  Awwww.  I feel bad.  I hope they can regroup by the time Atlanta visits on Wednesday."

2. I got a tiny tiny sunburn for the first time in my life.
3. I got (even more) in touch with my nerdy side and went to the library.
4. Wambach (of the Washington Freedom) scored on a diving header off Mia Hamm's free kick AGAIN.  This is getting scary.  They score off the same play every time.

And Nigeria is violent...I still haven't forgiven them for beating up our players in the last cup.  So much for all the conspiracy theories about the home team getting the easy draw.  China, on the other hand, gets Australia (mediocre), Russia (mediocre), and Ghana (at #53, has the lowest international ranking of any team in the tournament...I didn't even think there were 53 women's programs in the world).

I can't even remember the last time I had gone bowling.  For some reason, my ball doesn't roll toward the pins, it slides.  There's hardly any rotation involved.  Anyone know why?  Basically I don't bowl, I throw.

Another amusing incident at work...we have these freeze frame cakes, which means that for ten extra bucks, people can have photos printed on cakes.  It's on a thin edible layer, probably something like rice paper.  Anyway, these two twenty-something guys come in wondering whether we would print a naked picture of them on the cake.  Personally I didn't see why not, but my boss, this small, prim & proper Asian lady, had to explain to them that she would feel too uncomfortable/embarassed to look at the picture.

Two weeks without cardio and this is what happens?!  I almost died running a lap around Lake Freaking Elizabeth today.  I swear I have no slow-twich muscle fibers.  Vacation was well worth it though.

SoCal
In San Diego we found a movie theater that doesn't massively overcharge.  And Disneyland was great even though they shut down Space Mountain for renovation (maybe that makes sense...Viv and I went on that thing eight times last time and of those eight times, it broke down twice...not a good stat).  We got in a rather nasty car accident on the way home but I'm convinced that Indiana Jones saved our lives.  One tire got punctured, then two more blew, then we spun two full circles, and then we ended up in a shallow ditch on the left shoulder.  If we hadn't decided to go on Indiana Jones again we would have left the park much, much earlier and there would have been lots of cars on the road...not a good thing since the spinning took us through several lanes.  Plus it was nice that there was a center divider and that we had passed the hilly area.  Getting towed and spending the night with six other people in a single room was interesting.

Kids these days
What are they teaching the kids in school?  Viv's eight-year-old brother kept saying stuff like ""boys go to college and get more money, girls go to Mars and get more candy bars"" and ""girl doctors are called nurses.""  Excuuuuuse me?  LOL.

People are rude
I was informed of something interesting that happened on Friday at work.  So this lady buys some ice cream and pays with a ten.  Then she insists that she paid with a twenty and accuses the girl of stealing ten bucks.  She starts yelling and making a scene while everyone in the store stares at her and she has the nerve to call the cops.  Not the local security guards.  She dials 911.  So the cops come, my boss comes, and she continues to yell.  She starts saying that she's not trying to con anyone out of their money, that she's rich enough to own 4 Baskin Robbins and buy the girl's house.  The freaking security video actually shows the girl putting the ten-dollar bill into the cash register.  So now the lady accuses the girl of putting the twenty into her pocket, except that she has no pockets.  Some people suck.  Hehe...one of the more eventful days since the attempted robbery last year.  Maybe drama is good...better than boredom at least."

"event","Grad Nite was very, very bittersweet.  There are some wonderful people who've made me lose much of my cynicism about high school.  And then there are some friendships that I think went sour, some issues that we've all put off discussing for way too long.  And now I'm left wondering exactly what obligations we have toward friends who either put no effort into the relationship or, for some other reason or combination of reasons, we just never got very close to.  Of course we feel that the way we handled things was justified, but I should probably talk to some people who can offer me an objective opinion.  Right now I just think that we were placed in a difficult situation that always had the potential to turn ugly, and we responded in a very human, and thus flawed, manner.  I'm just trying to figure out what we should have done differently, and what degree of tolerance, selflessness, and maturity can reasonably be expected of a person.

"event","I should really do calc and go to bed but I'm too lazy.  And I realized that I haven't written about Senior Ball or Ashland, but I feel like everyone else has written about it and I don't really have anything particularly original to add.  So quick summary...

At Senior Ball I thought the atmosphere was great.  It was just awesome to see everyone so happy and open to each other.  Maybe I'm being naive about this but I really think the senior class is more united now.  Ashland basically had no educational value (okay at least not for me, as I slept through a lot of the plays) but a lot of social value.  Teehee.  I spent a lot of time just chilling with Timin and talking about random stuff...with other people too.  Oh yes, and every morning Emily and Katina's bed was a total mess (as expected, since they'd fight over the blanket all night) while Timin and mine looked barely slept in.  Yay for still sleepers.

Mia scored a couple of goals on Saturday and got player of the week again.  YAY!  AC Milan beat Juve.  Yawn (not because men's soccer is boring but because I like my Brazilians and wanted Madrid in the final).  WWC2003 is coming to the U.S. for sure now and there might be a tuneup game against Mexico in early September AT SPARTAN!!!  This is good.

Dude Mrs. O'Neill...nuf said.  Yesterday they fed us so much.  There were literally buckets of food.  Right before Senior Ball.  Ugghh we all ate like maniacs and I'm seriously disgusted with myself now. Oh well, it was fun.

Gotta talk to Viv and hear how her prom turned out.

Shannon MacMillan tore her ACL on Sunday.  She's out for the rest of the WUSA season and probably for the World Cup.  She's a fighter but it's next to impossible to recover from that type of injury in four months.  This makes me so freakin sad.  I feel so horrible for her.

Shirley sorry I didn't call you Saturday night.  I still wanna see BLT!  I fell asleep after dinner though.  On Saturday I was so tired all day and I'm not sure why.  In the morning I went running and it was hella weird, I could barely manage a measly lap around Lake Elizabeth.  I wanted to die and/or puke.  Then I went shopping with my mom and kept wanting to sit down.  Then I remembered that on Friday after having a burger at Great America I barely ate anything and I don't think I drank any water all day.  That was dumb.

Sunday I went to Stoneridge with Roger to help him pick out a vest.  Then I worked at night and it was so freakin busy that the two of us seriously couldn't keep up.  No dinner break so the first time there was a customer-less gap the guy I was working with made himself a Chocolate Blast and I started eating tasters of ice cream.  Bad me.  So after five hours of running around we try to close at ten but no, this fatty group comes in right before we lock the door and we get everything dirty again and we're there until 10:30.

Thursday - I wasn't planning on cutting after the calc test since my chem teacher wanted us to be in class, but we didn't get out until around 12:25 and I was too hungry to skip lunch.  I went to El Jarrito with Timin and then home...for some reason I felt like playing soccer so I dribbled my soccer ball down to Gomes to use the ball wall there.  Passed by Curtis on my way there and had to beg him to return the ball to me.  Later Annie, Kat, and Timin came over to make a poster for the senior volleyball guys.  The younger girls on our team made posters for all of the seniors and got us candy and everything for our last home game, but we kind of figured that boys might not remember to do that kind of stuff.  The guys lost to Logan but they played pretty well, especially toward the end.

Friday - I went to work after school and after I got off we went shopping for mother's day.  Went to Q-Cup and saw Crystal working there.

Saturday - Got up, went running, went to the gym.  I watched Washington pound Philly on TV, courtesy of Abby Wambach's hat trick.  Mia Hamm also chipped in with a PK goal.  My parents and I went to this Thai restaurant to celebrate mother's day and then we froze at the soccer game.  It was worth it though to see all three Brazilians on the team score pretty goals.  Then I went to Tapioca with Roger.  Haha he really wants me to help him pick out a tux but I'm convinced that I would be utterly useless...seriously they all look the same to me.  Blah I've been putting off studying for chem and I really have to do that tomorrow."

For awhile I kind of regretted choosing work over club vball, but then again it's really nice to have money and not be asking my parents all the time.  Yes it's materialistic but that's life.  I can still go to free clinics at Clubsport and play intramurals in college.  I miss it.  And that's the last time I'll mention volleyball here.

I seriously could barely squeeze a word out...at one point I was in that stage where you're awake but paralyzed.  So she was getting pretty pissed at this point and finally I managed to roll off her bed.  And then I promptly fall asleep on the ground.  Apparently, though, this is not good enough for her because she needs the door closed and the room completely to herself in order to get ""focused"" and ""calmed down"" enough to fall asleep.  Finally she pretty much yells at me to get the fuck out.  Too bad my 1984 book is still somewhere in the room and I need to find it...more yelling.  Waahhh.  The whole thing was kinda funny."

"event","I miss this weekend.  I want it back.  Originally I had planned to miss 5th and 6th on Thursday and all of Friday, but when Viv came down on Wednesday night I talked my mom into letting me miss both days entirely.  But she was so incredibly paranoid that if I appeared in public during school hours, someone might see me and somehow alert the office as to my whereabouts.  My mom is funny.  So we were stuck at home during school hours, except during lunch when we went to school to pick up Timin, Annie, and Michelle.  Oh and I also showed up to Journalism on Thursday to finish Bend it Like Beckham, which, by the way, is definitely worth seeing.  Plus Mia was in it.  For like three seconds, but still.  Anyway, we ended up playing a lot of DDR because there's really not much else to do at my house.  The rest of Thursday, Friday, and the weekend was basically a big fat orgy of shopping, eating, movie-watching, and Tapioca.  Now I'm extremely screwed in chem but I don't particularly care.  Viv left this morning...boohoo.  Now for the rest of the school year there's not much to look forward to.  Can't wait till we graduate."

"event","So today while I was running, my mind wandered onto a topic that I've discussed with some people, namely Vivian and Shirley.  Being shy sucks.  Or I guess, since I'm not really shy anymore, having been shy sucks.  First thing.  As a kid my parents and family friends would always hella make fun of me for looking so serious all the time.  They'd always f with me and get me all upset and then point and laugh when I realized that they were kidding.  Hehe good stuff.  But anyway none of that really changed me and to this day, I still walk around looking Really Serious.  People always tell me that when I'm sitting in class, I look ""serious,"" ""intellectual,"" or ""pensive.""  LOL.  90% of the time when I'm staring off into space I'm probably either blank or considering my next meal.  So yeah my demeanor makes me kinda unapproachable.

Second thing.  When I feel shy or awkward in certain situations, I don't cower in the corner like an innocent little thing and smile and try to make everyone like me.  I go into defensive mode, which basically means that I close up and act all cold...""I'm not shy, I'm just going to stand here and act like I don't need anyone so THERE.""  So that makes me even more unapproachable.  I think I'm better about it now, but still when I feel vulnerable I'll do it without even knowing it.  The worst thing is that I feel like some people at MSJ look at me and see a brain and nothing else...no heart, no personality.  Maybe that's an exaggeration but I think it's true of some people.  And I'm not going to blame them, because for the above reasons it's likely my own fault.

But getting to the point...I've been extremely blessed to have a couple of close friends who've made me feel that it was almost unnecessary to fight certain insecurities that I had and to reach out to a wider group of people.  But I wish that I had done that.  I just built up so many barriers around myself.  So, those of you who I never got to know - I'm sorry that I didn't.  Excuse my demeanor and please don't judge me because I'm not judging you, honestly.  And those of you who I did get to know - thank you for seeing all of me."

"event","My weekend started off pretty badly because of the calc competition (picked up Shirley and Jeff at 7:30 in the MORNING) but at least that's over now.  Two amusing things.  One, the little junior high kids rushing to the front of the auditorium with their calculators to figure out problems and win prizes.  Two, the fact that a lot of the MSJers there to help run the contest came up to me in hysterics due to a certain person whose style of leadership they found a little overbearing.  Said person's identity shouldn't be hard to guess.

Last night Shirley and I were ""prepping,"" i.e. sitting in Starbucks and Boston Market with our books.  There were some things I needed to get out so it was really nice to talk...thanks Shirley.  I haven't discovered your fatal flaw or deeply-held sadness though.

The people demonstrating against the war in San Francisco are starting to PISS ME OFF.  It's one thing to have personal reasons for opposing the war; it's another to be plain obnoxious just for the sake of being obnoxious.  I'm sure a lot of the protestors are well-informed people but the ones I'm talking about make them all look incredibly ignorant.  So now we have most of the SFPD running around trying to catch these protestors who probably have secret desires to experience the drama of being arrested anyway, instead of doing other things like, say, preventing crime (or getting into brawls over steak fajitas...yes I love the SFPD).  And we have people who can't get to work because they're nice enough not to run over protestors who are, rather stupidly, considering that the drivers are in cars and THEY'RE NOT, standing in the middle of the street insulting drivers for guzzling oil and thus supporting Sadam Hussein.  And we have the socialist protestors who are using the war as an excuse to condemn capitalism in all forms...even little shops owned by people who are just trying to make a living.  Did you ever think that the storeowner you're harassing might have gone to the protest if he didn't have to go to work?  And that it's already hard enough for him to get business and you're just making it harder?  There's nothing wrong with protesting the war, but have some class.  At least go in there with a bigger purpose than just being a nuisance.  Okay that's enough.  I finally crashed from sleep deprivation today...fell asleep sitting up and drooling.  Yuck."

"event","I think two incidents caused me to start to miss playing volleyball.  Not just playing, because I can still do that at Clubsport's free clinics, but being on a team.  First, I watched part of the boys' game against Foothill yesterday.  Second, I read part of Christiana's blog where she talks about how emotionally invested in track she is right now.  I remember how it was during the fall season...I was seriously living volleyball.  And now I'm wondering if there's a relationship between the fact that I'm not playing competitive volleyball and the fact that I think that life kind of sucks right now.  I've been playing pretty much nonstop since seventh grade.  The school, club, camp/rec cycle.  Whenever I get like this I start thinking that maybe I should have kept going.  But then I remember all the reasons why I decided not to play club and I think I was probably right.  One reason: getting to hit outside for MSJ was the best volleyball experience of my life.  Getting a kill is the best feeling in the world.  Unfortunately, I'm too short and not good enough to cut it as an outside hitter on any highly competitive club team, and if I have to go back to only playing D, I'd rather not do it.  Is that a legitimate reason?  It sounds kind of whiny...if I can't play the position I want then I won't play at all.  Jeez that sounds really whiny.  But I can't help it.  For some inexplicable reason, all I ever wanted was to be an outside hitter.  Too bad desire and committment aren't always enough."

"event","First off I'll explain my user name.  If you know me then you probably know that Mia Hamm is my favorite athlete.  One time I saw a Mia-hater who was at one of her WUSA (the women's pro-league) games carrying a sign that said ""HAMM IS NOT KOSHER.""  I got annoyed.  I don't care if ham isn't kosher.  HAMM IS KOSHER."

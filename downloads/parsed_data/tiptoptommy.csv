"event","Here it is folks...the new Tom 2.0.  Right now the page is a ""Work in progress"" being headed by the lovely Miss Erica Gayler -applause-.  With any luck, we'll be able to come up with something totally wicked to put together right away.

In any event, this shall be my document of 2007.  Things are already lookin' good...and it's only the 3rd day of this year.  So lets go over what's happened so far.  New Years day was just a whole bunch of lazy...so much lazy indeed.  There was movie watching, food consumption, and more movies.  On Tuesday morning I awoke, and discovered that there was a message on my cell phone.  When I answered the message it took me a second to realize who it was, but it was Peter...

...We'll stop here for just a sec to fill you kids in on who Peter is in case you don't already know.  Sherman, set the wayback machine for nearly 2 years ago.  Me and Trav were still in Magna Kum Loud, but we were also hitting up open Mic's whenever we could, just for fun, and to get some experience on stages.  We were out one particular night, and this guy gets up on stage, and starts belting out a couple of tunes.  I can only remember 2 of the songs that he played that night, but Trav was blown away.  I recall being indifferent...I'm a retard.  So anyway, Trav went to meet him after he was done his set, and they started talking.  Of course Trav brought up that he played bass, and that he knew a drummer, and asked if this guy was interested in forming a band.  This guy thought that that would be cool, so Trav brought him over for me to meet him.  So this is Peter.  Peter Declan Atherton, and over the course of the next year, he really began to replace Magna as the band that I wanted to be in...he's great...seriously great.  He writes unbelievably good songs that are both musically sound, and well composed...and he knows nothing about music, me and Trav had to teach him what the names of the strings were.  It's insane.  We called the band Declan after his middle name becuase...we...it's a cool name.  So anyway, we played a few REALLY low scale shows in little basement clubs, coffee houses...and a wedding of all things.  Anyway, as good as we were, things got in the way, we never recorded anything, we weren't moving forward, and we started to drift.  Then Trav moved to Ottawa, and I thought that was it.  I hadn't talked to Peter in like 3 or 4 months before yesterday, so hearing from him was interesting.  Anyway back to the story...

...So Peters message was telling me that now that Trav had been back for a while he wanted to do a meeting with me and Trav to see if we wanted to give the band a second go.  This was music to my ears (PUN!!!), becuase ever since we stopped playing...there has been no music in my life.  So last night me, Trav, and Peter all went on a mission from God, and BABY...we put the bad back together.  I'm so damn excited...this could be so much fun.  We're all in better places now, more financially secure, and more willing to work together.  I'll keep you guys informed about what's happening, and you should come see us when we play...we really are that good...I promise.

Other than that...Everything is still awesome."

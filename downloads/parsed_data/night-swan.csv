""Lonely World""

When i reminisce ignorance was bliss,
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cuz the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun living life on the run,
Never had a chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you go the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinking that you know
Everything little thing there is to know
Buy you don't really know, ya know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me it's just a pain in the ass
But i'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last
[chorus]
Another day another night inside a lonely world
Another game another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world
Who's the man (the man in the middle) x4
Maybe i'm a target for people that are bitter
At least i can say that i've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man i hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always putting me down
Just a little skater boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive'em, now i got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still i never want it all, and i never want it now
I just want to cruise, if i loose then i'll figure it out
How the times flies, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's amazing what you learn
When you've never been taught, ya know?
[chorus]
No matter how hard i can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when i cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (such a lonely world)
[x2]
[chorus]"

you are the most likely of the smashing pumpkins to lead a happy, normal life. your innate shyness 
conceals a wicked sense of humour and a fondness for sweet love songs.       <br>

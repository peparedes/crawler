"event","<p>Bipolar disorder, once known as manic-depression, is a psychiatric diagnosis referring to a mental health condition defined by periods of extreme, often inappropriate, and sometimes unpredictable mood states.<br /><br />Bipolar individuals generally experience mania, hypomania or mixed states alternating with clinical depression and euthymic or normal range of mood over varied periods of time. There are many variations of this disorder. Generally, however, a person with bipolar disorder tends to experience more extreme states of mood than other people, moods which can change quickly (many times a day) or last for months. Mood patterns of this nature are associated with distress and disruption, and a relatively high risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is also associated with a variety of cognitive deficits, in particular, difficulty in organizing and planning. The disorder may also skew the ability to judge others' emotion, and alter sense of awareness. Bipolar individuals can be overly observant and analytical of their environment, and in some cases&nbsp;paranoid of others.</p><p>Bipolar disorder is usually treated with medications that help to stabilize mood, and/or therapy and counselling.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that while bipolar disorder alters emotion, there may be a correlation between creativity and bipolar disorder, although it is unclear what the relationship is between the two.</p>"

Back at Albright for a number of days. Worked some. Made a little art. Learned nothing from my past mistake. Repeated&nbsp;past mistake.
Now regretting. Heavily.
Failed my advancement test due to lack of knowing things. Little understanding leads to large faliure.
Still feel alright. Not down. Just cold.
Spending some very well needed time alone.&nbsp;"

"event","<strong>Just because I couldn't scream it from the Roof Tops....I wanted to say to the people I love without question (I didn't put this in any or at all):&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>Dear Jermaine</strong>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You're the best you made my freshmen and sophomore years worth all the drama and head aches. You made long drives back to Philly fun, you made Dorney crazy, and some days you just made me laugh. I don't want to stay here at Albright&nbsp;after you graduate this summer, it'll never be the same...and frankly that's just not good enough.&nbsp; <strong>I love you</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />Dear Sarah (Du),</strong>&nbsp;<br />It was very hard to come to college with out my high school best friend, I was terrified. But for some reason, seeing your LJ and hearing George say you're doing fine makes me feel so much better. Your comments on my LJ, your cute little pics,&nbsp;sad away messages, your uncanny ability to somehow always feel the same way I do. And probably most of all your kind words when I need them the most, and also your great taste&nbsp;in music. I look up to you Sarah I honestly Du (little play on words there). You're a great person, and a great gift to the future just wait to happen.&nbsp;You're definately a gift to me.&nbsp;<strong>I love you</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />Dear Sara (My Roomie),</strong>&nbsp;<br />You drive me right up a wall, sometimes I just want to sock you right in the nose. And some days I want to be some place else when you come around, and I realize that that's because we're getting to be so close and I don't want to let anybody get too close. But I think I slipped up with you, because at this point you're becoming my best friend, 'my sister, my shrink, my savior'. Keep bugging me, keep making me laugh when I want to cry, and keep buying me coffee ice cream, keep taking me to the diner and telling me crazy stories about squirrels, keep healing me of my&nbsp;fuchsia blindness, playing me Placebo songs, keep asking me how you know I'm know I'm gay, keep making me do impressions of that Indian, keep calling me a filthy pirate whore, but whatever you do....don't give up on me, you know why I say that? Because<strong> I love you</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />Dear Ron,</strong>&nbsp;<br />Shut up. You know <strong>I love you</strong> fool.<br /><br /><strong>Dear Elizabeth,</strong>&nbsp;<br />As of this moment at 3:54 a.m., when the sun hasn't risen, when you have a body like a twenty seven year old, while you're the wisest women I know, when you're the only person that just 'gets' it, when there is someone shaving every hair on their body in the bathroom next door, when Brian is&nbsp;probably writing me a new death note, after everyone and Sara's mom came up a told me that&nbsp;our line was the best in the show,&nbsp;while you still have my aviators that look better on you then me, while I owe you seven bucks for the whip, while I owe you my life and my first born child for giving me a good friend, While you understand that friendly obligation, while you're probably denying every nice thing I ever said about you,&nbsp;after I lost everything...everywhere...everytime, before you figure out that you're waisting your time buggering around with me,&nbsp;I just want to say...<strong>I love&nbsp;you</strong>. I love you like nobodies god dammeram business&nbsp;I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />Dear Roadies&nbsp;of &nbsp;Birth, Life, Company, God's gift to me,</strong>&nbsp;<br />When every one else leaves me behind, when all the lights are out, when the tavern closes (that I was never even in), when car drives off and I'm chasing behind it blinded by dust, I'll know that no matter what...you'll be there....say you will, like you never said it before. I know this to be true cause when I had no one else, I had you guys. You taught me everything about being myself, you even taught me how to fall correctly off my skateboard. When I'm with you guys I am at my best. I know this. And I knw that this summer in Vegas I'll be inside 'the bubble like whoa.' If I could split my heart into 16 different pieces, you would each have a piece. &nbsp;<strong>I love you. I love you. I love you.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />Dear Nichole (Shug), Trae(Sean Paul)&nbsp;Trae, and Mia (Kiesh),</strong>&nbsp;<br />My side hurts, I never found my cell phone, that woman in the back of the church with has a ham stuck in her throat,&nbsp; Billy Blanks won't allow me back in Friendly's and there is a&nbsp;man&nbsp;trying to kill me with a leather gun&nbsp;and you know what...I just don't give a fuck. No matter what my problems are you guys make me forget them. I wish though that my phone time with Nichole Giddens would return ::cough, cough:::... Seriously though crew, you keep me sane, and laughing. Summer is almost here..do I hear doom on South or what? <strong>I love you.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Dear Pete,</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You grew me up. I'll never be the same and neither will you. I love you.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>I'm better for it.</em>"

I cooked dinner for me and my roommate Sunday night. We enjoyed it. Then at around 2 a.m. we went snowboarding over on Science hill. We made snow angels, and rolled around for awhile. It was cool, I'll post the pictures when I develop them.
Anywho I really wanted to go home this weekend like nobodies business I did, but I promised Taliah and Sara(the roomie)that I'd go to winter ball. I don't think that they understand that dances and all the crap really aren't my thing. I just want to see my dad and my mom, and to kiss my nephews and nieces. I want to sit down and talk to my sisters about guy stuff. 
EERRR. I don't hate Albright, and it totally pisses me off when people say that they do and then I have to see them everyday. I mean like seriously, if you hate Albright and school so much then leave. Quit paying these people to make you miserable. Blah whatever."

"event","<P>I wanted topost about this earlier....</P>
<P align=left>Okay so recently there have been these cartoons printed in magazines and online about Prophet Muhammad. It's caused outrage amongst Muslims in both Muslim countries and here in America, more so in predominantly Muslim countries. People have been rioting, and boycotting Danish products. People have died. And for those of you who don't know this already I am Muslim. I saw those cartoons and I cried, not just because of what they said but because of what they have done. Let me explain:<BR><B><U>Muslim Beliefs on Prophet Muhammad's Image:</B></U> We do not know what he looks like and so there for we have never drawn pictures or done anything in the way of portraying him. I have been taught that since I was a child. It's a kind of respect so as to say that we could not ourselves create an image as beautiful as what God created. Moreover we do not worship him, we try, in our own lives, to admire him and be like him. That is our way of depicting an image of Prophet Muhammad and his teachings. And so if we ourselves, as Muslims and the only representation of Islam on earth, do not draw him then why would we be comfortable with anyone else doing it?<BR><B><U>Islam and Hate:</B></U> I have been a Muslim for 20 years three months, and nine days; never in my life have I been taught to believe in anything besides peace in Islam. The meaning of the greeting that we are often heard giving to one another is: Peace be upon you. We do not condone hate or violence. Those pictures of my Prophet depicted him as a violent womanizer. <BR><B><U>My Thoughts and Feelings:</B></U> If you know me then you've heard me say at least once that I am a bit of a strange Muslim, but that does not mean I don't love and respect my faith. It is everything I am. I love Islam and Prophet Muhammad more than I can say. And so in light of what has happened as far as the deaths and the offensive cartoons of a man I live my life to be an image of I will be seen with the word ""RESPECT"" written on my hands everyday until I feel that I am no longer disrespected by not only those cartoonists but those who say things like: ""It's about free speech."" Not only that but I will also be seen wearing a scarf (my head covering) that says ""Respect"" on it. Because freedom of speech should not be used as a weapon for disrespecting others.<BR>I SHED TEARS FOR THE LACK OF RESPECT, AS WELL AS THOSE WHO DIED.</P>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah so my holiday at home was well needed. I
had a panic attack on Thursday night (Calm down I'm prone to them
because of stress disorder). I saw my doctor on Friday afternoon and he
decided that I needed to have my dosage of Paxil upped. I feel like a
crazy person, I mean that's what they do for crazy people just before
they put them in a crazy home, they up their dosage of
medication....right?! :::Sigh::: But I'm not sad about it because I've
been feeling a lot less skiddish, afraid and believe it or not I SLEPT
people I went to sleep. It was nice. Dreams were had!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onto the better side of my weekend. Besides
playing lazer tag, going goat cart racing, and just having a freaking
blast with my family on at the EID, I felt great. At two o'clock in the
morning on Saturday (that's going into Sunday) Pete knocked on my door
and then called my phone. When I got up I was like ready to kill this
man...I was having a nice dream. He got me the best gift ever for my
birthday. *Note: I appreciate every gift I've ever gotten scarves,
leaves, anything. I love it all. But there's something to say for a
gift someone gets because they remember you and the things you say.
Doesn't that makes you feel so warm, like you're so...so...someone.
Just, I guess it's harder to explain than I thought it would be. But I
can say I love it. Like when Mia gave me the ear covering from the ear
thermometer that her doctor used when taking her temperature...I loved
that. <br>
Anywho He got me a semi-perfect condition The Jam t-shirt. Now,
everyone who's ever heard my stupid face talk should know the I
absolutely positively love the Jam like nobody's business I do. When he
gave it to me he tried to leave (he doesn't like to be around when
people open the gifts he gives them) but I opened it too fast. I looked
at it, and he said he remembered me saying I loved them. In the words
of one Alda Lizzi:""My heart smiled."" I'm going to hang it on the wall.
It's really hard to find their memorabilia because they broke up so
fast. I've liked them since I was nine years old almost.<br>
I am now on the E-board of Club Mode (the fashion club on campus), I am the secretary. <br>
P.S. Drunk People suck<br>
<br><span style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 51);"">
<lj-cut text=""Just something I need to get out of me""></span><br>
So umm, yeah I have a problem. I always think people dislike me, even
when they don't. Usually I begin to hate people because I am under the
sure impression that they very much dislike me. I can't turn it off.
It's very bad for me because I turn people away, and I lose potential
friends because of this. I am even mean to people sometimes, solely
because I believe they don't like me. I back myself into a corner where
I have no choice but to hate the person in retaliation to the hate that
I have talked myself into believing that the person holds for me. This
is bad.<br>"

Hello there

Days Without Sleep: 5 and counting
Flashbacks: 41 of the same one and counting
Nightmares (I shouldn't call them nightmares solely because they don't scare me, it's just that when I wake up I cry from them): 14 and counting
Hours of sleep: 4 1/2 and counting

I'm going home tonite...maybe that'll help."

"event","Yeah so my birthday weekend was alright, I went home and hung out with my dad and my sisters and brothers (well all except Sabriyah). My brother like went completely insane with my phone and like showed us how to 'chirp' one another..yeah so that still doesn't interest me. I went out to eat with Pete, at this beautiful place where you can look out the window and see all of boat house row. I loved it. We fought earlier in the day, but that was my fault; I was frustrated at other people but I took it out on him. 
 
I had breakfast with Lizzi Saturday morning which was really fun.
 
I gotta tell you though, I was riding home from King of Prussia on Saturday, and I sat next to this like completely ghetto ass girl who felt it was more than necessary to freaking give everyone around her on the bus a full synopsis of SAW 2. She told everyone the ending! Oh wait here's the best part: She wasn't even talking to us, she was actually having a phone conversationg but she was so fucking loud that everyone and their mother heard her. I was angered.
 
I got some new clothing which is kind of cool and the Eid is coming up so I got a new overgarment for that. 
I went on a joy ride with Jason last night and I gotta say I had so much fun, that was like the most awesome birthday gift! Then Jay Jay and I went to have his picture framed at A.C.MOORE, and drop Taliah and the girls off at Wal-Mart and I got some new mags there too which was cool. Then outside of Wal-mart, Jay Jay and I played Rock Steady at full blast and danced for the outcoming people including the girls! 
I spent a lot of the day with Sara, and I'm glad I did cause we had a good time.
I was also serenaded by Gil and that Skinny kid from my floor. Gil played an accordian and the Skinny kid sang and play his guitar."

I hung out with my sister, Bree, that was awesome, and Ron too. I got some new stuff. Sadly I didn't get to hang out with like Mia or Trae and the gang, their Fall break was before ours so they didn[t have time off, and Nikki offered to let me stay the night at her house, so at least I'd be able to see her, but I didn't and now I wish I had. 
Sleep is necessary to continue m life.
There were stupid drunkards like drunk in my dorm one of which was a girl who fel on me and I was forced to yell at her. Well not forced so nuch as was happy to. Either way one of them was told by security to leave and go home, this pissed me off because the guy was drunk, and they let him (made him) drive home. My friend was killed by a drunk driver during my sophmore year, I could barely move when he asked me to come to him. When I got over there he like asked me to take care of his friend in case he never came back to our campus again. Thank you once again Albright security FOR FUCKING NOTHING!


***Also I need a favor homies, if you're reading this then it's becuz like you know me some how, well theres somethings I don't always tell people one of which is that I pray for them. Another would be that I believe in all people's prayers (religious or not). My Aunt is on dialysis right now and I so afraid of what could happen so if pray or anything of that nature please do it for her."

But now I'm feeling a bit better, Jay Jay doesn't even know it but he made me feel so much better yesterday. I keep calling Mia's cell phone but the calls won't go through. It's weird really. 
Ramadan started and I'm glad for that. We should count down too, cause I've only got four day 'til I see Bree and the rest of the gang at home! I have my fall break coming up and I sure am glad for that. What would be awesome is if Trae and Nikki have that time off too, cause we could all hang together. Probably go to Friendly's and visit Nikki hard at work. lol. I miss Trae's fat little head. ***Giggle***. 
Blah otherwise I've been chillin' like ice cream fillin'. 
EWWWWW!!!!And the grossest thing happened this morning, it's crazy really. I was woken at 9:53 a.m. to the sounds of my nieghbor having relations with her boyfriend. It was so loud, and the bed was bangin' against the wall and ugh... it was horrifying. The bizzare thing is that every one on my entire floor and a few that aren't even on my floor have heard them before. I had no idea! This was the first time I'd ever heard it and I freakin' live next door to the girl. I couldn't help but crack up at the whole thing later,...once I got my hearing back that was.
Well watever the case I'm done here I've been tryin' to go to Alda's all day and Like I freakin' keep knockin' and she's either dead on the floor in there or she thinks she has some type of life outside of me!"

     Kay so not much has been happening lately just kind of relaxing mostly. I've been a little out of the ordinary a bit, mostly becuase things have gone awry. I don't understand myself sometimes, if you know me then you pretty much know one thing to be true about me. I hate a liar. Seriuosly, especially to lie to me in the face. As far as I'm concerned you don't exist after that. I've had to cut someone from the already short list of people I almost consider friends, gosh and I was so close this time. I really thought like 'wow, I almost have another friend.' For god's sakes people, I miss having the term 'bestfriend' really mean something in my vocabulary. I miss that feeling that comes along with knowing there's someone out there that's not like growing apart from you, not failing to call you, not turning their back on you, not dieing. I miss that security. And goddarnit if I don't hate the way things have had to turn out for me. Goddarnit if I hate the feeling of knowing that this time, this time I was actually going to say 'hello there...friend!' But fuck it, fuck it all! 
I was immature and I felt so great to day when I was waved at and I laughed in their face like a fucking child. I miss being immature.
     I do have two nice things, there's the fact that Mia has been calling me and saying like hey and just making remember that security. I love that. The there's the fact that I'm going home for one day on Sunday and like my entire family will be there. I've also rekindled."

"event","I don't wanna go back. I don't wanna go back. I don't wanna go back! I'm home and I don't wanna go back to school yet. Mar. Everything's nice right now, except having to go to the hospital with Mia. But otherwise everything's cool...I guess. Anyway I'll be back at school soon working the old slave shift in the cafe and workin' with Linda and everyone. 
I went out to eat with Bree and Ronald last night and that was fun. Live8 was a bust cause we stayed there all of ten minutes, before I like went completely insane and Nichole and I left. We had a pretty good night after that I guess. I still want all four of us (me, Mia, Trae and Nikki) to hang out at least once but with sickie in and out of the hospital that prospect looks bleak. Whatever though she's supposed to come visit me on campus."

"event","Okay so my two week break was nice. I got a few new cd's, went on my first date, lost my life and I am pissed at Nikki cause she's a bitch (she wouldn't walk me home and refused to visit).
 Now I'm back on the slave ship that is Albright dining services and that's fine too. I don't do much of anything. Just sit around, workout, sleep, drink water, and got to work. Gosh I'm just so interesting.
My younger sister is now a married woman, and now all eyes are on me wondering when am I going down that rhode. At her wedding I was made extremely uncomfortable by the amount of people asking when I was next. 
Well it's been good. But I must run I wanna see garden state. (tell me how it ends).

Cd's: Bright Eyes-Digital Ash in a digital Urn
      Taking Back Sunday-Where You Want To Be 
      Billy Talent- Billy Talent (tell all your friends about them they are    
      awesome)
First Date: Awesome
People I still miss: Monday (I saw here though), Trae, Ricky, Ashley, and George. Ronald, Sabriyah and Mia(already)"

"event","Fuck Out Bitches!!! I'm goin' home Monday Mornin'! Yeah! I'm so excited! Yous guys gotta calls me sos I can hang out with you! I'm taken requests LOL. Finals rocked my cock, but now their over and I'm chillin' like ice cream fillin'!The semester's over and that's kinda sad. Everybody's like leavin' left and right it's kind of depressing to see them all go. Sarah left first (my only other Muslim), and I cried. Then Leesh (my roomate next year), and she left me this really sweet letter. It's gonna be hard when Liah and John and all them go. It's been a really rough semester at that.

Thanks everyone that called or e-mailed me to wish me luck on the Fashion Show! It was all appreciated.
Tracey,
Taliah,
Leesh and everyone thanks for such a good go of things.
Sabriyah I love you.
Kim and Jay (summer crew) Thank you so much for us always being the ones that cry! 
It's been a hard semester but I'm glad it's over!
GOOD LUCK AND GOOD SUMMER WISHES!

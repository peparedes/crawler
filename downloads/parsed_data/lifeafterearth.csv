I watched 2Fast 2Furious the other day and the guy on that movie is the cell mate on Prison Break.  He's so funny. Anyway, we're thinking about moving into the basement so our daughter (3) can have her own room.  Any idea's on a smooth transfer for us and the kids?  I'm also trying to find some carpet pieces for the basement floor too.  Yeah good luck for that."

Amy if you read this know that I didn't want to call you or your sisters to babysit tonight.  I thought it was rude to ask you guys to do so so late and on a weekend and Annie is already babysitting Eathan tomorrow.  I couldn't ask you and I didn't know Steve tried to call you guys until after he already did.  Sorry.  Well I hope they're having fun.  I'm always left behind.  Larry would rather have fun than show his loyality to me.  Steve didn't go last time because they couldn't find a babysitter and Kendra had to stay home.  Larry couldn't do that to me.

And on top of being sick i went to work today to install the racing suspension that i got for my birthday on my car, only to find that one of the rear shocks is leaking hydraulic fluid and i cant reseal the strut cause the whole thing is gas pressurized so its going to cost about 130 for some replacements or to get the shocks fixed and resealed. So my car upgrades will have to wait considering the financial situation i'm in (fuckin poor). I was so stoked that i got those shocks and there broke, that teaches me for getting my hopes up. oh yea and being sick sucks"

Parents are getting me a membership to a gym so i can get in to a bit better of shape. I mean im supposed to be at a physical peak at this age. 3 miles and/or 9 beers and/or a deep knife wound to the chest, will kill me. So i should probably get into a scotch better of shape. yesterday was cool, went to tony romas with my family and invited ben along. them ribs were good eating. After ben and i went down to oceanside. went to innnerworld and they said happy birthday and game me a discount on cigarettes which was awesome. then went to the pr0n shop but that shit is expensive so i didn't. Decided to see Hero to burn the rest of the night.

     I have to say that movie was quite interesting. it had a great way of showing character emotions  with use's of color and environment, and tell a story with a really deep meaning. i have to see it again soon just cause it so much more than a normal movie. who wants to go! i'll pay....maybe......probablly not"

someone might get hurt, but it wont be me. 
she'll probably feel cheap, but i'll just feel free, 
and a little bit empty. 
no, it isn't so hard, to get close to me. 
there will be no arguements, we'll always agree. 
and i'll try and be kind, when i ask you to leave. 
we'll both take it easy. 

if you stay to long, inside my memory. 
i will trap you in a song tied to a melody. 
and i'll keep you there so you can't bother me."

Looking good and you know it 
I'm quiet you know 
You make a frist impression 
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind 
Even the best fall down sometimes 
Even the stars refuse to shine 
Out of the back you fall in time 
I somehow find 
You and I collide

For continuing my numbing love endlessly. 
For helping you and myself: not even considering
For beating myself up and over functioning.

To whom do I owe the biggest apology?
No one's been crueller than I've been to me.

For letting you decide if I indeed was desirable
For myself love being so embarrassingly conditional.

Ignoring all the signs that I was not ready,

And
I'm sorry to myself.
My apologies begin here before everybody else.
I'm sorry to myself.
For treating me worse than I would anybody else.

Well, I wonder which crime is the biggest ?
Forgetting you or forgetting myself...
Had I heeded the wisdom of the latter,
I would've naturally loved the former.

For ignoring you: my highest voices.
For smiling when my strife was all too obvious.
For being so disassociated from my body,
And for not letting go when it would've been the kindest thing.

To whom do I owe the biggest apology?
No one's been crueler than I've been to me.

Fear of rejection keeps my heart at bay
Feelings I'd rather not say
I'd rather have you close
Than never at all

You do one thing and
Then I go
Always imagining
Reciprocating feelings that aren't there
Sometimes I think you're aware
Your body languge it gives you away
Maybe I should run
Turn my back
Head for the sun
Feelings left to come undone

Maybe you like what's goin' on
Deep down inside I know it's wrong
I know I should run
It's not even a love affair
I'm makin' plans with the ghost of what was there
I've become a desperate fool
And it's all because of you

<div align=""left"">People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle.<br>Clever, skillful, and flexible, they are remarkably inventive and original and can solve the most difficult problems with ease. There are few fields in which Monkey people wouldn't be successful but they have a disconcerting habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave projects unfinished. Having common sense, Monkey people have a deep desire for knowledge and have excellent memories. Monkey people are strong willed but with an anger that cools quickly. They are most compatible with people born in the years of the Dragon and Rat.</div></td></tr>

School is okay I guess. This is the first semester where all my teachers are guys...weird. 2 are bald as hell and the other two have long ass hair...major icky! This is quite a pointless entry, it's just serving the purpose of me wasting time. I miss people. Like...during the summer...our whole group that was fun. Malina, Fish, Taylor, Rachel, Kid, and Daniel. =( hmmm I should call them. Maybe I will. Well that is all for now.

and it's all in how you mix the two
and it starts just where the light exists
it's a feeling that you cannot miss
and it burns a hole 
through everyone that feels it 

well your never gonna find it
if your looking for it 
won't come your way
well you'll never find it
if your looking for it 

should've done something but I've done it enough
by the way your hands were shaking
rather waste some time with you 

and you never would have though in the end
how amazing it feels just to live again
it's a feeling that you cannot miss
it burns a hole through everyone that feels it 

should've said something but I've said it enough
by the way my words were faded
rather waste some time with you


I can't help but think of *you* when I hear this. Not who you might think."

HA Matty was giving us a demo on what went down and let me tell you I JUMPED! hahaha I feel much closer to him now lol! oy! haha Carrie and I decided that we are now straight. mmmhmm! Due to the fact that we check out gay guys more than the girls...but!!...this is due to the fact that most lesbians are freaking gross as all hell!!! mmhmm. If anyone has an answer for me as to why this is...i would love to know. I saw ONE...yes ONE...cute girl all damn night... and then we freaking lost her!!! dammit! She was hot...do you concur Carrie? lol So I am supposed to go down to LB and have lunch wif Carrie and Julie then go to a movie wif Stacey BUT that is not going to happen due to the fact that I must go and pay for my classes today.

OOO and btw I absolutely LOVE Chris!! He is completely adorable hehe and he's a Sagittarius so that is even better!! =) And a little warning out there to all of you pizza eaters....when you look at a container that looks like it has parmasean(sp?) cheese in it...do a taste test BEFORE applying it to your pizza!! Chris and I found out the hard way that it wasn't the pizza that was salty...it was the SALT we poured on it! Dammit!!! ""This pizza is good...but it's kinda on the salty side"" hahahaha!! great stuff. And I thought the NoNo outfit for the night was ""the cruise ship"" couple!! hahaha =x And YaY for Matty finding a German guy!! Jens!! And Carrie...what is that Ani song called??

"event","*she* IM'd me...I ignored it for awhile...until I couldn't handle it. I replied and we talked serious for awhile...until she said something that made me smile. She makes me smile even when I am mad at her...That is why I love her. It won't stop. I have tried. I no longer want to be with her or anything like that. It's just this weird connection...and memories that make me happy. I forgot how she makes things feel so, safe. She made me cry. but it was almost a happy cry...i don't know. I told her my lip hurt and that she should fix it (cuz its juss something i always say to her) and she said ""well tell me how to fix it and i'll do it"" ::sigh:: I remember the days when I would feel like complete shit and all she would have to do is hug me or (do something I can not say because its a secret!) but yea and i would instantly feel better. She has a power that no one else has...I guess I gave it to her.  


I want to feel that way with someone...someone I trust, which is doubtful. I am Broken."

Can you hear me?
Am I gettin' through to you

Hello
Is it late there?
There's a laughter on the line
Are you sure you're there alone?

Cause I'm
Tryin' to explain
Something's wrong
Ya just don't sound the same

Why don't you
Why don't you
Go outside

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone, too long
If you lips
Feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn.
Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the nights
As empty for me as for you
If ya feel 
You can't wait till morining

Hello 
Do you miss me?
I hear you say you do
But not the way I'm missing you

What's new?
How's the weather?
Is it stormy where you are?
Cause I'm so close 
But feels like you're so far
Oh would it mean anything
If you knew
What I'm left imagining
In my mind


I don't miss you...I miss the feeling of us."

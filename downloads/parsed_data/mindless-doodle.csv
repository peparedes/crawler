"event","Okay. First night in my new dorm room and I'm already out of pocky (Um brilliant Japanese candy) >.< Ugh. It's going to be a looooooong week.
There is this freshman party basically in the middle of the campus and I decided that I hated it almost immediatley, I went there for three minutes and walked very very quickly back to my dorm room. I don't care if I don't get to meet anyone and if I'm by myself and lonely for the rest of the year I was not hanging out with a zillion people walking much too close to me and listening to country music. I would have almost been fine with the people, but once I got within hearing distance of the music I decided it was so not happening.
Hooray for me, I also have managed to break my finger on the first freaking day I move on to Campus. WTF? Why does this shit happen to me? I basically spent my whole life in the nurses office today. It sucked.
Anyway. I guess I will attempt to give the stupid party another chance? Ugh. Country. Ugh.
On the brighter side my art classes start soon :D"

We got back from the beach yesterday, I'm slightly sunburned, not enough to actually be tan because being as pale as I am I will probably never actually _be_ tan. It's probably the first time I've been ""outside"" for like, a year. I don't think I've been outside long enough to get an actual sunburn for forever though. I'm not exactly peachy keen on tanning.
I don't really know why I'm writting. I'm just killing some time before I can drug myself and sleep. >.<"

Not all of them because I'm not 18 yet so I can't slice but I do have to make up some of them because our store is kinda understaffed right now. Swear I'm gonna kill her.

In other news my mom picked up a drawing table for me from one of her friends. As far as I understand those things are pretty price-y and I'm getting it for free! Which is awesome because now I won't have to worry about buyuing an easel for awhile. :D"

"event","Yesterday at work I'm having an OK time considering I _really_ didn't feel like working. I basically putzed around and was practicing my moonwalk, is that weird? My co-workers thought I was on something yesterday.
Anyway! On to the creepy-ness. We sell these things called whoopie pies, they look like giant size oreos, icing cream stuffs in the middle and like a cake out side (I think they are disgusting but for some reason they are ridiculously popular) Well one of the vendors came in to buy a drink and a sandwhich before he left and he was talking to my co-worker M.

M- ""You know what these are called?""

vendor- ""Nah what?""

M- ""Whoopi pies!""

vendor- ""Really?"" He's grinning, giving the chershire cat a run for his money.

M- ""wouldn't you like a real whoopi right now?""

They start discussing this in front of me and the topic turns to something like would he enjoy it if her clothes were off, something to that effect, I wasn't trying to pay attention you know? Then I hear:

M- ""Hey! None of that now, She shouldn't be hearing that kind of stuff!""

vendor- ""She'll hear it sooner or later""

me- (I should have been paying attention to the conversation before I said anything but I opened my dumb mouth) ""Oh my virgin ears can't handle this""

M- ""Her virgin ears, you hear that?""

vendor- ""Here we are corrupting her. Come here"" (He points to me and motions me closer I hesitate and he gets more persistant, I lean over the counter towards him, you know what he does? He sticks his freaking finger in my ear! Then says ""There I think that should take care of that!""

I was horrified! If it would have happened to anyone else though I probably would have been hysterical."

I'm so excited!! Harry Potter is going to be out soon! I have been waiting forever for this book, it's almost pathetic with how much I'm devoted. I remember reading Harry Potter in third grade and going to 'Harry Potter' parties for the last three books that came out. I'm scheduling off for work so I can go to the last one with a friend, were dressing up ^.^ I feel so nerdy it's unbelievable.

I just have to keep it quiet around my parents. My dad told me I was never ever allowed to youtube, or make a video journal and post it, but this isn't a video journal and I probably won't post it. Instead I'll enter it in my schools video fair should they choose to have it this year. It's going to be amazing. I hope so anyway.
In other news I started driving again. With my permit. That I've had for two years. Is that not pathetic? Why can't I just get my license like a normal person? I'm such a retard. I went to drive my dad home and I almost got hit by a car that I didn't even see. I'm such an idiot, no wonder no one can stand me >.< If I were anyone besides me I wouldn't talk to me ever.

"event","The kid from England came over last friday, he's now staying at my friends house. We ended up never having his welcome party because we never called anyone and I was still in Virginia. Oops! So I got to meet him monday when we went to Hershey. I can't understand a word that kid says. I needed him to repeat everything he said to me almost all day. I was totally amazed that he had no idea what Hershey was (um...chocolate!!) and he was hysterical over the fact that we had a whole amusement park dedicated to chocolate. We had to leave early because The sister wanted to leave, she promised to buy us more tickets for another day if we left by 3:00. She wanted to leave so she could go visit her girlfriend. We left the park (We stayed for a total of 4 hours, that was a total ripoff) Then we dropped of my friends sister at her girlfriends house and I made Jon (the English kid) Quote stuff from Monty Python on the way home 'cuz he sounds better than we do :)
Then yesterday I went with them to the mall and he bought a PS3 because it's cheaper here than in England, my friend got extremely ticked off because he still never paid her back for the plane ticket (700$) and went and bought a PS3. Then they have to spend another week together next week when they go to SC.
Meh. That's it really, nothing intereting anyway."

"event","It's been awhile since I wrote. Not just in this journal, but in my real journal too. Which I might just throw away considering all I do is draw in it anymore. My mom would have a heartattack if she knew I was going to do that though, for some reason she saves everything for ""sentimental reasons"" I wouldn't be surprised if she has wrapping paper from my first christmas in the attic >.<
Speaking of paper I just got a bunch of freezer paper :) To normal people it's no big deal but this now means that I can spray paint and stencil my jeans without it looking terrible ^.^
Oh and a small rant:
I am tired of being hit on at work!! It's really annoying/ very creepy when an old man comes up to the cash register and starts staring at my chest, openly I might add, then tries to give me a tip (which isn't terrible I was just angry about the chest thing). There is more perverted-ness with people at work but I don't feel like typing it anymore. I'm just tired of being hit on by creepy old men. Gods.
Oh another rant? I'm tired of not being able to read my friends instant messages because they can't write in proper English. I mean, I know I don't have the worlds most perfect grammar but at least you can halfway understand what I'm going on about. I can string a sentence of words together and for the most part it's spelled right and you can understand it. All it takes is a couple of extra seconds.
My final rant: My best friend is inviting this kid over from England right? I mentioned that a looooooong time ago. I am going to kill him when he gets here. She is spending around 2,000 dollars on this kid and then I find out that he isn't going to pay for it. He's not paying for any of it, not even half of it. He's buying a playstation three. My friend is not rich. She might not go to college now because she can't save up the money/ she's already in debt. And he doesn't care! Then he has been mean to her for the past month and he is manipulative and rude. Not to mention extremely perverted. (For the most part I can handle perverted people but he is just disgusting)
That's all my ranting. I was told that when I rant, I don't really rant that people know others alot worse than me who could go on for hours. In comparison I guess I'm doing good ^.^

Much love!"

I skipped school to (long pause for suspence) the mall. Yes, I skipped school to go to the mall.

Then I got my nails painted for the first time ever at some random salon with my step sister. The guy who did my nails barely spoke english. The english he did speak was heavily accented. I felt bad for keep having him repeat himself so I ended up just nodding my head alot and pretending to know what he was talking about >.< I'm so stupid sometimes. 
Then I went to my interview early for work and she told me I could start monday at four. I'm getting paid minimum wage, but it is so much better than getting paid 2.83 an hour waitressing. Then she told me that in July minimum wage is getting bumped up to 7.25 an hour, huzzah-ness!!"

me: ... ok ...

We sit down

me: I suck at memorizing things. I'm kind of slow.

me: ...

manager: wipe menus and I'll be back to talk to you

me: ...

15 minutes later

manager: I really like you, you are a really sweet girl but I'm going to have to let you go.

me: ...

manager: I just don't think you are cut out to be a waitress, it's not for everybody, and I don't think it's for you.

me: I understand. It's ok, I think I'm going to be called back by Moyers. 

manager: That's good, you can use me as a reference.

Then she paid me for my apron, let me sign in for an hour instead of the fifteen minutes of work I got and I left >.<
It's not a terrible thing because I am in fact, getting hired by Moyers, they called me back on Saturday. If things don't work out there I can get a job at the pizza place near where I live that I believe is hiring anyone who will walk through the door.

Why do bad things happen to me all at once!?!

Oh. and I'm finished with that stupid twelve page report, I only have eleven pages and I don't even care. It was supposed to have references and all this other crap, I basically BS'd most of it and gave my opinion for the other half. I'm too depressed to even care."

I complained alot about the le EX boyfriend because he decided to dump me just in time for prom which is next weekend and I am still DATELESS but I must go because I already got a dress that I can't return XD, Damn him. Then my step mother told me the most encouraging thing I think she's said to me ever: ""There are plenty of great guys out there, you just don't see them 'cuz you've got all that hair hanging in your eyes."" And I got all mushy and stuffs.
My cousin and I talked and acted crazy, crazy enough to embarass my step mother in Walmart tee hee. We were dancing around acting like real goofs. I miss her so much already and I can't wait for her to come over during the summer.
SPEAKING of the summer Draco's boyfriend (they both deny it but I know it's gonna happen) from ENGLAND is coming over to visit her for two weeks and go on Vay-K with her to SC (he took my place TT.TT I was gonna go to SC with her this year) She's spent 700 bucks on his plane ticket and a good 200 for him to go on Vay-K with her. I felt so bad for her too I told her she best enjoy him and he should be at her disposal for the two weeks because she's paying for his sorry self. But he's coming ^.^ I get to meet him, we're planning a party and everything. And I'm buying the welcome mat (I know, that doesn't make a lick of sense to anyone else but whatevers) 
Besides all that crap I dyed my hair strawberry blonde (I wanted to put blue streaks in it but as always that was a no way in hell from my father) I had convinced my step mom to let me dye it brown but then picked up the strawberry blonde for god knows what reason but I think I like it this color."

"event","Le Boyfriend just broke up with me! Via telephone! Remember all those times I went and said I should just break up with him? Well I didn't, who knows why. On the phone he told me he had been thinking about it for the past month. Should I have known that I would have broken up with him loooooong ago. In a way I'm relieved but I'm also very pissed off because I spent a half a year with that creep who didn't ever want to spend time with me or anything and spent more time with my best friend than he ever did with me.
The only thing I'm extremely pissed off about is prom. What am I going to do with this dress??? He asked me if I still want to go as friends. Can you say hell no? That would be very uncomfortable for the both of us."

Other than that there isn't really anything new. I've doodled some, and I could quite possibly be getting a drawing table from a lady who wants to donate it to the goodwill. My mom asked me if I wanted it and I was like heck yessum I wants it. Those things are amazing, plus really 'spensive.
Oh. I also have to finish a report for a book I didn't finish reading. I have to write a whole 12 pages of crap that I won't be able to BS my way through. I'm going to use very large font and possibly as many footnotes as I can. Oops!"

"event","Great mood today :)
I watched Jackass (the movie) for the first time ever this weekend on MTV normally I'm not a TV person but I was stuck at our hotel for _forever_ when we went to visist the grandparents. I have to say I am still surprised thast Misty married Bam even though he's a  total ass hole. RP was just telling me she saw them in Starbucks the other day coming back from her college visit and he got ticked off and slapped her in the middle of the store. If that were me I would be throwing a fit.
ANYWAY (See how I ramble on?) I visited the grandparents, I finally got my prom dress (it's pink, the color I hate most, how does that one work out??) And got a couple T shirts and lots of chocolate ^.^
My Aunt is visiting us from Virginia and she brought the baby, she's getting so big she is the cutest thing ever. When I told Draco about her she started going off on me about how I never wanted kids yet I'm telling her the baby was cute -.- My reaction? I'm still never having kids, but I will always think they are adorable hah! (That didn't make a lick of sense did it?)
Anyway. Finished my homework, still need to vaccuum, and huzzah!! There are new episodes of Marmalade boy on On Demand. That show is old school anime but I still love it. I enjoy screaming at the screen and the stupidity of the people I mean don't you think that it's weird that you are dating your step sister??
Oh well. Supper is calling ^.^

I'm also excited because my bib cards for English are almost complete, and I was given a paper crane from Sabwhich I taped to my locker. Then later she told Andy that I was pretty. Not being (or at least I'm trying not to be) stuck up and superficial but it's nice to hear that from random people you never talk to lol."

"event","Ok-aaaaaaayyyyyyy. I am giving up art forever!! I swear to god I'm going to shove a spork through my eye. Forgive me for being EMO!! Here are two short rants: I got a 90% on the art project I spent half of my weekend on, and worked super hard to complete. While a person who is my ""friend"" but I don't really like because she's into my boyfriend and DOESN""T EVEN CARE THAT I'M GOING OUT WITH HIM!!!!!!!!! Got a 95% on her project that she didn't even bother to try on. She basically glued crap to it and that was it. I'm not trying to compete with her, I swear I'm not. But really, She is better at me in _everything_. If she can glue crap to her project and not even work on detail, still get a better grade than me than why should I bother? Why? I am such a bitch. Why do I do this? WHHHHHYYYYYYY????????????????
Ok. Rant two: I AM NOT EMO
I never was, I never will be. I am an individual who does not particularly like being put into a category that everyone automatically assumes that you 1 cut yourself 2 Hate life and 3 Are too much of a pansy to commit to just being goth.
Why is veryone so stuck on labels anyway? If I get called emo one more time I swear I really will cut my wrists and smear my blood all over their freaking face. HAH! HAH!!!!

Ok. I think I feel a bit better. In a minute I'm going to get myself a cup of coffee, sit down, read my magazine and chill."

"event","It's Saturday and I have absolutley nothing to do. Normally that kind of thing doesn't bother me because normally I enjoy time by myself but I am seriously annoyed because I actually want to do something and no one is home. Namely Le Boyfriend. He is spending time with my ""friend"". They have been doing a lot of stuff without me lately. I'm not going to pretend that it doesn't bother me any more because it's pissing me off. Honestly. If he wants to be with her thats fine, but just tell me already!! I'm tired of being dragged around waiting for something to happen when its not. Oh and that ""friend"" (who really was never much of a friend she was more of a bitch) admited to Draco, that she would go out with him if we weren't dating. Even though she knows that Draco would do anything to screw her over. How dense do you get? I'm not trying to be mean but I'm tired of le boyfriend spending more time with that girl than with me (I'm not even exaggerating, he spends so much time there that his friends call her house first to see if he's there!!) And my ""friend"" or ""that girl"" is totally playing along with it! Hello??? We are supposed to be friends, friends don't do this to each other!!!
Oh and I thought, I didn't even think. I was convinced that I was going to get a job at that gas station. They never called me back. In fact no one called me back from any place that I put an application in. I qam about to tear my hair out, all I hear anymore is you have to get a job, you have to get a job, and no one calls me back!! I am so frustrated! And I still don't have a dress for the prom I don't even want to go to, with the boyfriend that is more interested in my friend than me. I feel like shit because he doesn't want anything to do with me, I was free everyday this week. He came over once and had to leave at seven. He goes to that girls house and spends almost all night there. Thanks a whole fucking bunch guys. Way to make me feel special.

And the stupid mood thing doesn't have any of the moods I'm feeling, stupid, ugly, shitty, detestable, piece of crap daughter, and failure  should be added to the list. I'd make a mood tag thing myself but I'm too lazy and untalented (there's another feeling to add!!) to do such a thing. I quit. I quit. I quit. I quit!!!"

Now we are getting hit with a crapload of snow, it's up to about a foot now and still snowing. I have to go out in a while and help my dad finishe off shoveling people's driveways in a while because it's snowing too fast to get anything done/ Worst part of this is is that it's only 9 and the snow isn't supposed to stop until 8 in the morning.
Oh yeah, and I left my report in my locker at school and I have to rewrite the whole stinking paper because it's due on monday. I could freaking shoot myself sometimes for being so dumb.
Oh yeah and Brad the kid from my bus is officially freaking me out. He is a creepy kid no joke. And even more news? I'm thinking about breaking up with le boyfriend, but I don't even know what to do with that situation.
I might also be actually getting a job (finally!) because someone is actually hiring! I got an interview sort of thing and everything. The only thing was is that I wasn't dressed super nice because I wasn't expecting the manager to actually bethere that day, so I was talking to her in a pair of old jeans and a paint covered sweat shirt I just hope that she didn't mind. Grrr at me. Dumb dumb me."

That kid has the spontainity of a rock. Anywho, I was doing great remembered everything.

So I went to the restaurant and this snotty girl I know from school was there, just for the record I never ever want to work with her ever. She gave me a form, it was _not_ an application, but I wasn't going to argue with her because I was already nervous about getting an application and I was already nervous because I was talking to her so I left. Today I was dragged (okay not dragged :P) back up to the restaurant to get an application and they weren't hiring any more TT.TT and I felt like an idiot because the girl I didn't like very much kept giving me an evil glare and I was not a happy camper. I left without an application and my step mother was unhappy because I did not listen to her and get an application like I was supposed to. So then we went to the gas station to get another application and lo and behold there's another kid from school I don't really like (does anyone see a pattern forming here?) and they didn't have any applications I'm supposed to stop back tomorrow. Then we went to the Pizza place across the street and they gave me an application. Then we went to another pizza shop and they couldn't find them I'm supposed to stpp back tomorrow when the manager is in. Then huzzah, a promising job oppertunity that I think I would like working at, an ice cream shop. That one of my sisters friends owns :) Got an aplication. Then the last stop was at a small grocery/gas station. It wasn't so bad, except for the part that my 14 year old step sister is applying with me XD She doesn't need a job! Now that I've got that off my chest. It also didn't help that everytime I went in to get an application I started shaking, not just a light little non noticable shake either. A very noticable shake. I am a basket case. I hope my parents don't bring this up when I'm getting tested for my learning disorder. I am going to die from ambarassment. Really I am.

I said I was going to paint her something and then I remembered that collage I made her for her last birthday and how she turned it in to get into year book and got credit for something I made. Then I thought ""yeah, no freaking way I'm ever doing that again.""
Matt and Alyssa got back together. In a way I'm really happy for them because now they are both happy again. But I'm also very upset in a totally selfish way. Even though Alyssa is one of my friends and everything I've always liked Matt, ever since we went through confirmation together (confirmation sucked, especially considering I didn't believe, and still don't believe half of it) I've always liked him. And then he finally admitted to me that he liked me, after he was already going out with Alyssa XD It killed me. A teeny tiny part of me wanted them to be finished. I know I'm horribly selfish. Damn it Matt :(
Anywho, My best friends internet buddeh (boyfriend teehee^.^) from England is coming to stay at her house for awhile!!! I think I'm just as excited as she is ^.^ Number one 'cuz he's cool beans being from England having an accent and everything and number two because it saves me money because now she won't drag me to England right after highschool, which I don't believe my father would allow me to do anyways. We had promised that if I met her internet buddies she would meet all of mine with me. I just never thought it would really happen. She's so excited, she just has to figure out how to ask her mom if he can visit.
Oh yeah, and I'm definetly (spelling?) feeling the effects of pillow polo yesterday, I ache all over from running, and my wrist still hurts a little. But the game was great, and I didn't manage to break my stick this time :)
And for the first time in history I skipped an art club meeting. I am terrible, and I feel terrible. I wonder how mad the teacher is at the club, I know I didn't finish my poster, apparantly nobody else did either. I think he is going to flip out, or rather did flip out? At the meeting today."

Before the snow we went to the store to stock up on bread and milk, like everyone else, and my friend A was working. I stopped to talk to her and she started bawling. I felt terrible, I didn't know what to say, I don't do well with emotions. It turns out her dog died on Sunday from cancer, I felt so terrible. But she seems to be doing much better today.
Merg. And both Matt and Alyssa were upset because she decided to break up with him today at lunch. She cried all through fifth period and Matt was upset during ninth he hugged me and told me he was getting smashed tonight and if he comes in tomorrow he's probably going to be hung over. I love them both but I just want to sit them down and be like ""why are you doing this to yourselves??"" but it's none of my buisness I suppose.
Oh and I was forced to agree to go to my mothers Mormon Luncheon thing on the condition that I got to go back to my dads house early. Most of the people are nice but then I met this 8th grade girl that followed me around for an hour who wouldn't stop talking, and continued to make me angry because every other word out of her mouth was a curse and she kept making fun of Bi people telling me how she thought they were disgustiong. I couldn't take anymore of it and refused to speak. Then she asked me if I was Bi because she was worried that she offended me. Agrrrrrr!!!! Yes!! You offended me!! If you are going to be a close-minded brat at least keep your opinons to yourself.

My friend was crushed. So I begged my dad to let me go to applebees with her, it was fun. I ordered this baked lime chicken thing and when they brought it out for me I swear there was more on that plate then I eat in a week!! I only ate half of the rice and I'm still eating left overs for breakfast.
Anywho I gave her my gift a JamisonParker CD she has been bugging me to copy for her forever (So I finally got her the real thing :D) and I gave her my painting I made for her. I don't know if she really liked it though, she didn't say much about it. Normally she gets excited when I paint her something but she didn't say much about this one. I knew I should have just washed out the stupid canvas and painted something else :(
My mom is taking me to look at prom dresses tomorrrow, she called and told me we could stay an extra night at dads and mentioned shopping. I loathe shopping with her she makes me try on _everything_ because she adores dressing me up, and has told me this on many occasions. I'm not a Barbie. I'm almost tempted to go to prom in jeans and converse. It'd be much more comfortable than a dress :) Anywho about the dress, she was all I put aside 300 dollars for your dress and I got a little freaked out. She's always complaining about how she's short on cash and I don't want her to spend money on me. I said ""oh well I have a dres I can use"" and she told me about the money and how she specifically saved it for me. Without thinking I blurted out ""Why don't you use the money to spend on my brothers braces?"" My dad shot me a dirty look. It was a real open mouth insert foot thing. She already was forced to pay for his braces and I didn't even know, mydad was a little ticked off at me because he doesn't want her to think that he has been complaining about her. I felt horrible (still do) and I probably hurt her feelings terribly (even when I shouldn't care because well never mind, there are tons of reasons I don't feel like getting into)
In other news I found my new old MP3 player, my old one didn't work so I borrowed my ""new"" one from my stepmommy and after two or three months (maybe longer?) I finally put songs on it. I managed to drop it twice already, I'm a real klutz XD
Oh and I got my spaghetti porqupine back from my art teacher. I got a 94 showing me it wasn't really worth my effort to try and save the ""quills"" that kept breaking off. Everyone in the class pretty much got 94's. And almost all of the ""quills"" broke off when I tried taking it home. People kept breaking them by ""accident"". My teacher told me my design was interesting and one of her favorites. I was surprised, I hated it and thought it looked like a piece of crap. I wonder what she would say if she found out that I stepped on it when I got home and took pictures of the pieces?"

Since it won't let me post a new entry I'm just going to have to edit it. Took a nice long walk (3 and 1/2 miles about an hour) I feel much better.

"event","I am bored to tears, and getting annoyed at my cat who bats her jingly bell cat toy from one side of the room to the other for the past hour. And people won't stop calling the house for snowplowing. You would think after three days they would have had it finished themselves already. Not that I'm complaining, I think my dad could always use the buisness but I hate answering the phone, I never know what to say and I hate talking to people on the phone that I don't know it makes me a nervous wreck. When my father gets home chances are he'll be ticked off at me because I've been telling the customers the wrong info. and he will yell at me again. i'm tired of being yelled at all the time. I'm trying my best yah know? It feels like everything sets him off, and then he says the meanest most hurtful things, like I'm throwing my life away and I'll never be anybetter than my mother and I should go on Welfare now. Then people wonder why I'm a basket case. Enough complaining. No one wants to hear my sob stories :)
I've been on the net all day, (and craftster is down!!! I'm so upset!!) I should probably get some other stuff done."

Le boyfriend wanted to take me out to eat tonight for V Day and the snow saved me, (the only thing snow is god for :P). It's probably not normal for a girl to avoid her BF at all costs but at this point I don't care, he's driving me nuts. I feel like the most ungrateful, meanest, lothesome person on the planet right now (because I am) Grrrrrrr. I finished his gift today, I did a bit of procrastinating before I finished it. I was lucky it snowed or I wouldn't have finished it in time.
My dad is calling my Algebra teacher sometime this week to give him a warning on the whole IEP thing. I feel so dumb :( The wort part about it is I know exactly how to do the work I just blank out when it comes to tests. Parents were saying stuff about test taking anxiety. Blah. Mild case of ADD? Blah. Anxiety in general. Blah again.
I'm so excited for this weekend woot! We're going to visit my baby cousin in Virginia!!!! She's the cutest little drool machine eva! Huzzah!
Other than that my life is relativley boring, I could keep complaining, and rant about trying to find a college and do the whole scholarship thing but I don't feel like it right now."

Brad sang to me on the bus today, told me I was awesome, the coolest person ever, and pretty. Then asked me for a drawing of Gir which I agreed to draw for him because I enjoyed the flattery thing, it's not something I get often. :P That kid is cool, a little weird he's awesome possum but just doesn't know it yet.
Meh. Other than that I'm being pretty unproductive, I need to work on some of my projects and art stuffs."

And as much as I would love to knock people's heads together, beat them with a broken limb and then push them off a bridge I would never do it. Unless of course it was my Algebra teacher. Kidding! I'm perfectly sane I swear! ""The last couple of days my enteries everywhere have been kind of rant-y, and a little psycho. I feel bad 'cuz who really wants to read someone's issues when they have their own? I'm just going to shut up now thhis isn't making any sense. :(

Anywho, even though I hate football I'm watching the game today for the commercials of course. Someone is taking the hour drive to get the wings from Quaker Stake and Lube to get wings for the game. I was suprised that they would want to watch, I thought they would be disgusted that the steelers weren't in it. But I guess Superbowl Sunday is Superbowl sunday. I'm probably going to do the anti-social thing and watch the game in my room so I can ignore the game and see the commercials but sew at the same time. I'm almost finished with my skirt. I'm determined to have it done so I can wear it tomorrow. That's it I suppose, rant is over."

Want to know what's more pathetic than not having a BF? Having a BF for three months that you have never kissed, hugged only four times ever, and held hands with only once. I'm not even exaggerating! I don't even know why he bothers calling himself my boyfriend. 
I could probably write a book, how to be a spinster for the rest of your life. I don't know why I'm complaining I think he's just going out with me to get to Ells who is the cause of all of my depressing thoughts lately. They are both on my shit list and probably deserve each other. Merg!!!! I'm so frustrated with the pair of them, I want to knock their heads together, rip their legs off and beat them over the head then push them off a bridge. That's exactly how I feel :("

One of the side panels broke off this morning and I had to quickly glue it and leave, brilliant me decided to dry it with a hairdryer which of course made the hot glue melt and my progect started to fall apart. I am so frustrated, I'm painting it, letting it get graded and I'm spashing it with a hammer or something, then I am going to burn the pieces. I'm not eve kidding, I'm even going to take pictures of the process Bah! I've painted the stupid thing red and orange. It's symbolizing my frustration. Ok, that was a lie, I just like the color red :P
We got three new algea eaters for our fish tank and there is only one left, our turtles are eating them, it's kinda funneh :)
I am also a little annoyed, my bf is at Ell's house. He has spent more time there tonight then he has ever total at my house. And I'm ticked off at Ell's just 'cuz she is her.

"event","My teacher was talking about this Wallaby that was loose near my hometown and how if she goes home she might see it. This redneck kid (Roth) who is hilarious but also very weird suddenly shouts from the back of the room, ""Are you going to shoot and stuff it Mrs. D?"". She gave him this shocked look, it was so freaking hilarious, she must have forgotten that we live in the most redneck part of the country. (when you say you're from PA every one immediatly thinks you are either a redneck or amish hah!) 
Roth then starts going on about his prized collection of deer he shot and how the heads are mounted in his bedroom. Mrs. D was still shocked, then he started talking about how he wanted to kill a kangaroo and stuff it, stick it next to his couch and use the pouch for a magazine holder. I almost PMSL.

In other news
Last night my dad freaked out about this T shirt that keeps ending up in his bedroom, it's just a plain gray T shirt, I have one just like it. He thinks it was mine so he kept tossing it in my room. I thought it was my step sisters so I tossed it next to her dresser, she then threw it in my dad's room. Apparently this trend kept up for about a week and my dad had had it, he comes into my room and asked if I put the shirt away, my step sister said that she tossed it in his room. My dad grabs the T shirt and returns to my room with T shirt in hand and starts saying that he never wants to see it in his room again and out of no where he rips the shirt in half. 
I started freaking out, I was halfway between laughing and crying and my step sister storms out of the room and is all ""Well now she's going to be mad at _me_"" to my dad, my dad looks at me and asks ""ARe you crying?"" and I nodded still freaking out he then asks if I was going to cut it up anyway and I said no because I planned on making it a sweatshirt. My dad ""oh's"" hands me the torn shirt and walks out of the room. I suddenly realize that my shirt was in my dresser. I checked my dresser and sure enough there is _my_ gray T shirt sitting on top of my other shirts still intact and not torn. I looked at the torn shirt my dad gave me and relized that it was his shirt. He tore his own gray T shirt and didn't even realize it. I started laughing histerically, it made my night. ^.^ Now I have my gray T shirt and a torn gray T shirt I can use for material.

Other than that my life is pretty boring right now, I'm making a porqupine out of spaghetti for 3D design and I'm eating ramen noodles while posting this. I'm also drowning in a sea of colleges. Where do I want to go? What do I want to do? I'm pretty sure I want to be a graphic designer but I don't know _where_ I want to go, how much it will cost or anything. I almost want someone to sit down with me and tell me where to go, it would make everything much easier and less confusing. I guess that means I'm kinda dumb and very lazy. I don't know where to even start looking Gah! Can't I just be a starving artist? I'll roam around from state to state beg for food and create pieces of art from random things lying around and I'll be carefree and happy until I get hit by a car :)"

My stupid moron of a chem teacher I _WILL_ complain about however. I, the amazing ""A"" student in chem that I am, was drawing in class today after I finished my work. My teacher flipped out and threatened me with detention. I was all WTF? I completed my work, understand what is going on but you are going to flip out at me for drawing in class? I think she should have found someone else to flip out on, perhaps the girl sitting across from me that slipped vodka in her water bottle and was getting drunk in the middle of class? Dur. Dur. Dur.
That's about it I think, things have been  a bit uneventful around here. Except for the whole Arielle and my BF thing but I'll save that for another time when I'm feeling less crappy."

Because he came over I got nothing done because we played video games all day. I feel like such a lazy bum.
I finally got to mess around with my new acrylic paint set on saturday and I was really impressed with them, I love them so much more than my watercolors. I'm almost finished my first canvas and when I'm off of the computer I'm probably going to finish it. And watch Grease because I have been in the mood to watch it lately for some reason.

"event","I keep getting annoyed at people today. Mainly my mom who is trying to shove her newfound religion down my throat. I would rant about it but I already did that else where. She also discovered a new item to push onto people. Like religion my mother goes through phases of selling things. She used to sell tupperware, stupid and pointless baskets, makeup and whatever else. Now she's selling these scrap book kinda things from this company called Heritage Makers. She dragged all of our photos ever taken and started scanning them onto the computer to make her scrap book online. Most of these pictures involve me and I swear she is _trying_ to find the ones I look most terrible in. My mother has this terrible knack of getting pictures of people when they look most unbecoming. Who cares if you have food still in your mouth? She'll take that stupid picture and put it on her wall.
The laptop is annoying me because some of the keys aren't working. And Deviantart is working abnormally slow and I couldn't post some of my pics last night. Merg!

Now for the good things :)
I got to go to hottopic today (finally) didn't get to buy the purse I wanted but I did get a hello kitty tote and a new gir shirt. I really wanted a corset but my dad would burn it if I came home with it. He isn't into anything that looks halfway ""goth"". It's uber annoying, he stereo types people all the time if they look ""goth"" he thinks that they are trouble makers. Sometimes it's all I can do to keep from rolling my eyes. I think if he ever knew some of the people I hang around he would have a heart attack."

"event","So, today my chem teacher was finally in school, not that she was of much help she didn't give us any review at all for our midterm tomorrow, she kind of waved to us and told us to study our review packets. I swear I could be a better teacher than she can. That woman needs to die, (ok not _die_ die is a strong word maybe she could quietly dissapear underneath someone's front porch)
Anywho, I am expecting to be grounded soon for my *gasp* horrible report card grade in Algebra, an 86% (which isn't that bad, my dad just thinks it is) because my Algebra teacher (who I have had for two years) is a moron. All of my other teachers are fine. I just hate (very strongly dislike?) two of them.
Tomorrow I can sit in on the Drama club practice thingie for the musical even though I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it anymore but my ""friend"" threatened to handcuff me and drag me there. The handcuffing part I don't mind but by my friend? Why not Johnny Depp? He can kidnap me too if he wants but only if he's wearing eyeliner ^.^ I'm just that pathetic.
I don't know why but eyeliner reminds me of when we went to the mall on my step mom's birthday and I swung by the jewlry display stand to look at the eyebrow rings and my dad comes up behind me and asks what I want to get pierced. I tried to be very vague and was all ""oh maybe just my ears"" but he called me out on it and told me I wasn't allowed to pierce my eyebrow or anything else until I move out of the house and I have to take out my piercing when I visit because he doesn't want a freak living there I guess. So there goes my plans of getting my eyebrow, tounge, lips and everything else done.
Whateves. Don't feel like writting more, it's anime time ^.^"

"event","My step mom's birthday was today, she decided that she wanted a love seat for the living room. I couldn't help but think what a lame birthday gift, I know that sounds horrible but out of all the things you could want and you want a couch? I don't want furniture for my house. Maybe a couple of chairs for my apartment when I'm out. Not having furniture would give me an excuse to come home and eat my parents food, I'm a horrible cook you see. Have to plan ahead :)
So anyway we went out for dinner (mexican food) and went to the store (a series of several malls) I came prepared with a book in hand and read the whole time while my family ran around like nuts looking for the perfect couch. Then they started looking at the matresses and kept laying down on them which totally grossed me out, how do you know if the last person who laid ther had lice or not? **shudders**
After all that shopping (we didn't buy anything, the day was kind of a waste but whatever) we came home and ate icecream cake. My step sister was being a pain all day and everyone was ticked off at her and she makes this off hand comment about how she always wanted to stick her face in a cake the next thing you know her head is squashed in the cake because my dad shoved her in. Almost PMSL it was great, I took pictures I totally plan on black mailing her later, I'm feeling a little evil right now. I already sent the pics to my friends through email."

It was an almond cluster or called something like that anyway. There were only four of them in the whole box. There was only one left for me. It was crap man! The rest of the chocolate didn't even deserve to be called chocolate. Chocolate rant complete!

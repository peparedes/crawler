"event","I'll admit, after a holiday season of explaining video games to guest at work I'm pretty tired of social interaction with people that don't know about the things their buying.&nbsp; 

Seriously Nintendo... why did you make the Wiimote and Nun-chuck sold separately and so confusing to non-gamers? If I had a nickle for every time I had to explain them I'd buy the Moon and bring it down on you guys! &nbsp; 

Anyway getting back to my story I was pretty tired of people, and tonight I had a guest that had just picked up a PSP for himself and was asking a bunch of questions. Yeah, I know it was new to him, but as I said, I was tired of these sorts of questions, but I'm on the job so I'm polite and answer everything I can. I just hate him a little more inside each time.&nbsp;

Then he comes up to me with a pinball game and asks me about something I don't know. So we read the back of the case. Turns out that according to the back of the game there are some actual old pinball game boards on the game. And his face lights up. That look of someone that's found something that's pure gold if only to them. And that made me smile right back. 

I might still not know much about pinball, but I know that look and it's nice to be reminded we all have our thing.

This holiday season has been made of the suck. It really has.&nbsp; 
I'm at a store I don't really care about that only has a handful of employees that I like. The guests here in Indy seem to be more rude and inpatient, and we're still not allowed to kill anyone as a warning.&nbsp; At this point I was pretty sure my heart was dead inside.&nbsp;

Then it happened.

I'm looking at the pile of gifts I've got set out for people. And in the analytical portion of my brain&nbsp; I ponder for a second just ow much I've spent.
But i can't. I look at the pile and just see the people I love and there's no price that could be put on that.

And I bow my head and realize that despite the horrors of the holiday season the good parts are still there and as strong as ever.

So I guess the moral of this is, despite how rough this time of year is, it's heart is in something good. Love your friend and family....

And wait till new years to strangle your enemies... at that point Santa's back to drinking and sleeping with elves and doesn't give a damn what you're doing.

And here I've spent the day making people that are so important to me cry.

"event","Years upon years ago, in the far away land of Muncie, I worn through a pair of sandals. And so I did like I had done every previous year and perchased a new pair, but this pair... this pair I was not prepared for. 

Picking the wrong size I found this pair was far too big and would slip off if&nbsp; I stepped wrong, or tried to run, or tried a kick something. Although the added projectile attack made the kick all the more effective...&nbsp; but being a guy I refused to return anything...&nbsp;I just figured I'd&nbsp;wear then until they died on me and get a new pair. After all... the others would last a year or so and then die...&nbsp;although this pair seem to&nbsp;not get that last part... they just wouldn't die. They were the Wolverine or James Bond of&nbsp;sandals. 

No matter what I did they just kept surviving! Day in, and day out. Walking all over campus, mowing, walking in and out of comic and toys stores. I even went on vacations in the&nbsp;things hopping that would spead along their demise.&nbsp; 

I put those damn things through their paces and they refused to give in. If anything it strengthened their resolve... although what sandals are doing with resolve is beyond me.&nbsp; 

So there I'd be walking along with my ill-fitting sandals explaining to friends and family I was just going to wear them till they died and that while I could just get rid of them I've got principles! And refuse to waste money on sandals that I could be wasting on comic books... like the Hulk! Oooo I can't wait to see the next issue. Who is Red Hulk? 

Anyway this continued on for years. To the point where I had just settle on living with them. They weren't budging, and neither was I.&nbsp; 

So I'm home working on some pictures throughout the day until I figure I need some sort of cooked meat and decide on a White Castle run. I head downstairs and to the door where I keep my sandals, but instead of finding them as usual I find their scattered remains. Seemingly torn to shreds... but how... was it one of the cats? What it my roommate Liz... or possibly the massive Golden Retriever I also live with... it just boggles the mind...&nbsp; 

But either way, the war has ended, and while I might not be able to take credit for the sandal's defeat, I can at least take pride in the knowledge that I outlasted them!"

"event","<p>Wii Fit is not only a jerk that calls me names, but it's also turning me into a monster!<br /><br />To start off after the initial testing it looks me over and says I'm overweight and have the balance of a 56 year old...&nbsp;<br />Then after I started crying to pointed and laughed then beat me up and stole my juice money... I wont even tell you want the thing did to my brother... I only hope Stu has the strength to carry on with his life... <br /><br />Not only that though, but when I started witht he training I decided to do something light, like the hoola-hoop game. So I play through and get the hang of it, and then pass it onto my neice since it's her turn.&nbsp; So right off the bat she wants to give the hoola-hoop game a try too, but when she starts it instead of the full hip rotaion needed she's just swaying back and forth. So Stu and I tell her she needs to move around on the balance board, but she's not getting it. So I slip behind her and put my hands on her hips and try moving her in a circle.<br /><br />I then sigh and look over at my brother&nbsp;and say 'Stu,&nbsp;am I one of those creepy touchy-feely uncles now?'<br /><br />He looks back and smirks,&nbsp;'Looks like it.'<br /><br />So see, Wii Fit is not only mean, but it also turns you into a bad uncle!<br /><br />-B!<br /><br />PS For thoughs that don't know I'm joking around with this, when given a chance Katie will climb me like I'm part of her&nbsp;jungle gym. So before anyone calls me out on this, she stared it! ;)&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>Carter Caves, one of my most favorite vacation spots on the Earth... And less than an hour there we go on a walk to the Fern Bridge, possibly my favorite spot in the park and while walking around a take a step on a slick rock, trying to avoid some mud. The next thing I know I'm landing full force on my hip... and I tell you there's nothing like a pain when you first start walking to remind a fellow just how much they like sitting around and drawing. ;)<br /><br />But all in all it was a fantastic vacation, got to see my family and hang out with my friend Dutch.

"event","<div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><span style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt"">This is a bit from a discusion on a message board of mine where a British friend was begrudging the fact that often in the cinema the villains are British, but I looked at it in a more possitive light:<br /><br />The stereotypical British person is a classy well versed and spoken man in a suit and top hat with interesting facial hair (where else in the world will you find mutton chops?) that'll be rather charming as he explains why he's going to crush all the governments and rule the world:<br /><br />""Soon my good man the device shall be complete, and then you'll understand the machinations of my intentions and why I shall control every man woman and child upon this Earth... excluding those that will be dead of course.

"event","<p>Is is common with Febuary, there's not a whole lot ot do in the toy store, especially in the electronics department.<br />The morning started out with me doing a little rearranging in the movies and the games, and then it looked like it was going to be another day of drawing things behind the counter... turns out fate would not be so kind!<br /><br />Instead I was to help sort out the expired candy. So traveled far from the saftey of the R-Zone booth (where we keep all the extra stuff), the the candy storage area... which actually didn't take long because it's the same room.&nbsp;<br /><br />From the I was set before a mountain of candies and told to toss the old candy, but first cut off the UPC code and put those away so we can turn them in for credit witht eh suppliers... sounds easy enough... but saddly I'm not a skilled man when it comes to box cutters. Which is probably why I cut open boxes with keys... pens, rulers, stray ducks, or whatever I can find.<br /><br />And since I realize this is a boring story I'll cut to the chase and say at least two of the fingers on my right hand are not bleeding... but at least I've learned that expired candy is out for blood!<br /><br />Don't let it expire! Buy it before it goes bad!<br /><br />-B!</p>"

"event","<p>Sadly, not a whole lot going on at the moment outside the normal. So lots of drawing and some playing Pokemon.<br />But I certainly don't mind the stabilty. Don't get me wrong.<br /><br />I find it a bit of a shame I didn't work on the Halo 3 release. I bet that must have been fun, but I did get to see my uncle and brother yesterday and have Pizza King. It was cute, at one point it was my uncle, myself, and my nephew at the table, which means we had the second born for three generations sitting there.<br /><br />Now I should get back to the art stuffs. I'm thinking I need a new big project to get the creative juices flowing.<br />Although I'll be hard pressed to top this thing: <a href=""http://www.supermegatopia.com/gallery/gallery.php?thisLink=furrycrossover.jpg"">http://www.supermegatopia.com/gallery/gallery.php?thisLink=furrycrossover.jpg</a><br /><br />-B!</p>"

"event","<p>So I'm visiting my brother this Sunday, and I'm just about to play on his Wii, when his dogs come in. Sam is... huge. At least half my weight and then some and Skippy, while smaller is not a small dog. And after some backing Skippy gets over the fear she has of all new people, then starts wanting attention.<br /><br />Sitting ont he couch I'm suddenly pushed back as Sam decides he wants to sit on my lap and Skippy qquickly comes in fromt he left side. Soon all I can see is black fur pressing into me. I reach an arm up and call to Stu for a little help and only he chuckles.<br /><br />I'm sure on the other end it was cute to see...<br /><br />...and I was able to get a minimate of Speed Racer and the Mach 5 for 1.57 at Toys'R'Us thanks to clerance, but discount card, and a coupon. Best Sunday I've had in ages! Woot!<br /><br />And for those that don't know, minimates are my little addiction.&nbsp;<br />Here's some of the Avengers in Minimate form:&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://actionfigureinsider.com/main/wp-content/uploads/Minimates16.jpg"">http://actionfigureinsider.com/main/wp-content/uploads/Minimates16.jpg</a><br /><br />I don't count them, otherwise I'd have an idea how much I've spent on them...<br /><br />Laters!<br /><br />B!</p>"

But I got my pages done and the new They Might Be Giants CD.

I will take what victories I can get!

...also if you have a chance to play Raving Rabids do it! The game is wacked, but a lot of fun.
Turns out I can milk a video game cow and ride a warthog... but not at the same time.

Anyway I'm trying to decide if I need to&nbsp;turn my card game idea into a board game... but I just don't know... Unfortunatly I'm not good any game mechanics and hwile my brother is pretty good, he's got plenty of his own distractions with his brood.

But on the bright side my neice kicks some serious ass on Legend of Zelda, and for that I'm proud of her!

But with luck it's the start of a series that'll see print next year.
I've got three pages down. Or at least almost down. I must&nbsp;scan and do a little editing, then ship them off to my&nbsp;brother so&nbsp;he can add the text.

With luck the finished work will go over well.&nbsp;Only three pages in and I've already&nbsp;drawn a massive demon.. Some robots. A team of adventurers, and a&nbsp;poisonous cup of tea. Not&nbsp;a bad start I'd say.

"event","<font size=""1"">This is going to be my little talky talky after so long.<br />It's going to involve Richard, tennis, and burgers.<br />Basically just a shit load of randomness.<br /><br />So Thursday, me and Dally went to the library to get some books and whatnot.<br />We came back and passed Wing Park, after we got a little gas we went back to Wing Park to see who was over there.<br />Of course, it was the <em>asians.</em><br />So we stayed and talked and played a little tennis in sandals and barefeet and Richard pops out of nowhere and yes.<br />He told us to come back tomorrow.<br /><br />Friday, I was afriad Dally wouldn't be able to come because she came home late and her dad was mad.<br />So I told Richard that I might not go because Dally wasn't going.&nbsp; But he told me to go.&nbsp; So...*shrug*<br />We told Selwyn to come along as well.<br />After school, we had practice then I went home, showered, and my dad told me to drop him off at NJ. Tech to get the truck.&nbsp; So I drop him off and truck all the way over to Wing Park.<br />The asians were there agian, but Richard wasn't.&nbsp; So I sat and watched everyone play.<br />Kirk didn't recgonize me at first.<br />:|<br />After a while Selwyn and Andy show up and we wait for a court to open, then Richard shows up and we wait a little more.<br />Finally a court opened up and we rallyed.<br />Richard popped my other racket's strings and he felt really really bad about it.&nbsp; Haha, so he said he would string it.&nbsp; We talked for a while and then played some more.<br />At 2130 the lights shut off after we were rallying.<br />We were all like, ""SHIT!&nbsp; WE FORGOT WHAT TIME IT WAS!"" And so I had to turn on my headlights.<br />I was giving Selwyn a ride home and we started heading to my car when he said my light was broken.<br />Richard said, ""You better fix that before you get pulled over some day.""<br />So I ran up and whacked it and...IT WORKED!&nbsp; Richard couldn't stop laughing.<br />Anyway, he said he would string my racket this weekend and his so we can play when he has his racket.&nbsp; So I told him to call me and gave him my number and so on and so forth.<br />I went to drop Selwyn off and started heading back home and I almost got lost...;_;<br />And then I almost ran into a bush...<br />:|<br /><br />Saturday, I slept for most of the day.<br />It was beastly.<br /><br />Today I had to pick up my dad from work, then we went to Algonquin commons and shopped around.&nbsp; I got a black shirt from Gap.<br />\o/<br />We stopped by a bar and grill place and got some REALLY REALLY good burgers.&nbsp; They were like...the size of my face.<br />Came home, went to go pick up my dad's meds from Jewel, stopped by Wing Park just for the hell of it.<br />And now I'm ready to finish my face sized burger.<br /><br />asian<br /></font>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""intuitive entry here so beware of my ramblings:"">

so ive been doing a lot of thinking lately, had a lot of time for my mind to run wild since my job requires no real thought process.....im just feeling weird....nervous about a lot of things....i need to get a better job, but thats not even where my thought process has been going...i worry sometimes that im losing sight of goals i have, gettin swept away by laziness even....i worry that im losing touch with my surroundings, i don't know where i'm going anymore.....i look back on myself and think of all these rules i had for myself...about how i wanted to have my loans paid off for the most part b4 i get married, and how i dont want to get married until im financially stable on my own....its killing me being back in this house after having escaped for 4 years of college, only visiting summers and holidays....

another really big worry i've been having lately is that im jumping so far ahead of myself, making all these little plans in my mind, and i fear im setting myself up for a huge letdown and that scares me.....i worry that im coming up short in life, not understanding where im going, that im lacking experience in making decisions.....i've been with david for 2.5 years now, and i cant say its been the best 2.5 years of my life because we've hurt each other during arguements, said things later regreted, its been rough but i love him so much and the times when we werent fighting were great, but i'm afraid we're losing sight of each other being apart physically now....i saw him the other weekend because i snuck away to see him in between our homes, otherwise i hadnt seen him since jen and rich's wedding august 9th.....we talk a lot when we manage to catch each other....i'm dead tired by the time i get in from my night class, he works during the day on the weekends and goes out w/ his friends at night (which im not complaining about at all, i want him to have friends, i dont want to come in between him and his friends ever) or else im out at night...

i dont want things to go south with him, but im still so worried about things with him....things have been good, but always in the back of my mind i wonder if things are good because we dont see each other much so we dont get on each other's nerves as easily.....i mean when i saw him last weekend we really kissed for the first time since graduation back in may, and b4 that it was even longer....

i really think im still guarding myself a lot and very cautious.....right b4 graduation in the last few months of school we broke up twice in 2 weeks time, at which point i felt like my life had ended and my heart had been ripped out, especially the second time he broke up with me, because that was just like the worst feeling ever, i had trusted him again and i felt like it had been thrown back at me....ugh.....

this is hard for me, i guess i worry too much, but i think this is the only way for me to express my concerns....i love him so much, and i feel like ive suddenly lit a fire under his ass in terms of marriage or proposing....and i shouldnt have because im not ready, the more i look inside i realize how much i need to grow and change, i have a lot of goals i need to achieve b4 i can go into that part of my life.....i have a lot of internal issues i need to deal with as well, that no one but me can deal with....

some of my goals include:
<ol>
<li> losing a lot of weight, im so not happy with myself right now, i hate the way i look, i want to lose all this stupid fat that i shouldnt have....i want to be skinny when i get married, i want my husband to be able to carry me out of the reception or across the threshold of our house....the way i am right now that wont happen, im not huge or even close to huge, but im not at an ideal weight (and i mean medical ideal, not mental ideal) </li>
<li> getting a better job, getting a better degree </li>
<li> finding happiness within, finding inner peace with myself, settling myself down and accepting things </li>
<li> paying off my student loans, establishing myself as my own person </li>
</ol>
yeah theres more but im tired and dont feel like spilling anymore of my soul out tonight"

"event","i swear to god my life would have been so much better if i had never been born or if i had just simply ran away or something.....i cant stand living in this house....my parents should never have gotten married to begin w/, both have the mentality and maturity of 3 year olds, they can't ever get along for more then 3 minutes....they don't speak to each other, when they do its yelling and arguing....every memory of any event in my childhood consists of them fighting and arguing....is it any wonder why im so scared to get married? i dont know how to have a happy life, my life has sucked since the day i came into it....i wasnt wanted, no matter what my mom says about how i wasnt planned but she still wanted me....i say bullshit, i should have been given up when i was born maybe then they'd be happy.....i so wish i had some place to leave to....i wish i could quit my job, and leave the area, get in my car and drive away, not leave any forwarding address, take what i want to take and leave it at that.....maybe the reason i have been thinking so much lately about marriage is i see it as an escape, a way out of this house, and maybe i hope whoever i marry will love me and that even when we fight, we'll get past it and not hate each other.....god i dont know anything anymore....my mom keeps saying she wants to get a job, and i tried 3 times in a row to tell her to apply through a temp agency, and 3 times she said what, cuz there was noise around her and i wasnt facing her when i was talking....so i told her what i said a 4th time but i said you need to be able to hear to have a job....she got mad cuz ididnt want to go w/ her around the corner to drop off some of her stupid marykay fucking shit that i think is retarded, so then she was mumbling about something and i said i dont know what ur mumbling but do whatever you want....she got mad and took off when i got out of the car, but hell im to the point where if i had the money, id be gone so fast and never look back.....i so wish i had one memory in my childhood that everyone was content and not fighting and being asswipes....my parents fought at my high school graduation, they fought at my college graduation.....i told my mom b4 she should leave, when she doesnt piss me off, ive told her id give up grad school and work full time to help pay bills for a place to live besides here, because this house isnt a home, its a building filled w/ hate and disgust....is it any wonder why my sister ran as soon as she could, and any reason why my brother would bend over backwards to avoid coming back here.....i hate that i dont get to leave this year and go back away to my own world away from here....."

"event","well i did it, i used up another lj code to make this new journal for myself for my confusing times in my life...i have old ones that i could have revamped but i chose to activate a new free one...as i was ranting over in my regular journal, im fustrated with dave.....the thing that kills me the most is that he lies to me to get me to shut up or stop asking about something i want to do....i was buggin him about goin to a dashboard confessional concert here in philly now that i know i can actually go to this show and now hes dragging his feet wanting to know if anyone else is playin the show....i hate that, if he doesnt want to go, fine say so but stop making me get my hopes up.....this is what happened countless times before, he makes promises he cant or doesnt want to keep....im really nervous about making reservations for salem in october for fear of him backing out last minute and jessalyn bailing because of something she cant get out of....and i dont know how much dave thinks im contributing towards the trip, im willing to let the hotel room price be split 3 ways, and buy my own like snacks or small souviners, but im not planning on having to pay for everything for myself, cuz even w/ saving thats going to be difficult with the things i want to buy between now and then.....*bangs head against wall* i dont understand myself half the time and i dont know what to do....he got me so upset the other day when i was at work that i was sitting at my desk crying silently because he just had me fustrated.....i didnt think id be able to make the dashboard confessional concert in philly because i have classes on the nights they are playin so i made the suggestion of goin to DC on the sunday they are playin there and because he was tired of discussing it, he said we'll see and then tells me when hes on the phone w/ me when im at work that hes goin to a yankees game that day instead and that he never intended to go to DC, he just said maybe to shut me up....and i dont know that hurts more then anything else, im not a child, dont try to pacify me.....i need alcohol, tomorrow night will do me good, getting good and drunk at the bar will serve a good purpose.....i just hope jessalyn doesnt end up bailing on me or i might very well end up doing it alone.....cuz i need to get out....all i know is david needs to get a sense of humor back really quickly or things are going to go straight downhill to points worse then we've been before....i cant be w/ someone who doesnt have a sense of humor, thats a big part of me, i hide behind jokes and a sense of humor..... this sounds off the wall but i sit here and wonder sometimes what my purpose on this earth is, why was i put here, what am i supposed to do, what is my goal here.....if i could have direction id do so much better....."

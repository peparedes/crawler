"event","&nbsp;Okay well let me just tell you a few things that happened yesterday.

&nbsp;First, it was another regular day at school but afterwards my mom and I took the subway down to Bay and went to the Indigo there. I bought the latest Teen Vogue with Mischa Barton on the cover (I LOVE HER) and also this book called ""Loving Will Shakespeare"" which is about his wife, Anne Hathaway. So, anyways I realised the Film Festival's in town so my mom and I were talking about seeing certain stars and getting a job at Indigo when we saw this red carpet and the street blocked off.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Well, my mom and I are naturally curious so we stopped and went to go see what was going on. Lo and behold we see a BIG sign saying, ""Twenty8Twelve by S. Miller""&nbsp;

&nbsp;Yes, that would be Sienna Miller. Well, then we just HAD to wait around for three hours (standing....I've got the sore thighs to prove it &gt;&lt;)&nbsp;There was two people on stilts and fire eaters and jugglers, like at a circus. They were really talented.&nbsp;Well, around 9:30, her limo pulled up and there she is....Sienna Miller in person. It was so COOL!

&nbsp;She was wearing black, skinny jeans with this incredibly high heels, a white blouse and a top hat. She had this really tall blonde lady in a black cocktail dress with her. She flashed us a smile and then went to give the paparazzi their photographs and was interviewed. More people started arriving&nbsp;but I didn't recognise any of them.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Closer to ten, she comes over to say hi to all the people who waited. She waved and gave us a closer look, she's pretty and thin and really short. I was taller than her and she was wearing three inch heels. But she didn't sign autographs and she didn't really talk with any of the fans. Which I thought was kinda rude but what're you gonna do?

&nbsp;And that's the most exciting thing that's happened to me this month, of course the month is just beginning so who knows who I'll meet next? Maybe Jared Padalecki ^_-"

"event","Oh. My. Giddy. God.

I'm in love with Seth Cohen from the OC. How the hell did this happen?????????

&nbsp;Well, really it's because I was bored and watched an episode of the OC where Seth makes an X-Men reference.&nbsp;Yuuuup, that's probably what started it. But I was also in love&nbsp;with Adam Brody too....

Hmmmmmm....all I know is&nbsp;I've started watching the OC and I love it. It's weird, in this totally bizarre way because I refused to watch it before but&nbsp;now it's Laguna Beach I refuse to watch.


Oh God, this better not mean that one day I'll actually like Laguna Beach, does it? *shivers*




AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;"

Not to steal Eleniel's idea but this is just because someone who's very special to me, her birthday is today.&nbsp;<br /><br />HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHARLIE SHEEN! I'm sure you know him from Two and a Half Men, if not...watch the show. It's so FUNNY! He turns 42 today!<br /><br />HAPPY BIRTHDAY GARRETT HEDLUND! He turns 23 and played Jack Mercer in the action movie Four Brothers and Murtagh in the disaster movie Eragon.&nbsp;xD<br /><br />HAPPY BIRTHDAY CLARE KRAMER!

"event","<p>&nbsp;Well so Eleniel gave me a letter and it's N. Fuck, this is gonna be hard. I'll try to think of ten things. But if not, oh well..<br /><br />1. Nick Holte (I don't actually know who he is but I got it from Supernatural ^ ^ Gotta love Dean)<br />2. Nat Black (it's ME! Or rather my mary-sue! Teehee!)<br />3. Narnia (because i've been reading the Chronicles of Narnia books. I'm on Horse and His Boy ^_^)<br />4. Naruto (i know it's a crappy ninja anime but Sakura is so FUNNY! ^ ^)<br />5. Nala (from the Lion King. I LOVE DISNEY! wooT!)<br />6. Neverland (Peter Pan was my favourite story as a child, besides Little Mermaid. I always wanted to go to Neverland and I don't mean Micheal Jackson's pedophile park)<br />7. Nyx (Goddess of the Night. She's a character in this book I'm reading called Marked)<br />8. Natasha Bedingfield (I have her CD and love her songs! The lyrics read like a poem ^ ^)<br />9.&nbsp;Noob (in honour of my friend the Noobsauce Fairy)<br />10. Nerds (because they are a yummy candy and also in one of the greatest movies of all times: Revenge of the Nerds.)<br /><br /><br /><br />Wow, that was fun..... We should definitely do this again sometime. <br /><br /></p><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/00004sp9/""></a>"

"event","&nbsp;Well here are the promised Drusilla icons. They aren't that great, mostly because I don't have Photoshop or Paintshop Pro so I did them all on regular paint. I'll keep on practicing and maybe someday they won't look as bad.<br /><br />^_^<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/0000112z/""><img height=""100"" alt="""" width=""100"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/0000112z"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/000025r0/""><img height=""100"" alt="""" width=""100"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/000025r0"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/000032ff/""><img height=""100"" alt="""" width=""99"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nat_black/pic/000032ff"" /></a>"

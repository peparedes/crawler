"event","I am having one of those nights where I dont know if I want to cry or dance.  My heart feels like it wants to explode and I don't know why.  When my mood typically gets like this I drive up to Red Rock and look out over the expanse of desert and realize just how small I am.  I can't do that right now though, because it is 9pm and Red Rock is dark and closed.  I hate this feeling."

"event","My dad just told me that they may be taking my brother on a cruise or a trip to Hawaii this summer while I am in Japan.  I know I will be having an amazing summer of freedom and individual growth, but a part of me still hurts.  In a way it feels like I am being cut out of the family.  We have not done a family vacation for several years and now that my parents are planning one, it seems like I am not invited.  My dad cited that he will be giving me money towards my trip, however I am not asking for that money.  My plans are to survive this summer on my own money.  So while I am surviving on dollar store ramen, my family will be eating at expensive restaurants.  I, in no way, want this to sound like I am ungrateful for the opportunities granted to me or that I don't want to go to Japan (because I am TOTALLY stoked).  It just hurts inside of my heart that they are doing this trip without me.  It also feels like my brother is being rewarded for not having a job and not graduating from college.  
Now I really have to go finish getting ready for work."

Stability results were high which suggests you are very relaxed, calm, secure, and optimistic..

Orderliness results were low which suggests you are overly flexible, improvised, and fun seeking at the expense too often of reliability, work ethic, and long term accomplishment.

Extraversion results were moderately low which suggests you are reclusive, quiet, unassertive, and secretive.

trait snapshot:
messy, tough, disorganized, fearless, not rule conscious, likes the unknown, rarely worries, rash, attracted to the counter culture, rarely irritated, positive, resilient, abstract, not a perfectionist, risk taker, strange, weird, self reliant, leisurely, dangerous, anti-authority, trusting, optimistic, positive, thrill seeker, likes bizarre things, sarcastic"

"event","So IACE is running this incredible special on airfare and that means I can get to Japan for suuuuuuper cheap \(^o^)/ Like $299 plus tax and fuel cheap!  Unbelievable right?  I just have to purchase the tickets this Saturday and leave by 5/15.  Only thing is that I have absolutely no leave time saved up at work and I haven't spoken to my manager about taking the time off.  The last thing I want to do is have to quit my job for a vacation.  I would be hired back, but possibly at much lower pay.  

But other then the job thing everything works out.  My uni classes are finished by 5/11.  I have the money for the plane ticket right now.  I have several possibilities for roommates (and a friend working for the apartment company!  Love you Jen <3 )  

Not to mention TEGOMASU 2nd Live going on!!!  I need to go again!  The first one was sooooooooo cute XD   

So my plan right now is to talk to my manager tomorrow, buy the ticket either on Thursday or Saturday, then fly to Japan on 5/15 and stay until the end of June.  I really like this plan!  Plus with the money saved on airfare I will definitely be able to afford a Rail Pass and actually get to Osaka, Kyoto, and so many other places!  

I feel like my summer plans were just put into place :)  Will be completely devastated if I cant get the time off from work T_T"

"event","Ok so today went fairly well.  I woke up, went downstairs to visit with my relatives before they left, then took the medicine for my shoulder, and kinda fell back to sleep.  I didn't mean to sleep until 2:30, but the muscle relaxer makes me pass out if I don't fight it enough.  After getting up again I grabbed lunch, skipped my afternoon pills because I had to drive all the way to Henderson, big mistake!  By the end of Korean I could feel my muscles bunching back up and dull pain.  By the time I got home all I wanted was to ice my shoulder, watch a little TV, and then go to bed.  

I grabbed the ice and a cookie, a single cookie.  Then I sat down to watch Heros with my dad.  We were kindly waiting for my mom to come down to start the show and I begin munching away on the cookie, taking small nibbles to make it last longer.  As soon as my mom came around the corner and sees me she yells, ""WHY ARE YOU EATING THAT!? DO YOU WANT TO GET FAT!""  Come on, it is one little cookie!  Its not like I was cuddling up with a pint of Ben and Jerrys.  I responded to her that it was just one cookie and that I didn't appreciate being attacked about it.  She yells back that I have to have gained 10 pounds since getting back from Japan, which I haven't, only 1.5 pounds.  She went off about a bunch of medical stuff, mostly things that have nothing to do with me.  

I tried to go upstairs to avoid further fighting, but then both of my parents started yelling at me about being a brat.  They said I need to have an attitude adjustment.  I was the one trying to avoid a fight, how is that needing an attitude adjustment?  So amid them screaming threats I went up to my room.  After 5 minutes I went back down to try and sooth things out, it didnt work.  Within 30 seconds I was being screamed at again.  

My mom brings up that on Saturday, when we were out with family, I ate a truffle, Mexican food for lunch, and a steak for dinner.  I was stupid enough to shot back that I only had one enchilada for lunch with water to drink and that she had an enchilada, rice, beans and a soda and also had a truffle and a steak for dinner.  And who was the one making the bad choices?   She was not happy with me.  

She wants to know why I cant be as healthy and actively losing weight like I did in Japan.  I could only stare at her.  The answer is so obvious.  It is because I am not in Japan.  I can't walk to the station to catch my train.  It is a completely different lifestyle here, one that I dont like.  It is easier to be healthy when you are happy, I am not happy in Las Vegas.  I miss Tokyo.  I miss wondering in Koenji.  I miss dinner at Grazie Gardens.  I miss the smell, the feel, the press of people.  I miss finding other people who even know what TV show I am talking about.  I miss walking down the street and seeing something new everyday.  I miss the constant hum of activity.  I miss rain and only seeing glimpses of the sky between the buildings.  I miss being able to just be myself, knowing that I can get away with more because I don't have the confines of my social norms to stop me.  I miss being happy."

One car was broken into and the registration with their address and the clicker to get into their neighborhood was stolen.  Soon after that a car was STOLEN from the parking lot.  How crazy is that?!  I am thinking that I will be leaving nothing in my car for the foreseeable future."

"event","Been back for one full weekend. The only good thing so far is the ability to go for days without spending any money. Finally had to buy a parking permit and notebooks today.  Besides that I have been very good.  Tokyo made me spend, Las Vegas turns me very cheap.  Still I wish I was in Tokyo.  To have been able to stay up for 24 hours with NEWS would have been tiring, but enjoyable.  
It was turning to fall in Japan, even leaves were getting the first hints of red.  Here it is hot.  Way too hot.  Smoke fills the sky from the California wild fires.  Fall is at least a month away.  
None of my clothes fit.  I love that I lost weight, but I can't afford new clothes right now.  I have to order at least one pair of jeans.  Every pair of pants I have practically fall off if I don't have a belt on.  
Something crawled into the attic space above my room and died recently.  It smells horrible.  Hopefully the pest guy can come out today to take care of it or else I will be sleeping on the couch tonight.  My mom kept saying that she smelt something, but I was always to tired to notice.  This morning I opened my clothes to find something to wear and about passed out from the smell.  I slammed the door shut and decided to get dressed from the still damp clothes in the laundry room.  I hate whatever creature it is that decided to die in there. 
Classes have officially started. Anthropology this morning, Korean tonight.  Japanese tomorrow.  
I get freaked out by people here now.  They are too eager to talk.  Just had some strange lady ask me about the laptop that I am using.  She wanted to tell me all about her brand new Sony laptop... do I care?  Got a new phone yesterday.  The guy at Verizon annoyed the hell out of me.  What happened to the Japanese way of getting things done and only talking if you start the conversation. This guy kept making stupid jokes and wouldn't shut up.  I kinda wanted to punch him.  My mom thought I was annoyed with her, which I was, but I was mostly annoyed with the stupid sales guy.  
Then my mom insisted that I get a manicure/ pedicure.  I tried to tell her no, but I didn't try to hard.  I wish I had.  The lady was so rude.  I know some of my annoyance should have been expected.  Everyone there always speaks Vietnamese to each other, but the lady giving me my manicure went too far.  In the middle of it her phone rang and she actually answered it, then proceeded to talk on it for 5 minutes.  A little talking between co-workers I can understand, but talking on the phone and ignoring your paying customer is going too far!  Plus I bring my own tools for health safety reasons.  All of these tools were purchased at this nail salon and have been used there before.  They lady said my cuticle cutters wouldn't work, and then said that my foot razor wasn't working either.  I happen to know that both of those things work just fine.  I told her so and she kept insisting that they didn't work.  I think she was just having issues.  I never plan to go back to that place again.  
Sorry about that rant, she just really pissed me off.  

Can't wait for Korean tonight.  I just wish Shawna was still taking the class with us, with out her we just aren't the Super Tomodachi."

First Yamapi

Second Kato Kazuki

Now  Koyama Keichiro



J and I went to karaoke today and just as we were leaving Koyama and a group of three were signing up to go in.  As soon as we turned the corner to approach the desk both of our eyes focused on Kei-chan.  He has an amazing presence about him.  It didn't even process in either of our minds that it was Koyama until after we left the karaoke building.  We were just like, 'wow, that guy is so cool.  He looks like Koyama.'  Once we were out of the building and around the corner it actually processed, ""OMG that was Koyama!!""  It wasn't until we were served our curry that we realized he would be in that building for a while longer.  We ate in a hurry and rushed back to see if we could catch him on the way out.  Kristi joined us.  But sadly we did not get to see him again."

Today we went to Shibuya and actually managed to find phones with e-mail so e-mail me anytime at tzsiga@softbank.ne.jp  With my computer down I will most definitely be able to reply faster there.  After our phones we went to karaoke.  It was a lot more fun then I thought it would be.  I just have to work on memorizing some more songs.  This evening we went to see a live perforce by Jenny's bassist and guitarist.  It was really good,  We ended up getting rained on, but did manage to buy a couple of little plants.  Super cute.  Came home, had dinner, and was ready for a relaxing night when Popstar called us over to his place to play with hair and make-up.  After he and Harmony prettified everyone we decided not to waste their hard work and got really dressed up to go with it and walked down to Mr. Donuts.  Unfortunately they closed just as we got there, so we went to the AMPM instead.  Made quite a few heads turn in our dresses.  

Amazing first week continues.  Kristi managed to snag herself a ticket to go watch the filming of a tv program featuring Koyama and TegoMassu.  Lucky girl, more then a little sad that there was only one ticket.  Since it is Massu I decided to give her the heads-up about it while Chris was styling her hair.  So exciting, less then one week and being able to see more then half of NEWS."

"event","Had an exciting day today.  Woke up just after 6 and ate pancakes, really wish I had syrup.  Hung around the apartment for a while and did a load of laundry.  At 9 went to the other apartment to see if anyone was moving.  Kristi and I gathered Jenny into our group and traveled back to the Shinjuku City Office because she forgot her passport yesterday for the foreign registration card.  After that we walked around a little bit then hurried to Yoyogi Park's small gym.  One of the members of our favorite group was filming a television drama about basketball there and they needed extras to be fans.  It was a long shot, but we got in.  Were seated at the back at first, but soon moved to a different section and grabbed front row seats.  We were above the gym floor, but since we were in front we could go up to the rail and cheer.  We caught the attention of a team mascot and from a distance we all started joking around.  At one point I made eye contact with Yamapi (the guy we were there to see) and my heart did a summersault.  Since we love to goof-off Kristi and I began mimicing certain moves of members of the singing group that Yamapi is a member of.  He caught us doing one little move and then kept glancing back.  Then he caught us doing the deguchi man (the sign representing an exit, that the group likes to imitate) and he smiled and laughed a little, bobbing his head!  He is known for not showing any real expression and we made him laugh!!  After that for the rest of the night he kept glancing at us.  It was really amazing.  When it came time for the actors to leave everyone used the exit that we were sitting above.  Yamapi was the last one through and since we know he is trying to learn english we called out to him ""Come out to dinner with us!""  He, who is not know for speaking to anyone, stopped, looked directly at us and thanked us, into his micr ophone.  Everyone in the gym saw and heard him speak only to us!!  It was so amazing *_*  An old lady came up to us and asked what we said to make him speak to us.  We were too excited/shocked to respond properly.  Only three and a half days into my trip and the unimaginable has happened!  I spoke with one of the top idols in Japan!!!!"

There are no words able to fully describe the spectacular display of talent, creativity, and color on that stage.  From the moment the curtain went up I could feel my eyes twinkling like a five year old on Christmas morning.  I was enchanted by the display of costumes.  How anyone ever had the imagination to create those masterpieces I will never know.  I strongly recommend anyone who has the chance to see this wonderful production to go without a second thought.  It brings out the kid inside.  It sent me spiraling into my past when I was in the third grade and saw the Lion King for the first time, only know I could truly appreciate all of the hard work put into an amazing performance."

"event","I can't believe that in less then a week I will be in Tokyo.  It is so soon and I am hardly prepared.  I still have packing and cleaning and all sorts of things left to do.  Tomorrow I am meeting up with friends to review before Saturday's Kanji Kentai.  Thursday my brother is coming to visit.  Friday will be family day.  Saturday is the test, dinner, and The Lion King.  Then Sunday comes and everything needs to be finished by then.  Monday morning I will be boarding a plane.  I had so many more things that I wanted to get done this week that I fear are not going to happen.  
Today I did get the yen that I ordered yesterday.  It helps me feel more prepared for arriving in Tokyo that I have cash just in case.  It was shocking that it came so fast.  True it does say 1 to 3 business days, but I always expect 3 or 4.  That less then 24 hours later it was ready for pick up was a pleasant surprise.
Have to go work on getting things together now."

"event","I tried to post this last night and LJ crapped out on me, which did not make me any happier.  

I will start by apologizing for this rant. Today was just one of those days when the universe seems to throw up all over you.  I woke up and quickly checked my f-list and it was then that I saw the clip of Shingo's apology/statement concerning Tsuyoshi.  Seeing Shingo that emotional should have been a warning to crawl back into bed.  Alas I couldn't do that since I had work.  

I got there and finally got the chance to talk to my store manager about leaving for Japan.  Her response was that she would see if I could take a leave or 'I guess we will have to fire you, it doesn't really matter to me.'  I think she was joking about that, but with her it is hard to tell.  Plus she won't be the store manager when I return, so I have no idea what will happen.  After that conversation I found out that in addition to being the only person in adult (meaning covering the registers, fitting rooms, and assisting the customers on the floor), someone had not shown up for their markdown shift that morning so I had to do the markdowns as well.  Bridget had gotten most of them done already, but there was still the woman's sale wall which is the most time consuming section.  I was eagerly awaiting my second persons arrival, but it turned out he misread his schedule and thought that he was in at 12 instead of 11.  Not having back up for two hours on a Saturday is the worst.  At several points all 14 fitting rooms were in use and I had a line at the registers.  I felt like the proverbial chicken with its head cut off.  Sometimes I really wish I could clone myself.

My day started to get a little better once I got home.  I pretty much went straight to my room and fell asleep for three hours.  Only woke up because I was called down to dinner.  At that point my day slipped further into a dark hole.  To start with I want to say that I am home maybe once every two weeks for dinner.  Most of the time I am either in class, at work, or out with friends so I miss home cooked meals.  For once I was home today and my father knew it.  Typically he is nice and asks what I want to eat.  Today he didn't, but I saw spaghetti sauce thawing on the counter so I assumed that was what we were having, I was really looking forward to it.  I got an unpleasant surprise when I went downstairs and discovered chicken in a mushroom sauce.  I hate, absolutely HATE mushrooms, and my father knows this.  When I asked about the spaghetti sauce he said that they had eaten it for lunch and there"

"event","SO I was driving home from class today, trying not to fall asleep and wondering why I was so tired when I realized that I worked yesterday.  I was literally so tired that I forgot that monday actually existed.  Once I did remember, I got angry all over again.  Stupid people at stupid Gap, making me super angry!!!!! AFHJDAHGARHGURAHGJGHFHTEAUDKGHRUFJA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  First I get there and Angela is searching for something, announces that she doesn't know where Shane put it, and then leaves.  Not so much as a 'hi, today sucks, bye'  Donna told me to ring on register 8 and suddenly I realized that I was the only person working in adult for the rest of the day!  It is a piece of shit when I have to close adult and fold down the entire store by myself.  I HATE IT!!!! WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!  Looking around the floor I noticed that all of the men's mannequins had been changed.  Didn't really matter much.  Then I went back to the fitting rooms to find this mess of clothes waiting to be processed and put out.  Pissed me off even more.  So I started going through them and realized that they were almost all men's clothes, which is incredibly rare.  It didn't take long for me to figure out that the visual team had dumped all the clothes they had taken off the mannequins in my fitting rooms.  THIS IS NOT ALLOWED!!!!! Visual people are supposed to clean up and put away all the clothes for the mannequins.  They do that and the sales people take care of the customers.  It is a 'I don't bother you, you don't bother me' relationship.  So I told my manager about it and she got pissed too.  She was like 'Don't even tell me that, I don't think so!' in a very sarcastic angry way.  Apparently the visual people have been sending these really long e-mails that the sales associates are upkeeping the floor properly and doing all sorts of things wrong.  You try cleaning the entire floor in an hour and tell me how we are supposed to board fold everything as well!!  So apparently they like to bitch and then leave half of their work for those of us working the floor.  It would be one thing if this was the only time this happened, but they always leave the clothes for someone else to take care of.  It is soooooo annoying.  I would have had the floor done before we even closed if it hadn't been for all of those clothes!!!!!  At one point I was literally having a Lydia~esque tantrum in the middle of the store.  There were no customers at the time and I started hitting the wall and almost tearing apart clothing.  I wonder if anyone outside the store saw me and decided not to go shopping......that would be bad.  Anyway, because I am Superhuman Gap Girl (official title btw) I managed to get everything done with twenty minutes to spare (with the help of Mary and Sheila, they ROCK!!!!).  Got out early, but being that angry apparently makes me tired for two days.  Rant over."

"event","I don't want to go to work.  I don't want to deal with the stupid new policies that are now in place.  They took away our boxes, hid them in the back room somewhere.  They are gone until holiday.  With luck I will no longer be working there after this summer.  They now also want us to ask if the customer wants a bag for their purchase of if they want to carry it out.  Personally I think it is insane.  The few customers I asked looked at me like I had grown a couple extra heads, of course they want a bag!  
Today I broke on of my mom's new dishes.  We have had them for less then a week and CRASH broken into twenty pieces.  Oops!  Now I have to pay for the replacement and they are not cheap plates.  If she can get the same discount she used when buying them it will be $33, but if she can't its like $50 something.  :(  Why did I have to kill the plate?"

"event","So my brother came to visit yesterday and he has already pissed me off!!!!! The worst thing is that I have hardly seen him, maybe a total of an hour and a half spread across a day and a half.  Yesterday I came home from work and ate dinner with the whole family then I ran to the grocery store to get my dad some ice cream.  When I got back home I was attacked by a major migraine and went to bed.  Total time with brother maybe 30 minutes.  Today I woke up completely nauseous and spent almost the entire day locked in my room, I even had someone cover my shift at work because I was feeling so ill.  I ate a little dinner with the family then re-banished myself to my room.  Then just a little while ago I went downstairs to do a quick load of laundry and sat in the main room with my dad and brother. This is where things got dicey.  My brother started talking to me about movies and rumors of movies.  Movies are his thing, I really don't care that much.  Just to be nice since I don't see him often I went along with the conversation.  He then started talking about why Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince release date was changed.  I gave him my theory and he flat out said 'WRONG' I was like whatever, I am more a fan of the books then the movies and I really didn't care.  It was at this point that he started to challenge me on the books, THAT HE HAS NEVER EVEN READ!!!!!!!  He started asking me what the bathroom scene between Draco and Moaning Myrtle was about....like I wouldn't remember that scene.  When I went into detail about that scene (down to the name of the curse that Harry throws at Draco, the effect of that curse on Draco and the storyline, and where Harry learned the curse), he once again started to ask me questions about the movie and that particular part in the movie.  I have already told him that I am not keeping up on the movies.  He seems to think that this makes him the master of the argument, so then (thinking he is so amazing) he starts talking about the death on the set of Half Blood Prince.  At this point I am like wait a second, I may not be up on the newest press releases, but I have followed enough to know about the deaths and injuries.  No one died on set!  I told my brother this and he told me I was wrong.  I then informed him that Yes, an actor from the movie was killed, but not on set.  Robert Knox, who played Marcus Welby, was stabbed to death in a club fight while defending his younger brother.  On set, Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double was injured when an explosion went off two soon.  The man was temporarily paralyzed, but I think he is okay now.  I explained all this to my brother and that there was no death on the set itself.  He still insisted that there was a death on the set, so I asked him to go on-line and show me an article or press release about the death.  He refused.  At this point he was incredibly angry with me and actually asked me to leave the room...THE MAIN ROOM IN THE HOUSE!!!!  I, of course said no, and my brother continued to seethe.  After a couple more seconds he stood up and said 'If you won't leave, then I will.'  HE GAVE UP WATCHING THE LAST 30 SECONDS OF HIS BASKETBALL GAME JUST BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY WITH ME!!!!  Because he was being an overly emotional baby I told him to grow up.  He shot back that maybe I should try growing up and move out of my parents house and then stormed out of the room.  At this point my dad told me that I did nothing wrong and that my brother was really being a baby.  Then I came up here to write this.

OMG HE JUST BROUGHT ME A PAPER TO SUPPORT HIS SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT REALLY HAS NO IMPACT ON IT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     He brought me a hand written paper that is supposedly the press releases concerning the change in the release date.  WTF?  I thought we were arguing more about deaths on the set then the release date.  For all I know he made up the two sentence blurb, plus I really don't care.  I didn't ask for proof about the release date, I asked for proof about the death!!!  


BTW in more cheerful news my NEWS calender came today!!! YAY!!!  I love it, it is so pretty!!!  KYAAA Ryo's solo poster makes my heart go doki doki!!!!"

"event","Southern California was a blast.  The hotel was a bit on the scary side, but mostly ok.  Gas was actually cheaper there then here, no fair!!  I was a little sad that K got the only current issue of magazines, but I am happy with the one that I got (NEWS cafe photoshoot, YAY!!!) The beach was fun, I wish we'd had more time there, but oh well.  The weather was great and the water not to bad, made me wish I had worn my swimsuit. Unfortunately I seem to have picked up a cold at some point.  Saturday I woke up with a sore throat and by the end of the day it had developed into a case of the sneezes.  By Sunday I was miserable, but I put on a somewhat happy face and had a good time at the Huntington Library and Gardens.  The gardens were so pretty, I want to go back and spend more time there.  I would have liked to see more of the Chinese gardens, but L was getting tired and we were all hungry so it was time to go.  I will just have to go back one day and enjoy everything they have to offer.  We never hit much horrible traffic, pretty much all of it was expected to me.  It was always the other side of the freeway that was backed up.  There was even a white suburban engulfed in flames just outside of Vegas on the way back.
Today I have been feeling even worse then the last couple of days.  This morning Dr. R took pity on me during torture the students time because I looked so pitiful.  I came home and took a nap instead of working on a paper that is due tomorrow, so I need to finish that next.  I went to work at 4 and continued to be completely useless.  We had extra coverage so my manager kicked me out at 6:30.  Even though I feel like shit I had pasta for dinner, it was just too tempting....yum, yum, yum!!!
If anyone I went on vacation with get sick, I am soooooo sorry!!!!  I feel bad that I even exposed you to whatever this thing is.  Apparently it is running rampant at work and it is a real dozy that doesn't like to go away.  I am on lots of meds and none of them really seem to work that well, but I shall keep taking them to try to get rid of this thing.  The hardcore coughing started today and is absolutely miserable.  
Well have to go work on my paper now, night!"

"event","So I was having a pretty good day this morning.  I went to anthropology and it went well. I got my test back, I only got an 88 which didn't make me happy.  If I had done all of the extra credit questions I would have gotten an A, but I was tired that night and hadn't wanted to spend the extra hour or two writing those essays.  Dr. R did give us an extension on our final though, instead of being due next Thursday before noon, it is now due Friday before noon, woohoo!!  Looking the test over the extra day might be needed, wosh is it a doozy.  After class I went to I building to hang out until K got out of class.  I was planning to study kanji and grammer, but thought I would check lj quick.  That was a mistake!

The first post I say said something about supporting Ryo in these hard times and hoping everything turns out okay for him, not knowing what was going on I was like 'wtf?'  The post had a video of a news clip that talked about the accident.  Unfortunately since my Japanese skill are not that advanced yet all that I could really understand/ process was the Ryo was involved in a car accident and there was an injury.  I was completely spazzing at this point, all sorts of wretched scenarios playing out in my mind.  I am surprised no one else in the area commented on my odd behavior.  My entire body was shaking and tears gathered in my eyes.  Once I slightly calmed down I scrolled further down the page and found out that Ryo was not injured and I was kind of better.  It was still a shock to hear about and it made it hard to concentrate. So instead of wasting my time studying Kanji with a brain not focused on it, I worked on flashcards of vocabulary instead.  

Once K got out of lab we went to meet S and study Japanese.  By now I was more calm and able to mostly concentrate on what we were working on.  We finished reviewing the two chapters we are being tested on tomorrow, but I still don't feel that confident.  Hopefully a bit more studying will push me to greater belief in my ability.  

After we finished studying we decided to revisit a couple of stores in Chinatown that were closed the other night.  One of them had posters of some Korean boyband on its door that we made fun of before.  The one guy, Hero, had studs all over his jacket so we decided to call him Mr. Bead-dazzler.  Today K told me she had figured out who they are, Tong Vfang Xien Qi(TVXQ)/Dong Bang Shin Ki/Tohoshinki, it seems that they have multiple names.  I looked them up on You-tube and they seem to warrant further investigation.  I did decided that this video is love:
<lj-embed id=""5""/>

Depressingly I don't think I will be able to attend Japanese club tomorrow night.  I just have way too much stuff to get done before this weekend, including a paper due wednesday morning and another one due thursday morning.  Plus I have a ton of cleaning and stuff to get done before I go to California.  Those of you who go tell me what happens, k?

Plus I just found out that my Woman's Studies class is meeting at the outdoor amphitheatre tomorrow and it is going to be windy.  I bet I am going to freeze.  I also have absolutely no idea what we are going to do, the professor just said 'its going to be lots of fun!'  I don't want fun, I want to sit in class, nice and warm, and not pay attention. 

I guess I should go back to studying kanji now, I think I have made this post long enough for one day."

I just don't feel like dealing with anything...I mean absolutely anything...not even the energy to turn off my computer and light and go to sleep.  I think it all stems back to my anthro midterm that I do not have any desire to work on and it is due Wednesday by 9:30 am.  I am so screwed.  I know by the time I finish it, if I want an A or B, it needs to be at least 10 pages, preferably 15.  Stupid Dr. Rafferty and his take home essay tests.  Actually, typically I look forward to his tests, they take A LOT of work, but I also learn a ton while writing them.  Unfortunately this semester I am just not that into the topics/ my mind is not focusing on them properly.  For the most part I really don't care about the PreHistory of North American Natives, but some of the higher cultures are kind of cool.  The Hohokam and the Cave Dwelling Anasazi are rather complex (warfare, cannibalism, elaborate structures and tool traditions), but they are all in one section of the six section test.  Really, I don't give a damn about the development of culture in the Arctic.  I will change professions before I ever work there.  It is too damn cold and there are only like 2 months to get any work done.  It sucks ass up there.  No way.  

I guess I should get to sleep now, it looks like I won't get any tomorrow night.  Stupid test.  Stupid sleep.  Stupid need to graduate and get a good job."

"event","As always it has been forever/at least a week since my last post.  I have discovered that even though I am busy doing things almost everyday I still feel as though I have nothing to post about.  I guess I could bitch about my crappy presentation partner in my woman's study class and how much she sucked at speaking/ keeping an eye on the time so as not to go over the ten minutes we were allotted (which we did, wah!).  I thought I had failed my sociology exam, I left the class feeling like shit because of it, but I just checked and turns out I got an 'A'.  YAY!  

I think today was one of the first days since semester began that I have been home all day.  It was kind of nice not to do anything, but really weird at the same time.  I am so used to being gone all day that seeing my parents again felt weird.  Turns out I have missed some important things, like my dad is retiring in June!  I hope this doesn't hinder me going to Japan since he is helping with the monies.  

I think I did manage to freak my mom out a little bit tonight.  My dad was watching some golf tournament and there was a young Japanese guy competing.  He was really cute so naturally I was cheering for him and then I found out his name is Ryo and I kinda squealed a little.  It was at that point that my mom gave me the weirdest look and I ran away to my room."

"event","Wow, my life is boring! It seems like I never do anything interesting anymore.  I have been cooking a lot this weekend, which is odd for me. Typically when my parents go out of town I order a pizza and survive off of mac and cheese, but so for this week I have made Chicken Katsu, Yakisoba, tacos, and sloppy joes.  It is weird to look into the refrigerator and see leftovers of the stuff that I made.  
Yesterday's weather was crazy!  Around 9 I finally thought it was safe to go out last night to get some milk, but when I left the grocery store I found myself fogged in and being poured on!  I seriously thought I was going to die when I was driving home.  I swear at one point I couldn't see more then 15 or 20 feet in front of me, I actually watched as a car completely disappeared into the fog!  It was quite scary!  My phone even rang while I was driving, and even though it was easy enough to get to I refused to take my hands off the wheel to answer it.  I sweat those 10 minutes of driving were some of the scariest of my life!
But once I did get home I managed to set up my laptop with my TV and brought speakers down so I could have quality sound.  Since then I have been watching J Dramas on the big screen, which is AWESOME!!!  I am just sad that right now I don't really have anything with Ryo-chan in it to watch!  I want to see his beautiful face on a real TV!!! Sadly my dad comes home tomorrow so I will have to disconnect my little theater :(
My kitty is whining for water now so I got to go!  Night!"

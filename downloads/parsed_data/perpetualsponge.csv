"event","""They say that there's a broken heart for every light on Broadway.
They say that life's a game, then they take the board away.
They give you masks and costumes and an outline of the story
Then leave you all to improvise their vicious cabaret...

In no-longer-pretty cities there are fingers in kitties.
There are warrants, forms, and chitties and a jackboot on the stair.
Sex and death and human grime, in monochrome for one thin dime,
But at least the trains all run on time but they don't go anywhere.
Facing their Responsibilities either on their backs or on their knees
There are ladies who just simply freeze and dare not turn away
And the widows who refuse to cry will be dressed in garter and bow-tie
And be taught to kick their legs up high in this vicious cabaret.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The ballet on the burning stage.
The documentary see
Upon the fractured screen
The dreadful poem scrawled upon the crumpled page...

There's a policeman with an honest soul that has seen whose head is on the pole
And he grunts and fills his briar bowl with a feeling of unease.
But he briskly frisks the torn remains for a fingerprint or crimson stains
And endevours to ignore the chins that he walks in to his knees.
while his master in the dark nearby inspects the hands, with a brutal eye,
That have never brushed a lover's thigh but have squeezed a nation's threat.
But he hungers in his secret dreams for the harsh embrace of cruel machines
But his lover is not what she seems and she will not leave a note.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The Situation Tragedy
Grand Opera slick with soap
Cliffhangers with no hope
The water-colour in the flooded gallery...

There's a girl who'll push but not shove and is desperate for her father's love
She believes the hand beneath the glove maybe one she needs to hold.
Though she doubts her hosts moralities she decides she is more at ease
In the Land Of Doing What You Please than outside in the cold.
But the backdrop's peel and the sets give way and the cast gets eaten by the play
There's a murderer at the Matinee, there are dead men in the aisles
And the patrons and actors too are uncertain if the show is through
And with side-long looks await their cue but the frozen mask just smiles.

At last! The 1998 Show!
The torch-song no one ever sings
The curfew chorus line
The comedy divine
The bulging eyes of puppets strangled by their strings

There's thrills and chills and girls galore, sing-songs and surprises
There's something hear for everyone, (reserve your seat today)
There's mischief and malarkies but no queers or yids or darkies
Within this bastard's carnival, this vicious cabaret."" - Alan Moore


I wish I never had to leave immateria. I had a dream recently in which Tom (from theater), dressed as Gandalf (staff and all), offered me the chance to stay in the dream world forever. He told me that if I were to walk through the gate behind him, I would live there forever (mind, body and spirit).
I, of course, leapt at the chance. I was skeptical at first but with every step toward the gate, the dream became sharper, clearer so I couldn't help but hope.
As I am typing this, it obviously didn't work but I had a great deal of fun testing the boundless power I had once I knew I was dreaming. I created demons to fight, flew, teleported and my personal favourite: reshaping the world. I turned my demon arena into the garden of Eden just by willing it. During the transition, I flew in every direction through a vortex of swirling sound and colour.
After flying around for a while, admiring the beauty of my creation, I got talking to Eve. She told me to enjoy it while I could, 'Tomdolf' was in fact not the guardian of some ancient, mystical gate but in fact some crazy hobo who sleeps by some random gate conning random dreamers out of parts of themselves. I would confront him but I've been having trouble sleeping lately.
Eve proved she was write by saying ""open your eyes for a second"" and I did. I don't know if you would really call it waking up because I was right back discusing it with Eve after having my eyes closed again for about 5 seconds.

It was the second best dream I've ever had and was very boaring to wake up from. Still, Niel Gaimen created Sandman for moments just like this.

Now, there is definaitly sleep hidden behind one of these eyes. I'm going to have a look."

"event","""Sketches in the rain"" are congregating at Hazel's tomorrow to celebrate us all being back in the country. Can't wait to tell the Pisa airport story. I'll write it here for the benefit of thoughs who cannot be their.

I was in Italy for two weeks but had a flight plan to come home for three days so i could be there for my uncles funeral (had died once before when he was 10 but they brought him back to a broken body, mind and sight to sit in a coma for three months, he died 42). I was supposed to be helping to carry him. They checked my ticket three times; once at the gate, once at the stairs and once on the plain. We're almost at the runway when the prat who checked my ticket anounces that we're off to Dublin...I think not. I made them turn the plain around (taking a bow as I got to the front of the plain) but my flight had already goen. Right, no problem, I'll buy another ticket. Next flight 5:00pm the next day. After the funeral. Can't get hold of mum so it's either that and spend the night here or don't and spend three.

That doen, I go somewhere privet to through a good fit (knucles still hurt a little) and call dad telling him to go home as he was waitig at Gatwick. 

My phone rang just as I ran out of songs (I found it calming to perform to the randoms I would never see again), mum's phone was working again...

Couldn't get anything refunded and I was denide the honer of carying my uncle in that service but hey, you pay the price for the storys you tell."

I caught myself contemplating the best way to do myself in on the train home. I even drafted a suicide note in my head. One the upside, once you stop caring about death, doing things like M.D.M.A. doesn't bother you either. You only live once.

It just feels like everything that makes my life worth living has either lost it's apeal or is constantly being limeted. I can't think what I was doing diffently before i felt like this.

I have just deleted some things from this post as they were far too emo and i think you get the point now anyway.

I will finish by asking anyone who reads this not to mention this in school as i don't know how long this feeling will last and I will probably be embarrassed by this post when it is gone. (Ignor and excuse, there is not enough fluoxatine in my system for a guy who has this restricting operation)"

So that rules out the leaving party S.L.I. Bit of a shock going to dad's and seeing half my stuff in the car and heaing we have to go back for the rest. We don't live in the shop anymore because Nick hides all our letters. 

For those who witnessed the ""cult museum sulk"" yes I over-reacted. I didn't really care weather I went or not, but the way dad was talking to me. I might have been alright with ""I know You might be curious but I don't want you taking the risk...you can't go"" but it was so much more "" you are a stupid little boy who will, without a doubt, get brainwashed and even if you don't I'll dis-own you for going"".

You feel like a rock, so peaceful yet so powerful but only if you want to be, you can percive the high as being like different things. your head feels like it's moving up and down at the same time. 

The only negative was getting another blow to the head on my bed leg (don't ask me how).

Step brother and sister over today. Can't stand them. Pompous pricks.

I might suggest me and the family go to the pictures tonight when they go home. It's been a while scince we bonded (very important of coarse). you can't realy count scotland because I spent the whole time reading on top of that cliff.

Shut up. Going to the pictures is bonding. you get the ride there deciding what to watch and the ride back discusing how great or otherwise the film was.

Drugs are a more adult form of suger induced happyness.

A couple of old men came in today and tryed to use their age to get cheap stuff. First they pretended to miss hear me then maraculasly their memoury went and then they started acting all dissaprooving of the cost: ""cor-blimy that can't be right can it...well things were cheaper in my day"".

I was thinking ""I don't realy care how much it was in your day, this is how much it is so you can stop giving me that look as if you expect me to make an exeption. It's not going to happen"".

we have a couple of 60 year old paper men who i cannot stand. The're friendly enough but the smell is overpowering. Emagine the combined effects of Shit, Sweat, Stail smoke and beer.

I've used these proverbs before but I like them:

The wise man does not stand benieth a collapsing wall.
-Traditional.

Distant water cannot quench a fire close at hand.
-Li Chu, spring and autumn period

Eat less, taste more.
-Traditional.

I eat only to live.
-The queen of Zhao, warring states period.

There is no logical reason for this misfortune. Thus it must be part of my destiny.
-Zi Sang, Zhou.

He who has many sons, has many worries. He who is rich, has many trobles. He who lives a long time, suffers many changes in fortune.
-Emperor Yao, c. 2300BC (always the optamist)

Dying embers can still start a fire.
-Western Han Dynasty.

Failure lies not in falling down, but in not getting up.
-Traditional.

I hope I feel normal again before too much of this year passes, I think I know how to do this but it will be difficult either way I go about it. Maybe if I stay realy still and ignor it, it will go away.

I love that expresion ""words fail me"". It just suggests the kind of thing that 

you remain. my power, my pleasur, my pain.

I'm sorry. As carefully as I tried to write it, I clearly failed.

When I said I didn't want an apology, I meant it. I really didn't even expect you to read it (so many of my posts have been wiped off by all your other internet friends), it was more for my sake than yours, just to get it out of my system. I thought I'd made that clear. I'm sorry.

I walked down at 4:00am to edit my post and put that in, unable to sleep. This is my problem, I get paranoid. When I come out with crap like that I don't expect you to listen. Like I said ""take it with a pinch of salt"".

I do not think you have dodgy conversations over the internet. I don't know what got into me, I haven't seen you in so long so I've been thinking about you and suddenly that post popped into my head while I was typing and I couldn't let it go. I even decided not to say anything and went to bed but it just wouldn't let me rest.

I did think once I got back into bed that I worded it wrong when I said ""don't tell ME"". I know I'm not the only person who reads your entries and that I have no right to tell you what to put in your journal. Once again, I am very, very sorry.

As for how it's ""being played"" I honestly couldn't be more confused by that. I wasn't trying to play anything. I just got upset and I am sincerely sorry.

The good news is that once I'm back on this therapy coarse that starts the second weekend of term and get a good way into my books dealing with anger and such, I should be much more together.

Such is the extent of my amusment(s). I am determind to see someone before I go away. There is no way life can be this dull. I am in desperate need of human contact, without it I am sinicle and it means that i'm left alone with my own brain which we all know is very dangerous."

Apart from that today was entirly unspectacular. Feeling a bit too shut off from the world. my friends are either away, too busy or so far away that I'd need to spend more than one day with them for it to be worth the journy. AND I DON'T HAVE MORE THAN ONE DAY.

"event","I have spent the last two nights thoroughly Stoned, running around north london for no reason what-so-ever. The first night we (me and Neil) had dry mouth, having just climed down 4 storys of balconys (without waking anyone up) and discovering the trains were not running, we walked to camdon to find a shop that was still open. Failling this we cept into a hotel, nicked some ice from the dipencer and lay crunching it on the roof.

But of corse ""dry mouth"" cannot be satisfide for long and soon we came up with the fabulas idea of calling Steph and asking if we could come around for some water. Sounding very tired, she consented to try and get some water to drop uot of the window. So we jog for about 45 mins until we get there and cannot wake her up again so that was a big waist of time.

James icurently in canader so we decided for some ungodly reason to jog along thtrain traks to west hamstead and cime through his window to go to sleep. so running along train traks at 3 in the morning we  had to dive left to avoid a mile-long dobble decker train coverd in cars. It was such a long train it just stopped being funny. We got about half way there before grabing a bench, taking off our t-shirts to as pillows and smoking a little more. Unfortunatly this was not the motivation we needed to carry on running and we were soon incapasitated.

After climing back into neils bedroom window, we sleeped until 2pm wich we were very pissed of about. We took our reveng by loading burgers, sossages, bbq sause, orange juice, wiskey, burger buns, graips and a lemon into my bag and walking out of sainsburys. What folowed was a drunken trek after this one-armed guy on a bike (we wanted weed and he only had skunk). He was so adamant that he could get us our weed that we spent the next 3 hours running around brixten seeing about 20 of his friends none of which had any. so that left us jogging from there to Rudie's house, smoke his weed, eat his food, pass out on his floor and head home in the morning.

I recieved your text whilest running after the one-armed man and I felt so elated. But I was too drunk to handle it with grace and Neil bore the brunt of my soppy ramblings.

Exuse my slowness but wasn't last night wednesday. Oh well, I'll try and call you tonight.

I love you xxx

P.S. i don't know how I've spelt any of this and the spell check is showing about 50 words but i'm sure you can figure it out. I'm going to sleep now, I'll edit it some other time

Once again I love you, goodnight xxx

I recon Harry Potter is a horcrux (hummer me). ""You know who"" was trying to make a horcrux with Harry's death so as ""you know who"" attempted to kill Harry and his soul was split, maybe the reflected cures only killed part of his soul and the other part was transferred to Harry. This would explain the whole emotional connection thing and it would create an interesting twist because once he'd killed Voldimort he would have to kill himself. I know there is the argument that he is unable to posses Harry but if it were simply a dormant piece of soul...

yes sometimes I think too much... Shut up.

I have done more than I would had I not been pushed; I would never have thought to start reading the news paper but the parental units quite rightly set me at it. it's at least 3 aspects of MR CAGE in the bag garentied.

Looking forward to giving Allie the most loving hug i can muster tomorow (and posebly give Charlie's balls the hardest kick I can muster)so tomorows not all bad.

The funniest story in the Mail; some politition (Mr brown: Labour) invited a writer for the mail (a majourly anti-Labour news paper) to watch the england match with him. the plan of coarse being to humanize him and get the mail to stop slandering his cause. To say it backfired would be an understatement. The article took the piss out of mr Brown as if he had doen them a great personal wrong. They focused on his low-cal, low-carb beer, his smart cloths in contrased to his red and white clad nabours and that they were insulted that he dared try and trick them into writing nice things about him. I can not do the article Justice here and to be honest it's only funny because it vaigly reminds me of the complaint letter to NTL but i have to pick up on these small things to get me through the day.

"event","I've always thought the question of ""why?"" is over used in these situations.  But having experienced this recently, seems to be the only question coming to mind. Sure there are other thoughts, but just this question.  Not sure why an insignificant blog source is really the only way I seem to be able to organize my thoughts on the issue.

Wish I had been a better friend while the opportunity still existed.
Wish I had returned the last phone call.
Wish we had followed up on the multiple plans this summer.
Wish it didn't hit home so badly.
Wish I had the courage to go to the service.  Not that I don't want to cry in front of people.  I just can't explain why.

Family members (recently and past), old friend who hadn't had a choice, really sucked, but different.  This for some reason, worse than them all.

Just don't know how to feel.

p.s. sorry I can't just talk about it.  wish I had a better explanation."

the things i don't understand though are-

why they bought a BIGGER house when i'm moving out at the end of the summer, and travis isn't coming home from walla walla for the summer anymore.

why they buy ping pong and pool tables for the new bigger house months before they're going to be the only ones living there.  maybe to make us want to come home???

and finally, why they bought the house where my bathroom consists of all pink things (including the damn toilet, counter tops, sink, shower tile, etc)"

I wish I could just quit.  We are going to close on our house a week from tomorrow and I am really excited about that, but it will make this month busier.  I wish I could take some time off to move and stuff, but I just took three days off to go to Beaumont to see Damian's grandparents.  I have a ton of overtime and days that I could take off, but there is so much to do at work that there is no way that I can do that.  Okay, time for bed."

"event","Things have been going okay recently.  We are in the middle of trying to buy a house.  I am ready to have the process over and to be moved in.  The inspection came back saying that some repairs needed to be made, and the owners are willing to make them, but we will see.  I won't believe we are moving until after the closing.  We are hoping that the closing will be sometime in the middle of July.  We will have a lot of painting and stuff to do before moving in, and I am not looking forward to that.  It will be fun to pick out our own stuff and make it how we want it.  
Damian's 30th birthday was Saturday.  We had a good time.  I got him a ping pong table and some family and friends all went to a baseball game.  It was a good time, and I think that it was fun for Damian.  I am hoping that after we move we can have friends over more often for games and stuff.  Right now we do not have much space, and the dogs get too excited.
Work is still going okay, but I think I am getting a little burnt out.  It is such a time consuming job, and I don't feel like I can have a normal personal life.  I can not be on any type of schedule in the evenings because I never really know when I will be getting home.  The families that I work with are so needy and cannot do anything for themselves.  They kind of drag you down.  They live in crisis mode all the time, and it makes me just want peace for them.  I did not know that so many people live a lifestyle involving drugs and deceit.  It is so sad, and the kids are so sad.  I never really know if I am helping them or hurting them.  The ones that are old enough to know who I am and what I represent are terrified of me.  I am not used to being that person.  I was the art teacher that most of the kids loved to go and see because I represented fun.  I feel bad that the kids don't trust me, and I can't even promise them that they will get to stay living with their parents.  I think I will try and stick it out for one more year and see where we are.  I hope that in a year Damian will have a full time job and we will have adopted a child.  Maybe I'll be able to work part time or stay home.  We will see...."

"event","Well, I decided to update my journal.  Easter was fine.  Nothing major.  I got home yesterday and fell asleep.  I slept forever and it felt good.  I was really tired.  I am a little overwhelmed right now.  I have a lot to do at work before I go out for my surgery.  After I get back I will be playing the catch up game.  I like not having to make substitute lesson plans, but the work is not so piled up when you return.  This month is going by really fast.  I don't know where it went.  Oh well."

"event","Well, I have to have surgery again.  Yuck.  I was really bummed out about it on Friday.  I knew it was coming and I figured the doctor would tell me that I had to have it, but I was hoping to be able to wait.  I am going to have another myomectomy....so I get to keep my uterus for now.  Unfortunately this means I am postponing the problem for later and will have to have another surgery in a few years.  I am hoping to schedule it for the beginning of May, but I don't know if I will get my wish.  It would just work out a lot better with my job.  
My doctor also told me that I am not hopeless in the baby department.  It is nice to hear her enthusiasm, but she hasn't even seen my previous medical records yet.  She does not know everything I have already gone through.  She said that she wanted me to go back to the infertility doctor for one last try.  I have mixed feelings about this.  Part of me feels like I am getting the surgery, so I may as well try again, and part of me says that I am stupid for having any hope about it at all.  I want to have a life that does not revolve around doctor appointments and medication.  I am perfectly fine with adoption....we just can't do that yet.  AAARRRRR!!!  I hate all this stuff.  I want to be fixed or be broken....none of this in between stuff!  It is so hard to pick what to do!"

"event","Well,  I went to the doctor yesterday.  I still have to go on Friday, but at least one is down.  This doctor told me that I have to keep taking Metformin, a diabetic drug, and aspirin.  He said that I will probably have to take the aspirin for the rest of my life because of my blood issues.  I might have to take the diabetic medicine forever, too, but we don't know yet.  I am not diabetic at this time, but I have a lot of chances of getting it, so we are trying to prevent it.  Hopefully it will work.  Anyway, not much else is going on.  Damian and I just got back from the REC center, and I need to take a shower.  I don't ever seem to have anything deep or meaningful to say.  Jennifer writes about a lot of things that she thinks about, and Adam writes some awesome poems, but I think I am just going to be plane jane.  Maybe some day I'll be inspired to write something throughtful or thought provoking, but for now I am happy with myself for actually writing anything at all!!"

"event","Okay, so I forgot my password and have not written in here for a while.  I tried all the possible passwords that I had at Jennifer's the other day, and I know it again, so I am back.
  
I have been busy working lately.  Trying to get used to my new job is stressful.  I have not figured out how to organize myself and it is hard to remember all of the things that I have to do.  It is also hard because the lives of kids depend on how I handle things.  I do like the job so far, but I am definitely seeing a different side to the world.  I am learning a lot about drugs and the lower economic class.  Some people really have things bad, and a lot of it isn't their fault.  It makes me appreciate what I have been blessed with.  I grew up in a good family and always had the things I needed and wanted.  I never questioned my parents love for me or my sister and brother.  We had some problems growing up, but nothing compared to what I am seeing now.

I have been somewhat moody lately, and I can't really put my finger on why. Some of it might be my job, and some of it is personal life, but I catch myself being irritable, and I am really trying to not take it out on other people.  Sometimes I feel like too many things are going on in my brain.
Next week I have two doctor appointments.  One is for a physical because I think I have been having a few problems with circulation.  I am always paranoid that I am going to get diabetes because it runs in my family and I have a high likelihood of getting it....at least that is what doctors have told me.  

My other appointment is just a well-woman exam, but I am really afraid that she will say that I need surgery again.  I really don't want to hear that right now because it makes me feel like I have to decide between a hysterectomy or a myomectomy again.  I already had a myomectomy, and I can't keep having those.  They are too invasive and they weaken my uterus each time they are done.  It was less than a year after my first surgery that my doctor was already talking about surgery again.  If I don't get the myomectomy then I will have to get a hysterectomy because my fibroids are getting too big again.  They can start pushing into things that matter...and I won't be able to go the bathroom and stuff like that.  I can tell that my fibroids are getting big again.  I am getting the same types of pains that I used to get, but so far I don't have trouble with the bathroom.  At the time of my other surgery I was having trouble.  I don't know if that means they aren't as big yet, or maybe they grew in a different direction this time and aren't pushing so much in that area.  Oh well...I'll find out next week."

"event","My sister said that I have not updated my journal recently, so here I am.  She threatened to nudge me!!  I haven't updated it because I didn't feel like I had enough to say yet.  I had a good weekend.  Jennifer and Desiree came to visit and we had a great time at the science museum.  It was fun to hang out with them for the day.  Jennifer talked about it a lot on her journal, so if you want to know more about our trip you can read hers.  I think the same people read both of our journals, so I don't want to give out the same information.  Today Damian and I went to a friend's house and learned how to play rumicube (sp?)  It was a fun game.  I came in second and Damian came in third!  I want to play it again.  After that I went to the Rec Center and worked out.  I went there every day last week except for Monday.  I am going to try and go as often as I can.  I went to church this weekend and it was respect life weekend.  Sometimes I get irritated with the Catholic church because they talk so much about abortion and how a life is formed at conception, but they don't ever really say anything about miscarriages or specifically pray for those babies.  I have been listening to the mass intentions, etc. for the last year kind of hoping for them to say something about miscarriages or stillbirths as well as abortions...or even a prayer for parents who lost children, and I haven't ever heard any prayers for child deaths besides abortion.  I kind of want to ask our priest why.  I think all child deaths are important.  I have heard intentions for parents to love their unborn children, and I have heard prayers for expectant mothers.  Anyway, this is just something I am curious about.  Do I have to specifically ask them to say an intention for miscarriages and stillbirths?"

"event","Yesterday and today were pretty good days.  I am starting to get busy at work, and I like that.  So far I am liking my job a lot.  Today I drove all over the place doing stuff.  It is nice to be able to drive around like that.  I actually get to be outside some.  I think I would have a hard time at a job that I had to sit down all day.  Damian starts his accounting class tonight.  He is already there.  I hope that he likes it.  I am glad that he is trying new stuff.  Last night and the night before we were reading our devotional thing. (It has all of the daily reading in it) and it was talking about Hannah.  She could not have children.  Her husband had two wives and the other wife could have kids.  She rubbed it in Hannah's face a lot, and Hannah was very sad.  It talks about her not eating and crying to God about wanting a ""male child.""  Her husband asked her what was wrong, and he asked her if he was not enough for her.  I thought this was interesting.  I guess it has been hard for men and women to communicate about children for a long time.  I asked Damian the other day if he was sad that the anniversary of our miscarriage is almost here.  He said that he was sad because I was sad.  I don't think he would have even remembered that it has almost been a year.  That makes me sad, too.  Hannah eventually has a child, but I don't think that the Bible talks much about her after that.  Her child was Samuel, and they do talk about him.  I guess the reading gives me some hope that I won't be so sad about all of this someday.  It is weird, too, because I have been thinking about Dad a lot recently.  I think my brain has mixed the sadness of losing Dad and the baby.  A lot of times I think about them both.  Jennifer was talking about some sort of resolution this year.  I really don't do those either, but I want to be happier with myself.  For the most part I like myself, but I think I have become too bitter.  I am a lot more pessimistic than I would like to be.  I am starting to think the worst before I think the best.  I don't like that.  I am not sure how to change this yet, but I am thinking about it."

"event","Well, My sister and brother think that I need to have a journal so that they can know more about what is going on in my life, so I made one.  They pretty much already know what is going on, but I guess I'll type it anyway.  (I would like to point out that I do a lot of typing for my job now, and they are making me type even more!!!)  Oh well.  Okay...Amy's news of the week.  (I will try to give you ten things, but I might not have ten)
1) Damian got accepted into UT Arlington to begin his master's in accounting.  I am very happy about this.  I think he will do great.  I am worried about paying for it, though. 
2) I learned two new jokes yesterday.  Adam has already heard them.  The first joke is...How do you clean a sheep?........You give him a BAAAth!  HA!!  I love it!  The second joke is.....What type of fish likes gum?.......A Blowfish!!  HA again!  I like the sheep one better. 
3) Today Damian and I are going to go to the dog park.  After that we are going to go see Rose at her niece's house.  We are going to go to a store called Sam Moon.  I have heard good things about that store.  I have wanted to go for a while and now I get to!  
4) I don't have to work today!  
5) I have two weeks of training left and then I will be on my own at work.....but I don't have an office yet.  This is the tricky part of being on my own.  I am not sure how to do my work without an office.
6) I still love my new car (my car is also serving as an office right now)
7)I have been sad this week because a year ago I was pregnant, and the one year anniversary of our miscarriage is almost here.  Because I have been sad I bought three new adoption books and an adoption magazine the other day, but I can't read them yet because they make me cry.  Maybe after Feb.
8)Our friends got a new dog on Saturday and she is really cute.
9)I am still happy that we have renters in our house, but I REALLY want to sell it.
10)  It is time for me to go to the dog park, so I have to stop typing."

"event","This past week has been very busy...
Monday, tuesday, and wednesday were normal. Thursday I skated 2 hours and then hung out with justine in the cafe with Craig. Then I went to go skate the public session, I only skated like 30 minutes because my ankle was bothering me and I did not want to push it because I was competing in 2 days. After skating I baby-sat my nephew then I hung out with some friends.
Friday I skated 1 hour and then took a break with jess and bailey. I went back on for my lesson with Jess. The beginning was rough but it got much better. We worked on the little things between all the elements in my program and also axles. The axles were really good. After that I hung out with Justine and sloane. That was interesting(fun times with justine's phone). I came home and got everything ready for saturday and went to bed at like 8.
I woke up saturday at 5 30 and we left for colonial at 6. I slept the whole way up so I really have nothing to say about that. I got there and walked around and got dressed. When Jordan got there we did my make-up and warmed up. My program went ok. My axles were very much cheated and my presentation was not very good at all. One thing that stuck in my head was the picture of my layback. Boy! That's gonna need a lot of work, haha. I got fourth out of six in that.
After I skated I went with my parents and grandparents to get a bit to eat. Then we headed back to the rink. I got ready and went back out there. I skated a very good program. Cheated again but nice axles and my axel combination was good. My presentation was very good and everything else was excellent. I won that.
After I skated we went to lunch with chelsea and Jordan where we ran into Justine. After lunch we came home to get changed for the wolfpack game. It was great. After the we talked to the guys we went to The Red Plate for a very late dinner(11 pm) where I talked to Justine on the phone, and ate a calzone. Then it was time for bed and church in the morning. Now I am finally relaxing....

Congrats to Chels and Justine on the triplet gold medals!"

"event","WOW! IT has been almost five months since I have updated. A lot has happened since last time.....
I have switched coaches. I am now skating with Jessica and Jordan. They really are a great team and it has been really fun and interesting. My plan for skating is to do colonial this weekend and then take a break with the competitions until Cranberry Open in ?August?. I am going to test so I an compete in open juv for regionals. I am really excited. But it has been a lot of hard work and I know it won't get any easier.
I still have no boyfriend. And I kind of don't want one. I am too busy for one and I think I would get too distracted.
I think I have changed a lot since december. It is hard for me to describe how but I know that the people who hang out with me on a daily basis have seen it.
I don't know how often I will be able to update, I am not on the computer as much as I used to but I will do my best!"

I am so happy that I went. It was hard for me to see all those sick kids. I was so thankful for everything I can do, walk, skate, run, etc... After that I came home and did all my christmas baking, then I took a shower, and got ready to go out. I went shopping because I had a date tonight and I had nothing to wear. It went really good, but I don't know if I want to really go steady with him. But I am happy with how it went, and I do like him. I am really tired so I am going to go to bed. I will update on my boring life later. Bye!"

"event","Hey,
Symphony went so good! It was so much fun. I am so excited for next year. I am doing Camp Care tomorrow, then it is only a week until christmas!
Today was my first lesson with Jess. It went really good. I was so happy. But during my lesson a few people kept on giving me looks, that kind of pissed me off. I mean it is my decision who to skate with.
On wednesday I like had an anxiety attack( I don't think that I really had one but that is what everyone is saying happened to me). It was really scary though. I started shaking and I couldn't breathe and I was just really neavous and anxious. I think that it is because I havent't really slpet in a week or so. I have been on the go ever since Symphony. Like, I only did school work once this whole week. That means that I will be doing school all weekend.
I think that I am getting sick. My throat really hurts. That might be from not getting enough sleep too. But I don't want to get sick for christmas. Last year I was so sick that I had to open my presents in bed! It reall sucked. I am not going to be sick again this year!
Ok, now I am just typing and not really saying anything, so I think I am going to go and get ready to leave. I will update whenever something worth writing happens."

Skating is going ok. My axel is fucked up and so is my double salchow though. It is really hard to break bad habbits.
Right now I am boyless and I never thought that I would be saying this but I really want a boyfriend. I miss the way that your boyfriend looks at you and treats you. Oh well, I will just have to wait.
Oh and I like gained like 10 pounds or something, well I don't know but i do know I look fatter.
Ok I am off."

It is so weird, my life has been pretty normal lately. But I have been obsessing about my weight lately. I want to loose weight and now I have gotten to the point where I will go all day without eating, I know it is really bad. But I walk around the rink looking at all these girls that are like pencils. I always say that it is so gross how they look, but yet I try so hard to look like that. 
Yesterday at the rink was so much fun! Jess, Kara, Kimmy, and Kate were there. We had so much fun. And the cool thing was, was that everyone was hanging out together and actually getting along! It was amazing, you all know I am just kidding. I wish I had more to write about my exciting life but it really isn't that exciting right now, but don't get used to this."

I am so upset right now. I am just thinking a lot about stuff.
I skated today, I did some footwork and moves, and I got to spin! I was so happy, it pretty well to, well my back spins were really bad,lol. But what do you expect? I have been having fun at Symphony, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be.
Chase for some reason blocked me, but I don't think I really care anymore,lol. He and Scot got into a fight, I don't even know why they would talk to eachother, they don't even know eachother. Well, I thought that I still liked Chase but I really don't.
Zack called and it was so good to hear his voice. I miss them all so much, I wish they would just come home. But he is happy so it is all good.
I hate the rink shit. Everyone just stabs eachother in the back and lies to them and just is plain out mean to eachother.I am not blaming it all on the other girls, I know I am part of it too. But I do wish it would stop. People are just so jealous of eachother, and it has gotten to the point were it is sickening.
I am feeling so sick right now, thinking about the rink, skating, coaches, family, ""friends"", and enemies. I wish people could just get along and not play all this bullshit that people actually play."

"event","WOW, it's been a little while. Well things are going ok. 
My ankle is getting there. I can put my skate on and walk around on it for a little while, so I think that is a good sign.
I am doing really good in school. I am like 2 months ahead. I am trying to graduate early. But someone was talking to me about college, and she said that I should start thinking about what schools I want to look into. I don't even know what I want to do. I keep saying that I have plenty of time and that I shouldn't think about it, but then I look at Chadd who is graduating in June and he doesn't even know what school he wants to go to. I don't want to be like that, so I have been thinking a lot about college lately.
The past few weeks I have been thinking a lot about Zack. I realized how much I really miss him. I still can't believe that he is gone. I wish that he would just come home. I just think of him with another girl and it is really hard for me. I have a problem with letting go of people. I need to get over it, and realize that Zack is gone and I need to move one. But it's like, who do I move on with? 
I have been going through a lot lately. I am making things that are no big deal into a big deal. I think my problem is, is that I think about things too much, and I hold on to people when all they want is to be let go. And so I always end up getting hurt. There are many examples of that happening to me, but they are kind of personal. But if you want to know just ask me and if I want to tell you I will and if I don't I won't. Ok, I am going to go and stare at my dinner and do some crunches now. Bye!"

Maine was so much fun!!! Everybody did a great job.
My ankle is doing really good. I can walk on it now and the sweling went down, but not completely, and it is still black and blue. I can't wait to skate again. There is not much to say about the past week, except that it is amazing how many times I got into arguements with a 10 year old!!! It was really funny though. I got back on sunday arounf 8 and I called my parents to tell them to come and get me fomr Chelsea's house and they said that I should just sleep over there because they were out with friends. I couldn't believe ir. I hadn't seen them for 9 days!!! So I made them come and get me. Yesterday I just did school work and cleaned, then I went to Symphony practice. On the way home a made a stop at Kevin's house and we talked. But about Symphony.... I hate doing it. I don't know why, I mean the people are so nice and everything, but I just don't like it. My parents are making me do it because they invited all their friends to the show. So I got into a big fight with them about that. Chadd finally got his license, but I can't drive with him for another 3 months. I am so excited to though, it is going to be awesome! I am trying to think of some other stuff that you guys don't know about....... ok well I can't think of it. But.....
Today I am going over my brother's house to spend some time with him and the baby. I haven't seen them for two weeks! I miss them so much!
Oh and Chase you are such a jackass and I will get you back for what you did to me last night, both things!"

Yesterday was on ok day. I skated for 2 hours and sat around at the rink for 2 hours. After that I went to clean and then i came home and played with Alerek. Then I went to go baby-sit for my cousins. So nothing really has been happening.

My nephew, Alerek Ricardo Mitera, was boron on Sunday, at 3:15 in the morning. He is so cute! So I have been busy over there helping her with him. He is very fussy though. But I still love him.
I have now started Symphony practice. It is really hard, but I guess it will kind of fun. I met a lot of nice people so far. I just can't wait until it is over because then it almost Christmas.
I got new skates yesterday and I had a lesson with Micheal. It was the most interesting lesson I have ever had! I hate getting new skates.
I didn't get to skate today and I was really upset about that because I had plans at the rink some friends, but oh well.
Tonight I am going to et my new tv. I have been waiting forever to get it!
I have more I want to say but as usual I will not post that online, so if you want to know then ask me and depending on who you are I will spill!

Ok, so much has been happening...... A lot of shit has been going on at the rink. People are assuming that I have been talking about them and starting rumors and that really gets me upset because I haven't. I have been hearing rumors myself and I am now wondering if I am making the right decision for my coaches.
I am still not an aunt yet! She is like 6 days late. I want her to have the baby. Everyone is just sitting around waiting for her to have it, it is kind of funny. 
Last night I was talking to a friend on the phone and she told me of how a specific person has been avoiding me and doesn't want to talk to me. I was so pissed because I really enjoyed being friends with that person and I thought that we were good friends. But just because that person hooked up with someone they think they can treat people like shit. And I will not be treated like that, I am done being treated like that!
On a happier note.... I have landed my double salchow and double loop a few times now, but still not consistently. But I feel very confident in landing them. But Alena said that my axel is messed up. I thought it was good, and Micheal never said anything about it. I was trying to fix it but i kept falling on my ass, haha. And I can finally do a decent layback!! It is about damn time. My layback was so demented for so long it is not even funny. And I will be testing me pre-juv moves in november. It is about time too. I have been on them for a long time. After that I am testing my juv moves in January. I am excited that I am finally getting on with moves, but I still have a very long way to go.
There is more that has been happening with me but I really don't feel comfortable posting it. But I will write back when the baby is born or sooner!"

You need to let them go the way the are going to go(if that makes sense). I need to let so many things go and let go of certain people. I hold on way too long but I am now moving on. But now I am afraid of getting close to people. It seems that whenever I begin to get close to someone, no matter who they are, they seem to go away. It is kind of scary.
Well on that note.......
Today was really funny. I skated and plyed cards with Kim. We played Bullshit, even though it is impossible to play that with only two people. After that I cleaned. Then I went to this party. I acted so gay at the party. It was so much fun. After the party we decided to go out for pizza. We like almost burnt the place down, haha. Ok well i ahve to go now."

After we checked in we went shopping!!! That was really the best part of the trip. After we went shopping we went to a seafood buffet, they had really good food. The next day we went to Busch Gardens, that was ok. I saw some really cute guys and I started talking to them and they had this funny accent. It was funny. The next day we went to boring Colonial Williamsburg. That was the worst part of the trip. It started to rain, I got so wet. Then my mom got sick and we had to bring her to the hospital. We were waiting there for 3 and 1/2 hours!! I was so mad, but I felt bad for my mom. But we got to go to one of my favorite restaurants, Applebees. Yesterday I was getting ready in the bathroom and my parents and brother were downstairs eating breakfast and the room service guy walked in on me!! He didn't even knock, it was so scary. On the trip home we decided to stop in Baltimore and visit Zack's family. It was very interesting. If you want to know what happened with that you have to ask me because I am not going to post that information, haha. Now that I am home I have to start my school work. I am going to work hard though because I want to get done early. When we came home this morning the crazy life started all over again. Apparently something happened with my oldest brother when we were gone, I don't even know what, but I know something happened. But he is not in danger or anything, I think he is just not thinking. I am so excited to skate tomorrow!! My parents wouldn't let me skate today because they said that i needed to rest today but it is driving me crazy that I can't skate!

I skated in cromwell for 4 hours and then I went to newington and jumped for 1 hour. I had a lot of fun with ZAck and Beki and Jill( oh and how can I forget abourt chase). Chase I send my condolences, lol. Anyways, my jumps were ok. I had farely good double loops and my double flips I think should just go to hell. Today I had a long talk with my parents. They heard some rumores about me making out in locker rooms and some other shit. They talked to me about concentrating on school and skating and not on boys. Then they asked me if there was anything I needed to tell them. I really wish people would just mind their own business because when they don't they just start trouble for others.

I was really pissed, not so much that we broke up but of how and when it happened. We were only dating a week. But we are friends and it is probably better that way. 
There has been so much shit going on at the rink. I hate how your business is everyone else's business, and how people talk about other people behind their back, I also hate how mean people are to each other. I really hate it!!!! 
My skating has been going really well. I have landed my double salchow numerous times, I have to work on landing it consistently though. I am getting very frustrated with my double loop though,I can feel that I am so close to landing it, but it is just not happening. I tried doing some double flips the other day.........lol, that was a huge joke! I fell so hard on my ass, it is so sore now, but it's all good. 
My family life has been very hectic. My nephew is coming ina month and everyone is talking about the baby, don't get me wrong I am really excited and I am going to love that baby to death, but people are getting annoying. They are all like ""When is  the baby coming? are you gonna baby-sit? what is his name? oh I don't like that name"". I have been getting along with my parents really well though, we haven't had a fight in a really long time. Same with my brothers and Onny.
So I guess you could say that my life is going farely well. I can't think of anything else to write but I am sure that I will soon, so I will be updating soon. Until then, Love ya, and ttyl!"

"event","I just got back from Maine last night. It was a relaxing trip. I went to the beach everyday. I loved it. But my little cousins really got on my nerves. They followed me around everywhere. To make a long story short: I really don't like having little cousins, but I love them!
Before I left there was a lot of confusing things going on in my life. This kid was flirting with me and i was flirting back. We even had this little thing happen between us one day. But things went back to normal. Another kid sent me these emails that at first I was scared of and then was happy about. He wants to go out. I am not sure if I want to go out with him though. I really don't know him. I think that I will change my mind once I get to know him. He seems really nice and sweet. But we never see each other! I was telling Jessie about the kid that wants to go out with me and the other kid overheard me say that I liked the one that wants to go out with me but I still had feelings for ""someone else"". I know that he knows that it is him. And he said this,""the 1st cut is the deepest, the second isn't so bad, go for it, make yourself happy, follow your first instinct"". I was like what the hell does that mean? Some people told me that they thought that he was trying to tell me that he still liked me and the people that are close to him sayed that he would tell me straight out if he liked me or not. Well I guess it really doesn't matter because I heard a rumor that he is moving to another state! I am so sad, But maybe this is a good thing. Now I can totally forget about him. And I wont get hurt anymore."

Boys wise, I will infrom you all at another time. 
I just got back from this church thing in Baltimore(you all are prb like ""omg! church!"" but it wasn't that bad). I met some really cool people there. I had a lot of fun. I am leaving again for Maine on saturday. I am going with my whole family. I am really excited. Then I am leaving two days later for Canada. When I get back I have to work really hard for the competition on Simsbury. It is a week after I get back!!! Ok I will write later, when my cuz leaves."

"event","Hi Ya'll!!! A lot has happened since I have written, so here it is....
My skating is going well. I almost have my double loop and my double sal. is looking better. My axel was doing very well but then today it wasen't all that great. My spins are faster and tighter, and my footwork is getting better. Last night we got a phone call from Skate Hickory, and they told me that I could not compete next weekend because I sent the registration form in a day late. One day!! And it was their fault that they did not get it on time because their website was down. I am so pissed! I really wanted to compete!
I was kind of confused about me and this kid because we were totally flirting last week and then all of a sudden we are just friends. I am just going to give up on him. We will never go out. So now that I am over him I am looking for a bf, so if your interested let me know(jk). 
OMG!!! One of my friends, which will remain nameless, is getting so annoying! She is just so immature. And she always has to be right, and everything always has to be her way. I am trying to stay quiet and see if she changes but if nothing changes I am going to be forced to tell her.
Oh and exciting news(well for me not you, you wont really care)! I changed my music for the show. I am doing that song from the ""Lilo and Stitch Movie"". I am so excited. On Wednesday Jordan and I are going to start choreographing it. I am so excited!!!! I hope I will have my axel and double loop in it.
Let's see, what else?
Well that is all that I can actually put in print.
I will write soon.
Bye Byezzzzzzz"

"event","Hi everyone!!
I had a great weekend. I went on a ""family get-away"". It surprisingly not that bad. I slept, ate, ate, ate, and slept some more. It was great. The yesturday I got to see my cuz's ex-boyfriend. I feel bad saying this but he is so hot. We went to the mall and hung out(we are just friends!). 
I did some sewing yesturday. I finshed the job that I was doing and now I am gonna get paid!!! I hat sewing but my mom really wants me to do it so.... It is like a trade mark in my family so I guess I should just do it.
I had a really good skating day. I was landing my axel almost everytime a attempted it. I was so happy. But then during my lesson, Michael taught me these two weird exercises and i just couldn't do them! I was getting so fusturated, especially when I saw that Michael was getting upset too. And then we started doing double sawchows. I had a lot of trouble with them because my singles are messed up and we ahd to fix them. It is really hard to change somthing that you have been doing all along. It was so fusturating, but I finally got it. Now all I have to work on is rotating all the way. It is so strange to start doubles. It is like you are learning the basics all over again. The rest of my sakting was so good. In my lesson with Jordan: We worked on footwork and some jumps. I am so happy. I finally see myself progressing in skating!
Boy friend wise, I am still single. It kind of sucks but then again it doesn't. I want one but I am not going to keep putting my feelings out there for people who don't care. i am kind of scared to have a boyfriend cuz you never know when they are just going to hurt you.
And oh my god!! I have a friend that won't leave me the hell alone, I know that friends are supposed to hang out and have fun but sometimes you need a break. Why can't this girl understand that? And why does she think she can just walk all over me? She ignores me when one person is around but then when that girl is gone she starts talking to me and hangs on me like a puppy dog. I hate bitches like that!"

"event","Hi everyone. I am here sitting in this miserable heat. I like the summer but I am so not prepared for this kind of heat yet. Kirsten is here and we are going to the movies tonight. 
I had a farely good day. My jumps were ok. I hate that damn axel! Well my laybacks are looking better. It doesn't look like I am making out with the ceiling anymore(inside joke). And the people at the gym are really stupid. And Mikey's cologne smells really good.
I am pissed because I have to go on this stupid family vacation for the weekend. It is going to totally suck! I get to see my cousin's ex-boyfriend. So that means I get to here about how she broke his heart. Do you know what kid? Get over it!! You guys live in to different states. It wouldn't of have worked anyways!!
Oh and I get to see Zack. I really can't wait. Yea right! I hate that shit head. 
And by the way, if one more person talks to me about sex I am going to kill myself!
Ok well I hope you all have a goodnight. I know I will."

My brother moved out because he and my parents could not get along. But it is ok because he has been over a few times and they seemed ok. I just really miss him.
My skating is doing very well. My axels are so much better. I have been working on doubles and they seem to be coming along. I hat lay back spins though!
I saw my ex-boyfriend, Zack,when I was baby-sitting. He stopped by the house to see if we could talk. I told him no and I shut the door in his face. I really don't understand guys. 
Oh and to let a specific person know, You will not get away with what you are doing. 
Why does life have to come with bitchy things and people? If you can answer me on that email me at: hmitera@comcast.net. thank-you"

Today was a very stressful. I found out that my brother's girlfriend's baby is a boy. I am kinda dissappointed about that. I don't know why. Well maybe I do. The mother said that she does not want her son to figure skate. I was so pissed at her!
Then my brother is like in soo much trouble. My dad keeps yelling at me tonight. Oh, and I found out that Zack is going back out with his ex! I mean if he didn't want to go out with me than he should have told me in stead of lying and saying that he didn't want to go out with anyone at all. So it is official that I HATE boys. 
I just feel so deppressed. I need to get away from my family and my brothers so badly and just have fun and relax. There is so much more that is going on that I can not put in this. God please just give me a break. I am so sick of it all."

They both did good. Justine got 1st and Kimmy got 3rd. I also went to a carnival with Chelsea. I spent the whole weekend with her. I have never laughed that hard before.

I don't know if I should call that kid, Luke. I hate boys(not), they are so confusing. Well today was a hectic day. I went to the rink at 8 this morning but it was all locked up so I waited in the gym. That was a lot of fun. I finally got in the rink and I had Andrea help me into my dress, and Holly helped me with my hair. Then I skated for an hour. Then I did my make-up and left for Darien. I went with Michael and it was surprisingly not that bad in the car. I skated well I think. I kinda 
re-choreographed a part of my program. And in the beginning my music wouldn't play so the ref called me over. I got 9 out of 10. That sucked especially when I heard the 2nd place girl say that she fell twice and I didn't even fall! But hey all is well. I went to Andrea's office and ate lunch with Tori and Chelsea, and then we went to their house. We watched Crossroads. It was actually pretty good. We had Chinese food and went on the computer. Now I am exhausted! I am goin to chill a little bit and then I am off to bed! 
Bye Yall!
And OMG!!! Are moms supposed to drive you crazy or is that the bonus with all the other bitchy things in life?"

"event","hi everyone! Today was an ok day. I skated 3 hours. I had good axels. I think my axel is coming back from jumping with the kangaroos in Australia(inside joke). My foot work was nice and tight and fast. My camels are getting so much better. I fell really confident with them. I did no off-ice. I had french-fries and chips!! That is really bad. I am really nervous because at the competition tomorrow neither of my parents can come. And Jordan can't come. So Michael is putting me on the ice. And if Andrea can't drive me there than Michael is. That would be really weird. I mean I would be all alone in the car with Michael. What would we talk about? Well maybe I am being paranoid, but I really hope that Andrea can take me.
I met this really cute kid today. His name is Luke. He is 15. He has blue eyes and blond hair. He plays hockey and I gave him my number!! So I am really excited about that. I am so happy that I am finally almost over Zack. I ahve benn his little puppy for way too long.
I am really worried about my brother and his pregnant girl friend. They are just so immature and really not ready for what has just hit them. I just want to ask everyone to keep them in your prayers. REALLY!!! Thank you.
What else is there to say?............ My friend Jessie just got her belly button pierced. I have been thinking of getting mine done. What do you guys think? I think I am too chubby. But I really want to get one. But I would need my parents signature and that would be kinda hard to get. But it would be soo funny to see Dee's face!! lol. Ok well I can't think of anything else to say. 
Wish me luck!!

You see, my brother was out with my and their friends and these guys were starting trouble with them. One of my mom's friend's saw them and she called my mom. My mom ran out of the house and told me to call her if they came home. I was so scared. I called Jessie and was crying. I just kept thinking what if they get killed!!! Well they are all ok. My brother is at the hospital because he got a bee bee stuck in his hand. And my cousin is sleeping like a baby. The whole thing got started because they have big mouths!! lol.

Then we went back to her house and we ate ice cream and watched Monsters Inc. I love that movie! I came home and watched some tv and then I ate dinner with my mom and dad. I walked over to Jessie's because I had her movie and I had to return it. I did not stay long because it was her step-father's birthday. On the way home I saw Zack. If you don't know about him, he is the guy that keeps on breaking my heart. We were talking and he was like flirting with me. That gets me sooo confused because he said that he does not want to be with anyone but yet he flirts like crazy! 
So after that I came home and went on the computer. I am going to go up stairs and sew a little because I really need the money. Then I will probably watch a movie with Chadd and me cousin, E.J. Then I will work out. Ok well peace out. I will talk to guys tomorrow night"

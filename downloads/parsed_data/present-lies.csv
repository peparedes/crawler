"event","Well, well, well. Looks like another year has passed and the time has come, once again, to compile my year in review. Well, I guess the first thing to say is that overall, this year sucked. I mean, don't get me wrong, there were some phenominal points in this year and I had a tonne of fun, but when you equate that to the negatives, I really think that this year was a year of maturity and growing on my behalf.

To begin with, the absolute worst of this year was that I lost two relatives: my father, Daniel Mequi Cabatan, and my grandmother, Leah Wilson. I don't know how many people actually know about my grandmother passing away, but if you don't, it happened around the beginning of December about two weeks after I left Saskatchewan (Serena, mom and I went out because grandma was in the hospital, and she jost kept getting worse the minute we showed up). She was always such a strong lady who always cared about how she looked and how she presented herself. Just seeing her deteriorate was so hard and not being able to do anything about it was even harder. That's the one thing I'm grateful for for when my father passed away: I wasn't there to see him in any pain. I don't think I would be able to handle that at all, but at least both my father and grandmother didn't suffer a lot before they passed on, so I should be very grateful about that too. It's just been extremely hard living without them, but I'm managing and a new year means new opportunity and better times ahead.

This past year wasn't entirely bad though. Like I said: there were a tonne of good times and great memories. The year started off with a house party at a friend of Cori's surrounded by all of my closest friends from that circle. After that there was a lot of school and work. I ended up getting kept on at HMV (where I still work) and was trusted with more responsibility. However, as the year went on, I began to grow more and more jaded of my job. It turned form the job I had always wanted ever since I starte dlistening to music into the job that is petty, filled with hypocrisy and while I have amde some really, really close friends through that job, it's just not a desirable place to work anymore. 

Apart from work, Chris and I also moved appartments and Serena and Kieran moved in to join us. This is quite possibly the best living arangement we have had. Everyone was utterly friendly with one another and we all had a great time when we were living together. We had other roomates when Serena and Chris moved out (for Chris, it's only a temporary move), but nothing was as good as when it was the four of us.

Then summer came, and with summer comes a trip of some sort. This year, Kieran and I pulled a road trip out to New Jersey for the Bamboozle festival and turned it into a week long jaunt around the mid-west going to New York and Philidalphia as well. We were going to go to COnneticuit too, but we didn't have the money and ended up heading home early. However, we did find some awesome things. We ate amazing sandwiches in New York (which we're planning a road trip to go and get again sometime soon) as well as stopped at the original Philly Cheesesteak stands in Philly. The other adventure that happene dwas going to Cori's cottage for year 2. This time, Matt Marshall and two of Cori's friends from work ended up coming with us so it was more of a party (as it always is with Matty). Again, it was an amazingly relaxing time with a lot of good food and awesome friends. Oh, and booze. Lots of booze. Sweet. Other than those two times though, I didn't really travel anywhere, which is kinda a disappointment.

The other great thing about this year (like every year) were the shows and music that came out. The highlights of this year had to have been seeing Dragonforce for the first time, going to the Bamboozle festival (not exactly because of the bands but because of the experience) and seeing Grade reunite for one last show. Other than that Mastodon, Saosin, Between the Buried and me/Misery Signals, Spamalot, Wicket the Musical, Paramore, SLAYER!, Brand New and Tenacious D all played amazing shows ans were phenominal to see. There were also a tonne of great cd's that came out this year. The Roots, Hold Steady, Brand New, Mastodon, Strike Anywhere, Saosin, Amon AMarth, Rosesdead, Sydney, Dragonforce, Set Your Goals, Deftones, Enslaved, +44 and awhackload of other bands put out some great, great cd's this year with notable efforts going to Crazy Frog, Paris HIlton and K Fed. Don't worry guys, you'll knock 'em outta the park with your next batch of, um, ""meaningful and moving"" songs.

So, like I stated at the beginning of this, this year was filled with ups and downs, but after typing this all out, there were some really hard times, the toughest I've had to face yet, but I have amazing friends and I've made so many more that are great over this year that it ends up weighing out in the end. So goodbye 2006. You've broken my spirit at times, but I kicked your ass and survivied for another year. Come on 2007. Whachu got!"

"event","Ok, so I'm back online and ready to do a more thorough explanation of what happened this past week.

So my mom, sister and i heard that my grandma was in the hospital for some weird infection a few weeks back. This led to my mom flying out a couple weeks ago and Serena and I flying out last Sunday and getting back last night at 1.

Basically, my grandma has diabetes and thus is prone to infections. So she got a foot infection back in september, she went to the hospital, they gave her antibiotics for it and sent her home right as rain. The antibiotics ended up giving her a bacterial infection called C Dep (or C Def or something along those lines) which basically gives her bad diarrhea and is generally not good. So mom flies out, they send her to the hospital, she gets out on the Thursday before Serena and I arrive and when we do arrive my grandma is obviously different from normal.

Her hair's kinda messed, she doesn't look well and she's slurring her words. So the care nurse comes on Monday and finds out that my grandma can't walk. So we drive to the hospital in Tisdale (about 40 km's away) and she stays over there for a few days. We go out to visit her over the next couple of days and she's slowly deteriorating. Nothing extreme, but we can tell. Then on Wednesday night, my aunt, uncle and cousin Craig go to visit her in the hospital and Craig gets the impression that she's going to pass that night from my mom so he stays the night with her. They end up having to transfer her to Saskatoon (about a 2 hour drive away) for more tests and scans the next morning so he heads off in the ambulance with her.

Serena and I need to catch our flight back to Toronto that night, so we drive in to Saskatoon, meet with Craig and go and visit grandma. When we arrived...Craig said she looked better than what he saw the day before, but to Serena and I she looked like death. She was mumbling very heavily and slurring her words to a point where it was hard to decipher anything, she couldn't move, wouldn't answer our questions sometimes and even take a long time to answer when she did sometimes and also retaining a LOT of fluid in her legs and left side of her body.

What complicates matter more is they found a lump on one of her kidneys when doing an ultrasound. So they need to find out what the lump is and to do that they need to put certain dye's into her body, but in order to do that her kidneys have to be at a certain level (which they aren't) and in order to bring them up to the level they need to thicken her blood...but if they thicken it too much she could have a stroke. They also want to do a spinal tap and a lumbar press (or something like that) but can't because of various other reasons.

The basic gist of this all is that we really don't know how much longer she's going to be alive.

So needless to say, this week was hard. Watching my grandma as being someone who was so full of life and energy and love and was just the happiest and smiliest person you'd ever meet go from that to not being able to move and talk...it hurts. At least she's not in any pain and mo mom's out there to help with stuff...but my mom needs a break and it's tough on everyone.

Anyone who tried to get ahold of me this week, sorry. I tried to get back to you but it's been a lot of phone tag.

So...that was my week. How was everyone else's?"

So we thing this is cool and continue walking. Well, apparently the kitten thought it was cool too because she followed us all the way home. We have named her Manticore and she is going to live with Kieran's mom and dad pretty soon.

How fucking awesome is that? A cat followed us home! She's about 4-6 months (we think) and pretty darn affectionate. We're pretty awesome.

Other than new cat, things are the same. Work sucks, school sucks, girls suck, music is going pretty good. DnD tonight. I'm way too stoked."

"event","If there's one thing I realized over these two days is that I miss going to local shows way more than I miss going to big-ticket shows. With the local shows, everyone's there to just have a great time, in a small envorinment and be a part of a begining. With the big-ticket shows...a vast majority of people are only there because it's the cool thing to do. Case in point: Brand New. It's getting to the point where I feel like an outcast in my own music. I look different from about 70% of the people (I haven't changed the way I look, with the exception of getting clothes that fit better, for 7 years) and concerts are now riddled with drunken fra-wannabe's who don't have any relation to the past or don't even care. Maybe I'm just becoming jaded because the one thing I've invested my most time in is becoming so stale and diluted.

Then I flas over to the Grade show and it immediately gets better by leaps and bounds. There's no hypocrisy, no backstabbing, no anger toward another person for stepping in their ""personal area"", just everyone there for one reason: to send off one of the scenes finest bands with the biggest hurrah to date. It just has a completely different vibe to it...and maybe it's partly me being pretentious, but there's no heart with the music when it gets that big. People just egt into it because it's ""awesome"" and that's as far as the connection goes.

So what's the answer? Only go to local/small-ticket shows? No, that won't do anything for me either, because there are still so many bands out there with heart and their fance reciprocate that. Stop going to shows in general? No, that won't work because music is a huge part of my life and I'll never be able to separate myself from that. Suck it up and stop complaining? No dice...you try and do the same to something you love. The answer is I don't know what I should do. The only sure thing is that more bands that I like need to have reunions so they can feel like Grade did: a bunch of friends, from accross the globe, uniting for one just cause and worshiping a dream. Simple, no?"

Well, things have certainly gone up since my last post. I was in Oakville for the past 2 weeks, but I'm back living in Toronto for the most part, except for weekends.

Thank you to everyone who lent their support over the past 2 weeks. The first week was an extremely difficult time for me and I have no shadow of a doubt in my mind that my friends helped me pull through. The support all of you gave was amazing and I just wanted to thank all of you for being there through either livejournal, e-mail, phone calls or in real life.

My family is doing fine. My mom, sister and I are all practical people so we're getting over it ok. It still hurts sometimes, but for the most part I'm doing VERY well. As for now, I just wnat things to go back to the way they were before all this happened. I know I can't change some things, but I'm referring to everyone's attitude around me. I'm doing fine and if I'm not, you'll know.

This entire experience has given me a huge change in perspective of everything and opened a lot of doors that I never even knew were there before (rest assured, all good ones). All I want is for you guys to come along on the ride.

I'm startled awake after passing out for 7 hours caused by an overnight shift at HMV. Still groggy, my sister stands over me fully-clothed for a battle, at least it seems that way, and saying ""We need to go home, Dad's in the hospital."" You never full expect to hear those words when you just wake up, so it takes a while to set in. Eventually, it all comes down and I'm fully awake and calling in to work. I shower, dress, get a bag together and sit in Serena's room waiting for a ride home. Then it hits.

June 3rd, 2006 5:10 pm.
""WHAT!?"" Is the only thing she says, then a look of horror. ""Do you want to talk to Jonathan?"" she mumbles through a cracking voice and then I get the phone. ""Dad passed away."" in a perfectly calm tone. I can't speak, I can't even think properly. It's a scene out of an extremely bad movie where the plot doesn't assemble quite right and the cast are all c list celebrities. Unfortunately, this is all real and I'm struggling to grasp at words. The moment I find them though, all hell breaks loose and I completely break down...

We still don't know what the cause of death was. He was perfectly fine when he got out of the shower in the morning, then he started complaining that his legs weren't working properly..then a pain in his back that spread from his stomach. An ambulance was called, they arrived shortly, and he was whisked away to the hospital with my mom in tow. That was the last time anyone close to us saw him alive. She arrived and was told that he would be wheeled by the hall in a few minutes for x-rays and that my mom could watch him go bye. He never came. What came instead was a page for her to go to Emergency. He had gone into arrest and they were working on him. Less than 30 minutes later, he was dead. At least he got his wish: to go quickly and without pain.

It feels as though he's just away on a business trip, that he'll be stepping through the door at any minute, completely ready to BBQ some sausage or steak, or just talk with a beer in hand. That's never going to happen again. Everyone who ever met my dad saw him as the greatest guy in the world. Always friendly, charming, full of life, smiling and one of the nicest guys anyone could have befriended, there wasn't a single person who didn't like my dad. He was also one of the smartest people I knew. Always knew where the best little italian or chinese restaurants were, the best driving route to take, what to do when you're sick, how to help with any school related problem and always with a laugh and smile. He was just a stellar guy.

It still hurts, and I know this isn't going to go away anytime soon. But I'll always remember him and he'll never be forgotten as long as I live. Dad, you were the best person in the world and I'll always love you.

8. Name three things (mentally/emotionally) you look for in someone: Sense of humour, Intelligence/Wit, Not a Bitch/Whore/Retarded (all used in the slang terms, for those of you who are too pc for my journal. Wait, who am I kidding? Fuck those people!)
9. Biggest turn offs include: Really bitchy people and people who take life too seriously. Come on people, do what you want and you'll be happier.
10. Your ideal date would be: Just constantly having a really awesome time and laughing with each other throughout the entire thing.
11. You want to get married, where, when, how: Somewhere awesome? Psh. I don't even know what I'm going to do past next year. Come on, give me a break.

CIRCLE SEVEN: THE FRIENDS
(of your friends, who would you say is:)

3. The funniest: Chris, Kieran, Derek (he always wins at faces)
4. The one you spend the most time on the phone with: Hahaha...Claire. Crazy Brit.
5. The craziest (but in a good way): Kieran man. That guy's ridiculous and I'm going along for the entire ride wether he likes it or not.
6. The most honest: Anyone who I go to for advice usually gives me the honest answer. They're awesome that way.
7. The purest: Yeah, I'm going with Jewel or Dan. All my friends are fuckign tainted. Hahahaha.
8. The smartest: Kass, Kieran (for street sense and people skills), Cassie, Derek, Chris, Jay Cokerill...let's just say a lot of my friends are brighter than I am.
9. The most athletic: Barry. Guy's a fucking NINJA!

The game: once tagged, you must write 6 weird things/habits about yourself, and then tag 6 more people. Those 6 people must write about 6 weird things/habits in a blog about themselves, and tag 6 more people. Tell the people they have been tagged.

1. I've growm more partial to playing air drums than guitar ever since Trainwreck by Boys Night Out came out.
2. Despite my demeanour I do have confidence in my abilities.
3. I'm developing a nervous habit of biting the skin around my nails and I have a nervous habit of rapidly making my leg bounce on the ball of my foot.
4. I can stick my entire fist in my mouth...I have a big mouth.
5. If I don't like something I physically can't do it. My mind won't retain the information.
6. I have an unhealthy appetite. Meaning I'll eat almost any free food if someone puts it in front of me. There are only a VERY few select foodstuffs that I will not eat.

"event","Alright, time to do something a little different this summer. I'm going to try to do some reading and writting this summer. Specifically, I want to start up doing cd reviews and maybe work on a novel or series of short stories. As for the reading, here's the list that I want to tackle:

- The Da Vinchi Code

and works by:
- Nietzsche
- Dostoevski
- Kierkegaard
- Sartre
- Lao Tze

Apart from this, I also want to try either finishing my concept album or doing something with the band. All of this while doing school. Should be an interesting summer. Here's hoping I can stick to it all."

"event","As your walking home from a horrible night, you have a conversation. It could be with a friend, an acquaintence, a relative, a random person, an animal, anyone who will just take the time to listen to you. That's when you get the feeling. You won't notice it at first, but in hindsight it was there form the very first word. You talk about love, happiness, music, friends, anything, but it's always in the back of your mind. You finally get home, sit down, collect your thoughs...and then it fully hits you. It could be something someone said to you online or something that triggered it, but it's there now. You get the feeling that some thing's in this world aren't right no matter how hard you focus on them or wish them to be right, they never will be. You can even focus on the exact moment where the item in question began to turn sour. It was an event. No, it was a call. No, it was an end. No, it wasn't a goodbye. It was nothing at all. Something vanished. 

Then there's another change. Anger sets in, and you can't direct it. Everything else flashes out of your mind, and you're left with a frown, a furrowed brow, a fist, anything mental that you can throw against the wall. You question god, fate, stars, friends, work, music, anything to grasp what happened. Yourself. You pine, and the shit fan turns your way. Everything boiled down to you and you fucked it up. It was easy, simple, covert, minor and you fucked it up.

...Then, if you're quick enough, you'll catch it. It'll twist again into something completely new and you'll realize that it's happened before, it happened now and it'll happen again. How you deal is what separates us from literally being crying sacs of shit. Then images flash through your mind...

- You were walking home. It was snowing. There was no traffic. You just stood in the middle of the street listening to the wind or the snow. It was beautiful.
- You were sitting in Pizza Pizza letting your digestive system work on the pepperoni in your gullet. An anecdote about milk was said. You snickered and said you don't care as you down your chocolate milk like you're 5 again. You're drained, your disappointed, but you're happy because things can only go up.
- You leave your place of business as a wretched shadow of yourself. You're in an even worse state because you have to go out of your way to do something you'd rather put off. You arrive at your destination, tired, annoyed, partially lost. You're greeted, you exchange words, you exchange performances, you leave. Then your companion cracks a comment and you burst into laugher because you realize how true to the movies situations like your life are.


You stumble in after a snowy night of horrible outings and bad pizza. You were rerouted on your trip home, but it doesn't matter right now. You crave sleep, you crave a new day and a new canvas to make your mark and forget about the horrible mistakes you've left on the old one. Then, something snaps you out of it. It could be an e-mail, a note, a word, a look. It  makes you smile, maybe makes you blush. You then think that it's nights without any silver lyning that sometimes, at the end of it, make you look back on the past and realize that the past's events are trivial in the whole of things. You have them, then they're gone. How you choose to remember them is what turns them into material to include in your memoirs."

"event","Ok, so I figure it's about time to start this thing up. Chris is leaving for the summer to move back in with his parents (like he did last summer). So, Kieran, Serena and I are in dire need for a new roomate starting on the 10th of May and going until the end of August/beginning of September. The rent runs about $500 a month along with Cable/Internet (about 25-30 a month) and Hydro (about the same every 2 months). Considering you move in at around the 1/3 month mark, you'd only be paying about 2/3's of a months rent for the first month. Also, your room is what is considered the ""living room"", so that means 24/7 access to the tv/gaming systems (if you want to sleep or something, just tell us to leave, and we will...we're pretty easy going roomies). Chris also leaves his bed and desk in the room, so you won't have to worry about bringing those along. It's a single bed, but is very comfortable. Finally, I know I've met most of the people on my journal, but I have to know you and have hung out with you if you are gonna move in. Friends of friends usually are sketchbags, and we don't want that (may consider it if we're desperate). So yeah, if you're interested, respond here and we'll work something out."

Also, apparently Say Anything is ALSO coming to town on the 18th of May...God DAMN!!! Another show I really need to go to. Why is all this awesomeness happening?

So let's run down the show's so far:

- Armor For Sleep w/ Boys Night Out, Chiodos, Action Reaction, Fri March 10th
- The Bled w/ Protest The Hero, Since By Man, As Friends Rust (I think???), Fri March 24th
- Dragonforce w/ Protest The Hero (Possibly), Fri April 28th
- The Bamboozle Festival w/ a SHITLOAD of bands, Sat/Sun May 6th
- Say Anything w/ ???, Thurs May 13th

"event","So we finally had our housewarming party, and it was some kind of radical!

I had to work during the afternoon, so I managed to show up at the party at 10...with a 3'x3' Coheed and Cambria cardboard poster. When I did show up, there were a decent amount of people in the house, but nothing spectacular...then it started to get more packed. I think when all was said and done, there were asbout 50 people in the house along with a healthy supply of alcohol. It was a fucking awesome party though. So many people that I'm happy came out and everyone seemed to be having a phenominal time (except for those people sitting in the hall...anyone know their deal???). I'm not saying a party like that will happen any time soon again, but who knows? Thanks to everyone that came out and made it a ridiculously amazing time.


Finally, I've begun to grow wary of typing in this journal. I notice that I barely ever update, and when I do, it's really nothing special. I only check it to see what's going on inside my friends minds and that's about it. So...this may be gone soon...or I may just update more regularly when I'm bored in the summer. Who knows.

That is all."

"event","So Chris and I finally have the internet, a couple of new roomates, new stompin' grounds, a wicked weekend and a veritable BEVVY of new information for y'all to grasp. Ready? HERE WE GO!!!

The biggest news is that Chris and I are almost done moving into our new appartment (which I am currently typing from). Both of our rooms are set up, as is Serena's room (the 4th roommate that we got) and Kierans has yet to be finished. It's pretty fucking killer. There's mroe space in general, although we all had to sacrifice a bit of space for our rooms, but we get windwos, easier movement of objects in and out of the appartment, a bigger kitchen and a fucking PORCH! So all in all I think we got a pretty sweet deal outta this. Plus, Kieran has an x-box that we're going to mod to have all the N64 and SNES games on it. This rules!

The next big bit of news is that we got a fucking JAM SPACE!!! It's on Dufferin/Dupont and is in the rehersal factory. We're going in on it with possible 14 people, and it'll only cost around 60 bucks a month. It's secure, big, will have wireless internet along with webcams, shows, pro gear rentals, recording facilities and day rooms. REALLY awesome. This is the kick in the pants that we need to get the full band together and rock the FUCK out! I'm so stoked.

Also, this weekend was Dave's birthday party. Chris and I headed over at around 9:30, and were the only people there (save the housemates). Slowly, people started showing up and around 11 the party was packed. I saw so many people that I didn't expect to see, and had a fucking awesome time. Saw Ashleigh, Gwyn, Kayla, Shane, Skeletor, Emilie, Krista, Jesse, Ty, Thea...fuck...SO many people. It was a pretty rad time. I miss huge parties like that where I'm having a phenominal time and everyone's fuckign awesome.

This week is going to be pretty hectic though. I gotta move a bunch of stuff from the basement still, as well as study for a midterm, work, and find time to hang out with various friends. Oh well...time to buckle down."

"event","Ok...so the upstairs appartment in my building just opened up. Chris and I need one more roomate to split this 4 bedroom apartment with us. There are 4 decent sized rooms (2 are bigger than my bedroom, and 2 are about the size of Chris' room [roughly...10x14 and 8x10 respectively]), bathroom with bathtub, sizable kitchen and a porch. There are 4 locks to get into the actual appartment spanning over 2 doors, and Chris and I have never had a problem with safety. The rent would be 2000 + internet/cable and possible hydro, so split between 4 people, it won't be more than 550.

Chris, Kieran (the other guy who we'd be moving in with) and myself are awesome roomates who are really easy to get along with. If you're interested, I need to know as soon as possible considering it's gonna go on the market within the next couple of weeks.

I know it's a rough time for students and everything, but the appartment is located on Harbord and Major, 5 minutes away from UoT campus, 10 minutes away from the subway and is in the heart of Toronto. This is a phenominal deal for an appartment of this size and location. Please let me know ASAP if you would like to move in with us."

"event","Well, well, well...Seems like 2005 has been kicked out the door, and I'm here, in 2006, wich school looming tomorrow...all is calm. What a perfect time for an update! But no, this shall not be any regular update. This is the year-in-review, happy-birthday-lj update!

Ok, so this past eyar was quite an eventful one for me. I'll try to recollect it as accurately as I possibly can. So school was kinda lack-luster. Same old school, just different courses, professors and students in the classes. I wasn't able to get the marks to get into film studies...and I could care less. Film and I do not mesh in a school atmosphere, so it's all good. So I focused more on the English in my life, and knocked out a few of my required courses. We'll see how poli-sci goes this year, but Astronomy was pointless and I got the science credit.

Furthermore, the possee valentines day dinner took place, we made the possee movie part 2, I think I had like...2 girlfriends throughout the year? And my social life was pretty kick-ass.

This summer what pretty amazing. I had a pretty awesome job in the summer. I cleaned some windows, worked with some awesome people, and we spent our tip money on a PHENOMINAL night out at the end of the summer. THEN, I hosted an incredible Canada Day party at my parents house in Oakville, complete with Fireworks, a REALLY drunken Cassie, TONNES of friends, amazing food and a mother who will put up with all of this. Lastly, at the end of the summer a bunch of us made it out to Cori's cottage and had a killer weekend. There was bridge jumping, tubing, drinking, campfire jam sessions, hilarious times overall. So even though I didn't have TOO much of a vacation this year, and that kinda bummed me out, I did have a really good summer. It was eventful, and I had a stellar job.

Also, there were a lot of people that I me this year. DEREK! It's kinda weird that I met this retard last January, but since then he's grown into an awesome friend who can slay my ass at guitar ANY day of the week (no, I will NOT stop hyping you up...you deserve it). GWYN! I met you this summer...and I already hate you! No, that's a lie...but you HAVE become such an awesome friend...and you have Derek to thank for that. KASEY/SHANE/ADAM/JAMES BROWN! This house is full of amazing people who are fucking amazing to party with. Pretty much one of my favorite places in Toronto. LINDSAY KOBZICK! ""JON CABATAN!"" *jon looks at people who he doesn't know, and gives them a weird look*...the end. KIERAN/MATT! Two people who never fail to lighten my mood with their antics and band ideas...we will tour...oh yes... AXA!!!!! You crazy idiot! BE AROUND MORE!!!

Now for the music...I went to a lot of decent concerts this year, which I will now lay out for all of you:
Bright Eyes, Fall Out Boy (twice!), Matchbook Romance/Motion City Soundtrack/From First To Last, All Ameriocan Rejects, Mars Volta, The Get Up Kids, Story Of The Year/Anberlin, Belvedere, From First To Last/He Is Legend, Warped Tour, Boys Night Out (2 phenominal shows), With Passion...wow...lots.

Apart from the shows, a bunch of other things happened regarding music. Through some weird twist of fate, I met the fine folks in With Passion, saw them twice and they stayed at my place. Such incredible guys, and I'm immensely happy that they have not broken up, but have just incorperated new members and will come back here as soon as they can. Then, possibly two of the most important bands in my life decided to throw in the towel: The Get Up Kids and Blink 182. Blink pretty much got me into punk music, and all the music i listen to today, and GUK was the first emo band I ever listened to, and opened my eyes to a whole new genre that really affected me at the time. It's sad that it had to happen...but I'm glad it happened when it did, and not when they're too far over the hump to redeem themselves.

My musical tastes also changed a LOT over this past year. I'm now into a lot more metal and harder music, and can appreciate the technical merit of a lot of bands, where as last year I was into the same type of stuff: screamo. I've definitely grown as a musician, and hope to push this even farther and be 10 times better next year. I guess that'll be a resolution then?

If you've been following my LJ for this past year, you should have noticed a trend. I've gotten a lot more dull over this past year and also cared a lot less about this piece of e-garbage. Also, I have an inkling that I've beocme a lot less eloquent too. It's never good to feel that your memory is slipping away and you're only in your 20's. I'm going to try to fix that part, but it may be a long, downward spiral from here. As for the boring lj updates...I don't know what to do. I guess I just don't care as much as I used to.

The last part to this story that I'll mention is my work situation. Near the end of thie year I was able to obtain a job that I have been fighting for for years...a job working at HMV. I eventually was able to get on as a Christmas temp with my good friend Derek, and proceeded to befriend all the staff at HMV, and be known as ""Dragons"". I worked there for about 2 and a half months, having a blast the entire time (I actually think this is the first year where I was excited to wake up at 4:30 and work boxing day), and just  having hilarious times with my co-workers. Then Christmas passed, and slowly all the temps were fired off. Derek and I wer eunsure about where we would stand among the other temps, because we had both made phenominal impressions on the staff, but we didn't know if they were going to be able (or even wanted) to keep us on. Well, after 2.5 months of working at HMV as temps, and being the last 2 surviving temps working in the PUMA section...Derek and I were granted part-time status at HMV, and will continue to grace that place with our presence. FUCKS YA!

So all-in-all, this year was amazing. Lots of new friends, lots of amazing shows/music, a few down points...but the good DEFINITELY outweighed the bad."

Christmas was pretty rad. Got an awesome block of knives, baking pan, cool nightmare before christmas calendar, money, gift certificates, and tonnes of love.

Now, I pass out...and have to wake up in 5.5 hours to work. Please, for the love of god, do NOT go shopping tomorrow. If I see anyone I know walk into HMV tomorrow, I will personally castrate you for being a dumbass.

Oh god...tomorrow is going to suck hardcore...wish me luck.

"event","How come this thing turned into something I never update??? I remember when I wa supdating this thing like...3 times a week. Then it was once a week...and now it's barely ever. WHOA! Get BACK on that ball Jon Dragons Cabatan!

So ya, I don't know if I mentioned it...but that's my nickname at work. Dragons. I got it because I was wearing my converge hoodie to work one day, and one of the supervisors (Stu, who also hired me) saw me through the security camera and thought it was a dragon on the front of my hoodie (it's actually a heart with wings)...so he started calling me Dragonboy. Then, Barry (the buyer for PUMA) corrected him, shortened it to Dragons, and it's been like that ever since I started. So that's that story.

Also, last ngiht was Stu's birthday bash. So I went out, and there were a lot of awesome people from woork there. Barry and Steph (another temp, like myself) bought me drinks because I'm poor as sin, and then I lost track of them before I could thank them. So I got good and tipsy, mingled with a lot of the work crew and made my way out of the part at around 1 because I needed to make some meatloaf for lunch. I'm an awesome dude.

Other than that, nothing's really been happening. I work like a whore, finished all my christmas shopping and have been pretty much either going home or hanging out with Kieran/Matt on my off hours. Awesome.

OH! When I went home the last time, I saw a whackload of old people! Dan, Cait, Head, Jenn Sterling, Jeff Arnold, Rudie Shanahan, MArk Turnbull, Danny Walker, Jamie Pick, Candice Welsh, Kate Harper, Andrew Birtch, Brian, Graham...probably shitloads more that I'm forgetting. I went out to the Niblick with Graham, Brian and Birtch, and all of a sudden EVERYONE I haven't seen in ages shows up. What a weird night.

Also, last week I ended up seeing Boys Night Out and The Full Blast with Kieran, Matt, Julian, Max and AQSA!!!I haven't seen that girl in AGES! We had plans to go and see a movie, but I scored tickets to that show from Amanda and took Aqsa for her birthday. I had to majorly convince her at first, but it was worth it, and we both had a wicked time.

So overall, I've been pretty much working and nothing else. When I'm not working, and no one's around, I sit at this computer and am a lazy ass, or I play guitar. So...ya. That's my tiny update before christmas. This next work week is going to kill me...so everyone do me a favour and stay AWAY from shopping places on boxing day. I swear, if ANYONE comes into HMV when I start my shift, I will question their sanity. Fucking hell...wish me luck guys.

PS. GWYN!!! Come home so we can party...party LEGALLY!
PPS. Christmas is in 2 days...whoa. Merry Christmas everyone!"

"event","Whoa nelly! This thing hasn't been updated in a coon's age! Oh man, so much stuff has happened, I don't even think I can remember it all! Well, here we go.

Looking back on my entries, I cannot BELIEVE I didn't talk about the Dillinger Escape Plan show! Holy god what an intense show. HORSE The Band started off the night, and they were hilarious as always. I had such a stellar time watching them...although, a lot of their songs are the same. It kinda makes them boring. Oh well. Then Between The Buried And Me came on. Jesus...H...Christ...This band floored me. They are probably the most boring band to watch live, because all they do is stand there. HOWEVER, Giles COMMANDS the stage, and with the technical ability of that band, it's easy to see why they stand around. Honestly, probably one of my favorite bands now. Hella came on next, and I wasn't too impressed by them. So we will just move on to...DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN!!! Oh man...so good. Such a crazy band to see live. If you guys ever get the chance, you have to see DEP. Your life won't be the same without it.

Other than that, I've been working a decent amount. Probably going to enquire about getting my schedual adjusted and working mroe hours. It'd be sweet if I could get around 35+ hours per week over my break. I really want this job.

Speaking of the job, on the 20th there was a staff meeting for all the HMV staff. Derek and I went to it, sat around, whatever. The part that's interesting comes after the meeting. Derek and I leave with Jay Cockrell and head to the library (which is a bar on Dundas). We meet Jay's girlfriend, and a bunch of the other staff start to pile in. We then proceed to get SMASHED. It was a ridiculously rad time. Everyone was impressed that Derek and I came out, and we got aquainted with the staff more. The I stumbled on a streetcar with Barry, got off at Spadina/College...and...uh...apparently called a bunch of peopel. Hahaha. I'm amazing.

Then, this past weekend, I completed one of my preppy goals. I, Jonathan Cabatan, am now a model. Most of you know this already, cause I've been talking about it for a while. But last Saturday, Cassie and I went down to Touch Lounge on King/Bathurst. Our friend Sansyrae needed models because there was a booklaunch to promote Canada's new top fashion buyer, INDU. What does that mean? It meant that Jon got to wear SWEET clothes by Armani and Yve St. Laurent. It was a really fun time, and Sansyrae said that Cassie and I were  INDU's favorite models (even though ther were professionals there). I told Sansyrae that if they ever need another male model that I'd do it, and she said that they probably would. Go Jon!

Other than that, I've just been working on a lot of schoolwork this week, and trying to start up a few bands. Also, my friend Kieran and I have this cd swap going on. I currently have about 20 of his cd's that he lent me to listen to. New favorite cd's: Every and The Chariot. SO damn good.

Lastly, I'm sorry I've been neglecting a lot of you, my friends. School's so damn annoying, but it will be over soon. Once it's over, I suggest we hang out a lot. Yes? Deal. (ESPECIALLY you Gwyn and Lindasy and Cori and Derek...*stares down*).

Upcoming concerts:
From First To Last and He Is Legend tomorrow
Boys Night Out and Full Blast on the 15th
Panic! At The Disco, The Academy Is and Hellogoodby on Feb 2nd

"event","Today I worked. Jesus...what a spectacle that was. For thos eof you who didn't know, HIM came in to HMV for an insotre autograph signing today. We had like...between 300 and 500 kids there, all wanting a signature. How ridiculous is that? Also, it didn't make it any better that we oly played HIM all day (that cd's gso god damn annoying now), and that after around 200 kids were told they weren't going to get in they stormed the stairs and the store trying to get a picture of the ***GORGEOUS*** Ville Valo. There were a couple higlights though:

1. Girl in like- ""Don't make me cry! I'm already going to cry when I see Ville!!!""
*later on, walking up to Sarah Taylor from Much Music*
*crying*""Oh my gog, Ville!...Wait, are you Sarah Taylor? My dog loves to watch you whenever you're on tv!""
2. Girl with a live snake around her neck...who brings a fuckign SNAKE to a cd store??? What a nutcase!
3. HIM fans in general. Honestly, these people are just ridiculous. Stupid Emo goths.

So ya...that was today. Work wasn't so bad...I was busy and the shift went by relatively fast. I spent most of the day helping Barry set up for the in store, and making HIM jokes with Derek. It was pretty rad.

I just thought you should all know about the hilarity of HIM fans."

"event","Man...So much happened this weekend. I'm still so tired from it all.

Friday started off pretty tame...I busied myself throughout the day cleaning and whatnot. Then I made a stellar casserole for dinner. It was so cheesy and chickeny...wicked sweet! Then Serena came down and we went to a show for her birthday. Belvedere wa splaying on their last tour ever and so were 30 Nights of Violence, The Full Blast and Navy. Navy were pretty awesome live...I've never seen them before and I was quite impressed. The 30 Nights of Violence took the stage. I had never even heard of these Edmontonians...but man can they ever play. Such an awesome metal/hardcore band. I'll definitely check them out again. Then The Full Blast came on. Jesus...that band always blows me away everytime I see them. They did a good mix of Short Controlled Burst songs and Contageous Movement Theory songs. I would have liked to head Distance Between Stars...but I know that was out of the quesstion ebcause they never play it anymore. So after The Full Blast, we leave to go and get some mexican food. After that, we meet up with Cori, Matt, Amanda, Dan and Joanne at Velvet Underground and dance for a bit. That place is pretty decent...I'd return there. Then we left because we were drained, and headed to bed.

On saturday, we woke up around 10 and then headed over to Fran's for breakfast. Man, such good food...I love that place. Then I headed off to work. Work was ok...although Ralph fucked up my shifts...so I need to call him tomorrow and straighten things out. Oh well. During work, Leo invited Derek and I out to a party he was having that ngiht. So when I finished work, I met up with Lindsay at Spadina station, headed back to my place, drank a bit and watched some Harvey Birdman, then headed back to HMV to meet up with Derek and Gwyn. We head on over to Ossington and then walk over to Leo's. He has a pretty nice set-up of a house. We meet all his friends, and have a fuckign AWESOME time. Leo also has some turn tables in his basement that he's quite proficient with. There was even a freestyle battle. Man...so fucking wicked. To top it all off, I made stellar drinks for Lindsay and myself. Oh man did they ever rock (one looked like ectoplasm). So at around 4, we leave Leo's and head on over to Mel's for some wings and poutine. Then we go our separate ways and end up crashing at around 5.

Today I woke up, led Lindsay down to the train station, ate some Harveys and met up with Derek in hopes of getting some research done for our Sci-Fi papers due on thurs...unfortunately, the research section of the library is closed on sundays, so instead we went back to Derek's and watched Land of the Dead. I was pretty impressed with it. 

Now I sit here, bored out of my mind, and after having been stood up by this guitarist for a second time...I find myself doing nothing. Was a crappy end to and otherwise phenominal weekend. Ah well."

"event","Alright, it's time for a real update for a change. This weekend has been pretty awesome overall. Albeit, friday was the only really stellar day, it wasn't SO bad overall.

Friday started off by me polishing up an essay and handing it in. I was actually surprised how little time this essay took to write. It was for my Poli Sci course, and anyone who knows me knows I DISPISE political science. So if I get a decent mark on that, maybe I won't have too much to worry about. So after that, I spend the rest of the day running around doing errands. I gather the last part of my costume, get some alcohol, go home and do some dishes, make some meatloaf and then Matt came over and we got ready to head on out. My costume turned out fucking amazing! I dressed up as Principal Scudworth from Clone High, and everyone who knew who I was loved it. So Chris, Matt and I get to the fort around 9:30, and there's pretty much everyone that the fort knows mutually in their kitchen. There were some pretty rad costumes too. Chris Payne was a fucking greaser, Ty was a flasher, Cori's paper bag princess turned out good, and Matt's costume ruled. Good ideas this year. So people start to show up, and it turns into a really awesome party! I didn't get to talk to a lot of people overall, but I made the rounds a bit. So after a bit of time, Kieran and I head out to Bloor with a bunch of people. I meet up my friend Jackie briefly and talk like a drunken moron, but hey...it's halloween. Then we head on off to Mel's diner where I proceed to get gravy all over my lab coat. AWESOME! Then I pretty much just stumble home and pass out. Such a rad party.

Saturday was work...not too much happened there, except Derek: apparently we're the only two good people they hired. Everyone else is an idiot. Awesome! Work was surprisingly boring for a saturday. I didn't sell too much, and spent the majority of the time sorting out the punk section. Oh well. After work I was too tired to go out with the fort, so I met Kieran and his Friends Matt/Cas at Futures and we chilled there. Then I went home and looked at Penny Arcade comics.

So ya...that was my weekend so far. Life's been really awesome lately. I think I'm the happiest I've been in a few months...which is really good. There's no realy drama in my life anymore, and I've sorted everything out with Cassie, so we're on great terms again. My friends are as awesome as always, I'm not stressed out over anything, I'm just really in a good spot. ALSO! I've gotten my ambition to play guitar back! How stellar is that! I've been writting a few things for this band that Kieran, Julian and I are staring up. It's (hopefully) going to be a fun experiment. Here's hoping we find a second guitarist and a bassist (if ANYONE knows anyone who'd like to play in a fun band, let me know). So ya...that's all that's really be going on in my life. I wish that I were able to hang out with certain people more...but that's not necessarily my fault. So ya.

As a final note: my cousin Keith is coming over to visit from December 28 - January 6th. He'll most likely be staying with me starting on the first. If people know of something to do (I have a few ideas, but nothing concrete yet), let me know. I want to show him as much of Toronto and my friends as possible (considering this is the farthest he's ever travelled before, I want to make it really awesome for him). So ya...you'll all probably get to see him when he's here...he's probably the cousin I'm the closest with.  Lastly, we assume that the fort is doing something for New Years. We're going to that."

"event","So today was my actual first day of work (for those of you who don't know, I got a job at HMV on the PUMA [Punk/Urban/Metal/Accesspry] floor). This job is seriously one of the coolest I've ever had. The people are amazingly awesome, and it has potential to evolve into an ACTUAL job (fingers crossed that I make a good impression on them and the keep me on). 

So I worked from 12-9 today with a 1 hour lunch inbetween. It's kinda nice, caus eit's a full 8 hours (minus the lunch which isn't paid for), and even though I'm getting paid shit it still evens out because hopefully I'll get a decent amount of shifts per week. It's really laid back, and as long as you're helping customers and doing a decent job of keeping busy, they don't really care. Really awesome. Derek: how did your first day go?

Other than that...I've been feeling kinda blah. I'm stuck in this mental cycle...and I just want out. I have been hanging out with some really fucking awesome new friends I made and just generally been surrounding myself with awesome people (who are all my friends). I dunno...I guess the one good thing is that I've kinda gotten my motivation back and want to play guitar more. So...I dunno. I guess it's just that time of year, eh?

I'm aslo just getting over the sickness I've had since I made my last entry. It's down to a cough and a runny nose...I should be better come monday (hopefully).

Now I'm off to bed...this entire night I thought it was friday...I think I really do need sleep."

"event","So last night marked day 3 (the final day) of the Converge tour. Holy...god! What a way to end it all.

So at around 5:30ish I head down to Tyler's place to nab some food with him. We go over to Tortilla Flats, I get some fajitas, we split a pitcher, then we pay our bill and split over to the Opera House (taking a street car...because it's fucking far).

So we get there, meet Gwyn in mine (I was surprised to see her right near the beginning of the line). Then, considering we wanted to feel special, we surpass the line and enter into the front doors with our all access passes. We wait around for Crossley and Gramlitch inside for a bit, meet up with them, then doors open and everyone files in. So we're standing around for a while, each having a couple of drinks...then we get bored and decide we want to be elite again, so we all head backstage. So we talk to a few of the guys in Mare, Cursed, Terror and Converge...then we spy the food and booze and proceed to help ourselves.

Then we hear the call for Mare to get on the stage so Crossley, Ty and myself proceed to head on up. Mare...dear lord...They blew me away again. Such an incredible band...and their music is extremely simple. Not really complex, just whistful...and ethereal. So incredible. Also, every member of this band is extremely nice. I talked to Tyler for a while and he's a really cool guy. Look forward to catching these guys mroe in the future.

After Mare, Cursed took the stage (as per usual). Such an incredible band. So much energy, and their drummer's awesome to watch (he even had a busten finger still!). Probably wouldn't go to a show just for them again...but if they wer eplaying with some awesome people, I definitely would.

After Cursed, Terror went on...however, around this time the promoter wa sinformed that Crossley, Ty and I were drinking the band's booze. So we were told to stop...and instead, the three of us pitched on a jug of wine-cooler (which we hid in an alley, and drank during Terror). Thus, we missed Terror...but got drunk for relatively cheap!

Finally...Converge. Sweet JESUS this band's incredible. Last night's set was probably 10 times better than the night before (in my opinion) and the crowd went NUTS for it. Hearing the Saddest day for one last time was amazing too. I hope this band comes back next year...they've definitely become one of my favorite bands to see.

After the show, Crossley, Ty and I headed back home...except I went to Ty's and met up with Chris Payne and Brad. We got bored, and decided to go for a tour. So we head on over to Spadina and grab some street meat. Then we get the brilliant idea that we should head on over to the CN Tower...so we do. We walk down there, over along Blue Jay Way, and head accross the path that runs along the Sky Dome. We encounter these two guys in the middle of a fight, and decide that now was not the best time to be sticking around. So we head out of there, enter the skywalk...realize a lot of the exits are locked, then head over to Planet Hollywood. Now, outside Planet Hollywood they have this replica of the outside of Mann's CHinese Theater (where all the celebs put their hands in the cement). We honestly spent 30 minutes just comparing our hands to everyone elses. So incredible. After this, we decide to head back home. So we walk up Bay street...and encounter snow. We were weirded out...but Brad grabbed some and starting running back home with it. We ask some guy why there's snow there and he told us it was from a movie they were filming. After we told Brad this, he got super pissed and smashe dhis show on the ground. We reach Town Hall, sit down near the fountain for a bit while Payne has a hotdog, and talk about various things we've encountered along our ways. After he finishes his hot dog (and makes an extreme mess all over the sidewalk), we continue to walk along Queen. We stumble across this construction site with a bunch of HUGE ""The Warriors"" posters posted on them. Brad proudly proclaims how he'd love one of those...and we here ""Well, you want one?"". We turn around to see this truck piled with posters, and these 2 guys putting them up. They give Brad one of each poster, and let us go along on our merry way. We walk Payne home, wake up Thea, grab my hoodie and head back over to the Fort. Then Brad an I part ways and I go home.

...However, once I get home, I can't sleep and am thinking a thousand thoughts a minute. Luckily Brad is the same way, so we dicide to go on another tour for a bit. We start to leave...when Brad realizes he has gumballs that we should eat. We grab the gum, head out and happily begin to chew. We walk all around the Annex (Brunswick, Major, Dominion, the Tennis courts south of Dominion...everywhere)...all the while chewing this insanely sweet gum. We stop at a grocery store along bloor, where Brad buys hickory sticks and I get...2 figs. Hahahaha...I still can't believe I bought figs. After this, we head on home...freak a lady out when we ask to pet her dog...then split ways. I enter my house, sit down, think a lot again...and pass out at around 5:30.

Wow...that was such an insane night. Thanks to Chris Gramlitch and Crossley for getting my that pass so that I could witness the phenominal tour (and not for just one night...for THREE!), thanks to Chris Payne and Brad for making last night be one of the best nights I had in a long time, thanks to everyone else who tolerated me and was also up last night to talk to me.

Last night made me realize that right now I am living the life I always wanted. I'm happy, not attached to anyone/anything, in an amazing city, have the best friends a guy could ask for and am just overall in a really good place. So thank you to everyone who helps with that. The past three days have been amazing. 

Thank you once again...That is the story of my Tri-day Converge Tour."

"event","So, tonight marked the second installment of the Converge tour (Taking place in Hamilton).

The drive actually went off without a hitch. We stopped at Lick's in Oakville again and I proceeded to get the same meal I got the ngiht before: steak burger, onion rings, cherry coke. However, this time the guy serving me had a hard on for whipped cream and wouldn't leave me alone. I told him off forcefully and that was that.

So we get to the Underground, enter...and proceed to wait.

Then Mare takes the stage. Man, these guys are growing on me each night I see them. Such a solid band live, and despite their iPod failing and forcing They Sent us to have an acapella beginning, they put on an incredible set. I just wish more people got into them. Oh well.

Next was Cursed. I didn't enjoy these guys as much tonight because I really couldn't see them. I'm sure they'll put on a better show tomorrow (now that I actually have the nerve to GO backstage and watch from a decent viewpoint).

Third was Terror...oh man...these guys won me over tonight. I spent their set watching them from the backstage area, and wow...such an energetic/good-vibe band. Sure, they're a little rpeachy at times...but it's all positive (they even stopped dead during the middle of a song because a fight broke out...cool guys, good beliefs).

Finally...the moment we were all waiting for...Converge took the stage. Holy fuck, they are the reason this is titled the seduction. I do believe I am in love with their live show. Such an incredible band. I don't know how, but they managed to top last nights performance. Maybe it was the fact that I could see them decently or maybe it's the fact that they're INSANE live (honestly, I don't know how the drummer can pull off his stuff live), but they're phenominal. I really want to pick up their earlier, re-released recordings now and get into them even more. Such an amazing band.

After the show, we had to give Tyler from Mare a ride back to Toronto, so I slept in the trunk of Bertha. What an awesome night, and I can't wait for tomorrow. It's going to be incredible. Everyone come out (and if you get a chance, go and see this tour)!"

"event","So, Yesterday marked the first day on the Converge Tour Roadtrip. For those of you that don't know, Crossley works at Exclaim! magazine and he was able to pull some strings with Chris Gramlitch (I hope I spelt that right...the guy who put on the show/metal writter for Exclaim!) and thus, get Ty and I to come along on a three-day road trip to see Converge, Terror, Cursed and Mare (London, Hamilton and Toronto).

So Last night was the London experience.

I get a call fromC rossley around 3 telling me to meet up with him, Ty and Chris at 3:30 at the Exclaim! building. Now, I'm poor as sin, so I have to walk over there in about 20 minutes (for those of you who don't know, Exclaim!'s on Ossington/Bloor and I'm over on Harbord/Spadina...quite a walk). So I manage to make it over there with about 5 minutes to spare and meet up with the guys. We go to our vehicle that the magazine rented for us and it turns out to be a brown Ford Focus Wagon...the best car to drive to a metalcore show in. So we go along our merry way and as we set off we realize that we want some good music. So Ty grabs a cd form his bag and we put it in the cd player...it doesn't work. We keep trying, but the player doesn't take the cd and we're forced to listen to the radio. We're so annoyed with this that we even try to call the rental place to see if they know how to fix their cd player, as well as calling best buy to see what we can buy to listen to music off an iPod (with hilarious results). Eventually we make it to Oakville, and I suggest that we head on over to Futureshop to get somehting to allow us to play decent music in out car. We grab an iTrip, realize we need to instal software on the iPod first, run in, exchange it for something else and FINALLY are able to have music. Then we go to Licks and get awesome food, finally setting off on the road again around 5 (ya...it took us an hour and a half to get past Oakville...awesome, eh?).

So we get lost a couple times along the way (basically because mapquest is a fucking joke), but eventually make it to the venue with 30 minutes to spare.

Then, Chris unveils our first present: All access passes to the show. How fucking sweet is that!? I felt so pretentious with it...it's awesome. So we sit around a while, I buy some merch (because Converge have AMAZING artwork) and settle in for a little Mare.

Mare are a fucking incredible band to see live. So chill, yet so badass at the same time. They put on a stellar performance and pulled off the songs amazingly well live.

Cursed came on next. I have to say, I didn't know what to expect from them but they really impressed me. Crossley described them as punk but metal...and that's a perfect description (think I Hate Sally). Their drummer was really fun to watch too.

Then Terror came on, and I wasn't too impressed with them. I understand what they're trying to do (the whole ""positive hardcore"" thing...and it's good because it gets kids into a more positive lifestyle), but EVERY song sounds the exact same. It's just ridiculous at points.

Finally...Converge takes the stage. Now, I have to admit that after Terror I was really drained and tired...but holy fuck, seeing Converge live blew me away. They are such an energetic band to see live and put out so much energy to the crowd...which the crowd gives back ten-fold. Such an amazing band and really nice guys too. Lastly...their drummer...HOLY FUCK!!! This guy is a machine. I can't imagine doing that every night. Him and the singer...they both looked utterly floored by the end of the show.

After that we congradulated everyone on amazing sets, piled into our rock-mobile (Bertha, as she's dubbed) and headed on home. All in all, such an incredible night. Even though there were a bunch of hilarious mistakes, night one went off pretty much without a hitch. What will night TWO bring to the table??? The only thing that is certain...is Licks.

PS. I forgot to mention...I got a call last night saying I have a job at HMV Yonge/Dundas. I went in for training, and hopefully will be working throughout the school year. Who knows what they'll do though...I'll probably get canned after New Years. Oh well! I have a job bitches!"

"event","So I haven't done a proper update in a long time. Thus, this post will be one!

Not much has been happening nin my everyday life. School is fine...and in looking at my past posts I haven't even talked about school. So I'm taking 4 courses this semester and 6 nest. This semester it's: Shakespeare (interesting...the prof is really cool), Early Modern Lit (can be interesting at times, but also very boring...kinda like what 20th Century Canadian Fiction was last year), Politics of the Good and Just Society (boring as FUCK! this is going to be my worst class of the entire year, hands down) and Science Fiction and Fantasy (amazing. this coupled with the film component next semester will probably be my favorite courses of uni...they MAY even beat out the LOTR seminar I took in first year). So those are my classes. I almost have all my books. I think I still need to pick up a few for various classes (including a new Shakespeare anthology...cause the one I had was apparently too ""old""...ah well), but it shouldn't be much more. So far I've spent around $450 bucks on books...then next semester I need to buy for 3 more classes. I'm so poor.

As for the job situation, I am currently unemployed. However, I do have 2 interviews on Tuesday (one at HMV on Yonge/Bloor at 10 and the other at the HMV superstore at 3), and I did do some work for Exclaim! magazine this weekend. That was a fucking amazing time. The deal was that Mike needed about 10 people that he could pair off and send to various venues around Toronto to hand out Exclaim! promotional cds. The job lasted from about 12-1:30 in the am from thursday to saturday...so it was about 5ish hours of work in total, and we got paid $110 for it. How is that not sweet? So I got paired with Dan Godwin (from the Fort) and we lucked out and were stationed at Lee's Palace. The first night was ok...not a lot of people, but we got through a surprising amount of cd's for the amount of people there. Then the second night was funny as fuck...mainly because we were both drunk. Then on saturday, it was still ok...but we both just wanted to get out of there and get tanked. So we all went back to the Fort (everyone who did the promotional thig) and at 2 in the morning started to get pinned.

On Friday there was a party that Tim/Derek's house threw...but it was at Gabby's. It was originally going to be sponsored by Jagermeister...but their neighbours are cunts and they had to move it (hopefully the Jag party can happen another time). So Chris and I go down to their house first, then a bunch of us head off to Gabby's. Jon Hembry, Derek and I all had to work that night...but still had an awesome time. I tried to convince Jon to do an Irish Carbomb with me...but he backed out, so I was left to do one by myself. Met (for the second time) and talked to Angela (Dave/Dan's friend) for a while that night, and also talked to a lot of other cool people. Ended up heading off to work at 12ish, and after work had a really awesome conversation with Fort Dan. It was weird...because I didn't expect to have that with him. Still, awesome, awesome night.

Then on Saturday I bummed around for a bit of the day, went out to dinner with Cassie, Tim and Dan (I really need to talk to Tim and Dan more...really, really awesome guys) and then I parted ways with them because they were all going off to various parties and I had to work. Man...such a crazy Saturday night. Like I said, we started drinking around 2...and then a good majority of people passed out around 4. Luckily, Brad, Crossley and I were wide awake. So we decide it would be a good idea to go into Tae's room and wake him up...ass naked. After that, we steal a few beers out of the fridge and stumble accross the street to the park. Crossley climbs up onto the roof, Brad and I have a talk and we drink the rest of the beer. Then we head on over to Mars Food because we're all hungry, and proceed to order and eat. We then stumble back to the Fort, Crossley decides he wants to sleep on the street, and I leave Brad to convince him not to and end up passing out at 6:30.

Then yesterday I went over to my sisters to do laundry, and then headed over to Kasey's to hang out with her. We walked around a bit, watched Super Troopers, walked some more, then I went home.

All in all, this weekend was incredible. Haven't had a REALLY fun weekend in a long time. Talked to a lot of people, and strenghthened a lot of friendships. Thanks to everyone who made this weekend awesome...I haven't had a TRULY awesome weekend in a while.

Now for a quick past update...IN POINT FORM!...
- Bought 3 cd's: A Wilhelm Scream - Ruiner (good...but nowhere near what I was hoping), Coheedn and Cambria - Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness (utterly amazing...takes a few listens to sink in, but once it does it holds on for dear life) and Between The Buried and Me - Alaska (another incredible cd. I never really liked them before, but this cd blew me away)
- Saw a movie at the film festival: It was called The Great Yokai War, and was directed by the same person that did Ichi The Killer. It was rated PG-13, but if any North American kida saw this...they'd shit their pants and have nightmares. It was bout these japanese spirits that need to fight against this demon overlord who's capturing them and twisting them by combining them with machines. It's just as fucke dup as it sounds. The plot made absolutely no sense at times...but if you can let go of that notion and just accept it for a visually amazing movie, you'll be endlessly happy.
- Found my copy of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 for PS...it's all I've been playing
- I need a job and am poor (but I don't need money dad, so don't ask!)
- Got a new cell phone...it's snazzy and can take pictures and videos
- I'm going to see Converge...three days in a row...and Crossley, Ty, a dude form Exclaim and I are going to rent a car (free for ty and I) and drive to London and Hamilton to catch 2 of the shows...my fave is going to explode 3 nights in a row.
- I'm also going to see SOTY, HIL, FFAF and Anberlin...going to be an amazing show.
- I'm not going to With Passion and Cryptopsy anymore...because they are no longer coming. They are in the midst of band changes because all but 2 members left. This saddens me.

That is all...wish me luck, for I am gone."

"event","Well, I haven't updated this in a while...so I'll do a point form one.
- The rest of August sucked. Was paranoid and bored...so fun.
- September hit and nothing was happening
  - Finished window cleaning job...overall a fun time, but sucked so hard nearing the end
  - Helped Cassie move in over a period of 2 days...that was moving
  - Went to a party at the Fort...but had wine and cheese before...good times
  - Some argumentation...some speak of affection...mostly confusion
  - Got drunk off the tip money...awesome night...followed by a horrid day.
  - Hung out with Cassie a lot during this period
  - Slip-ups, confessions and finales...more confusion, but mostly confirmation of paranoia
  - Started a new job cooking food at a cafe...it's pretty cool.
 
Prediction for this week:
- LOTS of hanging out with friends and road trips. Huge distractions before school starts.

So ya. The past few weeks have sucked. Some highlights, but mostly...I feel like shit. It'll be better, it just isn't now...which is what I want. If you're in Toronto, you'll be seeing lots of me...cause I don't want to think.

I promise I won't update this until I'm feeling better. No one wants to read about me being retarded."

"event","So this weekend was one I've been looking forward to for a while: Rockapallooza. Albeit, it was my first one, and apparently it wasn't even Rockapallooza because it wasn't at the Nealon farn...regardless, it was still a rocking time. So, we show up at Rivierra park where it got moved and find out that Stand Falling is set to play second. Man, I think we managed to pull off the best set we've ever done. My guitar sounded like shit (way too trebely and retarded) and I couldn't hear my vocals, but it was still a fucking awesome set. So fun and pretty tight too. There were a tonne of other bands playing too, but I think Kasey and Layne and Coming Home To Traffic Patterns put on the best sets...especially K+L. Honestly, some of the best sounding voices I have heard in a while and their harmonies ALWAYS give me shivers. So amazing. Also, I started talking to Derek and we're going to change Photoplay. We're going to turn it into an ambiend, sludgy, technical, math, videogame metal band. I know that's specified...but picture like massive build-ups (like Mogwai or CHTTP) then going into HUGE sludgy parts into very tech/math parts and just very schiotzophrenic and awesome. Oh ya...and we're going to do like 20-30 minute songs. Very ambitious, but I have a lot of good ideas. I want 3 guitarists in this and 2 drummers, and if we're going to have vocals, I want K+L to do vocal harmonies...just vocal harmonies, no real lyrics. It's going to be incredible if I can get this thing going.

So the show kinda dragged on for me, but it was still pretty awesome. After the show a bunch of people went to Nealons farm and that's where the party took off. There was a small shanty town of tents, and a bunch of AWESOME people. One thing I noticed this weekend is how many people have heard of me, or have met me before...but I have no clue who they are. It was so weird. I was just like ""Oh hey...how do you now me???"". But ya...drank a bit, talked to a lot of people (K+L, Lindzi Kobzick, Hayden O'Niel, Jon Hembry, Rob and Ashley, Chris Harris, Timmay, Emilie [even though she hates me]...a lot of people). I also noticed how much fun I have with people I barely know...like Rob and Ashley and Chris Harris. So fun to talk to and hang out with...just awesome. It was a pretty solid time. I ended up passing out in Ashleys van with Lindzi because we were homeless...and then got woken up by Rob wearing only hit hat over his cock...hahaha. All in all it was a REALLY solid show/after party and I had amazing amounts of fun. Thanks ot Jen + the Nealons + Olie for throwing it, and everyone I talked to for making it awesome. Such a sweet time. Can't wait for next year."

"event","This weekend fuckign SLAYED!!!

So Cassie comes down on Thursday because neither of us have work on Friday, and...uh...fuck, I forget what we did. We hung out...man, my memory sucks.

Anyways, on Friday we did a bunch of errands (went shopping, got her pictures developed, bought booze...the fun stuff), then went back to my place, got pizza, packed up everything, and went down to the Fort with mass amounts of things. Crossley and Lara come to pick her, Brad and myself up, and we go on a 3 hour ride to Cori's cottage. It was annoying cause we had my guitar case sitting across Cassie, Brad and I in the back seat of a 2-door Honda...but when we got there we completely forgot our ride. Such a fucking beautiful place. Then we started drinking, hanging out, and living it up.

On Saturday we went tubing, canoeing, paddle-boating, canoe-pulling-paddle-boat-ing, discovering the island of Jike Cabossley (which is really a peninsula because of a bridge), bridge jumping, tampolineing more drinking, and awesome hanging out. This weekend was perfect, and everyone had an amazing time. The only thing that could have made it even better would be if Matty, Chris and Niki were able to come up. Ah well. Cori said this could become an annual thing, so here's hoping it will be.

Then, after we get back on Sunday, I take Cassie down to the GO station, look at my phone and realize that Krzyzynski called me. I called that fucker back, talked to him for a bit, and as I was wrapping things up with him Airing walks up! Whoa! I haven't seen her in MONTHS. So I convince her to spend the ngiht with me, and we walked back to my palce, got pizza, went to a park, ate said pizza, and layed down in the park just napping and petting dogs that came up to us. So awesome. 

Now I (hopefully) will work this week, get paid, buy a bit mroe booze, then play a show at Rockapallooza on Saturday. It should be an incredible time because I'll be able to see people I haven't seen in AGES (Like Derek, Chris Harris (even though he probably doesn't remember me) and Emilie!). I am uber stoked about all of this. Jon is no longer a sad being. Things couldn't be better for me...unless my job would give me hours and money. Stupid fuckign job."

Dinner with Chris and Cassie on friday.
Went to two parties...both at the Fort...both slightly intoxicated...dead tired on friday.
Taste of the Danforth is no fun when you're poor.
I'm quite poor.
Life is confusing me...but this weekend was fun.
I'm feel off.
Crossley is quitting the band after Rockapallooza.
""Quitting"" being he's doing it part-time.
I need more initiative.
Guess Who is quite a good movie.
Same with Suicide Kings.
I desperately want to go back to school.
This weekend confused me.
I started questioning it...fucking sucks.
This entry was lame.
Cori's next weekend...here's to cottages."

Well, this weekend was an eventful one. To kick things off, I went to Dan's cottage on friday with Dan and Steph...later, his parents, his sister and his sisters friend joined us. We had a pretty chill night, watched some SLC Punk, went out to the dock and jammed on guitar...awesome.

Then on saturday, we all woke up early and left t go to Warped Tour. I think this will be the last year that I'm going to Warped, unless there's some INSANELY amazing bands next year, or it's in Toronto. Barrie's just too much of a hassle. The sound this year was incredible. Probably the bets sound I have EVER heard form Warped Tour...good thing the sound guys finally got a clue. It was insanely dusty, and at times you couldn't even see the main tage because of the dust. The bands were kinda only OK this year...the best acts I saw were: Boys Night Out (INCREDIBLE live...the new stuff is making me really happy), Dillinger Escape Plan (insane live act...makes me love them so much more), Motion City Soundtrack (were playing when we got in, but so fun and perfect live), Sydney (awesome, awesome stuff), Thrice (sub-par live show, but INSANELY tight live) and Saosin (so good live). When we went for merch, Dave Arnold was doing the BNO merch tent and he sold me Trainwreck and a belt buckle for 20 bucks. Yay knowing people!

After Warped, we moved back to Dan's cottage, fell asleep, then I got a rid ehome from Vanessa's (Dan's sisters friend) dad...he drove me to Kipling, where I went back home and met up with Cassie. We watched Anchorman, ate perogies, I shotgunned a Faxe, then we went over to the Fort for a bit of pre-drinking. After about an hour, we went to Adam Beamish's moving out party just up the street. It's insane that he's lived in that house for 4 months, btu I just found out about it 2 weeks ago. Met some cool people, and hung out with Andrew Milne and Beamish the entire night. Fuck, such awesome guys. I missed them. Hopefully I can get into their show for free on Thursday like they said. I'll call Beamish this week to confirm. Then Cassie and I left, and passed out. All in all, quite the fun weekend.

Back to work tomorrow...W00T!!! I'm so poor...and I haven't showered today...yummy."

"event","NIN&nbsp;was freaking awesome. Out of the two shows I have seen this one was my favorite. Lots of older songs, and some more mellow stuff. Very fun, ran into pretty much everyone at the show as well.<br /><br />I&nbsp;brought my camera and shot some 500 pictures. This show marked my 10,000 photo, and the D50 has been great. A few dead pixels are starting to show up which is sad. Anyways here are a few teasers, ill try and upload the better ones tomorrow.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/3532439147_88512be078.jpg"" /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3633/3532440525_d4282313a1.jpg"" /></div><br /><br />"

Aesthetic Perfection almost stole the show, and :sitd: was really good. Imperative put on the best show I have seen of theirs to date. I liked the added live drums and guitar.<br /><br />Between Nida and myself we bought all the Aesthetic Perfection CD's, the new IR cd, the new Diverje cd, and two hoodies and a shirt. &nbsp;Good thing I saved up for the show.<br /><br />Go vote TODAY&nbsp;if you have not yet.<br /><br /><br />Ted from IR<br /><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/alphawolf260/pic/00005wpd/s320x240"" /><br /><br /><br />Gabe from IR, Mindfield, Ionnokx, and 50 other bands ;)<br /><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/alphawolf260/pic/000066d3/s320x240"" /><br /><br />Diverje and IR<br /><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/alphawolf260/pic/00007pq4/s320x240"" /><br type=""_moz"" /><br />"

Also Trent updated NIN.com with just the text ""two weeks."" Last time he did this he released an album (Ghosts). Is Trents five year long, drug filled, depression induced hiatus' between albums finally over for good ? Are we going to get a new NIN album every other month ?! Im so excited !"

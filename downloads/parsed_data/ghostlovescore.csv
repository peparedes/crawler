"event","First post in an LJ. woo! Lol.

Anyway..It's always weird starting a new journal cause you never know what to write..I wonder if I can use thei app to update my DJ too..hmm..

Anyway, today is boring. Lastnight we didn't get in from Claire's birthday till about 12 and we went to bed at about 3, so i'm still kinda. Not to mention that at Claires party, there were those little annoying things that run around and jump on you and try to punch you..what are they called? OH! kids! There was Thomas and Claire and Alex. Alex is only two, and she's the most adorable toddler I have ever seen. She's half japanese, sonce her mother is japanese, but her father is british, so the poor lass has got a mixture in her! Thomas and Claire, however..Thomas first of all decided to sit on my knee and bounce up and down, then it turned into a punching and kicking match. Now..I have huge hands for a 14 year old, and I have size 8 feet. I could've wrapped my hand round his wrist three times, and my feet are about 4 times bigger than his, so. I won. And I made Claire cry, which made me feel kinda bad. She was standing on my feet, and I was holding onto her wrists cause she was trying to punch me, and I let her wrists go, and she fell back and hit her head on the back of the chair. Her mum just laughed about it and stuff, but I was like ""shit shit people are gonna think I like to hurt little kids now. shiit shit"" Lol. 

Anyway, I have this shitty ""scary fairytale"" to write for English that's to be in tomorrow..I'm only on the opening..lol.

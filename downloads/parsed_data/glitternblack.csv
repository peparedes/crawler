"event","Okay, so things with my anger are kind of calming down, but the drama isn't... how could it?  I spoke to my mother for more then five minutes for the first time in at least four weeks today, because she's been sleeping 24/7 and not eating a thing for days in a row... which makes it hard for her to stand up when she's accually awake, it's hard for me to watch her be so helpless, and in a way, the roles have sort of switched, I make sure Mum eats, and that Ed doesn't go on a rampage about every little thing(which by the way I've not been successful at).  Well the other day, my mom just starts crying and saying how sorry she was being a bad mother, I told her it wasn't her fault at all, but she insisted on making me go to my Grandmother's place... not fun, she spent at least an hour attacking everything about me, how I'm gaining weight, how I'm not 'normal'(whatever the hell that means), how my friends are horrible druggys, how I'm a loser for not being a good role model to my stupid little cousins... and the list goes on, and it made me feel like a fat, worthless, drug addicted freak... and I was crying for a long time, with no one to call >.< how sad... so I'm going home tonight THANK GOD!  Okay, I'm done with my ranting... for now,till next week my friends!"

I've been thinkong alot lately about what the hell I'm doing here, living, right now it doesn't seem for much more then to cry a whole fucking lot and get complained at alot :\ not exactly fun.  It's frustrating having the person you could accually talk to being mad at you, but I've still got my Stephanie, and other people *cough* yup.  See, look at me being all optimistic like!  Oh!  today I almost punched this fucking poser ass fucker at my school... he's always being a dick and making fun of emo... ass hole, but I stopped myself, aren't you proud?  Ed told me if it wasn't for my mom being so sick right now, he'd kick my ass out... how loving huh?  Whatever, fuck him.  I've been using that word alot lately... fuck.  Sorry, I've got problems :)  Anyway, my computer is still broken and Im using Blondies again, so bye bye till next time I get a computer"

My mum, as I'm sure I've told most of you is in the hospital again, she had to get another surgery, and has to stay there 'til thursday :(  It's difficult living with just Ed and his scary, super clean freak drunken self.  I'm at lovely Blondie's house!  She want me to take a shower *giggle*  or maybe I smell icky?  I don't know.  So, I've been chilling with Andrea lots lately... I don't know why Steph is avoiding me... eh Steph?  Why be you avoiding me?  I gots a crush finally... it'll never work out though, but it's nice having something to giggle about.  Right?  Right?!  Sure.  I've been having lots of dreams about my friends deserting me, I hope it doesn't come true.  I had one where I was hugging them, and POOF they magicly turned to dust... then another one with a long ass PT cruiser, and they were all in it, they started to drive off and I grabbed onto the mirror, then it started to stretch as they drove off, and just left me there... stretch mirrors are trippy... how in the world did my mind think of a stretchy mirror?  Had I just watched a Polly Pocket commercial maybe?  Who knows.  Alright, Im finished... now Im off to mope maybe."

I'm going insane!!!!!!!  Lack of sleep and food, and being sick gets to you after awhile.  So, last night was WEIRD, my parents got in an argument because I said I didn't care for the food!  Ed got all pissy and called me something along the lines of 'an ungrateful, selfish, immature child' er, all this because of the fact that I don't like spit pea soup?!?  Whatever, I jsut kind of let it go, but when I started to tlak again he told me to be quiet and drop it... when I was only going to talk about something that happened at school.  Eh... I don't like being sick... it makes my all hot and cold, and hungry(but I can't stand to eat), and CRAZY.  I think I'll go pass out, oooh, how fun!"

I ended up crying and hanging up on him... stupid bastard, who says shit like that to someone you haven't talked to in like... so much for him accepting me for who I was, and being 'in love' with me... what a douche!  Eh, sorry, none of you know him, so no worrys... but seriously, I'm starting to wonder if what he said was true, like... I do fuck up alot, I am doing alot of fucked up stuff, and I do tend to wonder away from school... I'm not a cocaine addict though, never even tried it!  I swear!  Anyway, I bassicly feel like shit, and I think I'm getting sick again... anyone... HELP????  Why do I bother?  Oh, I realized I need to not eat when I'm bored...

"event","I didn't go to school loday on account of my Mommy not being able to because she is sick again and has some weird pain thingy in her ribs.  I'm trying to to stress to much about it.  So, once again I'm stuck between my friends... I can't just totally ditch one because some others aren't happy with her, but it is pretty fucked what's happening, I'm trying to be mature and calm about it... but honestly I don't think anything I say to either side sinks in because the whole feud is just dumb.  They're mean to her, so she gives up on them which makes them feel like she's ditching them for fucking Scott, which I can see, but what hte hell do they care?  It's not like it's going to be their heart in a million peices is it?  I dont give a rats ass if they arent going to back Scott up, because neither am I, but totally ditching her and talking crap behind her back isnt nescary, and they are trying to tell me that they wouldn't think about and do more with a guy they really liked then their friends... thats bull shit, because I know that I would do just what she is... minus quitting the drama team because of some petty shit that gets said... whatever, I might as well just give up huh?  God damnit this sucks... I feel like a fucking rubber band being stretched so far that it's going to break... maybe I will.  Hell, I might as well just end up screaming in all of their faces and ending up in my lovely little corner that I'm always  put in after trying to fix things that I didn't even fuck up.  Did I mention that my friends on the drama team are going to ditch me if Megan lets Alexis back on the team?  How FUCKING FUCKED UP is that huh?  What bullshit.  Oh, and for all of you mommys that like to snoop, DONT if you know that theres going to be stuff you dont like... I'm sure we ALL know who I'm talking about..."

"event","'allo my sweet little 'friends'  how are ya?  Um, Im bored as hell and decided to post.  Today was okay, blondie, me and my friends sam but they bailed out and it was just me and blondie.  So, we ended up not going to the movie andj sut roaming around parklane for three hours.  Not the greatest thing ever, but it's better than being around Ed and his bitching at me.  So I got some undies and a wrist band... and osmething else I think but I can't remember.  Meh, my mom was bitching at me again today 'cause she thought she smelt ciggarette smoke, she was fucking spazzing out and calling me a fucking liar when I told her it was insense.  So she was fucking like 'Damnit Shelby, why can't I fucking trust you anymore?""  I didn't say anything, because at the moment I knew some naughty words would come out so I jsut shook my head and walked off.  But seriously, it's her own damn fault, because I earned it back, but she's got it in her head that Im the worst God damned kid in the world.  Shit man, I have to much stress, wouldn't it be rad if I could just wring it out like a wet towel?  But no, Im stuck in my nice little hole, avoiding shit like drugs, and drinking, and fucking cutting.  Sometimes it feels like I have a lack of support, just cause when I do fuck up, there isn't anyone I can tell that gives a shit, wont tell anyone, or wont judge me and get pissed off at me.  Now doesn't that suck?  Indeed.  So whatever, I'm done bitching at you guys, later."

Unlike other people, one of which got caught smoking weed in the bathroom at school today.  She came to  class and was totally freaking out because they where looking for her.  Anyway, I wanna throw up... my tummy has been being a bitch at me all day and it's bugging the shit out of me.  Perhaps it's the cold?  Afterall, the cold is my worst enemy... it's all.. cold, and not warm and stuff, its no fun.  meh, I don't even have anything to talk about... maybe I need medication?  Whatever...

Thing is, nothing really all that great has happend to me lately... if anything, things suck alot... but I don't really give a shit, I'm tired of feeling like nothing every day, so I'm just giving up on it... fuck petty shit, people(not mentioning any names) can handle their own damned problems, 'cause I don't give a shit any more... well, I do... but I'm not gunna do anything about it unless asked... so I'm just gunna let Stacie bitch, and other people bitch... and cry and moan blah,blah,blah... I'm staying happy.  Selfish?  For sure, but whatever... I'll get over it eventually.  Besides, I was getting upset over so many people and their problems that I didn't realize mine, so I couldn't fix them, thus making me unhappy.

11/17/04
I am feeling a tingel of happiness, I love my friends, they're the most awsomest people EVER.  Some people how ever aren't so great like Marshall, I just wanna smack him for hurting Steph! *breaths* Okay, so...Im seriousaly trying to kiss up to my mom so she'll let me go to the Taking Back Sunday concert, oh my god that would rock almost as much as the AFI (maby it'd be just the same in coolness!) Any ways shit to attend to to..so bye bye!


Eh, I'm doing okay, mildley sick though. WHat's new with it right? I had a mild break down in my mathclass..but I mostly kept it to myself. God people are dumn sometimes! This chick that I hang with/talk to in my 2end period thought it'd be rad to help me out by keeping my stuff and giving it to Callie to give to me in my last period class. I left the class by saying I needed a pass to the nurse but I actually went to 2nd lunch to chill with, Blondie,Miriam,Stacie and the whole crowd, because they all had complete 7th grade...NvM, I'm not gunna explain. Anyways, I ditched 2nd period 4 second lunch and Brandi decides to keep my stuff because she didn't think I would come back for it...yeah so I was spazzing and spend 1/2 of english in the office seeing if it was there. I'm still kinda sad but I'm hoping that enough of Greenday will save me! :)so...Yeah.Later"

My throat is killing me and it hurts back enough to cry when I swallow anything solid, and my nose is stuffy... like I can't breathe through it.  I can't sleep at all, and I've been up since 3:00 AM giving me like, 2 hours of sleep.  My mom has been bitching at me for reasons I wont mention and Stephanies good-for-nothing sister is a fucking backstabber... that's all I'll say.  Got I need a shoulder to cry on right now, but again I am alone... grounded from everything.  Matter of fact, I'm not even supposed to be on the computer.  Really... I'm so far into this hole, it's like God gave up on me... like my mother gave up on me... like everyone had given up on me.  I need someone to help me, but no one wants to... or looks like they want to, maybe I should just give up on life, it's that fucking easy.  I've tried waiting for the pain to go away, its evident that it wont... I'm that pathetic.  I know my life isn't as bad as alot of people's, but that's not my problem... I just want all of this to go away, all of the people nagging me, all of the people setting expectations for me that I can't live up to, the lies I'm telling to others, and to myself, the pressure.  It ownt happen though, it's life... I guess what thats what I want to end then ey?  Whatever.... shit sucks right now, that's my point..."

Ed thought I was giving attitude because of some shit that I said and started cussing at me and lecturing about respect, fuck him... he has to earn it... fucker.

So I got grounded by me mother for calling him and asshole(WHICH HE IS!!!)and now I can't go any where, whatever, Im really fucking pissed off right now and I want to cut like no other... fuck this.

Oct 19 04

  I don't want this feeling, or lack of feeling rather.  I want things to be normal again but then, where things ever normal?  Or was I just oblivious to the shit around me?  That's it, because there's no way I could have been as happy as I remember, I must have been stupid or something, becuase happiness doesn't exist for me any longer, and I don't believe it will ever.. I'm to damned pessimistic.

  I'm crying again, God I hate this feeling of hidden depression, hidden loneliness & regret. Some say you shouldn't regret your life, but I do, I hate how I turned out, this so called 'image' this so called 'originality' is bringing more pain to me then I can take.  I am not different anymore, there are so many people that try to be clones of me.  I just judge automaticly & say that they aren't being real and I miss myself offsometimes, I have really low self esteem right now.  It's like I'm not good enough for the world, I'm bottling up my emotions because it's impossible for me to talk to someone and take something from is.  My mom is always bitching because she thinks I don't caring about her... I do, but what the hell does she want from me?  I try my best to respect her and not be an ass, but ya know, I slip sometimes.  So school has become an annoyance, I don't want to be tehre I swear it's a mirical I haven't blown up on a large scale then the bus thing.  Man, now I'm staring at this with a blank mind & music in the background that I can't comprehend right now.  Something is bugging me, lonliness is what I figured so far, I think I'm falling for someone I can't have, only this time it's different, damn society.  I'm crying again, but I still of coarse want Davey(go fuckin figure right?)  He smiled at me and said hi today, I should have done something, I'm such an idiot.  I'm feeling overwhelmed again, I'm always overwhelmed it seems, I have expectations that I can't live up to, and it's stressing me out big time.  I hate not being able to do/get what I want, I don't want this pain anymore... *crys*

TODAY:

I'm feeling okay today, bored and strained, but I haven't cried yet... yet... it'll come later.  I'm listening to a song that reminds me a tad to much of a certain SOMEONE!  Damnit... so I'm more then likely going to be boreder then hell this weekend, the only shit that I'm doing is going to a damned foot ball game at UNR tomarrow, I hope Calli will go, or it'll be pure torture I tell you... fuck.  Oh well... w/e, I'm done, later."

"event","Okay, I'm feeling real down right now... sort of like I've been pushed to the side... like I'm unwanted and well, sort of hated.  I'm getting really clingy and dependent on people, and frankly... I don't like that.  I don't like needing people, and getting sick when I feel lonely.  I feel empty all the time, I have alot of shit that I'm dealing with, and seriously I'm not sure I can take it much longer.  I feel as though my mind is being crushed, slowly by a boulder.  I need a break from all of this, but not just a little bit of sleep, I'm talking like... all day and night sleep... but I can't sleep that long.  I'm lucky if I manage 5 hours of sleep, I'm having alot of nightmares... of people dieing, myself dieing, watching people I love dearly being ripped to peices, and my own heart being torn apart by everyone I love and care for.  Oh my God... I want things to be normal again... nice and calm and normal... that would be nice, oh yes, really really nice. but it's not going to be... not now, not ever...


 Now, I shall put a note  Alexis gave to me at school today...


Dear Shelby,
    I can't take it anymore.  The drugs, cutting, being arrestedd.  That pisses me off.  I don't know what to do when I heared about what happend yesterday.    I was ticked.    Shelby, I really don't want to be a friend with a drunk, cutter, and being arrested chick.  OK I am guessing what you are thinking after you read that, you want to rip this up so bad and I know it, becuase you don't want to be lectured.  Well I don't care, Shelby, I'm sorry and I don't wnat you to be pissed at me, and I am not pissed at you... just a little dissapointed for what happend.  

Your Friend, 
Blondie

My reply... I never gave this to her


Alexis,
  What the hell?!  I have a right to be pissed at you.  Damnit, I don't do drugs!  I smoked like... three times!  And I don't drink... personally I hate the taste of alcohol!  And as for getting arrested, all I did was fucking cuss at someone!  I really don't need this shit right now.  You really don't think I know that my life is fucked up right now?!  What would you do in my situation Alexis... seriously!  I'm sorry if I'm not a perfect angel like you OKAY?!  Seriously... how would you handle shit if your mom had cnacer, you friends acted like they hated you, you got arrested for saying 'fucking bitch', you had just gone through something that felt like your heart being ripped out five times and someone stomped on it, and you where way behind in your classes?!?  Exactly... I know your parents such & all, but PLEASE!  Try to have some damned sympothy for your best friend!  You know how fucking scared I am for my mom?!?  She could DIE!  I could never see you again!  Then what!!??  Damn, I have no one that relates that I can talk to...  just try to be supportive and not pick at every little thing I do wrong okay?!  I'm not perfect... and if you don't want to be a friend with a cutter/ getting arrested chick, then I guess I really over rated the ammount of loyalty I had in you... damn...

Love,
  Shelby Paxton"

"event","Alright, so... this weekend was complete shit.  Friday, holly shit, I dont remember a thing about it... saturday... oh boy, let's see I went over to Stacie's house... yeah, so now she hangs out with stoner people.  I was given a ciggarette and booze, of coarse I had matches, but the damn wind... yeah wasted them... so I realized what crap that stuff is and how I felt afterwards <i>last</i> time I did them.  Stacie was really upset, she thinks she has no friends just because a group of people at our school hate her.  Seriously... I think of her as a close friend, someone I can accually tell stuff to and not have the world find out like most everyone else I know.  We relate on alot of different levels, and I know she isn't the best of influences.. but I really think we could help eachother.  Now I talked to her about some stuff that was going on... drugs booze stuff like that, and she ended up feeling better I suppose. But aparently it didn't sink in and I seriously bet that if her parents wherent awake, she would have snuck off and done some shit with her so called 'friends'.  Sunday... eh, saw people... got pissed off at a few of them... let's not go there.  I'm sort of worried about Cesar.  Eh, my emotions are on end right now, esspecially with my mom's situation with cancer and what not... I guess I really didn't notice how much I had when Darin was around, it's been like a week since I talked to him and I miss him, I could really use someone to talk to that I could trust and not hurt thier feelings when I talk about certain stuff.  I would talk to Alexis, It's just... I don't know I'm not sure she would know what to do... I mean, It's nice to know she's there for me... but I just have a feeling stuff will get around like it did once, and that's not good... oh God, here comes another break down... hide the fucking razors... no, I'm stronger then that... holly shit I need help... counciling or something, I've got some fucking problems"

"event","wow, this week a really a waste, it seems as though I didn't do anything.  Eh, school... homework... regular old music, normal food, church.  Damn, I'm going though one of my changing stages again.  When I want to change like, everything about myself.  My hair was very amusing this morning, I put it into little chunk/spikes that dont stick up things, nifty, but a pain in the ass to try to see through, not to mention the gell I used was complete shit.  Ahaha, PE was amusing, not really PE, pretty much two teams had to do stuff while my team sat around.  I ended up getting white and purple color in my hair.  It didn't last long though since our intstructor said it wasnt a proper use of time and made me wash it out.  Eh, whatever... it was still fun.  Alright, feeling okay... sort of getting tired of some people and their stupidity... no worries, it's none of you guys.  Okay, so I'm feeling the need to be held, I've noticed it's been a long time since I got a kiss or got to cuddle... normal for me... but still, I have a right to fell that way right???  RIGHT!  damn... there's something seriously wrong with me... heh"

"event","Well, I'm bored again.  My brain is on off and I want to do something.  Again I've been thinking far to much about wanting to be held, thus my sort of sad sort of happy mood.  Maybe I'll walk down to 711 and get some skittles, alone, maybe I just want to hang out with someone, it's not my fault I'm coming down from a sugar high. It's not my fault that when I come down from a sugar high, I'm extremely emotional and I think to much about how lonely I can be sometimes(sometimes meaning when I'm bored).  

Grrr, why does it have to be so cold?  I don't like the cold, it makes me shiver, not to mention the fact that my heater is a peice of shit.  Woah, I'm in a really complainy mood right now, hopefully this is all just PMS... cause I don't wanna be sad again, being sad stinks.  Alright, I'm finished with my mindless ramblings, bye bye."

"event","lets see here, interesting day indeed.  Last night was amusing, I got to talk to a couple of people that I've never spoken with before.  Molly is officially the most amusing hyper person I've ever seen, and Scott is an ass hole... again.  Any hoot, Blondie sayed the night and we decided to walk to Raley's this morning, on our way there we stopped at Stacie's to see if she wanted to come, she wasn't allowed, so we just walked about her trailer park for awhile before she had to go back home.  Then we went to see if Davey and all them wanted to come, they were sleeping, lazy ass bums.  Anyway, I watched Passion of the Christ for the first time, powerful movie.  Sort of got me thinking about stuff in the world.  I ended up crying for about an hour because I was thinking about stuff with me mum and I guess cause of guilt due to that one night at Stacie's, and partly cause of the world I suppose.  So I was thinking about shit that happends at my school and things people do and say, and that's just jr. high, only.  So one of my friend's brother has died in the war about a week ago.  She's pretty torn up.  It sickens me to know how many other people are experiancing that same feeling.  Now she's going to drugs, and cutting and shit, reminds me veugly of myself.  She has alot going on that I'd rather not put here, so I guess maybe I'll try to show her God, she needs him right now.  Her situation sort of makes me grateful of what I have, no matter how much I feel I need 'someone', at least I'm not where she is.  

Yeah, so I threw up just alittle bit ago cause my nerves are on edge, not good, now I have the worst head ache I think I've ever had.  Meh, good day turned a little to thought wrenching.  Ah, yet another party has arosen, damn I swear, those boys gotta learn that weed and crack don't exactly make my friend <i>or</i> me want to jump over their house and become buddy buddy with them... it happend once to us, I'll do whatever it takes to have it never happen again.  I think my rebellion stage is almost over, and I did it all without getting a boyfriend and cheating on them.  Surprised?  So am I.  Not really, but what the hell, I'm bored and overly emotional, but mixture my friends, bad mixture.  I think I'll just go shower, yes, showering sounds just lovely right now doesn't it?  Yes indeed it does kind sirlady."

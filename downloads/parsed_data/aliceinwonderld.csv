"event","Time is so funny. Sometimes it seems to drag along and never really get us anywhere. And other times it goes by too quickly not giving us enough of it to catch up with where we should be. Lately everyday seems to be so humdrum and boring as I wake up, go to work, come home, sleep, then wake up and do it all again. I've found myself so discontent with my life lately. The tiny bits of time that I have off of work, I battle with myself on where I will spend those sacred moments. With Justin? With my family? With a friend? I try to even it out, but it's not easy. I don't think any of them really understand how hard it is to make that decision. It's been a while since I had a day to myself. A day that I can just lay in bed all day and not worry about anything else. And I don't want to make it seem like I don't like spending time with them, b/c I love it. I just hate the battle I go though. Well, I get paid this week. I'll be putting a bit of money aside for the the Mary Kay party I will be going to May 7th. A good friend of mine that just started selling it invited me. I've bought a few things from her and plan to buy more at the party.  Yes the stuff is nice, but boy is it expensive. lol. I think my mom is suppose to be coming with me. Well, enough chit chat. Goodnight!"

"event","I've been cleaning my room for 3 days now. This has been crazy. BUT it's really starting to look good. I boxed up many things from my closet and will be putting them in the attic. The rest is in 6 huge garbage bags sitting outside. lol. I still have more to do, but not too much. I think one more day should do it. I will also be getting me a entertainment center so I can arrange my things (TV, PS2, DVD player, VHS player, etc....). It's just sooo messy right now. I also think I am going to start bring back some of my old hobbies. I loved scrapbooking, not crappy, simple scrapbooking; the expensive, time consuming scrapbooking. lol. I also liked to draw, paint, write, and read. I'll be bringing that back as well. It just seems as though I let a lot of me go for a while. But when I have the little off of work that I do get, I want to spend it doing things I enjoy. That is of course, if my mom and sister are busy doing other things. This is b/c Justin is always working when I'm off and I'm always working when he's off. We hardly ever see each other. I have brought back old friendships and old hobbies. Hopefully I'll be happy and not lonely when I am not with him. I have also begun to eat better and a few other things. I just feel it's time for a change. Well, I hope everyone is well and that everyone on Spring Break or about to go on Spring Break has a good one."

"event","I haven't updated in a while, nor have I even come to this site. Anyway, yesterday was wonderful. I expected nothing and got so much. While at work I received first a cute bag of kisses tied to a balloon from my mom. Then I was sent a carnation from her with a nice lil note. After that a delivery woman showed up with flowers and THE teddy bear I wanted this V-day (my dad sent this). And finally, to top it all off, my sweetie showed up! He brought me the biggest most cutest balloon, beautiful flowers, and the sweetest card. He really made my day by coming to see me. Everyone walked by and commented on the amount of things I had received. Lol. I felt so loved. The reason I didn't expect anything was b/c my mom told me she wasn't going to get me anything. I knew my dad was sending my mom flowers but I didn't think he was sending me any. And Justin had already given me purple roses, candy Turtles, and Swedish Fish (yummie) the night before. I didn't expect anything else. AND he was SUPPOSE to be at school. lol. Ah well, his mom and I forgave him.
So, continuing with my lovely day... when I got to his house last night, I opened the door to see him down on one knee with his arms stretched out telling me he loves me. AAAAWWWWWW! Big hug and big kiss of course. Then I saw the wonderful arrangement he had on the table for us to eat. OH MY GOSH! He cooked the most wonderful meal. Chicken Marinara with noodles. I love rosemary and it had lots of it. We had wine to drink, that was the perfect flavor for what we were eating. All of this of course by candle light. I was baking brownies while we were eating. 
After we had stuffed ourselves on the main meal, the brownies were ready to go. So we had one of them and I settled down on the sofa with him and rubbed his tired feet. 
We then went to his room and he popped in The Cure dvd of their videos. :-) I love that. So we just cuddled on his bed listening and watching the TV till we finally fell asleep. I woke up around 11 something and decided to go home. And home I went as happy as can be. I honestly don't think anything could have made me feel more loved then all that was done for me yesterday. I will post pictures soon of some of the flowers I got and of my teddy bear. I do hope everyone had a lovely day yesterday, and if not, hopefully next year will be better for you."

Woo woo, rolling on with 2005. I'll be 21, giving a good look towards my future, and hopefully making some new friends along the way.
Ya know, I am really loving the Christmas gift that I gave to ME. I am sleeping so well now."

"event","Today is one of those feel like shit days. It just doesn't seem to go away. I am in pain and I don't want to go to work. I can't wait to see Justin today. We had the greatest weekend. I just love to be around him. I'd just like to say thank you to Justin for taking up for me when I was hit by that tub of lard that weighs over 250 lbs. Sure when you hit him it wasn't really felt b/c of the fat, but darling, you made a point and that's what counts.  Tj is out of our lives, once again lol, and hopefully it will stay that way. I feel better already, aside from the throbbing pain I feel in my head."

"event","Yes, I have a problem. I played Silent Hill 3 for a couple of hours last night and I got very little sleep. It's not that I had nightmares, but I just couldn't stop thinking about the game and seeing images of it. I know this sounds crazy, but it seriously messed up my sleeping time. And yet,  I don't want to stop playing it. I don't want to give it up. Hopefully the thoughts and images will go away. :-)"

"event","My weekend was pretty eventful.  Yesterday I had to do clinical time for paramedic school at ST Luke West Hospital in their labor and delivery department.  When I got there, their was a woman in labor.  About 2 hours later it was an imminent delivery.  I went in to watch and the Doctor asked me if I wanted to deliver the baby.  I thought to myself, why the hell not.  It's something that I might have to do one day so...I delivered a baby.  It was disgusting and fascinating all at the same time.  There was a lot of fluid flying everywhere for a little bit which was gross, but the baby delivered fine and turned out well.  It was quite and experience.  
Today a few people from work and myself climbed the Crew Tower.  It was for lung health or something like that.  804 steps and 45 floors later MY LUNGS WERE ON FIRE.  Unfortunately they didn't give us our time when we got to the top but I estimate that I finished in about 9 minutes.  It was a fun time."

"event","In paramedic school our class is going through different scenarios to practice advanced life support procedures.  In one of the evolutions there is this super expensive mannequin that basically is like a real person.  This thing can talk, you can take his blood pressure and pulse, his chest will rise and fall with each breath and you can hear breath sounds or lack there of.  It really is quite extensive.  Well if anyone knows anything about me, I am terrified of robots and aliens.  They really just scare the hell out of me.  Well this stupid mannequin really reminds me of a robot because it can talk and move.  I walked into the room and I saw it's chest moving up and down and it was talking...I almost flipped out.  It took everything I had to go near it and then I had to check to see if it had a pulse!  I felt where a pulse would be and there was one.  I was just waiting for it to get off the table and walk out of the room.  I hope I don't have to encounter this thing again.  I hate it."

"event","I haven't updated in forever.  I hope to more often in the future.  There has been so much on my mind I feel I need to get stuff out.  I've come to the conclusion that I love my job.  I have seen some interesting stuff lately.  We rolled up on a non-breather.  We get her into the ambulance and when we cut her shirt off and her bra was all black and discolored.  We took that off and where her left breast was, was all rotten out and infected.  It seemed like she didn't ever change her bra and it was growing into her body.  Everytime I put my hand down to do a chest compression it felt like I was going to break through her body.  No one could figure out what it was but we did know whatever it was, it smelled horrible.  One of my partners ended up throwing up in the back of the squad.  I don't know how I didn't.  When we got to the hospital we found out it was untreated breast cancer.  I never thought it would look like that.
Wednesday night found out to be an eventful night.  Around 7 we were called to a 24 y/o male non-breather. Our ambulance is already on the scene along with a million police.  We get there and find out it's a suicide.  This dude hung himself because he got into a fight with his girlfriend.  He was in the basement.  Our crew was already to work on him when we get there.  I saw him and he had a pretty deep indentation on his neck from where the extension cord was and from there up he was bluish purple.  My Captain let me try to intubate him.  It didn't work very well.  That was my first attempt ever and it probably didn't help that his throat was all swollen.  I don't feel too bad though because the paramedic didn't make it either.  
A few weeks ago we get called to an unconscious/unresponsive patient.  We get there and he is laying in the back of a SUV.  His friends say he is haveing a seizure.  We see him and he's not having a seizure, he's postureing which isn't good at all.  That usually means that you have increased intercrainal pressure.  We throw him in the back of the squad and check his blood sugar which could be the reason he's doing this.  That turns out okay.  I notice he's a little cool to the touch but I figured it was just because he was outside in the cold for a little bit.  We do all the other stuff we can do for him and we go to the hospital.  The nurses notice too that he is cool to the touch and they take his temperature.  It was way below normal.  They throw some warm blankets on him and wrap him up.  A few minutes later the dude wakes up!  He was unconscious because he was too cold.  His body just shut down.  I would've never of thought that could happen.
Thursday we also had a structure fire around 2 in the morning.  When we arrived on scene we were greeted by the guy who lives there.  His skin was falling off his arms.  He informed us that he was attempting to put out the fire.  He was badly burned everywhere.  We could see the fire from the window on the second floor in the bi-level house.  I asked him if the front door was open and he said it wasn't.  My partner and I then proceeded to force entry into the door.  We were able to get it halfway open.  Something was preventing it from opening at the bottom.  As soon as we forced half of it the fire blew out of the second story window, we had to get back and mask up.  My lieutenant masked up before us and knocked the rest of the door open.  We found out later that the guy that lives there nailed it shut at the bottom for some unknown reason.  That could've been bad if we didn't force it open at first and someone had to get out of it later if they were trapped or hurt.  The engine company put water on the fire while my parnter and I searched for other victims.  Luckily we didn't find any.  It was a good fire but the crew that I was with didn't preform well at all.  I was on a truck with people that had 30+ years of experience and I was the one who had to carry them around.  I had to tell them what to do...it should've not been like that at all.  It was so bad that one of the people is being written up.  If you can't stand the heat, get out.

Also, I am going to run a marathon in May.  I am quite excited about this."

"event","Just to forewarn everybody, if you have a weak stomach,you might not want to read this.

Basically, last night sucked...a lot.  I was about 6 hours away from finishing up my 36 hour straight shift at Forest Park when I discovered I had food poisoning.  I don't even know how many times I've thrown up today.  I have finally stopped throwing up and my stomach feels much better but now I have acquired a fever of 101 degrees and a splitting headache.  I can't relax and I am dehydrated.  I would not wish any of this on anyone, ever...well maybe a certain few but I won't go into that.  On top of that, I haven't really slept in the past 5 days and this whole epidemic will not let me sleep.  I hope this passes soon because I feel horrible.

I've decided that I really love working at Forest Park Fire Department.  I have learned so many things and seen so many things in the little time that I've been there.  During my 36 hour shift I had my first code.  A code is a cardiac arrest.  The person has no pulse and is not breathing.  I almost had two of them in the past but my Capitan called both of them DOA.  (dead on arrival)  They were dead long enough that there was no way of saving them.  Anyways, we get to this older guy and my Capitan decided that has gone down in a small enough time frame where we can do CPR and try to revive him.  Now usually when someone goes down, they vomit and lose their bowls.  I must definitely say this guy did.  The people that I'm with have me start doing chest compressions.  He definitely had fluid and vomit still in him and every time I did a chest compression, a fountain of fluid and vomit would arise up out of his mouth.  We move this guy to the squad and I start suctioning the fluid out of his mouth so that we can intubate him (stick a tube down his windpipe to his lungs so that he has an adequate airway) and so that fluid won't go into his lungs when we bag him.  (force air into his lungs)  We finally get him intubated but there is some fluid in his lungs.  So again whenever I do a chest compression, fluid is coming up through this tube.  It almost hit me a few times.  Luckily it stopped.  The paramedics get an IV into him and start pushing all of these drugs into him to try and get his heart to restart.  When we get to the hospital the doctor calls it.  He's dead.  It really wasn't as upsetting to me as I thought it would be.  I realize that most everyone you get to when they code are already dead.  I'm pretty sure that was the case when we got to that guy.  If I dwell on all the deaths that I've seen then I wouldn't be able to function.  So I am going to try my best not too.  The thing that sucked the most though was that this guy smelled...and I still smell his smell.  It almost makes me sick.  Hopefully it goes away.  
I think it's going to be very hard to deal with deaths when someone close to me dies.  I really haven't had anyone I know die.  My grandparents live in Forest Park.  I just really hope that I don't have to see them die.  It definitely was a learning experience.  The people I was with said I did an awesome job at what I had to do.  That made me feel good.  Next week we have car extrication class.  I'm excited about this."

I went to Taylor's funeral today.  I really didn't know him but I felt I should be there.  I don't know why I felt I should've been there.  I feel as if I did something right by being there though.  I don't know...  
I think I'm going crazy.  I have the hardest time relaxing and I can't sit still.

"event","I hate being sick.  I was only able to work 6 hours of my 24 hour shift.  They pretty much told me to go home, which I didn't really have any objection to.  Of course, about 3 hours after I left, they had a stabbing.  Why do I always miss the cool shit?  That would've been my first stabbing.  Maybe next time.  Before that though, we were called to someone is cardiac arrest.  Both of our ambulances and our engine were out.  I was on the ladder, so Jim, my Capitan and I start going and we meet Springfield Township there.  Somehow we both read the street wrong and we ended up in the wrong place.  So while we're in route to the right house, I'm thinking, this person is dead.  It's probably will be 5 minutes until we get there from the time we were dispatched.  Who knows how long the person has been in that situation.  Really, if someone doesn't start working on a person in cardiac arrest within a certain time, I think it's like 6 minutes, they really have no chance of survival.  Anyways, we get there and whoever it was went ahead and called it.  We didn't work on the person or anything, dead on arrival.  Now, this person had been dead for awhile, but I was thinking, just think if this person just went into cardiac arrest.  One wrong turn, because someone couldn't read their pager correctly, killed someone.  All it takes is one stupid mistake."

"event","A lot of stuff has gone on within this past week.  Last weekend I attended my first ever scooter rally.  I must say it was a hell of a lot of fun.  All in all there were about two hundred scooters there.  The ride started in Cincinnati, went through Western Hills and Delhi.  We then crossed the Ohio River via the Anderson Ferry, went to Devo Park, through Covington and Newport and ended back in Cincinnati.  It was fun times.  I can't believe that many people were there.  
Monday, Forest Park Fire Department called me and told me they wanted to hire me.  Awesome.  I went up there that day and got fitted for turnout gear and obtained some hand-me-down uniforms.  I also get $250 worth of new uniforms.  I start in one week.  Next Wednesday.  The first ten shifts I work, I will have a mentor and then after those ten shifts I am cut loose to pick up shifts whenever I want.  I'm excited.  
Today, UC called me and told me that I am accepted into their Paramedic program at Raymond Walter's.  I start that in mid-August.  
It seems like everything comes at once.  Craziness."

Of course I was very annoyed considering I thought another stupid customer needed help or worse, they were going to make me run a register even though it was not my turn.  Much to my surprise, a security guard from the mall was having an all out seizure.  Now I have never seen a seizure before.  It was quite frightening because I didn't know what to expect.  His whole body turned bright purple from lack of oxygen and my other co-worker and I thought that he had stopped breathing.  I went to go get a pocket face mask to do CPR but luckily he started getting some color back in his face when I came back.  He must have seized for at least 4 minutes but it felt like 10.  I'm just happy that I knew what to do.  I just put him on his side so that he wouldn't choke on his drool or tongue.  That's really all I could do.  A lot of times I feel helpless in these situations.  I really can't do anything for most people.  Either I don't have any equipment to do anything for them or I can't give them the drugs they need.  By the time the paramedics came he had stopped seizing and was somewhat coherent.  He couldn't follow simple directions and seemed scared and confused.  Which from what I understand in normal.  He should be fine though.  Either way it was quite and experience.  What sucks though, is that sometimes it seems like I have more ""runs"" at Kohl's than I do at Little Miami.

From what I understand, the last time this test was given for this department, 15 girls took the test.  None of them passed.  I believe I am the first girl to pass the test there.  The girls that work there now didn't have to take that same test when they were hired.  From what I heard, it was much easier.  For this group of people I was the only girl to take the test and the only girl that passed.  I hope I get hired.  Everyone seems to think I will.  Unfortunately, I think I will still have to stay at Kohl's a couple days a week because of health insurance.  I am seriously going to look into getting health insurance outside of it though.
I really miss playing soccer.  I was hoping to get a team together but I only know one other person that even plays.  Well at least one other person that I could actually get a hold of.  
I found out my Uncle has cancer.  I really don't find myself upset about this.  All the advances in technology and all the people who survive cancer make me not worry.  But when I talk to him I just want to cry.  I hope he will be ok.

"event","Finally...we had a run.  Of course it had to be at 3 a.m. but I will take what I can get.  The call came in as a possible stroke and then as we went in route, dispatch said that the person wasn't breathing and that CPR was being administered.  And then I thought, damn, this is the real thing again.  I might be seeing someone take their last breath tonight.  When we arrived at the residence, CPR wasn't being administered and the patient was breathing.  I was surprised that I wasn't more nervous.  I still feel helpless in these runs but I do what I know to do.  That's all I can do.  I didn't have to transport the patient rather go back to the fire house and sleep.  It was kind of nice but I still wouldn't have minded transporting.  Apparently the patient had a seizure once they got to the hospital.  I've never seen a seizure.  I think it would kind of freak me out.  Now that I think about it...I'm surprised I chose this profession because I think a lot of stuff would freak me out.
Today I got my results back from the City of Hamilton.  136 people took the test.  106 passed it.  I rank 38.  Considering this was my first civil service test ever, I'm very happy with my score.  I guess I still have an outside chance to take the agility test.  I hope they find a lot of people below me that have DUIs and criminal histories so that I rank higher.  
Tomorrow is Forest Park's test.  I think I'm kicking ass for my size, considering we have to wear a 50 lb vest and 10 lbs heavier that would be half of my body weight.  I'm almost positive that I'm not going to finish in time.  I'm going to do my best though."

I know I have the strength to do it but I am worried about the time limit.  Numerous things have to be completed within 8 minutes and 20 seconds.  I think I will be ok but I have failed a couple of agility tests in the past and I've very nervous about failing yet another one.  Of course I didn't have the strength then that I do now.  Jim will kick my ass if I fail this test and so will I.  That is why I am going to pass it.

My Captain also took me over to see the other station.  It's not as nice as ours.  I'm happy I don't work over at that one.  The people seem weird and very hyper.  For some reason whenever that station gets a fire call our station also has to accompany them.  Yesterday I was on the Engine and they had an alarm drop.  So we had to go.  Since I was on the engine I had to ride it over there.  That was the first time that I rode the on the fire truck.  It was pretty exciting.  I had some of my gear on and I felt official.  For some reason that call made me less nervous about being on the fire truck.  Of course we were disregarded before we even made it over there but it was awesome riding in the truck.  Last night was the first night I slept in the bunk room with everyone else and despite what I thought, it wasn't bad at all.  I slept really well and no one snored.  It was nice.  This morning I came home and took a nap before work.  I woke up and called off.  So then I proceed to go back to sleep and slept until about 2.  I can't stand working at Kohl's anymore.  I really need to find a new job.  Like now.  I don't care if it's a fire job or not.  I think at this point I will work anywhere but Kohl's.  Tonight I start a Spanish class for medical personnel.

I'm a little nervous about the Captain though.  One of the guys was saying that sometimes he's not very clear on what he wants and sometimes no one really knows where they're at until the call comes in.  I was in the position last night where whatever type of call came in, I would be on that apparatus.  We had two calls.  One was a lifting assistance call and the other was a diabetic emergency.  So I only rode on the ambulance which was fine with me.  Despite what I thought I slept like a baby.  So at 1:30 A.M. when our pagers went off, the bells rang, and the lights came on it scared the hell out of me.  I was sleeping good too, but I guess I should expect that from now on.  During that call I was listening to the radio and noticed that Forest Park was having a big ass fire.  Then it hit me and kind of freaked me out that I could have a huge fire as well.  Luckily we didn't but I realized that this is the real thing now.  I'm where I want to be.  It's exciting but very very scary too.
I came home this morning and had Christmas with my family.  It was nice.  My dad made me a mix cd.  Even though I received other gifts I think this is my favorite one.

It's kind of nice because some people respect me already since Bryan has talked about me a lot and Tom knows I know my shit.  But something has already pissed me off.  The Lt. in charge of training said to Bryan, ""It's hard to believe that your girlfriend could pull that 145lb dummy 100ft.""  Basically he was implying that I got this job only because I knew Bryan and he pulled some strings and I'm his girlfriend.  Luckily, the people that I took the test in front of were there and said no, Julie is a fucking badass.  She fucked that dummy up.  And yes, yes I did fuck that dummy up hardcore.  I mean really, why the fuck would you say something like that when it's the first time you've ever seen me.  He hasn't seen me preform anything.  So fuck him.  He's already made enemies with me.
Anyways, I really think I'm losing it.  So far, I thought I lost my phone when it was in my purse the whole time.  I didn't even look in there before I searched everywhere for it.  Also, the other day I was attempting to get some gas and the nozzle would not fit in the gas tank to save my life.  Thank god the nozzles are bigger on the diesel pumps and it would not fit into my gas tank because yes, I tried to put diesel fuel in my car."

In a few weeks I will go though their training program to learn their way of doing things and to learn how to drive the ambulance.  The only downside with this is that it took me an hour to get to the station.  I think rush hour traffic had to do with it but still...it sucks.  I'll take what I can get though.

"event","I need to start becoming confident. I'm way to intimidated by everyone. I think maybe if I start working out or something it'll get better. I don't know? A lot of the time I'm worried that I'm really lame and so I just kindof stop talking when I'm with people. I bet it bothers Ben. Even though he says he doesn't mind. Whatever, it's annoying and I don't know how to fix it. Ben's been really sweet lately and he's nice. I'm always happy when I'm with him. The other day though, we got into kindof a fight cos I was upset and he was being lame. Then he got kinda mad and was like "" well, I'm sorry I can't make you happy."" And I was like you know that's not true. But I was crying because the weather makes me depressed and than it just seemed like one endless cycle of everything. So, I've decided I'm gonna start doing things I use to. And look for a job, really. I'm gonna go to cahoots agian, renew my membership at the Y, try and work at cahoots? Maybe. We'll see. Paint your plate is also hiring, that'd be fun. Oh, and everyone else seems so confident and shit. That's lame, I have no idea what I like. 

Other than all that in my head, I'm wonderfully happy! Everythings grand. I love my school, it's amazing. And I have a good group of friends there that I love. And a boyfriend, who I also love. He's really nice to me and I try and be nice to him too? Haha, I am. He said the absolute cutest thing to me the other night. We were laying in bed about to go to sleep and he was kindof worried about something and stuff and I said to him 
don't think about it to much
and he's like
i'm not, don't worry
and then it was quiet
and he said
"" i'm glad your gonna be laying next to me when i wake up tomorrow ""

...like can he be anymore smooth than that?! it was cute, i was happy...obviously.


okay i'll shutup noww."

"event","My MEA was descent. I went to Cali to see all my camp friends; Charlie, Megan, Reid, Lisa, and Georgia. It was kinda fun. But like, Cali is to rich. And ritzy. I didn't feel at home. The people there make it known they have a lot of money but in Stp we're more modest. And I like that a lot better. All I can say is....ain't no place to be but stp! It's the truth. Ben picked my Mom and I up from the airport and we dropped her off at a restaurant to meet my Dad. I hung out with Ben, Dom, and Carl. Then Ben came over for a long time afterwards. I missed him while I was in Cali. A lot. He's a good guy : ).

1. Have you ever told someone to their face that they were ugly? I tell Ben he's ugly everyday.
2. Do you chew with your mouth open or closed?I hope closed..
3. Is your bed against more than one of your walls? It's all over the place hah.
4. What do you think about swingers? Whatever floats your boat.
5. Do you think it's gay for men to get pedicures? Whatever.
6. Do you go to the dentist more than once a year? Nope.
7. Have you ever been attracted to someone's parent? I remember when everyone had a crush on Cole's dad.
8. What is the last thing you read besides this question? The one above it/my answer. God, I hate stupid surveys.
9. Are you currently in a relationship, single, or married? Relationship.
10. What's one really random fact about yourself? I pick my eyelashes out when I'm nervous.
11. Have you ever went to kiss somebody and missed their lips? Yeah. It's cool though, we were drunk.
12. Are any of your friends more than 10 years older than you? No.
13. Do you think the legal drinking age should be changed? Maybe, but I don't care.

I am Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the greatest military man in Roman history. You have most certainly heard of me -- I saved the city from disaster and certain doom, and established long-lasting peace. <STRIKE>At least until Caesar came along and screwed everything up. Blasted amateur.

That was, of course, all Gaius Marius' fault. Don't mention that name around me, and we'll be fine.</STRIKE>

I'm a patrician -- probably the only one with true noble blood among all of you. My beauty was legendary, as all Romans here most certainly remember. <STRIKE>Caesar? If you don't remember, <I>ask your mom, beyotch</I>.</STRIKE>

<strike>Also legendary were my parties, my tea-drinking habits and my flawless, Greek-ish taste for young theather actors. But anyone who's been around me for long enough knows that, of course. How many people in this community are manly enough to walk around with 'Bitch' written on their foreheads?</strike>

I have decided to give you the honour of corresponding with a superior <STRIKE>cruel</STRIKE> <STRIKE>evil</STRIKE> <STRIKE>sadistic</STRIKE> <I>gentle</I>man such as myself. I'm sure you are very grateful. Don't mention it. <STRIKE>Invitations for tea would be v. appreciated.</STRIKE>"

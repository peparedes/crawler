"event","I think my vegetable garden is being eaten by both groundhogs <i>and</i> deer.  Despite all my fence work, I was willing to believe it was just groundhogs until a) my 3x3 bed of bush beans, which I'd fenced off separately so they could grow back from being chomped, were chomped again without any apparent disturbance of the three-foot fence; b) the pole bean plants six feet high were also chomped down to bare stems.  I refuse to imagine groundhogs climbing a flimsy structure of plastic poles and string and managing to eat at the same time.

So, no beans this year.  Parsley is now all gone too, along with nearly all the sunflower seedlings, the kale and Swiss chard, and a good part of the sweet potato vines.  Tomatillos chomped down, though the fruit is forming.  Squash plants not touched yet; melon plants only bitten lightly on the outside of the tangle, though I am holding my breath:  they're doing too well, making lots of lovely fruit, and I'm sure either squash borers will kill them or the deer will get hungrier.  Tomatoes not eaten yet, though I have no hopes for the fruit once it ripens.  Peppers okay so far.  Asparagus ferns not appetizing for some reason.  Cardoons doing beautifully, but since I have no plans to eat them that's small comfort.  Lots of onions; potatoes will probably survive although someone did take bites out of the plants.

I'll have to put up a real deer fence over the winter.  And even so I may grow beans and chard and so forth up on the deck.

I'm going to be a pig about the demo garden harvest.  Hopefully we'll have no major crop failures there, or I will end up feeling cursed and even more incompetent.  Why cannot I manage to at least feed my family, instead of the families of neighborhood wildlife?  Gardening sucks, and so do I."

"event","Part of my ongoing effort to be Queen of Recyclers: tomato plants went into the bed where the pipe hoops for the winter tunnel were still standing.  They are now too big for the little stakes I started them with, so I've bound the hoops together into a support structure with old soaker hose that's too holey and kinked to use.  It looks wacko, but I think it'll work.  I've been using the ""plant ladder"" things from Gardener's Supply for tomatoes, but they are not really wide enough for full-size tomato plants, and are being used for melons this year.

The soaker hose replacement (i.e. the irrigation system) is mostly in now; I did the ""north-side"" T-junction section yesterday and just have to put in a few extension bits for peppers in pots, and maybe a piece for the onions, potatoes and one tomato outside the fence, though I'd need more half-inch tubing for that.  If I order a timer as well, I don't have to get anyone to water while we're away in August, though that does mean the water running every day even if it rains.  But it hardly ever rains in August (except thunderstorms, and I always end up watering before thunderstorms anyway).

Still have to plant some squash and sunflowers.  (Same at the demo garden, where we weeded ourselves silly yesterday.  But it looks much better!)"

"event","Noon and 90 degrees, heat index of 98, which is not typical for June even in this new overheated world we're creating.  Where did our nice cool spring go?

Air conditioning has been getting a workout since Thursday; at least we've had power for it, unlike some who had it knocked out in the big storm Wednesday and didn't get it back for days afterwards.  I've only been able to spend short work periods outside.  Ideally I'd be out at 6 a.m., which only works if I don't have to be everyone else's alarm clock.  What with the heat and the rain everything is growing like crazy, including the weeds, but I see major growth on summer vegetables as well, that had been sitting around complaining about the cold up till last week.  I've basically lost all the spring crops, either to heat or groundhog - really I should just give up and grow them in the fall.

After the kale and the peas got chomped, I was sure the critter was climbing over the fence, and determined to build it higher, slowed down only by the steambath that the garden had become.  Got the stakes and fencing yesterday, and got halfway around before I found the hole <i>under</i> the fence.  Just about where I'd stopped reinforcing the underground barrier this winter when the weather got too bad.  Oops.  Can't finish the job properly now, as it would involve digging up black raspberry plants that are currently producing and would certainly die if their roots were exposed, but I laid rabbit wire down on the surface and up the fence and weighed it down with stones (one of which had been pushed away this morning).  I'll also finish the climbing barrier when it cools down a little.  Am just praying that the beans survive.

Went by the demo garden with the family this weekend - we will have MAJOR weeding to do this week.  At least it's supposed to be only in the 80s.  I still have to plant summer squash both here and there.  Perhaps I can justify the delay as an attempt to miss squash borer laying cycles.

Nick (now a high school graduate) started on the invasive species removal project this morning, and got a fair amount done before deciding heat prostration was imminent.  I'm looking forward to a whole new landscape back there.

Daylilies starting to bloom; lilies very soon.  Bonica roses doing splendidly this year, and the teas are relatively free of blackspot, but obviously I will have to spray them as soon as I remember to get out there early enough in the day.  Lobelia, cosmos and zinnias grown from seed are blooming; petunias not yet.  Gorgeous new coral lilies all done now.  Not sure what else is going on since I haven't been out there enough!  Feel disconnected.

Am reading another book on science and gardening (written in the UK, so stuff on native species is relevant only in theory, but technically otherwise fine); now up to genetic engineering.  Husband helpfully brought home book from library called <i>1001 Gardens You Must See Before You Die</i> which is rather depressing, not as he thought because the gardens were so perfect (I am a realist about hired help), but because I'm halfway through my life and have only seen 16 of them, so what chance do I have?  Though I think 101 is a more reasonable goal, considering the worldwide distribution and the obscene cost of travel these days."

"event","I do feel I should update, though I can't possibly list everything I've been doing in the last month, and right now I am sitting on the couch with ice on my hip because it can only take so much weeding.  But in compartments:

All my own seedlings are either in the ground (here or at the demo garden) or out on the deck waiting their turn.  Nothing under lights (though I will resurrect those in late August and start fall seedlings indoors.  I <i>will</i>).  As usual I have too many plants, at least in the vegetable department; have just tucked two extra tomatoes and four homeless tomatillos into what space I could find, and I brought home three unwanted hot peppers from the demo garden yesterday, because I am weak and cannot throw out plants.  I'll put the habaneros in the front flower bed (with the new acquisitions of butterfly weed and swamp milkweed, the gorgeous coral lilies, and all that other stuff) because they are pretty and I do not eat them.  If passing strangers wish to relieve me of them, that's perfectly fine.

I've been to two native plant sales in the last month, and along with the above milkweeds acquired some cardinal flower, a spicebush, a red buckeye, a witch hazel, two pawpaws, a sourwood tree, and a bayberry.  I think that's it.  Not buying anything else, not with all the stuff I grew and the free plants I occasionally come home with from MG activities.

Am still not done with the neighbors' project, because it has been raining so much, which is good for drought relief but always inconveniently timed for me.  This is going to be an issue, not having a sheltered spot to cut and treat wood, but one I can't think about at the moment.

Demo vegetable garden going really well; we have a wonderful group of interns this year who are working hard, and it's really looking like a garden, and there's little to do until we start harvesting, but I'm off the next two weeks anyway (training day followed by family here for Nick's graduation).  Then I can get back to friendly bickering with David over use of space.  I bet he'll sneak tomato plants in while I'm not looking.  And I will counter with clever use of winter squash seeds.  Ha ha.

I finally had my landscape BayWise certified, and am trying to help with other people's, but we have all been busy on different schedules.

That's enough for now; I'll try to keep up and say something interesting..."

"event","So I brought this plant home from the demo garden yesterday (it was in the way and had obviously seeded itself from a parent nearby).  I wasn't, embarrassingly, actually quite sure what it was, except that it was in the mint family, but it was pretty and I knew I could stick it somewhere where its prolific tendencies wouldn't matter.  Put it in a plastic bag, stuck it on the deck when I arrived home, let the cat out.  Went out again a minute later and he had his head buried in the bag, chewing happily.  Identification ho!

Removed the cat and confined him forcibly inside to wander about forlornly meowing I CAN HAZ CATNIP? PLEAZZ? while I quickly relocated the plant to the back forty (well, the back half of the half acre, under the neighbors' huge maple tree) and tucked it nicely into the ground (getting rid of about thirty garlic mustards in the process, a small fraction of what's on that knoll).  I let Gobi out again a bit later, but he didn't find the escapee.

So just now I was pulling up more garlic mustard (SCOURGE!!) and I looked over and there he was, head buried and munching.  I missed the happy scene of reunification (""MAH DRUGS!!!"" ""oh no"") but I had to stop it from continuing for hours and ending with a dead plant, so I removed him (with a sprig to keep him busy) and gave the plant its much-needed water.  It's a substantial and well-branched herb, unlike the grown-from-seed one he killed in five minutes two years ago, but I'm still not sure it'll survive him.

He smells of catnip; I smell of linseed oil (am anointing boards for neighbor's vegetable beds) and am pleasantly exhausted.  I CAN HAZ PIZZA? Y/Y/Y/Y!!"

"event","I really should update, because the Master Gardener season is in full swing again, and we had a lovely first workday at the Demo Garden today - lovely weather, with actual sun and heat (I got a little burned, in fact; with all the clouds we've had lately I'd forgotten that was possible), and a whole bunch of lovely new workers.  Funny being the Voice of Experience only a year after my own intern days.

Most of the seedling report has to do with trying desperately to keep up with transplanting - got some tomatoes and the Demo Garden marigolds in four-inch pots today - and then figuring out where to put them.  Today's transplants are out in the mini greenhouse, because it'll be warm tonight, but next week we're supposed to have nights in the 30s again, and so I guess I'll be carrying flats in and out.  And by then I will have lots more plants in larger pots.  I also started some seeds - kale and cauliflower and stuff like that, I'm not going to bother looking - that will need transplanting pretty soon because they're only in bits of starting mix tucked into egg-carton cups, instead of the Jiffy-starts I was using before, which have cohesion and breathe.  I've also used a bunch of peat pots this year, which are good except when the plant grows too fast, like the marigolds which had roots sticking out the sides of their pots.  Their current planting is in layers - Jiffy-starts inside of peat pots inside of plastic pots.  Silly, really.

I also have to start a bunch more seeds for DG plants - melons, cucumbers, etc. - but not till next week, because this is getting ridiculous.

Orange Emperor tulips are blooming; hopefully not all the petals will fall off before it gets cold again.  Grape hyacinths are out, and various little bulbs that I always have to look the names of up, and the magnolia is in full glory, preparing to clash violently with the Orange Tulips That Will Not Die in the front bed.  (I like orange, but not with purply-pink.)

Note to self: must plant some hyacinths somewhere where I don't have to bend all the way over to smell them.  The smelling season is beginning, anyway: daffodils, when brought inside; the <i>Pieris japonica</i> perfuming the front yard with honey; the cilantro I transplanted today at the DG.  Viburnum and lilac not out yet, but it won't be too long."

"event","Spring is really in full swing here: daffodils well started, maple flowers out (sneeze), Kaufmanniana tulips blooming, and almost clusianas, and the later sort of crocus.  Miniature iris have hung on longer than usual, because it's still cold... though now warm enough to plant onions out, if I had the bed finished.  Possibly tomorrow, before we leave for SC (where it is real spring, lovely gardens ahoy, and a tea plantation).  The boxelder I'm monitoring for Project BudBurst isn't leafing yet, but the buds are swelling; probably it will hit that first event while I'm gone, oh well.

My two plant-light areas are bursting with seedlings, including quite a few I transplanted into pots over the last few days.  Yes, including several tomatoes that were growing two to a plug and I just had to save instead of snipping off.  I am incorrigible when it comes to saving tomatoes.  Well, I can always give them away!  Except for the two Giant Tree cultivars that grow to ten feet high.  At least I can plant those outside the garden because the groundhogs won't be able to reach the fruit.

I think there will be enough room for everything without adding another light on the top of the stand somehow, but I can do that if I have to.  Need to buy another timer though.  I did plant some more seeds yesterday, gem marigolds I'd hand-gathered last year, because one sort of the bought seeds didn't do well (most never came up, which might have been lack of light (covered the seeds when I shouldn't have) but then some did sprout but look really tiny and pitiful. The other variety is doing great) - all those are for the demo garden, so I have to have a reasonable number.  More seeds to be sown when I get back, but the weather ought to be OK then for moving plants outdoors if they are in the mini-greenhouse or the plastic tunnel.  No luck on peas under the tunnel, by the way, at least not yet, and only tiny sprouts of lettuce etc.  Perhaps not enough water; soil dries out fast under there with the added heat.  I've pulled it off for the interim.  A learning experience, you know.  (Am quite enjoying reading Sylvia Thompson's <i>The Kitchen Garden</i> in large part because she's the sort of garden writer who admits to her mistakes.  I think I'll have to acquire a copy that's not the library's.  Also enjoying William Woys Weaver on heirloom vegetables, but his book is out of print and scarily expensive used.)

There are always some seedlings in the bunch that are more enchanting than the rest, and this time it's the roses - which will be miniature when they're mature, but are more so now (two inches high) yet distinctively rose-like; even the proto-thorns are visible.  And I'm quite fond of the little sage plants, too, with tiny leaves already full of their characteristic scent."

"event","Too much going on and no time to post.  Short summary, and then seed update.  Am going to neighbors' this afternoon to assess installation of a couple of vegetable beds; I'll do it at cost as practice while I'm getting organized about the rest.  Master Gardener meeting; passed out seeds to the other two who are growing under lights (one guy starts all our tomatoes and peppers, and will also do the tomatillos and later the eggplants (we're starting those late to try to circumvent flea beetles), yay); nice talk from an enthusiast and expert at growing tropical plants outdoors, very inspiring.  Finished the light stand - it looks bloody awful but it stands up and I've already got plants on it.

Seeds newly sown: portulaca, coleus, zinnia, lady's mantle, valerian, leeks; went ahead with the peppers, tomatoes, tomatillos and basil, a bit early but I want them up and growing before I go away at the end of the month (my neighbor will water).  For the demo garden: marigolds, tithonia and amaranth.  Sprouted: asclepias, which I just took out of the fridge a few days ago; alpine strawberries, angelica, one more rose and a few other things I already had sprouts of.  Nothing on the hand-gathered pink dianthus, which I suspect needed a cooling period or at least cooler germination temperatures.  Three of the six geranium cuttings I'm trying to root are still alive after a couple of weeks, which is a good sign.  Also under the lights: Patrick's science experiment, which has to do with growing algae in water with varying amounts of fertilizer added.  I am not quite out of space yet, thanks to the new stand, but I'm not sure what will happen when the seedlings need transplanting into bigger pots.  I do have the mini-greenhouse if it's warm enough, and also a new hoop tunnel with plastic over one of the vegetable beds.  So barring a very cold spring I should be okay."

"event","I'm feeling slightly annoyed at Pinetree - as I ETA'd, got both a phone message and an e-mail today recommending that I pot up the onions so they can keep growing, which I've done (and it's not a small amount of space they take up, either), and also saying that the Texas grower routinely ships in this week to my zip code, based on average yearly temperatures, and that this can't be changed due to the anomalies in one year.  I thanked the sender nicely, but also hinted that I thought the average temperature thing was bosh - which I do, for two reasons.

First of all, ""average temperature"" means nothing.  It was in my childhood New England that I first heard the phrase ""if you don't like the weather around here, wait five minutes"" but it's just as true of the Mid-Atlantic.  Week before last we had a day of 70 degree temps, followed two days later by an ice storm.  Where's the average temperature there?  Precisely where you'd want to plant onions, except that it never actually hit that temp, and if I'd jumped in and planted them because it was warm, they'd have had a nice coating of frozen rain soon after.  And most of the real blizzards we've had have come in March.  Not that <i>established</i> onion plants can't deal with snow and freezes, but if there's no time for them to get established, they're going to die.

Secondly, even if you believe in average temperatures, they're not warm enough here at the end of February.  I don't know where the grower gets his data, but I suspect it's out of his account books - much easier and cheaper to grow and ship a continuous stream of onions than ship to the South and then stop for a while until the more northern growers are ready, then send a whole bunch at once.  I checked my records; last year I ordered onion plants from Park's (in South Carolina, though they also ship direct from a grower), and they shipped them April 9.  Look at those dates, now:  February 25, April 9.  Slight difference.  Frankly I think one could go a little earlier than April, but February is just wacko.  And the growers are presumably in the same region, and pick the dates, so it's not explicable as South Carolina thinking Maryland is the frigid north and Maine thinking we're subtropical.

Anyway, I have a big planter full of onion seedlings sitting in my mudroom, and will for a while yet.  If they die I am so asking for my money back."

"event","Spent more time yesterday on the seed-starting shelf.  It is to laugh, really; I've done everything a bit wrong.  But this is practice, and I hope to get better.  I used to handle tools a lot more, back in the day, but I've let my competent spouse take over (division of labor, you know), and have lost most of what I'd learned.

So here's what I've screwed up on (ha ha pun) so far.  I didn't want to spend a lot on the project, so I bought cheap lumber (as it goes), pine 2x2s that were nearly all warped.  Which doesn't make measurement or straight cuts easy, and I'm not used to handling the circular saw (I think it may have been set a little off true), so the ends of the pieces are slightly angled.  Which, together with the warping, made fitting them together a challenge.  I did figure out how to glue the shelves together (the structure of each is two 30"" pieces parallel, with two 9"" pieces set a little in at right angles, holding in a 25"" piece parallel to the longer ones, in the middle), and ended up with some crude shapes that resembled what they were supposed to be.  Then I screwed them together, with deck screws that I grabbed off the Lowe's shelf that have a square grip in the top and come with their own drill bit for sinking.  Mistake: if you don't have much confidence and power on the drill, as I don't, the square strips quickly into a circle and is no longer drivable.  So some of the screws don't go all the way in.

But three of the shelves are finished, such as they are; on the fourth the cross-pieces were placed a bit off, or the middle piece is too short.  In either case I'll have to break a glue joint somehow and reset.  And then I'll decide whether the whole unit gets screwed or bolted together, and construct something that will hopefully stand up and support plant trays, which is really all I ask of it.  Next year I will build a better one.  Raised beds next!  When it's warm enough outside, that is.  Brr."

Is shipment this early the regular policy of your grower, or was this a goof?  I suppose I should have specified a shipment date, but I really didn't think anyone would consider shipping to Maryland when winter weather could still be expected.

"event","I was just reading a bunch of posts on <lj user=""metafandom""> about race in fandom, and then I got the mail, which included my new Charley's Greenhouse catalog, and somehow ended up paging through a random sample of garden catalogs I have lying around, and noting how incredibly white they are.  The people, that is - the sort of garden catalogs that sell plants tend to have pictures of... plants, and multi-ethnic plants (in the sense of the people whose cultures they are part of; the plants couldn't give a damn) are all the rage.  So I had to look at the ones that sell equipment, and frankly I don't look at the people much in those as a general rule, because they are just there to hold the tools.

But I did this time.  It's not like I hadn't noticed it before, but I'd tied it in my mind to certain purveyors: i.e. Gurney's, all those cute Caucasian infants biting into sweet corn, but the same infants populate the other catalogs as well, along with their parents.  With the sole exception of Seeds of Change (southwestern focus, emphasis on diversity of culture, involvement in community gardening, and lots of people of different colors showing up on the pages), there is perhaps one non-white person in each catalog, and usually not that.  I understand why; most of these companies are based in pretty white areas, and they don't hire models like clothing catalogs do.  I'm sure the people in the pictures (sometimes it's just an arm) are for the most part staff members or family members, or the pictures come from the manufacturers of the tools and get reused for the catalogs.  And the audience is mostly white as well... but not entirely.  Gardeners Supply, for example, publishes little vignettes about customers, and one was about a black woman who'd established a mini community garden on the roof of her building, and she was the only person of color in the whole catalog.  You'd think if they wanted more customers like her... yes, it's the quality of the merchandise that counts, but perhaps it also makes a difference whose hands are shown wearing the gloves or wielding the trowel?

I think the bias is less pronounced in gardening magazines, though it's still there.  And I suspect if I did gender analysis of the catalogs I'd find men using the heavy equipment and women planting flowers, but that's for another day."

However, to add further complications, one does need to factor in maintenance of diversity in the plants being grown (only certain varieties are good for shipping, so those are grown to the exclusion of others by the companies that supply globally) and support of local businesses.

Speaking of which, I finally have the energy to get moving again on planning mine; I have read one whole book on what to do, and have glanced through the yellow pages as step one in assessing competition (ostensibly none, though I'm sure some of the bazillion landscaping companies in our area will put in a vegetable garden if someone asks).  And I'm getting started on the carpentry projects.  Measure twice, cut once.

For focus and peace of mind as well as practicalities, I need to come up with a name soon, and that all-important one line of text that goes on the business cards, which shouldn't be a tricky thing but probably is, based on some I see around.  Or maybe I'm just too analytical: a van went by the other day that said ""[business name]: The Plumber You Deserve"" and I immediately thought, golly, what a bummer for those with low self-esteem.  But names: would it be just too granola/seventeenth-century poetry geeky to call it Vegetable Love?  I suppose people who recognize it might get the wrong impression and think I want something, either the business or their tomatoes, to ""grow vaster than empires and more slow"" which isn't exactly the point.

Anyway, I'll think about it tomorrow, as Scarlett says, though she was only peering through inexplicable fog and not ""wintry mix.""  Right now, while it's still brilliantly sunny, I'm going to walk around and consider being snarky about winter interest."

"event","Yesterday sowed (Jiffy-Starts in egg cartons, fairly efficient method) hand-gathered seeds from last year, dianthus, sage and angelica; we'll see how that goes.  I am not sure whether the dianthus is a hybrid; if so, it'll be interesting to see how the plants develop, since they may look like either parent or revert to something else.  Also planted some thyme seeds (bought, last year's) for more ground cover.  They work well around paving stones.

Nearly all the previously-sown sets have at least a few sprouts, except for Stokes's aster, which I remember as being slow, the roses, which are a gamble anyway (but who can resist trying to grow miniature roses from seed?), and the sheep's fescue, which was old seed.  All tiny little sprouts, except for the cardoons, which are of course huge, and I knew that and still put them in the same flat as the others.  Will have to move them to separate pots in another week or two.

Made little maps of the demo vegetable garden, as a whole and in sections, scanned to PDF and sent to the garden leaders.  Had to ink over the pencil drawings for scanning to work; must remember this.  Did little drawings of some of the plants on the map, although only the cardoons looked anything like the actual plant because I cannot draw but they impress and scare me.  I need to learn to draw.  I should be able to manage cartoon okra at least.

We had the one springlike day on Monday - only up to 70, at least, not up to 80 as sometimes happens in February - and then back to more seasonal temperatures, as they say; some snow yesterday but it cleared out in time for the lunar eclipse, hurray, and more snow, sleet and general yuck expected tonight and tomorrow.  I suppose I am never going to get that plastic tunnel built in the vegetable garden for winter lettuce."

Reading <i>Robbing the Bees</i> by Holley Bishop, and feeling that fascination again with a society so freakily different and yet familiar... no, not the beekeepers, them I understand (and plan to be one someday), but the bees.  Many other insects make a sort of mammalian sense to me, being individualists who spend their short lives eating, either as predators or herbivores, and then reproducing, but the communal sacrifice of bees is alien, the way they are so interdependent, so focused on little jobs; a worker bee in summer lives six weeks, half of which is spent foraging (she does jobs in the hive first), and she'll contribute enough nectar to make a twelfth of a teaspoon of honey, and perhaps a lump of pollen the size of a grain of rice, and will not do anything that any other bee couldn't do just as well.  On the other hand, it's not a bad metaphor for most of our lives, looked at from a broad perspective.

"event","For a living, at some time in the near future.  Article <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/16/AR2008011601091.html"">here</a>, excerpt under the cut:

<lj-cut>Many of the passionately locavoracious who have followed this trend find that it leads inevitably to their back yards. What could be more local than your own vegetable garden, berry patch or orchard? Once these are established, the time spent tending them is often no more than that spent scouring the county for arugula or probing a produce manager about where she gets her mache.

For others, planting a garden is too daunting a step. ""I would love to have one,"" a would-be yardavore will lament, ""but I have a full-time job."" Or kids. Or arthritis. So here's a solution: Hire somebody to install one for you and return weekly to tend it. If you're a busy person, you may already employ a cleaning service, lawn service or a landscaper. Why not a foodscaper? It's another expense, but one that pays for itself at least in part by putting food on the table, and the freshest possible food at that.

Landscapers are often asked to put in food gardens for customers. I used to do this once upon a time, and I found that instant veggie plots and apple trees brought their owners more pleasure than they got from yew hedges and junipers. In fact, if I were to nominate the job opportunity of 2008, it would be a specialty in implementing home food gardens. Call it foodscaping if you like, but I guarantee that if the practice takes hold, the apt word will emerge.
(Barbara Damrosch, Washington Post 1/17/08)
</lj-cut>

What I have to figure out is how I get there.  First steps: making sure I can handle the carpentry (someone else would have to do fences, but I would want to do raised beds, and I'd love a sideline of teaching seed-starting, which means some sort of light-shelf device), which does mean waiting on my sore back and the outdoor temperature; and the business plan and financial stuff, for which I probably need a book or two.

In other vegetable-related news, met with the demo garden leaders yesterday and am making plans for what we're going to grow this year (I am in charge of the vegetable section!).  We'll go with an ethnic/geographic division again; I know for one thing I want ""Mediterranean"" to mean all the way around the Med, and not just ""Italian."""

"event","I first began to think about petunias during my early days on the LordPeter mailing list (1999, that would have been? I expect we were gearing up for the Literary Contest, which, dammit, appears to no longer exist online.  <b>ETA:</b> <lj user=""swooop""> informs me that it still exists <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/nlbarber/lordpeter/"">here</a>), discussing <i>Have His Carcase</i>, in which during Chapter 3 one of the Resplendent's professional dancers appears wearing ""an exaggerated gown of petunia satin with an enormous bustle and a train.""  And someone on the list asked ""So what color is petunia?""  (Or, possibly, ""colour,"" as it is a decidedly transatlantic list.)

I looked into it, using the resource I had available, which was the most recent <a href=""http://selectseeds.com/"">Select Seeds</a> catalog (in those days, hand-drawn illustrations on off-white paper; now photographs), because it focused on old-fashioned varieties.  And, well, petunias come in lots of colors and always have (as long as they've been cultivated, that is).  But as far as older varieties (like <a href=""http://www.selectseeds.com/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/04100.2.5759914443542992837"">Balcony</a> and <a href=""http://www.selectseeds.com/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/04100.2.6058313435142992837"">Old-Fashioned Climbing</a>) went, we were looking at white and shades of pink and purple.  Nowadays you get hybrids in everything from <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=3702&PrevMainPage=textsearchresults&scChannel=Text%20Search&SearchText=petunia&OfferCode=V1H"">red</a> to <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=2957&PrevMainPage=textsearchresults&scChannel=Text%20Search&SearchText=petunia&OfferCode=V1H"">blue</a> to <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=1555&PrevMainPage=textsearchresults&scChannel=Text%20Search&SearchText=yellow%20petunia&OfferCode=V1H"">yellow</a> to <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=3764&PrevMainPage=textsearchresults&scChannel=Text%20Search&SearchText=wave%20petunia&OfferCode=V1H"">scary magenta that takes over your entire yard</a>.  Plus stripes and pinwheels.  But even in great-grandma's day, there wasn't just one color.

Cultivated varieties come from somewhere, of course, and in this case it's South America, where the original petunia species grew.  Nearly all the varieties we grow in gardens today are hybrids, probably originating in a cross between <i>Petunia axillaris</i> and <i>Petunia integrifolia</i>.  <i>P. axillaris</i> is white, which doesn't make one think ""petunia-colored.""  <i>P. integrifolia</i>, however, is a chirpy shade of <a href=""http://www.selectseeds.com/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/04100.7.6344996239142992837"">pink</a> with a black throat; that's my choice for ""petunia"" as in 1930s gowns.  But it might just as well have been some sort of purple.

Purple petunias - really lovely dark shades of them - are my favorites, and I think they smell the best, too, but that may be influenced by a few knock-out experiences of walking by windowboxes.  The newer hybrids are certainly tough and grow fast and don't need deadheading as much, but as so often happens they have lost a lot of their scent, which is a shame.  Bees sometimes collapse from the ecstasy of gathering nectar from those old ones.  The structure of the flower, by the way, is a good illustration of how insects have to almost burrow into a blossom to get the nectar, and get covered with pollen in the process, making the transfer to another plant easy.  And the shape is pretty much the same as all those other Solanaceae flowers.

I believe my interest in the petunia question (which probably made my fellow list-members think I was comfortably cracked) was exacerbated by my younger son's love affair with <a href=""http://www.powells.com/biblio?PID=26825&cgi=product&isbn=0394808657"">Petunia the Silly Goose</a>.  She would have to be a white petunia, of course; perhaps one of the slightly frilly ones.  And then there is Aunt Petunia; what color is she?

More on this exciting family later: heirloom tomatoes and obscene peppers."

"event","It's raining.  Sometimes I say yay! to that, and sometimes I say bugger it.  I have managed, during this brief springlike period, to get out for a short time to work on fixing the vegetable garden fence, but that's not going to happen today, nor is it going to happen over the weekend as it gets colder again.  We may have snow on Sunday.

But I did do about nine feet (working in sections, fencepost to fencepost, assuming they're about three feet apart).  For the record, this is what you do to keep groundhogs out:  dig a trench around the outside of the fence about a foot deep (or nine inches, if you're me) and wide.  Lay chicken wire (or better, rabbit wire, but I have chicken wire) horizontally in the bottom of the trench, and then vertically up the fence.  Wire it to the fence (which is made of wire as well), and fill the trench with soil.  Then when the groundhog tries to dig under the fence, he hits a barrier, and unless he starts further out and goes deeper (which he won't if there's anything else around to eat), your veggies are safe.  (Unless he goes over the fence.  This is another stage of the project.)

I did all this umpteen years ago when I built the fence, but since then the underground wire has rusted away.  (It was mostly chicken wire, which doesn't last as long as the thicker rabbit wire.)  The reason I'm doing it in sections is that along the outside of the fence are growing both undesirable plants (mostly locust saplings, and elderberry suckers on the side I haven't got to yet) and desirable ones (black raspberries and blackberries).  The former have to be removed or sawed off under the soil line; the latter have to be carefully uprooted and hung on the fence while I put the wire in, then replanted, and taking too much time over that means the roots dry out and the plant dies.

I've also got to put wire under the new part of the fence where I didn't do it before because it meant digging through gravel.  What all this means is that I'll have some lovely loose soil around the edges, and where there aren't berries growing perhaps I can plant onions, which might scare off the beasties further.  (And mint?  I don't think they like mint.)  Also should work with neighbors on filling the space between my garden and their aging former horse barn now shed-garage with some kind of semi-permanent mulch, so we're not constantly battling weeds there.  I'd plant fruit trees or shrubs, but I think it's technically their property, and in any case they do need unimpaired access for the frequent repair the shed requires.  (Historic=rotting apart.)

All this and new raised beds.  Warm winter, plz?"

"event","The topic's worth a whole book, and I believe some have been written.  Plants in this family - accurately described on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae"">Wikipedia</a> as ""characteristically ethnobotanical"" (used by humans) - include potato, tomato, capsicum pepper, tobacco, tomatillo, goji berry, mandrake, petunia... and, oh yeah, eggplant.  See the flower in the icon?  That's the typical shape of Solanaceae flowers; they just vary in size a lot.  You get little bitty yellow tomato flowers, and then you get big whomping Brugmansia and Datura.  Which are, by the way, poisonous with tropane alkaloids, one of the several alkaloids to be found in the family; another is nicotine.

Many of the genera in Solanaceae originate in South America, but some are native to other regions.  I think most of the European species are toxic to varying degrees (deadly nightshade, for example, which some idiot imported to America so we have it too), so any initial suspicion about the new crops brought over by explorers was justified.  But it's now difficult to imagine Ireland without potatoes, Italy without tomatoes... or Thailand without hot peppers, to the degree that they think they invented them.  A few hundred years introduce not only a certain degree of possessiveness, but also a whole lot of new varieties: a very adaptable family.  I gather goji berry or wolfberry, from China, has gone native in Britain?  Mostly that doesn't happen in temperate climates with these species; we have to treat them as annuals even though a lot of them are perennial but not hardy (I did see a cute little pepper tree in Belize: very cool).

Peppers are peppers here; capsicum elsewhere (which avoids the confusion with the other sort of pepper, the name presumably borrowed because of the hotness factor).  Eggplant is called that because of an early variety with white egg-shaped fruit; I believe it was imported from India, named by the Brits, exported to North America and elsewhere, and then the French word ""aubergine"" took over in Britain.  (I may be wrong about this, but I think I've seen ""eggplant"" used in 18th-century British sources.)  You can still buy the white-fruited variety; it's often called ""Easter egg plant"" and sold as an ornamental.  Eggplants also come in varying shades of purple as well as green and orange.  The plants can be lovely, as can capsicum, in all its color variety.  Tomatoes, not so much, though the fruits are handsome.  And the color variation stands there as well: <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=5411&PrevMainPage=gatepage&scChannel=Gate%20GPTomatoes&SearchText=p13.Lycopersicum&OfferCode=V1H"">rainbow tomato blends</a> are popular in seed catalogs now.

I'm going to post this now and come back later to talk about petunias and whatever else strikes my fancy."

"event","Over the weekend I made some choices about potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, shallots, and (gulp) asparagus.

I haven't ordered yet - no hurry, exactly, and this is a bigger decision than ordering seeds, which can after all sit around in good storage conditions for a year or two if you decide there's no room for another kind of beans or a groundcover.  Whereas throwing away sweet potato plants seems like a waste.  Fitting all this stuff in will entail making new beds - which we have room for, at least outside the garden fence, but it's effort.

My plan is to put everything groundhogs like inside the reinforced fence (oh yeah, have to finish that too), and plant all the onion crops outside, along with potatoes (whose leaves are poisonous).  If I go ahead with the asparagus order, one bed inside the fence will be given over to that forever.  (Wittering excised about how the number of plants in an order is either too many or too few to fit in one of my beds.  Calling Goldilocks...)

Anyway, my current choices: go with the relatively expensive potato starts at Territorial (although I'm leery of having them shipped from Oregon), because the order size allows me to have two kinds (the blue-skinned Caribe and the red-fleshed Cranberry Red, I think.  Yukon Gold I can buy at the supermarket).  I really can't be dealing with more than two pounds; not enough room.  Get sweet potatoes from Jung's again, because they are the cheapest (Pinetree, for once, is the most expensive) but get Georgia Jets (worked very well in the demo garden) instead of Centennial.  Onions, good price and selection from Pinetree (haven't settled on varieties yet, but I can get two).  Asparagus from them also, and then if it fails at least I'm not paying much.  (Jersey Supreme, an all-male variety.)  Shallots: I'll be snooty and order from Cook's so I can have French Demi-Long.

If I go ahead and order then I <i>have</i> to do the work..."

I was skimming through the <a href=""http://www.territorialseed.com/"">Territorial Seed</a> catalog, which is one of the more intellectual ones where scientific names are deemed worthy of inclusion, and it hit me - as it probably has before, but I forgot - that the genus <i>Brassica</i> does not consist of a bunch of different species so much as a bunch of different varieties and cultivars.

In other words: broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kohlrabi, and some kales are not cousins; they are all the same plant, <i>Brassica oleracea</i>.  It's just that over time, people have taken advantage of natural variations and bred this ur-cabbage to emphasize different traits: the flowers in broccoli, for example, the swollen stem in kohlrabi, the... I'm not sure how they managed brussels sprouts.  Multi-branched plants developed into one with a big central stem and lots of insignificant branches with leaf heads, I guess.

In still other words, cabbage=dogs.

Rapini (broccoli raab) is <i>Brassica rapa</i>, as is Chinese cabbage/pac choi; mustards are mostly <i>Brassica juncea</i>.  It's worth noting, too, that both beets and Swiss chard are <i>Beta vulgaris</i>.  You can do a lot with <i>Cucurbita pepo</i>, too.

Missed MG meeting today due to poorly-thought ophthalmologist appointment; after-meeting talk was on rain gardens and I'm sorry not to have heard it.  The meeting itself was on strategic planning - we have a new president and he wants to shake things up a bit, more power to him.  I did email him in response to his survey about goals.  Also emailed the demo garden co-chair and volunteered to be vegetable garden leader this year, since she'd hinted pretty strongly in her newsletter article that she wanted me to!  And she's pleased; we will meet soon to discuss plans.

I bought myself a few books in Pinetree's sale section, and was given more, so I have garden-related reading material to keep me occupied, some of it more practical than others (<i>The 12-Month Gardener</i> I do plan to put to use next year if not this year, though the frigid temperatures today are putting me off outdoor stuff).  Right now I'm reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lewis-Clarks-Green-World-Expedition/dp/1560372508/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199392889&sr=1-1"">Lewis and Clark's Green World: The Expedition and Its Plants</a>, which is of course <i>exactly</i> my cup of tea.

"event","That's right: the seed catalogs are out.  So far, Pinetree, Vermont Bean Seed, Totally Tomatoes, Park's (earliest ever! Sensing the competition!).  I've revised last year's seed list: lots of additions, embarrasingly little removed.  Really I should just toss all the seeds older than three years.  Or I suppose I could try sprouting them in damp paper towels rather than wasting the seed-starting mix.  I hate throwing out seeds almost as much as I hate throwing out plants.

I should be able to start more seeds this year, since I'm planning to build a new multi-level rack to go in the downstairs bathroom.  It says something about the use of space in this house that I'll have to change the plans and make it two feet wide instead of four (yes, you can buy two-foot shop lights; I have confirmed this).  But if I get energetic I could have two racks that size.  Of course there is garden space to be considered as well, but part of the plan is to grow lots of annual flowers so I don't have to buy them, and there's always room for those.

Am chagrined at my poor indoor plant management skills; half of what I brought in isn't going to survive.  But the cardamom and dwarf pomegranate are okay, and the geraniums are alive if really lanky; I'm trying to root cuttings to start over.  I swear something <i>ate</i> the pineapple sage, but darned if I can figure out what.

"event","Have been quiet here due to not much going on.  We've had a week of on-and-off rain, which is grand, although since it's really just the normal autumn rainfall it does nothing to make up for that 10-inch deficit we had at summer's end.  Trees still hanging on to leaves longer than usual, but many of them are now turning brilliant colors and all at once.  I'd thought the display would be pitiful to nonexistent, but the maple in our front yard is as glowingly red as usual (a week or two late) and the other red maples that usually turn earlier than ours are mostly going at it now.  Not to mention all the yellows and oranges and shades thereof.  I went for a walk in Rock Creek Park yesterday and it was lovely; all those mixed leaves underfoot, oaks and poplars and beeches and so forth all together, is one of my favorite sights.  Even the mix I raked up along the edge of the driveway today was pretty, with our own leaves and those that blew in from elsewhere in the neighborhood.

The sweetgum in the back is in the stage where most of the leaves are yellow tinged with orange, a few are still partly green, and a few are bordering on red.  And the needles of the dawn redwood (which is tall enough now to look like a sentinel at the back of our property) are that impressive burnt orange shade, that's subtly different enough from brown to make it clear that the tree's not dying, it's just deciduous.

Raking leaves will be more of a multi-part process than usual this year.  I try to let a lot of them lie in place and decompose, perhaps after running over them with the lawn mower where that's appropriate, but some get raked and put in the compost.  Compost 101: you need browns (for carbon) and greens (for nitrogen), and I often fail at browns.  I insist on composting everything from the kitchen that's allowable (i.e. no meats or dairy products (except, like, cheese on vegetables) but just about everything else), as well as much of the garden waste (green), and often don't have anyway near enough dead leaves or dried grass (mulched clippings let lie, much better for nutrition of lawn) or other brown stuff to compensate.  I have considered shredding newspaper or other paper and adding that in.  Pulled a lot of the stuff from the spinning bin today (had to get help to flip it over, way too heavy), and it was not nearly finished despite being in there for months.  I spread it on the tomato beds and will let it settle over the winter; should be ready to dig in in spring.  But I've got to work on the method more.

Also cut out some of the English ivy that's taking over under the holly.  I hate working under there, as I inevitably get stabbed from all directions by the pointy leaves and the remains of greenbrier vines I cut off this summer, and I couldn't reach all the ivy.  Nasty stuff.  And I saw Japanese honeysuckle growing on the lilacs, but that will have to wait for another day.

Anyway, cleanup progresses, and I am working on taking care of and distributing the plants I brought inside a month or so ago, before they all wither from neglect.  Houseplants and I don't really get along; this is in part because I find them too fussy (something else to keep clean, for goodness sake, never mind the light and soil requirements, unless they're the kind you can't kill and then they're just boring), and in part because our house just isn't set up for them, what with the narrow windowsills and the lack of horizontal space and the wrong light and the cat that eats leaves, although most of this set would taste unpleasantly strong and he's left them alone so far.  But I'll do my best."

"event","We had our first serious frost last night - there have been several light ones before - so I was rushing around this morning trying to find something to scrape ice off the windshield (used a credit card, as the proper scraper is hiding in the shed somewhere).  This should melt everything not truly hardy that's still growing.  I pulled up the tomato plants a few days ago; peppers and basil went at the first touch of frost; celeriac and onions should be pulled and stored now; leeks should hold on a while longer, but since I have so many I may bring some in for storage.  Yesterday it occurred to me to clip some of the Bonica roses that were still blooming lustily (in November!) along with what's left of the late flush of lavender flowers, and put them in the dehydrator.  I looked this morning, and laughed at how much the roses shrank.

The dehydrator has been getting more of a workout than it usually does (to my shame - though I don't like using it over the summer, since it either adds heat to the house or runs inefficiently in the humid outdoors).  I dried all the decent-looking hot peppers, and plan to pulverize them into a sort of cayenne powder, although only a few are actual cayenne peppers.  Also I was given a branch of stevia from the demo garden, and dried all that, so we have sweet leaves to put in our tea.

Sunday was the annual Rake Up Walnuts Day (we have a huge black walnut tree in the back yard, and walnuts underfoot all fall) - a moderate crop only this year, but it still took well over an hour to clean them up.  Looking up to be sure the nuts had all fallen, I realized that the tree still has most of its leaves, which is truly unusual for this time of year.  And so do many of the other trees around here; also the color changing is way off schedule.  This is more symptomatic of this year's odd weather patterns than of the warming trend directly, but I think the latter helps produce the former.

As I said over at the other journal, I took the <a href=""http://www.baywise.umd.edu/"">BayWise</a> course through the extension office, and will (probably in the spring) be part of a group that surveys the properties of interested participants to certify them, using <a href=""http://www.hgic.umd.edu/_media/documents/publications/bw1.qxd.pdf"">the Yardstick</a> (which will obviously have to be adjusted if we ever go metric).  I have to get certified myself first.  Using the old Yardstick, I scored (by my own estimation) 38, just over the required 36; using this new one, I scored 60.  So we are clearly lowering the bar.  Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile way of looking at environmental friendliness, whether you are in the Chesapeake Bay watershed or not; try it!  (If you don't have a lawn, the first link lists parallel publications down at the bottom.)

Master Gardener stuff definitely winding down for the year - one more demo garden workday to get the withered tomato plants and such out, butterfly habitat done as of yesterday (though we did find another huge patch of crown vetch and Japanese honeysuckle at the last minute; will still be there to attack in the spring).  Quite a lot to get done at home, of course."

However, I went ahead and tried to trim the parts that looked trimmable - cutting away the fibrous outside to get at the softer interior - until the knife slipped and I cut my finger.  Not badly, but bloodily, so I gave up where I was and boiled the few bits I had.  Later I finished the trimming of one and tasted it... well, I can see how it would be good under ideal conditions, with a flavor reminiscent of artichoke, but this piece was still too stringy, and sour to boot, though that may have been the lemon juice in the water.

"event","Must remember that the space I'm trying to landscape under the dogwood is dry naturally and more so when nature doesn't cooperate.  I'll consider adding some compost, and make sure it's mulched, but if I'm going to plant things that need moisture (and most shade plants do) I absolutely have to water it.  Which should not be hard considering how close it is to the rain barrel.  Have lost rhododendron there this year, and possibly some perennials, including one of the wintergreens.  Wintergreen does not grow well here, except when given perfect conditions and babied.  Have now lost two of the three plants I bought and all but possibly one of the seedlings (which will die by spring).  How about not growing it?  Catmint, however, doing beautifully there.  Also abelia shrub and cherry laurel (aside from whatever is hole-punching the leaves).

Other under-tree areas should be planted in something other than weeds.  Even if it is vinca minor.

Either get rid of the old claw-foot tub sitting in the back of the house, or damn well plant something in it, even if it makes me look like Daisy Mae.  That whole space needs to be landscaped, either with hardscape as a trash/recycling area, or with plants, or both.  It is just junk and weeds now, and looks awful.  I don't care if we're going to dig it up soon to put in support pillars for that balcony.  ""Soon"" is a long time later around here.

Now that the house has been painted (""soon"" after it needed it), I can plant in the areas by its foundation that have been ignored because the painters would step on the plants and kill them.  This includes the bed under the hydrangeas, and the space under the back window that now holds only daylilies, mutant daffodils, and various weeds.  (The daffodils are mutant because of a previous painting job, I think, that got old lead paint into the soil.  The most recent scrapings are less likely to be lead-infused, but still the soil ought to be replaced.)

The raised bed by the southwest wall my handy husband built a few years ago to plant hops in (I moved the hops last year to a place that actually gets sun in the summer - he neglected that factor in his calculations) has also lain fallow this year (=weeds) but must be used for something.  How about a cucumber frame, she said ambitiously, or a proper Victorian hotbed?  I would love to do that; we'll see if I find the time and carpentry skills this fall.  And then it could be de-framed in the summer for shade annuals or something.

Of course I was going to put my little collection of broken tulips (=2) in there when they arrive, but I think I can put them in the mini-bed by the porch instead.  Another space that is too dry.  Have already killed one clematis and the other doesn't look too great.  Vines that don't need much water?  Will investigate.

More later."

"event","Had more time than expected today after attending produce-related theatre production, so got some transplanting done: scarily aggressive variegated mint from leaky windowbox to ""floor"" of veg garden (will probably decide later this was a bad idea, but the peppermint and spearmint currently resident haven't invaded the beds too badly); darling baby starfruit tree to larger pot; scented geraniums to other pots, all to be brought in when temperatures fall again.  Also emptied old zinnia pots for use by cardamom and dwarf pomegranate, which have to come inside as well (where they will all go, there is a question); have let sit for a while so the ant population vacates.

This time of year is always good for assessments of various sorts, as we head inexorably into bleaker winter weather (though God knows what that will be like this year.  Slightly more conventional, I hope).  I usually do review what I've managed garden-wise and what I mean to do better next year, but this is the first time I've tried writing it all down.  So bear with me, probably over the course of several posts.

<lj-cut text=""Let's start with the vegetable garden, then"">The most obvious task to be accomplished before next spring is groundhog-proofing the vegetable garden fence.  This will involve digging down a foot or so outside the fence and installing either chicken wire or rabbit wire from nine inches or so above ground, down underground and bending outwards, where I haven't already done it (including those bits where the ground is compressed gravel and ground stone, that I was too lazy to dig through last spring and that the groundhog got through with minimal effort) or where the older installation has disintegrated or been dug through.  The fence may also have to be made higher in spots.  After all that, the groundhog (singular, I think; at least I never saw more than one in there at a time, though certainly whole families of them live nearby) will still manage to get in, so I should think also about hog-proofing individual beds, perhaps putting in stakes and wrapping soft fencing around, and trying to put the most tempting crops in there.

Groundhogs do not seem to like:  onion relatives in general (and those could, potentially, go outside the fence), peppers, sorrel, celeriac, cardoons, potatoes, mature squash plants, basil, cilantro, hops.  They munch happily on kale and other leafy but not bitter or sour greens, bean plants, tomatoes (though not usually the leaves), small squash plants, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, sweet potato leaves, and probably several other things I've put out of mind.  Some categorization seems called for.  I can also try the hot pepper spray again.

The other task to be accomplished early next spring is installing the drip irrigation system I bought this year.  Piping water through to the garden has been wonderful, but it'd be even better not to have to stand around with a hose.  I may install a hose hanger nonetheless.

Putting in more groundcovers outside the beds may cut down on weeding - certainly fewer weeds grew this year where the mints are established.  Where weeds grow I really need to yank them more often, and keep up with elderberry eradication.

I must do better in planting seasonal crops - spring, summer, fall - which takes organization... and luck.  Fall crops, if I'd planted them in August as advised, would not have done terribly well what with the drought and high temperatures.  It's probably too late now, though who knows.  I do have self-seeded cilantro and basil coming up, first time I've seen that in the fall, but what I really ought to have done is planted succession crops.  As usual, I didn't.  One row now, another in a week, etc. - means remembering to save the space, and knowing what's likely to germinate given temperatures.

Did I plant too many leeks?  Most of them remain to be harvested, but they should last into the winter just fine.  In general, I need to be more efficient about harvesting and using crops; don't let the basil go to flower, but cut it off and make pesto.  Et cetera.  I'm lazy about it, especially when it's hot out.  Some plants are allowed to be simply decorative, and I include hot peppers in this category - I'll never use all I grow, and they are so pretty, even the varieties not designated ornamental - but I don't like wasting what can be eaten.

I think I'll turn one of the bins I used for potatoes into a compost bin next year, for throwing stuff into when I'm working in the garden.  My fancy Australian compost spinner works well, except that the squirrels chewed a big hole in the top immediately and that it gets heavy to turn if I don't empty it, which I haven't been.  Initial hot composting in there, perhaps, and frequent emptying from the bottom to sit longer before adding to beds.  I will do this later in the fall, I promise.

The only other notes I have are to perhaps redo the hop trellises so the plants don't fry against the shed roof, and to plant rosemary down there somewhere (outside the fence would be fine, as long as I fix any drainage issues), since the space is wind-protected and less likely to freeze and thaw than the herb bed out front.  I have two plants ready to go in after a summer up on the deck, and lavender as well.

I'll note too that growing eggplant in pots on the deck did avoid any bug issues (usually they are gobbled to death by flea beetles), though I suspect the plants produced less fruit because of root restrictions (more than dead plants, though).  Midget melons also grew well enough in a container (I harvested the last of them today, and pulled the vines out), though I might consider growing them on a trellis in the garden next year, more of them so as to get a larger crop.  Or else not growing them at all, since they're bound to be killed by bugs.

Anything deer and groundhogs don't eat could also be grown in nominally-flower beds, as long as it's fairly tidy and attractive.

I think that's enough for now; will proceed through the rest of the property in later posts."

"event","Scott Aker is a horticulturalist at the National Arboretum who writes a regular question-and-answer gardening column for the Washington Post.  He spoke to our Master Gardener class this past winter, and I'm generally impressed by him, not only because he answered my question about magnolia scale a few years ago in the paper.  Anyway, he wrote something interesting about global warming in <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/12/AR2007091200603.html"">this week's column</a>, which I will reproduce under the cut:

<lj-cut><i>I read about efforts to redraw the lines in the USDA Hardiness Zone map. I wonder if global warming may affect what plants we can grow here, with some warmer-climate plants surviving winters but trees and shrubs from northern areas not faring so well. I purchased two camellias and worry that they may not be winter hardy in spite of all the talk of climate change.  Also, is it better to use cool-season varieties of grass, or should we all be switching to warm-season types such as zoysia?</i>

<b>It's too simplistic to think that global warming will result in drastic changes in what we can grow. This will be a slow process that will be limited to a large extent by extremes. Both global warming and the USDA Hardiness Zone map deal in climate as opposed to weather extremes. Temperatures may, on average, become warmer, but the extremes in temperature may be no different.

As this past winter bore out, global warming may actually make winter hardiness more of an issue. As the weather becomes more erratic, we may find ourselves going from a balmy subtropical spell to a significant cold snap in no time at all, and more frequently. I saw plants injured by 10 degrees Fahrenheit last winter that had not been injured by minus-10 degrees in the winter of 1995-96. Consistently cold conditions are not as hard on plants as wild swings from warm to cold and back.</b>

(And, he goes on to say, we shouldn't switch to zoysia either, because it will continue to go dormant and brown in the winter.  This is a matter of taste as well as other factors, but tall fescue is probably still the best bet here, even though what we really need is a lawn grass that works for our in-between climate.)</lj-cut>

This is one of the best short statements I've seen of this particular practical aspect of climate change.  In other words, it's not just a matter of Maryland gradually becoming North Carolina; it's a matter of things getting harder for everybody, as we have less and less idea what to expect.  I'm just afraid it'll mean more of everyone growing the same five plants, because you can't kill them with any weather extreme.

Another article from the Post, which <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR2007091401969.html"">I'll let you read</a> if you wish; it's a bird-watcher's view of the movies, with complaints about birds or bird noises showing up wrongly in movies set where those birds don't live.  It is <i>exactly</i> the sort of thing I think about, if not the first time I see a movie, the second time, except not so much with birds.  But I should start a list of plant howlers (they're usually blurred in the background, so it's hard to tell, but sometimes you can see something blooming that shouldn't have been that time of year, if not a species that's out of its native habitat).

I planted an <i>Itea virginica</i> (Virginia sweetspire) yesterday, along with a Monarda and two Baptisias, part of my effort to get more native plants into my landscape.  Also transplanted a divided daylily and a couple of random sedums.  It's finally fall, temperatures in the 70s, breezy and dry.  Hurray!  Well, except for the dry part.  But nice to work outside without sweating buckets."

"event","Some time ago I was given a charming little book, <i>Climates in Miniature</i>, written in the 1950s by T. Bedford Franklin, a British gardener and amateur scientist, which deals with a series of observations and experiments on things like soil temperature and percolation through different types of soil.  He takes seriously (but verifies) various bits of country wisdom, and one habit he finds to be useful if seemingly contradictory is watering before a rain, especially if there has been no rain for a long time.  A decent watering breaks down the crust that forms on the soil surface and lessens the degree of run-off when the rains come (especially if they come hard).

So we might have some rain tonight, if a particular weather system does its thing (it will, at any rate, be cooler after today), and therefore I went out to water this morning.  Not very thoroughly, but I hope enough to break the crust.  There was some rain while we were gone, and right after we got back, but none since, and not nearly enough to break the drought.  (Drought is a funny thing to discuss when you've just been out West, in places where months go by without a drop of rain, but it's all in what you're used to, or rather in what your native flora is used to, and the stuff you planted in your garden or fields, and the degree to which you've got irrigation systems set up.  We have had rain this summer, but we are definitely deep in drought, and it is killing agriculture along with people's lawns and gardens.)

One of the many bits of advice I dispense blithely at plant clinics, but have trouble following myself, is ""water deeply but infrequently"" (because this gives the plants incentive to form significant root systems, which help with drought resistance and with stability).  It can be rephrased as ""put in a drip irrigation system, stupid, if you don't want to stand there with a hose on each plant for twenty minutes once a week.""  Needless to say, I have not done this.  So I tend to water shallowly and not as frequently as necessary, and hope for rain that doesn't come.

I would provide a list of the plants that have already succumbed or are likely to, but it would just be depressing.  Let me just say that the fungus disease my new rhododendron developed on its flowers this spring is not going to be an issue next year.  I'm thinking of putting an <i>Illicium mexicanum</i> in its place - except that it needs that elusive ""consistently moist, well-drained soil"" that I don't have, or not without standing with a hose for twenty minutes once a week.  Or twice, for the ""consistent"" part."

"event","My most common reactions to the plant life of Northern California were bemusement and a frustrating sense of familiarity, with occasional snatches of satisfaction akin to putting together kindergarten sentences in a foreign language.  In other words, I was an ignoramus, which is a fine thing to be until you attach the Master Gardener label to your chest and people start expecting you to know what you're talking about.  I suck at plant ID in the East, OK?

Aside from the looming ever-present conifers, the first plants I noticed at Yosemite (during a pre-dinner jet-lagged walk) were lupines and what I later identified as <a href=""http://www.swcoloradowildflowers.com/White%20Enlarged%20Photo%20Pages/veratrum%20tenuipetalum.htm"">corn lilies</a> (not in flower).  The understory level of the forest is rich in species, varying from one area of the park to another (thousands of feet in elevation difference), and even with wildflower and tree guides (which I didn't buy till our third day there) I couldn't reliably identify more than half of them, and only managed to keep ten percent in mind at a time.  ""Dogwood,"" I would say happily at Tuolomne Sequoia Grove, and indeed they were <a href=""http://www.paghat.com/pacificdogwood.html"">Pacific dogwoods</a>, pretty much past bloom, but easily identifiable by leaf, even if the berry structure is quite different than the Eastern variety.  But then there'd be a groundcover plant I had no idea about... and this was in a national park where I could be pretty sure the plants were native.  Forget ID-ing anything in San Francisco.  Except eucalyptus, of course, which shows up promiscuously growing in coastal state parks as well, as long as someone lived on the land once.

On the Tioga Road, driving to our first long hike to North Dome, we passed a nature walk area for conifers, and I learned Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, western white pine, and a tentative sense of some firs, and pointed them out as we walked along (completely coniferous forest, at that altitude).  Then we went down into the Valley, and all those trees disappeared and were replaced by Ponderosa pines and a bunch of others.  I thought live oak was holly when I first saw it (the live oak leaves I'm used to look more like magnolia, not that it grows reliably this far north), and I only got used to madrone halfway through the trip.  Some day I will return, at least to Yosemite and to Point Reyes, spend longer and walk slower, and really get familiar with each area's indigenous flora.  We moved around so much, and each place has a different set of plants, with seemingly only a few ferns in common.

Point Reyes was my discovery point for coastal plants.  There are lots and lots of these, but the two that stand out in my memory are <a href=""http://sunnygardens.com/garden_plants/carpobrotus/carpobrotus_0578.php"">ice plant</a> and <a href=""http://www.calflora.net/bloomingplants/bushlupine.html"">bush lupine</a>.  Ice plant grows all over the slopes and rocks near the shoreline, and I identified it by name right away, even though <i>Carpobrotus chilensis</i> shares only a family with <a href=""http://www.plantoftheweek.org/week260.shtml""><i>Delosperma cooperi</i></a>, hardy ice plant, which I grow here.  The California version is larger and more aggressive, and hardy only in zones 9 and 10.  Anyway, the whole trip made me more appreciative of succulents (which I already cultivate happily) and I mean to explore which other ones I can grow.

The bush lupines I discovered after we'd left the beach and climbed up a ridge just inland, and I came across this four-foot shrub with those distinctive radiating leaves - but it was a shrub, with a woody stem and everything, and I didn't think it could possibly be in the same clan as the lupines I'm used to (if I could grow them here) or the ones I'd seen in the Yosemite forest.  But a bit further on was another, and it was blooming, a perfect purple lupine.  I said wow a lot, and then later that day we went to Point Reyes Lighthouse, which is the windiest spot on the west coast, and there along with the ice plant and other tough clingers-to-rocks (and one surprising cactus in the lee of a cliff), and an informative sign telling us that lighthouse keepers have <i>tried</i> to have gardens, but all the carrot seeds blew away, were <a href=""http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=luar"">smaller bush lupines</a>.  Again, I did not believe in them until I saw them elsewhere, this time in flower (yellow).  <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/archive/redw/y-lupine.htm"">This site</a> tells me it's an unwelcome invasive in the northern parts of the state; as a foreigner, I enjoyed it.

I'd better post this now, and think of more to say later."

No action on any of them.

1/23: After the orientation stuff, we were supposed to whip through introductory botany, plant nomenclature, hardiness zones, and a bunch of forsythias, and the Rose of Sharon That Will Not Die. A few ancient daffodils. That's about it. I suppose all we've lost, aside from those foundation mistakes and the trees, was a white lilac, red cedar and flowering quince that went with the addition, lots of weed trees in the back, and a few on the borage, and then on the oregano right next door, lots of honeybees. I would love to know where to put one's feet, though.

Started some more seeds - cucumber, okra, melon, basil, zinnias, parsley, something else I'm blanking out on - which can hopefully be transplanted directly into the ground or pot or wherever. Acquired one more tomato plant than I really want one of now).

Massive amounts of weeding to do this weekend. Weeding Weekend. Including cutting down the ailanthus sprouts and the five-foot black walnut that came up at some point try comparisons between one or both of those and a conventional peat-based starting mix."

But we might have guessed that, by the name.  A great size for the home garden, actually, because of both weight and time; usually I don't harvest melons, because something bad happens to the plant before they mature.  We ought to get another today or tomorrow.

Also, I am brewing up a hot pepper/garlic concentrate for spray that may just possibly make the groundhog have second thoughts about biting into every single tomato it can reach.  Must just remember to wash them very well before we eat them.

"event","...though I will probably try it at some point in my life nonetheless.  My post about plant loss was really about the reactions of the homeowner/amateur gardener; obviously if you're trying to make a living off plants their loss has a financial bite that is altogether different from ""I spent 20 bucks on that rose; how dare it die?""  Similarly, when you're growing vegetables to sell it's quite different from growing them as a nutritional and taste supplement for your family and not even really depending on them.

There is always a point in the summer when I get really depressed about gardening in general.  Sometimes it has to do with weeks of oppressive hot and humid weather - we've actually been pretty lucky about that this year - or with drought or pest problems.  We've still had no rain, though I am holding out hopes that our scheduled house painting next week will open the skies (although not really.  Could we have it before then, please?).  And the groundhog is still in my vegetables every day, chomping away - I caught him in there yesterday, and this time he got out <i>under</i> the fence.  Really I have little chance of keeping him out this year, so I might as well forget about beans and kale and sweet potatoes.  Also my new cucumber plants are gone - he must be hungry! - and about a third of the ripening tomatoes get bites taken out of them (though that is probably birds as well).  I do have lots of tomatoes anyway.  And the potatoes should be okay, along with the great onion, leek, shallot and garlic harvest, and probably the new summer squash plant, and the peppers (though suffering from lack of water), and the celeriac, and the massive cardoons.  And the basil.

Today I will make more salsa out of the tomatoes (and onions and hot peppers, and tomatillos from the Demo Garden - brought home lots of stuff from there today) and perhaps some tomato-basil soup.  We ate a few of the little eggplants in a stir-fry over pasta the other night - very nice.  And I've got two melons about three inches in diameter (and some smaller ones as well) - I don't <i>count</i> on those, because so much can go wrong, but maybe we'll get to eat them.

So I am trying to look on the positive side, and keep watering, and not let the demons chomp on my mood."

"event","Am still suffering the depredations of the groundhog (or more than one, but I think I've identified an individual, seen repeatedly).  I've blocked likely entry points over the fence, but more bean plants were chomped off this morning.  Am considering mounting spikes in the top of the gate.

Since seeing the pathetic remains of all those sweet potato stems, <i>inside</i> the floppy bin where before there had been a sea of glossy deep green leaves, I've been thinking about plant loss and what it feels like to a gardener.  It is, in no circumstance, the same as the loss of a work of art, not to mention a child or even a pet, because plants can nearly always be replaced (though not always with an equivalent), and although they do possess some personality and individuality, and can be beloved, our emotional ties to them are less.  It should be more like the breaking of an appliance, or damage to a building: something that can be fixed.

However, the death or maiming of a plant is often more personal than that - this is a living thing, after all - and can hit hard.  Some of the categories of loss I've experienced:

Sudden death of a mature tree whose youth I didn't witness.  The shade is missed, along with a certain force of presence, but the reaction tends to be mostly annoyance and disappointment with a core of sadness, and then involvement in selecting a replacement.  But the empty spot resonates for a while.

Death of shrubs and perennials I bought and planted.  The dollar signs loom large here, and the memory of pretty flowers or other attributes.  Length of acquaintance makes a difference, though sometimes it makes the loss more difficult and sometimes one feels it was about time, especially if the plant was growing too large for its setting or just didn't look right there.  Can be devastating, though.

Loss of perennials I grew from seed.  This gets personal.  Again, I mind it sometimes more, sometimes less, but the degree of effort involved is always important, and how long ago it was grown.  It actually hurts more when the plant dies in its first year and I haven't even seen it bloom yet.  Slow growers and difficult germinators are more missed, because it'll be harder to try again.  I think it's not the plant itself so much as the process that I mourn here, because I don't feel the same way at all about the same kind of plant bought at a nursery.  Even though it costs more to buy a plant than to grow it.

Loss of annual flowers.  Shrug, mostly.  Pull 'em up, start over.  Though again, annoyance about the wasted time or money.

Loss of food-producing plants.  Somehow feels like even more of an investment than the purely ornamental perennials, even though most of them are annuals and will have to be replaced next year.  Nurture with an expectation, I guess - a very visceral expectation.  Mm, sweet potatoes.  Different than mm, zinnias.

Loss through disease or insect infestation.  A certain amount of guilt here - what could I have done to prevent it?

Loss through animal attack.  Grr.  Illogically, I feel a lot more animosity toward groundhogs, rabbits, and deer than I do toward caterpillars and slugs (although squash borers fit somewhere in between).  They are all just doing what nature tells them to.  But the animal damage tends to be greater (unless the insects come in large groups), more sudden, and... easier to imagine, maybe?  To identify with?  And one doesn't think in terms of outwitting an insect.

Groundhogs, though.  I want to say HA HA I HAVE FOOLED YOU.  YOU WILL NEVER EAT MY SWEET POTATOES AGAIN.  Or lop the tops off bean plants, or chomp big holes in ripe tomatoes.  And I'm quite sure they feel the same way about me, in reverse."

"event","Also in bloom just now:  elderberry (J. is making elderflower wine!), hostas, heucheras, balloon flower, hydrangeas just coming out, a new flush of dianthus and magnolia.  <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i> in magnificent bloom all over, making me wish I had one (I am also reading William Bartram admiring them all over the South), but my hybrid shrubs also repeat bloom at this point, usually, though not as spectacularly as in the spring.  One set of the verbascums (which are a mullein, I guess, with pinkish flowers) is popping up nicely into bloom, while the other set look to be dying.

The extreme heat and dryness are having generally bad effects (it will cool off tonight, thank goodness).  Should be watering more than I am.  It's not drought but disease that's killing the roses, though drought doesn't help.  At least the Bonica shrubs are happy; I should really not be responsible for tea roses, though.

There <i>is</i> a groundhog still getting into the garden - <i>over</i> the fence, 'cause I saw him.  Must add chicken wire on top now.  Luckily, he doesn't seem to be going for young bean plants this time; he's eating sweet potato foliage and (damn him) chomping off the tops of the sunflower seedlings.  And the kale, but I so don't care about the kale anymore.  But grr.  I am more on the side of the Macgregors just now than I can tell you, though I suspect groundhog pie would not be delicious.

Oh (there is an association for you), the camomile is in bloom as well.  Very charming; too tall for a ground cover.  Also mint is blooming, and coriander.  Nectar-collectors still v. happy.

I have been seeing Red Admiral butterflies about more than usual, so I looked them up, and it turns out hops is one of the host plants for the caterpillars.  Good!  Our hops are aggressive enough that they can take some chewing."

It's very hot - about due, really; we've been lucky so far - and the transplanted echinacea I thought I'd watered enough to save are looking peaked again.  We are saving enough in the two rain barrels to last quite a way into the period between rains, at least.  More thunderstorms perhaps on Wednesday.

Rudbeckias blooming now - the ones on the deck seem to be green-eyed Susans, which is interesting.  Lilies still going, though on the downswing.

Rescued the kale (the poor groundhog-chomped kale) from a plague of harlequin cabbage bugs by dumping them into soapy water.  Works well for the slower-moving type of insect.  For the cucumber beetles, who are fast, I've had an unexpected trap crop - an unidentified weed growing in the path between beds that I almost uprooted until I saw all the little stripy guys all over it.  They seem to prefer it to the cucumber plants, which are about five feet away.

"event","I have so much to learn about botanical anatomy and physiology.  Like, for example, why is it that most of my garlic plants are now turning brown and flopping over, having developed their bundles of tasty garlic underground, but some of them are standing up tall and forming bulbs at the end of the stems?  How, in monoecious plants (pistilate and staminate flowers separate but on the same plant), does one reliably tell male and female flowers apart when they don't have really obvious differences?  My melon plant has lots and lots of male flowers and a few female ones that are easily distinguished by the swelling at the base that will, given luck, turn into a melon.  But on the eggplant, I have difficulty telling which of the flowers will simply wither up and die and which will produce fruit, since the fruits grow from the <i>inside</i> of the flower.  (And yes, I have several cute little eggplants now.  Yay!)

Have been having fun watching pollinators work.  Would also like to learn which insects prefer which flowers.  The self-segregation is interesting - in the herb bed, for example, there are many bumblebees on the lavender and a few on the borage, and then on the oregano right next door, lots of honeybees.  I would love to know where my honeybees live, too; I don't see a lot of them, but they are around, and I don't know anyone in the close vicinity who has a hive.  Not that they can't live wild.  I wonder what oregano honey would be like?

The vegetable garden has reached the pleasant stage of jungliness where everything tangles together, especially in the half where the tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes and hops dominate, but I also have various flowers trying to make their way up through the madness of vines, including what will eventually become nice tall sunflowers, and a few hyacinth beans, and some amaranth.  The hops are everywhere; I keep having to pull them out of the tomato plants, and they have infiltrated the sweet potato bed and are all over the fence.

The cat has decided that under the huge cardoon leaves is a nice place to nap, although he gets annoyed when I shut the gate and leave him in there.  I expect he could get over the fence okay, but he prefers to meow a lot and be let out.

"event","One of the rudbeckias in the planter on the deck had aphids all over its stem yesterday (brown ambrosia aphids, I think).  I spent about twenty minutes watching a little predatory wasp swoop in, crawl up and down the stem, select an aphid as prey, grab it and wrestle it into the right position, and then zoom off again.  The wasp (I don't know the species) was about a quarter of an inch long, if that, and the aphids about half its size.  There were baby aphids, too, and at one point the wasp grabbed one of those; I think it was getting tired.  But it would have wanted the big ones, because what it was doing (or so my brief research tells me) was taking them back to its nest - her nest, since this is the female's job - stinging them into paralysis, and laying an egg on each.  The larvae will eat them when they hatch.

(I am assuming this was all the same wasp at work - I mean, I couldn't tell one from another in a line-up.  But the timing seemed about right for the operation, and they are solitary insects.)

This is such a cool thing to watch (for a plant geek, anyway) because it makes real the standard IPM adage that you don't always have to grab for the spray bottle when you see pests, that in fact sometimes this is counterproductive (many aphids, in particular, are immune to pesticides, but their predators aren't), and that in every case it is worthwhile to do some research first, and observe what's going on.  The wasp (and possibly friends - I saw a minute pirate bug as well) did for at least two-thirds of the adult aphids on that stem; a few are left, but they're not hurting the plant, and they may well vanish today as well.  But they don't just vanish - which is often the limit of our observation - they are removed, and rather dramatically at that."

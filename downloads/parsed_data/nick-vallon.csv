"event","So now that im all settled into my new place i figured i give you all an update.

First off, my classes are really fun. Im taking seven classes, its alot, but not that bad seeing as how they all pertain to my major. 

Here are my classes:
-Professions in Theater
-Voice and Articulation(i need this one)
-History of American Musical Theater
-Theater Production Seminar
-Stagecraft
-Acting 2
-Makeup(my least favorite) 

Not only that but i have to work all the shows, so im excited about that because i really just want to get back on stage.

Everyone here is really nice and older people dont look at me weird when i call them sir or mame, they prefer it.  Also one of my professors is good friends with Nonalee Davis(how cool is that?).

My roomates are cool, one of them used to the be the manager for the basketball team, the other is a six foot eight basketball player.

I miss everybody, even if i dont say it, but i love it up here in the mountains and the snow.  I think ever since i came up to drama camp around here i fell in love with this place.  Only down side is stuff like nice movie theaters arent around, the movie theater here only excpets cash and is cheapier looking that searstown theater.

Just so you all know, your more than welcome to come and visit.  Ill take you running in the mountains(there aint nothing like it, escpecailly with the ipod on).

Mrs. Davis is coming over tomorrow and taking me out.  That will be hard since i havent seen her since Mr. Davis passing, and i get oddly emotional when i think about that.  On a lighter note hopefully she wont let the dogs out.

Until next time my friends, keep safe, and ill be thinking about.

Here is a quote to finish this entry:

""And I knew just as surely, just as clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last.""

So here is whats up.

-Moving to North Carolina in January to go to WCU.
-Still work at the YMCA.
-Going to Germany next week(first time every going to the other side of the pond).
-Writing a few things and hopefully will have one done soon.
-Maybe doing a triathlon(an easy level one).

Thats the big things.  As always if you want to talk, call me, im always up for the conversation.

"event","I have seen all the movies i wanted to from last year except Letters From Iwo Jima and Pans Labyrinth, so i feel i could make my list now.

1.The Departed-I loved this movie.  I never was a fan of Goodfellas or Casino so i wasnt thinking i would like it alot.  But it rocked.  Im a big fan of everybody who was part of this movie.  It just had everything.

2.Children of Men-This is what movies are all about.  When i go to the movies i want to be sucked into the enviroment and boy was i during this flick.  The way the director showed the future was amazing and again a A+ cast delivered.

3.The Last Kiss-Out of all the movies on this list I proable will be watching this one for years to come more than any other. It is a movie that i think lots of young men can relate to.

4.V for Vendetta-I never read the comic that this movie is based off of and i proable never will which is a good thing because most people says the comic is better.  I cant believe that since this is such a damn good movie.

5.Miami Vice-I went into this movie expecting something totally diffrent then what i got.  But what i got was a great movie and after seeing it i wouldnt want this movie any other way.

6.Grizzly Man-In my opinon this is the best documentary of all time.  Timothy Treadwell is one of the craziest people to be put on earth but even when i was watching this i would wish sometimes i would have done what he did.

7.Casino Royale-James Bond rocked in this movie. Im glad they brought the franchise back the way they did.  This is the first Bond movie in awhile that made me excited to see the next one once the credits rolled.

8.Cars-Man i love Pixar.

9.The Break Up-Vince Vaughn proved he could actually do some really serious acting.  I liked the fights and the ending of this movie it felt very real actually.

10.Apocalypto-Its a 2 hour chase scene with a good story.  Mel Gibson can direct a damn good film."

In my time at HHN i have been pissed on, punched, and had been called anything with the word fuck in it.  O also people say i look like steve-o from jackass which is kinda cool.  Anyways if anyone wants tickets call me and i will try and set something up.

Here are my random thoughts:

-I was told i should intern for a congressman, but i dont want to do sexual favors for them unless the congressmans name is Racheal McAdams.

-I'm ready to apply to universities and i know which one i want to go to i just hope i get accepted.

-Doug, Blake and I spend alot of time throwing around more movie ideas and hopefully we can film one of them soon.

-I am ready to go up to FSU and see Mike and Francis the tank.  Hopefully the trip will rock hard.  Who knows maybe i will never leave.

-There is alot of concerts coming to the area. I would really like to see Death Cab or Dashboard Confessional but no one seems to want to go with me.

-My truck will soon be dead. Then i get my motorcycle(I wish).

Man, life is going pretty damn good right now, some things i want to figure out but besides that pretty good.

That is my post for this month.

I'll leave you with something that i enjoyed from The West Wing.

"event","Ok its finally here for me, my turn to pick who i think should really win everything.  Now i will say before i start this that there are 4 movies that are up for oscars that i have not seen.  A History of Violence, Capote, Syriana, and Match Point.  But to be honest im not sure any of those movies can sway who i think should win.

Best Supporting Actress-Sarah Jessica Parker(The Family Stone)
I have to say that this is a weak year for actresses, i really dont feel they were given a oppurtunity to do good movies.  Mrs. Parker did a great job in this film and even though she was nominated for best actress at the golden globes in really is a ansemble movie but she was really great.  The seen around the dinner table where she is talking is by far one of my favorite movie moments of the year.

Best Supporting Actor-Daniel Craig(Munich)
This is even a big suprise to me because his character never really comes full circle.  Yet, for some strange reason when he was on screen he just made things way for interesting and was the best character to me in that whole movie.  I wish i knew what happened to his character instead of Eric Bana'a.  he also made me very excited about how good of a actor he is because he is the next bond.  People say he is dorky, but to me he was the coolest part of the movie.

Best Actress-Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line)
Blondie can actually act!  Man i will tell you what she did great and looked damn good doing it.  She made me feel for her characters situation every bit. Its about time this girl who does great romantic comedies get a damn oscar.

Best Actor-Joaquin Phoenix(Walk the Line)
I couldnt pick anyone else.  From the minute i heard he was going to play Cash i was excitied.  I was nervous about him singing all the songs and not totally looing like Cash.  But he did it, I also would like to state that anytime you saw Jamie Fox singing in a concert in RAY it was actually Ray Charles, but Mr. Phoenix did all his singing in this.  By the end of the film he was Johnny Cash and the badass that he was.  Its a shame that on March 5th he proable wont win but no matter what he will be my winner, capote would get his ass kicked by cash!

Best Director-Peter Jackson(King Kong)
I cant believe he wasnt even nominated.  He made a movie where you care about a damn ape.  I enjoyed it so much more than his previous work and after watching the video diaries and seeing this guy basically loose 100 pounds while filming is crazy. Ang Lee and Speilberg did great too but Peter just blew me away with this and it just goes to show that big budget movies from hollywood can be a beautiful thing.

Best Picture-The Wedding Crashers
My one beef with the oscars is this,WHY THE HELL DOESNT COMDIES GET RESPECT!  Comedies always get looked past but this one had everything.  it was great movie all around.  Brokeback was good, Munich was good, but neither gave me that truly great cinematic experience.  Movies dont always have to be serious, some of my favorites are one's that make you FEEL GOOD! when its all over.

Well there they are.  I would also like to give props to GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, it was also good.  Im not a big fan of CRASH, but all the actors did amazing in it.

Now im off to finish my term paper on a gay poet."

"event","Ok i know alot of you are not big mrs. davis fans and maybe im only hearing half the story but i would like to say i am very disapointed with the theater.  Mike brought it up earlier on a post and i have heard some more about it.  I cant beleive they are basically leaving her on her ass in the middle of the street.  Most the people on the board of advisors went to rst and drama camp and now they want to basically destroy it.  It reminds me of any movie where a person starts a company and then the board of advisors they hire end of being the people who back stab them.

She had a old school style of teaching and even though i joke about her i think she has taught me more in acting then anyone else(the second closets is her daughter).  I am now boycotting that damn theater until they allow her back, it wont be hard seeing is how i dont ever go there because there adult shit they call shows sucks.  

This one is for davis!

God Bless America and God Bless Mrs. Davis!

"event","Hey everybody i havent really updated in awhile so i thought i would.  School and the apartment are really fun and exciting.  I cant beleive how cool it is to have only a 50 minute class 3 days a week.  I think for me the real reason i like this so much is because i have alot of freedom, i mean i have had a curfew of 11 oclock for along time and now being able to stay out even later is great.  So i have ok roomates except for one flaw but i mean they both like movies but then again who doesnt like movies? . 

So if you remember last summer i interned for tis guys making a documentary about NASA well he also was making a independent movies also.  The movie was pretty damn bad but today it opens in 109 theaters nationwide.  Three of those theater are searstown, waterford and oveido.  Im going to see it tonight because i think its pretty damn awesome that he got it into so many theaters and even though the movie blew he still continued to get it out to where audiences can see it.  I like that determination and when i make films i hope to work as hard as he does for this bad one.  So if anyone wants to support a struggling filmaker who made a bad movie but its only bad because of the story visually its beautiful then go see ECHOES OF INNOCENCE.

Damn i talked more about a movie that wasnt good then i did about my own life.  O but i will say this im going to try out for a film classes projects which doug banks is in and even though i wont get to work with my favorite director most likely im still hoping i get to do a scene from like Jerry Maguireor or Sideways but i dont care itll be fun. ""Where is she Finch?""

So the Johnny Cash movie is coming out so in honor of that......
GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS JOHNNY CASH!

Open minded and accepting, you strive for harmony in your important relationships.
It takes a long time for people to get to know you. You are hesitant to let people get close.
But once you care for someone, you do everything you can to help them grow and develop.

"event","THOMAS A. EDISON: 
Restlessness and discontent are the first necessities of progress.

ISAAC ROSENFELD: 
In every dispute between parent and child, both cannot be right, but they may be, and usually are, both wrong. It is this situation which gives family life its peculiar hysterical charm.

ANN LANDERS: 
If you have love in your life it can make up for a great many things you lack. If you don't have it, no matter what else there is, it's not enough.

BUDDHA: 
Believe nothing just because a so-called wise person said it. Believe nothing just because a belief is generally held. Believe nothing just because it is said in ancient books. Believe nothing just because it is said to be of divine origin. Believe nothing just because someone else believes it. Believe only what you yourself test and judge to be true.

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: 
I think we all have a little voice inside us that will guide us. It may be God, I don't know. But I think that if we shut out all the noise and clutter from our lives and listen to that voice, it will tell us the right thing to do.
YOU SAY IT SUPERMAN!

CHINESE PROVERB: 
One moment of patience may ward off great disaster. One moment of impatience may ruin a whole life
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: 
Keep your fears to yourself, but share your inspiration with others"

"event","My ear is really starting to hurt.  There is a long story for why its hurting in the first place but now its getting bad.  During the school day it itched and then for like the last 4 hours its been pounding with pain but im not worried im sure it will not hurt after i go deaf in one ear.  

Im actually started to get pumped to finish TWO DAYS after watching its trailer which makes my house look scary as hell.  O and speaking of movies that cowboy movie that richter and paul were making is still being made, wont they realize that no one else actually wants to do that movie except for them but hey at least i have a cool cowboy outfit.  Finally in movie news i had a movie that i was thinking about filming except i realized how incredible boring it would be.  It bascially would be ""Rememberance"" with running.

Damn it seems like college is coming so fast.  Then after college i actually have to grow up and be mature about things.  Which means when someone says the word ""balls"" i cant laugh out loud without being stared at by other mature people in this world.

"event","Well since the oscars are tonight i decided i would have the JON AWARDS in which i pick my favorites from this year.

Best Supporting Actress: Natile Portman(Garden State)
Most people would say her best work was in Closer but i think this was maybe the best acting of her career.

Best Supporting Actor: David Caradine(Kill Bill Vol.2)
I cant believe this guy was overlooked.  He made a character we should have hated because of how evil he was into someone we actually liked.

Best Actress:Hillary Swank(Million Dollar Baby)
In my mind there should be no way anyone else should be allowed to win this award except her.

Best Actor:Tom Cruise(Collateral)
Even though Jamie Foxx is getting all the appreciation it is actually his co star in Collateral that i believe did the best male acting this year.  I just dont get why Tom was overlooked by every award ceremony.

Best Director:Clint Eastwood(Million Dollar Baby)
This man certainly knows how to mess with your emotions during a movie.  He also is great with lighting(i havent seen a movie of his with bad lighting).

Best Picture:Million Dollar Baby
I dont just think it is the best picture of the year but one of the best films i have ever seen.  Sideways had a terrific group of actors together but i feel this had the best cast and i wish more movies had acting as good as this in it.  Its a bummer that The Aviator will when best picture tonight(i havent seen it)but i just dont think Aviator could come close to this movie in the emotions it makes you feel.



Thats all i have to say about that.

God Bless America and God Bless Johnny Cash!

"event","I cant believe I rear-ended someone today. Now, given she did pull out in front of me, but i still feel lame because if I paid better attention it wouldn't have happened. Not only that, but I didn't get her info and I needed to. But I think I was just so nervous that I would get a ticket that I kept my mouth closed. There wasn't much damage and my truck is fine. I've done two things in the past two days that I'm not proud of. One was the accident, the other was quiting Chapter Two. I have to say I dont like being a quitter, but for some weird reason I didn't expect it to be so much work. However I'm glad i have more free time so we can make some freaking movies.  You know what i care about hings way to much and i hate it i mean why cant i just block things out of my mind but i nver will and i hate myself for it.
Anyways, I want to say how Valentines Day this year was really special to me. I have never felt this way about anyone in all my life. Just thinking about her now makes me want to see her. Well I'm going to stop being all lovey dovey.

God Bless America and God Bless Johnny Cash!

"event","You know i cant believe a group of kids would actually try to model themselves after doug, blake, mike and me.  I mean according to my sister they have even decided which one of us each one of them is.
Ryan-Me
Doug-Mike
Luke-Blake
Jarrod-Doug
There is no way they are actually trying to be us i mean thats just stupid.  Im proable one of the worst role models you could have but hey i guess i can also kind of take it as a complicated.

So today was most likely my last RST show unless Jessica or all my friends suddenly decide to try out for the next one because the onl reason i would truly do it would be to hang out.  You know whats weird is that ive done RST for 8 years and i didnt feel that bad leaving it.  I mean im just didnt get sad or anything i was reflective more than anything.  There have been so great memories there.  In movies if a man cries usual something changes in his life somehow.  Now it was early May was the last time i cried and before that i hadnt cried in a year and a half.  Thinking back now when i cried in May i did change and i think in a good way.  Well im obviously starting to talk out of my ass so ill stop being so whack.
Until next time.....

ATTENTION EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE ""TWO DAYS""! </big> </b>

Doug is in talks with Regal Cinema to host the world premiere of ""Two Days."" It will be at the Searstown Theater in 2-3 weeks.
<u><b> We need to know how many people will be there if it's going to be on the big screen.</b></u> 
We're kinda screwed because we can't book it until we know how many will show up, and we won't know how many will show up until we book it. So please, if you plan on seeing it, please, please, please, let Jon, Blake, or Doug know. Just leave a comment. Thank you. We'll have an exact release date soon. 
It's all up to you now. 
Hope to see you there!</center>"

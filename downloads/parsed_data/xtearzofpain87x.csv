"event","""God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve (or Eve and Shirley).""

That is entirely true. God also neglected to create Cain or Abel (Adam and Eve did that bit), prosthetics, eyeglasses, cartoons, in vitro fertilization, wall-to-wall carpeting, stereo systems, computers, biology (did you know that according to the Bible a bat is a bird, you think with your heart, and your feelings come from your kidneys?), vaccines, paper, radios, cars, playground equipment, oxygen tanks, writing implements, CDs, seedless grapes, organ transplants, the English language, vacuum cleaners, electric fans, air conditioning, central heating, surgical tools, telephones, antibiotics, satellites, trains, deodorant, soap, guitars, insulin injections for diabetics, bottled water, bicycles, scissors, rayon, pianos, psychotropic drugs, prisons, hospitals, television, contact lenses, airplanes... shall I continue?


""Marriage is meant to create children.""

Is it? What if one spouse is infertile? Are infertile people forbidden to marry? Why isn't sterilization (vasectomies or tubal ligations) illegal? Are condoms sinful? What about birth control pills? Shouldn't all those condom-using, birth control pill-popping people be hunted down and forced to repent? What happens when you become too old to reproduce? What about those people who get married but don't want children? Does adoption count, or is that ""cheating""? What happens to people who have kids but aren't married? Do they explode?


""The Bible forbids homosexuality.""

You mean here, right?
Leviticus 18:22-
Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

Looks to me like you're right. Anyone have any Canadian or Mexican slaves for sale? I could use some help in my fields.
Leviticus 25:44-
As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.

And make sure you inquire whether or not a woman is on the rag before you touch her. You have a right to know if you're going to be unclean for the rest of the day.
Leviticus 15:19-
When a woman has a discharge, and the discharge in her body is blood, she shall be in her menstrual impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.


""You can't love someone of the same gender.""

Girls, tell that to your mothers, aunts, and sisters. Boys, tell that to your fathers, uncles, and brothers. And everyone- can you honestly say you don't love your closest friends? You can? Do they know that? Oh, now you're out of friends, huh? Hm. I wonder why.


""It's not natural.""

If animals don't do it, neither should we, is that it? Well. Last I checked, animals didn't use silverware or electricity either. Nor do they cook or season their food, or keep other species in little boxes for members of their own species to come gawk at. They also occasionally eat their offspring. Oh, that's not what you meant? Well then, visit and read the article at http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm . Then come back and talk to me about ""natural"".


""Not marriage, why aren't civil unions enough?""

You subscribe to the ""separate but equal"" doctrine? I don't suppose you recall that ""separate but equal"" was judged to be anything but, and was unconstitutional to boot, do you? Racism is different from homophobia? No, it really isn't. They're both ridiculous forms of discrimination. You're not a homophobe, how dare I equate you with a racist? Well, if you're not afraid of homosexuals, you hate them for no reason. How does that make you any better than a racist? You say I'm twisting it? How?


""It's perverted and disgusting.""

I think tomatoes are disgusting. The thought of eating one makes me want to throw up. I'm not going to dislike someone or want them to have fewer rights than me just because they eat a fruit I consider utterly nasty. No one is forcing me to eat tomatoes. Granted, I see other people eating them all the time. But I'm quite mature enough for their tomato-eating not to be relevant in my life. Their nutritional orientation is none of my business.


""Marriage is a religious institution.""

Tell that to the happily wedded atheists and to the justices of the peace who performed the ceremonies. Try to call their kids bastards and see if you don't lose a few teeth. Didn't you ever hear of the wall of separation between church and state? Marriage is a LEGAL institution. It grants people LEGAL benefits along the lines of tax breaks, inheriting without major taxes or probate, and custody of children. It is entirely possible (and often done!) to have a wedding completely bereft of clergy. You were saying?


""I don't believe in it.""

Then marry someone of the opposite gender. No gay person will push his or her beliefs on you by trying to stop you. Oh, that's not what you meant? What did you mean, pray tell?


""Homosexuality is a choice.""

So, when and how did you decide that you were straight? What do you mean you didn't choose it? Isn't sexuality a choice? How do you know you wouldn't prefer to be gay if you just had a good gay lover? Maybe your parents brainwashed you into heterosexuality and you need to be sent to an ""ex-straight"" camp. I'll get right to work on that.


""Marriage is sacred.""

Why hasn't anyone excommunicated Britney Spears (55-hour marriage) and Elizabeth Taylor (married six or seven times) yet?


""I don't want to think about two guys/two girls in bed.""

So don't. No one will force you. Why are straight people so bloody obsessed with sex? Is your marriage all about sex? You never have a nice loving cuddle or a romantic dinner? You never have a nice family Christmas morning, or a Passover seder? Oh, PS to the frightened heteros- NOT ALL GAY OR BI PEOPLE WANT TO FUCK YOU. How conceited is that? Do you want to jump into bed with every member of the opposite sex that you see? Be secure in your ugliness and/or stupidity. If ""People who are gay and of my gender will automatically want to have sex with me!"" is lurking anywhere in what manages to pass for your brain, I can make you this promise: No gay person in his or her right mind wants anything to do with someone as retarded as you."

"event","This is what I don't understand. Some ppl sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean types, the kind of types who berate them and belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made. Ppl complain that they never meet nice girls, girls who are genuinely interested and compelling, who are intelligent and sweet and smart and beautiful; they despair that no good women want to share in their lives, that girls play mindgames, that girls love to keep them hanging. Yet,  I ask you: were you to meet one of these genuinely interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number and wait for her to call... and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend/girlfriend, would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the ""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth? And would you, or would you not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? Because therein lies the truth, guys: us nice girls are everywhere. But you're not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intermural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm grade, or that argument you keep having with your father; you're looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom you were using during it. >So don't say you're on the lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you take. Sometimes we go undercover; sometimes we go in disguise: sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight miniskirt won't answer your catcalls, sometimes you're looking at a nice girl in whore's clothing - - we might say we like the attention, we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends, but we're all thinking the same thing: ""This isn't me. Tomorrow morning, I'll be wearing a teeshirt and flannel shorts, I'll have slept alone and I'll be making my hungover best friend breakfast. See through the disguise. See me."" You never do. Why? Because you only see the exterior, you only see the slutty girl who welcomes those advances. You don't want the nice girl.. so don't say you're looking for a relationship: relationships take time and energy and intent, three things we're willing to extend - - but in return, we're looking for compassion and loyalty and trust, three things you never seem willing to express. Maybe nice guys/girls finish last, but in the race they're running they're chasing after the whores and the sluts and the easy-targets... the nice girls are waiting at the finish line with water and towels and a congradulatory hug (and yes, if she's a nice girl and she likes you, the sweatiness probably won't matter), hoping against hope that maybe you'll realize that they're the ones that you want at the end of that silly race............"

Step one you say we need to talk
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life"

21 Reasons Why I Love Her

I can be myself when I am with you. 
Your idea of romance is dimlights, softmusic, and just the two of us. 
Because you make me feel like,like, like I have never felt before. 
I can tell you anything, and you won't be shocked. 
Your undying faith is what keeps the flame out of love alive  
You and me together, we can make magic. 
We're a perfect match. 
Thinking of you, fills me with a wonderful feeling. 
Your love gives me the feeling, that the best is still ahead. 
You never give up on me, and that's what keeps me going. 
You are simply irresistible

  
 I love you because you bring the best out of me. 
Your terrific sense of humor 
Everytime I look at you, my heart misses a beat 
You're the one who holds the key to my heart 
You always say what I need to hear (You are perfect). 
You have taught me the true meaning of love. 
Love is, what you mean to me - and you mean everything. 
You are my theme for a dream. 
I have had the time of my life and I owe it all to you. 
When I look into your eyes, I can see your heart. 
Your love for me is a natural anti-depressant. 
I love to hear your voice. 
               

Your love has helped me to rediscover myself. 
Your love is an effective anti-dote to despair. 
I love to wake up with you by my side...It makes my days better. 
You always make me feel that you are by my side no matter what. 
I love that feeling of being secure when you wrap your arms around me. 
I love the way you keep your cool when I do something stupid. 
Just being with you feels like I can defy the whole world. 
You mean the world to me. 
I like your small gestures that speak volumes about how much you care. 
I love the way you treasure the gifts that I gave you. 
 

I love the way you patch up with me after a tumultuous fight. 
And, of-course, your intelligence, 'cause you were smart enough to fall in love with me ;-)"

JOHN IS A SHVJDCVDJ

Kay...Today...Hannah and I were singing, ""John's a homosexual"" and Mariah joined in.

So he got mad and he was attacking us.

Eventually.

The fucktard wraps his arm around my neck, pulls me to the ground.

AND HE BEATS ME WITH A ROCK!

HE FUCKING WHACKED ME WITH A ROCK REPEATIVLY!

Everyone was yelling at him and kicking him to get him off, I swear that boy has mental issues....


Given the fact this is public...If any people who are not heteros read this please don't take offense. He just doesn't like being called that. I don't mind homosexuals lol So if that offended you please. I am not trying to make you feel uncomfortable (:"

"event","There is a orange cat that has attached itself to our house.

He now has attached himself to me...

He seems to despise my Grandma....

He likes it when I pet him and seems to have an obsession with the curves of my body. He constantly rubs his face against my chest, rear, and thighs. If I try to leave him, I have to beg him because if I don't beg he doesn't let me go and bites me.

If I open the front door he is waiting for me outside.

When he sees me he runs towards me and jumps up like a poodle trying to attack my hand with his skull.

Funny...Cats don't usually like me...Must be the turkey and milk...

I named him Kyounkichi."

"event","Today was so fucking fun!

First Nina, Megan, and I ditched Hannah and went mud sleding. It was so fucking fun and Megan hit a tree lmfao I so cleverly recorded it on her camera. Afterwards Megan had to go TT.TT How dreadfully sad. Nina and I went to the pool with Nick. Nina and I were recording ourselves being jackasses and jumping into the unheated icecube pool. We were screaming and Nick was snickering. 

Second...HAPPY FUN HOTTUB TIME! Nina, Nick, and I all had fun in the hot tub. I sat on Nick's lap and made Mr.Shnargleblib kiss him, Mr.Shnargleblib is my hand puppet. He was drawn with a green Sharpie and has evil eyes and pointy fangs. So I was sitting on Nick's lap and Nina said I was a belly warmer. Nick said I was his extra warmth xD After being in the hot tub, Nick gave me a piggy back ride as we jumped into the Icecube Water, Kristina whom had already been in there was cracking up. Then Nick yelled and climbed out of the water with me still on his back but Nina grabbed my shirt and pulled us back in. We ran out and I slipped on some water and fucked up my leg, of course...Me being the noble person I am I simply put on my BRAVE FACE and beared the pain! Lmfao

LAST! We went back to Nina's and watched DADDY DAYCARE! We wanted to watch Eurotrip but we couldn't find it TT.TT So we watched DADDY DAYCARE and watched as the fat man kept getting hurt and singing about how he was a fat man. ""One day my mama told me! I'll be a man someday! I'm gonna be a stronnnnnng man! I'm a biiiiiiig man! I'm a fat man!"" LMFAO Then Nina left to go talk with her MAMA and Nick said something about the FATMAN and I cracked up resulting with my face in his chest laughing. Then he put his arm around me xD 


QUOTE OF THE DAY: ""OW! I hit the fucking tree!""-Megan

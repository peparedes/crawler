Do you fucking hear me?

I love you. I don't know what loving anyone means anymore but I love you and I'll never know what it means except for how I feel for you.

tell you a secret.

i have no idea 
what the last 
8 years of my life 
have been about.

and i am sitting 
on my couch
after just getting home
from work
watching my roommate
eat green beans.

i want to be a country singer
or a tap dancer in a band.

but really all i want
is for something i care about
to make a damn bit of sense.

(my roommate eating green beans
makes perfect sense
so i guess i finally got what i wanted.)"

i tried to curl up on your side of the bed, tried to produce the kind of heat you always found next to me [somehow the temperature on your side was always warmer, you'd wake up devoid of blankets], but even with the weight of my body, your side remained cold. i rolled into the middle, and the frigid sheets reminded me that this was it. that this was what was left.

i'd put away pictures of you the moment that you'd taken yourself away from me. my closet now hides the evidence, hides the sweatshirts i'd stolen, hides the gifts you'd given to fill your place next to me as i slept a million miles from where you were.

i wrap myself in blankets and go hunting now. just one look before bed. just one deep inhale of whatever smell i've tricked myself into thinking was yours. just one squeeze of something tangible.

i miss you so much. 

how is it that you love me still, and yet our ghost is haunting no one but myself?"

"event","hey guys. i'm currently taking an installation class at school and our next project is being received by the morris musuem of art here in augusta.

i need YOUR HELP for my next piece.

it revolves around post mail.

anyone who is interested in helping only needs to send interesting mail to me at:

tena marie aceto
2156 ellis street
augusta, ga 30904

i'd prefer to have it sent in postcard format. and the more homemade the better. if it is an envelope, it won't be opened, so feel free to tell me you hate me. i'll never know.

and you know, you're welcome to send me real letters too. that would actually be pretty awesome.

i know a lot of you are busy with school/work/life, but i'd really like all the help i can get.

thanks in advance.
tena marie"

"event","So I am making  my first few offical payments on my student loans tonight, yay!
I hated my job, but I was good at it, and I hate being out of work more.

So I need to find some two bit crap happy job until I finally get a teaching job.  I should have majored in an academic.  I would already have ajob.

So we are driving Ana home today, and I am not looking forward to ten hours in Josh's Van, but at the same time I am.  I am so burned out from this week, in a good way, but I have not been able to get myself enough sleep.  I will miss ana when she goes. *pouts* It was fun having her here.  

I had the worst chinese food ever last night.  Happy Garden Sucks, and my childhood friend needs new taste buds.  But Pocky is love...and so is wall flower, such a good manga...

Anime gluttoning all week has me in crazed otaku mode...Yay!!  I will be working on art next week and getting more resumes  and applications out to the  world. I just have to keep busy. 

The graduation party was fabulous...everyone  enjoyed themselves, there were a few no shows but all with  good reasons...I still have wine coolers left over though...the good ones...mmmmm...Bartlesand James.  Go Dad.

Blabbering on...this probably makes little sense, seeing as I have not slept in forty eight hours. I need to get to sleep so I am not coma nikk on the road trip tomorrow.  

*poofs*"

"event","So I have tomorrow off, and friday and saturday.  More hours a bit at a time.  I am sending some more job stuff out tomorrow, which is actually today...I love 3 am.  

So here is the deal, I am taking driving lessons soon.  I guess since I haven't driven in over a year that this is appropriate.  The only thing that really sucks is that I have no clue when I am going to be able to afford a car. 

Hopefully the people with the jobs call soon...everyone has hired in the past five years, and have no retiring art teachers...so now I am working on more artwork...if I have to go to grad school for my MFA instead of My MAE so be it, I will teach college.

Mmmmm...music.  Well little by little I am getting that mix stuff done.  tonight is the last night I devote to this.  I will be done, yay!

have to call the ana, I hung out with the zac recently, just before edinboro's spring break.  I have yet to get a visit in on the old crew...*sobs*  Working on it...

Went to a party at my best friends house this past saturday.  Ended up spending the night, there must have been ten of us in one room.  Everyone got trashed...damn jeremiah and his good mixed drinks.  Oh well...I got to witness some of the most disturbingly funny antics yet.  What you can do to intoxicated people with a highlighter is hysterical...especially when the black light is burning."

"event","So how about not sleeping...Hip Hip Hooray for all the non-sleepers out there.  I have come to the conclusion that sleep is an unneccessary evil, (I know I spelled that wrong, but I am not moving from my spot right now to get the freaking dictionary).  I mean, I could get so much done if my body didn't need sleep.

For crying out loud, this inspiration thing is getting out of hand.  I have decided that my sculpture that I am currently working on needs wings.  Now how to build them...guess I shouldn't complain, since it is going to be KICK BUM!!!  

Yes I gave up swearing for lent and it is about time I hold to it before I damn myself further into the pits of hell...Sorry almighty freaking creator...not that I am the strictest christian out there...FAR from, I am sure the pope would have me excommunicated if he even had a clue...

I need more extra fine sharpies...for those who don't know my obsessive perfectionist vices...regular sharpies don't write as pretty on cd's that I burn...I get very cranky if my handwriting does not look just so...I have been known to rewrite my notes from class because they weren't pretty enough...*Hail the art majors*  

So I am on CD 12, that is just alternative rock mind you...I still have rap, although that is rather limited in my collection, country (even more limited), stuff I tend to sing along to...mmmmm..., pop, and r and b.  Yes I own some, and yes I will dance in my I see dead people shirt and bondage skirt to it in my room on occasion....Hello run on sentences."

"event","So I finally got some leads via Monster.com that do not involve sales, or some other task totally irrelevant to teaching...

Sitting here thinking about thunderstorms...I would love for it to be raining cats and dogs...just to stand in the middle of the rain and just let go, close my eyes, and just feel the water course over me.  Smelling the smells...that spring smell of fresh earth that lingers somewhere between intoxicating and unpleasant.  

Caught up with an old friend on Friday night, and now I am getting through my mad notion of mixing every cd I have together by category on the computer and burning these to disk.  A vain attempt to lessen the wear and tear on my cd collection...music is the nectar of the gods..."

"event","So I am finally registered on Monster.com...yay...and guess what, art teaching jobs, aren't as numerous as I had hoped.

Oh, well, guess that means that I will just have to get more intense.

I had a date on Saturday...it went really well.  Sweet guy, extremely intelligent, ambitious...and he survived my family on the first date.  *grins to all who know my family*

I am working on some art stuff at the moment, that when I finally finish will allow me to embark on a slide taking frenzy.  Then I can update a deviant art account so as to get some of my stuff online. 

Last night, I was laying in bed praying for sleep...the blanket was pulled up over my face and I was looking through it to the ceiling.  So I start thinking about morgues and if this is what it would be like to be in one, because they are refrigerated and my room is freaking cold...that is what I get I suppose...living in the basement.

Bouncing randomly to another subject...I want to make my relief of angelic crucifixion into a table, and I lack the supplies and equipment to do so...frustrating when you get an ah-ha moment and are thwarted.  

well, more work to do...out for now..."

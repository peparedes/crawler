It has a life cycle of 500 to 600 years and after that amount of time, it sets itself on fire and dies in the flames. Then, after three days, it rises again from the ashes. It is a completely benign creature who lives in dew. It is said that the phoenix has a beautiful melodious song which grows ever more mournful as its life comes to an end. It is also a symbol of the sun and immortality. <br>

I can't see why people get up and go to work for some asshole who yells at them all the time. There's no point. People just quit while You're a head, or give head and get promoted. Whatever. I think that corner of mine is calling to me. I shall go shake now!!"

anyhue- i hate preps 
there was something exciting that happen in my neighbor hood!!
cops were looking for a blue truck and were cruzin down the road and then we looked out the window this cop was across the street and he was all skilled he layed down a spike strip and got behind his car and pulled out his gun we didn't any thing for like 2 minutes then we heard cars and the blue truck sped by going at least a hundred, he hit the spike strips and kept on going with no tires, i guess i friend of my parents jumped out in front of him and finally 2 miles from my house his truck caught on fire. i am so excited because stuff like that doesn't happen here. it's complete dullsville!!! so that was great."

Never argue with me. I'll drag you down to my level and beat you with a fuckin bat!
 Thank you and Good Night."

"event","I love you Gin in juice. Every one eat cookies and Lollipops. Aka Drink Mudslides and Wild berry Wine coolers. The best Think Ever is Jack Daniel's whiskey. This is one of the best songs ever: Why Won't You Die on the movie, The Queen Of The Damned;

You fell a-way 
What more can I say
The feelings evolved
I won't let it out
I can't re-place
Your screaming face
Feeling the sickness inside

Why won't you die?
Your Blood in mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine

So many words
Can't describe my face
This feelings evolved
So soon to break out
I can't relate
To a happy state
Feeling the blood running side

Why won't you die?
Your Blood in mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine

Why is everything so fuckin hard for me
Keep me down to what you seek I still beg
Must you tell me and provoke the ministrate
Keep on trying I'm not tight so weasel it

Why is everything so fuckin hard for me
Why is everything so fuckin hard for me

Why won't you die?
Your Blood in mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine

Why won't you die?
Your Blood in mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine"

I understand why people kill themselves. I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could, I wish I had it in me. Unfortunately this world is nowhere as grim as the next would be. But I'd love to be the reason you couldn't sleep at night. Maybe then you'd understand what it feels like to be consumed by a plague. <strong>You've</strong> ruined everything.<br /><br /><br /><br /></span></div>"

You don't know the first thing about me. You're nothing like me, you can't comprehend the truth.&nbsp; You can't comprehend the idea of family coming first over all things. You were sucker punched and you've lost you're ability to see things for what they really are. If there's one thing I've learned, never take things at face value. There is always more to the story, there is always a past we're still waste deep in. Regardless if we're running from it, running to it or lying idle. 

It really is amusing my friend, seeing you, caught up in your own ignorance, tangled in a web of lies. I'm sure in the end you may experience a fraction of what I've had to live with for a longer time then you could even stand. You think this is the roots of hate and&nbsp; jealousy? Or envy? I don't waste my time with that petty shit. It's not my job to convince anyone, its not my job to make you believe. This isn't a game to me, this is my life and you're playing with fire."

"event","It blows my mind how people take love for granted. The comfort, the passion, the excitement, the feeling that there is that one person who will always be there for you. I feel like my love hasn't ever been good enough, like I'm never good enough. I gave myself away completely and now I'm stuck feeling incomplete. The best feeling in the world is having the love you give, recognized, and returned. Love can take you anywhere, get you through anything and you'd never feel like you've wasted a second of your life. No regrets. Her eyes take me away.<br /><br />To me, the worst feeling in the world, is not only having that love held back and kept away from you, but given to someone else who doesn't deserve it. Someone else who lied and manipulated and cheated his way into your lovers heart. It tears me apart from the inside out how she can't see through it. <br /><br />I feel like I'm stuck out in the cold, screaming in the dark thinking to myself&nbsp; &quot;I know shes lost again.&quot; All I want to do is be the one who loves her, who tells her every things fine, cuz I have you.

I guess that would be cheating, and would probably leave little room for faith to play a part in my life.<br /><br />On the other hand, I've met some really awesome people down here, and it makes things a lot easier (with or without furniture.)

"event","Ive been hurt once again. I sit here alone in my mind wondering how this could get any worse. When you love someone so much that leaving them to absolve you of any pain caused directly by them would seem better, in actuality, selfish on both hands.

I guess this is one of my first times actually wondering if I was better off. It just blows my mind how inconsiderate she can be. How hurtful she can be, but yet I've never felt more loved in my life by another person. I never really thought I'd be a victim of inconsideration to this extent, in a relationship with her. To feel so left out, forgotten about, unwanted. Maybe I'm just too dry for her. Too boring, too un-fulfilling. I would certainly hope that I'snt the case.

How exclusive is our relationship? I can't even answer that. I know what I want it to be, but im lacking the mutual feeling. When experience surpasses all of this, and things are too good to be true...Then you hit little bump that leads to a fork in the road, and say to yourself ""This is such a little issue compare to all the other shit we've been through, how can this be this way?""

A million and one questions answered with excuses and infidelity. Such opposition. Its beyond me, it really is. I wish that this was just a little easier. I wish that this didn't hurt me so much. I wish I wasnt viewed as the opinionated one. Ive tried, and oddly enough I'm still trying. You really think I'm one to just say ""I fold!"" Eat me. I have a dad, hes worse.

I guess I'm second guessing myself. Will the things I strive for be reached? Ever? You could have asked me this question months ago, I could answer it. 

I just want this feeling of insentience to pass so I can put love back in its place, where it should be. Where it was.

Oh yeah, welcome back jack ;)"

Seriously, I must have walked a total of 10 miles today. Maybe more. I guess when its hot outside it feels like you are actually walking longer than you are.

* Things I liked about today *

- I got to se my girlfriend throughout the whole day numerous times. (so awesome, shes amazing by the way)

- I hung out with my family at a bbq and got to dance lebanese style =)

- I hung out with pat and dave (like every day)

- I got a lot of exercise from all the walking i did today

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  

* Things I didn't like about today *

- Meeting this new friend of patrick's, who is really weird and creepy.

- Melody forgot my birthday

- Some dude put Melody's hand really really rediculously close to his wang. (I didn't think that was necessary at all for wrapping a bandage. I regret not saying anything about it. I wanted to say something like....""Hey, gettin' a little close there with my girlfriends hand, aye?""

- Walking so much

- How hot it was


Now, I am off to sleep I think. I'm actually quite awake, but no one is around to keep me entertained for the moment. Maybe I'll go for a walk. Not.<br>

I woke up this morning and Melody picked me up and we went to maitland park and had a huge picnic with some church people, and there were these little kids and basketballs and more little kids and rocket ship thing. it was greeat. then we went to her dads house and ate food and had a birthday party and stuff. good times. 

so i think i should quit smoking. (if i want to get married of course :P) but seriously.... i think i need to stop. i wonder if i can quit.... it would be nice if i could, so then i can rejoin all the cool kids in society, lol. everyone says the first week is the hardest, i guess ill give that a try right now. so starting now, i think im gonna quit. weeeeeeeeee.

now watch, as soon as i quit smoking, ill end up picking up another bad habitt. hahaha, just kidding niggaz. 

here are some picture from my birthday bash extravaganza....

Do more research on Christianity and possibly consider being baptized and accepting Jesus, if you aren't already Christian.

Christianity is the second of the Abrahamic faiths; it follows Judaism and is followed by Islam. It differs in its belief of Jesus, as not a prophet nor historical figure, but as God in human form. The Holy Trinity is the concept that God takes three forms: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Ghost (sometimes called Holy Spirit). Jesus taught the idea of instead of seeking revenge, one should love his or her neighbors and enemies. Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross to save humankind and forgive people's sins.

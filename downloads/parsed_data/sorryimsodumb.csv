Friday I went to school and I thought I wasgonna go home then Rose was gonna come pick me up, but when I got to 3rd she was there so I called my mom and after school I went to Rosa Brito's house.  This girl, Jamie Bennet, and this guy, Stephen, went with us.  Well we, Stephen, Rosa, and me, dropped Jamie off at her house then went to Rosa's.  Rosa changed then we all went to Jamie's and there was 50 kids well there was really like 10!!  So we stayed there and helped with the kids, died Stephen's hair, my mom brought my clothes, then we left!!  First we had to go get MiMi from Adam McFall's house and my friend Denver was the one driving!!  So we went and got her and we went to the store and got 2 12 packs of budlight and a 12 pack of Smirnoff tribleblack and went to the party at Jasons well we sat out said soo long then they got there and I was on like my 10th beer lol.

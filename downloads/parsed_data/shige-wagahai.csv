"event","This is just to work out some of Shige's kinks for my memory and possibly for those who are new or not familiar with Shige. Well, that's only if you care to read about it. However, if you never plan on your muse going anywhere near Shige, then feel free to ignore! :D<br /><b><u></u></b><div class=""ljcut"" text=""The shitz in here, yo~""><b><u><br />History</u></b><br />Shige's the dorm head for Dorm 3, ya know, the ghostie dorm. He shall deny ANY allegations of there being a GHOST inhabiting his building. Not only does it think it's silly, but he doesn't want to admit that he's scared of ghosts. Maybe until ghosts sneaks one on his ass will he believe in it. Shige studies a lot because he's not naturally smart and needs to shove info into that head of his cause he doesn't wanna be a dumbass like he inwardly believes the rest of the school to be. However, while Shige is too busy getting information crammed into his brain, he ain't getting nothing crammed into his ass or cramming someone else's ass. Haha, but no, Shige's fine in that department, however there's only so much a young teenage boy can do about avoiding those natural hormonal instincts. But yeah, even Shige's been able to see a vagina, and it wasn't for biology class.<br />One of Shige's main priorities has been to do well and make his parents proud of him. Shige and his folks have a good relationship so Shige's striving to do well as a way of showing gratitude in a way. However, his grandparents are the pain in Shige's ass. They're all up for upholding the Kato name and is leaving it up to their only grandson.<br />Much to Shige's awesome dismay, his grandparents were eager to continue their family line so they brought it up to themselves to get Shige in an arranged marriage. Lucky for them it was arranged with the girl who Kusano had a false alarm pregnancy with, so at least they found someone who seems to be easy to impregnate. Remember kids: pull out if ya ain't got no rubber.<br />Amidst Shige's attempt to be less of an anal dork (and not in the cool way), his curiosity brought him to form a pretty cute relationship with 2nd year, Ohkura Tadayoshi. They took it pretty slow, not rushing into things so their bedsheets are pretty clean. However, before the winter break, Shige's only been able to tell Ohkura of his grandparents' plan for his future, but Shige had no plan of his own.<br /><br /><br /><b><u>Winter Break</u></b><br />Shige spilled the beans, yo. Aside from the fact that arranged marriages are for hopeless peoples, Shige didn't want to be stuck with the girl that he knows his roommate has fucked. (He still tries to ignore the fact that he had a threesome with Kusano and Koyama anyway) But more importantly, Shige's feeling more strongly committed to Ohkura. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; what he wants. And yeah, Shige told them about his decision on treading on the big gay wave that's inevitable in an all boy's school. His parents and grandparents wasn't really able to catch on the same wave and decided to knock Shige off by kicking him out of their homes. Shige was fine with leaving. He wished his parents luck on producing another son since his dad's allergic to Viagra.<br />Well, Shige still manages to have his connections. He got back to Osaka and contacted one of his older senpai whom he was able to crash with and even managed to help him. Since Shige looks like a damn old man, his senpai got him a fake ID and got him to work at the bar that his senpai operates. (For the fuck of it, I'm calling&nbsp; Shige's senpai Takeru) So, Shige's been able to make some bucks there to help support his tuition for high school and hopefully for when he gets into university. Shige knows it's a no-no to work, but he gets out late at night and works overtime on the weekends by getting around the eyes of the administration. Who would suspect the social-failure, goody-two-shoes that Shige is~?<br /><br /><u><b>Return</b></u><br />He pretty much kept to himself when he returned to school. Sure, he got a massive head cold from sorta overworking as much as he could before going back to school, He hadn't even managed to see much of his own roommate sometimes, forget about trying to seeing his friends and acquaintances again aside from the usual classes. Shige had also been afraid to confront Ohkura about his ordeals of telling hsi family the truth, afraid that Ohkura might feel guilty or even disagree with what he was currently doing. Shige feared that Ohkura might have possibly forgotten about him during the break. There's still a lot that Shige wants to do in the school before he leaves. But he also needs to think about his future.</div><br /><br />Here's some contact info, yo, if you haven't checked out the post in the OOC comm.<br /><b>Name</b>: Alkoi<br /><b>MSN</b>: schwarzkitsune@hotmail.com [This is my primary form of contact.

WAIT, of course not! I'm straight! I shouldn't even be wondering how I would fair in a position like that. And by position... I mean role.

It was nice seeing them again but... I wish they wouldn't bug me about... girlfriends.&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't bring girls home anymore like I used to.&nbsp;Then they keep&nbsp;telling me to bring home a nice, pretty, smart girl so soon I can bring them grandchildren!

I know it's pathetic, but I guess my only girlfriend are my studies. But, they're considering arranging an omiai for me! I don't want that! So, maybe looking for a girlfriend wouldn't hurt.

I also went to a music store to pick up Linkin Park's latest album, Minutes to Midnight, since I was too busy to get it when it first came out. It's good, but I think I still like their first album above all. I still like their hard rock sound from before. Listening to that music again made me want to pick up my guitar and start writing again. It's been a while since I've done anything productive with my guitar.

What I've also been looking into picking up again is tennis. It's been some time since I last played and I think I should start getting active again. it's no good to just sit around all day, ne? But, I don't really know anyone else who plays. Well, it shouldn't be too hard to find other players at the local park.

Na, Kusano-kun, I'm sorry I haven't been around lately. We haven't had the time to really get to know each other despite being rooommates, ne? I'll try harder!&nbsp;
Also, please don't try to skip classes on purpose by illness or injury! Maybe nakedness is a good reason to stay in. But, Kusano-kun, even I have to agree that we need our mental days off (but school's just started!). So, it's okay if you need a day of rest.

I also hope for some changes in terms of myself as a person. How I'm going to do that I'm not sure yet, but I am eager for it. Kusano-kun is my roommate this year. I'm eager to get to know more of my kouhai this year!<br /><br />Maa... Okaasan already insisted that I cut my hair when it had gotten too long over the summer since I was too busy with summer classes to care. Mou... I don't know why it has to be a... mohawk. I also got a nice new pair of glasses! Okaasan pushed me to get contacts, but I don't feel the need to bother myself with such things. <strike>I've worked hard to get a nice, new guitar! Of course, I had to bring it with me and probably play with no one looking.</strike><br /><br />Eh, what's this? Ghost-san is still causing trouble? Really... it's just a silly rumor! Don't let it distract you from your studies!<br /><br />Ne, minna-san in Dorm 3, please turn to me if you have any questions or concerns. I'm also open for any help not just of the dorm but in studies as well and I'll do what I can to help!<br /><br />[Edit] <strike>Where the hell is MY DRESSER?!</strike> Hmn... I should do my rounds to greet the Dorm 3 residents! I also seemed to have misplaced my dresser."

RP!SHIGE~ 
I'm gonna really emphasize the nerdineess and maturity in Shige here. Also, to make up for it,&nbsp;he's gonna try to be a sexy!nerd! Tell me that no one has some kind of glasses kink. XD So, when it comes to school, Shige has his glasses ready and books in hand. But, he won't be like that all the time! When no one's looking or listening, Shige can totally go into his rocker!mode. He can have his own fun too, ya know~ If Shige is dorm head of Dorm 3, he will try to be the responsible head he should be but... i'm expecting he might fail at some points. You can also turn to Shige for some tutoring sessions! Unfortunately, my Shige has gone strong resisting the urges of the effects of the many pretty boys in one school. Who knows if it may change this year! [EDIT} ya know what I'm just gonna add for fun... Shige's gonna be a bad drunk just as much as Sano is!

If anyone wants to create any other connections with Shige beforehand~ you can do so here~!"

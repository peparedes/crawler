"event","Comment on this post. I will choose seven interests from your profile and you will explain what they mean and why you are interested in them. Post this along with your answers in your own journal so that others can play along. The one's chosen for me are the following.

These were chosen for me by <lj user=""amkale24""> 

<u>802.11g</u> - this is the current standard for wireless internet. I love it.
<u>Glima</u> - this is an organization up in Port Huron that I'm part of. They are basically a networking group that you are a part of to connect to people in other businesses and learn a little bit about new technologies and stuff like that.
<u>Voip </u>- stands for Voice Over IP (Internet Protocol), so it's when you talk to someone else only using audio but it goes through the internet instead of traditional phone line systems. Skype is an example of a computer program that does this and our house phones are set up to go through our Comcast Cable Internet Connection.
<u>Worms World Party</u> - a video game available for many different consoles and platforms. In the game you command a team of worms that can use various weapons to destroy the opponents' worms. 
<u>Terabyte</u> - This is 1,024 Gigabytes. Soon computers will be using this more often when talking about the size of hard drives. 
<u>Mame</u> - This is the arcade game emulator that I used when I built my arcade computer/cabinet.
<u>My Big Toe</u> - This is on my interests list because I wanted to put some inside jokes on the list, like ""The UPS Guy"", Ruth Chavez, and Connor Fighting. The big toe joke was that I made a card for Erica once that listed my favorite things: cheese, games, you... (meaning her of course), and my big toe. It didn't make sense now and it didn't back then."

<lj-embed id=""9""/>

The reason it has that many views, figuring it's just a baseball cap, is because it was linked to on the front page of <a href=""http://www.applegeeks.com/index.php"">Applegeeks.com</a>. This idea is basically a running joke there because one of the two creators of the comic has never appeared in the comic, only in voice and as a hat which he always wears. Hee hee.

I submitted a design to shirt.woot.com. I'd want you to vote for it, but you can't unless you already bought a shirt from the site. Either way I'm excited because it's doing good so far (for only being the first 30 minutes of the contest). Wouldn't you want a shirt like this?"

So here are some search trends for me: I have done the most searches in the month of January, the day of Monday, and the hour of midnight.

If you use Google as your search engine, go to the Google homepage and log in to your g-mail. Then in the top right there is a link that says ""Web History"", then on the left there is a link that says ""trends"". 

Keep in mind that it will only show results for when you were signed in to Google and doing your search."

"event","I went to Nieman's Market yesterday and they were getting rid of some Diet Vanilla Coca-Cola, 8 for a dollar. Which is a spectacularly awesome deal. it's only 22.5 cents a piece including the deposit, which I should get back. So far I bought 32 bottles, and I plan on buying more.

Each bottle has a Coke Rewards code on them so you can get points on their website and earn something like a shirt or movie rental. So that's cool too.

This made me remember that when I was younger I would go into a store like O.J.'s party store or one of the many markets, and there used to be promotions like, ""1 in 6 caps wins a free 20 oz"" under the caps of Mountain Dew and Pepsi. I figured out that you could tilt the bottle and have a straight shot view of the bottom of the cap, and thus figure out if it said ""You win a free 20oz"" or ""Please Try Again"". So I bought one soda and kept choosing the winners, thus giving me about 20 free bottles over the promotion period when I only bought 1 soda.


And there you have the reason why my teeth are so bad.


Edit: I went back and bought 100 more bottles.

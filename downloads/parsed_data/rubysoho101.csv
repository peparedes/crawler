"event","well its been a while since i updated  things on here but its just been chaos. its been a mixture of  being so skint because  my loan hasn't  come through, and is  still in hiding, mucho uni work, and going between manchester and bolton to see  the other  half as hes been ill. in fact most  of the first term  seems to have passed me by- its gone ridiculously fast its  a tad  scary!

anyways......
will try  update  stuff now"

"event","well, exam stress is over and at the moment everythings a tad surreal. its also a bit of an anticlimax really. i mean, yeah i'm obviously glad stuffs over but its like ""what now""...
exams went ok, it could have been worse put it that way but fingers crossed i've passed. how unlucky can it be that i revise two topics kinda well and they both come up in the same question!??!
nevermind!
anyways...
last week i went to the ritz which was fun as i'd not be in ages (apart from the lame assed drunken attempt after deconstruction!). had a proper boogie and it was surprisingly quiet for a bank holiday/ half term ness. but none the less it was fun. last tuesday i went to see the bravery who were really good. sorry zoe for ringing you up but i think it needed to be heard as they sounded even better that on cd! my only issue was that they came on at 10pm and finished after 45mins. went to satans hollow afterwards but left early because of several issues. so i guess i was well prepared for my exams on thurs and friday!hehe!

i went shopping after work yesterday. its such a dangerous time for me to mix free time and a credit card and town. its just too much a temptation!!hehe! but i got some cool stuff but i gotta take back a bracelet as it broke-  i mean i had it literally 2hrs!! so hopefully get that sorted. also got a black and pink bag with skull and crossbones on and a variety of things that i should have left in the shop but i wanted.

going for a drink tonight with the people who are moving into the house in july so that should be fun and then a party next door. so alls well, it started to feel like i was the only one not going to torremolinos this year- an all night party at my university. 

hmmm.... ramblings...."

"event","whilst acknowledging that i have a 3000 word essay to do, i find it so much more productive  to waste time on random internetness and enjoy the  joys of msn to catch  up with various people. however, one is slightly more benefial than the other in actually helping me pass my degree...so obviously, i'm  doing the other!!

why do have the  attention span of a pea when it comes  to uni work!?!

"event","hmmm...
well, deconstruction was ace- apart from the fact i was horrendously wasted by 10pm due to mass drinkage. the bands were actually really good. wasn't a big fan of boy sets fire before but they really were good...i'm hoping thats not down to alcohol. After deconstruction i went to the ritz, briefly... i enjoyed the whole of 10minutes before sickness kicked in and i was sick quite literally everywhere and my friend had to take me home. I hit my head on the taxi door which resulted in mild concussion yesterday and much sickness. though i guess that serves me right!!
i've missed out my emotional outburst as i don't want to be reminded of it everytime i log in. 
Quite excited about tomorrow though, my housemate sarah's having a few days visit from germany, it's cool that i get to see her again as we all miss her. but on the plus side, she'll be back for good soon :) Think we're going to 5th avenue, which although its not my favourite place it'll be good to have the group back... i kinda miss the days of groupness when people didn't hate each other/ decide that some people weren't good enough.

anyhow...was going to get another tattoo today, but decided against it- i'm not in the happiest of times so i don't want a permanent reminder of how shitty i felt. me and zoe may become tattoo buddies, which will be cool!! definately something to consider."

"event","ho hum...
just having a break from my dissertation, so thought i'd give a quick update on whats happened of late! thankfully i'm seeing the end of my dissertation which is all good as it feels like ages since i've had normal social contact or even a conversation without having to mention the dreaded 'D Word'. 
Last week was uber fun, i spent most of it in a drunken haze/ hangover. Last tuesday i went to Satans Hollow- not been in ages but it was good to get out of the house, get really drunk and dance the night away. On the thursday i went out with work for a leaving do of one of my friends :( was a really good night though, and ended up in Jillys which again, not been for ages, so quite enjoyed it. On saturday i went to Rock Kitchen- i was so so drunk i don't think i should have left the house. And i embarrassingly and incoherently rambled to a girl at work. hmmm...

This week's a bit less active. I think its the fact everyone has ""d's"" and exams which sucks somewhat. Though i'm looking forward to deconstruction on monday! I've to the day of work and everything!may go to the Ritz after...who knows!!

anyways, enough work avoidance!!

"event","seen as its a new week and all, methinks  i should be a little more optimistic.
this comes after a really good lie in and lazy morning watching  austin powers  for the millionth time. i know i shouldn't  like it  but i do! oopsies!
also, i've  got into a top i bought a couple of  years ago  which i think makes any girl happy!!
not  really got any plans for  today,  may do a bit of reading- which  reminds me i still need to finish  reading lolita. i've  got itchy feet for a hair dying session but alas i don't have any :( nevermind. maybe  thats a good thing! stop me  from  making a  huge mistake or my hair falling out!hehe"

"event","In the midst of another boring sunday whilst sat in front of the  computer, i started to  think about being back home from uni. and i came to the conclusion that it officially sucks!

I mean, you go to uni, and when you come back at  holidays it seems all your friends have disappeared. like totally. what happened to the days when there was a huge group of us going out and having a blast? And why did i think they were the coolest thing since sliced bread when they obviously  don't give a second's thought about me and a couple of others who've moved away.

Its sad days. But at least now i guess this way you find out who you're real friends are!"

its saturday, i'm young free and single and what am i doing? no not dancing the night away, but staring at a computer screen *attempting* to do my dissertation.
and attempting is the operative word!
it sucks!
well...i've done 750 words...which is something i guess but a long way off the  target!"

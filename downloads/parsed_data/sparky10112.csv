"event","Love Means...
((a girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on a motorcycle))
Girl: Slow down. Im scared. 
Guy: No this is fun. 
Girl: No its not. Please, its 2 scary! 
Guy: Then tell me u love me. 
Girl: Fine, I love u. Slow down! 
Guy: Now give me a BIG hug. 
(Girl hugs him)
Guy: Can u take my helmet off &put it on? Its buggin me. 

In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. 2 people were on it but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his breaks were broken, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him, felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so she would live even though it meant he would die


i thought this was a funny lil saying
Life is all about ass:
You're either 
covering it, 
laughing it off, 
kicking it, kissing it, 
busting it, 
trying to get a piece of it, 
or behaving like one"

"event","so what's new? many things have come new to me recently. platano con salami, sketching, gettin ready to get out :) um..  drew ALOT today for ppl and myself :)

i can put an end to the triangle chapter of this year. x is cool, wife is cool. (very important that she is) and x is being super helpful and wife lets me draw her for practice. very cool. glad that didnt end in disaster. for a second her jealousy was drivin me nuts n pushin me away. now i know u'd be pissed off too but i asked her to trust me to take care of it so no one gets hurt and she didnt. that botehred me alot cuz the only reason she doesnt trust me is her own insecurities. i know how she feels cuz i had a huge problem with that but she admitted she doesnt have a reason to not trust me. 

but wouldnt you know it... it all turned out for the best. everyone's cool. (xcept my wife keeps refering to her as my gf. >:( ) she doesnt nag about her and no one's hurt. just like i wanted. and me and her get along so great now. all's good in the marriage. happy :)

in other news... 3 months 7 days left in the cream corn. i'm tryin to focus on my drawin alot more and coincidentally my job wants me to draw alot too so that's cool. gotta get things done to get my terminal approved. um... waht else. i went to my college interview and that was VERY upsetting.

i was a bit of a slacker so even though i graduated n everything, the art school wants a 3.0 and i have a 2.1 :(
how f'd up is that. i got low grades cuz i drew too much and it's slowing things down for me for an art school!!! AHHHHHHH!!!

very funny god.

oh, i tat'd my buddy. but get this... NO INK! weird huh? it's fully healed now. the tat i gave myself isnt. damn beach.

well that's all for now i guess."

"event","i havent been on this since late last year. i'm glad i didnt COMPLETELY forget about it cuz maybe sometime in the future i can see the differences between the me of now and every year before. i actually feel like a different person now. everyone's got their flaws and i actually know mine now. back then i used to blame everyone else. i think its being married that puts everything into a different perspective for me. 

i used to think that everyone is the same to a certain extent based on the people i've interacted with thruout my life until i met my wife. i've never met anyone like her. its her parents that raised her that way but they were probably raised the same too. now i'm not sayin that everyone ends up like their parents cuz i know ppl that have different values and morals than their parents. take my big bro's fiance for example, i hear that her mom wasnt the greatest and highly favored her brother even tho he's a dirt bag (from what i've heard). even though she grew up in a shitty house hold, she still somehow turned into probably the sweetest person i ever met. she's super nice, never gives my bro grief as faras i know and she gets along great with my parents. same goes for my twin bro's gf but they have a longdistance relationship. that always comes with baggage. abyway, back to what i was saying, i know that people don't have to end up with the same characteristics as their parents. i'm living proof myself. i dont have much in common with my parents but i still love them the same as i always have. 

the reason i bring this subject up is because my wife has some things about her that i know arent her fault. its her parents. i have no respect for those people and i blame them for her faults. not all of them though. there's some things that she picked up her self that arent anything to be applauded. every marriage has its problems and i think that ours is based on her actions. i'm not saying we have a horrible marriage, shit.. we spend more time alone doing things than anything. but when something bad happens between us its either her bad side coming out or her parents getting way too involved. 

i come from a VERY close family and everyone in it tells me that out of my brothers and i, i'm the one with the most family values. what i mean is that i'm the one who's closest to everyone else. i got that from my parents. they's been together since forever and i think thats the greatest thing ever and thats what i want. i didnt want in laws that i'd end up hating. i always wanted to be as close to them as i am with my family and that my family would like them too. my family has nothing to do with them and i'm actually glad about it. thats sad. its because my wife lets out our dirty laundry for her family to see. if i did that with my family they would hate me being with her. i love her. why would i want my family not liking her. thats why i dont understand why she tells her family things that would make them not like me. only difference is that unlike any normal family, hers gets directly involved and even does things against her wishes to see that me and her dont last. thats horrible.

i could tell my parents things about her that would have them not want us together and even then they wouldnt get involved like her parents. they'd respect me as an adult liek they always do and let me handle it. obviously he parents dont respect her as an adult. she tells me stories about her past taht involve her mom and i think they're horrible.i've never met anyone like them. its insane. her mom is the shadiest person i ever met in my LIFE. thats really bad considering the people i've had to deal with in the marine corps.

my wife supports me in many ways and i have her to thank for me being wherer i am today. i appreiate everything she ever did for me and i always let her know it. she's nuts about me too and i love that. she told me that i saved her life recently. i asked her how and she told me that if she would have gone back home after getting out of the marines, her life would have been shit and she'd probably be in a bad place. i think thats great and i'm glad i could be there for someone so important to me.

she used to want to end up in arizona after i got out then she told me she'd go wherever i wanted to be. she went so far as to say she loves me mor than her family which is crazy. my mom told me that once someone is married, their spouse should be more important. i agree. selena says i come first ut i dont always believe her based on what she's done. she would talk shit about me with them and her friends. speaking of her friends, why cant she ever be friends with someone respectable like my friends? all her female friends are cheating tramps and all her guy friends want a pieace of her. all my friends have respect for her just for being my wife and my parents are nice to her. i dont ever talk shit about her. i might mention something bad she might have done but i only do that when its something unforgivable that any normal person might leave someone for it in a heart beat. but like i said, i have strong family values and even stronger marriage values. thats why i dont cheat on her like i did to less deserving people.

that sounds f'd up but if u knew what i know, you'd agree. she's comin around but justwhen i think things are changing for the better, she does something new to make me think otherwise.

irght now things are weird between me and her. we're either extremely lovey dubby or at each others throats. never in between. i try to talk to her in hopes that when the conversation is over, things are back to good between us buch she's even more hard headed than me (which is INSANE b/c i'm very hard headed) so we end up stayin mad about whatever we were talkin about and then some. with her, if i'm not super happy i'm miserable. one or the other. never in between. she's done horrible things to me in the past and she thinks my grieving period should be over. or at least she acts like it. nonetheless i STILL try to get along with her and like other relationships in the past, i usually fix all the problems.

is there like a huge sign on my forehead that says ""i'll deal with whatever shit you throw at me.""? idk i mean i do alsways take a look inside myself to see if anything might be my fault and rarely is it ever. i'm very commited to my marriage. my life after the marines would be alot easier if i were alone but i wouldnt want that. there's no way i'd abandon my wife like that. she's helped me through alot like i have for her. we make a good team. only problem is that when we do have problems, they're huge. i'ma stop for now cuz she called me."

"event","i got married on the 15th of september. i'm happy too. my wife treats me so good and i do anything for her. me and her are 2 diff ppl than when we started dating. got my own place, car, everything i need. just waitin 2 get out of the marines. on a sad note, she had a miscarriage and that crushed me. i was happy about her being pregnant and got my hopes up. we'll try again in a year perhaps. 

since i'm on the subject of that... someone left a response to my last update and it kinda bothered me because it was anonymous and it sounded like someone from the past who is still bitter after all these years. kinda sad n weird if you ask me. and in my opinion, after reading it, i think they are worse than i was back then if they want to say something like that. it makes them just as bad as me back when i offended whoever wrote it. well now i know someone's still keeping tabs on me after so long. makes me wonder why they hqavent forgotten about me. i'm 23 years old now and married. almost was a daddy. definately not the same person. so i politely ask whoever wrote it to feel free to im me (SN's the same) and we can talk about it like adults and not fresh outta high school kids.

alot more is goin on in my life but i dont wanna put it down because i want to forget about it when its over. hard times. the marriage raises the quality of my life and i'm happier now and after this goes away i have alot to look forward to. mainly gettin out of the marines.

thats all for now."

"event","so what is the last thing i've put here? hmmm... lemme check. ok i see it. last time i updated it was when i broke up w/ abby on the 23rd. alot's happened since then. practically lived with ashley in the barracks for about 3 weeks which was all good n' what-not but then she started leavin me hangin. thing is i didnt even want n e thing 2 do w/ her after she did me dirty when i got back n tried sayin wusup. that was my point of no return. so as far as she goes i've given up on that and and movin on w/o her. cuz if u didnt know... yeah... i'm on restriction again. lol. i've had it since the 15th of last month and not once has she came to see me. she finally sed she would this past weekend but i told her not to and there's reasons for that. meanwhile back at the ranch, abby has been callin me often. i knew she was B.S.'n bout not bein able 2 call but it turns out she had a bf like right away. doesnt phase me at all though really. she's borin on the phone. a lil more bout her in a sec. met a chick named danielle... wasnt feelin her. she got a tat of sumthin i drew in like 5 min or less though which is pretty cool. that makes about 5-7 ppl... i cant remember right now. lotta crazy stuff's happened and blah blah blah like toga parties and ganj and... get this... la blanca. if u know me and u just read that u'd be like WTF. but yeah i saved the best news for last. reason i dont wanna see ash (besides the usual) and reason why abby stopped tryin 2 get at me is because i am no longer single. thats right i'm currently involved after about 3 1/2 months and it just came outta the blue. it's been pretty good so far though it's only been 3 days or so. it's not long distance for once like ever other. in fact, she lives in the same barracks as me so i stay over every night. her name is selena. some ppl say that we are both very much alike. more on that later cuz i am at work."

"event","wow i havent updated in quite some time now. and i always seem to do so when its late as hell. oh well. so lets see... i got alot of catchin up to do. this may take a hot minute. ok here we go...

so i get back to the states on the 1st of nov. and imediately go on leave. my parents came down to get me but b4 i left, while they were sleepin in the telly i went to 4 bars. got DRUNK as hell and met weirdos in the hidden bar behind the telly. parents drove a hung over jarold to jerz. chilled w/ shal. we got along better than usual. met abby. very memorable first date. saw her again the next day and she asked me out. for those of you who didnt know, i came back with the intentions of not getting with anyone exclusively. especially distance. so i told her i'll think about it (she knew why) so i thought about it and despite my own wishes to myself, i decided ""sure why not"" so when i saw her again it was official. so i am now curently involved with a lovely elizabeth abigale estelle (abby for short). meanwhile, me n shalimar hung out alot and i even stayed over a few times and there was def. alot of tension but nothing happened.

after i got back me n abby stayed in touched and learned alot about each other and i talked to shal as well. she revealed hidden feelings and complications arose. so i was ALMOST at a cross road. went to jerz pretty much every weekend of nov. abby came to NC all the way from jersey to be my date for the marine corps ball and we had a good time. but, and i hate to confess, right before she cae i went to raleigh to get my things i left b4 going to africa and i met up with ashley. i went with kevin so he didnt wanna stick around so she offered to drive me all the way back to jacksonville which is 2 hrs away. when we got there it was about 12 am and i told her we couldnt get on base so we got a telly. we chilled.. stuff happened.. and the next morning we went on base. i left the keys in the telly so we had 2 return and i went 2 work while she slept in my room. i came back for lunch, we showered though i didnt need one lol and thankfully she went home cuz abby was drivin down from jersey at the same time. abby got there later that night and the next day was the ball. ppl tell me she was the prettiest date there and that she's a keeper. a little more on that in a second. well 5 days later i'm in jerz again and ash im's me askin me if we'd get back together. that conversation was... well i wont forget it. so she's out of the picture after all the stuff that happened while i was away. then me n shal got to talkin and i hung out with her one day and we saw the incredibles where she kept starin at me. we went back to her place and she suggested we drank red bull n vodka. well needless to say, whatever she was tryin 2 do worked and we did ""it"" for the first time ever. that's where the crossrads appeared. she asked me who i wanted to stay with and it was hard... really hard. but she never tried convincing me to leave abby. in fact she's the one who told me to just stay with her. the thing with shalimar is that she decides to tell me vital things when its too late. so after like 2 weeks of me bein confused, she sez fuck it stay with abby and i ask her if it'll affect our stronger friendship and if she's gonna be left hurt. she sez no. the next day she shows me HER live journal and basically it sez she feels rejected and hurt. so i'm like wtf. and she goes into like a month long depression spree. i tried makin her feel better and we had alot of serious talks and in the end she's like ""whenever you end it with abby i'll be here"" then changes it to she's cool with friends with benefits but not while i'm with abby cuz she dont wanna be the other girl. which i definately understand. also, one night i got drunk and i knew a female co-worker of mine was at the club so i went there, danced with her twice and brought her to my room. bad night. helled at the fuckers callin my room and listening from the outside at her makin noises. losers.

then i go on leave. me n abby have been arguin here n there. i think its cuz she's actin like,,, idk,, i never been with a girl like her and she's very complicated. i mean she does things for me that no one would or has ever done to show me how she feels and that alone should make me not let n e thing else matter but the way she was comparedto now has changed. one second she seems like she's not into ""us"".. the next she blows me away by doing something awesome. she got me something for christmas that's unbelievable. yeah i feel like a jerk for cheating on her. no excuse for that. and my mom thinks she's great. and she actually talks w/ my mom and does alot for me. great girl. i just have trust issues i guess. even though i'm the one who shouldnt be trusted. and knowing this, i cant help it. somethin aint right... i need to know what has me like this. maybe its my age. idk. well anyway, so i'm on leave. me n abby chill. me n shal chill. nothing ever happened b/w me n her ever again. b4 i left to DR we had a good long talk and i finally let her know somethings b/c up until then i got everything outta her and left her hangin always. abby did some things to upset me too. then... after 6 yrs.. i went to DR.

when i got there.. the smell alone made me fall in love with the place. then i saw family i hadnt seen in a long time and within the first 30 min i didnt wanna leave. while i was there for a week i did alot of stuff rangin from watchin em kill a rabbit and prepare it all the way till me n my DR crew ate it to swimming in a river to clubbin. met a girl named adelyz. pretty dominican girl. i think she thinks we're bf n gf cuz the day i left she told me to behave in the states. lol. well i had such a good time that i decided to stay for a year after i get out. then go to art school. i could even drive w/o a license. and with my american money i could get a car there for cheap. i could find a job easy too. and my family rules so it'd be like a 1 yr vacation with a job lol if that makes any sense. came back. say shal and abby the same day. came back to NC. the next day abby came down too and we chilled thru the new year till earlier today (well yesterday technically) and i missed her right away.  i gave her the present i got her and she reacted like i dint think she would so now i'm kinda worried. and i've been bored all day.

i also forgot to mention my paintballin' experience. i had the awesomest time. worm sez i play better than.. and i quote.. ""most of them tournament fuckers"" lol
i thought that was cool. i was on night crew for a while till they made everyone day crew for the holidays. i cant wait till night crew's back on cuz i like it better. i cant remember what else has been goin on since i got back and i cant promise i'll remember to add it here since i hardly remember anymore to update this. i cant believe i've been doin this for so long now. one day i'll take the time to see what i've been doing for the last few years and compare it to now a-days. one thing's for sure.. since i been back i have a completely diff. view of things. from my future plans all the way to how i see relationships to the music i listen to (mostly spanish) and other aspects of my life. my future for the next year and 11 months or so is pretty much pre-determined as far as the marine corps go but even in the marine corps its up n down. after that, my life's wide open and idk if i'll be married or single or even have a kid. i'm very excited to see what happens though. kinda worried too. idk, life's a crazy ride and i'm hanging on still. i guess i have god n my family to thank for that. 

wow, i wrote alot this time around. hope i didnt miss anything. definately time to go to sleep. hope i'm not late tomorrow (damn work)"

"event","so whats new? i go home soon! yay! what else? i should be chillin for the rest of the time here. sara's all pissy cuz ash dont want me talkin to her. that's if i go back out with her. but i dont know what her deal is. talkin about missin me and still lovin me but goin on dates with these guys she met in ""3"" months. just talkin bout them. then bob's back.. omg. and then this! :

damn, ashley just pissed me off wit her stupid bullshit, i wish there was a day where guys can hit girl, i'd smack the pure shit outta her, i never thought about hittin a girl b/4, always been against it and even got pissed when i heard about a guy smackin a girl,,,,but damn, no wonder her dad and jarold put there hands on her,,,she's annoying as hell and she thinks she's the victom. lately, me and a few people have been talkin good about jarold. ashley probably didnt tell us the whole story. i didnt know dat ashley fucked his best friend and found out about it. i use the think he was too controlin,,,but i dont blame him at all. so jarold, if u read this,,,,dont make the mistake of messin wit dat lil girl, stick wit the ones u got.

that was her ex sean that she cheated on me with. and to top it off i dont hear from her till today. when i do hear from her she's always distracted by more important things i guess. the good thing is that it doesnt bother me that much. she about flipped out when i mentioned i talked to SA on the phone but tells me shit about her guy friends and how they hit on her and sum like her and she COULD hook up with some blah blah blah. jesus. i dont know what to think of her but sadly it seems like... ugh... i'll just keep that to myself. she needs to get her shit together. i think the only person who gives a fuck is me and when i suggest the right thing or the smart thing i think she takes it and does the opposite. still aint done with school. livin at her friends. makin a mess there too... and there's no way you can confront her about this kinda stuff cuz she cant take constructive critisism. ever. and when she has a window of opportunity she never capitalized on it. and here i am goin on and on about what she needs to do and all this stuff she should know and when she sees this i expect to hear shit about it. but i wont deal with it if she gets stupid.

abby said she'd drive down to NC for the ball. but now she sez that if it's the 9th she cant but if it's the 11th she can. its the ninth. pooie. 

my dad got a herniated disc in his back. i thought he couldnt get me so ash sed she'd do it. that woulda been cool. but he can now so i can be in jersey right away :) and he sed he could take dicen too. sweet. he'll bring my paintball stuff so i wont hafta drag it back 2 NC. cant wait! AHHHH! lol

what else? um... sent my mum flowers. she loved em. sent a pic with her n the flowers lol. my bro got a car. we'll be traveling alot. i hope i dont go on the boat. man alot has happened since i last updated. there's prob stuff i forgot but i'll get it later i guess. well that's it for now. and i'm assuming that if ash gave me sean's link to his journal then she gave him mine. drama queen. she needs to chill and grow up a lil. there's no way you can tell her that without offending her. i tried. she doesnt want help even though i coulda done so. oh well

thats all for now."

Gzmn RD 4j: nah
mary: we already got intimate

Gzmn RD 4j: wow
Gzmn RD 4j: ok
Gzmn RD 4j: well....
Gzmn RD 4j: want my opinion?
mary: sure
Gzmn RD 4j: ok
Gzmn RD 4j: well the way i see it i dont think there's a time limit on when u should fall for anyone so if thats how you say you feel i wont hold it against you. secondly, you gotta think about what you're gettin out of bein with him and if u'r that serious with him... u can try 2 see if u see u'rself w/ him a few more weeks or months down the road. if so... put up with him 4 now and see if u can stand how he's bein or if u think it's hopeless just save yourself some time
mary: wow
mary: good advice
mary: i like the way u set it up both ways
mary: as in my decision
mary: most people say. you gotta leave him!! or u gotta wait!!
Gzmn RD 4j: u really think it's good advice? cool.... well u really need to think about it
Gzmn RD 4j: how old are you two
mary: i kno
mary: im 18
mary: hes 25
Gzmn RD 4j: ok
mary: bad?
Gzmn RD 4j: dont get offended when i give u the next bit of advice
Gzmn RD 4j: and dont think i'm being biased cuz i been in his shoes
mary: k
Gzmn RD 4j: me 21 with an 18 hr old
Gzmn RD 4j: now i'm 22
Gzmn RD 4j: well her mom told her something which i found out the hard way was true
mary: k
Gzmn RD 4j: the older you are the more you feel like you need to settle down or something similar and girls your age usually want to just have someone and be happy but not think about anything further than that. well he might be actin that way cuz of that and doesnt wanna freak you out or something
Gzmn RD 4j: but i could be wrong
mary: hes told me
mary: that he wants to be married really soon
Gzmn RD 4j: damn
mary: 2yrs tops!
mary: not with me
mary: because i told him in the beginning
Gzmn RD 4j: well in 2 yrs i can understand that
mary: that i dont rush into that kind of commitment
Gzmn RD 4j: but u guys havent been goin out even close to that long
mary: and he basically said he doesnt kno where i stand with it
mary: yeah.
mary: he wants kids soon too
mary: he just really wants to start his life
mary: n i feel like im getting in his way
mary: like. using up time
mary: or wasting his time
Gzmn RD 4j: so pretty muc he's tellin you ""ok you got until you're 20 to see if u wanna marry me and i'll wait till then to find out"" ?
mary: if things dont turn out for marriage
mary: no.
mary: basically telling me
mary: tell me now if u'll marry me
Gzmn RD 4j: wowo
Gzmn RD 4j: impossible
mary: or even lets go get engaged.
mary: or..
mary: let go of me
mary: so i can get a girl
Gzmn RD 4j: impossible
mary: so in 2 yrs
mary: we can get married
mary: a girl his age
Gzmn RD 4j: ok think of it this way
Gzmn RD 4j: u think things'll be the same in another 2 months?
Gzmn RD 4j: assuming u'r still together
mary: in this bad situation?
Gzmn RD 4j: right
mary: yeah
mary: i think we're stuck like this
mary: if he keeps acting that way
mary: his excuse for ignoring me
Gzmn RD 4j: ok so times these 2 months by 11
Gzmn RD 4j: u think u can handle that? jsut to make him happy?
mary: ill die
mary: and turn grey
Gzmn RD 4j: lol
Gzmn RD 4j: exactly
mary: loseee happiness 
Gzmn RD 4j: exactly
mary: he said tho
mary: that he'd never give me up for nothing..nothin in this world
mary: his exact words
mary: then WHY THE FUCK do u treat me like im nothing?!
mary: that i have no business in what ur going thru
mary: or that im not worth 5minutes of ur time in the day to see what im doing..or if im okay?
Gzmn RD 4j: so you're tellin me he treats u like u'r invisible and he expects more from you than you even know
mary: hes just avoiding me
mary: and then blames it on stress
mary: or that hes too busy or whatever
Gzmn RD 4j: that sounds like a pussy ass excuse
mary: and im supposed to just be okay with being not taken care of
mary: i need a man who can give me attention
mary: and talk to me 
mary: almost every day
Gzmn RD 4j: i feel u
mary: i need that support
mary: and affection
Gzmn RD 4j: everyone does
mary: its hard to have a man
Gzmn RD 4j: hard 2 find sum 1 like that
mary: and be committed
mary: when i dont get that from him
Gzmn RD 4j: a man? girls are just as complicated
mary: no im saying
mary: its hard to be tied down to him
mary: when i dont get my needs
mary: when ive got other dudes talking to me every day
mary: telling me this and the other
Gzmn RD 4j: then if u aint gettin anything out of it + everything else i mentioned... what's keepin u around?
mary: thats the mysterious thing
mary: i cant let go of this one for some reason
mary: i just cant
mary: just the vibe he gives me
mary: in his presence
Gzmn RD 4j: damn u'r not gonna like this...
mary: what
Gzmn RD 4j: u might just be infatuated or some puppy love
Gzmn RD 4j: and i'm havin deja-vu all of a sudden typin that
mary: what
mary: with who
Gzmn RD 4j: i just feel like i've sed that 2 sum 1 before
mary: i think me
mary: haha
Gzmn RD 4j: but yeah u'r just infatuated or it's just puppy love u got w/ him
mary: how are u so sure
Gzmn RD 4j: i'm not sayin it's definate.. just my opinion
Gzmn RD 4j: cuz ok...
mary: oh
Gzmn RD 4j: if u'r not happy at all but u like bein around him cuz u've been intimate then it's because u'r infatuated
mary: wait
mary: listen to this recent text message
mary: i said to hi\m... is it us thats stressing u out? 
mary: he said ""huh. no baby, dont try to figure anything out. u just gotta be patient and if its too hard then let me know""

Slightly Happy
Your score is 58. 


You are slightly happy, but not really happy, you are on the border of happyness and unhappyness, stay close to those you care about and you will be fine.  


i agree. maybe i do need to concentrate on the ppl who care more and not pay much attention to the rest. never though that would be a good way to stayin happy. sounds good though.

ate some real chicken today. seasoned fresh chicken that prob came from a chicken that was killed recently and not f'd w/ scientificaly or reformed or any of that garbage. slept less than 3 hrs. runnin on fumes. work sucks. i know. tired. getting.... sleepy.... must... go.... smoke....

"event","so yesterday i was chilin with mike after work. we went to the mwr tents to go online and i wanted to go eat. well i wanted to go  but he was talkin to his bro from japan. so i told him to gimme a SN so i wouldnt be bored waitin and he gives me his girl. well after all the introductions and all that, she told me she wants him to call. i told him and he just wanted to go watch star wars. i tried helpin her out and she sounded really sad about it and sed ""not even for two minutes?"" and then i tried convincin him with no luck.

     so i started tellin her to try not to let her bother her so much because i went through the same thing and the whining turned to arguing turned to fighting lead to break up. well i learned something from this. i learned that when it comes down to it... i used to think that i needed support from the ppl back home but in actuality i've come to realize that it is them who need us. they are the ones who get bent out of shape when we dont call. i say this because they dont understand that phone cards cost money and the situation out here isnt all peaches n cream. its alot harder than what we're allowed to say and if they cant get that then they're only thinkin of themselves. why else would they be so crazy about gettin called EVERY single day? so i have come to the conclusion that if i'm ever put in the situation of getting deployed and am spoken for, i'm not gonna call much and make it seem like it's even harder than it already is so they wont get comfortable gettin a call everyday and are used to spontaneous calls. that way each call is more precious and worthwhile and conflict doesnt occur and if they're doin somethin stupid back home (which i'm starting to realize is inevitable) i wont really worry about it. that's a big chunk of worries gone away and life made easier. 

     now i have a clearER (not clear.. never clear) idea of what it might take to make shit work out years from now when i decide to be in a relationship again. put logic first instead of what i want. i like this entry and i think i'll mark it for future references."

     anyway i got my cure cd. brings back some memories. some of those songs are deep as hell. my fav. songs on that are: this is a lie, jupiter crash & numb. i doubt most of the ppl who bother readin this borin journal know n e thing about what i'm talkin about lol.

SA told me that she missed me this weekend.

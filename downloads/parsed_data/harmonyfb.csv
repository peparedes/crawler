"event","Things are stressful around our house right now. Manly has to have eye surgery (he has to have the vitreous humor removed from one of his eyes, and diabetic-related damage fixed. It&#39;s gross and terrifying), and the cherry on that sundae is the $2,000.00 copay. For which they won&#39;t let us make payments - it&#39;s 100% up-front.

Also, Mom took a fall, and after complaining to the doctor for two weeks that she was really hurting badly, he <i>finally </i>agreed to do an MRI, which revealed that she&#39;d fractured her hip and wrist. So she&#39;s in a wheelchair for 8 weeks (with the doctor stressing that she can&#39;t put <i>any </i>weight on her hip - gee, it would have been nice if she hadn&#39;t spent two weeks walking around on it while you ignored her complaints), and I&#39;m stuck down here unable to help. (And my brother, the asshole, actually went to our hometown for something last weekend, and didn&#39;t even <i>call </i>her. He knows she&#39;s stuck in a wheelchair, living alone - though happily, she has a couple of friends who are helping out - and he was <i>totally </i>unconcerned. I texted him and asked him to go by because I was worried about her, and he was <i>there in town</i>, and his remark was &quot;Well, you can just call her.&quot; WTF is <i>wrong </i>with my brother?)

Anyway, I&#39;m spending a lot of time online talking about inconsequential things so I don&#39;t have to think about it. But if you&#39;re wondering why you haven&#39;t seen me &#39;round, now you know."

"event","Been thinking a lot about small-screen &amp; big screen vampire characters, and trying to hunt up new films/series to watch, which involves reading a lot of on-line &#39;top ten&#39; lists. People have weird tastes, is all I&#39;m sayin&#39;.

So I was thinking about my favorites, many of which I can&#39;t even remember the <i>titles</i> of (but they have scenes which are etched in my memory forever.) Bear in mind that I haven&#39;t seen some which are mentioned fondly these days (like <i>Let the Right One In</i>, because of the bullying scenes, which are too scary for me. Don&#39;t trip over my emotional baggage, there.)

<lj-spoiler title=""Vampire Movies - a list of ten favorites"">
11. Perfect Creature (2006) - a world in which vampires are part of the church, fed by the faithful&#39;s blood donations. A priest helps a local detective investigate a series of murders which appear to be perpetrated by a vampire. Complicated storyline, but really great art direction and acting.

<lj-embed id=""66""/>

10. Shadow of the Vampire (2000). A fictional tale about the filming of the silent &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, supposing that &quot;Max Shrek&quot; really was a vampire. The beautiful scene where the very alien Nosferatu talks about not remembering the taste of bread was mesmerizing.

<lj-embed id=""67""/>

9. Nightlife (1989) - a made-for-tv movie about a vampire girl trying to get away from her douchebag undead boyfriend (&quot;I buried myself for a hundred years to get away from you - can&#39;t you take the hint?&quot;) which is hilarious and highly quotable. (&quot;The cops...they found a guy with all his blood sucked out and they wanted a medical opinion.&quot;/&quot;Oh, so what did you tell them?&quot;/&quot;He had all its blood sucked out. They were right.&quot;)

<lj-embed id=""68""/>

8. Rockula (1990). I know, I know, but give it a chance. This film is hi-larious, and has a great soundtrack. Thomas Dolby is a riot as a funeral home magnate, and Toni Basil plays the Vampire Mom.

<lj-embed id=""69""/>

7. The Hunger (1983) - Catherine Denueve, David Bowie, and Susan Sarandon star in this sexy, stylish, and very deadly vampire tale.

<lj-embed id=""70""/>

6. Martin (1978) - George Romero&#39;s vampire story, in which we&#39;re never certain whether the titular character is really a vampire, or whether he&#39;s just a serial killer. Shot in a realistic style which makes the viewer highly uncomfortable. It has a truly <i>shocking</i> ending that will stick with you.

<lj-embed id=""71""/>

5. The Lost Boys (1987) - Humorous, unsettling, and so. much. fun. Starring Kiefer Sutherland as a cool-kid vampire.

<lj-embed id=""72""/>

4. Blood and Donuts (1995) - A low-budget film about folks living on the edge of society. The vampire character is living a life just as quietly desperate as the other down-and-outs that populate this film. Has a creepy cameo by David Cronenberg as a local crime boss.

<lj-embed id=""73""/>

3. Only Lovers Left Alive (2014) - less of a movie and more of a slice-of-life piece (peacockharpy called it a &quot;tone poem&quot;) about two vampires who are in love with one another. Starring Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston as Eve and Adam, light and dark, nature and invention. It&#39;s just beautiful.

<lj-embed id=""74""/>

2. Near Dark (1987) - In spite of some confusing vampire lore, this film about a small-town boy who gets picked up by a pack of predators (and turned by the girl he flirts with) is a great ride. It examines the nature of predators, group dynamics, love and attraction, you name it. It doesn&#39;t flinch away from how violent a vampire&#39;s existence would have to be, and it keeps tension all the way through.

<lj-embed id=""75""/>

1. This spot had to go to a Hammer film, because they were the base upon which I built my love of all things blood-sucking. But which one? Maybe Brides of Dracula (1960)? Basically, any Hammer vampire movie <i>except</i> &quot;The Bloodsuckers&quot; or &quot;Dracula, A.D. 1972&quot;.

<lj-embed id=""76""/>

Honorable mentions should go to &quot;Queen of Blood&quot; (1966), which had a bloodsucking alien and a scene which stuck with me my entire life since I saw it on a late-night Creature Feature somewhere around 1973, and &quot;Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter&quot;.

<lj-embed id=""77""/>
</lj-spoiler>
Of course, I left out tons of vampire movies that I enjoyed, because ten is a small number. &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;, &quot;Blood: The Last Vampire&quot;, &quot;Thirst&quot;, etc, etc.

Did I miss any vampire movies that <i>you</i> love? Tell me, tell me!"

1) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Night-Gardener-Jonathan-Auxier-ebook/dp/B00JVY32QA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414761730&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+night+gardener"">The Night Gardener</a> by Jonathon Auxier - this is a story about wishes, and how they can corrupt you if you let them have too much power. Juvenile fiction, but middle-grade vocabulary. I&#39;d say suitable for ages 8-12 (unless your kid is a precocious reader and likes scary stuff.)

2)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Insanity-Susan-Vaught-ebook/dp/B00HYCGFF6/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414762348&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=insanity""> Insanity</a> by Susan Vaught - YA title about a haunted insane asylum turned modern mental hospital, and the people with otherworldly abilities (possibly fairy-related ancestry) who are drawn there to keep the ghoulies at bay. Very atmospheric, and a fun, easy read. (Some cursing - &#39;bitch&#39;, for ex,, and references to child murder, so I&#39;d recommend 12 and up as a general rule. YMMV, of course.)

Next I&#39;m going to read &quot;The Doubt Factory&quot; by Paolo Bacigalupi - I love his work, even if it&#39;s occasionally difficult reading."

"event","TL; DR: Weird dream.

I dreamed that I was driving home (in somebody else&#39;s SUV) and inadvertently drove into a neighborhood where there was a riot. Somebody hit the back of the car with a brick. After a while, I decided that I was making a target of myself in the giant car, so I parked it and hid in a house where all the lights were on and the doors were open, but nobody was home.

I was standing in the living room, wondering if it was safe to try and leave, when the residents came home - an elderly woman and her adult granddaughter. They were sweet and understanding about me hiding in the house, and shared their supper with me (black beans &amp; rice with plantains, yum). I got the woman&#39;s name and phone number and address, and swore to bring her something (the granddaughter said &quot;She prefers a packed hamper&quot;, ie, a picnic basket) The next morning, Manly showed up with the kids looking for me. I traded cars with him, and tried to drive home, but I got turned around, and wound up driving down a river, and then up an escalator, and then into the second floor of a hotel, and then outside the hotel there was this <i>&quot;Lord of the Rings </i>Land&quot; where there were sculptures and mini-golf-sized replicas of the set pieces, and I got stuck in there and couldn&#39;t figure out how to drive out.

Eventually, Manly found me (again), and I followed him to the parking lot. I was super-nervous about following him to the interstate, because I was clearly too rattled to drive. Weird."

"event","I had a really strange dream. In it, I woke in a strange place that looked vaguely like a church parish hall. There was another woman there unknown to me who had woken up at the same time, and she and I were trying to figure out what happened. At one point, an albino African-American man came into the room and spoke to us, but we couldn&#39;t hear his voice.

Eventually we made our way into the rest of the building, and met a short, no-nonsense woman who informed us that we&#39;d be there helping other people - babies, toddlers, etc. She deflected all my entirely-reasonable questions until I bugged her so much that she told me no, it was not a vision or spiritual experience, but I had in fact been drugged and kidnapped, no, I couldn&#39;t leave for six months, and no, she wouldn&#39;t let me call my family to let them know I was ok.

I stomped out of the building, and took off down the road, and she sent two mutant lambs after me (idek; they were creepy.) I realized I couldn&#39;t make it on foot, so I snuck back and stole the keys to a motorbike (except...it was more like a motorized fainting couch. With a giant smokestack and no seat belt or helmet.) I drove hell-for-leather toward the nearest town, terrified that I&#39;d crash and die because it was a ridiculously dangerous mode of transportation.

What. the. Heck? My subconscious is seriously weird."

See the three full bookcarts surrounding my chair? See the three separate piles of books/dvds/cds on my desk? I am <i>busy</i>. If you need a book checked out, that&#39;s my job. If you need a book renewed, that&#39;s my job. If you need a dvd, that&#39;s my job.

If you have a computer question? That&#39;s the job of the lazy librarian facing away from the computers, doing nothing but surfing the web. GO ASK THEM.

On a related topic, I&#39;m sure you can see that there are three stations at this desk. Two of them are not currently manned. I am sitting at the third one, ready and willing to help you. So why, in the name of all that is holy, would you go and stand at an empty one after you made eye contact with me? And then look irritated when I call you to come down to the part of the desk where I&#39;m seated?

Also, <i>ms-110%-sure-I-returned-that-book</i>, do you know how many patrons pull that crap every day? And how many ninja-drop that book they were <i>eleventy-one!!!110%</i> sure they returned some months later? Hundreds, that&#39;s how many. Yep, I found your book on the shelf (because somebody isn&#39;t checking stuff in properly, or we have a grabby volunteer), and I apologized. But next time, can you please be a bit less snide? Because I was thisclose to losing my <strike>job</strike> temper.


<b>Dear I Requested This Yesterday Why Isn&#39;t It Here Dude:</b>

1. That item is checked out. It&#39;s the only one of them. You have to wait for that other patron to bring it back. Yep, it was due back yesterday. They haven&#39;t brought it back yet. You want the director&#39;s phone number so you can complain that I&#39;m not giving you the item? Good luck with that. (This went on every day for a week. No exaggeration.)

2. We don&#39;t own a teleporter. Yes, that item is marked &quot;shipped&quot;. That means it&#39;s either a)on a shelf in the back of the owning library, waiting to be picked up, b) on a truck going to a warehouse, or c) sitting in the warehouse waiting to be sorted and shipped back out. It takes <i>at least</i> five days (more if it was tagged to transfer on a Friday, because there&#39;s no shipping on Saturday or Sunday.) No, it&#39;s not here yet. No, it&#39;s not here yet. No, it&#39;s not here yet. Oh, you want the Director&#39;s number so you can complain about it? Go for it, asshole. (This also went on for seven days.)

3. Yes, it&#39;s finally here. Oh, you don&#39;t have your card OR your ID? We can&#39;t let you have it. Nope, not even if you whine. Not even if you yell. Nope, not even if you threaten (to get me fired). Nope, nope, nope. And what&#39;s more, I won&#39;t even confirm that it&#39;s the one you&#39;ve been waiting on, because - privacy issues. Sucks to be you. Oh, you want the Director&#39;s number so you can complain that I&#39;m doing my job per his instructions? Good luck with that, asssshole. (Or, you could, you know, just go home and get your damn library card.)

::adds another patron to the list of &#39;I&#39;m not going to wait on that asshole again&#39; glory:: That list? Is the one where I get up and leave the desk when I see them. It includes the woman who called the police on me when I asked her to lower her voice on her prohibited cell phone call, the hateful woman who stands at the desk and curses at me every time she comes in, the guy who caused a 45-minute scene because we wouldn&#39;t give him his way - after we&#39;d told him no on the phone before he came over, and the guy who tried to get me to go out with him for months after I&#39;d politely told him I wasn&#39;t interested and - by the way - was happily married. It&#39;s an elite list, you see.

Just fyi, if you see a library worker with a fixed smile and narrowed eyes, you&#39;ll know that in their head, your village is in flames."

Well, I say &quot;lots&quot; - more like, &quot;I have important shows to watch and books to read&quot;. ::shrug:: I&#39;ve also done some writing on &quot;Gnaw Bones&quot;, which is good. I&#39;ve discovered some new music, too, but that&#39;s a whole different post.

<b>Work</b>:

Right now, we&#39;re looking at a December start for our library&#39;s renovation (during which we&#39;ll not only be closed, but I&#39;ll be doing nothing but processing (lot of re-labeling lined up, oy.) Supposedly, the Korean dramas which I purchased (with my own money) and donated will actually get cataloged during the closure (because right now, they&#39;re sitting in a pile on the librarian&#39;s desk - having to build a whole bib record means nobody wants to do it. Meanwhile, I am dying because I want to press them on patrons, but I can&#39;t.)

<b>Books:</b>

<i>The Mirror Empire</i> by Kameron Hurley. Dude, this woman is one of the best world-builders out there. Her characters are fully-realized, the cultures are rich and distinct, and her plots are intricate and engrossing. Also, really violent. If you&#39;re a &quot;cross-brainer&quot; like me, you&#39;ll adore her books.

<i>In Dark Service</i> by Stephen Hunt. Same guy who wrote &quot;Court of the Air&quot; and its sequels. Another fantastic tale of adventure and excitement, with complex moral themes, staggeringly awesome world-building, and more colorful characters than you can shake a stick at. Read it.

<i>Hidden</i> by Benedict Jacka. An &#39;Alex Verus&#39; novel - more magick and political manuevering and down-and-out mages. Kind of a poor man&#39;s Dresden (don&#39;t let that description put you off; they&#39;re fun.)

<b>Upcoming Books I&#39;m All Excited About:</b>

<i>Jacaranda </i>by Cherie Priest. She&#39;s one of my very favorite writers, and this looks like more steampunky fun. (Due out in Jan.)

<i>The Just City</i> by Jo Walton. Nuff said. Also due out in January.

<i>The Whispering Storm</i> by Michael Moorcock - yes, a new book by him! First in, what, ten years? How exciting!

<i>Soul of the Fire </i>by Eliot Pattinson - another in his Tibetan series; beautiful and disturbing mysteries set in Tibet during the 80&#39;s, featuring a Chinese detective who is a former political prisoner. Sometimes difficult reading, but very absorbing.

<b>Television I&#39;m Hooked on This Fall:</b>

<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</i>: Holy cow, they are killing me with this Fitz-Simmons storyline. ::clutches heart:: <i>Right in the fangirl.</i>

<i>Possessed </i>(Also known as &#39;<i>Hon</i>&#39; or &#39;<i>Soul</i>&#39;): Korean show about a girl who can not only see ghosts, but who gets possessed by them. Sort of. Part ghost story, part murder mystery, part revenge fantasy...super-duper CREE. PEE. (Available on Hulu)

<i>My Secret Hotel:</i> Korean murder mystery with a side of divorced-couple-reunites-or-do-they? Any show that starts with a dead body dropping onto a wedding is gonna be on my thumbs-up list.

<i>Blade Man</i>: Korean. Ok, I know this sounds stupid, but hear me out. It&#39;s about a guy who can sprout literal knives from his body when he&#39;s angry or upset. It&#39;s very comic-book-esque, and there&#39;s a heart to it. Very tender story which explains the seriously freaking weird superpower. Lots of martial arts. Just trust me.

<i>Misfits</i>: British show about teenage criminals sentenced to community service who get struck by lightning and develop really crappy superpowers. Hilarious, and yet, kind of creepy. Five seasons worth on Hulu, though I&#39;m still in S1.

<i>Grimm</i>. Starts back up next week!!! Monsters and snark!! Oh, Monroe, I missed you!

<b>Television I Tried and Couldn&#39;t Get Into</b>

<i>Gotham</i>: Eh. The only reason to watch is the baby penguin (geez, that guy is creepy) and future Comissioner Gordon.

<i>Sleepy Hollow</i>: There&#39;s only so much that can be covered with snark and a long coat, y&#39;all.

<i>Gracepoint</i>: It&#39;s ok. I&#39;d just rather go watch <i>Broadchurch </i>again."

It&#39;s a good price - just under $12,000. It gets about 28 mpg, so the gas savings should pay for about 1/4 of the monthly payment. Not too shabby.

I&#39;m not happy about having a car payment again, but whaddya gonna do? The public transit in this town sucks, and we live in the next town over from where I work and the kids go to school (and Manly works way up in the north county), so we&#39;re stuck needing two cars.

"event","So a couple of weeks ago, my doctor upped my antidepressant dosage, and suddenly - I feel <i>normal</i>. Catching a glimpse of the news is no longer like tossing a weighted shadow on my heart. I actually want to <i>do</i> things. I&#39;m making what I call &#39;daisy-chains&#39; in my head (little scraps of stories that I weave together as mental occupation. They don&#39;t really mean anything, but they help me stay creative) - I haven&#39;t done that, well, since Dad died, really.

I&#39;m also not completely exhausted, all the time anymore - so was that <i>all</i> the depression? Really? That explains a lot, I guess. Yay, science! ::shakes pill bottle::"

"event","Because of my Korean-television obsession, I&#39;ve kind of gotten interested in learning Korean - mostly, I admit, so I don&#39;t have to wait for subtitles. (And by the way, Korean is super-hard for English speakers, because it&#39;s a whole &#39;nuther alphabet and weird grammatical rules.) I&#39;ve been sloooowly but surely learning a bit at a time (will have to make flashcards for the alphabet, though, because it&#39;s just too different.)

The biggest help is, of course, watching television, because not only do I hear the natural pronunciation and usage, but it&#39;s constantly accompanied by subtitles which give me context. However, in starting to learn the alphabet, I&#39;ve discovered the whys of many things I wondered about. For example: some Korean words are alllllmost the same as their English counterparts. &quot;Coffee&quot; was pronounced &quot;Cup-pi&quot;, and &quot;Sofa&quot; was pronounced &quot;Sopa&quot;, while &quot;Dress&quot; was pronounced &quot;Dur-ess-eh&quot; and &quot;crayon&quot; as &quot;Kur-ay-ong&quot;. Why? Well, for starters, there&#39;s no &quot;F&quot; in Korean, so &#39;p&#39; is substituted, and Korean doesn&#39;t allow two consonants together - each syllable has to have a vowel and a consonant, so there&#39;s no way to say &quot;Dr&quot; in &quot;Dress&quot; (you have to add a vowel sound in there to make the complete syllable.) It was like a light bulb went on right over my head. Ohhhhhh, I get it.

Of course, what I really ought to be learning is Russian, because our library has a bazillion immigrants/visitors from Eastern Europe, and our Russian speaker on staff is nearing retirement age (I don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll do when she retires, because she speaks like six languages, and the rest of us are goobers who only speak one.) To my knowledge, we have no Korean patrons. The aforementioned Russian speakers, a couple of families from China, some from Vietnam, bunch of folks who speak Spanish, some Arabic speakers, and a smattering of French speakers...but none for the obscure language I&#39;m learning for kicks. ::throws up hands::"

This year, she was the only child of the three who visited (since grownup Little Tree works for a living, and Monkeyboy decided he&#39;d rather hang out at home unsupervised like a proper teenager). I talked to Peri last week, and said, &quot;So, you finally got to see what it&#39;s like to be the only child.&quot; She replied: &quot;Yeah. I <i>hate</i> it.&quot;

In the car saga, we&#39;re still looking. We did get financing from the credit union (and a really good rate), but we&#39;re still saying goodbye to our cable television so as to make up the payment. ::sigh:: At least we&#39;ll still have internet. We made a deal with our mechanic to take the dead car in trade for necessary repairs to my van, so that&#39;s a plus.

***
I decided that I was curious enough to try and learn Korean (mostly so I can watch their television without subtitles). Crap, that&#39;s a difficult language. I&#39;m picking up a bit from watching the dramas (I can now understand &quot;Who are you?&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re here!&quot;, &quot;Are you ok?&quot;, and &quot;It&#39;s delicious!&quot;), but the written language is something else again.

***

I&#39;ve also found myself completely invested in a romantic comedy (I <i>know</i>). I mean, invested to the point where I&#39;m re-watching episodes to pick up on metaphor and visual framing. All I can say is, it&#39;s a really good show. ::laugh:: On the other hand, I also found two other supernatural-themed shows, so rest assured I have not been replaced by a pod person.

One is complete - <a href=""http://dramafire.com/ghost-seeing-detective-cheo-yong-episode-1/"">Ghost-Seeing Detective Cheo Yong</a>. It&#39;s about - what else? - a police detective who can see ghosts. He uses his ability to solve crimes, and his department nickname is &#39;crazy ghost&#39;. He&#39;s helped by the ghost of a murdered teenager who hangs around the station. It&#39;s awesome, but alas, only 10 episodes long.

<lj-embed id=""61""/>

The other is currently-airing on Mon-Tues, and only has two episodes so far. It&#39;s a historical piece, set in ancient Korea, called &quot;<a href=""http://www.viki.com/tv/23594c-the-night-watchman"">The Night Watchman</a>. The first episode has a freaking <i>awesome</i> <b>DRAGON</b>. A dragon, people. Just bear with the bad wig of the bad guy, because dragon.

"event","So last weekend, we emptied out our storage unit - the rent for which had slowly crept up until it was untenable - and now our house is full of boxes. I suppose it&#39;s a good thing that our son had moved his room - since Little Tree moved out, she told her brother that he could move into her old room (which is the largest bedroom), and I was all excited because it meant I&#39;d get my sewing room back. But, no. Because his room was just about empty, it was the staging area for the storage unit stuff. So until I go through each and every box, and make extra room in the garage, I can&#39;t use the sewing room. Grrrr.

**

Went to see &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; yesterday - it was awesome. I laughed and whooped and cheered and had a <i>great</i> time. Can&#39;t wait to go see it again! :) That&#39;s what a superhero movie should be like - lots of laughs, lots of action, and a core of sincere hopefulness.

**
Yes, I&#39;m still binge-watching Korean shows, but I found a board where they understand me, so you won&#39;t have it inflicted on you quite so much here in my journal. :P&nbsp; Or, you know, y&#39;all could dip a toe in that pond so you could squee about it with me. I&#39;m just sayin&#39;.

***
I finally got in to see the doctor, and outlined all the bullshit I went through with her office. She was appalled - but I learned that her office recently joined a new medical group, and the couple of days that happened were the days when the office was transferring records. She did not offer that as an excuse, notably, and made sure that she gave me a three-month supply and called it in herself while I sat there. So I&#39;ll give her one more try. I really like the doctor because she&#39;s no-nonsense and to-the-point (as am I), it&#39;s just her staff that&#39;s the problem.

So she decided to up my antidepressant dosage, and suddenly, I&#39;m feeling much less anxious and much more like myself - that&#39;s just after a week, so I&#39;m hopeful that I&#39;ll feel completely normal in another week or two.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like having to be dependent on this chemical shit, but at least I can function properly now. The only down side? The sexual side effects (because not being depressed &amp; anxious means my sex drive is getting back to normal, but this medication apparently interferes with the ability to achieve orgasm. I <i>wish</i> I was kidding.)&nbsp; What the hell, medicine? Is this some kind of joke?&nbsp; GAH."

2. &quot;World of Trouble&quot; was awesome. I love the universe Winters has developed, and I ::triple heart:: his main character. Hank Palace is currently nestling in my heart next to Columbo, Quincy, and Kolchak. I mean, who can ask for more than a man who loves his family and keeps doing his job even in the face of the apocalypse? I assume that this book was the last one in the series, which is sad, but I&#39;ll definitely keep an eye out for Ben Winters&#39; next book.

3. Picked up another currently-airing Korean drama - <a href=""http://www.viki.com/tv/23905c-marriage-not-dating?q=marriage%20not"">Marriage, Not Dating</a> a romantic comedy which is light and funny, even if it has a lot of second-hand embarrassment. It&#39;s told in a weird flashback way - the episodes start with a snapshot of a confrontation or complication, and the rest of the episode is what led up to it. In a nutshell: the two main leads pretend to be dating so that the male lead&#39;s mother will get off his back (he just wants to live alone, by himself, and not be bothered). In return, the female lead will get to needle her obnoxious, horndog ex-boyfriend who dumped her. So...yeah, a bit ridiculous. But unlike a lot of other rom-coms, while it touches on heavy stuff, it doesn&#39;t suddenly go from cute to <i>tragic</i>. What I like about this one is that the complications aren&#39;t a series of soap-opera plots, but real stuff - quietly dysfunctional families, complicated relationships with your ex, emotional baggage which prompts you to make bad decisions, etc.

I got hooked when the female lead gets roped into helping with the memorial dinner for the male lead&#39;s grandfather (a yearly observance for the dead), and gets all the work dumped on her by the family (remember: she&#39;s not really dating him). At the end of the evening, she gets treated spectacularly badly by the family, and has a confidence spilled by the male lead, whereupon she <i>snaps</i>, grabs a salted fish off the memorial table and starts beating him with it, screaming &quot;Do you know how hard I worked today?!?&quot;

4. In more Adventures in Korean cuisine, I&#39;m going to try making JaJang Tteokbokki (rice cakes with black bean paste, onions, and cabbage.) Black beans are good, cabbage is good...I guess we&#39;ll see. Photos to follow. :)"

A scammer scared the bejeebers out of Monkeyboy last week while he was home alone.

After a month of waiting for a test, we have a diagnosis for Little Tree&#39;s worrying health issues, and it&#39;s the &#39;annoying&#39; option instead of the scary one. Whew.

All of these things are upsetting and I don&#39;t want to talk about them. Let&#39;s talk about fannish stuff instead.

***
<b>Recent Books I&#39;ve Read:</b>

&quot;<i>The Psychopath Whisperer</i>&quot; - this was written by a psychologist who specializes in this field. Very interesting, and very scary. Lots of information about how the brains of psychopaths physically differ from everyone else&#39;s.

&quot;<i>The Girl With All the Gifts</i>&quot; by Mike Carey - Wow. This zombie novel was <i>amazing</i>. Sweet, scary, disturbing, and really left the reader thinking deeply about human nature. The zombie mechanism - a fungus - was <i>really</i> well-thought-out, which I appreciated.

&quot;<i>World of Trouble</i>&quot; by Ben Winters - The last book (?) in his &quot;Last Policeman&quot; series, this follows Our Hero Hank Palace as he leaves on a trip to find his missing sister and determine whether she was right or she was snookered by her friends...in the last few weeks before the asteroid hits. Like the other books, the thread of the central mystery is wound around examinations of people&#39;s response to calamity, and how Hank&#39;s essential nature continues to assert itself. He&#39;s a stand-in for the reader in this way, showing us that apocalypse pares us all down to essentials. I highly recommend this entire series.

Recent books I&#39;ve not read because the publishers are assholes (<i>Not scientifically proven)</i>:

&quot;<i>Foxglove Summer</i>&quot; by Ben Aaronovitch - This was supposed to be out next month. Got a notice that its release date has been moved to <i>January</i>. ::narrows eyes::


************************
<b>Recent shows I&#39;m Watching:</b>

<a href=""http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4448/You_Are_All_Surrounded/"">&quot;You&#39;re All Surrounded&quot;</a> - Just-finished Korean cop show about four rookies who are assigned to a serious crimes squad in the Gangnam district of Seoul. The lead is a young man whose mother was murdered when he was 15, and he became a cop to try and solve her murder. Billed as a comedy (? Really?); there&#39;s a fair amount of humor, but it&#39;s really there as leavening for the more serious themes. Great ending that really wraps everything up.

<a href=""http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4307/Two_Weeks/"">&quot;<i>Two Weeks</i>&quot;</a> - About a wastrel who gets framed for murder. This is complicated by the fact that he has a daughter he never knew about, she&#39;s dying of leukemia, and he&#39;s the match for her transplant. He has two weeks to prove his innocence and keep the gangsters who framed him from finishing him off so he can save her life. Oh, and the investigating detective? His ex-girlfriend&#39;s new fiancee. Murder, double-crosses, explosions, tears, undercover investigators, gangsters, political backstabbing, etc. Really gripping stuff.

<a href=""http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4476/The_Joseon_Gunman/"">&quot;Joseon Gunman&quot;</a> - Set in the late 1800&#39;s (ish) in Korea, this is about a swordsman whose family gets falsely accused of treason - he takes up the gun to avenge his family. What can I say? Period clothing, lots of beautiful (though highly improbable) scenes of good-looking heroes whirling around and riding horses while shooting Enfield rifles. ::fans self::

<a href=""http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4494/Trot_Lovers/"">&quot;Trot Lovers&quot;</a> - Ok, I hesitated to mention this one, because I know you&#39;re all going to make fun of me. Go ahead, get it out of your systems, I&#39;ll wait. So, the setup. &quot;Trot&quot; is a musical style - lowbrow, made fun of, but it makes people happy. I&#39;ve been thinking of it as the disco of Korea (if you&#39;re my age, though, you&#39;ll actually kind of recognize the style, because you heard it in a a lot of Asian restaurants a few decades back). To sum up, this series is about a young woman who becomes a singer and starts a Trot revival - not enough? Ok, it&#39;s about a young woman whose late mother was a Trot singer. Her father gets deep in debt to some loan sharks, loses the family store, and takes off on the run, leaving her with her little sister to care for. She runs afoul of a conceited singer who deliberately gets her fired. Long story short, she winds up with a rookie musical contract and the conceited jerk as her manager. It&#39;s a lot of fun, and the lead actress is adorable. (Whatever, don&#39;t judge me.)

<b>Upcoming shows I&#39;m looking forward to:</b>

&quot;<i>Doctor Who</i>&quot; - Nuff said. (BBCAM) 8/23

&quot;<i>Intruders</i>&quot; - John Simm, body-stealing, violence, scariness. I am all over this bad boy. Same start date as DW. (BBCAM) 8/23

&quot;<i>Hell on Wheels</i>&quot; - the next season of this Western. (AMC) 8/2

&quot;<i>The Night Watchman</i>&quot; - a soon-to-be-airing Korean historical drama about a prince who can see ghosts. Airing August 4 (which means that you&#39;ll be able to watch it Aug 5, unless you speak Korean, as the English subs won&#39;t be up til the next day.)"

"event","In further Korean television adventures, tonight we're making Korean food that we've seen people eating in dramas (because it makes us hungry). Specifically, spicy pork and Bulgogi (marinated beef barbeque wraps). Little Tree is also bringing a Korean melon for us to try. 

We've located Soju (Korean vodka? I guess we'll find out), banana milk (Korea's answer to chocolate milk, I think), and a cool little double-sided grilling basket for the meat. Shopping at the local Korean market was amusing (in that I actually recognized some words when the clerk was on the phone) and easier than the Vietnamese market, in that the Korean packages had quite a lot of English on their labels (unlike the Vietnamese packages, where I just have to kind of guess what's in it or suck it up and ask the clerks). Also, educational, as in ""What would sweet-and-spicy dried squid shreds be used for?"" or ""I wonder what black bean paste tastes like?"" 

Manly and I spent some time this morning watching a show called ""The Kimchi Chronicles"", about a woman of Korean descent who discovered her cuisine and did a cooking show about it with her chef husband and Hugh Jackman and his wife. (Idek. But the food looked tasty.)

ETA: HOLY COW I LOVE BULGOGI. It was soooo tasty, and I made side dishes of garlic spinach, ginger carrots, and quick-pickled sweet peppers. So damn good. Little Tree and her GF came over with two of their friends, and we all ate together - it was awesome. Soju smells like rubbing alcohol but is a little less harsh than vodka. Manly made mojitos with it. The boys drank banana milk and liked it. We'll make this much more often. :)"

"event","So I put in for my medication refill last week. On Friday, the pharmacy still hadn't called me, so I went by to pick them up...only to find that the doctor's office had <i>denied</i> all of them because ""she wants you to come in for a visit"" (neither the office nor the pharmacy thought that news important enough to bother me with). So I spent the whole weekend - Friday, Sat, Sun, and today - out of medicine. Thankfully I had a bit of old prescription blood pressure pills, so I didn't stroke out, but I don't have any antidepressants, and while I felt ok this weekend, this morning I have a tight knot of anxiety in my chest, and I can't read the (frankly depressing to begin with) news, and ugh, I don't feel well. 

The doctor's office also acted like total ditzes when I called (""oh, don't you have an appointment coming up?""/""NO, SINCE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME TO MAKE ONE."") It does not inspire confidence. And they damn well better have called in a refill, because I am now completely OUT of blood pressure medicine. ETA: No, as of 5 pm (when the doctor's office closes) they STILL hadn't called in my medicine. So I have no goddam blood pressure medicine for tomorrow. Before I started my current prescription, my <i>medicated</i> bp was hovering around 175/100. <i>And this is not helping.</i> (Also, I'm also light-headed from the antidepressant withdrawal, in addition to the damn anxiety attack - both of which are right on schedule since I haven't had any in 4 days, and it says right on the damn bottle that you can't just stop taking this stuff.)

Also, today is my mother's birthday, and I just got a notice that the gift I ordered for her hasn't even fucking <i>shipped</i>. 

If you need me, I'm going to be crying in the corner like a little bitch. ::sigh::"

It&#39;s a bit reminiscent of &#39;Rock &#39;n Roll High School&#39;, but more gut-punch-ish and violent. And with prettier band members (sorry, Ramones! Y&#39;all were cool and crazy talented, but not so much with the pretty.) It&#39;s about a high school band called &quot;Eye Candy&quot; who are bffs 4-ever and who wander around high school looking so cool you could cut yourself on them. The lead singer is one of those crazy, skinny boys who wears guyliner like a BOSS and whose coolness makes girls&#39; panties fly right the hell off but who you know will hit a wall at about 35 and spend the rest of his life unemployed and mooching off his friends. Then there&#39;s his bestest bestie who is the best friend ever, the bass player and keyboardist who have a twin-brother-bromance going on (one looks about 11 and the other is the &#39;womanizer&#39;), the taciturn drummer with flowing locks, and the &#39;still waters run deep&#39; guitarist who never smiles. They get transferred to a rich-kid school and wind up in epic showdowns against the pretty-rich-boy band at the school.

The music is pretty good - there&#39;s much less stupid wailing love ballad soundtrack and more garage rock - and the song they first sing reminded me a bit of Echo and the Bunnymen. Given that the lead singer for the band looks like this (zebra-print shirt in first photo):

I finished watching &quot;<i>Who Are You?</i>&quot; on Hulu (South Korean show about a detective who wakes up from a coma and can see spirits.) It had a season-long, involved arc (always a plus for me!), and even if it sometimes got romance in my spooky detecting, I enjoyed it. Lots of plot twists and a few spooky ghosts. I found it interesting that the romance is very g-rated - lots of smiles and hand-holding and meaningful looks and hugs and only a couple of (fairly chaste) kisses.

Also, there&#39;s a Shaman who can see and hear ghosts, and who is very focused on her business. When a ghost comes to her and asks her to help him, she says &quot;And what are you going to do for me? There&#39;s nothing free, in this world <i>or</i> the next.&quot;&nbsp; ::snerk::

"event","So - my shows are ending, or going on hiatus or not getting renewed after getting screwed over (gee, thanks, Fox. ::mutters:: <i>Assholes</i>.)

So I&#39;ve had a South Korean TV show on my Netflix queue for a while, and decided to give it a whirl. It&#39;s called &quot;Vampire Prosecutor&quot;, and it&#39;s mighty fine vampire-cop cheese. You know what a sucker I am for these sorts of supernatural hijinks + cop drama, so this is right up my street.
<p>Since Saturday, I&#39;ve binge-watched all of Season 2 (Netflix doesn&#39;t have S1 up, so I&#39;ll have to find it elsewhere). The format is so familiar to me - wacky team of investigators, led by pretty-boy vampire Min Tae Yeon, his sidekick the pudgy and loveable - but still competent - best friend detective who&#39;s in on the vampire secret, Hwang Soon Bum, the plucky and beautiful female detective trying to make it in the male-dominated force, Yoo Jong In, the part-time technical contractor - read &#39;detective constable&#39; - who gets stuck with all the crap work and who hopes to get hired full time, Choi Dong Man, and the older, more dignified pathologist who sometimes cracks wise, Jo Jung Eun. Sound familiar? It should. They even have an evil vampire, whose name is only given as &quot;L&quot;, played by the prettiest boy in a pretty cast (seriously. In skinny-leg jeans and Doc Martins and guyliner. Whoa. So pretty.)
Exhibit A:
<img alt=""Vampire prosecutor still"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/harmonyfb/719025/73721/73721_original.jpg"" title=""Vampire prosecutor still"" /></p><p>Exhibit B:</p><p><img alt=""Vampire prosecutor still 2"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/harmonyfb/719025/74184/74184_original.jpg"" title=""Vampire prosecutor still 2"" />

Some of the translations are a riot. There&#39;s a scene where the young cop, who&#39;s been bragging about his car, has to drive the team. They arrive at his POS, with its mirrors duct-taped on, and the woman cop says &quot;I thought you said your car was<i> the bomb</i>.&quot; Defensively, he replies: &quot;It is. It can kill people.&quot; snerk.

So today, as I&#39;m looking for someplace to watch the first season (and hoping there&#39;s a third), I get a &#39;recommended for you&#39;...another Korean series called &quot;Who Are You?&quot;, about a cop who wakes up from a coma able to see spirits...and her partner, who is only interested in hard facts and proven science. (Sound familiar?) It&#39;s pretty darn good, too - more spooky and less cheesy (though &#39;Vampire Prosecutor&#39; is pretty damn gory and violent along w/the cheese. This one, less so.) The translation isn&#39;t quite as up on American colloquialisms as VP, but it&#39;s still good - you can watch it for free on Hulu.

Who knew I&#39;d like Korean supernatural cop dramas. Bring it on! (Also, I&#39;m learning a lot about South Korea. And its language conventions. Also, I can say &quot;yes&quot; in Korean, which is 100% more Korean words than I knew last week. ::thumbs up::)</p>"

<lj-cut text=""Spoilery talk"">I mean, seriously: <i>Skye</i>? I've been hoping against hope that that the ""true feelings"" being hinted at for Ward were something transgressive. Hell, make him yearn for Fitz! Or even Simmons! Or Coulson! Give us something interesting and unusual and <i>non-creepy</i>. Because, scriptwriters, having the authority figure macking on the <i>kid</i> he's training? That is creepy as hell. Hel-lo, patriarchy. (Unless he's doing it so he can kidnap Skye, which...even creepier, y'all.)

And then? He turns out to be Hydra? Ok, I knew something was hinky, but I did NOT see that coming. I did love that Hand turned out to be a hard-ass bitch AND steadfastly loyal. By the way, my husband called it when Paxton showed up originally. <i>Too big a name</i>, he said, <i>must be the bad guy</i>. Heh.

I loved the little touches - Coulson's total confusion and heartbreak over his friend. Fitz crying but still defiant. I loved that this was just a coda to the anarchy happening elsewhere. I can't wait to see where they go in an effort to 'survive'.

I hate the ridiculous amounts of time, energy, and money spent on it by people who really do have better things to do (like...the media. Why should they engage in investigative journalism to aid the public good when they can spend hours talking about a meaningless game?)

But I can't pretend that social good is the reason. 

When I was a kid, every weekend and every major holiday, my father commandeered the only television, and played football games (as loud as possible) for hours and hours and hours. And hours. The sound of football games, that horrific wave of never-ceasing sound overlaid with color commentators shouting to be heard over the white noise that scratched continuously at my cerebellum, played at 'hi-I'm-going-deaf-but-won't-admit-it' levels, while slow resentment built up in my heart.

I swore to myself (on every single occasion), that I would NEVER permit football to be screened in my home when I was an adult. The first Sunday I didn't have to endure that twitch-inducing din was so happy that the memory of it seems like a special birthday memory. I was free, and I'd never have to listen to it EVER AGAIN.

It is a measure of the love I have for my husband that I say nothing when he watches it. (The measure of his love is that he set up a second TV in his workshop so it's not inflicted on me every week.)

""Silver Foil"" (disco ball!)
""Metallurgy"" (tarnished brass with green)

Out of these, my favorite is ""Blood Red"". On me it was a dark red with brown tones. Very wearable, and I turned around and ordered a whole tube of it (along with samples of ""Undead Red"" and their ""Darkly Sparkly"" eyeshadow.) I also loved their black, because it had decent coverage without looking too matte (I'll probably order a tube of it later). ""Indigo Bridge"" was very pretty, with a nice vivid color, though it's a little less versatile. ""Silver Foil"" is useless as a stand-alone lipstick because it was so so sheer, but it's <i>perfect </i>for giving a bit of shine to other colors. ""Metallurgy"" looked godawful on me. 

One of my friends then linked me to a blogger who reviews beauty products - she has a review of the Portland Black Lipstick Company (complete with good photos!), but she also applies actual science and math to makeup - including figuring cost per ounce, examining value of 'special buy' sets, etc. I'm not a big makeup person, but I thought her blog was very interesting. Here's her review of the lipstick company: <a href=""http://www.brightestbulbinthebox.com/2013/10/review-portland-black-lipstick-company.html"">The Brightest Bulb in the Box</a>

Next, I guess I'll try some eyeshadow (I am on the fence about it. I like the way it looks on other people, but I wear glasses, so it's not terribly visible on me to begin with....) Any suggestions, y'all?"

"event","We finished watching the second season of <i>Ripper Street</i>. All I can say is <lj-spoiler title=""Spoilers!"">I <i>knew</i> Detective Constable Flight was really Remorseful Hal. And <i>clearly</i>, Insp. Shine is also a vampire - an Old One, based on his hubris. Oh, the plot bunnies. </lj-spoiler>

In a nonspoilery way, I can also say...Insp. Reed has some of the worst judgment in his personal life (really? You're gonna do <i>that</i>, Reed? ::throws up hands::) And Jackson/Susan is in my top five favorite dysfunctional married couples (though it doesn't hold a candle to Stumpy and Rita Sue from <i>Carnivale</i>.) And Sgt. Drake! You go, dude! Let your inner <i><i>Better Man</i></i> flower! 

So...please tell me there's a third season coming."

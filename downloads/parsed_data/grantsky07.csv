"event","for those of you who dont already know....i wrecked my car monday, i was rounding the turn by ritas kitchen headed towards evans going 35 ...yes i was ""really"" going 35, my left rear tire was low on air, got loose, slid right, then back to the left, then all the way around and into a bank, doing major front end damage to the car, and bringing out both air bags....it has been heavily depated on whether or not the car will be totalled, but after long discussion with the auto knowledgeable father i have been assured the car will not be totalled and will be back into commission eventually...for the meantime, the all powerful panzer ""1988 nissan pathfinder, 2 doors, 1 doorhandle, 1 tail light, all bad A"" has been brought out to transport me and other necissary goods...do not fret my friends, the carwill be repaired, possibly in less than a month, and will be recommissioned for service....

""ladies and gentlemen we can rebuilt it, we have the technology,....faster, stronger, better."""

"event","<em><font size=""4"">im at a point in my life where i begin to question things, dont we all reach that point on occassion?<br /><br />ex 1: michelle tells me she has a dream i died in a plane crash, the day before we leave for LA<br /><br />ex 2: enter LA unscathed, leave with a strange confused look upon my face, wondering if Anne Frank was truly wrong when she said there is ""good in all people"", or if maybe, they werent people at all..<br /><br />ex 3: sitting on the tram to leave disneyland, ""the happiest place on earth"" watch someone come within inches of death, falling off a moving tran onto the pavement, i found myself directing traffic 30 seconds later.<br /><br />ex 4:&nbsp;walking back to the bus, seton and I notice that thousands of guests are being detoured by this ""inconvenience"" as the californians called it, to walk along the road, then hundereds of cars were backed up because of this.<br /><br />ex 5: return home, find one of my dear friends in pain, give them empathy and wisdom from past experiences about a faulty and tattered relationship, she tells her boyfriend, argument ensues.<br /><br />ex 6: Mrs Brown's research paper, i attempted to do a well written, simple paper with as few errors as possible...i recieve the worst possible grade a 50 out of 100....<br /><br />after&nbsp;confronting these queries with my concience, God, and what slight amount of intelligence i have, i found another question as an answer for ex 5-6, Is it all worth it? Do my efforts matter, and if so, when will i see response and reap benefits? my answer lies in ex 1-4........yes..it is all worth it, the woman who fell off the tran affected thousands of guests in one hour....imagine what we can do in a life...in the entire 5 day span i was in los angeles, the city of angels, at no point did i think of confronting these people, they were possibly the most poorly mannered people i have met, and yet i can help but ponder the possibilities, for those who are lost are always looking for the path...if los angeles were the city of angles, imagine the walk back to the bus that night.....imagine thousands exiting disney world, praying for the woman who was injured, the singing praises all the way to their cars thanking him for safety in their travels....imagine if the woman with the two boys who was complaining over a 5 minute walk after a 10 hour walk around an amusement park instead was compelled to stay with the caretakers and suport them, .......imagine if we were the same, imagine if every eff you, GD, sh**, DA, B*tch, were instead, god bless you, have a great day, praise God, God loves you, comin to church tonight? etc......the people at the drug assembly today reminded me of todays church....walk in, praise God, walk out, praise gods....<br /><br />It will all be worth it in the end.</font></em>"

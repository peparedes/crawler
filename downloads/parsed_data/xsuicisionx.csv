Knowing Ill Regret Tomorrow
Sitting On The Beach
In The Middle On Night
Surrounded By What I Dont Know
And Every One Elses Problems
And Fearing Missing That Chance
Its A Long Walk Home
With These Thoughts In My Head
My Plan Was To Leave Them There
Let Some One Else Ponder Away
Ill Come Back When They Have Been Answered
The Questions Roaming In My Head
They Keep Me Up In Sweat 
Make Me Stumble In At Three
All Just To Come Back 
When I Look In Your Eyes"

My Gun Sings Of Beauty Untold These Days
When Love Is Lost In A Blink Of An Eye
Staring Down The Barrel Of Your Heart
Taking A Chance And Pulling On Your Feelings
Hearing The Click The First Time We Met
Since Then My Life Just Hasnt Been The Same
Ending The Pain This Time And Seeing The Muzzle Blast"

This Sunday Im Getting The Animal Tattoo Becuz Last Sunday It Just Didnt Work Gothic Tattoos Is Closed On Sunday So We Tried Chameleon And I Also Tried Calling Ashley Again But I Deleted Her The Last Digit Of He Number From Nicks Cell Phone Sorry I Didnt Mean To So Im Going To Get In Touch With Her Again Bout It I Have To In Next Thursday And See If The Drawing They Are Going To Make Is What I Want Maybe Change It A Little And Then Sunday Go In At Two And Get It Inked On Me Its Going To Be Cool And Big Ima Love It 

Getting My Mowhawk Soon Though I Have Said That Enough But Im Not Sure If Im Going To Prom Becuz I Dont Think Ill Have Enough Money Unless I Beg Some From My Mother And If I Do I Need My Suit Soon And Also Rent A Car Or Whatever We Are Getting Also I Dont Know Much Bout It But I Knw Jima Will Get Pissed If I Dont Go And I Dont Want That I Do Want To Go But It Feels Like So Much Shit Is Going On Right Now Even Though I Know Myself It Isnt But I Dont Know

18 Days To Drunken Gun Fights In The Middle Of The Woods On Absynthe
22 Till The Prom Man Is That Anough Time For A Suit And Limo Guess We Shall Find Out In Time
27 Till A Fun Ass Time Recovering From Camping For A Week

Still Been Hiding From Shit 
Not Telling Any One 
Procrastinating From Every Thing I Have To Do 
Though Its Holding Me Back 
Its Easier To Deal With Not Change 
Then To Find Out What Would Happen
Sitting Lonley For How Many Years Now
I Am Getting So Sick Of My Friends Saying Their Lonely
Though Wondering Why Its Taken This Long
Most People Say Being Single Is A Battle
Its Utopia When Your Awake
Your Lonely Before You Fall Alseep
It Started That Way But Man That Was Long Ago
Lonely Was What I Was A Year Ago
But Its Grown Not Living In The Moment
And The Dreams I Have You Should See Them
Now Thats Utopia Pondering Them Is Heaven
But Every One Has Their Own Problem 
And I Have To Become One Thats Why I Havent Said Much
But Its Gone On To Long
I Guess Ill End This With A Famous Quote

6.Pay More Attention To My Friends I Dont Know How I Was In The Past But A FriendShip Is What You Make It
7.Be More Open To New Shit( Hate New Shit)
8.Continue To Stop Drinking Tonic

Yeah So This Doesnt Really Mean Anything Unless I Try And I Am So This Is Good But I Dont Know Why I Am Saying It Here Instead Of In My Head All Day But I Want A Change Becuz This Life Isnt Working Out As Of Right Now But Enough With The Sad Shit Im Getting Sick Of It 

I Saw Jr Today Along With Elliot Kevin And Tommy It Was Cool I Havent Seen Jr In A Long Time And We Got To Talk Which Is Good I Also Made It Up In My Mind That If I Dont Like Something I Should Stop Pussyfooting Around The Idea Of It Will Go Away In Thime And Just Tell The People That Are Doing Said Things That They Piss Me Off And I Am Going To Do That But Not Blow Up On Them But Just Tell Them Or Let Them Atleast Know Shits Pissing Me Off( Wow This Is A Long Post) 


I Guess This Friday Me Elliot And Jr Are Going To Tip A Few Back Believe It Or Not We Like Only Drank Together Like Once I Have KNow Them For Like A Combined Of 28 Years Between The Two Thats Crazy It Will Be A Good Time And We Will Talk Which We At The Least Help Me But Its Always Good Hanging Out Witht Those Fuckers

Oh Yeah I Put Up A Wall Im My Back Room So There Is A Small Wall In The Laundry Part Of The Back Room I Think We Didnt Need A Wall There But My Mom Asked So I Said Why The Fuck Not And We Will Have A Wall From The Kitchen To The Back Room Where The Hole In The Wall Is I Still Have To Finish The Bathroom But I Am Waiting On Paul To Cut The Door So I Will Be a Bigger Frame Which I Dont Want Him To Do Becuz My Bathroom Is So Kick Ass With A Small Door I think Im Just Going To Get Some Work Done So I Can Keep It That Way

Line: 
As Empty As My Soul Shattered As It Goes

Poem:
I Still Desire For Your Touch On The Coldest Day
Sitting Buy The Fire And Watching The Snow Fall
Never Seeing Those Eyes I Only Dream About
Or To See The Snow Fall Upon Your Eyelashes
Nor Tasting Those Cherry Lips That I Have Thought About
Comfy And Supple With Every Kiss
Missing The Smell Of Your Hair Without Getting That Pleasure
To Even Run My Hands Through Them
Or To Graze Upon Your Soft Soothing Skin
To Spend A Night Talking All Night
Getting To Know Everything You Like
And The Things You Hate Will Melt Away
To Sleep Tonight And See You Again
Would Be To Much I Dont Think I Could Sleep"

"event","<P>My friends are the <EM>greatest</EM> things that have ever happened. Seriously. There cooler than your friends, I <STRONG>promise</STRONG> you. They listen to me whenever I talk about anything, stupid shit. All the time. It can be about boys, the awesome outfit im wearing tomorrow, how much I hate that bitch, how fucking awesome I think I am, how fucking not awesome I think someone else is, anything. They promise to fuck bitches up with me, and they reassure me that I have nothing to worry about. They make me feel good about myself, and not in a fake way. None of my friends are fake. Girls AND guys. They both listen to me whine about whatever, or brag about something really great. If they think im doing something really stupid I shouldnt do, they put me in check. They tell me to chill the fuck out, or that I should keep my mouth shut for once. They love me for me. They love me when I cry about stupid guys who make me feel like shit, they love me when I make really stupid faces at taco bell, they love me when I watch salad fingers, they love me when I spill milkshakes all over the place, they love me when I promise to fucksomewhoresup, they love me when I reassure them that they are the best people ever, they love me when&nbsp;I cant stop singing the bannana phone song, they love me when I yell at them in the middle of the hallway for absolutely nothing, they love me for making an ass out of myself,&nbsp;they love me when I yell at them for doing&nbsp;drugs, they love me for being the biggest Democrat you'll ever meet,&nbsp;they love me when I cant stop talking about politics because they hate them but im so passionate about them, they even love me when I ramble on about nothing important. And that is why I love them. But it IS important. If I didnt have my friends in my life, I wouldnt be. I simply wouldnt. That sounds incredibly stupid and unrealistic but I would be a completly different person. All my friends add to me and help me keep my sanity, or lack thereof. They give me compliments when I need them the most. Im always there for them, whenever they need me. I know im a selfish person, but if my friend needs me to go to the mall at 3, even though I might be doing&nbsp; something else,&nbsp;because she knows that HE will be there, ill go for her. If they dont want to go to the bathroom by themselves but were in the middle of a movie, ill get up and go. Id expect them to do the same for me. I love them to death, honestly. Some of them are really quirky, some of them can be real bitches. Some of them are more quiet than others, some couldnt shut up if you begged them to, some try to be sweet when you ask them a question, others will tell you in the rudest way possible, all my friends are hilarious, some have a dry sense of humor, others have a dumb sense of humor. Some of them, god forbid, are republicans. I even love them. Some of them absolutely hate to read, some of them are really stupid. Others, are very intelligent and wise. You all know who you are. I adore you guys. Thats why im writing this very long entry dedicated to you. Just rereading this is making me ludicriously happy. I started writing this because I was thinking of something, and happened to be listening to a very emotional song for me, and I started feeling really bad. I felt like no one liked me, and by no one I meant no guy. I felt like no GUY liked me, and I was about to cry. For some reason I thought about my friends, and how they would cheer me up if they were here. Then I started thinking about all the plans I had for the nearby future, Staying the night and Battle Of The Bands with my darling Jessica, Going shopping sometime with my lovely Kayla, doing ANYTHING and taking pictures with Sara, Doing something with Sean i dont even know what, and just seeing all my great friends in school tomorrow. It made me feel great. I actually didnt even feel bad anymore, even though nothing had really changed in my situation. I feel so...great. I really cant think of any other words, great keeps coming to mind. Because thats what all my friends are. As long as ive got all my fucking awesome friends, ill be fine. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I love you all, with every little ounce of strength that I contain.</P>
<P>Sincerely Yours,</P>
<P>Me.</P>"

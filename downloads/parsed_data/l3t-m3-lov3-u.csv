<P><FONT size=2>This last week has been really hard and confuzing for me, and really, i dont know how much more of this i can take. Ive been reading through all my livejournal enterys and i noticed.. i used to be so much more carefree. My mood was usually always good. I mean Duh, it wasnt good all of the time, but for the most part. Now my mood has been sad, depressed, or something else along those lines. Im so sick of it all. I always wanted to grow up...and now that i am getting older i realized that it pretty much sucks. It went from everything being so perfect to this. Its like..all these problems just hit me at once.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Garrett and me are ""friends""....honestly i hate it. Like sometimes i feel like i would rather just not talk to him ever again. Its so hard talking to him now. Its like teasing me becaause i know that thats all we will probally ever be again, and i miss what we had. He told me tonight that i was ""one of the biggest problems in his life"" wtf is that? I told him that if he didnt want me in his life,then it was his choice and i would not talk to him anymore and stuff (which i dont think is what i want but...) even though its not like im always calling him and stuff like that...i actually never call him. he always calls to talk to me. When i asked him why i was his problem he told me that he expected me to change after we broke up...and i didnt. He wouldnt tell me how he expected me to change though. He said i was just supposed to. But im not gonna change for him or anyother guy. Even i know that theres plenty of guys that like me how i am...so i dont need to change for anyone. Its just so hard...I guesse it feels like i would be abel to do something about it if i knew what it was. Its so frustrating. I need to get him out of my mind, but i dont know if i can. If ill have the strenght to tell him that i dont want to talk to him anymore, not because of him, just because it hurts so fucking bad. This sucks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>It used to be that when i needed to get away from all the drama, i would go home, but now...home is the worste part of my problems. Melissa got in trouble again and somehow once again im getting put in the middle of it. My parents threaten me with my life if i do certian things for her, but i dont want to tell her no and her get mad at me. She's my sister and best friend, so as much as ii want to help her with everything...i want whats best for her...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>idk...i guess i need to just stop looking back at what things used to be, and start realizing and trying to cope with what it is.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>anyways...i have so much more shit to whine about but. really whts the point?....im goin to watch Laguna Beach &amp;hearts;</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>yeah. so me and Garrett just broke up. hes all like we dont see eachother enough so we should just be friends(which is bullshit because who did i spend practically my sholle weekend with? HIM) and hes like im not saying that just to say it. i really want to be really close friends with you still...but the thing is..after everything that happened last night, ill never be able to be ""just friends"". hes the most amazing guy i have ever met and it hurts knowing that hes not mine anymore, and that we will have to be ""just friends"". i know that its almost impossible to be friends with someone that you still have feelings for...because everytime you see...or talk to them it hurts too bad.. and i guesse this sounds kinda lame becaus weve only been together for a couple months, but..ive never been so close to a person before. it felt like ive known him forever...hes all i ever think about.. it really feels like some one took away a part of me...</P>
<P>having him made me realize how much i HATE being single. that i need some one there, to hold me, to hug me, and to love me.</P>
<P>i hadda talk to someone about all this..no ones online...and its too late to call Carissa or Sara..theres no one to cry to now...so i just poured my heart on on here...yeah. its stupid..and i probally sound stupid...but whatever, it doesnt even matter anymore.</P>
<P>...i guesse im just not good enough for him = (</P>"

<P>yeah....so friday night.. me, sara, and melissa went to the Booker southeast game. i finally got to see Garrett&lt;3...but yeah. that didnt go so good. He fucking hugged everysingle girl that passed him..while i was standing riight there. it made me soo mad...but i trust him so i just let it go..then he asked me what was a matter right before we left and i gave him a ""half ass hug"" and i just said nothing...it wasnt a big deal..this tmie i was gonna drop it. so then i get home and he calls me and is like yelling at me for not telling him what was a matter with me. so i told him and he got even more mad at me. i mean i saw Junior and the boyz, matt and devin, parker...all the boys that i love more then anything..but i didnt stand there and hang on them right in front on me. so we got in a big fight...broke up...then like got back together...and fought some more. after a while i was so frustraded;mad;sad;upset...that i threw the phone at sara..so she would take to him while i cried. then he was telling sara that i was stupid cuz only little kids cry...then sara made him feel bad about saying it and he was al like no, i mean shes too good for that...but its lik what the fuck am i supposed to do? idk...this shyt is all so confuzing....but i think we got it all worked out...actually....i think <STRONG><U>sara </U></STRONG>worked every thing out.

<P>Thursday we went on the rertreat. It was&nbsp;<U>amazing.</U> in my dorm i had Ande, JessicaP,JessicaR,Kate,Leah,Christina and Alex...<STRONG>soooo </STRONG>many laughs....<STRONG>soooo</STRONG> much fun! I love you gurlies! Thursday night at the Night Session everyone cried and yeah...it was sad. I dont know if ive ever cried so hard in my <STRONG>whole</STRONG> life. Mrs. Ditchfeild was the speaker for both session and she was <EM>REALLY</EM> good. Her message <STRONG><EM><U>changed</U></EM></STRONG> my life. </P>
<P>Friday i went to the movies with Roach,Sara,Emily,Kayla,Breanne,Megan,Dara,Tim,Tommy,Zach,Ryan,and Hunter. WOW...good times,We saw Mr and Mrs Smith (dumb movie...lol we got stuck seeing it cuz thats what all the guys wanted to see) after the movie we all got ice cream and then my mom picked me and sara and Roach up and took us to Saras. Awww...Saras dog had puppies like last week and there soo cute! we played with them for lik 2 hours and then we messed around and took a couple of pics (ill post some tomarrow) and then we watched every single episode of Andy milonakis and memorized the theme song rap hahahaha...that is my FAVORIET show! </P>
<P>Today i hadda wake up soo early cuz my mom hadda pick me up a 9. I went to my sisters soccer game and then came home at like 12 30 ..and went to sleep! i was so tierd....2 whole nights of no sleep lol. i slept till like 3 and then Garret called and asked if him and LaReese could come over on there break...so they came and we hung out and they made fun of me cuz i looked like a mess cuz i just woke up...and they laughed lol. lol he told me from now on he was calling me ugly girl...lol and then he called me that the rest of the time he was there so when he left i didnt give him a big hug like i usually do...so he said come here beautiful...lol so now thats what he calls me...He is amazing...i have never liked someone so much.</P>
<P>Guys are really staring to get stupid. all they cause is <U>drama </U>and <U>pain.</U>&nbsp; Roach and Caleb arent doing so good...she loves him and everything...i think she just feels like its not what God wants. Its going to be a hard couple of weeks for her...but shell have me and sara and thats all she needs&lt;3 Saras going through the same thing with Devon as i am with Garret..and it sucks. but at least someone knows my pain.</P>
<P>Ive really started to notice how my friends are changing. Im becomeing extreamly close to Roach and Sara. And i barely ever talk to Taylor anymore. That makes me cry everytime i think about her. Its almost like her mom is tearin us apart...now that she goes to a different school and her mom is so insainly over protective that she never lets her go out&nbsp; i never see her anymore. Last year i hung out with mostly Alex Roxanna and Taylor and Danielle....that was our own little group. Now its like i hang out with Ande, Steph,Leah, JessicaR,Kate,Roach,Sara...that whole group. Its crazy how i now hang out with the people i hated last year...but i dont see how cuz there the greatest people...and i can not stand the people who i hung out with last year.</P>
<P>The retreat made me really ralize...what am i gonna do without you all next year? Who am i gonna turn to when it seems like no ones on my side? Whos shoulders am i gonna cry on? Who am i gonna run to with all my boy problems? Its gonna be sooo hard.</P>

<P><lj-cut text=""just some thoughts....that i needed to write down""> </P>
<P>Sometimes it scares me ....to think. To think about the future and where im gonna be when im 30, or even when im 16. I think about all the things that could possibally happen between now and then that would change my life, for the better, or for the worse. Like me finding God and starting to go to church, that was deffinatly a change for the better. But then i think about all the bad things that made me how i am today and the bad things to come in the future that will change me. Like me and Nikkita( if you know that story youll deffinatly know what im talking about...if not ask...ill probally tell you) my relationship with him made me a little scared of being in a relationship,and getting attatched to things and having them change on you....and turn into a different person...everytime i meet someone new that night&nbsp;comes into my head. and its harder for me now.&nbsp;Its not really that im afraid of changes, because changes can be good, i know that, and i know that everything happens for a reason. and that what is meant to be will happen. i just dont want to be hurt again and everytime i think of that....that night again pops into my head.....i dont know how much of this makes cents to you...probally none of it...but it makes cents to me....as im writing it</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My parents are starting to scare me too. Its just that everyones parents are splitting up...and i think mine might be next. Its not like i hear them fighting and stuff like that, they just are never talking to eachother anymore...and saying stuff that hints that they might split up. If they did i dont know what i would do. I wouldnt know who to live with,and things like that. It makes me cry just thinking about it....i wanted to ask my mom if she was ever thinking about it...but i cant....cuz shell just tell me no anyway....i dont know what to do....they make me so mad!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ok...so enough emotions for one night....im going to bed!</P>"

I didnt want to beliieve that my best friend got in trouble and moved away without even saying anythign to me. I remeber that night i called your house like 100 times to see make sure you were there. No one ever answered...I was so scared of losing my best friend that i cried...all night i just sat in my room in the middle or the floor and cried. I thought that i would never talk to you again...and when you IMed me last weekend i cried because i was so happy to talk to you and see that you were ok...even if it was for just a second. I know your going through a really hard time in your life right now but things will get better...just stay strong...youll get through them...im always praying for you...and praying that youll come home. I hope you know that i love you and i always will. Never forget about me. cuz i know ill always rembember you. I hope we stay in touch, even if you do end up staying up there forever. I love you soo much..im always here for you to talk about anything. I love you lyssa!</FONT></P>

I DONT LIKE HIM so you just needa get over yourself. its not like i asked him to like me better then you.so next year at school when you dont have any friends...dont go crying to your dady like last time and have him tell mr medred so i would get in trouble if we didnt hang out with you....bcuz this time i dont really give a fuck. im sick of you and your stupid 4th&nbsp; grade drama. dont try to talk to me, dont try ta be ffriends with me, and dont try to hang out with me...cuz . ill never trust you lik i did. ill never be able to talk to you like i did and ill never love you like i did....our friendship is over </P>

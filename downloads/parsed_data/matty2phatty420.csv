"event","My day was boring. 

I hung out with Travis, got high at geoff's, and talked on the phone for a while. 
So I was talking to Drina and I told her i found some tight pants I have. So I tried them on. I really dont like them. They are highly uncomforable. I have no clue as to why I'm still wearing them either.

So I guess that concludes my day. I didnt really do very much."

"event","Thank God for Al Franken!  Air America radio is so refreshing for me.  No longer do Democrats and Independents have to listen to right-wing cooks on the radio waves.  Visit Air America's website to listen or if you live in LA, NY, Chicago, Portland, and other locations around the country, a station is dedicated to you in your area:

On another note, I was visiting Bill O'Reilly's website tonight and found that he has created a ""French boycott"".  Why not start a Bush administration boycott?  They're the ones that misled the entire world about WMD's, what they knew before 9/11, and then of course, what I will talk about later tonight, Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9/11.  Don't boycott France, boycott Bill (and Fox News)."

"event","MSNBC had an article on their site about Bush's focus before 9/11.  I've been telling EVERYONE that I know how Rumsfeld and other administration officials focused purely on a missile defense shield, terrorism was never a major issue.  I'll give some excerpts here:

<i>On Sept. 11, 2001, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice was scheduled to outline a Bush administration policy that would address ""the threats and problems of today and the day after, not the world of yesterday"" -- but the focus was largely on missile defense, not terrorism from Islamic radicals.
 
The speech provides telling insight into the administration's thinking on the very day that the United States suffered the most devastating attack since the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor. The address was designed to promote missile defense as the cornerstone of a new national security strategy, and contained no mention of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden or Islamic extremist groups, according to former U.S. officials who have seen the text.

The speech was postponed in the chaos of the day, part of which Rice spent in a bunker. It mentioned terrorism, but did so in the context used in other Bush administration speeches in early 2001: as one of the dangers from rogue nations, such as Iraq, that might use weapons of terror, rather than from the cells of extremists now considered the main security threat to the United States.

The text also implicitly challenged the Clinton administration's policy, saying it did not do enough about the real threat -- long-range missiles.</i>

<i>The text of Rice's Sept. 11 speech, which was never delivered, broadly reflects Bush administration foreign policy pronouncements during the eight months leading to the attacks, according to a review of speeches, news conferences and media appearances. Although the administration did address terrorism, it devoted far more attention to pushing missile defense, a controversial idea both at home and abroad, the review shows.

Al Qaeda and Islamic terrorism rated lower on the list of priorities, as outlined by officials in their own public statements on policy.</i>

<i>During the summer of 2001, as al Qaeda operatives were in flight training and finalizing plans for the attacks, the administration's public focus was on other matters.

After his first meeting with NATO heads of state in Brussels in June 2001, Bush outlined the five top defense issues discussed with the closest U.S. allies. Missile defense was at the top of the list, followed by developing a NATO relationship with Russia, working in common purpose with Europe, increased defense spending in NATO countries, and enlarging the alliance to include former East European countries. The only reference to extremists was in Macedonia, where Bush said regional forces were seeking to subvert a new democracy.

Top officials continued that public focus right up to the eve of the al Qaeda attacks. On Aug. 2, 2001, Cheney emphasized the bold new U.S. plan for a 21st century approach to security. ""We're fundamentally transforming the U.S. strategic relationship around the world as we look at missile defenses and modifications to our offensive strategic arms,"" he said at a news conference with Republican congressional leaders on Capitol Hill.</i>

I'll just quickly interrupt there.  Cheney, Rumsfeld, and I believe Wolfowitz, all served in the Nixon administration and Rumsfeld served under Ford as the Defense Secretary.  These people have been and still live in the Cold War.  Our economic and foreign policies, instated by the Bush administration, are carbon copies of the Cold War.

This missile defense system is a Cold War system, created (at least the ""blue prints"") by paranoid right-wingers, frightened of the non-existent threat of communism or so-called ""rogue nations"".  Yes, there are rogue nations, but none of them have the capabilities to launch ballistic missiles."

"event","Today, I was reading the South Bend Tribune's editorial page and saw an article about our Congressman, Chris Chocola.  The administration, in cooperation with Congressional Republicans, are pushing a measure to misinform the public.  Republicans are attempting to alter the definition of manufacturing jobs to include fast food.  You heard me right, building burgers is a manufacturing job according to Republicans.  -_-  

I demand that the Bush administration and his Republican allies stop the misinformation campaign that they are a part of. E-mail your Congressman or Senator, telling them how displeased you are with the misinformation campaign that is taking place in our Capitol."

"event","Well ladies and gentlemen, this is my first post on the Live Journal.  I have created this to basically get things off my chest.  The world today has troubled me, especially politicians that are leading us in the troubled direction.  Whether it's the war in Iraq, censoring activists, the Patriot Act, or the Leave No Millionaire Behind tax cuts, I'm just pissed off.  Liberals in this country, though I'm not one of them, are treated like second class citizens by the media and by BOTH parties.

To tell you the truth, I don't believe the people in office right now are actually conservatives.  True conservatives are people like Pat Buchanan, respectable and honest individuals that mean the best for our nation.  The people currently in office are an imperialistic part of the Republican party that has hijacked the term ""conservative"".  These are neo-cons, former disgruntled Democrats from the south, that not only want to treat minorities like illegal aliens, but want to treat them like they are a different species.  These are evangelist radicals, people that use the Bible to gain power and money.  I'll stop my ideological bashing for now, so expect more substance in future posts.

Don't get me wrong though, I will be ""bashing"" both sides.  The Democrats are afraid to speak out against abortion or family values.  Republicans are funded by corporate launderers and they themselves are former corporate leaders."

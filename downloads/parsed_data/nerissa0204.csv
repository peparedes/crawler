"event","We had an excellent time.  I must say, I got pretty drunk and it was fun.  Kids played in the pool and on the swing set all day!  We ate good bbq that Tj prepared, it was sooooo good!  He had it marinating for 3 days.  Mmmmmm.  We decided we better be safe and not drive to the fireworks cause we were all drinking margaritas all day.  So we did some little ones of our own.  The kids still enjoyed it, plus I had sparklers and glow bracelets for them.  It was us, a few of our neighbors, and my friend that just moved down here, her mom, and two kids.  We had a lovely time.  I'm glad we hung out with some more neighbors.  It was funny cause they were saying it was cool to have social people in the neighborhood finally.  We were like, I know!  We been meeting people all year long, but no one socializes a lot.  So now we have a little clique, lol.  The couple is having their first baby and she is just miserable, lol.  She is terrified too, so I am sure she will be asking me a lot.  She already said she is gonna use me for drop in care when I have room.  

But anyways, imma go search the internet or something."

We got a picture frame, Jorden a Thomas the Train rug, 2 candles sets, some walkie talkie's for the kids, a sushi kit, a dog igloo house, and a couch!  We got an $80 sectional cream leather couch!  It is awesome find!  Our couches have gotten extremely uncomfortable, you can feel every spring, and everything.  They still look ok, but they are uncomfortable, so I am gonna see what I can get for them on Craigslist.  I am so excited for our new couch, it looks good in our living room!  And I can't believe they only wanted $100 and we talked him into $80!  They were an elderly couple, beautiful clean house, that just wanted to buy a new couch!  The pull out couch needs a new pad, and the recliner is wobly, but other than that, it's in good condition!  I'd say we had a great day rummaging!"

I drastically changed my diet because I realized I should probably loose 20 pounds this month to make my goal in July.  So, yogurt and fruit for breakfast.  Nothing but fruit and nuts for snack.  At the end of the week though, I'll have a sweet.  Probably keep it home made cake or muffin or something like that.  Nothing but salad for lunch and dinner.  I am allowing myself to put meat on my salad at dinner time as long as it is baked.  Or even a taco salad every now and again.  I'm prolly gonna add in brown rice once I see a significant amount of weight come off.  Drinking nothing but water daily.  Should be able to get to the grocery store tomorrow evening, we need to go, but are running extremely low on fruit.  I am hoping they have good of everything too so I can get a variety.  I really want some pineapples, haven't seen those yet.

I wish these kids would sleep so I can take a short SIM break, lol."

"event","I started a lovely bet with a friend of mine and her cousin which puts me at loosing 42.8 pounds by July 3rd.  I have motivation and stamina, but it seems like a lot to think about, lol.  We started last week and this week I lost a healthy 2 pounds.  Probably more, but cause I'm on my lovely period, my water weight is high.  I've been working out all week and ""dieting.""  I have been doing a mix of the Fat Smash Diet, with just portion sizing.  Seems to be working ok.  In the end, if I win, they both by me an outfit, and vice versa.  It will be nice.  I keep thinking positively.  

I should have a new girl starting on Monday, a 3year old.  That should be fun.  Jorden is surrounded by girls all day, lol.  He is every bit boy though.  Super hero to the fullest.  It's so cute.  He even has Jaylynn knowing the Superheroes.  We were watching something during dinner and I am like who is that, Jay goes, ""That's Aquaman, I know that cause I'm a smart girl.""  Lol, they crack me up.  Jorden started telling me about all them, and I got lost, lol.

"event","I haven't been on here in ages, well 5 weeks I guess, but it seems longer.  So, I have been doing ok.  We have had some woohaas and woonoooos that past few weeks.  Our vacations went well.  Vegas was awesome!  If you are on my Myspace or Facebook, you should have seen pics already.  Wisconsin was fun, didn't get to do much or see as many people as I wanted, but still, it was fun.  Good to see my sisters and mom again.  My baby is 3!!  I can't believe it.  We should be on our next kid already!!  Why is it taking so long!!  Well, we will continue to pray, and try of course.  Daycare business is going ok.  I just unexpectedly lost a kid this week so that sucks because we just got a new car!  Oh yeah, my Mitsu puked on me, engine completely died!  Over $2500 to fix, and with it already having close to 200k miles on it, we thought it was not worth it.  So we got a 2008 Hyundai Senata.  We have our first new car!!  Well, it was preowned, but not for long, has 32k for miles.  So now we are stuck with a car note.  Oh, well, it was much needed.  I LOVE the car.  

Tj and I have been doing good, working everything out still.  I believe we will stand the test of time though.  Marriage is good when you learn to trust and believe in it.  I am happy with the decisions I have made last year and this year, and now am looking towards the future.  

Jaylynn graduates pre-k in 3 weeks!  Can't wait, they are having a little ceremony and everything.  I am contemplating taking that day off from daycare so that I can go and not have any worries of bringing kids with me, or missing it because I have too many kids, we will see.  I know I'm taking off the first day of kindergarten, lol.  

Wedding business is going ok, finally starting to get my name out there more after my first wedding of the year a couple weekends ago.  Ugh, I have an idea for my blog though, that may help some more.  Gotta get some interviews with vendors lined up.  Tj has got the works for his catering business going.  We even have a dance studio wanting to use him as their personal caterer when they have events with them.  So that could work out great!!  Gotta start getting business cards made up and stuff.  So we are definitely keeping busy trying to get out businesses out there in this dang recession!!  

Blu and Sammie's puppy's are gorgeous!!  She had 7 of them.  I'll have to post a pic up.  We are taking one of them.  They should be ready this weekend, so yay to new puppy training!!  Haha, already bought disinfectant cleaner for all the accidents we are sure to have.  We are thinking of naming him Taz.  I have definitely turned into a dog lover and are getting better at owning them, lol.  Blu is trained very well, and we are proud of that.  

School, is school, still working at it, should be done I think June of next year now since I took a two week break a couple weeks ago.  I gotta stop that, lol.  

Alright, Imma catch up on everyone's journals since kids are still napping!"

So I start, it gets me to a person, I ask her what's going on?  She asks if I got a new phone?? No!  I told her I have been looking to upgrade since I have $175 for having the same phone for years.  So I tell her, you know my husband may be at the store right now getting me a new phone, could that be why?? And she is like, oh no, I don't want to tell you, sorry to tell you this, but your phone is now connected to the Palm Centro!!  Ha!!  Yes!!  When he gets home, I will have a new phone!!

But, by the end, I just wanna serve dinner and relax.  I barely made it down to my computer this week because I have just been chillen on the couch!  Tj had a decent check this week, so we got to pay more bills than we thought!  Yay!!  Lol.  And I got half of next weeks pay early since they will be with mom this weekend until Tuesday evening.  She will pay me the other half on Monday.  I will be mailing my packet in next week after I get my finger printing done, finally.  They are only open between 9-4, so I have been putting it off since that means Tj has to stay with the kids for a hour or so.  But, I need to get it in because then I can add more kids, and receive the food program benefits, which is extra money coming in to pay for food and stuff for the kids.  

I cleaned majorly after the kids left to make sure I had a relaxing weekend!  I blasted my ipod on the living room speakers and went to work, sweeping everywhere, scrubbing, dusting, wiping down the toys, and washing the kitchen up.  I picked up the bathrooms, but did not sanitize them yet.  I even did my bedroom.  I got all the laundry lined up to start tomorrow, and I want to clean my refrigerator, I have noticed some spills in there that have been getting on my nerves.  

Anyway, Jay and Jor are up watching Ice Age 2, probably fell asleep by now, and I am gonna get some homework done, and then hit up the Sims until Tj gets home."

"event","First week of my daycare almost done.  I have been watching 1 3 year old all day, and his sister when she comes home from school.  She goes to school with Jaylynn, so Tj picks her up.  Tj's best friend and his family have been here visiting all week before he had to leave back for Iraq today.  : (  I have been watching their kids too, 5 and 3.  So it has been like 4 kids all day, and 6 kids in the afternoon, lol.  I got used to it really quick!!  I enjoy the little boy, but his older sister, I could do with out.  Let's just say lack of discipline, she acts like she is deaf, she's lazy (I have to make her put her own shoes on and she is about to turn 5), and you can clearly tell she has been bribed with food for the first 3 years.  Poor girl.  The 3 year old boy, although he's very small, I think he was a preemie cause he is like Jorden's size who is only about to turn 3 and this little boy will be 4 this year, but anyway, he is very smart, although he has listening issues, not as bad as his sister, and his attention span is a lot longer as well.  

But enough ranting.  I need to look up some more activities to plan my next few weeks.  I forget how short attention spans are at the toddler age and when I was thinking 30 minutes for an activity, I am getting 15-20.  So I need to revamp, lol.  They love going outside though, of course, what kid doesn't.  But man it has been cold.  Yesterday we only lasted 15 minutes before they were all complaining.  

I like the idea of actually having money coming in every week!!  This is awesome, lol.  Granted it's only $90, but hey man, that is cool!  Hopefully I should have some more kids soon.  

Well, they are all napping, I cleaned the kitchen while they were eating lunch, and now I am gonna do some homework while I have chance. 


BTW, my computer is completely taken over by the virus.  It changed my background to black with flashing red note that says I have a virus and need to take action.  I can't push control alt delete anymore, it says the administrator turned that off!!  I am gonna bring it somewhere tonight or tomorrow depending on where it is.  Hopefully they can save my hard drive.  Abra, my friend who's daughter did it, offered to pay for the fix.  Thank GOD she is very nice and understandable that her daughter did it, and she will fix it.  


Oh, before I go, Blu's punk self may have gotten his girlfriend, our lovely neighbor's dog pregnant!!  I hope not!!!  We caught them in the middle of the action yesterday and tried to get them apart and they were stuck!!!! UGH!!!!  They said she was on her last few days of her heat.  Ugh, I knew we should have gotten him neutered a long time ago!!  I hope she is not pregnant."

I need to get my rooms set up.  I have been waiting to see what ages I have, that will determine what and how many of each toy I would need.  I need to go buy a small table.  At my CPR class on Saturday, I met with a lady that was a teacher, and she said she has tons of stuff and she found a daycare in the area that is closing, so she will let me know when they are selling all the stuff, so I can go.  That is cool, but I hope they aren't too pricy, because our monetary situation doesn't really have room for extras.  I have some things, and definately enough activities to keep everyone occupied, I think my room will look better to parents though when I have it fully set up.  Anyway, this is going great, and I am glad I decided to do this!!

And we will continue to try again for another baby after this passes.  I chose to do it naturally, unless they need to intervene and get everything out later.  I actually had a much better experience at the ER than last time, so I felt better, and they actually advised to me that a DNC, or whatver it is, can scar the uteris, so the doctor advised that I pass it naturally, and come back for a follow up to make sure everything is clear.  


Ugh... I really was expecting a baby in 6-7 months."

I am pissed about Susan and Mike.  WTF!!! After all they been through, all that I cried over in the past seasons, all that, and they break up!!!!  I am definately pissed about that.  Bree not having the baby!!  WTF!!  That was just rude.  But Bree is definately a biotch to Catherine, and I can see this blowing up in her face later.  Gabby and her fat kids, poor kids.  I hope that fixes.  And are Lynette's twins super ugly or what!!  What happened to her other 2 kids?? I hope they don't disappear into tv land, lol.  What about Edie's new hubby, psycho!!  Who do you think he's after??  I am thinking Mike or Orson....but I'm not sure just yet.  

Brothers & Sisters, love this show.  I am mad a Sarah though, she has such a big mouth, and always had.  Tommy is such a downer all the time too, he is never happy, and I can't believe he fired Kevin.  I felt so bad for Kevin.  I think Sarah may be getting fired in the future as well.... but we shall see.  

You know after all my shows just came back on, I feel like part of my life is back, lol!!  It's a great feeling.  I pretty much sat and watched those and then watched Sex & the City movie yesterday, which was great!  The kids were playing right on the porch off the living room, so it was great, lol.  

Oh, and then when Tj got home we watched Heroes, lol, so it was a tv day, all day. Filled with great shows."

"event","Did some housework this morning, cleaned the office again, man Jaylynn loves to draw and make pictures, but she has discovered scissors and leaves paper EVERYWHERE!&nbsp; Even when I clean it up at night, there she is again in the morning, lol.&nbsp; I cleaned the kitchen.&nbsp; Our electric bill has been astronomical, and we can't figure it out, so I have been only doing the dishwasher every other day.&nbsp; The air has been off all month, so maybe that will help.&nbsp; We should be getting our next bill soon.&nbsp; 

Yesterday was my mom's birthday.&nbsp; I called her and wished her well and everything, but it sucks that I can't sit and have a piece of cake with her or anything.&nbsp; Or take her salsa dancing or something.&nbsp; We sent her a package of cards, one I made, and a few Jaylynn made.&nbsp; I also sent her a framed picture of the kids for her desk, that I decorated the frame with some grandma stickers, lol.&nbsp; It was cute, but I wish I could have sent more, we are definately on the broke side lately.&nbsp; I'm just glad are bills are starting to come back together, and the car's are running.&nbsp; Got two things to fix on the truck, a part on the rear tire, and the body damage, and it is good.&nbsp; But at least it's drivable now.&nbsp; 

I have been really thinking I need to go back to work full time so we can catch up faster and start doing things we want and need.&nbsp; We have our anniversary coming up (thank God we are making it, lol), Halloween, Thanksgiving, which is going to be here at our house and we have yet to buy a dining table, we only have our four seater and 2 bar stools.&nbsp; We also have Christmas coming of course and we are going up north for that if we can save enough, and we have been planning Disney in February for Jaylynn's 5th birthday since she was born!&nbsp; It sucks, because day care is super expensive and that's the reason I quit working to begin with, but maybe we can find a nice in home day care that is not that expensive, but still interacts and teaches the kids.&nbsp; Jaylynn would just go to after school care at her school, so I just need to find Jorden a place.&nbsp; It would be nice if he could go to where Jay is, but damn, they are super expensive!!&nbsp; I am glad Jaylynn's pre-k is only $100 a month for food.&nbsp; They were talking $150 a week for Jorden for part time!!&nbsp; WTF!&nbsp; I really hate day care, lol.&nbsp; But we do get that tax break for the amount we paid during taxes, so that's always a plus.&nbsp; 

Ok, I'm rambling.&nbsp; Bout to go put the kids to nap.&nbsp; 


Who watched the debate last night?&nbsp; I hope everyone did.&nbsp; McCain was really strong in international affairs.&nbsp; That is a big deal to me with the troops.&nbsp; But I am still an Obama fan.&nbsp; Currently, I have not made my final decision, but I the debates always help.&nbsp; All I have to say is Tuesday they both need to step it up.&nbsp;"

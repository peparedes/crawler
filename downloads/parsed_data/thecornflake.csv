"event","American society is evil. It teaches little children to be greedy and self centered, and diguises it as good. Sucess is monetary. Self-worth is monetary. There is a ""standardized"" measure of intelligence and potential. Follow our laws. Study harder, its more important than talking to people. Make more money, dont listen to people who try to distract you. Become what we want you to be.  

success?"

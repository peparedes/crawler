"event","Hey, it's livejournal! I <i>completely</i> forgot about this thing until I stumbled upon an old friends'. Then, remembering I had one, I read it and once again realized how positively NECESSARY these things are to keeping some sort of sanity.

Recap:

<b>1. I graduated AMDA</b>
Top of my class, if that's possible in Conservatory. I made all three final demos plus VPS tour in the third semester, which is the highest honor any student can receive. Basically, I performed a Broadsword fight from King Henry VI Part 2 for the entire school and guests, a scene from ""The Maiden's Prayer"" by Nicky Silver (as Libby, one of my favorite characters of all time), THE FREAKING SLEEP WALKING SCENE from Macbeth, and toured the school doing a Shakespeare monologue. A highly productive semester. Also, side note: David Martin - the CREATOR of AMDA, pulled me and Roxanna (my coach) aside and told us that I was the best Lady Macbeth he had ever seen. Which is awesome considering the man is 200 years old and has probably seen his fair share of The Scottish Play.

<b>2. ROMANCE</b>
I dated Randy, the tranny. I fell absolutely head over heels in love with him, and he was pretty close to feeling the same way apparently when he up and left AMDA, returned to Jersey, and broke my heart in the process. It's been a little over a year since then and I still hurt a little when I think about him, especially because we for some reason no longer talk, but I am trying to move on.
And by that I mean I dated a girl for a few months. She was British and a paintball player, and not a butch, and awesome, but after those few months of very intimate and wonderfully creative lesbian sex, I decided that I couldn't love a woman the way she cared about me.
So I had a threesome with some people.
It was awesome.

<b>3. Brooklyn</b>
I live here now! It's amazing, I love it. Although I will be moving to Halla-Harlem when my lease is up in January.

<b>4. Career</b>
Since graduating AMDA I did an Eve Ensler show in Jersey City, and am in an upcoming Off-Broadway Showcase with TAPNYC in front of at least a dozen agents. We'll see what happens.

<b>5. Drugs</b>
Love 'em.

And that's whats going on.

Hi, I'm Chelsey. And I pretty much raped and destroyed my shell since moving to New York.

And now, I'm me :-)"

"event","I love how the instant that that seemingly unreachable state of being becomes a possibility for me, I become completely smitten with <u>one</u> boy.

Prospects:

<b>Shane</b>
One of my <i>Jekyll & Hyde</i> co-workers, Shane is also an actor and has a wonderfully biting sense of humor. He's deeply sarcastic and genuinely fun to be around. I was invited by him and two of his roommates (both of which also work at <i>Jekyll</i> to come over on several accounts to smoke and just hang out.) He's deeply layed back and seems to be pretty fantastic.
Tall, thin, long blonde hair. 21.

<b>Kevin</b>
NOT SINGLE, but I swear I am in love with this man. He's one of my <i>Jekyll</i> managers, and I have never met a more sincerely funny man in my life. He's so smart and witty, does United Citizen's Bregade IMPROV, and has a tendency to lean towards stage combat and Shakespeare. Hence, he's the love of my life. He's so sweet and darling... I get butterflies whenever I'm around him and I ALWAYS look forward to seeing him. It litearlly tends to be the highlight of my week. Silly and girly, but wonderful.
Tall (6'3""), has some meat, crazy medium brown hair. 23.

<b>Randy</b>
Aforementioned. It's so strange. I always feel happy around him, even when I'm complaining about something completely random. It's odd, I really think that this could be a great and healthy relationship, but I don't have anything to compare the possibility to - my relationship with Robert was far from healthy. It was so filled-to-the-brim with drama, and I so often wasn't at my happiest around him, so it's really blowing my mind that I could have a relationship that is just two people who like each other, hanging out, enjoying one another's company, and who happened to be extremely attracted to one another.

Last night we stayed up and cuddled while watching ""Enchanted."" The way he touches me is just amazing. I know Robert loved me with everything he had, but sometimes Randy kisses me and there's just <b>so much </i>passion</i></b> - it's utterly amazing. 
And apparently the boy is completely taken with me - he asked me out on a date this Friday. :-) (We've previously been to see Eddie Izzard together as well.) Also according to word of mouth, he's been using words like ""smitten"" and ""infatuated"" to describe his feelings towards me.

<u>I DON'T KNOW.</u> I feel like if Randy doesn't get his head out of his ass, get over his fears of being used, and asks me to be something a little more serious (as in exclusive, but not SERIOUS serious - I don't want that either) I am going to play the field and see what's out there.

Apparently I'm attractive now, and I want to take advantage of that before it slips away."

"event","I'm freaking out. It's the end of only the first day of my ten day no-people break and I am flipping out. I tried to stay productive... got up, went for a run (my new habit I'm super proud of), started packing to move into my single, organized some stuff, saw Cloverfield (holy crap it was awesome), and I'm still going crazy.

I can keep myself busy easy enough, but it's the lack of company that kills me. For every hour I don't have someone distracting me, it's an hour that I'm vulcan death-gripping my phone trying so hard not to text or think of Robert. Is this what break-ups are like? I thought I was fine... we've basically been in the process of breaking up for three months so it got a little easier each time... but he was always <i>there</i>. Oddly enough that's part of the reason why we can't be together. He will never move from his situation unless he gets himself in gear.

I don't know. I wouldn't take him back if he asked me to... but that doesn't mean I don't miss him. I still love him. Am I in love with him still? I'm not sure, but I am in love with the way that he made me feel. Nothing can compare to his arms wrapped around me, or cuddling looking into his eyes. But that's gone now and I have to accept that.

Alexandra and I celebrated our demo-finale with a trip to my work. What originally started out as me just checking my schedule and showing her my new digs ended up being dinner and a drunk Chelsey. Half the time my colleagues have seen me, I've been intoxicated. But they bought me all the drinks last night so I don't feel too bad.

It was great, sitting there with my new friend who I appretiate so much (she did introduce me to Sex & the City afterall, and took care of me when I had a concusion), talking to all four of the sexy male waiters who (if I'm not mistaken) were flirting with me, having my manager Kevin buy me a drink, while being sarcastic. It was a great way to finish off the day.

BUT THEN we're walking home talking about how we probbaly have alcohol problems (we've drank after every one of our demos in celebration) and this gorgeous 6'6"" dark & handsome man starts a conversation with us. Graduate of Berkley & Columbia, from Spain, and a very important man at a well-known bank, Horhay (I'm not sure how to spell his name: ""whore-hay"") walked with us for about ten blocks. I swear to you, this man was the king of Spain in disguise. He enjoyed his job, but fancied to do something more creative with his life.

Beautiful.
Goal-orientated.
Creative.
Polite.
Fucking rich as hell.
Not creepy.
Smelled fantastic.

Why, what's that you say? ""Chelsey, did you ask him for his phone number? As he clearly was interested since he said, 'I could go for a drink right now' and walked up to you to start a conversation? Plus, you were drunk so it wouldn't have been a big deal.""

<B>NO.</b> That's right. I successfully ruined my one chance at true happiness because I have such low self-esteem I am still convinced he was more interested in Alexandra than myself.

What the hell. 
Isn't alcohol supposed to make all your problems go away?

I am <i>miserable</i>."

"event","I definitely lost/forgot my password to this livejournal, and therefore haven't posted since... October 9th, 2007. Seems kind of fitting that my last post was two days before my first semester at AMDA, and now this post is three days before the end of said semester.

Brief Re-Cap:

Robert and I tried to make it work. But he's never going to change. I visited him over Christmas break and I really thought that seeing me would help him change to become less possessive. I was wrong. I am no one's property, and I will not have my feelings abused. We haven't talked in the past month.

I get really lonely sometimes.

I went to a club and made out with two men... who happened to be roommmates.

I got a job at Barnes & Noble.
I lost that job since I was apparently only hired as season help.
I'm pretty sure I rang up Tim Burton.

I now Hostess at The Jekyll & Hyde Club which is pretty badass.
I am completely infatuated with one of the managers there.
He's taken.
Story of my life.

I am an RA for The Stratford Arms, $787.50/month. This will successfully pay back my parents, pay off any bills I may accumulate here, and hopefully support my newly re-discovered shoe addiction. This also means I will be the proud owner of my own single dorm, which is about 1/4 the size of the dorms at Western.
That's right, you can pee and shower at the same time. Not because you're peeing <i>in</i> the shower, but just because they're on top of one another.

I have had my final presentation in Acting: Technique, Stage Combat, & Acting: Scene Study. All of which kicked ass. 
Tomorrow I have a four and a half hour Dance Demo & a Shakespeare Demo.
After that just Theatre History (in which I am doing an Emilia/Desdemona scene from ""Othello""), Practicum Demo, & VPS.
Not too shabby.

I will be literally in NY all by myself from February 8-17th. I will try very hard not to kill myself or have sex with this one guy whose going to be here that I have had a crush on since I moved even though I'm pretty sure he's either bi or gay.

Yup."

This is my costume. Sans hat, for it consists of the board attached via elastic which is nay too comfortable around the throat. It will instead be worn as a bracelet.

And I have to work out the shoes.

"event","It's been a while. I feel like a certain pair of testicles has been taking up space on this journal far more than it should. As such, I am declaring a break from writing about the woes and misadventures of first loves and seemingly doomed relationships. For now.

<i>I try to write like I'm smart. I hope it fools people.</i>

While I was filing in the hellhole known as my work today, I thought about my upcoming move and my career choice. I am unbelievably excited to move to New York in ten days. Yes, partly because of AMDA, but also because of the array of people that I will undoubtedly run into and have (hopefully) deep conversations with. Think about it. New York is a city of dreamers, and of people with enough motivation to move to a city whose reputation is horrible to pursue those dreams. That in itself is admirable. But all the different perspectives, all the different stories, sensations, and experiences that await me... that is one of the biggest things I am excited and yet terrified for. Maybe I'll even get to bullshit with a french woman for a few minutes?

<lj-cut text=""I'm really scared sometimes."">

I also thought to myself today, ""Gee, Chelsey. Since you've managed to dig yourself into $18,000+ of debt for this 'academic year' alone, are you sure this is what you want to spend said money on?"" I stumbled for a second, which scared me. But then I realized that stumble was due to fear. Sure, it would suck to be in a situation where I cannot afford to school myself on my other major passion (biology) because I dug myself into a 18,000 foot hole, but really this is the only thing I can see myself doing on a day-to-day basis. Working a 9-5 makes me want to kill myself, and being stuck in a sterile lab all day seems like it would end in an equally morbid way. The adventure, and the learning associated with acting; the storytelling, the truth, and the change theatre can bring about in everyone's lives are what draw me to it as an art. Coupled with the fact that I'm apparently talented - I'm pretty sure I'm on the right track. Otherwise, I wouldn't feel like I have something to offer.

It sucks that my roommate is an MTV loving girly-girl who has never actually acted in her life (but somehow managed to rack up an impressive scholarship) but she is seemingly pretty decent so there really isn't that much for me to fear. 

I also wondered if AMDA really is the right place for me. Is it really that amazing? Or would my money be better invested in Lee Strasberg or similiar conservatories? I really don't know. But I do know I owe myself one year at each campus. And I owe myself the chance to believe that I can be great. Because I'm through believing that I'm second rate at my first rate passion. 

And if I turn out to be wrong, please spread the word that I will be selling my services as a <b>clean</b> ""working girl"" in order to pay off said debts and obtain numerous other degrees. Hey, at least it's deviant behavior with the goal of higher education in mind."

"event","In a heartbeat, everything has turned around and has become amazing.

I was so upset leaving Kalamazoo and basically my family, but I've come back to something wonderful.

I started work up again at Stillman's, and lo-and-behold, just like my sister stated, a cute boy was working there by the name of Robert. When I was having issues on the male front and swore to become a suicidal nun for the rest of my (surely short-lived) life, Carly called and told me to wait things out until I met this boy.

In the past week I have:

1) Gained acceptance to AMDA, NY
2) Got a $6,000 scolarship to said school
3) Attained a my first boo
4) <b>Felt good about myself</b>


<lj-cut text=""This requires LJ-cut"">

<u>Let's start with numbers one and two:</u>
When I auditioned for AMDA in Chicago on the 20th (11 days ago) something just clicked. I walked into that room and knew that my life was about to start. Sure, it technically started senior year when I met the people I will forever keep in my life, but this is the start of the next chapter.
TYLER came through when I performed in a way I did not expect. She was so sassy and spunky, and spiteful... I literally felt like I was this woman who was so scorned but too proud to to admit that she had let guard down. And then NAN just flowed out of me in ways I can't even describe. I looked at my person and just let everything go - the disgust, the self-hatred, the plea for forgiveness... it was quite possibly the most eloquent moment of my life (odd seeing as how it's not really mine).
But I basically felt I succeeded, and I knew I nailed my interview since the man who interviewed me took a liking to me the moment I stepped off the elevator.
As for the scholarship I am of course very excited, but I will admit I was hoping for a bit more.. $31,000 a semester is not cheap, and it means some severe cuts in the spending I had hoped to do this summer... so basically <i>all</i> the spending I had hoped to do.

<u>THE BOO:</u>
Robert Cox is an amazing twenty-two year old who is smart, handsome, kind, funny, and everything in between. While we are not ""officially"" a couple, the 16 hours we spent together yesterday makes me think we will be soon. I've never felt so wonderful before. I feel so different when I'm with him, and it's something I want to hang on to.

<u>Self-Progress:</u>
In just the past few days I've made significant strides in how I feel about myself. I've began a <i>healthy</i> (& successful) diet & exercise program, and have been more truthful with myself and others. I used to be such a people-pleaser that it would sometimes come at my own expense, but now I find it really is easier just to be blantantly truthful about the entire situation rather then just beat around the bush and not hope to hurt someone.

That being said, I'd like to apologize to Mike WHO HOPEFULL HASN'T LEFT FOR ITALY YET! for blowing you off that one day. I got in a tift with my father and was sort of emotionally not stable to hang out with anyone. I'm sorry I haven't called you back yet, I just didn't want you to be peeved (obviously I realize that would be avoided had I called you). You actually mean quite a bit to me, so hopefully we can hang out if you haven't left yet. If not... I guess I'm sending your Italian ass some post cards :-)</lj-cut>

So yes, life is unexpedly wonderful right now and I thank God for every moment of it."

2) Being blacked out doesn't excuse horrible, horrible actions.

3) Just because you're gay and in love with me doesn't mean you can try to punch me & let the air out of my tires.

4) I miss Kalamazoo so much.

5) James, Mark, Grant, and Brian are the loves of my life. I owe those boys so much.

6) Theres a nasty rumor going around that I slept with Brian (who is one of my [ex]friend's ex-boyfriend) the night they broke up... and again when we went to state. This is completely ridiculous in they way that:

a. Everyone who knows me knows I'm a v-card carrying member, and plan on giving that up when and ONLY when I'm in reciprocated love.

b. I was in Livonia when they broke up... and they were both in Kalamazoo.

c. When we went to state I slept between Joel and Grant. 

... so unless my vagina is a ninja, that's pretty much impossible

This film, Jesus Camp, is perhaps the most amazing film I've ever seen. Controversial, hilarious, and scarier then most horror movies can ever hope to be, it was truely a film every single person with a mind should see.

I cannot express how much I have to say about this. God is about love, not hate, and these ""Christians"" are turning their <i>children</i> into foot soldiers with a political agenda. How can you force these children into your beliefs when they're not even educated enough to know what a judicial system is, what a fetus is?

These people make me sick. 

Where does it say God is about hate, about segregation, about the Republican Party?? If anything, Democrats are closer to Jesus.

Oh man. This is why I say I have FAITH, not a religion."

1. About three years ago my family and I were seated at a Big Boy's restaurant (specifically the one located at Newburgh & 6 Mile). As many of you know, their tables do not have support underneath via a leg or something. Instead, they're industriustly glued to the wall. Well, we were all enjoying our appetizers when the table FALLS ON MY LAP, sending my soup everywhere. We all got a laugh out of it.

2. Last year, I took my parents to Station 885 for their anniversary. We were sitting in a both, and I was closest to the wall. Half way through the meal, two pictures that were hung on that wall fall. On my head. The first one was a shock, and as soon as I was getting over it, the second one hit me square on the cranium. We all got a laungh out of it, because once again, something falls on Chelsey.

3. TODAY, Lindsey Phillips and I are seated down at a Taco Bell enjoying our cheesey gordita crunches and a FLIPPEN CELING TILE falls from the heavens and hits me.

<CENTER>WHAT THE HELL.</CENTER>

I think this is God telling me that I shouldn't be so nice and sue. I didn't, this time, but with my luck it won't be too long before another falling object injures me in some shape or form."

HEY!: there is a shot out now that prevents HPV. GET IT! It's $135 right now (since insurance doesn't cover it) but save up and GET IT!! It works best if you haven't had sex yet, but if you have and you DON'T have HPV or any other STIs, you should definitely get it. Anyone can get HPV whether or not they're 'partner' currently has an outbreak and it's something you can <b>never get rid of</b>. Inquire about it. Get it. Protect yourself. All that jazz."

Working as an extra? <b>AMAZINGLY AWESOME.</B></center>

I haven't had that much fun in so long. The PA's and crew were so nice, and all the other extra's were so cool. It was a little like a meat factory... I got hit on pretty much non-stop, which I of course account to the fact that my perfect breasts were on display ;-). That and I was just so comfortable on set, it was easy to be myself.

I really hope a lot of us can do the whole ""dressing up for the premire"" thing - that would be <i>sweet</i>.

I love love love love love love love love Laura!! Working with her - awesome. Our shared humor - awesome. She's pretty much amazing :-) While we were leaving, a PA gave her some information about acting as an extra in Chicago and I completely butted in - ""My name is Chelsey Curry, I'd love to do some extra work in Chicago!"" haha

There is seriously so much to write about... ah!

<lj-cut text=""awwwww yea"">

I WAS DIRECTED BY <B>MICHAEL BAY</B> HIMSELF. The last scene, I was placed at the very front, on the ground, in front of a taxi. I was previously further back and one of the PA's took me to the front where Michael Bay looked at me and told me where the robot was, what to do, ect. It was pretty surreal mostly because it was Michael Bay. But basically there was BOOM an explosion, I groveled, turned around and ran like hell.

All in all, I was <i>right by</i> two of the three explosions. Not just near, or looking at, but <i>right next to</i>. And since I am too cool for the earplugs they passed out, I am partially deaf right now :-)

Laura can vouch for me on this, the other extra's - SO FUNNY! We were watching the main explosion from the top floor of the holding area (trying not to be caught by Bay) and it was deemed that the theme song of the day was ""Sexy Back."" haha, I love black guys. But THANKFULLY we were placed in the intersection with the exploding semi (which I was RIGHT BY) so we didn't get to see it, but rather experience it.

God, it was just so much fun, and such a valuable experience. I can definitely see myself making connections doing this and paying the bills while I continue to learn my craft.

I still can't get over Michael's awesome Fonze-esque, brown leather, bad-ass jacket.

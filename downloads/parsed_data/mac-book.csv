"event","So I'm free.  After some nasty Chinese people attacked me and stuffed me in a box, and the jet noises.  I was placed on a truck for most of the day.  After the truck noise, there was some gentle handling and a weird car sound (dare I say it was British?).

Anyway, I was removed from my prison to this bright light, and the first thing I see is beard.  I was saved!"

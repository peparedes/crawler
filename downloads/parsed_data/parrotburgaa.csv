If you don't like me, you'll have to live with it.




I automatically assume a black is a thief, a mexican just wants to fight someone, and a jew is looking for money. 

I think women ARE sex objects, because they can't do anything else right.

I base my opinions on people on music taste and whether they write poetry.

If their music taste involves anything I truly dislike, they'll never hear the end of it.

If they do write poetry, I make fun of them and say they're gay.

I think art is a waste of time and artists are losers who will never make it in life.

Violence rules when it hurts anyone but me and Sam.



Here's the biggest shocker about me:

I'm a 16 year old who doesn't think George Bush has something in common with Hitler and wants to ""take over the world."" I actually think we have a nice government. Anyone who wants to bring it down for childish ""anarchy"" or because Green Day told them to should try living in a poorly governed area for a week. They'll wish they had shut their mouths and lived happily in the USA.

Because you see, no one has any real problems with the government until they make them. Nothing has happened to these dumb kids to make the government seem bad, they just find shit to complain about to fit in.

But I am going off topic.

Quit being pussies, I am always right, you are always wrong, IDK.

"event","So, a while ago, I had an awesome idea..

I have like, a lot of short BRR songs, plenty under 10 seconds. So I added up the total time for about 15 BRR songs that are 1-15 seconds long, and it came to like 73 seconds. So one day I wanna just play those live. Make people pay like 10 bucks (I'll find the most expensive place that will let me play there), then play just a little over a minute long set. That would be funny.

lololol

I'm not doing anything important today."

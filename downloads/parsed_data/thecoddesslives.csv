It's not a huge change, and I doubt most of the people I removed will even notice.  

Basically, if you have more than one journal, I probably removed the one you never use anymore.  Some of you never posted in the one journal you have.  Some of you have stopped talking, stopped trying, or have very clearly shown that you are not interested in maintaining a friendship.  I am not angry.  I am not doing this out of spite.  

If I removed your journal and you want it to be added back, drop a comment.  All comments are screened.  


Also, since I met a bunch of awesome people this summer, and especially this past weekend in Maryland, leave a comment (using the name you used when we were introduced, please!), and I'll add you if I know you.  I've already added a few new people.

<i>I read a note my grandma wrote back in 1923. 
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me.
He said, ""Boy, you might not understand, 
but a long, long time ago, 
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, 
but I loved your Grandma so.""  

""We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together, 
get married in the first town we came to and live forever.  
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, 
instead, I found this letter, and this is what it said:  

<b>If you get there before I do, 
don't give up on me.  
I'll meet you when my chores are through.  
I don't know how long I'll be.  
But I'm not gonna let you down, 
darling, wait and see, 
and between now and then, 
till I see you again, 
I'll be loving you.  
Love, me.""</b>

I read those words just hours before 
my Grandma passed away, 
in the doorway of a church
where me and Grandpa stopped to pray. 
I know I'd never seen him cry 
in all my fifteen years, 
but as he said these words to her, 
his eyes filled up with tears.

"event","President Bush has frozen funding for student aid. And now he's hitting young people up for a massive loan. His new budget will increase the national debt by a half-trillion dollars this year alone. Of course, young people are the ones who will have to pay down Bush's debt through higher taxes and cuts to vital services. 

Students, send this message to Bush: LOAN DENIED! 

A new site we've helped launch provides a funny and productive way to say no to the Bush loan. Click the link below to reject Bush's credit -- and when you do, MoveOn Voter Fund will earn $1 in matching funds. 

http://www.clickbackamerica.org/petition1.php?id=17 

President Bush has asked all Americans to go into further debt, not for priorities such as education but for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and our war with Iraq. Bush, in his most recent budget, has asked all of us for a $4,500 loan against our future earnings. This is in addition to the $13,000 each of us already owes for the national debt, now totaling more than $7 trillion. 

The campaign to reject George Bush's credit is part of a new effort the MoveOn.org Voter Fund is co-sponsoring called the ""College Click Drive,"" together with a group called Click Back America. Click Back America is a great way for college students to get active. And for every student that takes action, the MoveOn Voter Fund gets a $1 contribution for our efforts to expose Bush Administration policies. We'll be tracking how students around the country do, and the school with the most matching contributions will win a big prize.

<lj-cut text=""12 reasons why gay people should not be allowed to get married"">

1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control. 

2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children. 

3. Obviously, gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. 

4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage is allowed, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful. 

5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal. 

6. Gay marriage should be decided by people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities. 

7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. 

8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. 

9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. 

10. Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children. 

11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to things like cars or longer lifespans. 

12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a ""separate but equal"" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.

Thanks soooo much to <lj user=""operafloozy""> and <lj user=""krazylokoguy""> (and everyone else) for passing this along.  Too funny for words.  </lj-cut>

That is all.  Have a lovely day.


ETA: Every time I do one of those rainbow birthdays, my colors and spacing get screwy.  All will return to ""normal"" in the next entry."

"event","My phone died.  No one fixed it.  For two weeks.  

Yesterday, I got up at 9AM and spent half an hour on the (other) phone with AT&T.  They fixed it.  

I spent the next 16 hours online, catching up on everything I'd missed... especially you people.  (I missed you!!)

I promise there will be a more detailed and substantial post at some point soon, but for now, I just wanted all of you who did not even notice I was missing to know that I am, in fact, alive.  And kicking.  

Quick notes: 

1) Happy birthday, Aaron!  Sorry I missed it. 
2) Katie, we need to talk.  You have me kicking myself in the head at least three or four times, if I recall correctly.  I'd like the opportunity to defend myself.  
3) I have cheesecake.  Cheesecake is good.  

I think that about does it for now.  Talk to you all soon!"

Cheese can sit in the fridge for months without being noticed.  Let's say the expiration date was yesterday, but the cheese is still good today.  Why do we assume that the cheese will magically <i>stay</i> good?  Why is it we go back a week later and are surprised that the cheese is green?  


Relationships are like cheese....  

and that girl is starting to smell funny."

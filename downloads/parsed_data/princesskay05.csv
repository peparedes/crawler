first off we got christina who couldnt get her mind out of the gutter
-bakes- yea we tried snowboarding this weekend but i think i was on my knees more than i was on the board

-me- ok so does everything hae to be so dirty with you? gte your mind out of the gutter
haha gotta love her

thennnn
3rd hour comes along
gotta love 3rd hour talks
todays topic: random cards and roses
ok do you guys realize how many random cards there are out there? ""Happy circumcision!"" or ""Happy mammogram!"" i mean arn't those things a little personal to be getting a card for?

and then came the roses talk...
Roses
me and kaitlyn have decided that there is no better gift then to recieve roses from someone... anyone
i mean material things are material things but i think that it really takes thought to get someone roses because it says you care in one way or another

ok no big deal i do them every day
oh but today it was a big deal
FLY off my edge, arms out like im flying, land on my stomach/shoulder(which has my calcium thingy on it already) woo i thought i'd died and came back to life
my coach thought i knocked the side of my head on the ice but somehow i didnt thank god...
yea i cried, 
it hurt
it still does hurt
and all i was thinking about was, man i hope im ok for the concert for tomorrow cause that would suck if my arm was put in a sling

yea
so went to school (daddy drove me cause my mom thought it wasn't a good idea to drive with the drugs still in me W/E)
school was boring as usual... but i don't have to much homework to make up! yay for that one!
def totally lost in my comp3 class tho... oh well
decided i'm not going to Cupid's Ball cause like hardly any of my friends are :( that's ok, me and kt are making our own cupids ball LOL 

yea so came home and talked online a little 
then left for like almost 3 hours and ran all the many errands i had to run...

-got my nails filled (and while i was there i watched Oprah and it was her 50th birthday so they had this like surprise show for her and it was the cutest Oprah i've ever seen... Stevie Wonder played like my all time favorite song by him [isn't she lovely] it just put me in the best mood) i dunno theres just something about having your nails done. It like makes you feel all cute and girly-ish. haha

-went and got the van washed... great story on this one lol. Yea so after i get through and i started breathing again (cause i'm like totally deathly afraid of car washes, especially when i've never gone through one by myself ahhh) anyways, so i get through and my mirrors are like turned in from the guy so i roll down my window and i'm like uhh are you gonna fix my windows (i wasn't gonna tip him till he did lol) so he doesn and i go to give him his 2 dollar tip and he's all like so do i get a phone number with this tip? i was like ummm no (yea he was like 20 at least and Mexican) haha but his friend was cute(i shouldve gave him my number lol 'cept he was like 21 also<- well i could be like kait LOL)
yea but anyways i drove away laughing and i was in such a good mood cause i made it through the car wash! and got hit on lol... wow

-next i went tanning at Metropolitan by meijers and like the hottest guy is working so i'm like trying to act like i know what he's talking about when he was telling me what buttons to push and such, i was just like uh huh yep got it... so he leaves and i'm like uhh i think i push this button to get started (luckily i was right) but i didnt know how to control the one fan... oh well. i think i burned myself but thats ok. Tanning helps me clear my head and think about things... i love it

-next i went to meijers and returned like 3 dollars worth of bottles and i felt like such a mom cause i had a shopping list my mom gave me so i could pick up some things... i feel so old grocery shopping by myself (tear) lol

-returned the movies my wonderful mom rented me for when i was home on meds for my mouth

-went to get gas and the guy there started hitting on me too (i dunno, sweats and a jacket and a ponytail i guess does it for me lol) welp i now have a full tank of gas in that mad-mom-mini-van i drive

"event","so i was studying for chem and was listening to a mixed cd from like a year ago and came across The Used... what a great band!

YAY for a snowday today!!!
got up at 11:45 to my mom telling me i had to get up and then she started making fun of me cause i sleep with a teddy bear... SO WHAT if i'm 16 and i sleep with a stuffed animal!! i will continue sleeping with a stuffed animal till i decide i dont want to! 
was supposed to go sledding but got up to little to late for that
went skating
did a lil studying... chem has gotten the worst of me


excited as ever for this weekend!
long weekends rock the world
theres nothing better than knowing you don't have school on a monday
...well theres a couple things that are better but don't feel like mentioning them


took my alg2 exam yesterday
i think i did well on it
i'm P/Oed that i didn't do one of the graphs tho
oh well i think i did fine

I LOVE the snow
even tho it took me and kait 45 min to get to school yesterday
and after school we went to Red Robin and i call my mom and told her we stopped cause the snow was so bad, so she asked where we stopped and i'm like Red Robin, she laughs and was like so you went past our house... yea it was funny(i know most of you don't find it funny, OH but it was!)
me and kait tried finding a parking lot to do donuts in but we couldnt :( booo


yesterday my mom tells me that if i had school today, that after she wanted me to go to dls and pick up my brothers yearbook... HAHA like i would go do that by myself


it amazes me that no matter how much your mood changes in a day theres always a song to fit it... music is one of the best things of life <Amen to that


i love people 
well most people
not everyone
its weird... i've always had this view that i have to like everyone and i should forgive everyone but i dunno... i've realized that i can't like everyone and not everyone will like me
thats life i suppose 
it's weird growing up


one last thing
Holly told me to be careful what i wish for
OHHH i am
good things come to those who wait :-)"

Arty n Holly- I LOVE YOU GIRLS!!!
and all my other girls that were there too!!

yup soo i had like 7 girls come over before the dance
first we went to cvs where me, arty, bre and holly bought ENERGY DRINKS!!! oo yes defnitly downed the 3/4 of the can. Was sooooo hyper. Some guys thought me and kt were drunk but im like nope just red bull!

the dance was great fun!
met some cool kids there and saw some cool kids i already knew
saw some assholes there too OF COURSE!

all in all tho it was great fun but my feet and legs hurt soo bad. 


* * *


got half of my short program done today at 7 in the am
who ever is up at that time of day by choice seriously has some mental problems... it is was to early


got home about 9 and my mom was staring at me and i was like
what are you staring at me for
she's like im looking at your eyes to see if your on drugs
i busted out laughing
she just walked away
i cant believe that my mom whose supposed to know me best (moms know best) thought i was on drugs
i told her that i was high... high on life ;)


yea then went to work
sams little sister had her party
it was cute
got a nice tip from that party
and then my other party only gave me 5 bucks :(
oohh well beggars can be choosers


* * *
yea so back to the topic on my brother, its sad that i cant even talk to my brother anymore cause the only person he is ever with is his goddamn gf
but my favorite part about this... i love how my brother can find time and money to buy like a million things for his gf for christmas yet i didnt get a bday present for my sweet 16 and i got a dvd for christmas that he prolly just went to best buy and was like the first dvd i see im getting.

i only have one thing to say...

you could slit my throat and with my one last breath i'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt


ok enough of this gay drama cause noone wants to hear about it
i know but i need to vent it somewhere

oh and also his gf but i guess thats not the point
i mean i didnt know that family meant nothing anymore... even tho i have never done anything to my brother... i just didnt know that someone so ""close"" to you could hate you so much
Seriously, i always say that ryan and me hate each other but really we just get on each others nerves. But then again its those you least expect to be there for you when you need it.

yea so new topic

watched a lil bit of nationals last night and i have to say that i have never seen sasha cohen skate so good. and YAY for Alex and Alissa who are rocking up senior nationals!!! Good Luck in long girls!!

went to school today but only for my first 4 classes :D
def got to skip the rest of school for an hour appt at the oral surgeon
surgerys on the 23 :( and its def costing my mom 280 dollars more because i told her im going under for this and im not just going to be given some numbing cream while they pull 4 of my teeth
i just hope i dont look too much like a chipmunk lol
i've already started a list of movies that i'm renting that weekend since im not going to be going out:(
lets see... alex and emma, how to deal, and view from the top are just a few on that list

after the appt my mom didnt make me go back to school which made me happy :)
actually she took me to the mall and i gots myself a new shirt and some warmup pants with a matching jacket
YAY for skipping school and going shopping!!

went skating
did some really good triple loops :)
yea def have to skate at 7 in the am tomorrow morning to get my short program done
i mean 7am... thats ridiculous!!
anyone who is up and moving at free will at 7am on a saturday morning is beyond crazy

hmmm boring night tonight
was supposed to start studying for those damn things my school calls exams but that didnt really happen
Oh well

i'm excited for the dls dance tomorrow night

sooo defnitly got locked out of my car today
well actually it was my moms and that was my problem...
you see to drive my moms car you have to have one key to open the door and one to start the car, well when i left i just took the one to start the car and since the car was open i forgot that i needed the other key
yup so i'm walking through the parking lot at the rink and i was all like ""aww mann i can't get into the car"" so i called mi madre and had to wait while this lady was screaming her head off at the hockey game that was going on... blahh


anywayyyss

ARIV43: eeeeevery time i smile its because u crossed my mind

>kait rememeber when we went to canada and got our ears pierced and i made a mix for that day... wow what great songs!!


""i'm so sick of being lonely
every night while my man
goes out with homies
i wanna know how it feels to be loved""
^field mob... sick of being lonely


""how did i ever let you slip away
never knowing i'd be singing this song some day
and now im sinking
sinking to rise no more
ever since you closed the door
if i could turn
turn back the hands of time
then my darling you'd
still be mine
...funny
funny how time goes by
and blessings are missed 
in the wink of an eye""
^ok i know he's a pedifiler and all but nonetheless still a good song by R. Kelly


and since im on the topic of pedifilers... i was driving today and this song comes on the radio so i go home and dl it because it has the funniest lyrics...

""she got a light skinned friend 
look like michael jackson
she got a dark skinned friend 
look like michael jackson""

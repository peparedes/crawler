I can't wait to come home tomorrow because I know it's God's will but the selfish part of me wants to stay here longer and stay away from the test and trials I am going to face back home. So this will probably be my last entry ever. Just pray for me, please guys. The power of prayer is unbreakable."

"event","God has me in Guatemala right now for a reason and so far His reasons are beyond my words. 

To the team that just got back home - I hope you had an awesome plane ride and I hope God works in your lives in the missionfield where you are. We have another team coming in on Wednesday (ALL boys + 1 older lady) and I hope that you will pray that God will prepare their hearts so He can change them just as he changed yours. Share your experience.

To everyone - God in Guatemala is amazing and everything so far has been amazing. Please pray for Steve and Robin Braun, the missionaries of Strong Tower Ministries that I am staying with, and Christina and I, the two summer ""interns."" I can't wait to tell yall how God has worked in my life and in this country when I get back!

Love to everyone back home -
Tori Wilkinson

P.S. I wrote this VERY long entry before the team got here (June 21) but then it didn't work and the internet got disconnected. =("

"event","I made the mistake of looking at old yearbooks tonight. I read old messages, looked at my drawings beside people and on people's faces, and thought about how different everything seems. I was a mean girl. And now I look back and ask myself - WHY? But it's too late to think about past actions. But is it too late to think about old friends? I mean... seriously... it would be nice if I could take one friend from one year to the next. Just one. But I change and grow and others change and grow and it always seems to be in opposite directions. ""How quickly we forget and how quickly things change."" I actually got that from Coach Hauck and if he's taught me one thing this year it is to remember that and soak all of my surroundings in - and don't treat anyone harshly. So that brings me to where we all are today... just think about yourself for a minute. How different you are, but how different you would be if you hadn't been through every obstacle in your life. God really is the Master of the Universe - He has planned every single second of your life. And we are all so lucky no matter what because we know God and we love Him, but most of all He loves us and God's grace is so amazing. So then why is the big clique of the Christian population so exclusive? If we have so much given to us and so much to share, why aren't his arms reaching? For real, WHY AREN'T HIS HANDS HEALING? Just reach out and touch someone - it doesn't have to be a non-Christian because Christians need your love as much as the next. But they understand it on a deeper level. I really do think it's ironic that the most unwelcoming people consider themselves devout Christians. And it's not just a cliche - it's in our church and most of all our school. 

Does anyone feel the way I feel? Has God planted the seed in anyone else to make a difference? My guess is that He has... you just have to let it grow."

"event","Tonight was too much fun! I went ice skating with the church. This time, I fell a lot! But i learned how to spin and falling was just out of fun - I didn't get hurt! haha this one time I fell from just standing up. While our group was up there, another church group came, from Heritage Hills I think. I saw Ashley and Claudia and Sam, but they left a lot earlier than us and came later. I don't really know what else to say accept that it was awesome! A much needed break from the stress school has put on me already. I hope everyone has a GREAT week - I probably won't be able to update for a while. Tell me if you had fun tonight -

"event","WOW - what a week! School is not the best thing I have done in my life, but I can't complain. This week was really busy though... I had something to do everynight along with TONS of homework for the first week back. And I guess teachers think we have nothing to do on weekends considering all the homework I have! Last night I went to Abbey's birthday party. It was really good! Had some good talks with Lyndsey and Margaret about expectations and life and such. It was like a walk down memory lane - except none of the memories they were talking about involved me - lol. Then we watched Abbey open presents and ate cake and ice cream (YUM!) and I had to come home to get sleep for the volleyball tournament I had today. I finally went to sleep and had to wake up at 6 to be at Chik-fil-a by 7. The tournament was at Oglethorpe University - very pretty buildings. We found our court and were complainging about it at first because it only had one court and we thought it was old - but if you looked at it, it was actually really pretty. It had like wooden arches and good lighting and it was really nice. After we finished our pool play (2-4) we had to go over to the other gym and it was like entering a HUGE play place at McDonalds. The floors were yellow and had all kinds of different colored lines on them - it was confusing! And there were TONS of people in there and when you were playing, you ears would ring because it was so loud. It was not good. We definately lost that game, so we were able to go home because the first teams in each seed were reffing and we didn't have to! I don't think I played horrible but there's always room for improvement. I really need to work on my passing and serving some. Hmm well church tomorrow! Ice skating - SUPER FUN! Hope everyone had an AWESOME week.

"event","This morning I woke up and went to church and I was SUPPOSED to meet Tabby but her alarm failed to wake her up! So I decided to just go to Sunday school but I feel like I am the only who ever says anything. 

Then I went with Paigey to pick up lemonade and over to the Roger's house for a while! After that, we headed over to the church again to play Ultimate Frisbee!! It was really alot of fun but I wasn't feeling too good so the competitive side in me stayed hidden. I love hanging out with the kids from the youth group - and Allyson came! So that was awesome. 

I went home and got really bored but Tabby invited me over to her house to spend the night so of course I am over here! We watched Wimbledon and it was a cute movie - we really liked it!!

After that, we did ljs!! I LOVE MINE! And Jimmy's is pretty awesome too. Now we are gonna update Tabby's, I think! Anyway, I'll update more tomorrow. BYE!

"event","I'm finally updating on my ""exciting"" past week!

Sunday: LONG drive to Arkansas, but I am so happy that I had music to keep me sane. After we got there, we went out to eat at Garfield's! We really need one of those around here.

Monday: Shopping at the smallest mall ever, but it was better than nothing! I really didn't spend too much money because I really want to go on a shopping spree at Maurice's. Then we went to eat at Leon's, which has the best hushpuppies and pretty good catfish too. 

Tuesday: I had to do chores for my grandpa. Then we drove to Little Rock to go shopping at a NICE mall and eat at Bennigan's. 

Wednesday: We drove to Camden to visit all my other relatives like cousins and great aunts and I dunno how these other people are related to me! All I know is that I can't remember all of their names and I just talk to the people I remember. 

Thursday: Nothing really - packed and DROVE SOME MORE to eat at this place called the Ice House, but I didn't think it was that good. 

Friday: CAME HOME! I got to drive some too, but I get really bored because there is nothing to look at around you. Anyway, I came home and took a shower and got ready to go to Jenna's house for the New Year's party! It was great fun. Then I went over to Tabby's house to spend the night and we watched Newlyweds and then tried to go to sleep! But we started laughing when I told Tabby about how I thought my arm pit hair had grown A LOT but it was fuzz from my sweater. tehehe! 

Today I am home and watching the bowl game. I'm bored! And I can't believe we go back to school on Tuesday. 

HAPPY NEW YEAR!"

Anyway, I went over to the Roger's again today! (My momma told me I should just move in...) Rachael came over there and we watched A Cinderella Story! I watched it last night too, but I got to see all of it today. I had lots of fun! It's so easy to make fun of that movie!!

My mom picked me up and we had to stop by Eckerd, then Target, and then we met my sister at the library so we could head to Stone Mountain! It was just a bit chilly when we got there and riding the train was even worse! They need to enclose those windows. The barn was my favorite place because it was warm and you could throw balls at everybody. We also watched the most ghetto laser show ever. But we found out my nephew is psychic! He predicted what song was gonna come on next. 

You know what? I have never had a nickname before besides Tori. And now people call me irot or tori irot or VAPO (that one hasn't caught on so much) or Tori Story! tehehe it makes me laugh.

Tabby is hopping! (she's a fighting frog!) HAHA! That was my highlight since I have been home."

"event","Yesterday was a lot of fun! Paige picked me up and took me to the church so I could go shopping with Tabby, Jay, and Anna for some families in Rockdale. tehehe - before we left, Jay and I went on a witch hunt and looked for a car in the ditch! We tried to fix the fence that is down, but it didn't work too well. I tried stepping on it - but that didn't work so well either! lol

Well we headed off and stopped by Chik-fil-a for lunch! Then we walked on over to Target to start shopping. We didn't find everything we needed so we went to TJ Maxx and Warehouse Music and Rack Room Shoes. ""NO MORE DORA! Ok, you can get that."" lol -

We made a stop by STARBUCKS - oh it was great! I was hot so I got a frappuccino, even though it was kinda cool outside. And Tabby hit me with the door! lol. Well we went to Aldi's too and I had never been in there before! You have to put a quarter in the buggy and then you swap buggies with your cashier and find out what new quarter you get back! lol - We got Indiana! Wow that was funny. 

When we got back to the church, we got to talk to Trey!!! Oh man, I miss him so much. It was good to talk to him - he is still with Heather! We took pictures of ourselves and sent them to him, but I talked to him again last night and he still hadn't gotten the e-mail! That's too bad because they were really cute! 

I had to come home and get ready for volleyball practice. We went to the gym at Elks, where we are supposed to practice, but somehow we got the wrong key and couldn't get in. Our coach for the regular season had to come to Heritage and open it for us to practice. We ran 30 minutes behind, so we had to practice 30 minutes longer. No fun! And the practices aren't even hard... it bothers me but I guess I need to learn how to have more fun.

I came home and talked to Jimmy and Tabby - but they both got tired and went to sleep! =(

Today I woke up and I started not to feel good. My head was pounding and my stomach was hurting. I threw up - gross! But I feel better. We are supposed to go to a scrimmage tonight for volleyball, but I don't think I will be able to go because I got sick. Even if I felt normal again my mom wouldn't let me. 

Sorry this is so long, but I don't have much else to do! I wish I could be wrapping and delivering the presents/food we bought yesterday. Oh well! Have a GREAT day."

This morning I went to church and came home and cleaned some more and just kinda relaxed... then I got kicked out a little after my mom's party started. I went to the junior high Christmas party at church, which started at 4:30... but I got there at 10 til 4! It was very enjoyable. 

Then the senior high party started! We started the Regressive dinner (dessert first, dinner last) at Abbey's house!! It's so pretty. I found out that I have known Abbey a lot longer than I thought. It's funny how things work themselves out!

Well, me, Jimmy, Tabby, Chad, and Jay rode in THE VUE on the way to the houses and we had a lot of fun! haha - I laid on top of everyone and appearantly I have a bony butt and a bony back! We went back to the church and played the ""dirty santa"" gift game... but people were being so immature and it lasted an hour! I had the same thing the whole time... and I didn't mind. Oh well. Once I FINALLY got home (we ran 45 minutes late...) I got online and we had our ""date"" chatroom! That was funny. We talked for almost two hours tonight!! Good stuff and good memories. Tonight was a much needed night for me. A time for relaxation and a time to let go. Thanks for everything.

After I finally woke up this morning, I had to help my momma chop up pecans and dust and some other stuff because she is her ""red head"" friends over tomorrow for a little Christmas party. They call themselves the red heads, yet none of them actually have natural red hair. They all die it! I think it's funny... and it's funny to see them get together. But tomorrow, I am basically gonna be in the way and I have no where to go... and no way to get to church! GRR! Well after I helped her and cleaned a little, we went to a neighbor's house for a Home Owner's Association party. Nobody in my neighborhood really ever sees me (cuz I am not home a lot!) so I got to meet people today. One lady thought I was in college and visiting for the holidays. Tehehe! People either think I look way older or younger than I really am. I told my mom today that I am 17, not 15. I just don't feel like I am 15 except for the fact that I cannot drive. I really really have to think about my age when someone asks me how old I am. Oh well! Then we headed out to do some shopping. We went to Lifeway, Bath and Body Works, Michael's, Old Navy, Kohl's, and then to eat at Subway. I think I ended up getting more for myself than for others, but I didn't ask for any of it! I picked out this really nice Bible that Santa Clause is gonna give me for Christmas. I am so excited! I have enough Bibles, but this one is gonna hold out for a long time. I got the present for the party tomorrow! I hope whoever gets it likes it because I had no clue what to get. My elbow was been hurting all day! It pops everytime I move it... my mom was making fun of me! I dunno what happened but I do know that it is driving me crazy. Church tomorrow! YAY! I feel like I haven't been in a while... although it's only been since Thursday. Well I think I might try to go to sleep. Who knows? Bye guys."

It's ok though, cuz I went back to sleep at 3, which isn't too bad, and I woke up about an hour. I fell asleep on the couch, but I got kicked off because my sister was coming over to clean carpets. Then I went in my room (I really love my room...) and slept for like an hour until I was told that I had to leave there too because my sister needed to clean carpets in there! My mom told me I could sleep in her bed (which is SO comfortable) so I went and climbed in and pet my kitty... but I couldn't go back to sleep. Sorry I missed ice skating last night! I will go one of these times, I promise! I really want to do something today because right now I feel so lazy and useless... and I felt like that yesterday as well! Sunday is church and the Christmas party!! YAY!! I need some ideas for a gift... I don't really want to get a gag gift because I think others are. So if you have any ideas, let me know! I hope everyone's exams went great! I finished with 2 B's... not so bad but I only wanted one. I guess it's better than the C I was gonna get! Algebra 2 is the hardest class I have ever taken in my life... 
Drama - I dunno... 96 or so
Literature - 89 - GRR!! I hope Ms. Howell just gives me the A
Latin - I dunno bout that one either, but I had to get a 52 or above to keep my A.
Chemistry - 92
Algebra 2 - 81! I got an 89 on that exam!! What now?
World History - 92
Video Production - 96

I'll do better next semester. I am determined. All A's. I want my GPA to say above a 3.7 or else..."

"event","This past weekend I was at my dad's house. I hadn't been over there in a LOOONG time, so it was really good to see everyone again! Well, when I go over there I stay upstairs, in the bonus room. Last night I turned on the radio to fall asleep to some music. In the middle of the night, the music was turned off. I saw someone walk across the bed and down the stairs (or into the attic - who knows?) So I figured whoever was up there turned off the radio. But, why would someone be up there? Anyway, today I asked my dad, step-mom, and step-brother if they know what happened to my radio in the middle of the night. They all looked at me like I was crazy! But I know someone had to turn it off... they even unplugged it! My dad's family is convinced that it was a spirit... a good spirit though. I dunno. I'm not saying I don't believe it, I just don't know. Tell me what you think!! Has this kind of thing happened to anyone else before? It kinda freaked me out. Anyway, that was the highlight of my weekend! Besides studying for my exams - ugh! Well, I hope everyone had an awesome weekend and have a great week. See ya later!

"event","WOW! I just wrote my last entry and stuff, right? Then I went upstairs and was reading my devotion book called Everything Counts. (It's just as great as a Call to Die - just shorter!) The subject of what I was reading relates so much to what I was just saying... So I am going to type it in here. 

""We are clay in the hands of God. We can allow others to pound and squish and press us into the forms that have been created for people since the beginning of time, OR we can allow the hands of the potter to mold us into HIS design."" - Steve Case

""So often we mar God's designed unfluence through us by our self-conscious effort to be consistent and useful. Jesus says that there is only one wat to develop spiritually, and that is concentration on God. 'Do not bother about being of use to others, believe in Me' - pay attention to the Source, and out of you will flow rivers of the living water."" -Oswald Chambers"

"event","High school is about changing and finding your true friends you allow you to be your true self... but please PLEASE do not conform to what you think your friends will accept... Be your own person! Be able to stand on your own. I'm talking to a particular person, but I bet they have no clue. That's ok thought because I think it's something that everyone should know. When are we gonna realize that high school is a part of living our life for God?"

"event","Why do I do this to myself? I know I am worth more - I KNOW it, but yet I still seem to dwell on the fact that I am not perfect. God is so much bigger than this, so much better... I will end up where He is calling, wherever that is. But this is affecting happiness, the person who I am supposed to be. It's beyond my understand...

I really love church. But Wednesday I was acting all weird - I didn't talk to the people I normally talk to, but I talked to people I don't usually talk to more. I think lately I have been more open to random people than just my closer friends... Right now I just need someone who can totally relate to me and help me carry all my burdens away to Jesus... I am strong enough on my own, but encouragement from others is always amazing as well.


I have started re-reading A Call to Die. That book is amazing... and I recommend it to every single person who wants to die their worldly sin. Reading it the first time helped me take that leap of faith I needed. It was encouragement in my journey of faith. And now, reading it for the second time, I can point out how far I have come and exactly what I need to do to make me stronger. I just need strength to make it through the day and accept my imperfections and my flaws, cuz I am who God made me. And God doesn't make mistakes. That's all on our part... but I'm not expected to be perfect either.

Well this entry has helped me a lot. Just to be able to express some of what I am feeling is a great relief. I am trying to completely eleminate sin and I can't do that, I have to accept myself for who I am and all the gifts that God has granted. I still have more days...

Ok, well if that was all beyond your comprehension, dont worry... because I think the only people who understand are me and God. I'M NOT PERFECT

""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ."" -- Romans 3:23-24

Set this place on fire
Send your spirit Savior
Rescue from the mire
Show you servant favor
Yesterday was the day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God
And yes our God He is a consuming fire
And the flames burn down deep in my soul
Yes our God, He is a consuming fire
He reaches inside and He melts down this cold heart of stone
Did you realize that inside of you there is a flame?
Did you really try to let it burn?"

"event","Verbal fast starts tomorrow! Thanks Anna - for stepping up and introducing this idea to us. I challenge everyone who has not heard about it to ask me and join in! It's only for one week out of your entire life... but hopefully you will take it longer. Anyway, I know it's really hard not to gossip or be negative. God gave us our mouths for the ingenious use of communication, but too often we use it for negative things. Here is some encouragement sent for GOD himself to help you throughout the week.

""Put away from you a deceitful mouth, and put perverse lips far from you."" Proverbs 4:24

""A perverse man sows strife, and a whisperer separates the best of friends."" Proverbs 16:28

""You shall not go about as a taleberaer among your people..."" Leviticus 16:19

""You shall not circulate a false report..."" Exodus 23:1

But there's good news...

""When there is no wood, the fire goes out; And where there is no talebearer, strife ceases."" Proverbs 26:20

So if we step up to not gossip, then maybe we can stop gossip for good! Big dream, but nothing is impossible with God!"

"event","Today was another good day! Not really for any particular reason... I am just happy right now! School was alright and all, then I had to go to a review for chemistry. And I actually think I learned something!! Super exciting. I hope I do well on the quiz now. I had to wait for a while on my momma to pick me up because she got stuck in traffic behind a bad wreck and they wouldn't let anyone through. She ended up taking a LONG detour. Oh well. I am just glad she didn't have to go back to work, with me with her!

I went to Zaxby's for dinner because we have nothing at the house! Then I came home, relaxed, played this game on the computer (which I never do...) Then I got ready to go ICE SKATING!

It was so much fun! I met a bunch of people up there - Lauren, Robert, Derek, Scoop, and Abby. Megan, Claire, Forrest, and Ross were up there too! I didn't know they were coming. Sorry if I forgot anyone. Anyway, Margaret and her friend Catherine came later! That was really when the fun started. Cuz Margaret laughs a lot and I was in a really goofy mood and wanted to laugh with someone! We had to clear the RINK (not ring) for them to clear the ice, then Abby and Lauren left. We skated a little longer and Robert, Derek, and Scoop left, then I left! I saw Anna and Kaitlyn up there. Well, it was a much needed night out. 

Tomorrow I get to work on homework and studying for school! And cleaning... fun stuff. 

I am really thirsty!

Leave a comment and tell me... your favorite Bible verse!

Lots of love,

Have a GREAT weekend!"

<P>Monday night was NAGOYA - half price, but still ended up being $14.60. HAHA - I paid with lots and lots of change! Good to get rid of it anyway. It was VERY fun and the little guy made me laugh (at first) after I was being so impatient. Sorry about that guys...</P>
<P>Tuesday we had a volleyball meeting. Turns out we're only going to have one team - that'll be one diverse team! But it will teach everyone to have more teamwork, I guess. My sister and neice and nephew came over to decorate the tree for Christmas. Justin's a really smart kid. </P>
<P>Wednesday was church! I always love it. I did homework til 5. boo! no fun. Everyone decided they were ready for a serious Synago... we'll see how that goes next week. I know some are ready. I KNOW they are - but then you have those who could be holding us back. But who knows - I know God does, and I will just let Him have complete control....</P>
<P>This morning I had to go get a check-up thing for my wisdom teeth. I was so happy to get checked into school, but it turns out I got there at 8:23 and they just told me to hurry to homeroom. GRR! So I didn't get to miss any of drama... and I had to memorize my monologue. I have it though - good thing I have a good short term memory when it comes to that stuff. I have so many tests next week already! I can tell it's going to be a pain... but hopefully I can get a lot done this weekend. </P>
<P>Those Arby wraps look just like the ones from Chik-fil-a. I had a salad from there for dinner! Very good. I haven't eaten at home much at all this week. </P>
<P>Well I hope everyone has had a good week and enjoys their friday! Leave me some comments about something... I dunno about what... SURPRISE ME! That'd be the best. </P>"

<P>I really love Sundays. Yesterday, I woke up and went to church, the 9:45 service, and listened to Robert's sermon. He's a really good preacher and we're really lucky to have him!</P>
<P>Then my mom headed out to Target to drop off some film and pick up my <STRONG>GUATEMALA PICTURES</STRONG>! I have been waiting for them for so long, so it was really nice to get them. Some of them didn't turn out too well, and some were of really funny things... but I think those were the ones taken by Tony and Maria when they stole my camera!</P>
<P>We went to go eat at Olive Garden while are pictures were being developed. It was <EM><STRONG>so</STRONG></EM> good. Hit the spot. We went to go pick up the pictures and I got some Starbucks! YUM.</P>
<P>I came home and finished most of my project. Goodness it has taken up too much time! Then I had to go to church to prepare for the Hanging of the Greens ceremony. (No, not the hanging of the Green family! haha - that was really funny!) Nobody really knew what they were doing during the ceremony, so it was funny! I thought it turned out well though. </P>
<P>Came home, finished details on my project, and I was actually able to get to sleep! But then of course I had to wake up and not be able to go back to sleep... I just want to be on a normal sleep schedule again.</P>
<P>I really like this song...</P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Well yesterday I helped cook turkeys at the church. I can't say it was very much fun, cuz I was still in pain from my wisdom teeth, but it was so much better than sitting around here! I got there at 6:30 and after we took the giblets and neck out of the turkey and stuck them in the oven, Jay, Tabby, and I changed the sign in the front of the church. I left around 9, went home, took a nap, and went out to lunch at Dynasty. Dynasty isn't my favorite restaurant, and on top of that, I could barely eat anything they had there!! Except for the egg drop soup, but that doesn't fill you up much.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>&nbsp;After lunch, I headed back to the church because we had to take the turkeys out and wrap them and wait for people to pick them up. Well Robert told me and Jay that we forgot to change the other side of the sign so we went to go change it and found a BUNCH of the letters missing from the storm that came through. While Jay, Caity, and Tabby looked for the letters on the side of the road, I repaired the letters on the sign. While we were out there it started to rain so I put my hood on my head and I had on a black sweatshirt... I know I looked like a criminal in front of the church! But oh well... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Today was a pretty good day too. I didn't feel good at first, which kinda stunk considering I had two crazy kids running around the house. Sometimes I claim them as my niece and nephew. Justin started not to feel good either and skipped out on our Thanksgiving lunch to watch the dog show in my mom's room. You could tell he didn't feel good though because he passed up sweet potatoe casserole! Gross to me, good to him. HAHA and my niece, I heard, made fun of me by putting grapes in her cheeks and saying, ""Now I look like Aunt Tori!"" Goodness that girl is too cute. I like how informal our Thanksgivings are. But sometimes I would like a sincere moment. My sister got mad at me (can't be a holiday here unless that happens) because I stayed home to work on a project due Monday instead of going to the movies. I don't even like the movies that much. Plus I don't feel good. And she has been hogging the computer ALL day playing this game so I haven't been able to do much work. Ok and I played some too. I did get some work done though! And I get to go to more museums tomorrow. ALL day long. I really wish I had time before now to get this done... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Thank you Caity and Tabby for doing my livejournal!! I LOVE it bunches and bunches! Didn't mean to stress you out on it though... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Well I hope everyone had a sentimental moment of THANKS today with their family and friends. I did get deep in thought about how just one single moment or action could change an entire life... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Have good shopping tomorrow! </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#663366>The senior high retreat was awesome! Especially when Allyson got there - I always know she understands me and it was great to talk to her even if it was about nothing. I loved hanging out with everyone else too! I hope the freshmen enjoyed their first senior high retreat - I remember mine! hahaha - <STRONG>JELLYFISH</STRONG>! Wow yes... that will definately be a walk to remember. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>So last night I went to MYF and I was in a group with mostly junior high... which I really LOVED because I don't talk to them as much as I should. And they are really funny kids! Talked to Bill a little about the weekend and other stuff too. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>After I got home, I wrote a much needed e-mail to a person who has played such a big part in my journey of faith... but i know i shouldn't expect an e-mail back. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>Well this morning I woke up and took a shower and it was time for me to get my wisdom teeth taken out! I was awake and stuff but I had to take this medicine an hour before my surgery and it made me so sleepy. I slept on the way over there cuz I was going to the office in Stockbridge. Well right before they called me back Martha showed up! The power in the office in Conyers had gone off for some unknown reason. Yeah, she was back in the room when they had the little oxygen thing over my face and the IV put in me and all that fun stuff... As soon as Dr. Brady came in to do my surgery I was asleep. The only thing I remember is him asking me if I had an allergies... I said only a minor one to dust and they said they would make sure not to give that to me. I slept all day and almost passed out. Kinda funny now that I think about it! And most of the people were right about your wisdom teeth... it doesn't hurt too bad and it is certainly nothing to be scared of. I hope I don't hurt too bad tomorrow because I really need to work on my project for Coach Hauck. And I have a test for Howell next Tuesday! Oh and a chemistry quiz... how crazy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>I definately can not go to sleep and my momma moved the couch because we are getting a new one tomorrow! <STRONG>YAY</STRONG>! It's very needed. We haven't had ours that long, but it wasn't new and it certainly doesn't look good. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>I just want to thank everyone for your prayers and stuff! All of my friends are the <STRONG>BEST</STRONG>! And thanks to the youth council and others for an awesome fall retreat! I can't wait til the spring. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366><STRONG>Love to everyone!</STRONG></FONT></P>

"event","Today was another good day! In drama we had to rectie our monologues just in front of the class, not in front of Mrs. Thorne, for 8 extra credit points. That is a lot! Mrs. Thorne is the one who makes me feel like I'm not very good, so today was not a big deal. Except someone else is doing my same monologues, but she is meaner than me! I just interpreted mine as a lady trying to get attention, not trying to yell at people. But i guess that's the beauty of monologues! In Howell's class I somehow convinced her to let me sit on the other side of the room because I was freezing and I kinda went to sleep. I didn't even have to beg her to let me move this time! It was exciting. I guess chemistry went by pretty fast! She just teaches us stuff and I act like I understand. I do kinda get this stuff though. I always like Coach Hauck's class. Today we learned a few things, but we reviewed for the rest of the period! We played this game and my team dominated, which is so unusual! But i got ONE extra credit point on the test! Plus a sucker cuz Lauren didn't want hers. Grr I have the ACT thing on Friday along with that Hauck test - It's gonna be one LOOONG day. After school today I went to church. I felt kinda bad because I did a lot of homework while I was there, but after I got done I talked to people. We had a big group Bible Study with a group and it went better than Synago usually does. Bill talked about me - which I totally wasn't expecting! Then I had to go to a volleyball meeting at Los Charros. I really needed to study instead of just sit there and talk so Stevi helped me! She is the best. Hehe Alyssa called me a nerd, but that's ok! I need an A in world history. Well i gotta go to sleep cuz I have breakfast club in the morning! And I still really need some friends. Caitlyn is my only one! Oh well. I guess she is good enough. tehehe! GO TO SLEEP CAITLYN!!"

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399 size=2>Alright guys, you're lucky! I've finally decided to let you into my life. This morning I told myself I was going to be in a GREAT mood all day long no matter what. This was partly because I was in a really bad mood last week! Well, being in a good mood solved my problems with some of my friends because I wasn't constantly being asked what was wrong with me or if I was mad at them. Am I ever mad at anyone? Ok, I can think of two people I get easily frustrated with, but I don't get mad! Silly kids. So in drama we started going over more of the ""16 keys to characterization"" but United Way had their ceremony so we got moved to the back of the theater. As Mrs. Ingle talked at the ceremony, I realized how much I missed going to FCY to hear her Word. Or more correctly... God's Word through her. I didn't do as bad as I thought I would on Ms. Howell's test, but I have basically given up on an A. Maybe I'll get like a 90! That would be amazing. Chemistry was boring except for lunch! After I finally talked Brooke into standing in line with me. I always like Coach Hauck's class, but today he gave us a cookie break! Randomness!! But I liked it. Well, after a good day at school, I got to go to Gold's! I like it so much there. Coach gave us our REAL workout plans, and they are harder than what we were doing, so I think I am going to be sore tomorrow. I can't do the bench pressing machines because of my weird weird disease (I have talked about it too much today!) I am really tempted to do some bench pressing though... maybe just once won't hurt. Ok, so after a nice workout, my mom and I stopped by Blockbuster to try and find a movie for extra credit for Hauck, but of course, they didn't have it! So I went on to youth council and I was like 10 minutes early! I didn't mind though cuz it was at Paigey's house. I ate SOO much! It was very delicious. I always like youth council meetings. It makes me feel good to be around those people and it gets my week going on a good start! Even though I barely have time to do homework when I get home. We talked about Guatemala a little. People said they would rather go somewhere that everyone could go together. They just don't get it, do they? It's not about the people you are around, it's about who you are doing it for! I think if they listened to God, they would feel drawn to the people Bill has chosen just like I have. I can't wait to go there! Even if I don't get to intern. But interning - WOW! I am just so impatient. I should be asleep right now but sleep hasn't hit me yet this week! I didn't expect to write this much, but like Caitlyn says, it just flows! Even if it is boring! tehehehe. Well, if you are reading this and you are my friend, tell me your livejournal user name so I can have come friends! Cuz right now I am looking pretty lonely. So tell me to add you! Or else... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=2>I hope all of you are able to fall asleep much easier than me and you don't catch the disease I caught from Caitlyn!!</FONT></P>

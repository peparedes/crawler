"event","<P>Tis I, Lotus Oh Mac. I have returned after a 3 year honey moon with my ""Boo"", ( As all you hip little teenagers would call your partner )&nbsp;Jason. We have gotten hitched in Indonesia. We also adopted a son, Tonbat. We are now living in Richmond, Virginia. We bought a home across the street from a country club, do not ask me why, It was Jason's idea. ( I love him ). I hope everyone had a nice holiday and I wish the best!</P>
<P>P.S.</P>
<P>If you are wondering what happened to the old house, and the barn. I sold it to a nice woman, Caterine. God Bless.</P>
<P>Hugs, Kisses, Peace.</P>

"event","Hello Journal! I have just purchased a new Computer. It is much better than my old. I have not updated because my old computer which is now being burned and i shall save the ashes. Today I took my cows to the slaughter house since they have succesfully breeded and had their fawns, and since they are useless I watched them be slaughtered. It was gruesome, yet beautiful. About Susan and I : i asked her to take my hand in marriage, she said no and we do not date anymore which has broken my heart. I have been reading in magazines, and came across ""Gay and Lesbian"" marriages. Maybe woman aren't my destiny, I am soul searching for a male partner. Susan and I had intercouse the night before i asked her to marry me. It was the most delightful thing in my life. But I do not understand why I would like to be gay. Please comment me, Lotus, and help me to find my true self. Thankyou for your time and consideration. Good Bye!

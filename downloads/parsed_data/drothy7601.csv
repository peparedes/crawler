"event","<p dir=""ltr"">So I did some research and apparently live journal decided only paid accounts can upload photos using the app. What a bunch of crap! I just think that was unnecessary for them to do that. Making it pretty much no fun to use the app doesn't make me want to buy it either. It's just not the kind of thing I wanna spend money on no matter what so in my opinion they really only encourage me to lot use this app at all. Boooo!!!</p>"

"event","<p dir=""ltr"">I thought I would go ahead & post these photos of my walk last week. We brought smokey to the airfield with us. We parked n our usual spot under the trees, sorta away from the crowd. Our friends were the only ones to interact with smokey which was the plan. Darrel, a good ole country boy, played with smokey & helped us cuz he understands that smokey needs to learn people aren't going to hurt him. Overall it was a real successful day & we were both proud of our buddy boos.

Lol he has his moments where he stays back with me, but he knows I don't like to break stride. <br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/74510/74510_original.jpg""></p><p>Some pretty weeds. I don't think the pic does them justice, they were spilling over the curbs. So tiny, pink & white, just dainty & pretty. <br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/74944/74944_original.jpg""></p><p>This was a Baby snake I picked up. Not on a walk but right by where I park behind the house. He was just flipping around like a fish outta water. Too neat. And when he would open his mouth, I assume to threaten me, I could feel his body expand in the sides. It was def a cool moment. And I released him n the shade of my lil garden & he went right down n the ground cover. </p><p>The next few photos I hope r not a repeat. These r from a walk around the airfield we fly/play at. <br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/75165/75165_original.jpg""></p><p>Above is the back side of the property. I love how the path seems in cased n nature. Tho I did get the creeps being alone & no dog this time.<br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/75492/75492_original.jpg""></p><p>This flower was every where.<br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/75538/75538_original.jpg""></p><p>I know it isn't much to look at but imagine the gentle breeze blowing all the tall grass & the leaves of the trees. It was very peaceful.<br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/75946/75946_original.jpg""></p><p>I honestly was taking a pic if what is all over these leaves. <br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drothy7601/2231426/76128/76128_original.jpg""></p><p>A small covered area that was pretty.

Notice how it says CAUTION & don't stop, but people usually walk past it, see us flying & stop just past it to watch. Lol it really is funny how little people pay attention & they should know it is dangerous. We might as well b flying lawn mowers. Duh! </p><p>Well, I just wanted to squeeze this n b4 I forgot again!

"event","Well, I&#39;ll start off by saying I stayed home today. &nbsp;Don&#39;t wanna say &quot;hookey&quot; so much as just felt bad enuff to stay home. &nbsp;I have allergies draining &amp; making my throat sore. &nbsp;I woke up coughing &amp; just would rather stay home with my baby. &nbsp;Though he is at work right now...go figure right?! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;Tony is usually off on MOnday&#39;s, but he was sick last week. &nbsp;Since he is booked up for the next few weeks, he squeezed some peeps in early before the shop opens or on his off days. &nbsp;But I digress...

I&#39;m actually on the puter so I can type better. &nbsp;I wanted to add in some of the to do&#39;s I got done a long time ago was I actually finished Naming &amp; tagging ALL of my Photos that are currently scanned in to my computer! &nbsp;Woot! &nbsp;I cleaned up my tags, got rid of some redundant ones &amp; made it all buttoned up and beautiful!

I&#39;ve went through our new Blu-ray movies (we recently made the jump &amp; bought a blu-ray player, but I think I told you guys that) and I claimed our Ultra-Violet versions where possible. &nbsp;Turns out this neat little options will be convenient for Tony to use for his clients as well. &nbsp;He likes to put movies on while they get tattooed. (^_^)

I also just went &amp; Officially bought our box set of Extended Edition Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray dvds. &nbsp;he he, yeah, I know I already own these movies, but now I have ALL the extended&#39;s plus on Blu-Ray. &nbsp;Woot! &nbsp;And I got an extra $5 off plus free shipping because they&#39;re having a 25th anniversary on wbshop.com. &nbsp;And don&#39;t you know this exact same boxed set is $99 at Best Buy?! &nbsp;Amazing huh?

Today I slept in...well, went BACK to bed &amp; slept in. &nbsp;Chilled this morning with Tony, caught up on all my LJ reading! (^_^) and then I went upstairs &amp; scrap booked 2 pages. &nbsp;tee hee! &nbsp;I see why this is so great too. &nbsp;It is so relaxing to scrap book. &nbsp;To just concentrate on the photos in front of you and get inspired for a layout &amp; then try to make it happen. &nbsp;Unfortunately the $5 set of tiny little square inks I bought is definitely a cheap ass set. &nbsp;I should have known. &nbsp;Some of them are so light you could probably only use them on white or light yellow paper. &nbsp;Pastels I guess. &nbsp;Oh well, you live &amp; learn &amp; I&#39;ll still use them when possible. &nbsp;This small scrap book helps cover my low experience with scrapbooking. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure by the time I get to the 3rd cousin my work will be much better &amp; I&#39;ll have more ideas under my belt. &nbsp;It really was a nice relaxing time tho...ahhhh! (^_^)

Now, I&#39;m uploading more music to Amazon cloud drive, I hope to make use of this free service because I usually buy my music thru Amazon, but the storage seems small for the &quot;free&quot; account so we&#39;ll see.

Next on my list of &quot;to dos&quot; is to finish Spring Cleaning the house. &nbsp;I know it is a little early, but if I get started now I&#39;ll be ready to work on the outdoors when the weather dries up. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have a lot I want to do. &nbsp;I want to buy that shelf to go over my sink, I want to repair some stripped screw holes over the stove. Clean the Door Frames &amp; light fixtures. &nbsp;Possibly more the dryer &amp; clean that squishy tube thing. &nbsp;(~_^) Don&#39;t you love my vocab words? &nbsp;And I still want to find some simple tie backs for my bedroom curtains. &nbsp;Remember in the old days when all you needed was a strip of fabric with a plastic circle on each end? &nbsp;And a tiny little hook to use, not a big ass hook that sticks 5 inches away from the wall. &nbsp;I have to squeeze past the window so I think the big ones I bought will be in the way.

THEN, the next fun things I want to do is go through my photo collection &amp; thin it out. &nbsp;There are tons of stupid pics that can be thrown out &amp; this will help with my new scrapbooking hobby. &nbsp;WHICH, I can&#39;t believe I almost forgot what I did on Saturday!! &nbsp;DUH! &nbsp;I went over to Tony&#39;s mom&#39;s house for Scrapbooking with her &amp; Peyton. &nbsp;At first I started going through pics looking for more, when I realized I had plenty considering I only average 2-3 pages the whole day &amp; thus I was wasting valuable daylight. &nbsp;I brought stuff to make banana splits for a snack &amp; some Rum to use to make the Mojito kit that Linda bought me for X-mas. &nbsp;Mojito&#39;s were okay, but I enjoyed drinking them from a wine glass. &nbsp;We talked more than scrapbooked! &nbsp;of COURSE! &nbsp;And then went to dinner at the Yellow Cactus. Mom &amp; Pop&#39;s favorite mexican place. &nbsp;Only that night they forgot us somehow so we were there over an hour. &nbsp;It ate up the rest of my evening so I went home after that. No banana splits. &nbsp;Mom said next time bring a snack we can munch while we scrap...good idea! &nbsp;duh! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;I got 2 pages done using 2 pics of monkeys from the zoo! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;But they turned out fun. &nbsp;Did I mention how I got a pack of scissors for $10? &nbsp;Well, everyone loved them too! &nbsp;I scored with that grab bag of die cuts from the zoo also. There were ALL &nbsp;KINDS of things in there!

Sunday Tony &amp; I relaxed. &nbsp;I cleaned the kitchen &amp; living room &amp; tried out the new vacuum on the stairs too! &nbsp;It has a long as reach for sure! &nbsp;The rest of the night we watched Twilight Breaking Dawn 2. &nbsp;I liked it. &nbsp;It ended the series pretty well. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over now though! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;And then we watched the Walking Dead. &nbsp;Only 3 epis left! &nbsp;I&#39;m obsessed!

Oh, also next up in my plans is...you know how I&#39;ve talked off &amp;on about joining Ancestry.com to finish researching my family tree? &nbsp;Well, I&#39;m going to use the DNA package to join! &nbsp;For $150 you get 6 months to ancestry.com plus a kit to do your dna swap that traces your maternal &amp; paternal heritage. &nbsp;I can&#39;t WAIT &amp; I think it is going to be too neat to see really where my DNA goes back to!

And its been fun dreaming of Ann&#39;s future visit down here to KY. &nbsp;I know we over talk things, but its fun to dream of what fun we&#39;ll have. &nbsp;Once we get the dogs settled, Oh, I can&#39;t WAIT to see Elliot and give him a hug! &nbsp;And I know I&#39;ve mentioned keeping KennE happy too. &nbsp;I think this is prolly more my concern than a bad reflection on Tony. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to make him sound bad. &nbsp;80% of the time the guys go to the field they all stand around &amp; talk &amp; the rest of the time watch other people fly. &nbsp;So KennE might actually enjoy that. &nbsp;I just don&#39;t think he would be able to fly, so I worry he would be bored &amp; Tony isn&#39;t good at noticing these things. &nbsp;But won&#39;t it be nice strolling through the gardens. &nbsp;Snapping pics gaLORE! and showing Elliot all the pretty things. &nbsp; Oh and I was also thinking of buying a new dog park permit for Smokey to try &amp; socialize him a little this summer in preparation. &nbsp;It is still in the idea phases since I don&#39;t know how much my schedule is going to be open. &nbsp;My plan is also to continue doing Yoga 3 times a week using the groupons they have. &nbsp;So if nothing else, my resolution is to walk Smokey much much more often!

Well, I&#39;m off to play some more! &nbsp;I love yous! &nbsp;Muah!

P.S. &nbsp;Oh Where oh Where has my Dee Dee gone?! Oh Where oh Where can she be? &nbsp;With her big brown eyes &amp; her hair cut short...oh where oh where-ere is sheeeee????!!! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;"

"event","Well, working working working for one thing. &nbsp;I can see the light at the end of the tunnel though, and that&#39;s all I have to say about that. &nbsp;Other than I&#39;ve been sorta pushed into more manager role than I care to. &nbsp;Now that Charles is gone, Dan is saying he wants to retire by the middle of the year too. &nbsp;That would leave Phil as owner &amp; me as the next in line manager. &nbsp;Ai Yi Yi! &nbsp;Cool &amp; Stressful at the same time. &nbsp;We&#39;re (Phil &amp; I) taking over more &amp; more. &nbsp;That part is great. &nbsp;Trouble is, I&#39;m having to jump into things without much &quot;training&quot; &amp; of course Kathy, Charles &amp; Dan have had these type of duties for so long they are un-organized &amp; that drives me nuts. So on top of still trying to recover from the Holidays...yes...still behind on orders &amp; waiting on products...I&#39;m also trying to upstart a new Boot website, train the new sales rep &amp; keep my duties up too. &nbsp;Whew!

So tonight I am stoked cuz I left the office at 6:30! &nbsp;Woo to the Hoo! &nbsp;I am loving the over time though.

On a slightly sad note, this past holiday season has really done something to me. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know what it has been this year, but not having my mom around has brought me down in a major way. &nbsp;I am feeling a little better now, after mucho talking &amp; talking with Tony, but to sum it up...I now Know or rather Recognize that I am exhibiting classic depression signs. &nbsp;I have been realizing it, but trying to ignore it. &nbsp;My temper has been real bad. &nbsp;My emotions of course have been on a teeter totter. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been overwhelmed at work &amp; with the holiday stress, lack of money, my keurig is acting weird, my garmin shit the bed (all fixable, but still...why can&#39;t you trust that spending $100 on something means it is quality made). &nbsp;It feels like all the negatives keep adding up &amp; it is REALLY HARD to be positive. &nbsp;But Tony has been absolutely wonderful. &nbsp;He has tried everything he can to cheer me up. &nbsp;Though we&#39;ve had several arguments over the past few months because of my emotions. &nbsp;I feel self conscience about it. &nbsp;I feel guilty about it. &nbsp;And at the same time, all you gotta do is get me started &amp; I&#39;m right down that road of anger &amp; emotion again. &nbsp;I recently watched something called the Cancer Report. on healthwyze.org. &nbsp;I read how even our own government has set up a system that...to sum up how I feel about it...I can&#39;t go to the damn store &amp; buy food without polluting my body &amp; my loved ones bodies with harmful chemicals that cause Cancer. &nbsp;And to top it off, Chemotherapy is a JOKE! &nbsp;There are more effective ways to fight cancer...ways that have 80% effectiveness which is leagues higher than chemo, but the doctors (look up Otto Warburg who won the Nobel for his discovery that cancer cells can&#39;t survive in an environment with a High PH) they&#39;ve all been run out of the country from death threats. &nbsp;It&#39;s actually illegal for someone to sell a product &amp; say it is good for you without getting approval from the FDA. &nbsp;And the FDA has gone on record that they will not approve any treatment unless it can be Patented &amp; it comes from a large, financially backed business. &nbsp;No individuals. &nbsp;No herbs. &nbsp;You can&#39;t Patent plants. &nbsp;So then they turn around &amp; BAN anything that competes with their synthetic drugs. &nbsp;

Ever hear of almonds? &nbsp;Well, you can&#39;t buy almonds in the U.S. unless they are pasteurized. &nbsp;That process removes all the B17 contained in the nut. &nbsp;This vitamin has been found to be wonderful for the body &amp; help fight cancer. &nbsp;Guess what vitamin I can&#39;t find at the grocery store? &nbsp;The list keeps going. &nbsp;Rockefeller funded all the major medical universities, which at the time were struggling for students &amp; money &amp; told them that he would fund their medical dept, but they had to eliminate all books (yes, they had book burnings) &amp; teachings of herbal remedies &amp; any natural treatments. &nbsp;Then began the propaganda to brain wash everyone to believe that herbal, natural remedies are &quot;quacks&quot;. &nbsp; Did you know that the most EFFECTIVE treatment for indigestion is not antacid, it is cider vinegar? &nbsp;Like a tablespoon I think. &nbsp;The stomach is actually churning &amp; over churning because it doesn&#39;t have enough acid, using ant-acids neutralizes what acid it does have &amp; then perpetuates the problem. &nbsp;And lastly I leave this part of my post with the fact that before Rockefeller &amp; before the 1930s an average of 1 in like 300 people got cancer. (I forget the exact numbers so if you want to know exactly you can visit that website) NOW 1 in every 4 men &amp; 1 in every 2 women will get cancer. &nbsp;

And Cancer CELLS are actually a normal part of cellular life. &nbsp;Cells can&#39;t breathe in an alkaline environment. &nbsp;Most people who have cancer have a PH of 4 or 5, you need 6 or 7 (or maybe it&#39;s over 7). &nbsp;Once your body ph drops so low your normal cells change into cancer cells because cancer can breath in this Oxygen poor environment. &nbsp;Of course this is bad for your overall body, but in normal ranges, your body continuously cleans cancer cells out like skin cells. &nbsp;But when the PH drops too low, your body can&#39;t keep up. &nbsp;It makes me think of becoming toxic. Only this toxicity if being fed to me against my will...or against my pocket book. &nbsp;So watching the video &amp; reading the article has, in a way, been driving me mad. &nbsp;What can I do to protect my family? &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to die of cancer! &nbsp;Why can&#39;t I just go to the store &amp; buy beef that doesn&#39;t have chemicals in it? &nbsp;OH wait...I just got back from Kroger &amp; bought some $5.99 lb Organic beef. &nbsp;And I discovered a new grocery store just opened up about 10 mins from my home. &nbsp;Earthfare.com is their site. &nbsp;Its a neat store, but it is pricey. &nbsp;Then I discovered Kroger has a new brand out called Simple Truth (if I remember correctly). &nbsp;So I&#39;m starting to calm down a little. &nbsp;The holidays are winding down. &nbsp;I&#39;m managing to go home a little earlier. &nbsp;My house looks a little better. &nbsp;And Tony and I have had some wonderful conversations. &nbsp;I just had to tell him how I feel inside. &nbsp;I&#39;m pissed off at my government for this &amp; oh so many reasons. &nbsp;I pissed off at the doctors that didn&#39;t take good enough care of my mom. &nbsp;I pissed that I didn&#39;t do enough research &amp; save her myself. &nbsp;Pissed Pissed Pissed! &nbsp;But I have found a compromise in my mind with the organic food. &nbsp;A balance between Kroger &amp; their organic variety, Walmart &amp; their affordable favorites &amp; Earthfare with coupons :). &nbsp;When we move I&#39;m going to invest in a under the sink water filter. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want flouride in my water any more either and I&#39;m trying to reduce sugar, especially refined sugars &amp; as much packaged foods as I can.

So aside from my mental instability lately, life is really great. &nbsp;It really is. &nbsp;I shouldn&#39;t complain about anything. &nbsp;Penny hasn&#39;t been feeling well lately. &nbsp;She has a sore on her booty. &nbsp;I&#39;m going scrapbooking at Tony&#39;s mom&#39;s with her &amp; Peyton this Saturday. &nbsp;And last Saturday I spent the whole day at my aunt Mary &amp; Uncle Glen&#39;s house. &nbsp;I&#39;ve missed them oodles too!

Now, I&#39;ve got the x-mas decorations down that were outside, but the tree &amp; everything inside is still up. lol. &nbsp;OH well, I don&#39;t care that much &amp; i&#39;m too busy to do it. &nbsp;Well, enough rambling. &nbsp;I hope I didn&#39;t bring you down with me, but I wanted to share my insides.

I love yous! &nbsp;Muah!"

I had fun getting my Christmas shopping started early. &nbsp;Tony did cut me off kinda early too when we realized um...yeah, we really don&#39;t have that much to spare on gifts like we thought. &nbsp;The holiday season set in &amp; as soon as Black Friday hit I did pretty much nothing but work work work &amp; try not to cry, scream &amp; cuss. &nbsp;lol &nbsp;I&#39;m glad all that is pretty much over now.

Tony has been getting more &amp; more steady work; which is great. &nbsp;More &amp; more regulars coming in, which is REALLY great. &nbsp;This one guy has been hookin us up Major with the candy &amp; its the best I&#39;ve seen in a LONG time! &nbsp;&amp; for practically nothing. &nbsp;We got Tony a new Airplane for X-mas, it was a good deal off a friend we really trusted so we couldn&#39;t pass it up. &nbsp;Let&#39;s see our inventory of vehicles is now as follows: T-Rex 600 Heli (too big for me), Blade 300X Heli (mine, but still too big for me just yet...I&#39;m ALMOST to where I can fly this one without having a heart attack.), (2) Blade MCPx&#39;s (his &amp; hers), Carbon Z Scimitar (fast plane) &amp; the new AJ Slick 52&quot; (trick plane). &nbsp;Plus our little ones like the Blade MQX Quad &amp; the little MSR we like to fly them around in the house. &nbsp;Tony also made his way to the hardware store FINALLY &amp; bought stuff to mount the big vehicles up on the wall. &nbsp;Seriously...try &quot;hanging out&quot; in a room that has 2 airplanes &amp; a big ass heli on the floor plus all our furniture. &nbsp;Now it feels like we have so much space in there! AND I can use the table again to do crafts..wrap presents, fill out cards that got mailed today..eh hem! (~_^) &nbsp;I didn&#39;t do Christmas cards to everyone this year, but I did FINALLY hook up lil Elliot today. &nbsp;Muah!

Let&#39;s see. &nbsp;My news has been pretty lame. &nbsp;The most exciting thing that&#39;s happened to me since vacation is having my back pain return. &nbsp;I think I slept wrong or something, but the same spot that has hurt before flaired up last week right before X-mas. &nbsp;It finally got so bad &amp; I was popping so many ibuprofens &amp; waking up EVERY night in pain at 3-5 am &amp; not being able to find a way to lay down &amp; sleep...which made me cry it hurt so bad &amp; I really just wanted to sleep so bad! &nbsp;So..I finally went to the DR ...well, I said screw that last lady I was talking to &amp; just went to the Urgent Care center. &nbsp;FINALLY a doctor ordered me an MRI which I had done on X-mas Eve. &nbsp;I still don&#39;t have the results back yet tho. &nbsp;I&#39;m just a tad scared its something serious.

Other than that, we changed Smokey &amp; Penny&#39;s food. &nbsp;I&#39;ve sworn off buying anything for them from China ever again. &nbsp;Mom &amp; Pop even bought all the dogs treats for X-mas &amp; they went Straight in the trash. &nbsp;They weren&#39;t in the box anymore (they mixed several kinds up in little bags) so I couldn&#39;t see what was in them or where they were from. &nbsp;Well, of course I didn&#39;t tell Mom &amp; Pop that. &nbsp;he he &nbsp;I&#39;m looking forward to an actual weekend ahead of me. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been working saturdays, but I get my saturday all to myself this week! &nbsp;Woo Hoo! &nbsp;Its supposed to snow tonight, but we&#39;ll see. &nbsp;It would be cool if Tony got snowed in with me.

Well, that&#39;s about all I have for now. &nbsp;I love you ladies &amp; I&#39;ll be back! &nbsp;Muah!"

"event","I haven&#39;t had an actual break other than lunch since I&#39;ve been back from vacation. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t downloaded the photos off the camera yet either. &nbsp;So let&#39;s see how well I can recap the most awesome vacation EVER!!!

Thursday: Packing Day. &nbsp;Tony was getting on my nerves a bit this day because you prolly know how I am. &nbsp;I asked ahead of time when he wanted to head out. &nbsp;We wanted to plan to be in Atlanta before morning rush hour on Friday Morning, so the plan was to leave around 11 or 12 at night. &nbsp;I had ALL day to pack, shower, do my nails (gotta get ready for the pool) take the dogs to the kennel &amp; clean up the house. &nbsp;I planned my day out based on this information, but for some reason, the closer to departure time we got, the more antsy Tony got and damned if rushing me out the door isn&#39;t one of the worst things someone can do to make me stressed out. &nbsp;I PLANNED this day out MoFo, BACK OFF!!! &nbsp;So While I was in the middle of packing...yes, I like to do this myself...I like being in control of this area &amp; making sure we have everything we need...Tony starts asking when we are taking the dogs to the kennel. &nbsp;The kennel closes at 6 pm, so I figured we take them at 5:30. &nbsp;Well, Tony was like he didn&#39;t want to wait til the last minute, but I didn&#39;t want to take them SOO early, but we went anyway, so I had to STOP packing, and start getting the dog food ready, which I made Tony help me with. &nbsp;I also think I packed too much food in Penny&#39;s baggies getting side tracked &amp; distracted. &nbsp;We packed up the food &amp; toys &amp; dogs in the car &amp; headed over to the kennel. &nbsp;So for me, I was already annoyed. &nbsp;There was a girl I had never met before at the counter, I tried to give her my speal on this is this food, this is their toys they can have right away, I was going to give her the scoop on how to leash Penny&#39;s easily and before I got hardly any of it out, she cut me off, said lets go ahead &amp; take them back....I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye, she just took them, I didn&#39;t want her to take Smokey I wanted Tony to...Smokey was excited &amp; jumping &amp; pulling so I said you might want to let him take Smokey while he&#39;s so excited and she was like &quot;why does he bite&quot; &nbsp;What the fuck are you talking about? &nbsp;Don&#39;t start this shit with me, is what was going through my head, &quot;No but I don&#39;t want him to pull you down because he is so excited right now...see how he is?&quot; is what I said, so Tony walked them back with her, I didn&#39;t get to go &amp; give Smokey &amp; Penny kisses, so now I&#39;m already feeling bummed out. &nbsp;Then I tried again to tell her about the dogs &amp; she wasn&#39;t &quot;typing&quot; what I was saying in the computer like she said she would, so I was just beside myself trying to just stay calm &amp; not cry. &nbsp;Then Tony said as soon as we got in the car, &quot;well, that will be the last time we use this place.&quot; cuz he didn&#39;t get good vibes either. &nbsp;And that made me mad because THEN he was all like...we&#39;ll have to do some research next time....mother fucker I DID research this place! &nbsp;And the other lady, who has been there every single other time I have come in to tour or ask questions, was super helpful, nice &amp; seemed great with the animals. &nbsp;So that sorta put a funk on my day...then we get home &amp; I realize I forgot to put Frontline on them &amp; I told Tony &#39;SEE!! I was rushing &amp; forgot to do it!&quot; :/ &nbsp;and not that I was in a bad mood...I was still excited for vacation....but feeling rushed, I wasn&#39;t enjoying my time preparing.

So we go home, I finish packing. &nbsp;We install the ink in the printer so we can print off our tickets. &nbsp;I prolly shouldn&#39;t have waited until the day we were leaving because my black in wasn&#39;t working at ALL, all the text was printing in light gray no matter what I did &amp; I was sucking up the ink I just spent a fortune on...and damned if these things don&#39;t start to pile up on me when I&#39;m trying to be calm, organized &amp; &quot;go with the flow&quot; as Tony says. &nbsp;Tawanya stopped by to pick up my house key so she could take care of Ki Ki while we were away. &nbsp;Then right before we were leaving, and piling Ki Ki up with food, Tony tried to change up where we set the food out....I was like...DUDE! &nbsp;I just told Tawanya I was going to leave everything she needed RIGHT HERE!! &nbsp;GOsh, when I got something taken care of I don&#39;t need a man to come in after me &amp; try to change everything. &nbsp;Bah!

But all in all, we loaded up the car with our bags, and a cooler that we later filled with water, snacks &amp; ice and we were on our way. &nbsp;I was excited at that point. &nbsp;It was so cool headed out on our vacation. &nbsp;Tony took the first leg of the journey and drove a really long time. &nbsp;I think we left between 10 &amp; 11 pm. &nbsp;I stayed up at first of course, then started reading my book to get sleepy &amp; had to make myself try to sleep so I could take over for Tony when he got tired. &nbsp;Somehow, when he woke me, I ended up getting the really steep hills in Tennessee...which if you&#39;ve driven through TN before you never forget this road...the downhill slope is so steep there are runaway truck lanes off to the side for the semi trucks. &nbsp;It&#39;s sorta freaky to me &amp; I was driving it at night time. &nbsp;(^_^) EEEkkk!! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;Then I got to Atlanta as the sun was coming up. &nbsp;It was beautiful seeing the city all lit up, we definitely were there just as traffic seemed to be picking up...so it was busy, but not too bad, but again I thought...how did I get this part of the drive! &nbsp;lol Damn my luck! (^_^) &nbsp;I bounced in my seat &amp; sang to the music &amp; laughed at the dj&#39;s.&nbsp;

And alas, my break is over, but that first day I just had to share the long version! &nbsp;lol &nbsp;Muah! &nbsp;Love YOu ladies!"

I couldn't help it.  The price was just too good to pass up!  I had errands to run anyway and the plan was to go to Lowe's next weekend to pick something out officially.  I had been shopping Lowe's website & I wanted to compare prices with what Walmart had in stock.  No of course this is probably not has ""high quality"" as what I had lined up at Lowe's, but for $98 I got both chairs & the table & the table is waaay bigger than what I had planned on getting.  I like that you can sit at it if you want and I can put a flower pot in the middle.<br /><br />If you look at the other pic you can see how it pops with the ground cover that I have in the flower bed.  Next, when it warms up enough, we'll tackle planting.  As it stands...yesterday when I bought this & put it together in the kitchen, by the time I was finished it was SNOWING!  What the Frak!?  The cushion's come off, btw, and the chairs are a lot more comfy than I expected once you sit down.  I look forward to some coffee out here and chill time with my boys & girl.<br /><br />Oooh, speaking of, I got home from Auntie sister day today and Tony fills me in on how the neighbor let her dogs out and the BIG WHITE one got loose or was just let out (though I have never seen her do that before with that dog...its a mean dog) and it came running over.  Tony was taking both our dogs out ON LEASH to go potty and that big ole white dog put his mouth on Penny!!  Only apparently HE got the bad end of that deal because she doesn't have any gashes on her, but Tony said she had had blood on her mouth and Katie came back to see if Penny was okay and said their dog had been bitten.  Tony said he went OFF yelling ""This is the LAST EFFIN TIME!!!"" over and over again.  He said if she doesn't get THAT then she's just a dumb bee-otch!  She got lucky our dog wasn't hurt.  If she had been, I don't know what I would have done!  Ai Yi Yi!  I am just glad nothing serious occurred.  Penny seems to have some bruising & tenderness if you touch her just right, but she's climbing the stairs & jumping on the furniture with no problems.  Whew!  But what a fiasco.<br /><br />Auntie Sister day was fun.  I effin GRUBBED this weekend.  Saturday, after my shopping spree, Tony got off work & he & I met some friends at Chuy's for din din.  Mmm MMm!  I had 2 margarita's!  (^_^)  Then today I had Shake N Bake Pork Chops, green beans, corn & Mac N Cheese at Auntie Sister day and then I had marinated Ribeye's for Tony's treat and we cooked those up for dinner tonight with some green beans and mashed potatoes.  Whew!  This girl is full!<br /><br />Well, I hope everyone had a super duper weekend & stayed warm.  There is still snow on parts of my patio!  <br /><br />Later TAters!  Muah!<br clear=""all"" />"

I fraking love my new hair cut.  I have lots of layers in the back that flip all over.  She didn't do much when she fixed it so I think I can recreate it.<br /><br />We've had an awesome day.  Got up & watched Face Off, seen that tv show? Its a special effects makeup reality show competition.  Very interesting.  They did alien makeup in the epi we watched.<br /><br />then we headed out to the mall & Tony dropped me off to get my hair did while he made a visit to the hobby store.  It took a lot longer than I expected for a haircut, but I fraking love it!<br /><br />After my haircut we headed over to Chuy's & had a most excellent lunch!  Spicy & I ate way more than I usually do.  Plus with a margarita & plenty o chips n salsa & this ranch jalepeno dip we went home miserably full to the gills!  We picked up A Team at the red box on the way home & we have it in nwo as I am updating.<br /><br />Oh and I almost forgot I gave Tony his Capt Phil Tee I bought him & he gave me some chocolate & some sugar (~_^). <br /><br />Its been another super day with the greatest man I know.  I hope you ladies enjoyed your weekend as well!  Muah!  C U later taters!<br /><br />Dot<br clear=""all"" />"

I took Smokey to the Vet at 4 for his shots.&nbsp; Stocked up on enough Frontline for the summer.&nbsp; Smokey was a REALLY good boy this time.&nbsp; I got him to sit in the madness too.&nbsp; Though I had to keep telling him to sit back down.

Um, lets skip ahead to thursday, yesterday.&nbsp; I got one of those wild cleaning hairs.&nbsp; whipped out my bucket &amp; sponge &amp; green cleaner and pulled out the chairs n stuff from Tony's section of the fun room.&nbsp; I wiped down the lamps, the closet doors &amp; vacuumed.&nbsp; Oh cause I FINALLY found some carpet fresh...I have been looking EVERYWHERE&nbsp;for it.&nbsp; I organized &amp; put things back and sadly I&nbsp;only finished one half the room.&nbsp; Oh and I did most of the laundry.

After that I gave Smokey a bath...he needed one badly &amp; whipped up some Meatloaf for dinner.&nbsp; I wanted to make a full batch since I&nbsp;usually make a half batch (1 lb).&nbsp; This turned out to be a mistake.&nbsp; I picked Tony up from work &amp;&nbsp;when we got hom I&nbsp;got started cooking.&nbsp; It was supposed to take an hour, but ended up taking 1.5 hours.&nbsp; I&nbsp;made homemade broccoli cheese casserole, home made mashed potatoes AND&nbsp;home made corn bread (Jiffy Mix).&nbsp; Everything was done before the meat loaf.&nbsp; And we ended up eating dinner last night at like 11:30.&nbsp; This morning, both of us (our stomachs) are paying for it.&nbsp; And I don't know how, but I&nbsp;talked myself into eating left overs for lunch.&nbsp; 

And what has been fun is replying to LJ&nbsp;posts today &amp; getting comments back from Ann.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have actually been on here catching up on my LJ since 12 noon.&nbsp; It is now 5:20.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; I&nbsp;love you bitches though!&nbsp; (~_^)

Well, I am off to salvage some part of my day.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am not sure what I'll do next.&nbsp; Maybe clean...maybe not.&nbsp; hmmms, maybe some CANDY!"

After din din we watched some boob tube.&nbsp; More playoffs, though I can't remember who won, we watched the celtics play.&nbsp; I crocheted another diamond.&nbsp; I thought I had enough of my skeen left, but ran out about 4 rows from the end, so I tied the new skeen to it.&nbsp; Though the color code is the same, there is a slight difference in color.&nbsp; I don't think you would notice if someone didn't point it out, but I am not surprised considering I started &amp; bought the original yarn almost 10 years ago.&nbsp; he he&nbsp; I am determined to get this thing done, I am just missing one color.&nbsp; But I want to check out their site, and surely you can buy yarn there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Feel free to comment if you want.  I am still exploring features in flickr.  I especially like this shot of the foot.  I just can't put my finger on it.  I really love this sewing machine.  It amazes me to look at its industrial features and the way it's constructed & how heavy it is.  To me at least, it seems like such a complicated machine, and yet I know my mom used it well.  Kinda like the tables are turned becuase usually mom is asking me how to use modern technology, and I would have to ask to be able to use that thing fo sho!  But since the wire is burnt I guess it will just be a nice box in my closet for a few years.  Someday when we have a nice house, I would like to have a craft room of my own and I think I would either restore it, or in the very least have it sitting out in all its metal glory!  lol<br /><br />Later Taters!<br clear=""all"" />"

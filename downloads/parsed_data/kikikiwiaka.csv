about LIFE?

how life began...where it is going now...

what you wanna do when you grow up...

who you want to be...

what your dreams mean...

how you're gonna make your dreams come true...

how do you even begin to imagine what's in store for you?

















how can anyone...
have five kids...
and then turn around...and leave them...

how could anyone leave a 13 year old son, an 11 year old daughter, an 8 year old son, a 5 year old son, and a 3 year old daughter...and say...it was ok...because they were older now...

how could that same person...get remarried to a woman who doesn't like kids?...but decides to marry a man who has had five of them...

and then...how could this person spend sooooo much time with this other person...that he forgets the importance of his children...

how can he lose sight...

of what's important in life..

family...friends...relationships with people...

is he really all that much happier now?

having moved away to petaluma...where the chickens are...and the turkeys land on the roof...where neighbors come asking you if you've seen their runaway cow, and where the mocking bird screams warcries at 2 in the morning...

is he really happy?  not seeing his children...only the youngest two of them, once a month?

is he happier now...living with this woman he's married...who does not identify with his children...as he doesn't identify with them either...?

how can he live with himself...knowing he has five children...he hardly knows anything about...

how can he keep oodles and oodles of money to himself...while his children earn their way through college, and their mother is forced to get a job

how can he live with himself...

how has he lost sight...of the importance of family?

he has lost his children

his five children...

and it doesn't even phase him...

because he denys it...

how can he not understand...

how he moved himself further and further away from those that loved him

and now...

i don't even miss him at all..."

"event","oh crushes...

they set off this internal energy inside you

they give you that warm fuzzy feeling

they distract you from everything you're trying to concentrate on

they drive you crazy

you want them to disappear...and yet...you don't..."

my brain is gonna ASPLODE!!!...

i dunno what to doooooo...

i feel for other people...i really do...

i want to make other people happy...i want to be there for other people...

when someone has been hurt...i want to be there for them...

i wish i could fix...everything...

when someone has been robbed of their childhood...

you can't give them those lost years back...

how do you fix that?

i wish...i could take away people's pains and sufferings...

i wish i could make things all better...

but i can't...

and it makes me feel bad....guilty...

i always think i can do something about it...

i can make it better someway...somehow...

i wish i could help people more...

but sometimes...

people have to just...help themselves...

i hate it when all logic says to do one thing

but your heart says to do the other...

""the greatest distance is from the mind to the heart""

sigh...

life right now is just...seemingly complicated...

i know it'll all turn out alright in the end...

i wish i knew what was going to happen now..."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2""><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">well thanks to three of my closest friends, im in quite a pickle.  two (A and B) have recently stopped talking and are not friends anymore, A and C haven't really been friends for quite some time, about a year or more over some stupid bullshit that they can't let go, and B thinks C is boring and doesn't like hanging out with him that much.  Im fucking sick of it, Im tired of being in the middle of all this immature garbage, Im glad I stayed in DeKalb and away from the clusterfuck thats called Oak Park.  Ive tried to mediate and keep everything together the best I could, but fuck it, they don't want to be friends anymore thats fine.  Im not going to rearrange my life, my schedule, or my agenda for this crap, Im not going to care anymore if I offend A B or C by making plans or hanging out with one of them and not the others.  I have better shit to do, some friends I have......"

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">Well I've had the best week I think I've ever had, lets recap shall we....

Wednesday started out normal, went to class, came home, played NHL with John all after noon, went out to dinner with Jessica then took a little nap.  Woke up around 830 and that's when the awesomeness started, we went over to Kevin and Murph's place to drink some beers and help Kev build the new bar.  The three of us were up all night, no power tools, no drawings, just good old fashioned handy work with a couple beers.  This time the bar actually stands and looks very nice.  I am very proud of the work we did and quite impressed too.  We finished at about 630 in the AM on thursday, went to McDonald's breakfast (which is always a delicious treat), then I came back here before class at 930.  I layed down for a bit but didn't really sleep, just kinda dozed for awhile, then Jess woke me up and made me go to class cuz I didn't really feel like it.  But I'm really happy I went, I haven't missed any classes yet this semester and don't plan on missing any anytime soon, my geography teacher also passed out a big packet of info for the semester long projects we have to do.  Sociology was interesting too, we're learning about different types of crime.  Ater class I came back, played a game of NHL with John then we went to drop off our lease aplications with Kevin and Slavistia for our townhouse next year, I'm really excited about that.  Then I went to the Campus Life Building and got a job.  Yea that's right Ryan got a job, its with the Stage Crew at the Holmes Student Center for shows and plays, its very flexible so that's good, I'm looking forward to it.  After that we just chilled here for awhile, went nextdoor to Brian's for a bit but I was just too tired and had class at 9 on friday so we came home and I passed right out.  Friday I went to class, aced my Italian quiz, then went and had some awesome PHB with Murph and Kevin, then it was off to Geneva with John to pick up Margita.  Went to dinner with Jessica, John and Margita and Markow and Jessica 3 at La Quinta, which is always good, good times.  Then it was off to Brian's for some drinkin, Mark D and Kapolnik were up here and it's always great fun when they come up.  Saturday I slept all day, literally, I didn't get up till 6 pm, it was great.  Then I made a nice dinner for Jessica, John, Margita and myself, it was nice.  After that it was off to Murph's party, I had a lot of fun working working the bar, I like doing that.  It was kinda shitty for Murph cuz he had to take care of a lot things and clean up some asshole's puke and his girlfriend was bein difficult, but whatever, it was still fun.  And now I'm here, writing this, about to take Margita back to Geneva.  Then I gotta help Kev clean the bus, Laing's bein a bitch about it parked outside, fuck them.  Then a trip to Fox Valley is in the works, so awesome, should be fun.  

I've had an awesome start to the semester and I hope it continues like this, things are goin real good......"

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">Well here we are, a brand new year is upon us and a chance to brush 2004 off our shoulders.  It was an ok year for me, ups and downs, but I learned a lot about myself and my friends.  

I rang in the new year with the only friends that stuck around at Chris's house, Mike and his friend Dan, who seemed pretty cool, Chris of course, and Jessica.  I'm glad i chose to go there instead of going to NIU, mostly because I'm going back out to DeKalb in a week and don't have much more time with my friends here.  I know I would have had fun out there but I had a great time with just a few buddies and Im really happy Jessica came.  Good times had by all......

I thank 2004 for being ok, especially the last few months which have been great, and I hope that will conitnue in 2005.

Happy New Year all........"

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">so im bored watching the election coverage...i told myself i wasn't going to watch it but ive been sucked in. i cast my vote earlier this morning.  I voted for John Kerry.  I honestly don't know much about where he stands, but I know what Georgie W Bush has done, and I don't want him to do anymore.  

I am just dumbfounded by the fact that so many people vote for Bush, I respect that, it's your choice, I just can't understand it.  I don't think people realize what he's done to this country.  I don't give two shits about Iraq when I talk about this, those sand coons are a completely different story.  Anyway, why would somebody vote for the man who's given tax breaks to the rich (who should be paying more), a man who in 4 years has produced the worst environmental record in history (4 more years of that...think about what will happen to your drinking water and the air you breathe in the next 4 years), a man who's reduced federal financial aid for students like me and those less fortunate who have a hard time affording school, a man who has outsourced jobs that ""American's don't want because they don't pay enough"" (fuck that I need a job to pay for food and rent and school and there don't seem to be that many out there for me, if we can't get the money for school we'll have to go to work....that is if the jobs haven't already been outsourced to Taiwan or whereever they go), a man who does not wish to give women the right to choose, even if they are raped, a man who ""fights for equlity""  yet does not wish to give gays their right to unite (how many of you would want to keep your child or loved one from their right to marry thier same sex partner if that's what they choose?), and let us not forget he fell off a Segway....the scooter type thing that is almost impossible to fall off.  

I see that Washington DC, the residence of the President, has voted 90-9 % against Bush....I find that very ironic for some reason.....

On the other hand, I am curious to see how much more he screws this great nation up in the next 4 years, then maybe we'll learn when we see this man royally fuck us all in the ass.......and not just automatically vote for the person from our party......


So thank you Bush voters, you have most certainly kicked this country in the balls for 4 more years............."

"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">well here I am...sunday night before labor day....at home....thinkin about how much I like being at school a lot more than I do here.  I've come to realize that, DeKalb may be a boring ass town but its been my home for at least 18 months out of the last 24.  that's where my home is, that's where I feel the most comfortable, that's where I'm turning into the person I'm going to be.  yea I like coming home and seeing all my friends but I don't feel as at home as I used to here.  I really feel a lot different when I'm around family, because in their eyes I'm just the same old Ryan, and in some ways I am, but in other ways I'm totally different than who I used to be, at least I think I am.  

I'm tired....peace out ya punk bitches....."

"event","First Night, for those who aren't privileged enough to live in Columbia, Missouri, is the annual New Year's Eve ""community celebration"" here.  You go around to the different churches and/or street corners and listen to local bands or watch cloggers or whoever, and then you go to the courthouse and wait for midnight and you scream and then you try to remember where you left your car.  

I attended First Night once, to usher in the year of our Lord 2002.  I would imagine I had fun, because when you're fourteen in this town there is nothing cooler than traipsing around downtown sans parental supervision.  Many a Twilight Festival was attended with this rationale in mind.  If I recall correctly, I went to First Night with people I haven't seen since junior high, including one girl who I think was fifteen and pregnant?  My only other recollection involves sitting on a bag of coffee beans in Lakota, a sub-par coffee shop for those involved in the downtown scene, and being dissatisfied with how the night was going.

Other New Years are even less memorable.  Conan O'Brien figures prominently in my catalog of New Years Past, as he always did a countdown for Midwesterners.  I was at a friend's house last year, and in Midway the year before, and probably at home with a bag of Cheeto's the years before that.  If tomorrow is anything like today, I won't have the energy to sift through a couple thousand people crowding into a thousand by two thousand foot space, and will probably enter 2006 at home again.  

Posterity has been, for me, the cause of some anxiety.  When I was younger, I was fairly obsessive about my childhood and every year of my life not being properly documented or sufficiently remembered.  There was a time when I saved pine needles from every Christmas tree; I took seeds from the yucca plant outside our Springfield house the day we moved; and once I tried to cut some whiskers off my favorite dog, so that when he died I could look back and remember him.  New Years was worrisome for my anxiety-ridden self, because I could never be sure I was welcoming in the New Year in the right place.  Obviously, I would need to remember my exact whereabouts at the beginning of 1997 for years to come, so New Years had to be planned in advance, and for a long time the idea of not being at home for such a momentous occasion warranted a queasy feeling in my stomach.  I'm over that particular issue now, though my need to always be able to remember has been replaced by other neuroses."

"event","They're making my favorite Webber musical, Sunset Boulevard, into a movie.  Glenn Close is doing Norma, which was lucky for the producers or whoever, since she's already done it (and really well, I think), and she's a legitimate Hollywood person.  I guess that's the only person they've cast, although there are rumors for Joe Gillis.  Some papers said Ewan MacGregor, which would make me die a little, so I was glad to find that that wasn't true.  Um...my pick would be John Barrowman, since he's been in other movie musicals (Delovely, The Producers) and has already done the show anyway.  Some lame people on the IMDb boards thought Emmy Rossum would be good for Betty, I suppose because of all the moxie she displays?  Downgrade.  I would pick Judy Kuhn, naturally, though she's been one of my favorite Broadway performers since I was fourteen or fifteen.

Anyway, I saw The Producers tonight.  I like Ulla more than I did when I had the cast recording and soundtrack, but Uma Thurman has kind of an off-putting air, doesn't she?  Will Ferrell was good, it just looked like they chose him because of his star capital, which I don't think was necessary, since they already lucked out with the original stars.  However: Roger Bart is awesome.  I hadn't forgotten (who can beat his Snoopy?) but I was glad that it was affirmed once again.

So the movie kind of reminded me of when I wanted to write musicals for a living.  I started a couple when I was about 14; I found the beginnings of my musicalization of The Great Gatsby when I was cleaning not long ago.  But those dreams, if I hadn't already given them up, would have been dashed this semester anyway.   Also I was informed that girls can't write good music, so I guess I dodged the bullet there, huh?"

- Raise GPA .2 (<i>I have no way of knowing if this happened</i>)
- Read 30 books, not for school, and keep track of them, eh? (<i>No chance.</i>)
- Actually attend mass at least twice a month (<i>Why would this even be on the list?  I attended mass once, and people almost died, so never again.</i>)
- Start practicing piano again, more diligently and with some sort of purpose (<i>That started up again this week, so, no.</i>
- Same with clarinet (<i>Maybe?</i>)
- Set alarms and not be lazy and late for school as much (<i>Yeah...no.</i>)
- Lose some amount of weight, so that it's at least noticeable. I hope an ARC membership will not be necessary. (<i>If this resolution was the exact opposite, it would be excellent and true.</i>)
- Work on those healthy thought processes, cuz those are kind of a problem for me at times. (<i>Maybe the one with the most success, huh?</i>)

Also, a meme that I thought I'd do again, because why not?  Name the movie!

1.  ""I have to return some videotapes.""

2.  ""I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist."" 

3.  ""Close your mouth please, Michael, we are not a codfish.""

4.  ""That's you, sir.""  ""Who, sir? Me, sir?""  ""Yes, sir.  You, sir.""

5.  ""They know about us. They watch us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.""

6.  ""I'm the best goddamned dancer at the American Ballet Academy.  Who the hell are you?""

7.  ""Nobody leaves this place without singing the blues.""

8.  ""I'd like to quit thinking of the present, like right now, as some minor, insignificant preamble to something else.""

9.  ""You're not thinking fourth dimensionally!"" 

10. ""The Devil and the Reindeer.  See, they both have horns, so they team up against Santa..."""

The concert in KC is a Tuesday.  I'm booked until 5:30 that day, but if I get my car between 3 and 4, and park in the Brady parking lot and get down there and on the road in minutes, I could arrive by eight, which is when the concert starts.  Granted, it's general admission, so I won't get a good spot, probably, but really just being there is the important part.  This is doable.  Of course, since it's general admission, I could probably wait a while to get my ticket.

"event","I just got back from an exhaustive trip to the mall.  There was one moment where, across the way from Aeropostale, I was cornered on all sides by people, walking very close to me.  My breathing became shallow, but thankfully my body guard broke apart quickly.  

Also: people can't drive.  I mean, I'm not the greatest driver, I'm better than some of my friends, but I wasn't taught very well, and also didn't get much of a drivers education from Cletus of A & B Driving School.  But really?  I'm gonna try not to talk on the phone and drive anymore, because wow, that's where people get crazy.  I was at this intersection, where the traffic on the street perpendicular to the road I was on, was really backed up.  But, instead of you know, seeing that lights go through a cycle and turn yellow eventually, meaning that other lights need to turn green, the people of Columbia (all of them, together) decided that they could just keep going, and when the traffic became backed up, they would just kind of sit in the middle of the intersection, so that those who needed to cross their street could actually not do that.  The second time this happened, a car in the turn lane next to me swiped around a couple of cars and just went straight anyway, apparently bumping the white explorer driven by the man talking on his headset.  When the other car went by him, the man looked at the car, looked at the light (green), looked at me, and quickly pulled out after the car in hot pursuit.  Good luck and Godspeed to the driver of the first car, I say.  

All in all, I was out for like, almost two hours, and I only almost died twice, so a red-letter day for me, I suppose.  

So far, no New Year's Resolutions to speak of, though I do have goals.  One of which, as I glance at the dusty Clavinova to my left, is to be able to play the piano without having a weird itch to cut my hands up.  I'm assuming my aversion to all things keyboard is just because of the embarrassing moments associated with my piano career, but in 2006 I hope I can overcome this and become a well-adjusted human being with a proficient grasp of the piano.

"event","So last time I got my haircut, a couple days later, the salon sends me a coupon and it's like from whoever, so I just figure that the girl who did my hair really well, and seemed to like me sent it to me cuz she's cool.  All today, I'm like, oh I'm getting my hair done after work, and that girl who did it last time is gonna do it again and it'll look awesome.  

FATE HAD OTHER PLANS.

Turns out: The woman who sent me the thing, and who I'd requested was NOT the cool lady, but was, in fact, the woman who'd done my hair poorly the first time I went to the place.  So here I was, asking for whoever, and she's like ""Here I am!"" and I was like ""Fucking shit, you are not the woman I wanted.""  And then she had a thing at like, six, so I felt bad asking for more cut off, so I guess I'll just have my mom do it?  I kind of feel bad about badmouthing her, since I didn't have my coupon b/c the lady I spoke to on the phone said it wouldn't apply, so she gave me 20% off.  So that was really really nice, but she still didn't really do the job I wanted.  I was thinking about this in there, cuz there was a lot of time to think, but I think I'll just have to start going to a new place, instead of going, and having the lady who did my hair today like, watch as I request someone else to do it, you know?  Or just see that I have an appointment with the other woman.  The things I do to avoid potential though improbable embarassing situations.


Work was okay.  It was really early, but after lunch I was really energetic and happy for about a half an hour.  So...next time: caffeine.  What else?  People were fairly nice.  I screwed up like, a million times, and everyone was okay with it.  Also, I must remember to keep the carts to one side of the aisle, because I think I was kind of annoying people.  I was whining to Matt a little bit at lunch, cuz I didn't think I could really do it for 18 more days, you know?  But maybe so.  My day went through a lot of ups and downs as far as my mood and my confidence.  I don't want to quit because then I'd never be able to speak of it again.  I really don't want to put anything bad down on my employment record for more jobs, because that would suck.  They'd be like -- so you worked one day?  And I'd be like, yeah, and I'd hang my head.

I forgot to tell all my internet fans that I had a dream where I went to see/was in the PotC II movie.  It was kind of awful.  The whole thing took place in this cave-themed waterslide (except for this part in a department store where this older man tried to hit on me by saying we went to the same high school and were also internet buddies), and Johnny Depp wasn't even in it until I discovered that it was him trying steal my wallet and a locket (which I eventually had to unclasp from his neck) and this statue that this <i>other</i> old man bought me in the waterslide gift shop.  Orlando Bloom was there, but he just kind of stood around, I think, because I don't recall him trying to assist me in anyway.  Keira Knightley wasn't there until I remembered that she should be, and then she kind of hung out in the background for a while.  As far as I can remember, it ended with Captain Jack in custody by the waterslide security guards.  Ooh, and in this particular waterslide, the waterslide could go backwards, and you would go backwards, too, since Pirates of the Caribbean defies gravity!

That was mosty for my own benefit, though I hope no one whose f-list I'm on really thought I was spoiling PotC II for them.

"event","I've been crying off and on for eight hours.

I'm not sure how to explain to others.  I took solace in TWoP because there, there are people just as invested in the show as I am.  I don't know how many people reading this are lucky enough to have something that inspires them to be a better person, that can provide this catharsis that is uncanny.  I think because it's television, my argument will lose some credibility.  This, I suppose, is to be expected in the face of the frivolity of reality TV and other trivial shows cancelled midseason.  It is commonly forgotten that television is intimate, and can touch us in ways we aren't even aware of.  

Someone remarked similarly on TWoP, that they didn't know how much Leo meant to them until now.  I suppose I realized that Leo was amazing sometime last year, though I remember beforehand thinking that Leo was my least favorite, that he had the least amount of appeal to me.  I think that changed when I realized the intricacies of the Leo-President Bartlet relationship.  I often admire the bonds between two men; relationships between two men are often depicted as having a sense of respect, dignity, and a quiet intimacy.  That of Leo and the President did as well, and what's more, it survived the complications of protocol.  For Leo, that election night in November of 1998 changed many things.  He could no longer call his best friend by his first name, for one.  In many scenes, if you watch, Leo puts on or buttons his jacket before stepping into the Oval.  But there are moments, where Leo must appeal to President Bartlet's humanity, must separate him from the office and title of the President of the United States.  Conversely, there are time when Leo acts to remind President Bartlet of his duty to the country, and how sometimes, his personal beliefs may need to be eclipsed by what is politically appropriate.  

Lots of people on the boards discussed how their families don't understand why they're so upset.  Luckily, my mom completely gets it, I think because she was so devastated at a young age when her favorite actor at the time, Pete Duel, killed himself, though I have a feeling that that incident had more to do with her crush on him than his ability to touch her.  Anyway, she's been really nice and supportive, and I think that's lucky for me.

Leo was the first thing you see in the pilot episode, by the way.  He started it all.  The opening sequence is him, walking through the chaos of the White House offices.  It's so odd to think that he'll never see the end of his series.  

Some of this evening was relatively normal for me.  I listened to some random Patton Oswald special on the computer, while playing Solitaire, since my internet was down.  I watched part of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and got understandably angry at the tragic joke that is President Bush.  It's just a few moments, maybe two or three times an hour, I would be getting apple juice, or walking around my house, and all of a sudden, I'll just be <i>enveloped</i> in this understanding that John Spencer is dead.  It's over as quickly as it comes, you know, I think because I start to analyze it too much.  It's just every once in a while, I'm just overwhelmed by the realization that this man is no longer gracing the world with his presence, and that those in his family, blood or not, are having a terrible time tonight.  I'm almost a little ashamed of my reaction, particularly since I never knew him; it seems to do an injustice to those who did, you know?  

My iTunes has a John Spencer playlist, right now.  Highlights include:

My Morning Jacket - I Will Sing You Songs
Ben Folds - Magic
Candide - Make Our Garden Grow
Rodger Miller - You Oughta Be Here With Me
Rosemary Clooney - I'll Be Seeing You
White Stripes - Truth Doesn't Make a Noise
Growing - Matt Caplan

I feel as though I've lost a dear uncle.  I don't know how to watch the DVDs now, knowing that he's dead.  It's hard enough to watch certain episodes, knowing the guy who plays Bruno is really a Republican.  John Spencer had class, and embodied, in his portrayal of Leo, many of the characteristics I too want, when I work in professional politics.  

I'm reminded of this quote from Candide.  The title character says it right before ""Make Our Garden Grow"", the finale.  I think Leo would agree with the sentiment, is all.

<i>No, we won't think noble because we're not noble. We won't live in beautiful harmony because there's no such thing in this world, nor should there be. We promise only to do our best, and live out our lives, dear God, that's all we can promise in truth.</i>"

I feel terribly foolish, crying over someone I didn't know.  I guess right now I'm just remembering all the times watching West Wing and wishing that I could have someone like Leo be my father figure.  Leo was so caring, and selfless, and he inspired loyalty in people, and you could tell from interviews and the DVDs and what-have-you that it wasn't just the writers, you know?  They've said a bunch that he was like a parent to all the people on the set, and knowing that Allison Janney and Janel Moloney, and Brad and Rob and Martin and everyone, that they're so sad tonight...it's heartbreaking.  I sat and cried when I watched Leo have a heart attack on TV, and now this has happened, I feel so let down by the way things have turned out.  

I remember this one time, I had a nightmare that there was a terrorist attack and Brad and his wife were killed, and I woke up just bawling, and I couldn't get back to sleep.  I just...there seemed to be so many indignities in the show over the past few seasons, not necessarily with Leo, just with the show, and you'd just assume that the original gang would be there to see it end in May.  

My sentiments are turning into anger with myself, because I can't articulate correctly how I feel about this, and what West Wing and all its characters mean to me.  It doesn't seem to be enough.  

My top John Spencer moments:

+ Bartlet For America
+ Noel, with the ""guy falls in a hole"" story for Josh
+ The pilot: ""he swerved to avoid a tree.""  ""What happened?""  ""He was unsuccessful.""
+ When Zoey was kidnapped, and it was up to Leo to tell the President, and he ran, on the portico of the White House, he ran to his best friend.
+ A Proportional Response: ""You can conquer the world, like Charlemagne, but you better be prepared to kill everyone and you better start with me because I will raise up an army and I will beat you.""
+ We Killed Yamamoto: When he has to convince the President that he was to kill Sharif, which he already knows.  And he's defiant and he's strong and he knows what's right and what has to be done.  ""This is justified.  This is required.""  ""Says who?""  ""Says me, Mr. President.""  

His smile could just brighten up a whole tv screen, huh?

Dude, let's take a moment and recap the last few minutes.

So I was sitting at my computer, and Tegan and Sara came on my iPod, and so I thought to myself ""Self, why don't I just check out their website, since I have ten hours until my last final,"" and I did.  And what did I find?  New tour dates!  And where do our friends Tegan and Sara go next month?  Well Kansas City!  Also Cleveland, but to go there I'd first have to figure out which state Ohio is.  So the happy news is that Tegan and Sara are coming back to Missouri.  The sadder news is that it's on the 22nd, which is a Tuesday, although I don't really care about, you know...school, so it's okay.  Also sad news but kind of okay news but still kind of sad news: they actually aren't headlining, Cake is...humph.  Not that I don't like Cake, they're grand.  They're actually probably the band I've consistently listened to for the longest amount of time, which would be about seven years?  But anyway, I've already decided that I'm going...I would probably only miss one class or so, and it would depend on my work schedule. Hrumph.  But they're coming back, which is so unacceptably exciting.  Hmm, I wonder if it's odd going from headlining on your own tour to playing second to last.  Anyway, I will be starting 2006 off correctly, as I will be seeing what is probably my favorite band right now -- again.  

With this, I return to my studies, happy-hearted."

I want nothing more than to sleep, though I think my grade in PS might have to take precedence.  

There was more that I wanted to write, but my mind keeps wandering, and I think sometimes it's enough, just to see your feelings in print, even if you delete them later.  Conversely, there are things I won't type here, even if I mean to delete it moments later.  I'm chalking it up to fear of tempting the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing...I guess I don't want to type something random, delete it, and post the entry, only to find that Ctrl+A makes all my secrets visible.  Or something.  That's the kind of random situation I'm worried about getting myself into.  Thus: things I can't type out...even here.  No matter how therapeutic/potentially disastrous it would be to see them in Courier New.

I like the idea of being in control of something, if only just so."

"event","I guess four down, two to go?

I finished my Spanish final in forty minutes, and enjoyed a trip to Panera Bread and, subsequently, an orange scone.  I bummed around at my house, then returned to get a few more hours in at work.  I bought new earbuds because my cute white iPod ones broke.  This way, at least, it will be less obvious that I have a cute pink mini iPod, with no foreseeable way to defend myself against muggery.

Tonight I'm hoping to get my CS grade up.  I studied most of the time at work, with a quick break to look at some EU stuff.  

I guess my PS should take the most time to study for, since I have like four chapters to read, and some outlines to do in preparation.  And two articles on the Common Foreign & Security Policy after Iraq.  Humbug.  I got about an hour and a half of sleep last night, and have been surviving off of caffeine for most of the day.  Maybe a quick nap before I have to go back to school for my CS final? Not that I really have time what with the shit I need to do for Poli Sci.  I guess if I take the test, then head to Pershing for Subway delights?  

Oh!  And I got forty dollars in cash today from book buyback.  I'll probably give it to my mom, right?  Since she bought my books in the first place?

I keep replaying in my mind something that I'm not even sure I heard.  I do not, in fact, enjoy living in my head, and then being relegated to whatever state I'm in.  It's disheartening, and that is the absolute best way to describe it.  I am disheartened by this turn of events that I'm surprised I didn't see coming.  Thus ends the cryptic section of my entry, and the entry proper, as well."

Calc final in four and a half hours. 

I haven't been able to shake this thing someone said to me on, like, Thursday.  I mean, it wasn't really mean, it was kind of a joke, but if I'd been younger, and they'd said that to me, I would have like, left the room.  I mean, I guess it bothered me because she called me on something I'm usually very self-conscious about, and this kind of random person brought it up when I wasn't feeling particularly apprehensive about it.  Anyway, I guess it's a lesson for me (""If you'd left a note, this guy would still have his arm!""), constant vigilance, huh?

I'm trying to acclimate myself to the idea that I'm not as smart as my mother thinks (re: wishes) I am.  I find it odd that my mother thinks I'm so smart, considering I'm sure she believes my emotional capabilities are zero and counting. 

I'm looking to move out, as evidenced by the apartment finder magazine next to computer here.  I'm not sure about my preferences about being alone, or even if I could live by myself (see above about emotional maturity).  I guess I'm scared about what people would think.  With or without roommates.

I was thinking about my grade in math while, like, brushing my teeth, or some shit, and realized that no, I cannot in fact have an A in math.  You see, if you care, that the point system as they're aligned with letter grades already have the 200 point final added in, and I was taking my current points and adding the points from the final later, which is, in fact, counting the final incorrectly and inflates my grade quite a bit.  So.  The test, like any test and quiz in that class, can, in fact, do nothing but lower my grade.  Excellent!

I guess if I have to retake, I'll do it over the summer, so I can keep up with the sequence.  Time to check out the retaking policy at school, huh?"

I guess it's not really a rant, but I'm nervous even articulating it, because somehow I guess that will make it a bigger problem.  I guess maybe if I don't externally acknowledge the issue, it doesn't exist.  

I guess it's not really an issue, since I'm obviously not doing anything about it, and the other person involved has no idea there's even a non-issue issue.  

I'm thinking this isn't worth talking about.  This was going to be an OMGPRIVATE entry, but since I didn't say anything, I guess it's okay to post.   

I rethought the conversation today so many times it almost seems surreal, like I just imagined it, and it can go away, can be untrue, just as easily as it can be true.  

This entry was longer, but I pared it down so it was postable.  I don't like private entries.  I especially don't like private entries in this context -- I would feel like I had something to be ashamed of, and I don't.  I would feel like I have things to hide, and I do, but if I'm going to hide them, I'm gonna hide them, and not post them on the internet, even if it's just for me to see."

I've finished my Theory project (Mckenney and I couldn't find a time to meet, but hopefully he'll take into account that I tried, albeit too late??), and the next Theory assignment, also due tomorrow, and I'm currently working on my Calc homework.  Guess what -- I worked out the math for my grade, and if I do well on the final, <b>I could have an A in Calc</b>.  I can't even believe it.  Now all that's left between me and that A is hours of studying and concentration.

Anyway, I'm optimistic, since I just calculated my grade for Theory, with some pretty conservative additions for the semester and final project, and I ended up with a B, so I think it should be okay?

I took a whole No-Doz(e) today in math, and another half like an hour ago, before I did my theory.  I was talking with some people at work about caffeine, and I said I knew I was addicted when I felt better about myself/happier/optimistic after I took a pill.  I guess that's not entirely true, because I knew I was addicted that year I tried to give up caffeine for Lent and died of headaches and stomachaches.  And that was 9th grade -- before I was introduced to the idea of alertness in pill form.  Ah, well.  When the drug eats away the lining of my stomach and intestines, I'll give you a call."

I was awoken today by my grandfather yelling at me, and the first thing I did when I got out of bed was run to my mom and cry because he is mean and I hate him.  There are times when he does exceptionally nice things for me but their effect is foiled because he just does them to get me to love him and that's a stupid reason to do anything.  

Anyway, I went back to bed after my mom and grandparents left and woke up at 9:30, when I flew to school and was only five minutes late for my 10:00, where I gave a stellar presentation on accession of Croatia to the European Union.  Then Tyler and I stayed after to listen to our teacher (a doctoral student, so not a professor) talk about Turkey, where she's from, and that lasted about forty minutes, so by then it was too late to walk all the way to Engineering and back for fifteen minutes of how to randomize circles and ellipses.  No band today, so I bummed around until Calc, then to Brady to study for the math test tomorrow.  Work was fun, we watched two of the required videos (one about advertising and media and one I'd already seen about feminism) and prepared for the Reclaiming Women's Crafts Night, which was excellent.  I made my mom's Christmas present, which was this lavendar knitted blob that's kind of shaped like Panama.  Then I got Chinese, which was a mistake, for, you know, health reasons.

The entire day was dampered by an evil sore throat.  

Oh, and last night I made this mistake of seeing Harry Potter instead of doing homework.  More about the movie later, I guess?  Or probably not, because I'd have to do an LJ cut and I'm way too lazy to look that up again.

My grandmother and mother are seeing the Rent movie today, and I think I'm going with them, because mainly of Anthony Rapp.  The other day on the View they showed a clip of Santa Fe and I had actually forgotten that song existed.  Also I think I'd forgotten about the title song, but that might have been just because I don't really like that song, and if they cut that one and ""Without You"", I wouldn't cry or anything (maybe a little).

I was up doing math until 4 am, and then when I woke up this afternoon I was in this weird state where I kept trying to take the derivatives of things like ""getting out of bed"".  Like, I would see the exponent going to the front, since the action is in parentheses, obviously."

Anyway, in an attempt to put off more math homework, I'm sifting through 34 pages of people commenting with more songs in list format.  I'm on page 24, and already I've seen, like, four versions of ""Can't Touch This"", three of ""One Week"", quite a few entries by the Talking Heads, a surprising number of the Three song from Schoolhouse Rock (though I assume most people are posting because of the Blind Melon version), and one of the Ducktales theme song, which reaches unacceptable levels of awesome.   And someone near the beginning did ""Annie Waits"", by Ben Folds...obviously because it's his most popular song?  Weird.  But awesome, because of the Ben Folds quantity.

Ooh! And I just found someone who broke down ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"".  Genius.

I've been pretty frank about it, and he's been rather candid about not respecting me or caring about things I want to do and lies he told me, so we're even in my book.

November twenty-fifth has always been a solid day.  I just feel like the words ""November"" and ""Twenty-fifth"" are individually strong, and when put together, have a firm base and a fortitude unlike many a date.  It is my grandfather's birthday...I guess he's...seventy-six today, and the calculator on my computer confirms it.  

This break has been disappointing.  I had planned so much of what would be done, I have a lot of studying to do before finals, which, in one class is going to determine whether I get a B or an A.  But alas, I forgot was lazy and sad, and I didn't do much.  Or if I did, the studying was accompanied by a Gilmore Girls marathon, so really nothing got done.

Oh, you want to do something?  Well, I'm busy/tired.  You shouldn't have waited until eleven o' clock to secure your plans for the evening.""

I'm sleeping more than I am comfortable with.  In fact, getting in bed is kind of uncomfortable.  I slept so much today...at least until noon, then a little more after lunch, then I got back in bed after dinner and woke up at ten.  I hope it'll all be out of my system by tomorrow, and I can resume a normal schedule filled with studying for finals.  I'm most excited about studying for math, and I can try and be optimistic about theory, but it'll just screw me with my pants on later, so I can't force myself to care.  I'm not sure why I just mentioned studying in regard to the two classes who don't weight the final, but I guess I'll end up studying where needed, and math and music theory are where it's needed.  

I've been thinking about this for a bit, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to try to transfer for fall 06.

About to work on my novel, I swear.  It was postponed today for reasons of NAP, but after working on my Christmas list a little, I think I'm ready to conquer the ""3,000 before I sleep"" rule.  

This year, like all others, I'm thankful that my family is not one that enjoys each others' company enough to want to be together for the holidays.

Nothing terribly new to discuss.  I'm running out of random shit to put in my novel.  Lisa came back to do a story on the administration, and she found out about Ainsley's crush on Sam, but when she told Sam, it was revealed that Sam was really in love with Josh, because who isn't, really.  In a brilliant word padding device, Lisa audiotaped her conversation with Sam and played it back for him, allowing me to copy and paste and double the word count there.  Genius, I am.

My favorite thing about my Nanovel is that between the bits of ridiculousness, there are, in fact, parts of dialogue or whatever that are almost valid and possibly-if-you-squint-your-eyes-and-look-sideways, canon."

Nothing bad, and really not too much bad can come of it, but naturally I rethink all my decisions.  

I guess I'll just be upset if it turns out I don't know myself at all (I guess that means a couple different things, huh?)

I guess finishing that lab is in order, then math homework, hmm, then...NanoWriMo?  Ooh, here's my new word count:

"event","Things I don't have Patience for:

a. people who feel the need to quantify everything.  I like matters to be as empirical as anyone, but people who need to make lists of People I Am Better Than is an awesome coping skill. Not.

b. people who can't take care of themselves.  I mean really.  I have a lot of pride, I'll be the first to admit it, but really, refusing help or refusing to change your ways when they're obviously in need of drastic change is just dumb.

c. voice leading reduction, because you never need it, it doesn't help you understand the world, it's just an unnecessary exercise in futility.  And maybe if you want your students to know how to do it, you should teach them how to, you know, do it.

d. people who define themselves by one faculty.  Really?  It's different when you're young, or in junior high or something, but to really cling to one ability or characteristic, and using that trait to identify yourself isn't smart.

I roll my eyes at you, if you fit any or all of these descriptions.  YOU win my respect."

I'm bored with my novel.  A scene that I thought was going to be really exciting, between Josh's mom and Donna's parents in the Mural room, is decidedly not so.  A scene that I thought would eventually lead to Josh/Toby fisticuffs has, as yet, not.  Charlie however, enjoys thinking.  Especially when the amount of thinking he does is disproportionate to the time he has to think.  Ex:  He goes on for a page about random stuff, while taking a fifteen/twenty second walk down the hall.   

Editing is for December, hey?  

Anyway, I should get off the computer, and be, instead, bored with Calc homework.  I can't decide if I have more drive to work on Calc, now that I know I'm continuing on with Calc 2.  Oh, and I also so need to finish my lab, which I'm still confused on.  I really want to prove the bubble sort, though I'm tempted to just copy and paste from the slides and be done with it.  

I'm currently on my first caffeine pill of NanoWriMo, which I guess explains the 2000 words I've written since I woke up this afternoon.  It also explains my knee shaking erratically, though it tends to do that regardless of caffeine intake.  

After the concert last night, I was hungry, so I went to Hyvee.  I bought a 24 pack of Pepsi, since we were out, and a think of four croissants, and a thing of cream cheese brownies, which I was excited about, but which proved to not be as delightful as I had hoped.  Ah well.

Wow, ramble much?  Um...not particularly excited about work on Monday.  This is only the second awkward thing that happened this semester that makes me not want to come back.  So..two in three months ain't half bad.  I actually think it won't be mentioned, I'm just worried about asking for a recommendation now.  Yeah, I'm not sure if it's really that severe, I just don't want to risk it.  Ya know?  Cuz I don't know how well they know me, and I'm not sure what people think of me, though one girl swears everyone likes me.  People that nice make me suspicious, though.  

I have a sore throat, and I wish I drank beverages other than pepsi and propel.  Particularly since I'm not that into Propel right now, as the taste is reminding me of a not good incident I had with a fly a few days ago.  

Alright, done."

"event","Went to the Bright Eyes show tonight.  It was really very good.  He played some older stuff, and only two, maybe three from ""I'm Wide Awake"".  He had a large band, and talked quite a bit more than I expected.  I also learned that there are quite a few young women in the Central Missouri area who would allow Conor to take them ""anywhere he wanted"".  The jury's still out on whether or not that includes skull-fucking.

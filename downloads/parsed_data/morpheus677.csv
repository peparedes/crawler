"event","Well, I'm not so much physically sick as I am... I dunno mentally. So, I decided to take a mental health day. Since I am so bored I figured I'd update the old livejournal, I haven't written in forever. I'm trying to write a song to the tune of one of our songs, ""not slutbucket"" is what the tune is called, I'm putting ""horror"" lyrics to it since we havent really decided if we're gonna be a horror band or not, but all of our good songs are ""horror"" so I decided to follow the trend. Anyway thats enough ramblin'. I thought I'd keep you fuckers on your toes with this next comment. Don't hate people for ""not having morals"". Everyone has a set of morals, u know minus Ol' Jeff Dahmer, but if people didnt come ingrained with the two basic morals Don't Kill being the one that hopefully all of us will never break but the second more breakable one is ""Don't hurt people"" this one is malleable but there all the same. All the other ones are influential based on upbringing and society, so count the first two above all. 

     WOW! that sounds bad I'm gonna post it anyway just because it was a brainwave that I just had to get out. 

So I'll see you salty dogs later.

"event","Hey kids, since I never update I think ill make this psudo-long. Well, i can't think of anything to write about right now so im going to ask some questions. 1st question, what is a word for a word being inserted into another word? I.E absofuckingloutely. I've been trying to think of one, but if any of you fuckers can figure out a good word im all ears. YAY time for a sappy question Sappy question #2 What is your defineition of love? I've been thinking about this and im on the fence about its being. For the longest time and sometimes now i think/thought that love was the feeling you got that no matter what happened if you were with the person you loved you would be content (sappy right? yeah i know), and sometimes I think love is just a reason for people to act stupid and do stupid shit like kill themselves.Im on the fence on my first definiton but the second is usually true in life but once in a while you get the former and usually one of theses people are senile. So thats enough teen ""drama"" as so many of you like to call it, for this entry.Question numero trois, So how do people discribe themselves? if any of you salty bastards have read this far then comment with three things that are favorable about you and two that you hate about yourselves.This seems like it sould be a gay hour convo but u know im just weird like that!>>>>

I should be happy, but for some reason I'm not mabey because I'm tired mabey cuz i'm sore mabey because i'm in school. but i dont think so. i dunno why. i have a whole list of things to be happy about and at the top of that list is Christy.

"event","So the show on saturday was awesome but it was kinda weird that there was only like at most 8-10 people moshing at a time so it was kind weird but it was a kinda vicious pit.Rugby was good too no tackling yet (lotsa newcomers to the sport) but its cool we did a little bit of the scrum i forgot how homo-erotic it was.

     Time for the bitching part of the lj entry <marquee> HAHAHAHA BITCHES </marquee> so im not so sure what to bitch about. (Minor Threat just came on) So this fucking stright edge business i really think it is jsut for people who are weak if you dont wanna fuck or drink then dont but you dont have to but dont draw big fucking <font size=6> X <font size=3> on your hand and put a two <font size=6> Xx <font size=3> on the front of your screen name just because you are a part of a ""youth movement"" jesus i think sXe (wow that fucking pisses me off that little sXe thing) people are just doing because they either 1. want attention 2. are way too self righteous 3. are too weak just to do what they want i.e. i dont wanna drink but i might have the urge one time but i have to deny all of my impulses all the time WOW i am such a <marquee> PUNK ROCK and/or CHRISTIAN and/or EMO BITCH </marquee> so i conclusion <font size=5> do what you want but dont be a fucking dumbass sXeER!!!"

All of you guys have to tell her why, kate has somthing that no one else has i dont know what it is but you guys miss something truly special by shunning her. Yeah I'm not going to lie i like her and me and her would never work out but she still is a great lovable and caring person so cut her some slack. please."

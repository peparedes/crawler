Evan got me this kickass Hello Kitty hat that.. doesn't fit. Evan is so awesome. ARGH. I love it SOOO MUCH. Hat = da bomb. Megz got me lotion, knee socks, jelly bracelets. && Ally gave me a bag of candy.

I got Andy Jackass, Bethany a revolver pillow and sweatband (I'm SO over you), Ally pants & shoelaces, Megan a boombox pillow with matching..thingy, Kenz a shirt & belts. Colti a shirt, Evan a shirt.

Dunno if I should give them to him or not, could be throwing gas on the fire.

I went to Harry Potter this fine evening with Miss Megan Carlson. And like, a half hour before the movie was done some bitches cellphone kept rining that was sitting next to me. So to be a good citizen, I opened my cell and double checked to see if my phone was on vibrate. Now, all the sudden I feel a pushing on my seat, so me & Megan turn around and this broad goes, ""Turn your FUCKING CELLPHONE OFF."" I was like.. ""It's on vibrate, bitch.""

Seriously. It was so funny. So then I kept my phone open for a few more minutes and played with it just to be a bitch. Hand in hand, the movie was okay but yeah. Then after the movie we bumped into Andrew Waters, T.A. and a few others kid I knew from school.

Then when I was standing there, that same lady pushed past me and said, ""EXCUSE ME."" And I was like, ""Bitch."" I mean, she's like 45. For one, why is she at Harry Potter? And for two, she shouldn't be yelling and being immature like that. RIGHT? Right.

I also got my picture back today. They didn't turn out very good, a few did but I wasn't satisfied. People can't take pictures. Parker took one of me, Kenzie, Bethany, and Rachel but it cuts off at our chins. lmao. A good one that turned out is the one of me & Robbers. I love it. I'll scan a few of them when I fix my scanner. I have the Rob one on here though, thanks to the power of my cellphone.

OTHER THAN THAT. I have to jet, cause Andy-poo wants me to call him. omgzz. L8er, g8ers."

We need to do that shit again. Not the cop part, but the rest would be okay. Maybe next time we can get caught making out in the woods. NOW THAT would be hilarious. ""STOP, police!""

If you're wondering Emily, I went to Andy's house and people were throwing eggs and rocks and stuff at cars for fun, and the police thought we were doing it and got busted. So it pretty much sucked. I ran back to Andy's house, tracked mud on the nice carpet, and the po-po saw me I think. So we got questioned and stuff, but we got off the hook. Thank the HEAVENS.

Who had fun last night? Anyone? ..Cause I did. WOO-HOO. Alright, I saw Saw II with John & nobody else. Andy is really sick still (haha) and the movie was awesome/twisted like that last one. I still like Domino better though. Have you ever been to rottentomatoes.com? It's a movie rating site with critics and shit. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. Screw em'.

Then after the movie John played this boat game in the arcade and I was laughing so hard. He gets super into it and puckers his face up, it's hilarious. Oh my. Then we had to wait for my mom, since she was late as usual. She had to sneak out of the theater, since she had to drop Brittany off at work. If she got caught, we would have got kicked out. It being rated R and all. Then after she picked us up, we went to Greenwood 'Carnival'. Kenzie, Bethany, Evan, Colton (who ditched us) Zach, Derick, and Tess were there. And a few people I didn't know. I met Derick and Chris for the first time so yay.

Hmm. John and Derick got their hair done 'wacky style', that was hilarious. John had a moehawk and it was red and blue. And Derick looked like a greaser/dalmation. Ahahaha. The rest of the night was just screaming, piggy back rides, candy, pole dancing, and all that good stuff. It was fun, so yayzz. Then I got a ride home with Derick & John. And that's the END.

AND MY PICTURES. Yeah, they turned out hot. Like 5 of them didn't turn out though. So ): But uh, I need to bring another camera because in my pictures it is practically all the same people. Andy, Bethany, Kenzie, Evan, Bethany P. And me of course, because I'm so sexy.

I was getting so excited for Friday (tomorrow) then Andy goes and gets sick. My luck, hmm? Maybe magically he will like.. get better and his mom will let him prance off to school & Saw II. Otherwise it's just me & John, or not going at all. Not sure if John would go with just me. I dunno. Of course the first person to offer to bring me is Mom. I feel bad not wanting to go with her, but I just want to go with my friends. So yeah.

Anyway, I did my band-aid project. It's really sexy, it's the best paper I've ever written. Besides my Trip Story, which I got a B+ on. Actually, I got an A on my story, it is just that my map sucks hardcore. Haha. My map skillzz aren't l337. And.. I'm really tried. Nothing else went on today, I am EXCITED for my pictures to be devolped though. I am like ""omgz, yay. picturezz!"" YESSS. I could dance. I got really good ones, too. Also.. Max broke a pink bracelet. He wishes, hmm? Along with every other guy who has been caught looking at my second 'pair of eyes'. Pretty sad.

HALLOWEEN IS COMING, MY BITCHES. I will be so sexy, you'll be blinded. And. I talked to Betsy today. So I'm like, 'Yay!'. That's all for now. Let's hope Andy gets better, poor baby. Haha. And I think I'm going to buy that ringtone. I want it really bad. GO AKON/YOUNG JEEZY!

Yes, it is my birthday. I had a grr-eat day at school today. Like frosted flakes. I got a candy bar. YES. A LIMITED EDITION candy bar from Andy. And a birthday card from Kenzie-poo, and I got sang to in Social Studies. And somewhat in Math. And then Andy wrote, ""Happy Birthday Austin!"" On the math board. Yay. OH YEAH. And I freaking remembered for once, and I brought a camera. I got some great pictures. John, Bethanyy, Andy, Kenzie, the whole crew. I can't wait for them to be devoloped. No word on what I got OFFICALLY for my birthday yet (parents, family, blah blah) But I'll find out when my dad gets home. I am going out to eat at Bubba Gump's Shrimp tonight, I'll edit and say what I got.

I can't wait for Friday. SAW 2, bitches! With Andy & John. It'll be kick-butt. Hmm.. also. I got my school pictures back. Not. Pretty. I swear, they are the worst pictures I have ever seen in my life. You have to see them to believe me. My eyes are too squinted, my bangs royally suck, and I look like I'm biting my lip. My mom will be pissed off. She hates my hair when I wear it like that. Pfft. Well, will edit l8er.

<b>EDITED:</b> I am so damn tired. And my stomach hurts like hell. I ate too much. And all that shrimp, bread, and Dr. Pepper float is going to turn into flab. Since I didn't eat anything else all day. I got a few more 'happy birthdays', played with my NEW CELL PHONE. That's right, new cell. It's a flip-phone, super sexy. Like me. HAHA. But um, my parents fought the whole time and my mom was depressed she didn't get me anything good for my birthday. She got me Degrassi. Like, she extended the cable so I could watch Degrassi everyday and she's getting me a hotel this weekend. And uhh. My sister got me a Saw shirt and the DVD, but yeah. She didn't give it to me yet since I was being a brat. Yay. Brat.

Aww. I feel so special. Kenize, Bethany, Micah, Cassidy, and Brianna also instant messaged me with that. Thanks guys! I love you. But my stomach hurts like hell, and I left my camera at my dad's.

I don't even have a costume for Halloween to top it off. I think I'm going to hand out candy, I'm becoming an older brat. Too old for parties, and too old for trick or treating. And on Halloween, it's Micah's birthday. Yaaaaaay. I love Micah. xoxoxoxo OH YEAH. And I got new shoes. They are sexy. Yay, shoes.

Don't worry Betsy & Emily, I love you guys too. I might do something this coming Saturday though. Who knows, I just hope John got my homework done. If he didn't, I'll rip his English up. GURANTEED. Other than that, I really have nothing to say. I've been on the computer for my four-day weekend, and I really don't want to go back to school. I have no energyyyyy. It is drained out of me. Maybe I can sit on it all week with my Webcam so Micah can beg. HAHA. Shh, I never said that. Well I'm going to go. Tori is pissing me off, as usual. Little bitch.

<u>Nice legs. When are they open?</u>

Ahh, yes. Shame I haven't heard that one until today. What a compliment! I acutally hate my legs. Mmm, celulite. I have a C+ in English? Got to boost that up to the A+ I deserve, bitch. Um. Math I gotz my work in. Hopefully I will get it in on Monday too. Johnny-cakes. 

..Let's see. I was going to go up to Wisconsin for my special 'four day' weekend. But I decided not to, just chill at home. But I always wanted to like have a party. It just seems so fun in the movies, until you get busted by the po-po or someone starts raping someone else. Pot, someone pukes, parents come home. Yadda, yadda. Wow. I'm such a dork. Plus my mom would kill me, I am serious. I'd never see the light of day again. I'm all pale and shit, skin & bones, and my mom is whipping me. I can see it all now. Living in the closet. Dreamy!

I heard something else today like my boobs were bigger than _____. I can't remember though. THE JOYS OF HANGING OUT WITH GUYS. Oh yes. John, Andy, Max, Evan, all that. That reminds me, I'm partners with Evan in Science. I see an F in the future. Ahaha, just kidding. ..I'm cold. Brr. I also threw a pen in Andy's eye today. Pretty damn funny if you ask me.

Anything else? Nope, there is not. Seeya later bitches. I have to go open my legs. Wish me luck on my four-day weekend. WITH THE HOUSE TO MYSELF. OH YEAH. Mall of America tomorrow too, with my daddy-o; I'm getting a flapper outfit. I have no clue what the fuck I am doing for Halloween though. Free candy? Party? Nothing? I just want to wear that swingin' 20's costume. {I lied, I had more}

P.S. MY BIRTHDAY IS IN 7 DAYS. That means.. SAW 2 COMES OUT IN 9 DAYS. Give me a hoo-hah!

P.S.S. ALEX HACH IS HOTT. HAHA. (And I'm cold)"

And I had homework. But I am freezing right now, I need to sit in the sauna. I also discovered that if I walk to school, the bus shows up the same time I do. Then when I walk home, the bus pulls up to my house as soon as I get to the door. I need to lose some lbs, so I think I'll walk to school from now on. Yay exercise! Damn, I'm cold.

Let's see. My dog keeps eating shit and biting me for kicks, and scratched my face while playing. Pretty, eh? Other than that, I am going shopping I believe. ANNND, my dad brought me some dill dip. I'm so happy, cause now I can make a cucumber SANDWICH. I hear you all drooling, that's right. DAMN, IT's COLD IN THE BASEMENT THING. And I have Golddigger stuck in my head, thanks to ANDY PENK.

I forgot about my live journal. Emily, sob in depression. Alot has happened. Yay for alot happening. Let's see, shall we? The party was okay, nothing too special. Just a good old fashion partay. Let's skip forward. TO JULY 27TH. I went to the Superior Fair. Head of the Lakes or something. With Kessler n' some other chicks. And Cullen. And I bought a rabbit, I have a picture on a floppy disk. But it's at Kessler's house. Cause I am forgetful. Anyway, she is a holland lop and I named her Betty. I couldn't control myself, and I just bought her. With my 15 buck-a-roos. I am keeping Betty at Kessler's house with her bunny Ginger. They got along great, for some odd reason. Because Ginger is usual a bitch. Giggle. Bitchy bunny. But I figured out why they got along so well. Ginger is a freaking ""George"". And they mated. And now Betty is pregnant! She is due on the 27th of August. I can't wait, I'm really excited. My little Betty is having little.. Betty's! (and George's) So that was a nice suprise. I'm coutning down.

And I went to Florida (Panama City). Cause I am moving there. God, it is so nice the house we found. So. Damn. Nice. Right across from a bayou? God. For once my mom getting lost was a good thing. That ""For Rent"" sign popped up and it was ours in a snap. It's in a richy-rich neighborhood. So it will look like I am all rich. That means nice school. Haha. Rent is 950 a month. Is that alot? I think it is. Well I'm not paying, so doesn't matter to me. I get my own bedroom BIATCH. That's all that matters.

And my mom's friend already hooked me up with a job when I am 15. Nice or what? I am set. Ready to rumble. But I don't know what to do about Betty. I wasn;t suppose to have her in the first place, but now that she's pregnant it'll be somewhat hard to convince mom. Won't it? Gimme luck. If yyou have luck, rub it on the computer screen or e-mail it to me at hardcore_scrapbooking@yahoo.com. Yay thanks. I am so anxious for her to have her babies. ;DD

..That's all. So. Yeah.

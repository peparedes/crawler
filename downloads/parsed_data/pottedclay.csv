"event","I'm just lounging in my dorm, watching Scrubs (which is an awesome show) and thinking about how great my life is right now. I know I&nbsp;complain a lot, and I&nbsp;really don't mean to make such a big deal out of little things that put me out, but I'm also not going to deny that I do it. Today, though, I feel like life is on the right track. I have a wonderful group of friends who are supportive and fun. I have a handsome, intelligent boyfriend who makes me smile all the time. I have a class schedule&nbsp;that's interesting and challenging, but not&nbsp;overwhelming.&nbsp;

I guess I just wanted to&nbsp;say, that I'm glad that everything is so good right now. That everything is going my way. And I hope everyone else feels as good as I do about life right now.

"event","<p>Hmm... college is fun fun fun. So, I've been up all night doing homework and listening to music and I am sad to say that I haven't even finished all of my work. I can't. I have to go to the art studio an hour before class so that I can try to quickly sketch out a scene from outside that window. That will be another hour on top of the other four hours that I've spent on that project... and I seriously doubt that I will finish before class. Grr.<br /><br />Every time things here get hard, I start thinking about how I could just drop out of college and be a housewife. I feel evil making that my back-up, mostly because it makes it sound like I think that being a housewife is inferior to being a working-woman, but I really don't. I kinda do want to stay at home with my children (when I have children... after I graduate from college and get married and everything).&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm feeling really confused. I think it may be the combination of no sleep and no caffeine. Blargh. I feel like the world is spinning and I have really crappy motor-skills. This is going to make art class super fun!<br /><br />Ugh. Sometimes I feel bad about things that obviously aren't my fault. I don't know why I make it my problem when it's not, but I do. And then I feel terrible about it, and make myself cry when there is nothign wrong with me. AGH! Sometimes I wish that my brain would work just a little harder... then maybe I wouldn't have this problem.</p>"

"event","<p>I'm kind of fragile. I put on the facade of having this tough outer shell, but really I'm always on the brink of breakdown. I'm depressed and worn-out. I'm overly sensitive. But in recent years I've lost the ability to tell people what's going on with me.<br /><br />In german class, we learned that when you ask the question, ""Wie gehts es Ihnen?"" you can't just expect the answer ""Gut."" Germans don't ask each other ""how are you doing?"" unless they are really interested in knowing how that person feels. For some reason, I can never answer that question with anything more than ""Fine."" I'm always 'fine' even when I'm not. Someone could have just shot my mother and I could be inconsolable, but if someone asked me how I was right then, I would probably just answer. ""Fine.""<br /><br />I feel emotionally stunted. I'm beginning to realize that I am deathly afraid to talk about my feelings with people. Perhaps this is why I am always ready to explode. I feel like I can't even tell them to the people I trust the most... even when I want to. I'm a burden in most relationships because of this. I'm like this really big weight that other's have to drag around, and I hate to impose by making them listen to me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I worry that I will kill the only good relationships that arise in my life with my apathy. Sometimes I flat-out lie about how I feel. ""Is everything okay?"" ""Yeah. I'm good."" I want to tell you that I'm about to cry, that I'm stressed, that I need a hug, but instead I smile dryly and say, ""I'm gonna go take a shower."" The shower is where I have breakdowns now. I don't feel comfortable crying around my clustermates, and it's the most private place I can think of. No one is going to stick their head in an ask what's going on.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sorry if I'm distant sometimes. Bare with me. I'm trying.</p>"

"event","I had so much homework last night. So much. I started around 8:45pm and stopped at 4:00am. That's not to say that I finished.... because I didn't. I finished the things that are due in 40mins or so, though. Fucking art.&nbsp;Those drawings are crap, and I hope she doesn't realize that in front of the whole class during critique. That would suck (but it happens all the time, I guess). Lila loves to rip me apart.&nbsp; 

I've been stressed and therefore I'm not sleeping well. I haven't slept very well in a couple days (thus th reason I'm always passed out in the afternoons wen people call me). I keep waking up in the middle of the night, and when I wake up in the morning I'm usually pretty sore. I snapped at a friend when he tried to give me ideas of how to de-stress before bed, too. I didn't mean to, I just did. I hate when I do that. I think I'm gonna take his advice, though and take some melatonin before bed. That should help me calm down. 

I slept through English, again. I'm gonna flunk that class. I hate that it's such an easy class but that I will probably fail it because I'm too tired to wake up and go! ARRGH! I guess I better just write the best goddamned paper there ever was for Monday (assuming I go my extension). 

I feel like I'm going to fall apart. School is going to kill me."

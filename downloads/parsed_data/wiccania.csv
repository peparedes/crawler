So what to do with this one?  That's the question.  I'd kinda like to use it for something interesting, rather than let it just languish here... It was, after all, my first blog.

"event","Thanksgiving was ok.  Lots of food for one person to eat.  Gage didn't touch a bite of Thanksgiving food.  No, that's not right, he did TOUCH the cranberry sauce.  He just didn't eat it.  It was more of a ""what exactly is this mom?"" touch.  Not a ""I think I'll give this a try"" touch.  At the moment he's laying on the floor in a pile of pillows and rearranging the CDs.  Nice.  I didn't alphabetize them or anything.  Didn't want them to be in any particular order...

So I've just watched the Avs lose to Calgary.  It wasn't thrilling, to say the least.  It's a shame I missed much of the pre-game show.  Apparently there was a bit of an on-ice scuffle before the game even started.  They showed a little of it during the 1st intermission, but not enough to see what might have caused it.  I'm rather curious.

Gage has piled up the pillows from his bed, my bed and one of the couch cushions on the floor (the aforementioned pile of pillows).  He's relaxing in the pile at the moment.  It looks comfy, maybe I'll join him in a few minutes, LOL."

"event","When Joe and my mom first got together, the basement of the townhouse we lived in contained 2 or 3 rolling <a href=""http://www.carguygarage.com"">tool cabinets</a>.  Seriously, this is a man who loves his tools.  Every tool had his name engraved on it.  Not etched on crudely with some random tool, actually engraved.  He either spent the money when he bought them to have them engraved, or he knew someone who could do engraving at home and had them do it.  Either way -- he loves his tools.  My younger sister and I got him a new toolkit, the ones they sell at Sears at the holidays, for the holidays 3 or 4 years in a row and he loved them.  He didn't pretend to love them, he genuinely loved these toolkits.  I'd love to be able to get him a brand new, custom took cabinet for their new place sometime.  I think that would be the perfect gift for him.

"event","It's supposed to snow later today.  I kind of look forward to it.  Gage will certainly like it.  He absolutely loves the snow.  Tiger will probably enjoy it to a degree, but he gets so cold.  Poor puppy's got no body fat and he's not a fluffy long haired dog with lots of fur to keep him warm.  I've noticed that he gets all shivery as soon as he gets outside on a cold day.  As much as I loathe putting clothing on dogs, there are times in the winter that I wish I had a coat for him, and maybe something to cover his paws when it snows.  I know, I'm a freak.

Another plus of the whole snow thing is exercise.  Assuming it sticks and doesn't melt 20 minutes later, I can get some good exercise shoveling.  I've been so stressed the past few months that I haven't paid much attention to diet and exercise, even though I was trying to lose weight.  I doubt I've lost much since May or so.    Stress and lack of funds haven't helped me eat very well.

So, I signed up for a site called grocery game and looked over the list of current sales for my local store and compared them with the coupons that I've got.  Looking at the site, I can definitely see how people manage to buy $100 worth of groceries for 50 cents.  I know part of it is that those people are never buying fresh produce or meat.  But if I can get all the ""prepackaged"" stuff I need for just a few dollars, I can spend more on fresh produce and meat.  It would be a win-win situation."

Actually, I was sorting coupons about 15 minutes ago.  I'm not done.  I need to get an organizer for them.  One with a few sections I can customize.  I always have a few coupons when I go to the store that I plan to use that day, usually because it's something that I use regularly.  Having a section to put those into would be good.  Along with somewhere to put the ones that I ""might"" use that trip.

Gage is being very cute today.  He's reading his ""I Spy"" book.  I'm not sure if he's actually reading it or if he's memorized parts of it.  But he's on the floor with one of the couch cushions looking at the book and saying ""I spy..."" and saying what some of the stuff in the book is.  It's incredibly cute.

I need to go to the grocery store.  I needs to get me a turkey and stuff.  Of course, I also needs to find me a couple thou just lying around, LOL."

While I doubt that when the time comes they'll be looking at <a href=""http://www.prudentialelliman.com/HamptonsNorthFork.aspx"">North Fork real estate properties</a>, I have no doubt that PrudentialElliman.com can help them find something wherever they're looking.

"event","So I'm watching Titanic on TNT.  No real reason, it's just on and I wanted some background noise while I did some cross stitch.  It got me thinking... when the movie came out in theaters, my sister and my friend Mare went to see it several times.  They came to visit me in Virginia and took me to see it.  I didn't cry at the end.  The boat sank, people died.  I expected that.  It's how history happened.  Jack died.  I expected that, too.  He was in the water.  I didn't cry.  They said that I was a heartless bitch.  They were only half serious, of course.  Watching it now, I'm again not crying.  There are some movies that make me bawl no matter how many times I see them.  Mr. Holland's Opus... waterworks as soon as he walks into that rally honoring him... it never fails.  Titanic.  Nope.  No tears.  No, that's wrong.  There was one time that I got teary eyed.  The only time Woody and I watched the movie together.  We were cuddled up on the couch and I was pregnant.  Maybe it was the hormones."

"event","So, I got some cross stitch kits from someone on one of the boards I'm on.  She wasn't planning on doing them, so she sent them to me.  Would it be unethical if I do the cross stitch and then sell the finished products?  I've done a couple of other kits I got already.  Ornaments.  I haven't done cross stitch in years, and I've never tackled a project as big as the two I have left, but I'm enjoying the challenge.  Believe it or not, the person who taught me to do it was a guy I dated in high school.  I thought it was funny as hell the first time I saw him doing it.  I mean, cross stitch?  A teenage boy?  I have to admit that it's quite relaxing though, and passes the time nicely.  The two projects I have left (one that I'm working on now) are both holiday patterns.  One's a banner with some snowmen that says ""Snow place like home for the holidays"" and the other is a cabin in a woody area with snow all around.  I'm a little nervous about that one.  It looks pretty intense.  but it'll be fun to do.  Gage has started picking it up when I put it down and trying to do it himself.  So I got some extra fabric and put it in a hoop for him to play with.  He did a cute little bit of just putting the thread through back and forth.  I just have to figure out what to do with it.  Maybe I'll stitch on some backing and make a little pillow.

Anyhoo... There's not a lot going on today.  Got some cleaning done, did some cross stitch, read a little bit.  I'm getting woefully low on the TBR pile.  Actually, I think I'm out of new reading material.  Alas, I'm down to 2 credits on paperbackswap, so I'm looking for a good 3 for 1 deal.  There are always deals, but they don't always apply to books that I'm interested in reading.

I'm waiting to hear back from Alpine Access on rescheduling my interview.  Hopefully I'll be able to get an interview soon and get the job and start working and all that good stuff.  I bought a headset on ebay so I can be prepared and not have to wait a week or two before I can start.  I have to find my list of other call center from home companies and apply with them as well though... improve my chances."

"event","Ok, I just have to post about this stuff... Gage is adorable (I'm sure I've mentioned that), but even more so while he's discovering language and trying to talk more.  Much of what he says is repetition, but sometimes he babbles on and on and I just KNOW he's trying to tell me something.  Lately he's taken to trying to get me to repeat after him.  I'm doing it, because maybe if I say what he's saying it'll start to make sense.  If I can understand what he's trying to say, maybe I can correct the way he's saying it and then we'll be on the road to better communication.

Anyhoo... Gage likes to count.  He'll sit there and count to 30 over and over again.  one... two... three... through the single digits to the teens, fourteen... fifteen... sixteen... and into the twenties, where it cracks me up, twenty seven... twenty eight... twenty nine... 

twenty ten.

I don't know where he gets it.  He's said thirty before.  As a matter of fact, I've heard him count as high as thirty five.  Maybe he got it from one of his classmates.  I dunno, but it makes me giggle (although I DO correct him).

Today he repeated some phrases from one of his sign language DVDs, descriptionss of the signs to help remember how to do the sign.  The first one was milk.  To sign the word milk, hold your hand in front of you and squeeze.  Like you're squeezing an udder, get it?  Milk.  The description is ""Like squeezing milk from a cow.""  Gage was signing milk and said ""like squeaking milk from a cow.""  That brought a good giggle.

Later he was doing the same thing with monkey.  To sign monkey, well... it's basically the monkey imitation we all did as kids.  Both hands making a ""scratching"" motion under the arms.  The description is ""like a monkey scratching himself.""  Gage signs it great, but when he repeats the description it comes out ""like a monkey crapping himself.""  Yes, it's stupid potty humor and I should be ashamed, but I laughed for about 20 minutes the first time he said that.

Cute, no?  He certainly makes every day interesting.  But at least he's trying, even the lady at Conoco commented last time we were in that since he's started school he seems more extroverted than he was over the summer.

It was taken post trick or treat, since he wouldn't hold still for a picture before we went trick or treating.  Cute, no?  Not too bad for a costume made with no pattern.  I think it came out pretty good, and he made an adorable little bat.  Maybe next year I can dress him up as a character from Star Wars -- since he seems to love it so much.  Of course that could change by next year... still, the tentative plan for next year is Luke Skywalker or Han Solo or something along those lines.  He's already got a light saber."

The grand prize is to have your design go into production, available at NAAW with a portion of the proceeds going to a charity.  1st prize is a prototype of your bear and a $500 savings bond.  It's kind of interesting.  I'm entering, since reps are allowed to enter.  I have a couple of ideas that I think would be really cute.  If anyone here wants to enter (or have their kids enter), I can email the entry form to you.  I might give Gage a form to color on as well... who knows, he might do something brilliant.  He's done some pretty creative things before.

I'm very much enjoying the hockey season so far.  The Avs aren't doing too badly.  Had a little trouble on the road at first, but they're getting it.

The cats are acting strange lately.  They're extremely affectionate.  Which is nice, but occasionally annoying.  I don't want to have them begging for affection while I'm going to the bathroom, for example.  It's sweet, don't get me wrong.  But damn.  They're also having some interesting nights with the weather changing.  It gets cold and then it's warm again and all that.  And they flip out every time the weather changes.  They also keep trying to go outside.  If I'm outside or if Gage is outside I let them on the porch.  They like to lay in the sun when it's shining."

In the music technology class, we had some of the <a href=""http://www.finalemusic.com/finale/home.aspx"">best music software</a> you could imagine.  All kinds of stuff for musicians.  Some of it was made to help people learn music - notation, various symbols, harmonizing, etc.  Of course, my personal favorites were the programs that helped in writing music.  Programs that allowed you to input and control every aspect of the music, play it back and make whatever adjustments you needed to make.  Very good software.  When I graduated, I was sorely tempted to swipe one of the computers from the music department along with all of the software and accessories.  Finalemusic.com has some similar software available, I might have to look into making a purchase.  If only for the software to create sheet music.  Much easier than writing it all out by hand."

I walked up to Conoco earlier to see if they have any blistex.  My lips are burning with the preamble to bad chapping.  No such luck.  They did have carmex, so I got that.  It'll do in a pinch.

Then I made some wings with newspaper, wire and black crepe fabric that I had in my fabric bag.  They look cute, though not as perfect as i would have liked to have made them.  If I could guarantee that Gage would have worn a different style of wings I'd have made them a little more flowy and less stiff.  I'm gonna attach the wings to the ""harness"" part of his ""kid leash"" so they won't really be on him... Hopefully he won't get upset and rip them off.

He made it most of the day today without throwing up, but then he woke from a nap and tossed his cookies.  Of course the fact that he napped is also indication that he's not feeling well.  He never naps.  Ok, rarely.

Hockey season has begun, but this year you'll all be spared the endless series of posts about the Avs, how they're playing and my commentary on various games.  I'll be doing all of those posts <a href=""http://wiccspassion.blogspot.com/"">somewhere else</a> this year.  I'm sure that some of you are breathing a sigh of relief.  That doesn't mean that there won't be any hockey/Avs posts here this season... just so ya know.

We went about 6 hours without power today. That was fun.  Apparently the storm knocked our our power for awhile.  All the neighbors went out.  Gage and I played on the couch and cuddled under a blanket.  It was nice.  Fortunately we have a gas stove, so when the power goes out I can still cook.  I'm not sure if I've got the guts to light the oven manually, but the stove I can do."

I don't even recall if there was a car in the garage at the time, I think it was mostly storage to be honest.  Even though it was out of the wind, it was always freezing in the garage.  A <a href=""http://www.carguygarage.com"">garage heater</a> would have been nice.  We could have stayed down there and chatted for hours if we wanted to, if the garage had been heated.

"event","Gage is addicted to A New Hope.  To the point that the tape is wearing out.  Of course, these aren't new tapes.  We got them at a pawn shop 5 or 6 years ago, and it's the box set of the original theatrical release (digitally remastered) that was released 10 or so years ago.  So definitely not new.

Anytime I've tried to put Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi in the VCR he's ejected the tape and given me A New Hope to put in.  So today I mixed them up, put the wrong movie in each case to see if I could get him to watch Empire or Jedi.  He got home, pulled out A New Hope, looked at it, and then pulled the other two movies out of the cases and put them back in the correct cases.

Now I just need to figure out if he's actually reading the title on the tapes, or of he's just memorized the shape of the letters.  Probably the latter, but the former wouldn't surprise me.  I did manage to get Empire in the VCR while he wasn't looking.  When the George Lucas interview started he gave me this look like ""Do you really think you fooled me?"""

Gonna glue layers of newspaper together to make the wings out of, with some wire to support.  Then I have some black crepe fabric that I can stitch over that to make em black.  I wanna get some of those glowing neckaces to glue to the wings for the bones, or some glow in the dark paint to just paint the lines.

Halloween is my favorite holiday and autumn in general is my favorite season.  How lovely would it be to someday spend Halloween in Salem Massachusetts?  Ok, I know it sounds kind of cliche, but I've heard that Halloween is just fantastic in Salem.  Besides, I hear the autumn colors in Massachusetts are spectacular.  So it's something that I've thought it would be nice to do for several years.  Well, when I decided it's time to start fantasizing about a perfect getaway, whether for a weekend or a whole week, I start looking at <a href=""http://www.HotelReservations.com"">Hotel Reservations</a> and other travel necessities at HotelReservations.com.  Why them?  Well, to be perfectly honest, the first time I heard of them I checked out 3 or 4 different discount travel sites and compared them to HotelReservations.com and they showed the best rates every time.  Whether I was searching for a big location 2 weeks from the date of the search, or something a little less known 6 months from then, HotelReservations.com was always a good deal cheaper.

So I searched Salem Massachusetts for the week of Halloween, starting with <a href=""http://www.HotelReservations.com"">Hotel Reservations</a>.  For a 5 day stay at Courtyard by Mariott it would only be about $800, not too bad.  Mariott is a fabulous chain with lots of nice amenities.  Of course, there are also cheaper hotels (local chains and such) listed that would only cost $450-500.  Also, not bad.  In addition to listing the rates and hotel amenities, the site gives a list of nearby attractions and how far away they are.  Which is good for trip planning.  Airfare through HotelReservations.com (if it was booked today) is only about $500 a person.  So we're looking at a 5 day vacation $1500-$2000 over Halloween in what is supposed to be one of the biggest Halloween destinations in the country and that's if it's booked only 4 weeks in advance.  As usual, I checked a couple of other sites, there's no contest.  HotelReservations.com is the best deal.

So he got them out and tried to take a bite of one.  It was too hard, so he put them in the microwave.  He didn't start it, he looked to me to defrost the grapes, but he knew that putting something frozen in the microwave could make it not frozen.  I couldn't stop laughing.  It was cute and funny at the same time.

Tiger got in trouble the other day and was sent ""to bed,""  which means that he goes into his crate.  I closed it, because he was to be grounded for an hour or so.  Gage grabbed the door after I latched it and started pulling and saying ""no no no no no"" and yelling at me.  So I let Tiger out and Gage gave him a hug.  Much cuteness.  Tiger got a reprieve because Gage loves him so.  He's a lucky dog."

We had to play at night, because the ""net"" was a shadow across the street in front of my mom's house.  The side boundaries were the curbs and there were shadows to indicate the back boundaries.  One team on either side of the ""net"" shadow.  And a ball.

We served the ball like in volleyball (we always used one of those 99 cent kiddie balls they sell in the big square tower in toy stores), and you had to hit or kick the ball back to the other side.  It could only bounce once or the other team got a point.  If you hit it out, the other team got a point, etc.  Like volleyball rules, basically.  It was fun.  A great way to get some night time exercise no matter what the weather was."

It didn't sell, but the watcher sent me a message that she was out when the auction ended and asked if I'd relist it with a $7 buy it now (there was no BIN on the original auction, and it started at$2.50).  I relisted it with a $5 BIN.  I'm glad I did.  When she sent the paypal payment, the note said that she showed the auction to her son who was very excited about the costume and was really excited by the idea of being Tigger for Halloween.  It's a great costume and Gage looked adorable in it, but he can't fit it anymore... so it's nice that it'll go to another little boy who's really excited about it.  It's really nice, you know?

In other cuteness news... Gage has begun to tickle.  No seriously.  He came up behind me yesterday and started tickling at my tummy and sides and saying ""tickletickletickle"" and giggling his butt off.  It was so cute.  And so much fun!  So we spent an hour chasing and tickling and laughing until we couldn't breathe and collapsed on the couch in exhaustion.  THAT's the good stuff."

That's one reason I love <a href=""http://www.couponchief.com"">couponchief.com</a>.  It's a great place to get online coupon codes for tons of different websites.  There are <a href=""http://www.couponchief.com/disneyshopping"">Disneyshopping.com coupons</a>, for example, and it's a great place to get new stuffed animals for Gage and I can save up to 75% through CouponChief.com.  Or I can get <a href=""http://www.couponchief.com/giftbaskets.com"">Giftbaskets.com coupon codes</a> for 10% off a nice gift for Gage's teachers to share and enjoy.  What can I say, saving money is always a good thing.

"event","So, it rained earlier.  Gage went out after it tapered to a drizzle, took off his shirt and started to cover his chest with mud.  I didn't understand what he was doing until he looked at me and said something that sounded a lot like ""why am I so different?""  The line delivered by Tarzan in the Disney film after he covers himself in mud.  It's funny, because Gage hasn't seen that in at least a month.

No school tomorrow since it's Labor Day.  I think I might take Gage up to the park for a little while.  I think he'd enjoy that.  He liked it the last time we went up there.  It has a nice playground.  Of course last time he was the only kid there.  This time there might be other kids playing -- not having school and all."

For those of us who do crave adventure and excitement, we can enlist the aid of <a href=""http://www.tusker.com/unrivaledExpertise_kilimanjaroExperts.cfm"">Kilimanjaro experts</a> from Tusker.com to plan for us an exciting adventure climbing Mt. Kilamanjaro.  Owner Eddie Frank has been climbing Kilamanjaro for almost as long as I've been -- so it's safe to say that he knows the way.  If Kilamanjaro isn't of interest, there's also trekking Mongolia and Tanzania to consider and climbing Mt. Aconcagua.  They're even booking for a Mongolia Solar Eclipse tour in August 2008.  Boy would I love to be able to participate in that event.

"event","Or ""This is the night..."" Gage is watching Lady & the Tramp and singing along. It's terribly cute. He's also got the keyboard and is banging on it along with the music. I'm thinking it might be worth it to get that video game that teaches piano. I can't remember what it's called. I bet he'd enjoy that, though. Heck, I'd probably enjoy it too. What can I say, I'm just a big kid.

Did you know that you can make fried chicken in the rotisserie? No, I'm serious. I suppose that technically it's not fried chicken, but damned if it didn't come out just like fried chicken but a little less oily. I prepared the chicken just like I normally would for fried chicken. Flour, egg wash and my breading mixture. Put it into the rotisserie basket (after rubbing the basket down with a little vegetable oil to prevent sticking) and cooked it according to the directions. See, as it turns and the fat cooks off, the fat rolls over the outside of the meat before it drips off. That's part of what helps keep it moist and helps it sear. I lost very little breading in the cooking process and had what was essentially fried chicken. It was pretty damned cool."

"event","On one of the trips to St. Louis a couple of years ago, Woody and his dad taught me to shoot using a <a href=""http://www.airgundepot.com/bbpelletguns.html"">BB gun</a> -- a Crosman Air Rifle, if I remember correctly.  It was rather cool.  Later, Woody broke out the one he was given as a kid.  A Daisy that's still in great condition.  So the three of us took turns shooting at a soda can his dad tossed off the balcony.  I got several compliments from his dad, especially since 1 of the air rifles the sight was a little bit off, and I was switching from one to the other without missing a shot.  Called me Annie Oakley.  I wouldn't mind getting one for myself, actually.  I really enjoyed shooting them.

"event","Got his bus assignment Wednesday so he went to school yesterday.  It was so cute when he got on the bus.  He was all kinds of eager.  He had his little Batman lunch bag and hopped up on the bus.  Then he sat right down in the same spot he sat on the bus last year.  I talked to his teacher, he did pretty good except for a few fits at school.  Those were expected.  He had a few fits at the start of last year, too.  I also found out that he used a urinal all by himself.  As far as I know, he's never seen a urinal.  So I'm guessing that seeing a peer use it was encouraging to him.  Got some information about the class, and his teacher is going to call me after school everyday next week to discuss his progress and adjustment and stuff."

"event","Gage still doesn't have a bus assignment.  When I talked to them last week they said 5-7 working days.  Well, Monday was 7 working days.  I'm irritated as hell, to say the least.  I have another call into transportation.  They only check voice mail twice a day and will get back to me the next day, according to the message.  So I should hear from them today.  If I don't hear from them by 2, I'm going to call and express my irritation more aggressively.  I just have to try and avoid 4-letter words while I'm doing it.

I was watching Les Miserables in Concert yesterday.  Gage seemed to enjoy the music.  He was humming along.  I've been working on getting him to say a few more words.  Particularly to vocalize the things he wants.  Instead of just bringing me something he wants and saying please, I'm trying to get him to say ""waffle please"" or ""movie please.""  I'll work on the specific names of the movies later."

"event","When I was in school I went on several trips... Myrtle Beach, Bellingham Washington, Disneyland.  They were all band trips, competitions actually.  There wasn't anything educational about them, except for learning to budget your food money to last the entire trip.  It would have been interesting to be involved in <a href=""http://www.hemispheretravel.com"">student educational travel</a>, but I don't think any of the schools I went to did that sort of thing.  Imagine taking an educational tour of Washington DC or another notable US city -- or European city, for that matter.  You see it in movies and on television shows all the time.  An educational class trip to Paris or something.  Apparently there ARE schools who do trips like that.  I think it would have been a fun an interesting learning experience to have been able to do something like that.  Imagine the excitement for the subject matter that a trip like that would generate among students.  I like that idea, myself.

Usually when he wakes up in the middle of the night he comes and sleeps with me.  Which is cute, but he moves around so much that I spend the night getting kicked.  This morning he was on the couch.  Which was really cute.  He does tend to fall asleep on the couch a lot, and it IS a comfy couch. I'm so exhausted.  I keep meaning to take a sleeping pill to help me sleep through the night.  And then forgetting.

Still waiting on Gage's bus assignment.  If I don't get a call by noon, I'm calling the school.  Yesterday was 7 working days from registration.  They said 5 - 7 working days."

"event","I love dogs.  Of all the pets that I could possibly have, dogs are my favorite.  They're loving and loyal and so happy.  When I was a kid, I always wanted a pure bred dog.  We always had the typical lovable mutt, and they were great -- don't get me wrong, but I always thought it would be nice to have 1 pure breed in my life.  There's a series of books written by Jonathan Kellerman in which the main character adopts a French Bulldog.  The way he was described was so cute I had to look them up -- it was such an interesting description.  They're very interesting dogs.  I would consider talking to a <a href=""http://www.saltcreekkennel.com/french_bulldog_puppies.asp"">French bulldog breeder</a> someday about the pros and cons of that particular breed.  I think they might be an interesting breed to own someday.

"event","and by the trilogy, I mean THE trilogy -- there's only one ""The Trilogy.""  Star Wars, of course.  I put in A New Hope yesterday to see if Gage would watch it.  Lo and behold, he did.  Intently.  He even hummed along to the music and mimicked light saber noises.  A couple of hours after watching it, he brought me the tape and handed it to me -- his way of telling me he wants to watch a certain movie.  So I put it in again.  He watched again.

Today he asked for it again.  Instead of A New Hope, I put in Empire Strikes Back.  There was humming, light saber noises even blaster noises.  So when Empire ended, I put in Return of the Jedi.  Again, Gage watched.

Now he's humming the Imperial March -- indeed, he is my boy!*  It's so very cute.  I could certainly deal with an addiction to Star Wars.  Personally, I could watch the trilogy over and over again (oh wait, I have).  Maybe he'll get some Star Wars toys for christmas or something.


* - for those of you who don't know, when I got married I walked down the aisle to the Imperial March, and I woud do it again."

"event","I've begun plotting my search for employment.  Going to get a part-time job while Gage is in school.  I picked up an application at the Conoco up the road already.  Just gotta fill it out and stuff.  It'll be fun looking up all the past employment information.  Especially since my last job is no longer there (it was a seasonal Kiosk), I don't know the last name of the manager I had at Harry and David -- he's just ""Louie.""  I'll have to look up phone numbers and stuff.  Fun fun fun.  I think I'll put all the info in a notepad so I can reference it without having to look it up over and over again.  There are a few other places in walking distance here.  A dry cleaner, liquor store and dollar-scoop chinese place off the top of my head,not to mention a Lamars donut shop (yummy yummy).  There's more further away.

Had some stuff on ebay that did pretty well.  Got almost $40 for my waterford crystal bowl, which is most excellent.  Gotta pack that very carefully for shipping.  The person who bought it didn't opt for insurance.  I plan to insure it anyway.  Just chalk it up to ""CMA"" covering my ass.  I didn't price them before I listed it, so no doubt the buyer got a good deal.  It's not like I used it much anyway.  It was (feel free to laugh at this) used as a condom bowl.  All in all I made about $60 before shipping, so that's not too shabby.  Sold my frog tea set as well.  I don't use it anymore anyway... might as well go to someone who can use or display it.  Need to continue going through stuff for ebay."

"event","I was listening to some late night radio love line from the US. And I heard about something called ""Thanksgiving syndrome"" the caller asked what the disadvantages of having a relationship with his  cousin would be the doctor mentioned the fact it is illicit in most states and tends to mess with the genetics. Then the caller mentioned it was a homosexual relationship.The doctor replied, ""Basically after the relationship is over- which in many cases it does end, you'll have to see each other again, like on christmas and thanksgiving when your family gets together, and when you see each other, it's really negative."" Maybe the same can apply to bandmates that make the mistake of starting a relationship? I mean. They see each other all the time because they have to. Perhaps it's even worse than ""Thanksgiving syndrome"" because you have those negative feelings and you see them often..."

Goodbye.</lj-cut>"

"event","I decided to go to the grocery store. I figured people have to do it sometime, so I did. I was looking at produce... so fucking expensive... Then this girl showed up, she was a worker and she was on her break. She was cute... kind of... not really... okay, so she was kind of cute in a special way. She told me how to make a really exotic salad so I am going to try it. Then I met another girl at the park, she was really cute... or something like that. It doesn't matter if she was cute or not. I had a lot of fun talking to her.  *sighs* I need someone... someone to talk to... <em>...or fuck...</em> it's starting to drive me crazy..."

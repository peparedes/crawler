Yeah grades have been up since last Wednesday and I have yet to look at mine. Because...lets just say I'm not under the impression that I passed with flying colors or whatever that expression is. I figure maybe writing about it will make me curious enough to see how I did...nope not this time.

This weekend was good times full of pseudo shopping. I spent Friday helping Carryn pick out clothes at a mall in NPR. Gotta love Pasco ain't nothing better. Her niece Sarah is adorable and started dancing to the music in the stores. She also dances to cell phone rings...it  makes shopping highly entertaining...that and theres a great opportunity for people watching. Saturday I woke up to a rooster which decided I should wake up at 6. Then I woke up to dogs barking...yeah so my sister lives in the ghetto. But it's all good because I got to go to international and it only took like 10 minutes to get there. I dropped off an application with Andrea who told me that I have the job because she told her boss that I was smart....which made me laugh because I suck at mental math and counting change but as a cashier you need skillz like that so I decided not to say anything. Sunday went to church with the family but I ducked out early because I was gonna pass out if I stayed in there any longer...fun times. Not looking forward to sleeping in my bed tonight because I slept in Mike and Jens bed last night and I think it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in ...so the twin extra-long is not really gonna cut it. Woke up to the rooster again this morning that and my dad calling to yell at me for still being in bed at ten when I was supposed to be to school at 11. When we left a boy was in the street with a gun shooting at a can. Yeah told ya she lives in ghetto.

Back at school....and thats about it. By the way I'm rockin the whole spelling thing no errors this time round yeah it's a slow day"

Instead I'm updating and listening to Overnight Celebrity for the 500 thousandth time, it's an annoying song that the thing but that not bothering me.

I'm leaving tomorrow to go to the home because i gonna be home for easter weekend. I don't really want to go home but I realize I probably should. Seeing as how last weekend ended with me going to the waffle house at 4 in the morning with a cowboy hat with two guys I just met. But for what it's worth they were both really nice. Plus one wore a grass skirt and sombrero while the other kept it simple in a cowboy hat. Now if thats not good people I don't know what is. Yeah there won't be any of that this weekend. 


500 words?? I can do it....tomorrow I'm really tired and will probably regret this in the morning but it really just seems like a great idea now.

On that note night night kiddos....

   which ones the daughter and which ones the girlfriend
3- i now know the name o the guy who has been calling that i gave my number to 
   because i felt bad....yeah he called AGAIN ...but see I thinked on my toes this 
   time and just said I wasn't here--that amazes me that you can do that

"event","Ok so apparently I no longer need to go out of the country. 
This weekend I met people from all over the world. Well not people actually now that I think about it I met guys from all around the world. Friday was the two guys...one from Bosnia the other from Turkey. 

Then later on Saturday I met a guy from Venezuela...at least I think he was so drunk that I really had no idea what he was saying half the time. All I know is that he was very offended by the fact that I wouldnt say Luis with a spanish accent...it wasnt that I couldnt do it I just found it highly amusing that it was upset him so much. Plus he was making me mad opening my jacket and talking about roommates or something like that. Then I met David...from Ecuador who taught me some dances, and kept telling me about the one move he would use if he wanted to kiss me...I decided that wasnt going to happen and kept distracting him by asking him to teach me different move. Then I met another Luis...I don't remember where he was from though, who I had help me look for Lauren when I couldnt find her...he found her but I felt really bad about that whole situation...I really didnt think they were in that room. I met the guy who lived there, dont remeber where he was from but from his accent Im pretty sure it wasnt here he kept telling me how his home was my home...drunk people are so giving. He told me that I wasnt allowed to hook up with Luis which he took back as soon as he said and told me that he was the best looking roommate he has ever had. Ever ever ever forever...I swear thats an actual quote, the two of them decided that was very gay sounding and stopped on that subject. He then introduced me to his friend from who he referred to as his substitute which  I didnt understand but he explained that he took over his room at his old apartment so he could live where he does now. Later I learned how to dance some more with a guy whose name I dont remembr...he was from Kenya, which amazed me for some reason and I think it was because he was the first guy I met there who wasnt from South America. He explained to me that he was going to Germany after he graduates and how he loves hanging out with the latin crowd because they know how to party...and he proceeded to tell me about how I should come to Spain with him for the summer because the guys he lives with are from there and they will give me a house if I go there.

All in all I learned that I no longer need to go to South America because I can find the entire country in one apartment. A language barrier makes things very interesting. I should always be sober because its highly entertaining to watch drunk people. Oh and everybody who speaks spanish knows everyone who speaks spanish...which I guess in Gainesville almost makes sense.

And now I'm going to sleep because a- I havent slept much this weekend and in that case I havent slept in my own bed at all this weekend and b- I have to continue the trend of getting no work for school done"

"event","Happy Weekend!! Ok so it's over but that means five days until the weekend. I believe that would be an optimistic way to look at the situation. Plus short time after that and it's spring break. Which of course I would be a little more excited about if I were doing anything but I also excel at doing nothing so I think I will try that for a little while. 

I am sitting in my room right now...avoiding all work that relates to school, which explains the updating. This weekend I took the CLAST which kind of sounds like a test for something else and not for school but thats besides the point. Five hours that bastard took. It blows the mind that a test can last for five hours but never mind that because it's over now and heres to hoping I passed all three sections...and if not I'm taking the mature route and switching majors. After that went and saw behind the ropes or something like that. Haven't been to the movies in forever so good times. Went to get ice cream with caroline and ari...""Yeah but it's ok because it's not like I have any STD's or anything"" A- everyone should have had a chance to see ari's face and B- that statement really should not be relevant to me...but it is. I have a new rule when it comes to guys...basically just don't do what I did last weekend and I'm set for life. Friends should not be able to discuss umm... size, if you will, of the same guy. That's all I'm sayin bout that.

Today was a good day up until now...two things sex and the city is on right now and I'm staring at a computer screen and there is a mother in my apartment whom I equate with the devil. But it's all good in tha hood because thats what they made headphones for. Plus...Sex and the City is only a half hour so in 25 minutes it wont matter that you have HBO and I don't. Plus if you watch sex and the city you are sooo missing regis philbins triumphant return to that shitty show where folks win the dollas....holla 

(And why when I spell check this entry does dollas and holla not show up as mispelled)...yeah I'm done ...."

Woke up at 820 today and even got out of bed. Yeah..and I ate breakfast and ...heres the clincher....I went to my 935. Even though I had the notes and knew that the only thing my professor was going to do was take 50 minutes to read them line by line, I went. I decided I should grace him with my presence. Never mind the fact that it's a large auditorium...that's not the point. The point is I actually went, learned nothing but did get a chance to read the newspaper so I guess that kinda made up for it. 

Volunteered today. Yeah nothing interesting happened there so I'm just gonna leave that as a thing I did today.

Oh I went to Moe's and of course was ""Welcome(d) to Moe's"" because a trip to moe's just wouldn't be complete without the greeting. Went to the grocery store too. 

Went for a walk too. For the second day in a row. Also for the second day in a row saw an alligator in Lake Alice...although today I saw two which equals out to one more than yesterday. Very nice. 

I really should be getting my work done right now to meet the mental 10 o'clock deadline I have set for myself. You see after ten is tv time. Intellectually stimulating shows such as the real word and rich girls are on during that time period. And I can't not watch them. It would go against all that I stand for. Haha... But really though the Real World is educating, they are in Paris. 

And this is why I haven't updated in so long. A- Because I have nothing intersting to say and B- I sound sorta crazy

And I didn't forget that I went to Boston either... I just figured that everyone covered the basics...so see Vanessas expenditure list and Laurens Really Really long entry I did all that minus the coach purse. Plus theres all the pictures. Plus I don't really feel like writing anymore.

I am avoiding studying right now. But thats not the reason I am updating...you see when I want to kill time now, I watch the World Series. Don't get me wrong...I hate baseball more than a lot of things. But I do enjoy picking a team and then cheering for them until the end. I want the Yankees to win. This makes my entire family mad. I was talking to my mom earlier and she told me that the Yankees have already won the world series enough times and my dad calls them the best team money can buy. But I tell them they weren't Marlins fans for the entire baseball season and now that they happen to be in the World Series they are their number one fans. And to this I say I have been to a Yankees game...and I even have a hat. So i'm set. 
Plus I maintain that nothing good has ever came out of miami. No one has proven this theory incorrect....And even though this is going to disappoint Lauren NO Ricky Martin still does not count. Haha.

Anyway tomorrow is volunteering again. Different kids than my Tuesday kids...these kids don't speak english so they don't tell me about ""sexual reproduction"" or the ""mental kid"" I tell ya what I have a lot of fun volunteering.

Went to the oaks today...representin for all those who still rock Belk. Lauren parked in the expectant/new mothers parking spot because it was the closest to the door. That and it was the only space open because it was national townie day. Good times included an inflatable dog and a man in a cow suit reppin chick-fil-a. We were followed around by a creepy guy and only realized it when he walked into the womens side of hollister and just so happened to let us walk in front of him every time we moved. No no son we are smarter than that. We walked out faster than you should when in a retail establishment...but I was willing to explian the power walk to the exit if confronted by an employee. We ended up spending way too long in the mall. Over two hours even though the mission was based on finding laurens dad a birthday present. The time was mainly spent in GITI a store with more designer knockoffs than broadway. We tried on dresses and took pictures...fun times. Lauren ended up buying a shirt and I ended up buying a pair of pants...all for tonight because we were going out no matter what. Right now those pants are sitting in a Publix bag...another place I went today...with 75 cents sitting close by...
Caroline, Lauren and i all went downtown tonight not knowing where we were going but knowing we were going somewhere. We stood in line at one club only to find out that it was 21 and up...so we forged ahead. We ended up going to Sky...outdoor nightclub on the roof of the only other club i've ever heard of :08. Within the first 2 minutes we met a really hot guy..and I mean hot guy...Carlos, who currently has Carolines number and she's waiting for him to call.Oh how I wish the story ended there....
Tired now and would rather not think about the next part of the stroy...So I'm gonna leave it as a sort of to be continued type situation. Haha. Trust me it's best for my mental health...at least let me wash the pants first."

I think there is probably another term for this, but I literally went outside, got some grass, stuck it between my fingers and blew on it. It's all Laurens fault, she couldn't believe that I didn't know how to do it...so she decided to teach me. And there was some other whistling thing we tried but you had to squeeze your tongue and apparently we werent squeezing hard enough or something like that. 
I should be studying right now. I have been so good. I studied for an hour. For an exam I don't even have until next Wednesday. I'm trying that whole studying ahead thing so I don't start the readings two days before the exam. I'm gonna try it out and see how it works. Although I'm already doing a bang up job because I should be studying right now. But thats ok...we will call this a mental break. 
Real World is on tonight. I think this season is very boring and pointless...but they are in Paris so I will watch it...because Europe amazes me. I'm easily amused what can I say.
But until then I will read...about the Earth and its formation and freakin plate tectonics...because it interests me.

Went to educational technology today...only class of the day, very nice. I did find it very funny that he couldn't get any of the programs he wanted to demo to work. The only thing I have taken away from that class thus far is a new found hatred for macs. I didn't used to care... hell for a long time I didn't even know there was a difference. 

I started volunteering today...I went into the office to ask where the class was the I was supposed to volunteer in and this lady takes me aside and tells me that my midriff is showing and they even send their own kids home for that. She told me that next time I would need to wear a jacket. I was thinking a longer shirt because afterall this IS Florida and it IS about a million give or take a few degrees outside. And just for the record it wasn't a midriff baring shirt because I don't wear those I leave them for the whores to buy...but I wasn't about to argue. To top it off she didn't even tell me where the classroom was...she pointed to the two people sitting at the front desk who ignored me earlier and told me ""they"" would help me. They finally did and I felt hardcore when I didn't thank the lady because she was a bitch...yeah I'm sure that pissed her off.

I am volunteering for quite possibly one of the coolest guys I've ever met so I am excited. He spent the whole time talking to me about teaching and he was just really helpful overall. 

8 DAYS!!!!!! Technically 7 days because today is really almost over. PANERA opens then...yeah it's gonna make everyone want to move to g'ville now I know. Be jealous.

So now I actually have to absorb the material that I have ""learned"". I am making every attempt to procrastinate...which you can probably tell by the fact that I am updating my journal. I'm really excited though because my sister called me to tell me that she was going to NYC for New Year's Eve...and naturally I told her that I hated her and I was coming with tooo!! We will see how that goes though because my mom didn't believe me when I told her I was going to go. I don't even have to be back at school until the 6th so I could even walk home in time to be back in time for school. And a one way ticket back from New York can't be THAT expensive .... can it?? 
I grocery shopped Publix today and emptied my refrigerator of lettuce that has been there for a little over three weeks. And milk that went bad a week and a half ago. Ahh I'm even boring myself writing this...I really really dont want to study. I think thats a disorder. 
The ride up here was pretty uneventful...listend to John...John I love you....but you put me to sleep. Woke back up after the ""SHOW US YOUR BOOBS"" sign cracked me up. Gotta give it to the guys...not only was it in bubble letters...they filled in each letter...artists I tell ya.
This weekend all I did was study. Friday: I had every intention of studying but ended up watching Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Sex and the City...in my book this counted as studying after all I did learn a new phrase ""let's motor"". Plus I blame it on Starbucks who kept the temp. too cold making the place unsuitable for a studying atmosphere. Saturday: I actually did STUDY!!! and Sunday: I really did study again.

It's recommended that you change it, otherwise you risk having your journal hijacked. Now I'm not paranoid or anything but I am bored...so I decided to humor the message and change my password. Not as easy as originally planned 
Attempt #1: Bad new password: Your password cannot be based on your real name (yes, I first   tried to throw my name in there)
Attempt #2: Bad new password: it does not contain enough DIFFERENT characters (I really did try to repeat the same word)
Attempt #3&4: Bad new password: it is based on a dictionary word (technically isn't everything a word in the dictionary...I mean hell even bling bling can be found in some dictionaries...and even if it's not their idea of a dictionary word then it still does not contain enough DIFFERENT characters)
So my new goal in life as a twenty something haha is to be a better password maker.

Scratch the did part because there wasn't much of that. So i didn't exactly write the ENTIRE five pages...but in the long run three is just as good as five in my opinion. Oh and she gave me back my quiz that I was supposed to get on Monday but I decided that I didn't need to go on Monday...105...on a book I didn't read. I impressed myself...I was shocked and almost blurted out ""Wow and I didn't even read that book"" but something stopped me, although I think her face woulda been classic. 

I have decided that if I ever quit school to become a hooker/stripper-- woman of the night type thing I will at least wait until there is a J Crew warehouse sale because they got some boots that could get  me into the business. Exciting to know that option always exsists...and only $20!! Not for me...shit I'd be one of the expensive ones. Haha Anyway 20 bucks for boots for hooker boots that don't have the clear plastic heel...not bad.

I need to watch my stats lecture today. That gets more and more difficult every time. I apparently have developed a raging case of ADHD. I blame it on my oceanography professor who makes class about 15 minutes long so ""we can all get outta here."" It's good to know that he too thinks the class is a complete waste of time. 

I'm almost done with my volunteering! I will not be sad worry not. This is a happy thing for me. It get me up at 8:20 every Thursday morning...if I didn't have to go there I wouldn't have to get up until 5:20. But apparently I hated myself back in January when I signed up to volunteer at 9 in the morning.

On my way back to sleep this morning my roommate stops me to ask if it was cold outside? ??? I looked at her like she was crazy certifiably insane and told her no. Welcome to Florida!! I don't know how long you have lived here but I done been here all my life. It's APRIL--- meaning beginning of spring which is really summer here. Forecast high upper 70's- low 80's with a low in the 60's. Followed by June and July with high of 90's and low of 80's upper 70's if you are lucky. The weather here is very predictable..oh and don't forget the chance of rain. Either way the cool front last week was a complete fluke...meaning the chance of another one coming through is about the same as the chance of me actually saying shes my bestest friend ever.

I got a dress stuck on me today. It was pretty funny because when you try something on in a fitting room and you run into problems you can solve them without someone else seeing. However...when you try it on in a crowded room everyone sees your struggle I even had Lauren help me get the damn thing off. It was cute though...I wanted the dress so much but it didn't want me. Well I guess it did...a little too much so I told it I had to break up with it because it was suffocating me...I need my space."

No seriously if puddle jumping was an olympic event I wouldn't even need to practice, I would just show up and take the gold. And I, unlike some people I know (won't mention names but Lauren knows who she is) have never fallen on slippery surfaces (in public). Only once walking up the stairs and it wasn't even raining or wet...come to think of it there was no excuse for that so I will blame it one my shoes.

This was made painfully obvious when I couldn't sign onto the computer to locate a journal because I hadn't activated my card. Yeah I have been here almost 2 full semesters and have not had to check out a book. But I am now a card toting member of the library society...it makes me feel good, accepted even. Haha maybe not. I now know how to find a journal and no longer need to go to the help desk to ask questions that begin with ""I don't think I'm doing this right"". Anyone have questions about the library...just ask me I will point you in the wrong direction but I will do it in a way that makes you think I know what the hell I am talking about!!

   I learned how to play spades this weekend. I have a grasp on the whole thing right now but I think my family doubted my skillz because I was always paired up with someone. I never actually got to play my own hand. Which was probably a good move. That was the first card game I have ever had to play where bluffing was something you WEREN'T supposed to do. But I would still do it anyway and every time someone would tell me I wasn't supposed to I said ok and did it the next round anyway. Force of habit...hard shit to break you know? I am stubborn in my card game playing ways. I'm a black jack pimp by the way. If I actually believed in throwing my money, my daily grande valencia iced teas and cinnamon walnut cake excluded (a girls gotta eat), I would go to Vegas and play until I earned enough money to stay in one of those pimped out high roller suites they show on the Travel channel to make people with average incomes jealous. By the way, the previous about me being really good at blackjack are embellished. I'm not good, when I played it at my grad night party I was given all the chips and lost them all within a two minute period...and was mocked by the ""dealer"" (aka the volunteer dad). But my dreams of staying in one of the high roller suites was completely true."

"event","I only seem to update my life when I am trying to avoid doing important things. Well not necessarily important by everyones standards but hey. This is my procrastination outlet. I am trying to write a paper but I can't seem to make a coherent sentence so I wait...for the thoughts to come I guess. 
  With only 22 days of school left I have taken on a new angle as far as dorm decorations go. All past attempts at decoration have resulted in horrible failure, mainly with things falling on my head because the walls don't let me stick anything on them. I will give props to my mirror it has only fallen off the wall twice, both times hitting me in the head but it's now half propped half stuck to the wall. Anyway though I used tacks and put all my syllabi above my desk along with a print out calendar of March and April and the ""UF approved calendar 2002-2003 Academic Calendar"" on each of these pieces of paper I have created some form of a countdown till the end of school. It serves two purposes 1. On the outside it appears as though I am a highly organized student (although one look at the desk below will prove that theory wrong) and 2. It makes me happy to see the countdown everyday....all I have to do is look up and it's right there in all it's shiny glory. 
  My cell has been ""looking for service"" for the past 45 minutes (I'm not even exaggerating the facts like I normally do) I could find service quicker than that...technology makes me so dependent...but I will have you know the I am an Independent Woman...just like Destiny's Child says...I'm throwing my hands up right now...wooo. 
  The weather has been very nice but I can't get my windows open which makes me very sad...but I try every damn day and one of these days I will get them opened...today will not be that day. I have already tried twice and frankly I don't want to feel like an idiot anymore today...I will leave that for tomorrow. 
  Ok now I really need to write me paper....and it's not like it's a hard paper. So i should just stop bitching and take my own advice and just get it over with. If only I actually listened to myself."

"event","I update today at the request of a friend. That and the fact that I feel like I have something to write, which I confuse very easily with procrastination. When i procrastinate I ramble. I also ramble when I'm really tired but I've had something to wake me up (ex. food or caffeine). Today I am both---avoiding schoolwork and tired but I just dined on fine cuisine I shall refer to by name...Pasta Anytime. I like this for its sheer ability to be done in only 3 minutes...some people may be frightened by this. Pasta done in 3 minutes?? Ahh yes, sure italians may gasp by the thought of eating pasta out of a microwaveable plastic green box...but I do not. I embrace its ability to cook quickly in a disposable yet durable container. That and the fact that I also refer to spaghetti o's as italian food too. Another quick meal but less desirable for two reasons 1-it tastes like can and 2-it requires the use of my precious disposable bowls. Other than that though Essa left today, she came here yesterday and chilled up in G'ville. I don't think she will ever want to come back...my mistake I took her to my oceanography class. I SWEAR they aren't all that boring I promise!! Come back? Please! We attempted to clear her of her ticket today, but were confronted with paperwork instead of an ""ok no problem we'll take care of this for you"" We gave ourselves 40 minutes on the parking meter to make sure we didn't run out of time and she didn't get another ticket. But it's not like we were completely law abiding. We backed out of the space she was originally in and went into the one that these girls left because they still had time on their meter. So we half-ass follow law. They like doing two things here giving tickets and putting boots on cars. I think Vanessa was a little freaked out and secretly thought her car wasn't going to be in the spot she left it in because they would of towed her car. But let me tell you thats only if you get 5 tickets. Hmmm 5 tickets at $20 and $100 to get your car back....I should be in charge of parking here. As long as I get to keep all the money...I would walk around as a meter maid with a big freakin grin on my face. Must keep all options open when it comes to careers am I right? Anyway I think I have to do real work now. Damn and I was doing so good doing nothing."

"event","Today is my first day of anthropology...to be honest I didn't know what that was until the other day. And then when i looked up course description it said an introductory course to anthropology. I turned to the dictionary. I hope I like it? If not thats why they made drop/add my friend...although I myself am more fond of the droppage than the other option. The professor has to be better than psychology...that ma was the quintessential devil professor. The one who's thinks he's the greatest there ever was and doesn't give a shit about his students just as long as he can hear himself talk. He's so old you never know when class is going to be canceled because he finally croaked. So now it's anthropology...I looked him up...he's not old he reminds me of the crocodile hunter and I'm not quite sure why. 
 As a student I get abnormally excited when I find new food that can be eaten by me during the week so I don't have to eat Subway...the only tolerable food on campus...which quickly becomes intolerable when you have it three nights in a row. Not that I'm not all for sandwiches or anything...in fact I love sandwiches...I'm not ashamed to say I grew up being peanut butter and jelly's number one fan. Oh and when I found out you could put marshmallow on peanut butter I ate one everyday. However, here at school that gets old..quick. Anyway back to what I was saying rice cakes...I bought them on Sunday and it is now Thursday...eating stale rice cakes is similar to gnawing on cardboard...i tastes like shit and you feel like you are doing something wrong to yourself. They were good when i first opened them. So my new rule is when i get rice cakes I have to eat the entire thing that day. Oh trust me...it can be done. 
 To clean my teeth has now become an extremely time consuming and difficult process. I have to bring with me toothpaste, toothbrush, my invisalign case, mouthwash and my soap. Carrying a shitoad of stuff to the bathroom I am aware looks odd...but I care not. Anyway though I have to clean my braces things with listerine every time because if I didn't that would just be wrong. But I read an article the other day that listerine is the homeless alcoholics drink of choice. So as I'm cleaning them I used too much listerine and I suddenly felt like a horrible person. I am in possession of the most sought after drink by crazy homeless people who could pass out if they don't get there fix and here I am just letting it go down the drain. It's like walking by a person with one of those ""hungry please help"" signs and throwing away your mickey d's food in the trash can right next to them. Albeit
in case number two the person actually sees you being an asshole but you get what I mean. So I have decided to try and conserve my listerine as best as I can dammit. And thats how iI am going to make the world a better place...one orthodontic piece at a time."

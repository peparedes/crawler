<img src=http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2743/raneypicasosmall5bg.jpg>
Me like Pablo Picasso by Matt Raney
This one is actually a year old, but I still stand by the fact that this is the best caricature I've ever had drawn. It breaks every single caricature drawing rule, then makes up some rules and breaks those, but it still manages to look exactly like me. Of my many caricatures, this is the only one I actually keep hung up.

<img src=http://img479.imageshack.us/img479/6219/laurenlittlemermaidsmall4kz.jpg>
John, Javier, and Me as the cast of The Little Mermaid by Lauren Hale
After 4 years of drawing it on other people I finally managed to get myself drawn like a mermaid. I feel so pretty. I especially like how different she was able to make John and I look (we are twins).

The rest of these are in a handy dandy <lj-cut text=""cut"">
-
<img src=http://img482.imageshack.us/img482/1682/javieractionsmall0ar.jpg>
Me in Escape from New York by Javier Gonzales
This is the best body I've ever had drawn on a caricature. Look at that shit. I told him to draw me in some kind of action/b-movie type of setting, so he drew me surfing with a machine gun on a tidal wave out of a giant whole through New York with a pimp in a convertable flipping me off on the side of the road. Awesome.
-
<img src=http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/1588/javier2minsmall4wn.jpg>
Me in less than 2 minutes by Javier Gonzales
As a practice excercise we all had to draw a kid playing videogames in under 2 minutes. Javier, of course, drew me. This looks great, especially considering he wasn't even looking.
-
<img src=http://img459.imageshack.us/img459/5620/laurenmaxsmall2qu.jpg>
Me hugging Max by Lauren Hale
Lauren didn't like this one because she messed up on my hand, but I like it anyway. That's a great picture of Max. Also, she threw in some acne at no extra charge.
-
<img src=http://img459.imageshack.us/img459/7059/raneysimple1fc.jpg>
Me drawing by Matt Raney
I wasn't there when Raney drew this but I found it in the pile of practice caricatures. I think he added on about 120 pounds here for whatever reason, but I really like his use of lines in the face.

</lj-cut>

This is seriously one of the best jobs ever. It doesn't even feel like work. They're adding a bunch of new things to the park this year too, so I'm pretty excited.
Maybe one day I'll post a caricatures I've drawn.

This is a word-for-word mock phone conversation I had with Raney when we were talking about money and all the wonderful things you can't do without it. I realized when I drew this it was pretty much A Jon Arbuckle talking on the phone gag, so I threw Garfield in there.

JR hasn't paid the rent on time in three months. The last two times he was close and he paid us back soon, but this time he's lost his job and has no prospects. He kept telling us all month he still had some money for rent! Why would he wait 'till the last minute???? Who DOES that?

Post if you still read these so I can get an idea of my audience. Thanks :)

Today I went out to find some NES games and it appears that they don't sell 'em at most places anymore. Ever since we moved out to Arlington I haven't been able to find any good spots to collect.
So eventually we ended up at an old giant thrift store. They didn't have any NES games but they had a TON of amazingly old computer games for only a buck fitty each. We picked up:

Kings Quest 2
Kings Quest 3
Kings Quest 4
Space Quest 1
Space Quest 2
Elvira Mistress of the Dark
Elvira 2 The Jaws of Cerberus
Conan the Cimmerian
The Immortal
Conquest of Camelot
Orbitus
Future Wars

As it turns out The Immortal and Orbitus only came with their 5 1/4th floppys. You know, the B:/ ones. Unfortunately there was no way to figure that out in the store. We're going to e-mail the companies and see if we can trade them out for 3 1/2"" ones (some places still offer that).

Anyway, as it turns out these things took FOREVER to install. I had to install a MSDOS emulator since Windows 9x is not DOS based. The emulator doesn't make much since, but I've gotten it tied down. It looks like I ruined the files on the Elvira disk though. We'll see.
All in all it was a fun-filled afternoon for only around $18.50. But since everything came full in their boxes and instructions I've got to find a place to put all this crap.


Lastly, anyone who hasn't heard from me since I last posted here, please check out my deviant gallery at http://yooki42.deviantart.com/ as I've done a lot of neat stuff lately."

I've been playing Paper Mario 2 lately. I have almost beat it. I like it a heck of a lot more than Paper Mario 1, and only a little less than Superstar Saga (which I LOVED). So, here's the final standing from best to not-so-best:

1. Super Mario RPG - One of the greatest games ever. One of the funniest games I've ever played, with an excelent replay value. There isn't a single NPC in this game that is not a riot to talk too. Good music too. I liked how epic this one seemed too.
2. SuperStar Saga - Mario and Luigi together. Funny, creative, and plenty of great extra characters. Very fun, and it pulled no syops in having a great ending and boss battles.
3. Paper Mario 2 - Not far behind Superstar Saga. There are some fundamental problems with the way the cast members are used, but each cast member (aside from Maam Flurrie) is awesome. A good number of the extras are fun too (like Rawk Hawk and Dupliss), but some (like Flavio and the Detective Guy) are unberrible. Some parts of this game can seem like work, but overall this is a very fresh, fun game.
I love Bobbery and Ms Mous. We need more characters like these.
135. Paper Mario - I really don't like this game too much. The Peach parts we fun, but nearly all your partners are borring (aside from Bow) and most of this game seems like work (the ShyGuy Toolbox, the desert, the Lakiluster's dang flower level...). Most of the extras were borring, and after I'd beat it, there were absolutley no secrets I hadn't uncovered, and no reason to replay."

"event","The Incredibles > Finding Nemo
I am tired of every single review of this movie on the face of this earth starting out with ""Okay, well, so it wasn't as good as Finding Nemo, but...""
SERIOUSLY. Every second of this film was an artistic masterpiece. And it was funnier on way more levels than Finding Nemo. And had more twists and curves in the plot. And the musice was cooler. The whole MOVIE was just plain cooler. And the mom was hot.
Hey, let's hear it for Pixar pulling off a 3-D movie that stars human cartoon characters.
It felt like to me that this was a 3-D animated version of a 2-D cartoon, rather than a 3-D animated version of reality (which is the feeling Shrek gives me, and I've always found it a little dishartening).
I like The Incredibles because it wasn't just a comedy. It was and ACTION comedy, and I feel can compete with the top action movies out there. My bawls were rawked the whole way through."

This is a chalk drawing I did on the wall of Picard Hall at UTA. After I got the idea and printed up the refrence picture Matt Raney and I got together and did this early in the morning. It took us about an hour and a half to two hours (neither of us happened to keep track). We devided the bricks each into square sized blocks and then used the squares as pixels to redraw the art. 
Although we started out in the desolate early morning, by the time we finished the campus was bustling with people and onlookers.
Over the course of the next few days, we observed as people laughed and pointed at him. Everyone enjoyed it. Many took out digital cameras and got their picture taken next to him.
I just did this for fun, but it ended up cheering up a lot of people. I guess this is my community service for the month then =)

<a href=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/luigichk05.jpg>A Closer Picture of Luigi</a> - As you can see, he is a little wide. This is because of the brick's shape. Whenever you are walking to or away from him though he evens out.

<a href=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/luigichk08.jpg>Detail Closeups</a> - Guess what parts of the picture I zoomed in on! YOu can see here how we devided the bricks up to account for the cement divisions.

<a href=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/luigichk01.jpg>The Article in the School Paper</a> - Well, not really an article, but it got some notice. I thought this was great!

(Note, this is Luigi only because we didn't have any red chalk. We only had pinks, and refused to draw a pink Mario!)"

Look out for Mel. He'll pound you in your pooter 'till your butt bleads. Virgil has always been one of my all time favorite know it all charcters. I like Queen Valanice because she fills the very small ""old aged, rich but humerous woman"" demographic in videogames. PQ, though very annoying, is just too crazy for me to pass up."

"event","For those of you that don't know, Becky and I have seperated. We were in a long relationship, and I loved her through all of it, and still love her now, but I am weak and could no longer cope with her leaving to New York and coming back and leaving again. I think the relationship had also become a stronger responsibility than it was anything else. But I guess it had to be under the circumstances. I kept waiting for things to get better, but they never did. I don't know if they ever would have. Maybe.
The security was nice though. I really had planned to marry her. I've kind of torn my future to pieces now, and don't know which way is up. I'll find it though.

It has also come to pass that I am now dating Jessica Hale, a friend of mine from work. She draws really cute caricatures, and she is a very happy person. We are alike, both very clumsy and pretty dumb. I like her a whole whole lot, but I'm having trouble being the dominant person in our relationship. I hve trouble being the dominant person in any situation. I feel like I've done some things wrong with Jessica, and that our pacing has been entirely off. But we'll bang out the kinks, I think.
Here's a picture of here as drawn by Amy:

<img src=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/jessamy.jpg>

Pretty darn accurate, actually. Would you expect any less from Amy?
Here are some pictures Jessica drew of me and her:

<img src=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/jessheart.jpg><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/jessheart2.jpg>

Cute, isn't it? I told you so.

And just to clear things up, I didn't break up with Becky to go out with Jessica. Jessica was sort of a catalyst, but the day I knew our relationship had to go on hold was when she told me she was going back to New York again even though she was not going to attend NYU. That had destroyed my heart and I knew I wan't going to be able to take that anymore. I'm sorry I'm weak.

And I'm sorry you all had to listen to this mush.
I'm usually the one that doesn't make these kinds of posts, but what can I say?"

Anyway, we bought a new scanner. And since we did, I decided to scan in a bunch of the stuff I've been drawing at work lately since Daniel showed some intrest.

<img src=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/work/Michael/worktim01.jpg>

Before you check this out Daniel, there's a few things you should know (I don't know what you know and what you don't, so I'll just go over it all):
Here's all the artists that currently work for us:
Javier Gonzales (who is now a manager), Lauren Hale (who's sort of built like Javier, they have taken a liking to eachother), Me, John, Matt Raney (He's Back), Amy Goreman (John's ex-girlfriend who recently became his girlfriend again after working with us for a while), Jason Robbins (One of Chance's friends), Chance McGee (We now cal him ""Gator"", after Gator McGee's resteraunt; he has also formede a habit of always being over 30 minutes late to any shift; also, he sports a fro now), and lastly, Tim Duran (the same old, awesome Tim).
There are a series of images here where we drew members of Big Time as foods. This was due to a truly horrid 2nd grade drawinf someone (nobody knows who, it was proably a tattoo guy) posted of Jason as a Donut, which created an entire spin-off of other members as foods.

Yeah, well, here's the directory: http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/work/

http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/work/Michael/workmario.jpg is probably my favorite. Try to figure out who everyone is and post it in my comment section. I'll let you know who you got right =)"

OMG, I've just been up for like an hour trading crappy computer art with Amy! Here are some of the better ones we did

<lj-cut text=Look!!>
After her gemins one I did a few of her like this one:
<img src=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/amz2.jpg>
 

Then I told her to draw a spider crab. She of course made this crotch-related.
<img src=http://webpages.charter.net/thegormans/amez/spidarkrabz.jpg>


I liked how that one was full body so I did a large one as well:
<img src=http://webpages.charter.net/skidrow/amz4.jpg>


Which lead to this one by her. Don't worry. It is equally as crotch related as her last.

I just wanted to say I don't think I'm really gonna write in lj anymore.. I'm gonna keep the account to look at other people's stuff, make comments and put stuff on the Uphi page if i need to...  haha, so don't worry. But if you wanna keep up to date with my life, feel free to visit my myspace- I post blogs there every once in a while and it basically talks enough about me. So feel free to check that out:
http://www.myspace.com/chrissyros.

I'll keep checking and might update every once in a while though- it just seems to get me in trouble, no matter what I keep writing sometimes--Every one have a save and happy new years!!! I'm gonna try to, we'll see what happens...
~Chrissy"

"event","Ugh, I think im getting sick again-- this time maybe its a stomach virus... yuck.

The past few days have been cool- visited people up in Allentown and Millersville and now I am finally back home for good. Mama drama has resurfaced with my sister and her ex boyfriend regarding the baby. I have been helping my sister with the baby and trying to give her time to figure out the situation. Her ex boyfriend turned out to be a complete dick. Because of this I have decided to never have kids until I am officially married.

Grades came in and I was pleasantly shocked in a good way! I was happy enough to have a celebration last night. Emily, Janine, Jackie, Jess, Amy, Mikey, Kimmie and her friend Erin, Harant and Gibson were all over- we did a big power hour and just chilled. I was very drunk and it was a good night. I was shocked my parents actually let me have people over to party- that rarely happens around here.

My job sucks nowdays- my bosses have become assholes and I'm getting like 13-14 hours a week with minimum pay. This is it for Pmark, and this time I mean it. I dont even work in PIC anymore except Thursdays- they cant give me the damn hours. I already have a job lined up this summer with Luis, my sisters current boyfriend...its telemarketing but i already have experience with that, and its like $7-10 an hour and I make my own schedule. 

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays all! Don't forget the reason for the season but make sure to get excited and leave Santa his cookies!! Love you all<3<3"

Self control is 8%.... shocking right? haha.

DMB the other night was amazing!! We had quite a fiasco getting down there and I feel terribly about my friend Jackie losing her tickets. However, when we did get there, my little brother and his friend met this ticket seller from Ebay and ended up getting SEVENTH ROW SEATS! So Janine and I took their original seats which were in the 100 level to the side of the stage. They were pretty awesome seats and we had a great time. It was the first night I wasn't worried about a paper, what I had to get done before next semester, etc. While one might say the encore was a little lacking, the set was excellent!

Speaking of next semester, I think I might actually have a place to live. A friend of mine-Jan from English classes, had a problem with her roommate this semester and she is moving out next semester. So she mentioned to me that the place in the room would be opening up, and asked if I was interested in moving in so I said sure. Its pretty much a done deal! I'm pretty excited to actually have a roommate I know and like, and my best buds Sam and Matt as down the hall neighbors!<3

Yesterday I went up to talk to the chair of the Education Department about student teaching. She gave me the paper work- and it basically comes down to this! All I need to do is try and take some kind of ""G"" class this summer or next year- and take Media over the summer. The 3 Education classes count as my ""D"" class. YES! This is good news- as long as I do relatively well in my classes I can graduate on time WITH teaching certification! After talking with her, I hung out all night at Matt and Sam's and played board games with them and their group of friends-- it was a good FRIENDLY environment and definitely what some of us needed. Earlier in the evening I ran into the lounge and jumped onto a couch and hit my head on the wood- I think I might have had a minor concussion which sucks but I am okay now. I just kept talking and didn't pass out. Sam, being the bestest of friends he is was very nice to take care of me.

My parents are having a party tomorrow night so that should be cool and than this weekend I'll have to figure out what is going on, depending on work. Hopefully all goes well and I'll see ya soon people<3<3

"event","Hey all-

Just a quick update.

Went back to work Monday--it was pretty rough remembering everything, but it looks like I'll mostly be up front anyway. Certain people have too many doubts in me there and this is probably the last time I'm gonna work there only for a change in scenery.

Viagra paper for Bio done
Lit paper is fucking HARD- everyone is having trouble. I did start though- I'm about a page and a half in and still searching for my second source. I had too many distractions today and yesterday and this weekend will be quality time with me, the library, and what I have to get done.
Still have to register for the PRAXIS I and pick up student teaching stuff.

Uphi rush was fun last night and it was good to see everyone. I hope I get to meet more of the prospective girls soon enough.

I have been very upset over a certain situation today but I am now going to acknowledge that in order to get it out of my head. After all-- I shouldn't fret-- Joey and Dawson may have spent many years not talking, but in the end they remained friends, and remained important to each other.

Its good to be back in the USA but I still feel like I'm missing something--oh yeah...maybe its that I'm terribly UNHAPPY! I do miss you Florence, as much as you drove me nuts sometimes.

Good luck with finals everyone! :)"

"event","I cant forget writing an update on BERLIN!! It was absolutely amazing. It was definitely my favorite place I have gone to in Europe...

The weather was really cold, in fact it even snowed, but this hardly put a damper on our perfect weekend. We arrived in Berlin late on Thursday night and went right to sleep.  On Friday morning we ended up walking around the whole city center ourselves and finding some really cool hotspots.  Amongst them were:  the oldest Jewish graveyard, a church, a big carnival, the Berlin cathederal and canals, Christmas trees!, STARBUCKS, and in the afternoon a trip the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. The Museum was particularly interesting because we learned how all of the people escaped over the Berlin Wall. Some people hid themselves in a speaker box--that one was pretty cool. During the evening, we went to the oldest Irish pub in Berlin to have dinner and some Strongbow and German beer. The night ended in us getting all of our food and drinks for free. These army guys from Kentucky and NYC came to the table and decided to buy us everything! I did my first carbomb there. I had a lot of fun with them but I am pretty sure they had alterior motives- as most guys do. However, I did get very drunk and Kate and I decided to join the kareoke night that was happening in the other part of the bar. We sang and everyone liked it. I never would have done that if I was sober b/c I would be too afraid. Singing in a choir is a bit different than at a kareoke bar in Germany where everyone is watching and hearing just you.

On Ssaturday morning, we had breakfast and then went back into town and did some more shopping and site seeing. We saw a portion of the Berlin Wall in the middle of town, and then went back out to the largest portion which is on the way out of the city. Unfortunately I only got pictures of the one portion. I am retarded with my damn camera. We ate lunch at a steakhouse and it was really amazing. Shopping was a huge success- I got some shoes!!!, underwear, sweaters, and some other souvenirs and stuff. Afterwards-we went to get our plane but it was DELAYED!!! Of course...just my like. I think it was a sign for me to stay in Berlin because it was my favorite place :P Kate and Catherine were making me nervous on the plane by sayng random lines from Ron White about crashing planes... not cool. Then, they had to ""de-ice"" (defrost) the wing of the plane before take off... after there were missing pilots...very encouraging. But, nevertheless, I got home and didn't die. 

OKAY- well finals are almost over, I have one final left and 2 presentations left and to finish rewriting a paper for English which seems to be coming along a lot better than the first time I tried to write it. Tomorrow is the last day I will have regular internet access. Then it will be very random until I go HOME!! So until then, everyone have a marvelous Thanksgiving and see ya soon :)

"event","I have been feeling really insecure about my relationship with Dan lately and I really dont know why. Sometimes I wish that he would act a certain way or do something more for me, and I cant make him do that. I think its just the distance thats making me insecure right now so I am sure when I get home everything will lighten up.

Last weekend I went to Sienna, which is a small down just south of Italy. I went to the St. Catherine church and saw the famous head of St. Catherine. I also spent some time in the one of the largest squares of Italy, Piazza de Campo--alot of cool fountains, Baroque Art and pigeons! Pretty cool stuff. Afterwards, we went to the Duomo there which was under renovation at the time. It was pretty funny because the front of it would probably have been one of the most beautiful entraces to a church I had seen in Italy but it was covered by a picture of it to hide the renovations.

This week I have been increasingly sick with the chills and a headache that could kill someone....BUT luckily its getting better and of course I will still be going to Berlin tonight for the weekend with Kate and Cath so I will definitely update after that!

Ciao,

"event","I find it interesting that two people who consist of an entire family keep so many things from each other. Whatever happened to family ties?? My host family which is the mother Anna, and her daughter Bianca are two of the nicest people I have ever met but they are seriously disfunctional. Bianca has been playing sick for a week and a half and refuses to go to school. Its kinda sad that whatever is bothering her she wont tell her mother about! It is obviously a serious problem because it has kept her home this long. The kicker was that she suddenly ""got better"" on Saturday night when I got home from Sienna and went to a party...but then was sick AGAIN on Sunday. And Anna, she has this boyfriend who she obviously wont bring into the home when Bianca is there. Bianca misses her father and wants him back but the divorce is over and Anna deserves to tell her the truth about the serious nature of her relationship with Alessandro, her boyfriend. If you ask me, I think my approaching departure will be a good opportunity for them to talk and reveal things to each other. I can see the tension- they need to see it.

Sorry that had nothing to do with anything, I just felt like sharing.

"event","Hey all--

I hope all is well with everyone. This weekend I went back to Rome for an Ursinus student trip. Suprisingly, I learned alot more about the ancient and modern city than I had did last time. Apparently, the Pantheon is now a modern day church and this is why it is still preserved today. I had never known that. The Vatican tour was a bit more informative this time, but I was shocked and appalled the many tourists were taking pictures inside the Sistine chapel and these particular guards were not doing anything...I definitely didnt see this the last time I was there. On Sunday, it rained all day when we were at the Colesseum and I think I got sick---blah.

The days have gone so fast--and we are almost homeward bound. I will try to update after my trip to Berlin next weekend but it might be tough. There is alot of work to do coming up in all classes. This is the time wheres its most important to stay strong and get things done. This weekend is going to mostly be dedicated to getting work done and next weekend having fun and working simultaneously.

Three weeks left--and I feel like I have made true school friends--something which I had definitely lost over the months that passed last year. And, I have gained alot perspective and knowledge. The only disadvantage of this trip was putting me behind in my studies--something I will have to work hard for when I get back. Volkmer suggested my graduating in 2007 with my English major then coming back for student teaching. It sounds like a luxurious idea but I still have the ambition to graduate with both backgrounds at the normal time. Providing that I can get the summer classes I need, i can pull this off. If not, I will be around for Fall of 2007.

Dan has been getting a bit wierd with me lately. He says that he is ""testy,"" which means he is too anxious about my return home and thats why hes acting this way. I find it wierd that sheer anticipation can make someone wierd? I dunno... I really hope is being truthful.

Other than that, not much going on...Clay and I did well on our Italian culture presentation which excited me. Tonight, we are cooking for another project...chestnut cake. Everyone loves a good chestnut here. Congrats UC to the rugby teams...apparently you all have done well and I am proud :)

Take care and see you all soon!!

"event","For anyone who has not heard yet. I was robbed. On Monday afternoon my cell phone was stolen out of my bookbag on the bus and things have sucked since then. I had to pay $200 for the loaned cell phone I lost that I cant return.

I have gotten a new one, but so far it doesnt work yet which sucks entirely. I am starting to really fucking frustrated. I never realized the implications of not having a cell phone. I am totally isolated...I never know what anyone is doing, I just have to show up places and hope I get lucky. My host mom has been nice enough to let Dan call the house the other night to talk but this still sucks.

My mom is trying to get me my job back for winter break but it looks like the my boss is on vacation, and they might not need me anyway. That sucks..I really liked that job and need the money.

In other news, Kate, Catherine and I are going to Berlin on Nov 17th for our final big trip before we leave Italy. I am glad to go somewhere else in Europe again before I get outta here.

I did well on my biology test we took last week..I got a 90%. This is the last time I am going to mention my performance so I dont jinx myself next time. I am just finally really happy that some hard work paid off for once.

This weekend I have to go to Rome again with Ursinus people which should be interesting I hope. I feel like I am doing everything twice but maybe I will learn something new...who knows? Ciao bitches.

"event","So nobody really had the money to do extensive travelling this weekend- so we stuck around here and had some basic Holiday fun.

To Brad, Sara, Tommy, Kate and Catherine--Thank you for making my first time so amazingly special.

Pumpkin Carving. I had never done it before-and wow, what a good time. We carved two big pumpkins, one with a scary face, and one with an outline of Italy. Then, Brad cooked the pumpkin seeds- and they tasted fucking awesome. Not entirely like chestnuts- but good :)

Yesterday we went shopping around--quite unsuccessfully for Halloween costumes. I am going to be the sex bunny because I found some cotton and a headband to make some ears. And I'm gonna draw a big ""1"" on a t-shirt and yeah its gonna be good.

Today I have a meeting with Volkmer for advising, then I have a presentation on the Florentine soccer team, and then a test. Tonight we're going to go to a costume/bar party perhaps. I'm about ready to come home...I miss you all- the Htown people, the pmark drama, uphi which hopefully isnt as dramatic as has been, that silly danimal kid, my other UC crew esp my dawson leery and of course my family. See you in a month :)

"event","Dawson and Joey's lives were always intertwined. Even though they didn't end up together, Joey was still a vital backbone for him for his entire life. While I might not speak as sophisticated as the actors in this dramatic television show, I am like Joey- and I have my Dawson. And the statement I'm about to make will definitely apply.

For all the assholes out there who are fucking with MY Dawson...I'm sorry for you, you're messing with one of the most amazing people... that there is in the world.

I dont know you...but dont fuck around... or I will know you.

Thanks for reading,
Chrissy :)"

"event","Since last week things have moved on a bit. The professor helped us look over our papers and ensured a review and paper conference for the next paper. I am still not entirely happy but what can ya do? I realized that I should be happy with what I can accomplish and be proud of that accomplishment. 

This weekend I went back to Venice with the crew and finally took my Gondale ride but made it all the well worth it. Saturday I came back to see the Fiorentina soccer match, which we had to go to for a project we are working on in Italian life and culture. It was really interesting...pretty damn intense! They were chanting like the whollllle time! I thought Eagles fans were intense back in Philly...wow.

This weekend is Halloween weekend and we plan on being pretty intoxicated the entire weekend and finding some kind of comic show in either Florence or Luca. Yes, I am dressing up as the sex bunny. I need to find the ears and write a 1 on a tshirt or something.

Hope all of you are doing well, and well still I am quite upset that I am receiving absolutely NO MAIL. Tia and Dan you are my heroes right now because you are the only ones that have sent me mail! Just a nice little letter..or even some email even! Haha. A simple request :) I am starting to get excited to come back and see all of you but am also going to cherish the friends and memories I have made here... all of which I will share as well. Rough week ahead with another bio test..i should peace.

Ciaaazzzao!

So bitches, tomorrow is fall break. I have one more class today then I am outta here and onto Rome, Venice, then back to Florence (Pisa and Siena as well) with the parents. I have made it through mid terms, and it has been a rough time academically. Otherwise, I love Italy, and I absolutely love my new friends here. I have a feeling we will still be good friends back at school. 

I guess I am a little bummed that Im not leaving the country and going to like Paris and Amsterdam like everyone else but Im sure it will be nice to see my parents, and I can say I have pretty much been everywhere in Italy that is of importance. At least Catherine and Kate have promised me my weekend in Ireland at some point ;) Everyone at home, I miss you and you should really start sending some mail my way cause I am getting lonely haha! take care everybody, if i dont talk to you enjoy YOUR fall break if it applies as well!!

"event","I am currently in a bit of a rut here.  I am a month into the semseter abroad and my grades keep going down, down down.  This happens every year. No matter how hard I work nothing seems to help the situation.  Every test I take I get ridiculously worried and no matter how much effort I put into the test it doesnt help.  I filled out an application for student teaching this week, realizing that I might not even be able to graduate in 2007. I have fallen behind gradewise, and am hardly meeting the standard GPA that I need. And I work twice as hard as anyone else. I am sick of this shit. From here on out, my classes are going to be significantly harder, I will eventually have a capstone next year and everything else. I hate having to continuously worry about this stuff. I wish I could be like my boyfriend who gets a 3.8 every fucking semester and doesnt have any trouble with school, which sort of makes me sick. This isnt fair anymore...that I have to worry about my future when eveyone else is having fun in Italy."

"event","For a while now I've gone on believing that I could have the best of both worlds.  I went on artifically believing that I could maintain a healthy relationship with someone I truly love, while stringing along another individual who I also happened to care deeply for which I cannot always whole-heartedly understand.  Yesterday I realized that this isn't possible, and I have lost one of these worlds.  Something tells me that this is just how things should be. And while I am pessimistic about how we will get on from here, I know that she is going to be a lucky girl and he is going to be happy.  It was selfish of me to drag him along- just plain wrong of me!! It's not who I am. It is time to finally put aside the feelings that we have and persist. For some odd reason, I believe that I may have more trouble with that than him... but the important part is that he is happy.

To the person that has stuck by me despite my faults and my annoyances, I thank you now Dan. You have made me happy and believed in me despite the confusion I have experienced and everything we've gone through for the past year. For a year I've loved you and I have never stopped...

Other than this, I'm not doing well in my classes and school here is hard for some reason. Someone tell me what I can do?  I'm enjoying Italy but I don't want to fail!!

"event","Ciao bitches,

So I am writing from London.  I am in the hostel waiting for the plane.  We had a very full weekend. I am mad tired but let me give you a quick run down of London.  

We arrived VERY LATE on Thursday evening.  In fact, we almost missed our damn plane!!  By the time we figured out how to get into London and got settled in at our hostel which was confusing and a joke it was about 3 in the morning.  We slept, woke up and went into town in Westminster- shopping, to a mall and a bunch of other stuff.  Later in the day, Clay and I ventured into the actual city and went to the British Museum which was cool and Russel Square.  Afterwards, we got fish and chips and went to a party at the other hostel, The Generator, where the rest of our group was staying- a much more happening place.  We also passed the time by drinking a cheap bottle of wine in the street. So let's talk about how much better I like Italy then London.  Expensive much?  The pound is ridiculous.  I would never study abroad here- all in all the trip kind of dissapointed me actually...well okay Saturday was alot better. On Saturday we woke up early and did some sight seeing.  We started at Buckingham Palace and saw a changing of the guards which was an all in all tourist trap...thousands of people there, you couldnt see shit. But Buckingham Palace was cool.  Afterwards, Clay and I went to see Big Ben, the giant clock that towers over the city.  On the way there, we decided to join a war protest.  Well, we more or less just kind of walked into it.  He asked me if I wouldn't mind marching in it.  I was like, what the hell?  I dont like the war- I'm not very into politics but I wouldn't mind showing support.  It was pretty cool and pretty informative for me.  I have never done anything like that before, and it seems like alot of people in London share similar views of our president, and his foreign policy with their prime minister.  Dan was proud of me that I took the iniative to do that, and to learn more about it.  I have a lot of literature that they handed out at the rally that can teach me more about what I was supporting beyond what I already know.  Besides this fact, we walked for nearly 2 hours and it was great excersize.  This exercize was definitely necessary because there is nothing in London to eat- fast food only.  Gross- in the past three days, I have had Mcdonalds twice,Subway once, fish and chips and today Pizza hut before leaving.  I feel fat and disguisting, but these are our only options. I can't wait to get back to Florence and eat the good stuff again, even though its alotta pasta I now realize just how amazingly healthy those meals are!!  Mmmm. Anyways- after this protest we went back to the hostel and got changed. Then we met Kristen, Jen and Clay's friend Brian at the GLOBE THEATER.  I think the trip was worth it just for this part.  The globe theater was amazing, I felt like I was experiencing history there!  It was beautiful, decorated nice, and really cultural.  We were surrounded by all kinda people- a big melting pot.  Then, we hung out till the show started.  The show was ""A Winter's Tale,"" I had never read it in Shakespeare or anything but it was awesome.  If any of you know the story line- it is really confusing as to whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy because it is questionable as to whether someone dies in the end of the story.  But anyways- all in all hilarious Shakespearian play, costumes, accents, amazing dramatic and flawless acting- the whole nine yards. We paid 5 pounds to stand which was uncomfortable but totally worth it and this is the only part of the trip that I felt was really unquestionably worth my time in the end.  After the play we went to Subway then back to Clay's friend Brian's place (he's an actor studying abroad in London for a YEAR), then we hit up the club again in the Generator. I was originally very tired and moody but I ended up nice and tanked by the end of the evening.  Gotta love those Australian and South African men...hahahaha.  And it turns out my buddy Kristin on the trip has a bit in common with me ;)I didnt end up going to bed until about 3am in their hostel and only 3 hours of sleep.  I should sleep like a baby tonight.  Hope so considering the ton of work I have and tests thiw week..ugh. Now we are just kinda bumming around till the flight leaves. I am really excited to get back to Florence, my new home for now.  Well, fall break is in 2 weeks and yes I am going to other Italian cities with my parents. Nothing crazy and exciting like everything else. I would like to but I didnt know people would make those kinda plans when I agreed to have my parents come.  Oh well I will spending less money and I have all my arrangements made and honestly a week away might not be so bad. I really do wish Dan could've come... being a prospective, broke law student sucks for the guy's girlfriend..hahaha oh well I live.

So all in all I had a pretty cool weekend I just reccomend thinking twice before going to London, its alotta money! Hope you all had a fun weekend, miss you lots!

Italy has been amazing thus far. The food is great, the people are pretty friendly (some of them too friendly), the transportation system-not so good, but we deal.... and the people on the trip are awesome. So far I have been all around the center of the city of Florence- the Duomo being the SPOT! Yesterday, Kirsten, Tom, Jen and I went to the Boboli Gardens which were absolutely beautiful. I want to live here someday...just bring everyone I care about over here and hang out. My host family is cool- they speak more English than I anticipated. Only complains- ITS HOT!!, THE BUG BITES, and OMG the freaking busses!- Not like they are any better in the states, I'm just not used to doing it... and in a city where I dont know where anything is... oh well it is getting better. The other night we went out bar hopping- MVP shot and ""Sex on the Duomo.""  Si, es molto buono.  I do miss you all though- and maybe we can try to arrange a time to talk or just send me some MAIL PLEASE!!! ahhh I want mail, very badly. No packages allowed though- just mail. Ummm classes...they seem okay. I'm sure Dr Volkmer's class will be rough because its him but the rest of the classes shouldn't be too bad! Oh well, I think I've written enough for just the first weekend...there will be many more to go bitches <3

Hope all is well in Htown, Ursinus, and at the good old Pmark....

Now into the city we go again!

It was good to see that so many people were there to support you all, and I wish the best for you and your family in this time of need.

Otherwise, I will update again after this busy week ahead and once more before I head off to Italy in just over a week! OMG...wow. And yes, I will be updating while there, no worries :)

"event","Hey everyone,
Not much time...Janine and I are about to go out to dinner in about an hour or so! Let's make this quick and I will include all you need to know.

~Trip to Boston was AMAZING. Sorry I didnt get in touch with anyone in that area while there, or outta touch with people here. There was alot going on, alot I was dealing with and not enough time. Aside from that, had a great time- went to Harvard Square and the Prudential which was a huge mall and the Hancock building which was huge!!! I picked up a Corona shirt and used M20 cd on Newbery St, which is kind of like South Street is to Philadelphia...pretty cool. I also am an EXPERT at taking the subway and know a thing or two about taking trains now- Amtrack was pretty fun, I met some cool people on the train. Sam is a great kid, I love him whole-heartedly. I will miss his ass alot. It was cool to hang in his crib, meet his pops and hang with his friends too. Boston was probably the highlight of my summer.

~This weekened went to Kyle's new pad in Millersville with Kyle, Dan, Kendy and Trav. NICE PLACE! We had fun just chillin and watching movies and went to Denny's on Sunday. I had to leave kinda early because it was like a 2 hour ride home and I had work. Almost got lost on the way there but I attribute that to having terrible vision in the dark ""WHERE WAS THE DAMN GRAVEYARD?!"" 

~My boss is a bad-ass. Enough said! :)

~Remamining things before leaving the states in 15 just TEN DAYS!:
-Wedensday Dan and I are goin to Hershey Park-its gonna be a good time before I get outta here...
-This weekend-End of work and partying it up with co-workers, friends and family thankfully everyone seems to want me to stay! Haha.
-Next week visiting people at UC before I leave...you know who you are! :)
-Finally outta here on Sept 1st.

Ask me for contact info if you didn't get it by email or facebook. If you dont have it by now something is wrong with you...haha just kidding :)

Ciao bitches,

"event","Hey ya'll,
   So my mom and dad are starting to get pissed at my brother and I since we've become little Internet junkes since we got wireless in the house back in April. Honestly, I think they are kinda right so I'm not really gonna be online for the next week. If you need to talk to me, hit up my cell (610-304-1688) or just drop me an email which I will come on to check periodically. So once I leave for Boston early tomorrow morning, I'm gonna try to take a little vacation for that entire week. I've only got a few weeks left before Italy and I guess my time at home should rightfully be spent hanging out with my family instead of on my 'puter trying to figure out how myspace works...hahahaha, I know I'm sad.

Have a good week, everyone :)

"event","So the plan that I drew up in the last entry...I've actually been following it pretty well. After 6 days, I purchased my pack (pretty much due to drinking), and have finished it, and am waiting 12 days to purchase another if I really need it. I haven't had a cigarette in 4 days. I feel fine just a little on edge, I'm sure it'll be like that for everyone. 

Suprise party over the weekend for Kyle was fun and I got to meet lots of people I didn't know. TRAV, I owned you in that contest. And yea Janine and I also saw Wedding Crashers this week which was funny as shit. Last night Dan invited me up for dinner and it was banging then we went to get some frozen yogurt and I passed out at like 9pm. His mom was like umm Chrissy you're not leaving tonight, I felt bad. I dunno why I was so tired. By the way, not like anyone cares but Dan's mom is the SHIT. She is like the coolest person ever and I am so her in 35 years. She chills on her couch every night and drinks yeunglings and smokes basic ultra lights..haha I love it. Also one time we went out to eat and I was talkin about the ghosts that I lived with in Clamer last year and I was like, ""Yea I think one time I slept with one in my bunkbed."" And she goes-""Ooohh..how was he? Any good?"" She doesn't know this but when I am in Italy I am so buying her the first bottle of wine cause she definitely deserves it especially after giving me that blanket she knitted and just being the coolest lady for miles.

The other day I had this freak out about Italy. Honestly, it was nothing and it lasted like .8 seconds. It was basically wahhhh I'm not gonna see my boyfriend for 3 months and I am scared they won't speak English. HAHA. SO my mom heard the conversation I was having and called Dr Hardin, the study abroad coordinator at school. I had no idea, and the lady calls me back yesterday to answer the questions my mom had. It was pretty funny- I was like omg I'm so sorry that my mom is a pain in the ass and bothered you during the summer. Even though I called my mom and yelled at her, it was cool that I got that call because I was able to find out my information about my Italian family (unofficially) a little early. If this all stays the same- I'm going to be living with a single mother and her 16 year old daughter- they also have a dog. Not exactly what I requested but it actually sounds like a good situation. Three chicks living together in an apartment 25 mins from the school. They speak mostly Italian but know A LITTLE English. When they say ""a little"" does that mean like ""Hello, how are you?"" or like ""This is how you get to the school..."" I would prefer the latter, hahaha. I'm sure we'll be learning each other's languages QUICKLY. I don't think I have any roommates though, which is kinda upsetting- at least not any from Ursinus. But I didn't want one from my school, I wanted one from another school. So hopefully I will find that information out eventually. I'm a pretty friendly person so I want to meet students from all over the US and Italy. I also found out that the school has wireless internet so thankfully I will able to talk online as long as I bring my laptop to the school..haha I told Dan he better be ready to wake his ass up at 8 in the morning or stay up till 3 in the morning if he wants to talk to me because of the 6-7 hour time difference, not sure which it is. Other good news- umm, no classes on Friday. My sister is visiting the second week of the trip and my parents are coming during the break when we will be visiting other various parts of Italy (Rome, Venice, Tuscany). YAYY!

In other news- that guy Paul from my work will be giving me Hershey Park tickets as a going away present. So that'll be a good time. Also, I just got my ticket to go to Boston in like 10 days and that should be awesome  :). My sister is turning 30 this weekend and we are all getting drunk and going to the Phillies game. Official weight loss is at 13 pounds and hopefully more to come. I'm really proud of myself I just hope I can find a way to keep it off in Italy.

OH YEAH. One more thing before I go. I just wanted to put this out there. Things that bother me!! (janine, you can agree) Receiving excessive text messages!-First of all, it costs 10 cents for me to receive it, ok? And I am a cheap mother fucker so stop sending them. If you want to talk, call me or IM me. But if you're going to call me, call me during the day or earlier in the evening when I'm gonna pick it up. Everyone should know by now that the job I got this summer requires me to be up usually between 5am and 8am (usually 6 or 7)on weekdays. Therefore, I usually try to go to bed by 11-11:30. When I dont pick up the phone and dont return your call the next day, TAKE A HINT. I am annoyed- stop fucking calling when I'm asleep!! If you're truly my friend or have an interest in talking to me for any other reason that you're drunk and you think im like your booty call or something- you would know this and understand. If you're just trying to get a piece of ass you better give up now before I decide we're not even friends and let the two guys that want to kick the shit outta you come after you...together. Thanks :)

Alright people, talk to you all soon- get your Chrissy time in while you can. If you're a UC kid- make sure you get me your room # so I can visit you all before I go during the first few days of your school year.  PEAAACE.

"event","It has officially been about three years since I began smoking slightly before my senior year of high school. In these three years I have attempted to quit smoking 8 times. So okay the first few attempts were pretty lame and a waste of time, but the last few times were very legitimate- I have tried everything- the gum, going cold turkey, having someone take my cigarettes away from me, smoking ""quest cigarettes"" which contain trace levels of nicotine which can hardly harm your lungs, even taking up other addictions such as gambling. Let's face it- this is a rough addiction, and if you don't smoke I suggest you never start. (I NEVER offer my cigarettes to non-smokers unless they are so incredibly drunk they won't remember it). 

A few good things have happened lately that I hope will help me along the way. One-the smoking cessation readings were helpful. Second, my boss who I usually smoke with at work is trying to quit too- she is on the patch. She hasn't gone out for a smoke in like a week and a half. Third, drinking usually enhances smoking and since I've been dieting I haven't been drinking. Finally, pretty soon I will be living for three months in a country where smoking is prohibited in many public areas. It has been 6 days since my last pack was finished. I know soon that I am going to break. I have been holding out but my body and my mind are telling me I need it. I have devised yet another plan that probably won't work but I'm going to put it out there anyway. 

I figure within the next few days I will buy a pack of ultra light cigarettes (according to hard-core smokers- they are practically AIR). Hypothetically, let's say I bought them tonight- that would be six days since I finished my last pack. Then, when I finish this pack I will wait DOUBLE the amount of days I waited last time to buy a pack- this will be 12 days, then 24 days which is almost a month, and then the number of days will continue to grow. Hopefully, as the days go by my body will become less dependent on the cigarettes so I'll eventually stop buying. Also, when I go to Italy I plan on bringing a box of the nicorette because they now make them in flavors! Earlier in the year when I tried nicorette it only came in non-flavored and it tasted like shit and cardboard- that's why it didn't work. Hopefully this will point me in a good direction. I know my mind doesn't want them but my body does and unless scientists find a cure for cancer in the next 40 years or so- I want to make a goal to at least keep trying.

"event","Hey all~
The past few weeks have been great! But I am realizing that there is just a little over a month left of the summer before I am off to a country that I am not familar with at all! I have had a blast this summer and realized that there are certain things about myself that I just can't change..yes, as much as I hate to admit it-I am a jealous person. I was not happy this weekend when some stupid girl at the democrats convention stole my boyfriend's phone and yelled at me through Becca's phone when she contacted me to make sure everything was cool. Later, I find out that the girl made many attempts at trying to get with him. I also discovered that Dan and Becca spent the night in the girl's hotel room because they were too drunk to return to the dormitory which they stayed in for the trip. This ircked me a little because they all slept in the same bed--Dan sleeping next to the girl. NOW-alotta people who know me well can feel free to say that my problem with him sleeping next to this girl are a little hypocritical. OK, fair enough. However, the people who I have shared beds with in the past year are genuine friends of mine who while we may be/have been fond of each other-I trust them. They don't try to touch me or stick their penis in me while I am sleeping and I feel safe, comfortable, and happy with them. I was a little ticked that he only knew this girl for a few hours before sleeping next to her in a king sized bed in a hotel room along with 2 other people. Meanwhile, I was reassured none of her attempts were reciprocated and everything was okay. Good, jealous Chrissy is somewhat satisfied. However, yesterday I learned that during the convention ""cards"" were exchanged(all the people in the UC democrats have cards with their information-i have no idea the purpose, I know nothing about politics so I dont have one-I assume its to set up meetings and/or talk politics I guess). From the card, the girl got his # and kept calling/texting him. Finally, he returned her phone call and made it clear that he has a girlfriend and is not interested. I know this sounds ridiculous-I would have been with Dan being busy and ignoring me if he was doing something at the convention-but he was ignoring me because some girl was STEALING his cell phone-HOW IMMATURE IS THAT?! I think both Dan and Becca realized that the girl was trouble-and if she persists, I will take action. 

As the end of summer and the semester in Italy approach I realize that while I am 100% ready to go and excited, there is one thing I can't stand to be without and you can probably guess that this is my boyfriend Dan. In the past few weeks we have grown so close and he has finally made it clear that this relationship has potential to be pretty serious. Now that this has happened I'm kinda confused and dont know what to do because I'm so used to being ahead of him when it came to that stuff. I have definitely been lucky to have been dating him for the past 6 months and to have known him well for the past 9 months or so. Second semester was pretty perfect in itself. We were able to hang out on most weekends. It got harder during the weeks that I was working back home at pathmark but I at least managed to stop up and say hello and/or have a couple beers or watch a movie or something. While we were both extremely busy during the week we would spend 2 or 3 nights together in his room so that we could at least be with each other-even if we were asleep. When the summer approached, I was a little nervous because I was used to spending a fair amount of time with him but when I went to meet his family and visit during Easter, I learned that Allentown is but a pretty short distance from Havertown-just under an hour or so. I honestly didnt think I would see him as much as I have. At the beginning of the summer it was almost three weeks before we initially saw each other, and then we began hanging out EVERY weekend after that. And we always do something fun-whether it is going to the beach, Dorney Park, watching the phillies, going to the movies or pool hall or out to dinner, a trip with my or his family, hanging out/drinking/partying with my friends or his, going to the mall, spending a weekend in king of prussia, and lots of other stuff. I have grown accustomed to being with him once a week and being away for three straight months with a lack of communication will be very difficult. I am determine, but as a mature person and knowing myself and him better than most people I can honestly say that we will have to take things one day at a time. Last weekend demonstrated what can happen, and I have certainly been in situations where I have excersized the freedom that he gives me as opposed to my ex-boyfriend. 

Sam is another person who I have grown to love(in a slightly altered sense) in the past few months. At school I would try my very best to make time and hang out with him or spend a night just chillin and talking in his dorm. I think that Sam is a very mature and sincere person-he beautiful inside and out and he exemplifies that type of guy that most girls would KILL for. I know in my heart there is a place for him and there is some kinda love that I have. However, there are obviously limitations and my only hope for him and me in the future(at this point-not to say that this can't change, in life at this age-NOTHING is ever set in stone) is that he will find happiness but still maintain a special place for me in his mind. It really is rough to think about a connection that you had with someone and knowing that the timing was off because you were in a relationship or he was not ready, things of that nature... Occasionally,I ponder how things could be different-and I fight temptations, and I could quite possiblt be kicking myself one day. Regardless, I know I have someone I can count on. Even though he is all the way in Boston I have managed to talk to him almost everyday and call him once every couple weeks. I am so excited to go see him in Boston in a few weeks! All his support and consideration has led me to think that perhaps he may be one of the best friends I've had, and at the same time-someone who I even have a deeper connection with. 

Other than my mom and my good female friends, these are the two guys who have proven themselves to me. Earlier this summer I dealt with a guy who annoyed the hell out of me. He tried to take advantage of me when I was drunk and all of the things he told me at the end of the year and summer were pretty much lies. I shoudldnt even have been talking to him the way I was when I had a boyfriend so yeah Dan I'm sorry about that part. I let him know how I felt about what he did to me the one night and he apologized, came down a little, then starting hitting on one of my best friends!! This totally freaked her out, and made me realize that his intentions were probably just as most guys. I still consider him an acquantince who I am willing to talk to but honestly sometimes he can be annoying. Yet, I am a nice person and will deal with him for a few minutes on the phone every few days. I dont know where that came from but it just proves that some guys are rotten and will do anything just to get a piece of ass. I am glad I have found two genuine people that I can count on and that I love in two different ways. I know they care about me more than just a piece. This is alot of writing and alot of personal thoughts-and honestly it may go friends only if I log back in during the next few days, but I just felt like releasing these thoughts and letting people know who matters to me, who I can count on, and most importantly-who I will miss when I am gone. I wish there were more guys in the world for other girls just like these two.

And as a side note-I will also miss my mom, haha.

"event","And here I am. I had an awesome weekend with my baby first at the amazing Phillies game and fireworks show on Friday then our crazy ass trip to Dorney Park. Hydra the Revenge kicked ass, I want to go back and sit in the front again. Can't forget the crazy tube slides either. All and all possibly the best weekend of the summer. Besides the amazing weekend I do continue worry about where our relationship will go in the future. I think it is really time to start figuring things out, especially with just over a month until Italy. I can't wait for the trip and at the same time I can't wait for it to be over.  I don't know why I worry so much. I promised myself I'd try to take this relationship one day at a time but it is hard when you love someone like I do. You want to know where you are going to be in a year. And at this point that information is not easy to determine.

Like I promised I did go to the dietician and begin my diet. I will probably try to lose about 20-30 pounds before I leave. I dont know if it'll all stay off-if not, it was a good lesson in discipline. So far I have lost 7 pounds and you can somewhat notice a difference. Last night I got really sick- I think my blood sugar was low or something. I started throwing up and today my stomach was very empty and upset. I went to Applebees with Emily and my mom and ate food which helped settle things. The diet is hard but I can do this if I put my mind to it. 

I have been making more of an effort to read my Italy books lately. So far I am almost finished one and if I can read one per week I should most of them finished. Borders is a good place to do reading. I plan to go every weekday- today I wasnt feeling well but Monday I was there for a while- not too loud, not too quiet. And there's coffee :P I've also been reading the paper...yuppp...politically interested. Somewhat. Having a wanna-be politican as a boyfriend does this to you. Social security is a pretty big problem in this country apparently. And the whole attack on London thing was pretty depressing- especially when they announced that the next 2 target areas were Denmark and ITALY. That made my morning--almost. Well, the point is NOT to let the terrorists scare you because that is what they want to do right.

Yesterday I talked to Aseem for the first time in about 2-3 weeks. This is like the same thing as the school year-he says that we're best friends but doesn't even return the phone calls. Sometimes I wonder if he's pushing himself too hard in school. Meanwhile when it comes to friends I have been talking to Matt the most. Hopefully somewhere between work and Italy and visiting Sam in Boston I can also get up to Berwick to visit his ass too. I miss Matt alot we grown pretty close this summer in being apart.

Oh well I'm off to sleep in a few--hoping to feel better tomorrow! :)

"event","So it is officially more than half way through the summer and so far I have done alot of fun stuff but I still must get alot of things done that I promised myself I would do. Last night's Dave Matthews concert (which was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING) was a good note to go out on. I had a lot of fun drinking for hours in the parking lot, meeting some really awesome new people, and watching one of the most amazing Dave shows I have seen in years. Even his new songs from ""Stand Up"" were incredible and closing with Two Step was even more amazing.

I also have been drinking alot of beer and eating alot of food lately. Why would I do this to myself? Well today I am finally going to a professional dietician. No more messing around. For the next 2 days I have to fast and then after that its some special diet- I have no idea how this will work in Italy considering I must eat everything they put in front of me but hopefully all the walking and stuff will even things out. Hopefully it'll work and I can't wait to lose 20-30 pounds, YAY!

Speaking of Italy, yeah so I really do need to start reading the books for the trip. This is starting to get ridiculous. Since being at home has proven distracting with 3 other people living here, tvs, computers, etc- I am going to venture to my public library to do this probably every day or every other day. Yes, I'm a dork but I also want to get this shit done so I don't have to worry about it later. Or at least get some of it done, I think its impossible to finish it ALL at this point. Let's just be hopeful and optomistic...

Work has been interesting. Last week was a very tough week for my department. Our boss went on vacation and the boss that came in refused to learn where everything was located in our store. Honestly she was lazy and kind of stuck up. I had a hard time impressing her with what I knew which isnt much compared to other people, and we had a hard time getting everything done. So yeah we definitely heard about it later. I didn't take it personally because I am only one person and it wasn't all my fault. This week we have caught up on everything and I have even learned more things. I am kinda sad to leave there in about a month and a half...it might be the last time. And this time I am actually going to miss it because I really like working in PIC.

I have been doing alot better with smoking unless I am drinking or having a hard time at work. Last night was no good cause I was drinking all day. 

Let's see, what else is going on in the near future worth mentioning? This weekend Dan and I are going to the Phillies fireworks game, and to Dorney Park on Saturday if the rain does hold out. Next weekend we are going back down to the shore to the house we went in on with Mikey P and friends from his firehouse. Let's make sure we have everything on our checklist right jack? Haha. That should be awesome! I really am liking how this summer turned out. In the beginning I was like depressed cause I was so bored but now it has definitely been worth it. In August I am also going to Boston and New York. PEACE OUT!

I'm gonna lose like 20-30 pounds and when its done I'm gonna look soooo hot! :P (Not that I'm not hot now, but you know how it is hehehe) I'm also really going to try to quit smoking this time. My lip is all fucking chapped up and it hurts to smoke a cigarette right now anyways. Yea, I'm really trying this time or I think Aseem and my mom will eat me alive. So kids-whats it gonna be this time (my 8th attempt)-the patch, the gum, hypnosis?? Hahahaha this is like a game anymore.

I have been partying hard this week and eating whatever I want because I know come Sunday I promised myself I'll be good. For those of you going to Live 8 be careful I heard some crap about a possible terrorist attack(it probably wont happen but just be safe if it does). That's just another reason I won't go!...

"event","I am back from the beach and it was such an amazing weekend. I have so much color and a new beautiful shell necklace which I love so much. It was amazing to just lie down and relax and even get a little reading done. 

Love is a hard thing and lately it is more and more apparent to me that the person I am in love with doesn't love me. Everyday that passes brings a slight pain that I just can't escape. It has been like this since the beginning. A few driving forces have presented themselves in order to make me change my mind. The confusion I have experience within the the past few weeks has been outrageous. I am dealing with 2 completely different sides- I could lead 2 different and equally amazing life. Something keeps telling me i shouldnt give up though. I fought so fucking hard for my baby, just to call him mine. And when he looks at me on a quiet night and says that he WANTS to love me, that's the shit that makes me want to hold on. 

I think I will know on September 1st if this is more than a casual college fling...meanwhile I continue to reflect on the mistake I could be making in not letting go.  Heres to love, and ever wondering what it feels like in return...

Back to work tomorrow but i have a competition check to do so superfreshers and gianters and acme kids watch out I'm coming for you around noon tomorow!!:P

So I deleted my most recent entry in here. I decided I was being immature. Perhaps I misjudged or had my information incorrect about what had happened with that guy. I mean, he's still not my favorite person in the world but now that I have to work with him again I decided I can just be nice and act like nothing ever happened. And honestly, I am adult enough to do that. So ITS DONE. End of story!

Anyways, the weekend with my baby was wayyyy too short. KOP Friday into Saturday was fucking amazing, I love you hun. The only thing that sucked was that we were sooooo tired because we walked around the mall for like 5-6 hours on Saturday. Dan is quite the picky shopper hahahaha. I definitely can't wait till the beach next weekend...its gonna be sooo kick ass!:P I pickd up a book yesterday I wanna read and some new clothes...I def have to start tyring to read at least some of my books for Italy damn.

Last night with my neighbor Jess's gradauation party which was totally kick ass-I was shockingly great and beer pong, YAY. Afterwards, we went to Emily's random bday party. Mark Mitchell, a  kid in knew in high school for competitive marching band was there and he told us the craziest story that we didn't really think was a story! I don't really feel like writing too much else...Just looking forward to getting through a busy week of work and off to the beach for the weekend...whoooo!

Happy Birthday Emily <3

So I wrote this entire entry yesterday and completely erased it. I swear sometimes I just dont have any sense. Oh and I tried that Catch27 thing, I didn't really understand how it works but I still wiretap people so I guess thats all good. Let's see, I have been fucking busy lately!

So yeah working has become more and more important and my lifestyle this summer has kinda changed for the better I guess. I am working more, drinking less and all that fun stuff. I have mixed feelings about not being able to go out as much but its all good. USually, I have work like 4-5 days a week, at least 3-4 of them being in PIC. When I work in PIC I usually go in at 7 or 8 in the morning unless it is a Thursday night price tag fiasco which is absolutely crazy in itself! This week I was trained to do some new stuff with the computer and other fun stuff other than just hanging price tags and next Tuesday I get to have lots of fun running the department basically on my own. I kinda wish I had done this job alot earlier because it would have made my experience at that store just 100% better.  I apologize that all I talk about is my job nowdays but I am there like everyday and its pretty much consumed me.

I can't really go out too many nights anymore, at least not too late. If you're looking to get some quality time in or try and party with me Wedensdays are always a really good night because I won't work till at least 4pm on Thursdays, I promise! So remember that-especially people who haven't seen me in a while.

I am trying to find a good time to get my ass up to Boston and hang out with my boy Sam (haha, I wrote your name in here arent you embarrased?!) And come on its BALLLLSTON! So yea hopefully at the end of the summer between Florence and the NY choir trip I can find a day or 2 to go enjoy the city. If not, it looks like you're biking the trip down here...j/k :P

Sooooo I hung out with Aseem the other night and he is doing splendid, working hard as usual. Not much else going on. I worked for my dad for a while today and I hung out with Kate last night we went to the movies to see Mr n Mrs Smith which was really good~""Ask us the sex question again?"" hahahaha. This weekend I am doing a bunch of stuff with Dan and we are going to my neighbors graduation party which will be lots of beer pong so yay! Call me up! :P

Sorry for the lack of updates. I have been mad busy and the only reason I am online now is to help some dear friends of mine with some troubles!~

Brief update of the last couple weeks!
~Started Italian class with my mom at Delco. I am the youngest person in the class and as tradition (according to our signorina) I have been showing my mom up so far. Since its no credit/grade its a bit hard to keep focus and actually do work but I will try my best. After all, I have to get prepared for ITALY BABY!

~2 weeks ago I went up to Dan's house for the Mayfair and we went hiking at Hawk Mtn. Eddy money was fucking hilarious ""Be my little baby..baby my darling."" ""I GOT TWO TICKETS BUT IM TAKING EVERYBODY!""~drunk eddy money. The hike kicked ass-together we hiked almost 6miles over the rocky river and saw lots of turkey vultures, fish, a frog, a garden snake (we think) and had a close encounter with a rattle snake and a bluebird. If you want to see pics, let me know!!:P This past weekend we partied with the crew and went to the New Jersey State Aquarium which was fun although I felt like I was 10. I got to pet a shark and a sting ray where a little girl almost fell into the tank. I also saw lots of different fish, a sloth and some birds and penguins and seals! After the aquarium we went to South Street where I also took my sorority sister Claire on Sunday to corrupt in three naughty sex shops..hahaha good times were had by all.

~I completely redid my room at the end of last week. My mom and I (with no help from my brother because hes lazy and my dad because hes been sick) tore up my old shitty carpet and polished the hardwood floors, removed many of the tacks and staples and replaced the carpet with an area rug which covers about 80% of the room- most of the remainder being covered by the *NEW FURNITURE* (According to Dan the floor needs more work but kiss my ass baby we worked hard:P) The resulting product is a pretty new hot room which is alot more chill to hang out in. I wish I had a digital camera to take pics with but I don't so if you want to see it come stop by sometime! ITS HOT!

~Today I started working in the pic department at work (changing the prices of the items). My boss Marie is a funny sarcastic lady who really likes to make fun of Eric the cartboy while I think he has a ridiculous crush on her (i know right?) Anyways~the time goes soooo much faster because you are on your feet and you're not like standing in one place at a time. I was soo focused too!(thanks DRock:P) Hopefully I will be working there 2-3 days a week and then more time on cashier or something. Thank goodness I liked it cause I was so bored there I was ready to be out like a shout. 

Alright I think I'm gonna go find a way to avoid the crazy heat outside. (I know I wanted warm weather but this is insane!!!) Be good ya'll!

And to you, you know who you are...hang in there and remember I love you and I hope one day everything is okay for you..<3

"event","Hey~
The weather has been so shitty the past couple days I can't stand it anymore! These days have been the best though, I'm not gonna lie. Saturday I went up to Dan's in Allentown which was definitely great-I really missed my Dan and it was great to see him and catch up. We got to play golf and go to WALMART (I love that store but he doesn't). Sunday I had work 2-6(I KNOW-DAY HOURS!!) Then Dan came back and we all had a little party at my house. Party for me consisting of a power hour and everyone else having various (mostly political) debates. I'm interested in learning enough but I feel like there's way too much to learn and I'll never be truly informed. Oh well new goal of the summer is to read the newspaper for a bit each day and learn some new things about the world!

Monday was our barbeque and Dan is quite the griller..not gonna lie he's awesome! We had cheeseburgers, ribs, lots of snacks (well, I did, bad me!!), salad, cherry 7up and ice cream sandwhiches. We definitely need to have a barbeque more often as soon as the weather gets better-I hate this cold, rainy shit it makes me depressed.

Yesterday I went for my first big girls' doctor's appointment. Ladies, it's honestly not that bad. You were all right!

I think tonight and tomorrow I am babysitting my beautiful niece and going to try and play some ball tomorrow with Sarah my old band buddy and possibly Jason later in the week since I got conned out of playing him last night and go coaxed into doing a power hour. Those damn power hours fuck me up too bad i am considering no more for a while! :) Alright off to the gym and another crappy day outside..blah. I wish it would just be summer like jackie said where we can run around with skirts and tanktops and it not be cold at all. COME ON SUMMER!

To end this I'm gonna ask you all one question- If you woke up in bed with me, what would  your first thought be? (Thanks for the idea Kate). Post this in your lj and I'll respond..<3

I've basically been at UC the past 2 days participating in graduation activities. All I can say is *tear!*  The seniors this year were such a big part of my life I honestly don't know what it is going to be like without them for the next two years. The ceremony was pretty nice-a little boring in the beginning but went a lot quicker than it did back in high school. I got some nice pictures of Tia, Chantell, Camila and Salber when they came back up the aisle. My pictures of Joe and Nikki weren't as good because I didn't catch them coming up the aisle, which pissed me off but I'll live.  It was wierd-I thought this entire year that Joe's g/f Agnes had hated me. I mean, the way he described things it seemed like she felt threatened by me or something. Then all of a sudden Friday she started talking to me when I was helping Aseem move out. And yesterday we went to the ceremony and sat together. It was pleasantly suprising. I think I may it clear that I am no competition for ANY of the guys in the suite's girlfriends anymore (apparently John's girlfriend didn't like me either, and I'm sure you all are aware of other situations). I don't know when I'll see any of them again but I figure it was a good note to go off on.

After the ceremony I took some things to Becca and Becky's new apartment which was nice but their room was awfully small, so good luck with that. The people living there were really nice and Malcom's one friend Mike looked kind of like Kozusko..haha. Speaking of which, on the last day of class Kozusko emailed me telling me I had ""left papers"" in the exam room that he wanted me to come pick up in his office. HONESTLY, I checked to make sure I took everything out of the room that day. I have no idea what I could have possibly left and I think the whole thing is kinda *shady* if you ask me. I really wonder what he actually wants. My grades all got posted except for one but I'm pretty sure that altogether I will have 2 B's in Satire and Advanced Writing, a B+ in Brit Lit (HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?!) and an A- in Education. At least its better than I thought but things still need to improve.

One of the guys I went to Spain with in the choir has been talking to me alot. He did graduate yesterday but is a really nice guy to talk to. Certain things that happened on the trip led me to believe that he was only talking to me for one reason and I am sure you can guess what that might be. I also wasn't sure why he contacted me a few weeks before graduation just to chat. I am still not entirely sure, as I do have trouble trusting people-but he seems like he genuinely likes me and is a nice person. I always thought he was interesting, before I even really knew him. He lives in Philly so next time I am in the city I'm gonna hit him up. 

Past couple days at home have been fun- seen all my girls at some point or another and pretty much caught up on stuff. It should be an interesting summer. You all know I'll go out virtually anytime but I really do have to cut back on the drinking and eventually try to quit smoking. The drinking only because I gained a lot of weight over the year from drinking and eating bad food and the smoking because if I keep smoking Aseem will fucking kill me and I'm serious.

Final order of business-would anyone in Uphi (or previously in it) be interested in having a summer *social* event? One of the alumni offered to have it at her house in Conshohaken and it sounds like it could be fun.  Let me know, no rush on this we have mad time.

Alright I do have to go to the gym since I blew it off yesterday..see ya! <3


6 days baby..<3

"event","In continuing with my retarded tradition I always like to thank people at the end of the year who have helped me get by. Later, I will reflect on the year as a whole. I figured I'd post the people first so before they leave for home they might have a chance to read.  This year I feel as if there are way too many damn individuals so I am going to try and post in groups when I can.

The ladies of Upsilon Phi Delta:  Talk about a representation of diversity?  I think we have all shown it through just being ourselves.  I can't think of a better 14 individuals who truly represent diversity. To those random cows out there just remember next year we're not gups anymore and it's gonna be ruckus. And to the seniors-Tia, Tish, Chantell and Maedea since I won't see you next year- I love you all and you will definitely be missed.  Thanks for the cool stuff! :)

Forensics Team:  While its been tough for me to always come out I think we had an interesting season to say the least and I look forward to some advancements when I return from Italy. I'll never forget celebrating my 20th birthday in a gay bar.

Loft-room chillers:  Wish I had more time to come chill this semester, sorry for that. We'll make up for it next year. And to the ladies-you're all sexy!

Those of you who went to Spain esp Diana, Kaitlyn and my plane buddy you know who you are- Good times, sangria tops them all!

Those of you who live in 306 Reimert and frequent people who hang out:  Its been real, except when I have too much to drink and start unnecessary drama. But we have seen the end of those days last semester. Glad it's been real. To those of you leaving the suit, well you just suck... j/k. 

School->
~Nikki: You are everything a man wants in a women. You are funny and smart and you are one of the sexiest girls I have ever seen. (I am serious). Please please please don't forget me and come visit in the spring when I am back from Italy. I heart you babe.

~Heather:  While on the topic of sexy girls.. I missed you this semester, not enough hanging out. We'll make up for it. Our spooning session was fun and our trip to the movies for satire was also quite interesting. Grab a beer w/ me before school ends-you deserve it.

~Becca:  A tip for this summer, next year and the years to come. If you think you've lost something, turn around, re-trace your steps. DON'T PANIC. It is bound to be somewhere where you wouldn't think to look because its too obvious. I will probably see you at Chris Santine's party and various other events this summer. Oh and your mom is hot :P.

~Kevin: Kev- Chrissy time was not there this semester. This deeply saddened me. I swear you better hang out with me before school ends or I may be angry. Good luck with summer fellow and keep me posted on your relationship and your doggy. I'll miss being your dedicated hallmate.

~Sam:  Its easy to have a connection with someone but its hard to maintain a connection through thick and thin that can be tested and re-tested and anything you can think of. Your face tends to light up rooms for me and well there's always gonna be a special place for you. Sorry I was a bitch sometimes. Find what you want to do and do it. Don't let me or anything else stop you..<3

~Eric:  Undoubtedly, you became my best friend this semester. Through all the drama you were there to make it stop or at least pause for a while.  I think that there has been times where I've seen a hero in you. Thanks for the favors with PP and projects, all the random times where it was just rough and especially with Brit Lit. I owe my grade to your willingness to help me. I love ya kid.

~Sean, Matt, Xander: Well, what is symbolism anyway? Are we talking about the same symbolism that is taught in literature classes. No I thought not. I knew you guys last year and I am sorry I didn't get as much time to spend with you all this year. I feel awful about it especially since Xander you are transferring (you ass) but I did try as hard as I could and I feel like this year another trip or 2 to Berwick is in order-See this computer? Yeah its symbolism..integral..coconut pecan pie. Yo xander and matty remember Ramadan?  EVERYDAY. Oh and Xander, best of luck in Pitt I will very much miss you.

~Joe aka Jdiddy (find me while i'm here): OK so the meanness helps sometimes. And sadly, I'm gonna miss it. I'm gonna miss being made fun of. You are probably one of the people I will miss most out of this year's graduating class. I know you dont' wanna visit but at least come once in the spring for me please. Your graduation party better go down. OH and I'll see you this summer with PP and thanks for being my VP, you were an awesome help. I hope one day your girlfriend stops being jealous of me or whatever, so we can really have a more intense friendship. JDIDDY RUNS THE TABLE!..<3

~Aseem: Oh Sexy. I don't want to write a novel. Think of the tallest and scariest roller coaster you've been on. That's kinda like our friendship. Rough and sickening at certain points, climaxing in the middle and ultimate ending in satisfaction. Wow that sounded sexual, sorry. Above all I do admire your persistence in becoming a doctor. I hope things work out for you. Let's try to work at becoming best friends again. Hopefully making cuts at the end of this year will help us, since it didnt get done last year. See you up at the Dub C. I love you.

Last but not least Danimal my sexy tyranasauras (RAAARRR!):  Well, this will not be the only way I say thanks (Sorry I am a cheesy poet and must make my point in a gazillion other ways). Anyways, thanks for giving me the chance to prove my love in its entirety and the chance to truly familiarize myself with you. These past 4 months have been busy but having you around has made them exciting and passionate at times. I know we have such a long way to go but my heart is already overwhelmingly taken with you. Thanks for the print outs, the rides, picking up my roommate when I had work, dropping things off for me, taking me out, you are truly amazing. I look foward to spending as much time with you as possible these last days of school, and in summer. My trip to Italy will be well worth it but it will be hard without having your warmth beside me at night and your humor with me through the day. Don't let anyone get you down, you are more special than you think. ~The best things come to those who wait for them~ I waited and man do I have the best. I love you with all my heart, Dan. Good things to come baby, good things.

Work->
Sher: Way to leave, way to fucking leave. The memories are always here. If you still want to go to Buffett you should get in touch. Me you and Bill could make it a night again! :)

Kath-Dawg: Kinda like my mom at work. Don't forget me being a nag. You finally gave in tonight, and I am hung over still. Soooo kath how many people are on till midnight tonight? Haha and yo I promise I won't frisck you for the manager's card. I'm sure you've been called a MILF enough.

Christopher:  Go ahead, go be an accountant. See if I care. Thanks for the random smokes and the funny talks and I always love hearing about your sex life so don't be ashamed to tell.

Bill: I'm glad you appreciate my sparkles!  Ya know, you're not so bad yourself ;).  See you sometime in the DUB C I am sure.

Allan:  Well, well well. Whose been the coolest friend at work ever? ALLAN! ""Hey chrissy wanna eat my nuts?"" Thanks for the michael jackson link. I'm so there for your prom I wanna see you and your hot girlfriend look all cute and stuff. I wanna make this summer fun so we'll have to chill alot in and out of work before I go to Italy. I heart you babe.

The rest of you I will see this summer and we will make more memories to fit in an lj entry.

And so it goes..<3

"event","I'm at home right now until tomorrow morning. Its been nice. I have done most of my Advanced Writing paper and still have an Intro for my Brit Lit paper. I have done all my other HW for tomorrow and am going out tonight to hustle Gibson at the pool hall. I went out to the mall today with my mom and Janine and bought 2 outfits for the formals and I may only wear one. I worked last night and this morning which was cool especially cause I had lots of hours with Allan he's my boy.

Now, I am going to go on with something I feel rather fearful about and I am asking for advice or opinions. I fell in love at the beginning of this year and I have truly enjoyed the company of the person I love. As time has gone on, my love has grown and been consumated by all that we have done, and all that we have become. I fought long and hard to have a real chance--and no kidding I feel like I have it. BUT, there's a catch. He doesn't love me yet. I know I can't force him, I can't make him fall in love with me and I can't make up his mind about how serious our relationship is or where it's going. But I just am scared of what is going to happen when I leave the country and he is still behind. I fear that she's still on his mind, after all this time..I mean the only reason he is with me anyways is because she finally gave him the boot. I love him, I'll never give up on him and that's a promise but I get scared and I think sometimes he's going to turn around and say to me, ""Chrissy this was a mistake, I'm not over her."" It is my biggest fear right now and I know that it is definitely a possibility. I am more in love than I have ever been in my life before and I am scared that it is all going to fall apart in front of my face because of either my persistence or his inability to move on from that phase of his life. Maybe some people had a point when they advised me not to turn back to him and I knew they had a point. I just live him-All i can do when I am with him is tell him how much I love him, and I think it starts to piss him off. Its cause I can't think of anything else to say because the few opportunities I have to see him are times where all I want is to be loved. I heard out there a couple times that the greatest happiness you'll ever know is to love and be loved in return. When that happens to me, I'll never want anything else again...

This past week was cool because I only had to work on Sunday and Wedensday. I don't understand why my boss KEEPS scheduling me every Monday when I have told her REPEATEDLY I need Monday's off. If I hadn't r/o a bunch of days this week I'd be calling out tomorow too. Doesn't she get it?  Work has been okay, I just am getting sick of the drive and I am realizing that while I love the job and having it this whole time and not having to reapply was helpful, the drive and amount of extra time it all eats out of my week is fucking me over big time. I know my grades have slipped this semester and in future semesters things are going to be different. No more of this letting work take over school work thing. I guess after this summer I'm pretty much done there anyways. Think of it this way- how much extra time did I put in after high school? Three years is enough kids.

Thursday I went to a party with the Men's rugby team and Tau sigma gamma who are actually a pretty great group of girls. High five to Nikki, well you know why Nikki. The party was awesome and I have to give Tau Sigma mad props for their musical selections at the party, I had a good time there and liked the music alot. Somehow I ended up muddy and in Sprankle (I think thats the name of the dorm) at about 2am and it was fucking wet and dirty in there. I don't even remember how or why we were there...and I don't think Dan, Jason or anyone else could've told you either.

This weekend was sweet because I was off and alot of stuff went down on campus that I was a part of. It sucked that both Dan and Eric had to peace out on me the one weekend I had all off but oh well. Friday night was Airband and a couple of us from Uphi did a dance to ""Dip It Low"" and had another dance part PLANNED to ""Brush that Dirt off your Shoulder""(I am still pissed they CUT OUR SONG OFF!) But the part that we were able to perform was good. I think we shocked the hell out of some people-they all thought uphi were a bunch of quiet little dorky community service girls. I was a little pissed we got stuck going behind the one frat who had a reallllly funny performance and ended up winning the whole thing. Haha they were awesome but not awesome to go after. Also kudos to KDK for winning three awards, way to go girls.  A lot of work went to Airband and it was for a good cause and I had a lot of fun with that and hopefully we can keep it up next year and make this a yearly thing. After the Airband, I hung out in the Loftroom with Diana, Sleepy, Kaitlyn, Rachel, Bryan, Jordan and some other people. Soon thereafter, a few of us went over to the party at Shreiner because a lot of uphi people were there but the cops showed up. I am still not sure if that had anything to do with the size of the party or if it was something else shady that was going on. Regardless, we left. 

Saturday I spent most of the day working on my next Advanced Writing paper-I decided to write a review on a CD of Howie Day's which I've been having some trouble on. I think it needs to be 4 pages and I can only get about 3 outta it. I really don't know what else to say-well, Ive never had this problem before. This must be a problem for Joe to tackle when he gets his ass up today. Afterwards I hung out with Matt and Sam for a little then we went to dinner. Xander kept putting ice cubes down my shirt and they were really cold and it pissed me off. After dinner my mom came up for my concert for college choir of Creation. There was hardly anyone there because the Collective Soul concert was the same night. This pissed me off because I definitely wanted to go to that and help out with it because I am actually in CAB but its been a while since I had time to do anything with it. Fucking Ursinus-way to plan your weekend!

After our concert, I went to Harant's apartment over in the Dub C. It had been a while since I was able to hang out with him and his apartment buddies. I missed the fantabulous Haranty, silly Kyle and drunk Foulds with his girl that no one liked. I felt bad because I passed out a little early again- I have a bad tendancy to do that. But then again, I was tired and stoned. It is always great to chill with Harant- he takes my mind off the serious shit I have to deal with and takes me to a place I don't get to go much. Rock on..

Aseem and I have been talking and chilling more. Maybe he just didn't have much this weekend or whatever but I hope it keeps up. Let's hope our schedules work out again.

So today I am attempting to finish up this paper and head to work pretty soon, I work today and Monday of this week and then am here till Saturday so hopefully we'll have a good week. 

*funny happenings this weekend*
post-concert:
me: but yeah we'll definitely have to try and party sometime before you graduate.
salber: hopefully, we'll see...i have papers upon papers to do..
me:  but i thought we were plane buddies!..hahaha

telephone call:
harant (picking up his phone): hey 
me:  yo
harant:  what's the good word chrissy?
me: ummmmmm....PENIS?

I think the last one I wrote may have been last semester or early this semester, so I've just been missing time. I'm going to write one today and try to keep them in check from now on.

Today's dedication entry goes to my good friend Eric. I've been starting to realize (scary enough) that my life is becoming heavily dependent on Eric (not in a sick, obsessive way) but in the way that he helps me through. I don't think I'd be passing Brit Lit or keeping my grades up without his help. And he has this way of keeping me calm about my busy life that alot of people don't have. My favorite thing about Eric is that I think we have a similar of thinking although I can write a paper alot quicker than him :)

"event","All I want is 5 minutes to sit down, and collect my thoughts. I guess this is what I am doing now, so I hope you enjoy sharing this time with me.

Ever since I returned from Spain I was having problems with my two closest guy friends on campus-Aseem and Sam, another freshman who I met this year-we have a great connection. I guess the insecurity about whether or not I would remain friends with them just held me back for the past week and a half. But I guess I've realized that everything is going to be alright. I know sometimes you shouldn't take friendships for granted. But sometimes your best friend can't be next to you holding your hand at every moment during the day. However, if you called on them you'd know they'd be there in a second if needed.

As I mentioned in the last entry, the past 2 weeks have been full of my amazingly complicated research paper for Advanced Expository Writing. I thought the legalization of gambling in PA issue was cool in senior year-now its fucking complicated. As of earlier today, my paper has been completely altered and will be evaluated by my professor tomorow. Let's hope she likes it better than Dan's daddy whose the expert on it. Hopefully she will.

This weekend I was literally everywhere. Friday after classes the forensics team met with Lynne Edwards, who is a journalism/communications professor, I think. She is our team's advisor and is helping us find a new coach for next year which I sincerely believe we will need. I hope the team can make some serious advances and will show me up when I get back from Florence. After the meeting, I had to head home for work 6:30-10:30. After work, Dan drove down and we met the group and we went out to the Squire for food. Janine, Jackie, Emily, Kate, Derreck and Tommy were all there. It was especially nice to see Kate because I hadn't seen her in a while. After we ate, we went back to my house and played King's Cup. Since I was so tired I ended up pretty tipsy by the end of the game. 

The next morning we got up at 7:30 and went back to school. I had airband rehearsal from 9-11, then a bunch of girls from Uphi went to breakfast. Afterwards, I smoked with Diana and Joe and then Diana and I went to watch Dan play rugby which was an enlightening but nerve-wracking experience. The one kid on our team came off the field with a huge bleeding cut on his leg. He poured some water on it and got right back on the field tackling people in the mud. He saw me looking at him and was like ""Yeah, pretty isnt it?"" I was like, ""Isn't that a bit unsanitary"" and he responded, ""That's how we always deal with it."" My 5th grade self would have kicked my ass for that comment. Later on, another one of the guys told everyone in the stands to take off their clothes off. Diana and I looked at him and I was like, ""you first!"" Then he started to take off his pants. Needless to say, all those guys seem very interesting-i'm looking forward to their formal in May. 

After the game Dan and I went back to his place and visited *Travis* at work (BTW, congrats Travis!) We went out to dinner then to the movies to see ""Hostage"" with my 2nd cousin's ex-bf Bruce Willis which was good but a bit too violent for me (Again, my 5th grade self is kicking my current self's ass for this!) After the movies we went to *WALMART*(I love going there b/c theres not one near me and they are fun). I came back to my house this morning at about 10:00 and have been with my family for Easter ever since. I got to see my favorite cousin Evan and my niece and sister but unfortunately I have been working diligently on my freaking paper the entire time which sucks. So I guess this weekend I really was all over the place and needless to say it's time for some rest and relaxation!

I found out I am definitely going to Florence next semester. I know I was planning on it all year but I am definitely going now. I picked out my classes for next semester in Florence which will be- Italian Literature, 300 level and Travel Writing, both with Dr. V-should be a challenge. I also have Italian 101 and Bio 100 which should be cool especially to have in Italy.

The only crappy thing about this weekend was the situations I was put in. I always felt like I was somewhere where I was out of the loop, and it doesn't mean I'm mad at anyone-I just am so busy I can't connect with any one group of people. First on Friday, Janine, Jackie and Emily have been hanging out all semester at home and i have no idea what they were talking about half the time. Hopefully I will learn more next weekend; Saturday I was so confused at the rugby game and then today I was totally out of the loop because I didn't go to Syracuse with my family for the Villanova basketball tournaments. It was not necessarily a bad feeling I just realize maybe I've either been self-centered or just really busy and have missed out on alot of non-Ursinus related issues. So better luck with that, at least until I go to Italy, then all contact will be limited to emails to everyone..

I suppose that's enough for now, if you are still reading. I'm just talking cause I can. Happy Easter everyone, remember the reason for the day..God Bless.

YES I CAN HAVE MY ROOTBEER NOW! :)

"event","These past few days have been a mix of heaven and hell. (Thanks for that one, Matt.) Anyways, Dan and I have had lots of privacy with neither of our roommates being around which is always fun. However, I have had to work almost every night and have hardly got to see him other than for an hour before I'm ready to go to sleep which is shitty because I then proceed to fall asleep. I have had a lot of work getting this paper started for advanced writing class-its definitely a process. I decided to write a paper on something similar to what I did for my senior project back in high school and that was the legalization of gambling in pennsylvania. However, as alot of you might know, there has been a whole lot more to do with that since that time. In fact, 61,000 casinos have been established in our state as of July 4th 2004. If Act 72 can be approved upon, more casinos will be established, I think. Act 72 is really really difficult to understand and Dan's dad has been trying to explain this to me but I am mildly retarded yet interesting. While the act claims to decrease the amount of property taxes people in a gambling area will have to pay, it raises income tax by a small margin, but if Act 72 is agreed upon that margin can be increased. Apparently if the income tax is taken away this will give schools less money to spend on programs and services, which sucks. So its either education or property taxes? OK i think I just wrote that whole paragraph so i would better understand my paper topic. Wow, i'm so pathetic.

I am getting to the point where I am starting to realize that everyone around me has changed. Its not necessarily a bad thing but its driven them apart from me and that sucks. Firstly, alot of my friends this year are seniors-this is awfully sad. I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna do next year without them. The fact that I will only see a lot of these people for 5 more weeks of my life is really scary. I honestly hope all of them will come back and visit-except for the ones going t o the peace core, who had better at least write me, cause I'm gonna be realllly sad about that! :(  

I'm going to an Ursinus party tonight- I can't tell you when the last time I did that was. I have been so busy its ridiculous, hopefully it'll be a promising time. I hope my new buddy JD shows up-he's such an awesome guy and I'm real glad he just lives downstairs! 

Next, I know I said I'd accept it last entry but I'm starting to be hurt. A best friend wouldn't walk away from you on the way out of a class when you repeatedly call his name and ask him if he wants to go to lunch with you. A best friend wouldn't completely ignore your presence when you walk into his place of residency.  A best friend would sit down next to you in a room full of people without question. And finally no matter how ""sick of"" you he was, a best friend would answer your phone call in a time of need. I understand you are busy and I understand that you have a girlfriend who I also love dearly, but don't go telling someone she's the best friend you ever had when you completely ignore her presence. I'm done complaining, I'm done nagging and annoying you about it. I am hurt and until you find me, I am done seeking you out.

Next weekend is Easter-it came so fast, and is it just me or did it seem so incredibly close to St. Patty's Day?  I'll definitely be home for the weekend shooting a bit and hopefully chillin with the friends I didn't get a chance to see for the short time I was home before Spain (coughjanineandkatecough). Until then, I hope you all have a fantastic week and be good! <3

"event","Wow. Spring Break was definitely a rocking time in Spain. I went with the Meistersingers from school and had a really awesome time. Toledo and Barcelona were 2 of the most amazingly beautiful cities that I have ever seen. For my first time overseas this was definitely amazing. I saw alot of modern art from artists such as Gaudi, Picasso and my personal favorite of the group Salvador Dali, who is apparently opening an exhibit in Philly. Though it got a bit redundant towards the end, I gained a certain appreciation for each artists' work and learned to silently appreciate art in that way. I also shopped a bit, visited a few spanish bars, made spanish tapas and drank LOTS of sangria. I also made 2 very new good friends-hey to kaitlyn and diana, mis novias! 508/303 connection holler. Oh and I think the best part of the trip was the trip to the spanish club and the Latino dancing that I couldn't do as well as the rest of you. And of course, our tour guide-what an awesome guy!

I don't really have time to write out like every detail about the trip which I usually do, so heres a rundown of some funny quotes that summarize how the trip played out:

""Senor Pappy's pooping""-Pat (literally everytime someone came into their room)

""Mi novia...""-Diana and Kaitlyn fighting over me as their fake girlfriend

""I'm sorry, I just don't do well with vibrating objects..""-Me(long story)

""Tiene novio?""  ""Si.""  ""Donde esta tu novio?""  ""Mi novio esta en Nuevo York.""  ""Ah, y mi mujer esta en India.""--Conversation between Diana and 40 year old bar tender

""Are you a veternarian, cause these triceratops are sick!""-Pat to Salber

Basically the entire Spanish horses joke which ended with Pappy saying-""I farted.""

""CHUG, CHUG, CHUG!""-Everyone to Tamar as she chugged 2 glasses of pipping hot churro chocolate

""I don't care what it is, we're drinking it!""-JD as he chugs a glass of champagne without realizing its horrendous cost

""I'm not gonna be baracho for quite a while""-Pat (drunk in Spanish)

""Are you getting sick of me?""-ME (dead silence)  ""Come on, I know you have got to be getting sick of me by now.""  ""FINE, I am sick of you!""-Aseem

""Estoy un poco baracho, y tu?""-Bathroom cleaning lady at the night club

""I'm a cashier at a supermarket.  Its a great job if my BA in English fails me.""-Me to JD and Michael (our British tour guide-awesome man!) ""Well, you could always do what I do.  Then again, you might as well stick to cashiering.""-Michael

""So what did you buy?""-Aseem to Michael. ""A bottle of brandy, some chocolate...and some olive oil.""-Michael.  ""That's a random combination""-Xander.  ""Well, yeah I like to bathe in olive oil...it helps me forget.""-Michael.  (I think this was an attempt to make fun of Diana and Sara who say that dancing is their therapy.  This would seem funnier if you were there).  Needless to say, later in the trip we bought Michael another bottle of olive oil prior to our departure, which he took out on his balcony and pretended that he was the pope, blessing the city of Barcelona.

""Donde estan las rambas?""-Diana to drunk Spanish guys.  ""Hahahahahahahahahahaha!""-Drunk Spanish guys, ""Es LA RAMBA, hahahahaha!"" (That was kinda mean)

""I'm not drinking for at least a week after this trip""-Me ""HA, I'm not drinking... until I get back to the US""-Salber (the one who claims I am a ""little girl"").

Finally, I know there has been rough times and I know we've had our ups and downs but I know somewhere out there we will have our peace of mind. I'm sorry for being such a pain in the ass, from now on there's no more questions-I will be confident. Aseem, you are the best friend I could ever ask for. MI MEJOR AMIGO!  Thanks and well, I love ya!

Have a great week everyone-I'm sure mine will be fantabulous with crap loads of work and work three days this week but I'll get by..PEACE!

"event","Sorry for the lack of updates, you know how it goes being terribly busy. I'm home for spring break as of now, however I am leaving tomorow to go back up to UC then head to Spain with the meistersingers on Monday! I definitely can't wait; I have been soo excited about this trip for the past couple weeks and now it is finally almost here!

Here's what has been going on otherwise, up until now:
~Pledging ended a few weeks ago. It was definitely awesome spending so much time with everyone. I feel like we don't get to hang out at all now cause we went from spending like almost every waking moment with each other until now. My big sis Tia gave me my first pair of letters with cows on them! They kick ass! I also have my cool jacket willed down from Christy, who was an alumni of Uphi which is awesome too. And pretty soon we are getting our own new jackets which will be black with green letters! We had a little bit of a party the other night and perhaps Tish and I had too much fun. Happy Bday Claire and Momma Burps! :)

~Forensics is over for me this year. I am gonna miss my duo piece :(. Its amazing how many schools take interpt events a bit differently than we do. Met a really cool girl named Kristen who goes to Upenn. Next year I plan on really getting my pieces down and making a lot of improvements. It was a good learning year. I'm gonna miss Lauren, whose a senior-you rock Lauren! :)

~I applied for study abroad/the international house. Can't wait to find out about them, especially about Italy! I'm sure everything's all cool; I will find out after break!

~Back in Htown now seeing my girls tonight. Dinner and a power hour, YES! Last night, Em Dereck and I went up to Harant's apartment and chilled with Harant and Kyle. I made Harant a facebook page-go add him as a friend!!

~I watched my niece today. I took her for a long walk around the neighborhood and the shopping center. It was very nice out! My niece is really growing attached to me. I am going to be watching her a lot more this summer. And yes I have been watching my mouth, especially now that she talks. ""what's that?"" is a popular phrase..

Oh well, just can't wait! Its gonna be great, leave love if you want a present or a post card, I think I'm just gonna bring them back to avoid having to mail them and all. Have a great remainder of the break everyone! :)

<3 chrissy

Danimal I miss you :("

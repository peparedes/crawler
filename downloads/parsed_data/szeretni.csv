"event","I just found out my ex bf is getting married tomorrow.
Next moment it felt like I had a huge lump of ice in my stomach. 
It's been nearly 10 years since I saw him, since we lived together and had a relationship. I broke up with him and perhaps I shouldn't be broken up about it, but I still think I liked him more than he liked me.
The relationship, the living with him, the realising that he didn't know me at all and really wasn't interested in me, the breaking up and the aftermath - it all hurt me so much, it hurt my very core and soul, and I guess it still affects me.
This is surprising, I haven't thought about him for a long while... I didn't think I'd feel this way.

I'm bitter and jealous and I don't see why he should be happy and get love. I'm not happy for him at all.
I know I should be a good person and be happy for him, but I'm not.
OK, deep down I probably feel like it's good for him but...right now, it just hurts."

I guess some would say that the drama is over the top and exaggerated, but I really like this style. I like strong emotions, and especially when there is no hope in sight. ;)
Yes, I said angsty. ;)

I'm watching season 4 now and the thing that I'm most fascinated by right now is the fact that Andrew Gower (Cutler) sounds and talks just like David Thewlis sometimes. It's freaky! They have the same sort of lips, the same speech patterns, the same accent...but not all the time. Sometimes he sounds a little different, then all of a sudden he gets angry or frustrated and you could close your eyes and easily imagine it being Thewlis. :D

I wrote about Michael Socha before, didn't I? He and his sister, so alike! Especially the eyes and eyebrows. :D
And yes, of course, their accents aswell."

There are others floating about, but that particular one is the best way to ensure that your voice gets heard. It&#39;s hosted on the directgov website and addresses parliament directly. If it gets more than 100,000 signatures, it becomes eligible for discussion in the House of Commons.<br /><br />Everyone&#39;s been getting so worked up over SOPA -- and rightly so -- that ACTA seems to have slipped under the radar. This is hugely problematic, because ACTA is a similar bill, but it has the potential to be far more damaging than SOPA ever could be.<br /><br />Some people seem to have this misconception that ACTA is the &#39;European SOPA&#39;, but that simply isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s a global treaty, and it&#39;s already been signed by eight countries, including the US, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore. Europe votes on Thursday. If they vote &#39;no&#39;, the bill will have to be taken back to the drawing board and reformulated, which should buy us some time at the very least.<br /><br />If you think this doesn&#39;t affect you, you&#39;re wrong. If ACTA passes, it could well signal the end of the internet as we know it, and that isn&#39;t an exaggeration. It&#39;s not just about watching movies and television online. If ACTA passes, sites like YouTube, Livejournal, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook and even Google and Wikipedia could become impossible to maintain. ACTA would allow ISPs to monitor your net activity and cut off internet access for your entire household if one person is suspected of breaching copyright. Think Big Brother is Watching. I don&#39;t think I need to emphasise just how damaging it can be to be without internet access in this day and age, when we rely so heavily on technology.<br /><br />It&#39;s not only bloggers and fandom that would be affected, either. Small businesses, independent film-makers and unsigned musicians who have previously found their niche online would also suffer hugely, and would be at risk of being bullied into submission by Hollywood and multinational corporations under accusations of copyright infringement. All those artists who found fame by uploading covers of songs to YouTube would never have had the opportunity to do so under ACTA, as those cover versions would be prohibited.<br /><br />I know the internet has its problems, but to my mind it&#39;s the single greatest invention to come out of modern times, and it would be an absolute travesty if we were to lose that now. From a personal point of view, I can&#39;t even put into words how important this is to me. I&#39;ve met some of my closest friends through the internet and online fandom, people whom I would likely never have met without it, and it&#39;s given me this amazing social support system. I don&#39;t want that to end here, and I want to preserve it for future generations so that they can have the same experience and opportunities I&#39;ve been given through my online interactions.<br /><br />I know that opinions on the seriousness of copyright infringement and online piracy vary wildly, but that isn&#39;t really the point. Internet giants such as Google are opposed to this bill, and it&#39;s pretty safe to say that they&#39;re not in favour of copyright infringment, as anyone who&#39;s ever had a fanvid taken down from YouTube will be painfully aware. Whatever your stance on copyright, this isn&#39;t the way to go about dealing with it. This is dangerous legislation that impeaches on some of our most basic human rights, such as the right to privacy and freedom of speech.<br /><br />So if you&#39;re from the UK, please, please sign the petition. If you hail from elsewhere in the world, there may well be similar movements in your own country, but I think the most effective thing anybody can do right now is to keep talking about this. Talk about it on Livejournal, on Twitter, on Tumblr, on Facebook, and anywhere else you can think of. Make sure this issue is never far from people&#39;s minds. The internet is an amazingly powerful tool: let&#39;s utilise it while we still have the chance.<br /><br />Please repost and spread the word :)<br /><br /><a href=""https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/20685"">SAY NO TO ACTA!</a><br /><br />Please consider reposting this, especially if you have a large proportion of UK flisties.

From the moment I met you, I knew I would like you and perhaps I saw something of myself in you - like we often do. Now I know what it might have been... Were you sad or troubled? Did you feel lonely? Was the pain of life too much for you to bear? I will never know why you killed yourself but I know what it feels like in those moments when you feel despair and when you feel like there is no hope left.

You didn't show it when we met. You seemed incredibly happy and liked you enjoyed your life! Did something happen after that, that made you change? Or did you just hide it well?

"event","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Action<br /><br /><br />Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that has been developed by tens of thousands of volunteers from all over the world over the last 11 years. Together, we have created millions of articles containing billions of facts, referenced to hundreds of thousands of sources from around the world. We have grown to be one of the most frequently accessed websites in the world. Wikipedians are fiercely proud and protective of our ability to freely share knowledge with the rest of the world, as the first of 846 related projects in 280 languages working under the umbrella of the Wikimedia Foundation.<p>In late 2011, the United States Congress proposed two legislative bills, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act"" title=""Stop Online Piracy Act"">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (SOPA) and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act"" title=""PROTECT IP Act"">PROTECT IP Act</a> (PIPA), which legal scholars and others have advised have the potential to significantly change the way that information can be shared through the Internet. It is the opinion of the English Wikipedia community that both of these bills, if passed, would be devastating to the free and open web.</p><p>Over the course of the past 72 hours, over 1800 Wikipedians have joined together to discuss proposed actions that the community might wish to take against SOPA and PIPA. This is by far the largest level of participation in a community discussion ever seen on Wikipedia, which illustrates the level of concern that Wikipedians feel about this proposed legislation. The overwhelming majority of participants support community action to encourage greater public action in response to these two bills. Of the proposals considered by Wikipedians, those that would result in a &quot;blackout&quot; of the English Wikipedia, in concert with similar blackouts on other websites opposed to SOPA and PIPA, received the strongest support.</p><p>On careful review of this discussion, the closing administrators note the broad-based support for action from Wikipedians around the world, not just from within the United States. The primary objection to a global blackout came from those who preferred that the blackout be limited to readers from the United States, with the rest of the world seeing a simple banner notice instead. We also noted that roughly 55% of those supporting a blackout preferred that it be a global one, with many pointing to concerns about similar legislation in other nations. For example, one British editor stated &quot;American law is America&#39;s business, but law that affects Wikipedia worldwide is an issue of worldwide interest&quot;, a principle we felt had considerable support.</p><p>Therefore, on behalf of the English Wikipedia community, the Wikimedia Foundation is asked to allocate resources and assist the community in blacking out the project globally for 24 hours starting at 05:00 UTC on January 18, 2012, or at another time as determined by the Wikimedia Foundation. This should be carried out while respecting technical limitations of the underlying software, and should specifically prevent editing wherever possible. Provisions for emergency access to the site should be included in the blackout software. In order to assist our readers and the community at large to educate themselves about SOPA and PIPA, these articles and those closely related to them will remain accessible for reading purposes if possible. Wikipedians are urged to work with WMF staff to develop effective messaging for the &quot;blackout screens&quot; that directs readers to suitable online resources. Sister projects, such as the German and Italian Wikipedias and Wikimedia Commons, have indicated an intention to support the same principles with banners on those sites, and the support of other projects is welcome and appreciated.</p><p>Internal Wikipedia processes that are dependent upon time-specific discussions, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship"" title=""Wikipedia:Requests for adminship"">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion"" title=""Wikipedia:Articles for deletion"">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a> discussion should be considered suspended during the course of the blackout, and their scheduled duration extended 24 hours.</p><p>Signed,</p><p><b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NuclearWarfare"" title=""User:NuclearWarfare""><font color=""navy"">NW</font></a></b> <i>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NuclearWarfare"" title=""User talk:NuclearWarfare""><font color=""green"">Talk</font></a>)</i> 23:46, 16 January 2012 (UTC)<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Risker"" title=""User:Risker"">Risker</a> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Risker"" title=""User talk:Risker"">talk</a>) 23:48, 16 January 2012 (UTC)<br />&mdash; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Billinghurst"" title=""User:Billinghurst"">billinghurst</a> <i><span style=""font-size:smaller""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Billinghurst"" title=""User talk:Billinghurst"">sDrewth</a></span></i> 23:49, 16 January 2012 (UTC)</p><dl><dd><dl><dd>On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation, I thank all editors who participated in the conversations, and we accept the recommendations, and will work hard to follow the recommendations to the best of our ability.

I&#39;ve seen him so many times, in small roles. I remember liking him even the first time I saw him, which was in the Office, and then his small role in Love Actually.
Of course, how could I not love him when he plays some of my favourite characters: Arthur Dent, Dr Watson and now Bilbo. :D

So, no spoilers for the Reichenbach Falls but like all the other episodes - marvellous. I love this show, love the actors.
Except for the guy playing Moriarty and his lines. Don&#39;t like them.
I keep thinking Mark Gatiss (playing Mycroft Holmes) would&#39;ve been a much better Moriarty... And I don&#39;t know why they&#39;ve written his lines the way they have, it was like whenever he said something it felt wrong and pathetic. Just off, somehow.

I think it was the 10 yr anniversary and the making of the Hobbit that set this off again. :)</li><li>David Thewlis, still. :) Although I&#39;m starting to suspect that he might be an ass in real life...but am trying to deny it. Also Gary Oldman. Also starting to suspect that I wouldn&#39;t like him in real life but am trying to ignore that also. I might just have to admit that they&#39;re grumpy old men who can still be good actors. ;)</li></ul>I still haven&#39;t seen Thor, but it&#39;s on my list. Guess I have to see The Hulk too, since it kinda goes with The Avengers...<br />Also on my list of things I want to see: Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy, The Hobbit, Sherlock Holmes 2, Anonymous, The Lady, Revolution of The Apes - or what is it called? And I want to see the rest of Game of Thrones, which I havent yet seen."

An old tradition, we celebrate Santa Lucia. Sweden isn't really a religious country but we still celebrate many christian traditions, even those of us who are pagan or atheist do. ;)

Here are two clips with some lovely traditional Swedish Lucia-music.

The second one is an hour long, with some Swedish talking that you can skip, but the singing is flawless.

Now, I know this might seem like nothing big to you living in big cities or countries, but for a small country like Sweden - nothing like this has ever happened before. :(

Fortunately, it seems like he only killed himself and that only two other people were hurt and not severely...but this means that it CAN happen, and it could have been so much worse if he'd been good at ""blowing things up"". :(

So yeah, it is kinda scary..."

So, naturally, I loved it. :D

It's got William Shatner, Billy Dee Williams, Carrie Fisher, Ray Parks (cool as always), Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes... If you're a geek, you know why they're in the movie. ;)

And Kristen Bell, who is brilliant as always. I totally loved her character and extra bonus points for getting the cutest geek, played by Jay Baruchel (who totally looks like a young Paul Dinello).

Minus points for being mean to Trekkies, but...you're forgiven.

"event","Sooooooooooo. Its been a while, I dunno why I felt like updating I just did. Haven't really been on this so much, I guess its kinda fell by the way side. 

 Incase you haven't noticed I am now in Missouri. Its boring out here, but thats not such a bad thing. I am able to save my money considering I have people I need to pay off soon. And I can get a car and get back on my feet and hopefully go to school.

 I wanna change, I'm going to start taking advantage that I can walk next door to the Elks lodge and use the weight equipment. I've been dreaming of my past crushes lately, and that we actually hung out and they actually liked me. And I realized I'm sick of being scared. I swear the next girl I actually like I'm just going to be straight with it. I'm going to tell her and see what happens. Too many times have I sat on the sidelines and watch while the 3 major crushes I've ever had moved on to someone while I sat by and was support. Whatever. Its time to change.

On the other hand, its been propelling me to actually start writing my romance script. I've finished two issue's of my comic idea, and trying to work it out. I need to find friends out here to pass the time, go to shows and such. 

   If I could change one thing I would have handled friendship better with certain people, but I'm not going to be the one who does everything. I need to figure out where I need to be. IN life, in love in everything. 

  I dunno, I just have been thinking about different things I could have changed in a certain relationship where I felt like I was doing all the work, so I just cut the person off. And its been propelling my thoughts of other things. Other relationships. 

That was a ramble, but its a new start, and I hope when I'm done with my time here I'm a little bit of a better person, and hopefully meet a nice girl. Hahaha. 

Love for-fucking-ever.
Vella."

"event","Wow. I was looking over real old lj entries. Man, I was a shithead when I was younger. All though I did find this which I actually liked. I wrote it a while ago in regards to something. I'm not sure what. Yeah, I guess I've just been reflecting on things. I just read all my old lj entries from like late 2001 early 2002 until now. Some crazy stuff.

forget. everything. i. ever. said. believe in yourself for when im gone you wont remember and i cant forget. every heart break and all the words cut out formed by letters of your lost hope. i dont need this, you dont need me. if its a burden to you i will go, with out a word, with out a wish, with out the blood that you now hold. keep it with you at all times. our time will remain untarnished, your bonds, your friendship, everything that was once truth. Diseased and decrepit, it will crumble. my world shatters, and you are too silent. silence that annihilates my ear drums. pulse out through the heart. it meant nothing. i see now, my empty stomach, your empty hands. i meld with your abstinence. forget suicide, i am the new genocide. genocide for your causes. your embelishment, i am nothing but a pawn. and you are nothing but a faceless leader. i will sacrafice you for the greater good. greater good of your moth ridden quilt which you kept hidden. i am done, am i? tell me before its too late, so i can walk away with my own legs and not the prothstetics you have prescribed. Please let me leave on my own accord. I do not accuse you of anything, i only accuse myself... for believing a false prohpecy, written on disintegrating paper. watch out, or your message will detonate on impact. my brain will not harbor your wishing well any longer. Please... i beg... let me walk on my own two feet, let me walk away on my own. Your prothstetics are not needed here. I am sorry for you and your hurt, your feeling the need to take the blame when you are trying to help. But you have never focused on me long enough to see the truth. you shall wear your blindfold for enternity, forced forever to sink. so i ask once again to let me leave on my own accord... never again shall i harm your way of life. i was foolish, i was young. i blamed you once. i blamed you for not helping me when i came out of that ambulence, and into your surgery room. So please let me walk away on my own two feet. You'll not regret it. because life is not constant, and you are too great for me to hold. too great to clip the wings of your everything. My nothing is my own cross to bear. i will struggle on my own two feet, i need not your chemicals to make me happy. Just please.... let me go. on my own. without your bickering or your prescriptions... i need to find myself, i need to do this on my own... my own justification, my own realization that in life, you make your own rules. you follow your own demons to their deaths. in this world you contract H.I.V and keep it to yourself... i am walking away now. you won't cry, so don't pretend. i see now, i've pretended for far too long. becasue all those talks at night, all the times i've tried to bridge the gap between us, you've pushed it away, and don't pretend it was nothing more than that... make believe. our time here is short and i am walking on my own accord... my own rules. because pretending got us no where, and your assessment of my situation, always lead me astray. because your hellos were empty, and mine were too full, bursting upon you like an acidic welcome to my inner most sanction. so im leaving now. and your trying to analyze my condition gets us further apart still. for you are the doctor and i am the patient... we can never meet at a thin line, nor walk the green grass of the courtyard... because in the place where the end justifys the means, all your naked whispers of friendships, and im sorrys mean nothing , and my making excuses for my condition and your place in society are faded and worn. And hello never meant i need you and im sorry will never mean i care... it is all just a fading signal, and your memory will soon fade,and i will run away, and pretend anew just like always, and you'll forget, convinced with your theorems and your hopeless indulgence of introspection. then where will we be? again apart, again never knowing the other existed, except for that one time, when we sat, talked in that abandoned white room. the nothingness void except one anothers voice, carrying us on ward. But you will march on, and i will stay behind as always. Thinking of you becoming more distant, my words meaning nothing to your notes on yourself, and me and everything we used to be. Your charts on how the world works, and how i should act. because you are strong and i am not. because that crimson soaked scalpel you hold now is too deep within me to forget, i will not forget. but time is not as kind to me as it is to you. and im sure when you stop thinking of that one patient that tried to bridge the gap, i'll still be thinking of the doctor that stood with scalpel in hand and said ""i wish i could know you, but see its not in my will to do so. violating the sacred law which i hold, and choose to up hold"". you've made your choice and i've made my mine. I'm tired of fighting to stay sick for you. so im walking out on my own accord, no help needed. Im not trying to patch things up with you any longer, your services are no longer needed. i can help myself. ""But what about the bill?"" you say, as if those talks meant nothing, as if you were just doing your job. But now as i walk out, using my own hardened skin to stitch the wounds on my body, i see the job is all you were ever doing, and me, being a person meant nothing, me...being the job of human ethics to be polite. up holding that code... I meant nothing, i paled compared to that. and thats where you exceed at your job. Upholding that stand you yourself set for you... is all you ever cared of, and rightfully so. My epiphone being acknowladged, i turn to you and say. ""My insurance will cover it. but... my insurance, will never cover the void"" and you shrug and smile, and utter those deadly words. Still forever holding that bloody scalpel. the smile in your eyes. ""Have a nice day, and thank you for picking my hospital, i hope your stay has been most enjoyable.."" and you cheerily move on to the next patient... who was just as bad as i was. and you talk to him, and you give him hope, but you mislead yet another... Fore you were just doing your job.. and the job... is all that counts... you fucking predator........"

A couple weeks a go we went on Three Fifteens last tour with them, and played their last show. One of my favorite bands from Western Mass, amazing to play with them.

The band is really starting to pick up which is good, its a lot of fun, and I hope this continues on forever. I know it won't so I'm soaking it up as much as possible. 

I've been working alot, and will continue to do so. 

I am carless, because of carelessness, and procrastination on my part. Bad vella. But, I am saving up for a van which will be a sweet van.

Everyone was just there for fun, and no one was too macho. Which is always good. It really reinvitalized my interest in Hardcore which had been waning as of late. Its great to see that kind of stuff, plus free food.

Oh man I am SO excited for the FlyWheel show with Wasteland and No Trigger. NT just got signed to Nitro and they're new stuff sound so good. I think I might take my car off the road this summer, and bike everywhere. But we'll see. Um so far everything is all right, I'm pretty broke right now, but it happens. So the band is going great, so excited for that, and everything is all right about now. 

My mother might be moving back up here, which is another plus. I dunno if in mass, but at least in New Hampshire, which is only 2 hours instead of 2 days. 

Well thats it I guess. Drop me a line sometime, and go March 25th to the FlyWheel. It will be an amazing show. I'm really pumped for it, and not just cause we are playing. Thats all. Thanks

"event","So I saw Coheed and Cambria last night. They signed stuff. I wish I could have talked to them more, buttt people decided to show up 2 minutes before and us being there since like 2 got screwed kind of. But oh well, its nice they wanted EVERYONE to get a chance. Um, I wish people didn't hold people like that on pedastals, yeah they make great music, but then it makes them become reclusive. I wish they came by and talked to us in line. I think if I was in a band I would make an effort to talk to fans all th time. I'm sure it gets boring butt. Yeah. So I really REALLY just want to have a normal conversation with them. Also people only see Claudio. Yeah he writes the story, but theres the band too. Anyways thats my rambling. 

THe new album is amazing, the old albums are amazing. They are amazing. I can't stop talking about them, or listenning to them. I can't wait for Nov 11th. Whos with me.

Oh by the way, no more Vegetarian for me. I ate meat today for the first time in 3 years. I don't care anymore. Plus, it was a mistake. At Taco Bell I got the crunchwrap. But forgot to ask for beans instead of meat cause I wasn't thinking. Thus I still mind elsewhere, started to eat it. Before long I was like this tastes funny for beans, and I noticed it was meat. Didn't care. Kept eating. I could have just toughed it out stoppped eating, but I don't care. Dust to dust. Its an excuse probably I know, but oh well...


Working this weekend. See you around..

Coheed and Cambria is amazing go pick it up.

"event","We're happy to simply gloss over it -- perhaps the biggest tragedy of all to come from these horrible events. We blame the media, blame video games, blame extreme music. Basically, we blame everything except poor parenting, a complete lack of discipline practices, and a social set-up that encourages the alienation and persecution of any student who is different, smart, or in any way quirky and deviant from the rigid status quo. While we went on and on about violence video games and movies, we completely failed to address the obvious roots of the problem because it required us to point the finger squarely at ourselves. That's something we've never been very good at doing. 

I would not sit here and try to tell anyone that violent entertainment does not trigger violent behavior in certain people. It's obvious that it does, just as The Holy Bible has triggered extreme violence in masses of people throughout the centuries. The question we should be asking is not why we have these violent movies or video games. The question is simply why are people today so monumentally stupid that they can't grasp something as basic as the difference between real and make-believe? 



i don't know why i think it just needed to be said this is an exerpt by the way."

"event","SO..... Its been a bit since I've updated.  BUTTT. I'm addicted... I have to say it I'm addicted. I'm addicted to Battle Royale. Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 film anddddd Koushun Takami's book. OH MY GOD. ONe of the most amazing things I've ever read. Wow, it combines like George Orwell's 1984 theme with the Government being oppresive and ugly. But puts so much more into the characters, I think. I dunno. Its also a modern story. But it  has love, and anger, hate.  As well as political and social themes. Man. And the movie is really well done, and doesn't stray from the book. Which I like. We all know what happens when we stray. Ahem (Dawn of the Dead remake, Resident Evil Movies) Yeah, plus the acting was well done, and ahem Chiaki Kuriyama. HAHAHAH SHHhh. Well yeah. So, its renewed my interest in doing movies again. Well I never really fell of that. 

The Get up Kids last show in massachusetts was on Saturday. THAT WAS AMAZING. I'm so glad I got to see them, they started me off. Its come full circle. I first saw them there, and last saw them there. How ironic? Maybe thats not the right words. Oh well, they don't come easy. 

Two new Boys Night Out songs are amazing. I'm hooked. Warped tour soon. Friday Mental cd release with Jorn. 

I could go on, but well, its trivial stuff anyway. You know what that means?

(Seriously, I recomend you to see Battle Royale, or read the book, actually read the book first. )
Love. 
Much.

Bane and the Suicide File show, kicked my ass. Literally. Wow, I don't think I've ever been kicked or jumped on so much. hahaha. But it was fun never the less. 

In other news, I'm a nerd and got the PSP, probably fucking myself over for car insurrance, but it should be good. Because they take it out of my accounyt so, it will just be a bounced check which kind of sucks. 

Umm, graduations are soon  for people, thats cool. 

Modern Life Is War comes out tuesday, but I prolly won't have enough money to buy it until the friday after... OH well...

"event","So this weekend actually turned out to be alot of fun. Friday I had to work, but after that I got Jon, and dropped James off home. We were gunna go to Taco Bell but I decided I didn't feel like it, so we went to stop and shop, got some snacks and went back to Jays.


There we proceeded to watch Team America. Hilarious. Muhammed Jyhad. OH MAN. I couldn't stop laughing, then we watched Cannibal The Musical after taht. Again, I couldn't stop laughing. I love Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It was my 34 time seeing Cannibal but only my first for TAWP. My jaw hurt. 

Saturday I had to work at 10, and heard the Bane show was sold out. I didn't believe it. It was graduation at WSC... Anyways, so got A TON OF FOOD AND A CASE OF SODA> Grabbed Jon and Robles and went up to Bane... Of course it was sold out, and we didn't get in. I was saddened, but I would have been more so if we didn'ttry and I would have thought about maybe I could have gotten in all night.  So backup plan was a scavenger hunt with Robles' brother and friends...After going to the mall to talk to Allan, and seeing matt and laura, we went back at like 10. And then not many people wanted to do it. So we made a list and it ended up being Me, Jon, Robles and Carrie. 1 hour to find like 12 things, me and Jon vs. Carrie and Robles.  We tied... We didn't get a house number and a picture with someone doing the shocker, they didn't get letters from a sign or a golf flag. All in all it turned out to be alot of fun. Then we slept over Robles. Hung out the next day. Saw people. 

We were bored so me and Jon saw Star Wars. Now I'm not a big Star Wars fan, but you just HAVE to see how Darth Vader happens. Plus I'm a nerd as well. It as a good flick, you should see it.  Then we went back to Jays to watch Family Guy, but it wasn't on. So yeha, all in all the weekend turned out to be more fun than I thought it would have been after Bane fell through... Yes, um Allan Mike and I need to hang out soon. We're doing a HUGE scavanger hunt in 2 weeks, so let me know if you want in. 

Mucho love <333

Again, I say this all the time, but you know the digits, hit it up.

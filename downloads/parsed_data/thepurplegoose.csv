I am sorry if you don't like me or Justin or "" The best friend relationship"" that we have but that does not mean you can go on his journal and freakin right crap about us on there that is uncalled for. Justin and I are nothing more than friends and we like it that way. SO if you have something to say please tell me in person instead of hiding out in some live journal!!!!!!!!!!!!

Haha at work on Saturday I was in concessions but somebody I guess could not get to the toilet and pooped(yes i said pooped) all over the place and the girl that was doing usher could not clean it so the ""woman"" that I am cleaned it for her. So me and Andrew went to the movies lastnight and my manager told me he had a gift for me(let me add that it is the manager who I have a crush on! I just think he is cute he is way too old for me!) They gave me a $20 gift certificate to Sticky Fingers. I have never been there so Andrew, Ryan and I went today for lunch. It was okay it was not fantastic. SO then Justin called and of course I missed his call but he called Andrew. So we went to Justin's house and he asnwered the door and made the worst face ever it was so funny Ryan and I were cracking up. We chilled at his house for awhile and then went to the movies. I had a GOOD TIME with all my men!haha My managers think I go out with them all ha! you know me........jk so anyways I am waiting for somebody to get home and call me so I am goin to go read Sam's book she let me use..it is called Running with Scissors it is pretty good.......

"event","I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles
In our eyes are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned
And I have to speculate that God himself
Did make us into corresponding shapes like
Puzzle pieces from the clay
True, it may seem like a stretch, but
Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled
Head when you're away when I am missing you to death
When you are out there on the road for
Several weeks of shows and when you scan
The radio, I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great
Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
'come down now,' but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave this all on your
Machine but the persistent beat it sounded
Thin upon listening
That frankly will not fly. you will hear
The shrillest highs and lowest lows with
The windows down when this is guiding you home
~The Postal Service

I love that song it makes me think of somebody who I will not name on here.
Anyways so today was going so well...........Jenna came and picked me up from school becasue I did not feel like driving to lunch but we went to lunch and it was grood! After that we went to CC and looked at cameras and computers and I played this x-box game where you hit drums and clap your hands it was pretty funny. Then I tried calling Katlyn and it hung up so she called back and I decided I would sing her a litle tune! The i called Eylse and left her a message this is what is said.....Um yes I am calling for a Eylse Addington I just wante dto let you know that your PUSSY cats are ready to be picked up from pets plus from the groomer. Please call 1-800-PUSSY I am sure you are just out around town PUSSING around. Ok have a wonderful Pussy day! It was really funny and if some of you don't understand well Eylse hates the word Pussy!Anyways so then we went and hung out with Daniel and Jessica and my little bro Josh. Josh is so cute he cracks me up. so then we had to go pick hunter up casue we forgot about him but i mean who cares about hunter?jk so then I went to church and then back to CABC to say my good-byes to Daniel jessica and Josh then my mom called and well we won't fo there becasue that is what messed up my night. I am really glad I got to see daniel and family because I miss them and I have a lot goin on right now and it was just good to see them. haah Daniel has hair now! I don't like it....that is funny though because I hated it shaved and he used to like rub his head on me and stuff.........gross but he told me he was goin to shave it and that he was goin to take a picture with his hair in his hand and then he posed for me and then he siad he was going to make a unabrow(that is not how you spell that) with it and take a picture.gross I can't wait to get those! abyways well I am off to bed!

"event","So this is funny that I am writing in here or should I say typing...I have another website to where I share my thoughts but I don't go into depth about it. I have a notebook here with me, I write in it everyday. In that book I write whatever is bothering no matter what it is because I know I am the only one who will ever read it. This is the thing.........I don't know why but tonight I feel compelled to share everything in here...I am 18 years old which makes me a teenager, yes a teenager who is still trying to define myself. Not everyone is perfect..we are going to make mistakes if it is trying drugs,drinking,messing up with a boyfriend girlfriend relationship,lieing to friends family whatever it is we will make mistakes. We were not made to be perfect...I hate it when someone close to you dies, I mean who dosen't? To me losing your best friends is like them dieing not ever coming back.  I once had this friend who always told me that it did not matter what other people think just live your life to your fulliest expectations..yea people might talk and it might hurt but living life is not always supose to be easy or painless. Sometimes we let things slip right form our fingertips and we don't even realize it becuase we are always caught up in a black cloud that hides the stuff that means the most to us. Sometimes we try to hard to be liked and that is just how society is these days but sometimes you don't even try at akk and you get juged..like This guy I know told me that he thought I was some scary gothic girl when we first met. Now that I think about it it puts a smile on my face becuase I know I am way to far to ever becoming that.  I hate it when people judge you it is liek your not aloud to make any mistakes ever in your life here on earth but yet it is okay for them to judge and talk about peropl anytime they want. Your probably wondering what the crap I am talking about but that is the best part becuase I don't even know what I am talking about. I have so much to learn befor eI can even begein to comprehend what I am saying. But have you ever wanted something so bad that to see them want something els instaed hurts? That is how I feel right now.I am not going to say who or what it is about becuas ehtat person knows who they are but it is almost liek you have tried to hard and instead of getting their attention you have drove them away........It sucks so freakin bad but you know ther is nothing you cna do but to accept what is going on that is the only way you are going to solve anything. Life is to short to be worried over little things. I am going to end here with that but I am glad I got that out..Now I am off to writing in ""THE NOTEBOOK"" And then finishing up some studying for a test that I will probably fail. 

Thanks for listing,
